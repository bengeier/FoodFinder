{"text":"I go to this place... A LOT as my son likes the food there.  Standard HK style chinese / westernized food.  It's popular, reasonably priced and they do make the food competently.

My son knows the servers very well.

This is not top end food but their selection is vast and it is popular enough to have line-ups at peak hours despite a good sized dining area.

Try to choose something off their \"meal specials\" as you get a free drink with it.  They have morning, afternoon tea and all day specials in their meneu."}
{"text":"I ve been here twice one the past month.  Once for the regular menu and yesterday foe the tea time menu.


It much pricier than others palce and it very basic. Tasting


I had the Malaysian curry chicken and roti   
$8.50  & 3.75    tasted like average food court.   Not complex tasted like it came out a a fancy jar from pusateri fine food.   1/5


And the hong kong style waffle....smelled great and made hit and fresh.   But tasted like a kid made from one of those toys oven than makes makes at home. 
1/5


Hong Kong tea     solid 4/5


It ia new and clean ish for now.   I can back once since I was in mall to run errands but probably won't go back.



Nothing special. ... I rather go to food court close by"}
{"text":"The dessert from the restaurant is very great. Judging from the dessert almost I would give them a 5 star. 
The settings and decoration are beautiful inside the restaurant.
The price is reasonable and affordable.
The servants are polite and helpful.
However, the main meals are not as great. I give them a4 star simply because their main meals could be better"}
{"text":"I have only been here a few times. Generally good food. The Hainan chicken is the best dish I have had so far. The dipping sauce for it is quite good. Watch out for your breath after though! GARLIC! Staff is OK. Generally rushed which is ok but sometimes rude. Otherwise a decent place to eat."}
{"text":"Always busy...a bit pricey compared to other HK cafes but food is very consistent.  Best fried port cutlet in and fish bone broth noodle soup in town!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try, the Woodbine location of this chain.  Really not worth the effort.

The exterior of the restaurant is unappealing enough, with a run-down parking lot that's part of a building complex that looks more like a collection of industrial stores than an eatery.  I ordered the pork/chicken chop combo and while it's somewhat nice to get it less than two minutes later, it also blatantly shows that the food was not prepared fresh -- it's pre-made and they just pour the gravy on it after you order.  The side rice is fine, a simple egg fried rice, but the vegetables are truly pathetic -- they are so cold and lifeless that you wonder why they don't even bother to keep it in some kind of food warmer.  The meat was mediocre, not unacceptable, but also completely uninspired.

An extra star ducked for inattentive service.  Took about 10 minutes for them to take the order and another five to get the check after the meal.  While I can confidently say that the staff isn't unpleasant or deliberately inattentive, they also appear either overworked or just not very good at it.

I had been thinking of coming to this place as an alternative to Metro Square Cafe on Steeles, but one visit is enough.  Phoenix Restaurant doesn't even come close to measuring up to Metro Square Cafe or Tasty Delight at Leslie and Finch, the two other Hong Kong steakhouses I know in the area."}
{"text":"Suggested by friends. Extremely disappointing. We will not return .#haiku review. (this place isn't even worth a full review)"}
{"text":"Honestly, I would not recommend anyone to come here. The food was not of high quality and there were the most random things on the menu: SPAM?? The waiters took a really long time to get our order and afterwards took a long time to get the bill. Would probably never come back if I could avoid it."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here. However, over the past few years, both the quality of the service and the food have decreased DRASTICALLY. My family and I kept going back thinking it was a one time thing, but it absolutely was not. So disappointing.

1. Food:
The food is actually pretty good, pretty good prices too. However, the portions are smaller now than what they used to serve. 

One time, my mom got the fish soup thing and she found a piece of PLASTIC in it??? 

2. Service: 
Some of the waiters there are nice. However, we've had Waitress Mei multiple times and she is unbelievably rude and barely does her job. My mom asked about one of the options and she just stared back. She didn't even answer her question. 

3. Timing
Let me put this into perspective. I came here with my parents and my brother. My dad's food came at the same time as my brother's, relatively quickly. Fifteen minutes later, I got my food. More than half an hour later, my mom's food STILL hasn't arrived. 

By this time, both my brother and my dad are finished their food already and I am halfway done. Waitress Mei comes back, pokes her head into our booth, and just leaves (???). She comes back 5 minutes later, asks what my mom had ordered, and walks away again. Another 10 minutes later, she comes back to tell us that her food should be done soon. My mom gets her food, finishes a bit, and we ask for a takeout box instead because we want to leave. 

TLDR; the food is good but I don't really trust it ever since my mom found pieces of plastic in it. The service is awful."}
{"text":"I've been to Phoenix a couple of times, but always the location on Woodbine. this is the first time coming to this location, and was surprised to see how nice the decor here is! 

Hainanese Chicken Rice: 
This is probably their most popular dish. The chicken is one of the best I've had. Not only is it lean and tender, the meat is deboned for you! Definitely a bonus. Can't go wrong with this one.

Ying Yang Pork Chop Baked Rice with Cheese:
This dish probably tastes exactly like it sounds and looks. The concept of incorporating the ying yang sauce on pork chop rice was interesting, but I don't think it matched well at all with the cheese. The sauce was too sour in my opinion, and it almost made the cheese taste like it had gone a little off. Definitely wouldn't be a dish I would get again.

Crab Roe Seafood Fried Rice:
This dish was probably my favourite. We actually ordered this because my cousin's Ashley and Hana (6 and 8 year old girls) came here a while back and said it was the best thing they've ever had. So obviously it was something I needed to try. In a nutshell, it's a glorified seafood fried rice made with lots of teriyaki sauce, topped with crab roes for extra texture. I liked it, it came together well. I now declare this dish both adult and child approved. :)

In general, the food was quite good. I'd say the portions are a little small compared to typical chinese places, but definitely enough. Apparently the ice cream crepes here are also very good, so I anticipate coming back here next time to try!"}
{"text":"This is one of my goto places when back home in Markham.
I've tried lots from their menu but somehow got stuck on some rather unusual choices for a hong kong style cafe:  EGG SALAD on wholewheat, milk-tea,  and French toast for dessert.   The egg salad sandwhich is always amazingly fresh and it never disappoints.   I'm not even a huge fan of egg salad sandwhiches i just tried it here one day on a whim and it stuck.   The french toast was another good find.  Its that thick toast you sometimes get at bubble tea places that has been battered and fried and comes with some strange syrup that pours out of a honey container (it ain't honey!).  Its absolutely delicious and for some reason i feel the nice treat is deserved after having such a healthy sandwhich at a fried food joint.    If anyone is interested in trying something new i recommend you go for it.   Staff here are also friendly and always say hi and by when you come and go which is endearing."}
{"text":"I alway ordered the fish tofu fish bone soup noodle as I have dairy allergy.   The chef would mix milk in the broth if you don't have special request.   I think they have the best fish tofu noodle."}
{"text":"(Note this is my first review so it may be mediocre)
Phoenix Restaurant is a \"cha chan tang\" serving up Hong Kong style Western food. I've pretty much visited here for longer than I can remember so the following review won't exactly go into specifics (in the \"food\" section)

Decor:

Now when you walk in their may be confusion as why the decor is different (left side vs. right side). Well, that's cause the left side used to be a different restaurant (Mums I believe it was called) and when they closed down Phoenix took over (but didn't renovate it). The right side (original) has a HK style cafe vibe to it. The chairs and tables just have that sort of feeling of a HK style cafe. Generally seating is moderately comfortable but it can get cramped during busy hours. For my preference, I liked the lighting (like it more on the bright side). However, I noticed some areas were dirty. 

The left side (new) has a more upscale HK diner feel to it. I feel it is more cleaner than the other side and the seating is more comfortable and spacious (especially the booth seats). But, I feel the lighting on this side is more on the dark side, to my dislike. 

They have sort of managed to combine the two contrasting decors with this white thing that houses the lighting (don't know what it's called and that's the best I can describe it) which runs along the ceiling in both areas

Score: 3.5

Service:

The service at Phoenix is pretty much your typical HK style cafe service. They get their job done, but with no smiles or anything like that. They get your order down and bring it to you with no hassle. Quick and efficient. However, if you do come here often enough sometimes they will be a bit nice

Score: 3.25

Food:

This is where (in my opinion) Phoenix really excels. They have a vast selection of food and all of the dishes I have tried have been good. Also, I feel that most of their items are worth it for what they are priced in terms of both quality and quantity. 

Their Hainanese Chicken Rice is AMAZING. Probably the best I've ever had, rice is flavorful, chicken is amazing and has a nice texture to it (the chili sauce that comes with it too is also incredibly delicious). The also really like there cream curry dishes. They may be pricier compared to other dishes but I feel they are worth it. Not too thick, not too runny. Perfect consistency, also the spiciness vs. taste level is also really good. Not burning my tongue off spicy, but not bland (in terms of spiciness). Most of the combo dishes are good too. I could pretty much go on and on about all their dishes (however, I have noticed a lack of an adequate amount of sauce in some of their baked dishes). Their breakfast dishes is pretty good too, but IMO, not as good as their lunch. They have noodle with sausage, ham etc. And also \"plate\" dishes like chicken steak with teriyaki sauce and toast etc. Finally, their drinks are really good too. I feel that their cold lemon iced tea is actually one of the best I've ever had. Its not sugar bomb sweet but its not under sweetened, the amount of lemon they give you has enough taste to give it a subtle but not overpowering lemon flavor.

Score: 4

Final score: 3.6 (rounded)"}
{"text":"Probably my favourite HK Style restaurant in the area.

A little pricier than other HK Syle restaurants (by around $1) but has better quality food. Their Hainanese Chicken is good but I wouldn't consider it their best dish (as most of the reviews saying that the restaurant is bad are judging all of the food based on this one dish...). The curries are good and their baked rice (comes with a fried rice base instead of plain white rice) combos, which are what I usually get, are good as well. The servers are ok/average (friendly but busy and sometimes forgetful if very busy) and the decor is modern with an emphasis on practical.

I would recommend this restaurant to my friends and I go pretty often myself."}
{"text":"Probably the best and most consistent 'HK Diner' restaurant. 
You definitely have to order the HK Milk tea.

Service is prompt and typically friendly. Busy each and everytime I visit."}
{"text":"Phoenix is a great place for solid, HK cafe style food. There are days when the dishes are really good, and others when it's just okay. Known for their Hainanese Chicken, they do one of the better renditions of it in the city - but it is subject to the up and downs of quality that all of Phoenix's food suffers. And the rice isn't yellow enough!

Their HK tea is good, as is their coffee/green-tea shake that reminds me of a kit kat in liquid form. Desserts here are also fun - they have a puff pastry with black sesame ice cream which is rather decent. And the super-tall brick toast is classic.

While you won't be crossing the city to try this place, this Asian diner is my go-to for an HK food fix."}
{"text":"Poor service , poor quality of food, tooo expensive for such a bad quality of food and service. Not agreed or dont know how worst?  Try once then. You will tell all our friends and neighbour never ever go there  Period.

{"text":"Over rated.  Over priced.

I came for the hainanese chicken rice  and it was so fatty and the service was lacking.  I know it is a hk diner, but hey, if I have to pay more for my meal, I expect better food and / or service.

Lunch combos do not come with soup and a drink like many other hk diners do.  

Firefly at first Markham is better in that sense all around.
Food, service, value."}
{"text":"4 Stars for one thing and one thing only....the Hainanese chicken rice. Tender, juicy and oh so delicious.  It's not authentic at all but who cares it's pretty damn good. My favorite in the GTA so far"}
{"text":"I live in the area.

For the past yrs this is the place that I go for HK style food. Food is good, very consistent. Not as good as other Phoneix locations though.

Yet the service is also consistently bad. They are lack of energy, will look at you with no response even you wave at them, and when they finally come you'll have to face their attitude. ZOMBIES, that's how I'll describe the service.

I can no longer stand their service. But as I said I live in the area, it's on my way home and the food is good, so even though I don't dine in anymore, I'd still order take out. Thinking that the bad service will leave me alone? Guess what, they manage to consistently give the wrong order....

Last night I worked late, very tired and wanted food. Order take out again and base on past experience, I repeated my order twice and have the zombie (waiter) who took my order to repeat it over the phone. And sadly I still go home with a wrong order. I should have double check my order right in the restaurant.... That's my fault, and it's also my fault to decide to buy from them. 

Maybe it's just me, but I'm not going there anymore.

The 2 stars is for the food."}
{"text":"My family comes here quite frequently to eat any meal whether it be breakfast, lunch or dinner. Hainanese Chicken w/ rice is hands-down one of their top dishes. It features several pieces of boneless, succulent chicken. This dish is my meat-loving child's favourite. The best drink is the Cold HK style milk tea, which is served chilled without ice. The place has a friendly atmosphere but a somewhat unattentive staff during their busier hours."}

The servers are quick and typical Asian service- no smile, they are clearly just here to take your order and serve you food. We both got the set lunch combo which comes with a free hot drink, all priced at around $6-$10. Fairly reasonable, I prefer their breakfast most yet it only runs until 11 am."}
{"text":"Great food at good price! Cant go wrong here. Hk comfort food! Great for when dinning out with few different friends with different cravings as this place offers so many delicious items on menu. Though they have many locations i find that the raymerville location is the most consistent with the largest portions :)"}
{"text":"Prices are a little expensive considering the food quality. Lunch combo costs $8 including noodles and a hot drink. Yin yang milk tea was good. The noodles are just so-so. One thing that makes me uncomfortable is that waiters assume your tips before you offer. That's not polite. If you're in the mall and just want to grab some food, I'd suggest going for McDonald instead."}
{"text":"Great for afternoon desserts. Some of the combo drinks are interesting mixtures but he chocolate espresso one is a nice mocha flavor. The waffles and French toast are massive!"}
{"text":"I think the average rating for this restaurant is accurate.  Its a solid 3. Decent, but not spectacular. The menu is very, very extensive. I think they really need to cut it down in size. The portugese chicken is my go to dish at this place."}

{"text":"It used to be one of our favourites in the area. Food and services are getting worse and worse lately. Worst time to go would be during week nights. Staff are at their worst when the boss/owner not around. Last time we were there, staff's friends were at the corner table playing cards. They were loud and obnoxious. We rushed out without finishing our dinner which of course ended up paid for the pack up containers. BOOoooo!!"}

{"text":"I was born in Hong Kong and even though I was just a kid when I left there, any HK style cafe brings me back memories of my birthplace. Phoenix has been my go-to HK cafe as of late and I really like their selection especially the baked dishes. Any place that lets you add a fried egg on top of your dish is a place I'll visit again."}
{"text":"Service here  is good, lots of people working
Food is good and it comes quite fast.
They have some pretty good specials that come with a drink, soup, bread and the main course for around or less than 10 bucks. I go there to eat for lunch alot."}
{"text":"Not great. My boyfriend got the Szechuan brisket and green beans on rice and thought it was ok....by no means great. I however got the spareribs in black bean sauce and was very disappointed. The spareribs were dry and had no meat on them. It was all bone and fat. The black bean sauce was good but there was hardly any on the meal. The only thing we really enjoyed were the drinks. He got the winter melon green tea and i got red bean and grass jelly on ice. If we go back it will be for drinks only and not food."}

Breakfast dishes comes with Hk tea or coffee. Ordered satay beef with macaroni soup and French toast. French toast is crunchy on the outside, soft inside.
Macaroni soup was heartening with beef slices and hint of satay sauce. Also comes with toast and condensed milk 

Expect to be in and out within half hour once you get a table. Including tips, we paid 14 bucks. Better than mcdonalds!"}
{"text":"This place has very good Hong Kong style milk tea, Hainanese Chicken (with rice), noodle soup, and Panna Cotta (they call it French style but it's really Hong Kong style). 

You can have a very nice meal for $10."}
{"text":"Solid go to for the standard HK style meal.

For the Westerner, which I am, HK style is a very vague version in Hong Kong of what Western food is; replicated back into Markham: ya follow? Think, if you were in Hong Kong, this is where you would go to find chicken balls. (you get that it doesn't exist in Hong Kong right? Otherwise leave this site and google Mandarin)

But Awesome chicken balls. The food is great, the service is attentive, Pretty much diner level and I love it. I call it a breakfast and lunch spot. We mostly go for breakfast- I love the \"Instant Noodle, with Satay Beef, my kids kill for the Condensed Milk toast, which sounds offensive, but is reaaaaly good.

Check it out."}
{"text":"Standard HK style fast food restaurant. Similar items with competitive restaurants but charges more than others. So-so waiter service."}
{"text":"I love any of the baked riced or pasta dishes - It's what I always order! The service there isn't the best but I mean, they are quick to serve you once you have taken your seat and the food comes out fairly quickly after you've ordered so I really can't complain seeing that it's usually busy here. A lot of high school students come during the lunch hours from Markville High School. I'm intrigued by their new dessert menu that I see in the recent Yelp pictures that others have taken, I can't wait to try it when I visit again! They also make their drinks here really good, Hong Kong style milk tea and cold lemon water is my favourite! If you want something that is inexpensive and yummy, you should definitely try Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Hainan chicken is the best in the area. The fish broth noodle soups are also tasty. A great place if you are in a rush as the service is quick and efficient. The ice lemon tea is very good. Lots of HK dishes and desserts including the trendy waffle ice cream combinations. Tea time is very popular here. The parking is limited and during high times you will have to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"3 stars

Reliable choice for a HK style cafe. Good variety of meal selections and desserts for reasonable prices (under $10)

What I liked:
-modern decor
-prompt service
-food delivered fast and hot
-HK milk tea 
-plenty of baked rice/spaghetti selections 
-unique dish offering of a clam, mushroom sauce, with a puff pastry on top
-combo specials come with a choice of drink (hktea/ice tea) before 5:30pm
-desserts  

What I didn't like:
-helps to know Cantonese when ordering and service in general
-food is good but not exceptional, kind of bland and needs the assistance of spices/salt/sauce provided at each table to kick it up a notch IMHO
-can be very sunny in the restaurant. choose your seating wisely, depending on time of day.
-louder than average atmosphere to have conversations"}
{"text":"Been a little over a year since I've reviewed this place, since then they have added Interac, the food however isn't very good at all. Honestly I've had better at some take-out places in the First Markham food court. 


There are a couple of things Phoenix is decent at, the HK style tea is made well,  and surprisingly the desserts are great here thick milk toast, crepes, waffles with an even rarer choice of black sesame ice cream."}
{"text":"Delicious hk style dishes. Large quantities of food with an inexpensive price. Desserts are amazing too, I recommend the toast bread with ice cream. But I don't recommend the waffles."}
{"text":"Going to this place I thought that it would live up to its reputation...turned out to disappoint me in every way possible.  Service was lousy, food was remedial and place was too crowded."}
{"text":"I found that this location have better customer service than the other two.
We are so used to their milk tea and food that we can't go to other HK style cafe.
We are frequent here because we haven't experience any sticky table, dirty bowls...; not like other HK style cafe that we had to soak our forks, spoons and chopsticks into the complimentary tea for cleaning/sanitize :S 
We've tried a lot of items from breakfast, lunch to dinner; we had no complaints about their food and service at this location."}
{"text":"Food is reasonable quality, though not necessarily better than many other HK style cafes in Markham. The price is also a bit steeper than most others. However, the decor is a little more put together than the others which are usually more hole in the wall kind of places.

Basically if you're looking for cheap authentic HK style cafe food there are better places. But if you're looking to bring people who might want a nicer atmosphere or who need English on the menu this is a solid choice if you don't mind paying a little bit more (e.g. $9-12 or so for a dish)."}
{"text":"A really good place for HK style food with amazing service. The waitress was extremely nice and attentive, and since we were there fairly early, the restaurant was still cleaning up. I noticed that all the chairs were wiped down thoroughly - legs and in between the rungs on the back of the chair - so it was suuuuper clean. The HK milk tea was really good, and the spaghetti soup was pretty good. All in all, good place with great service."}
{"text":"Until recently, I would rate this place 3/5 because it was a decent place to get cheap food. It's no longer cheap in the realm of HK cafes. They've increased the prices with no improvements to anything: service, food, decor; so I don't know what the increase is for. In these types of establishments it has become the norm to be charged extra if you want the cold version of a drink, i.e. Milk and lemon tea.  Usually it's $0.50. This place first increased it to $0.75 and now it's $1.25. That's over 100% increase in the last couple of years. Is ice in high demand? Because you don't get much more drink. Test out the volume between cold and hot. You'll see. Most recently, breakfast for 3 cost us $42 for take out: 3 dishes and 1 egg sandwich. 

Quality is debatable. You'll see a lot of Asian people raving about the Hainan chicken. Personally, I don't get their fascination with this dish and I'm Asian. I'm born in HK! It's chicken with rice and the chicken fat is cooked in the rice. I don't find it a big deal, especially cut of meat you get (it's only dark meat). Generally speaking, most dishes drown in rice. 

The service is rudimentary: seat you and bring you food. If you need anything, wave. Don't ask for anything special because they won't do it, ie leave out certain ingredients. Some of their \"policies\" baffle me. I ordered take out once and they forgot a dish. I get home, noticed and call them. They said they'll take my number down and credit me. I return another day and I don't feel like that dish anymore so i wanted the credit to be applied on something else. What they forgot was a breakfast item and it was now, lunch. They refused citing that it's a limitation with their system.  I have to get the same thing as last time. 

Lastly, they only take cash. Some of their other locations take debit, which is a real inconvenience when you forget which one takes modern payment. We all know why they take only cash as well."}
{"text":"They really need to take debit or credit card.  Could have been a 4 star if they start to take debit or credit card.  It's really a hassle sometimes that you're nearby and you do not have cash and have to drive couple KMs to get cash.

I mean they serve great food, tons of great selections.  They also have great deals on breakfast combos which you get a free milk tea.

Speaking of milk tea, their milk tea is silky smooth, one of the best!

Their selections include sandwiches, pasta, cheese baked dishes, tradition Cantonese food and many many more.  Their selections are so large that it will have something for everyone.

There tend to be lineups on weekends, expect up to 15 minutes of wait during their rush hours and since it's in a plaza, parking is no issue."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in awhile and was in the area so I decided to drop by and try. It has changed a lot. The restaurant style and menu is still the same but the quality of the dish that I tried declined significantly.

Food:
Ordered one of the set lunch A02 (fish tofu noodle soup). Compared to before, the dish has no flavour or taste. Broth was tasteless and very watery. Very little ingredients for the fish noodle bowl and lacked flavour. I couldn't finish it because it was so bad. Definitely not worth going again. 

Service:
Like any HK style restaurant, oder quickly, eat quickly and leave atmosphere."}
{"text":"The service is so bad, I'll never come back even if I want the food. Got conned $10 from this restaurant.

Came here for breakfast on a weekday. There were 4 servers in the front of the house with less than 10 tables in total. The food was good, as usual, but every time a server came to our table to give us menus/food/drinks/the bill, it was a different person. This may not matter but when the bill came, we paid enough to get $10 change, which is what we wanted instead of a bunch of coins. Waited 10 minutes and yet no change from the bill, so we went to the cashier. The cashier had to ask every server to figure out who handled the money and who put the money back in the register. The server who took our money couldn't even remember how much we paid 10 minutes ago, said it was whatever she wrote down. So between the 2 servers, they insisted we paid $17 instead of $27 and were just reconfirming between themselves that we paid $17 so no change needed. (Which wouldn't make sense anyways because whatever we paid included tip, they should give us change no matter what, and the numbers don't add up at all, who would pay for $17 and expect $10 change unless you paid more than $20)  We told them we paid with a green $20 dollar bill and to check their total in the cashier, then they would know they have $10 extra. Nope, they just kept reconfirming between the 2 of them that we paid $17 and not doing anything else about it. So never coming back.  If they can't even handle 10 tables between 4 servers and get people paid correctly, I can't imagine how it is during busy lunch hours. Good luck to whoever comes to this location, better off going to another one."}
{"text":"Yes. Their chicken and rice is super! Chicken is very soft and melts in your mouth. The rice is flavoured with chicken fat so you can eat it by itself. I love the chilli paste oil there. Very spicy.another highlight of the restaurant would be The hk milk tea reminds me of the tea that I would drink back in my home country Burma. The only one I found in toronto so far. I feel nostalgic when I ate their food. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood restaurant. Whenever we go, we always get one order of the Hainanese Chicken and something else. The chicken is always good and is served with the garlic rice. Another one of our favourites is the Honey Pork. It was recommended to us once by a server and ever since then, we order it pretty regularly. Their desserts are pretty good too. We've had both the ice cream with the crepe and the ice cream with waffle. Prices are pretty reasonable. Our bill usually comes to $25. Cash only!"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place but its far too expensive now. I understand cost of food is up and minimum wage increase has brought up the prices. All things considered, ~$18 for Hainanese Chicken Rice and Cold HK Milk Tea including 10% tip is kind of insane for lunch."}
{"text":"THis is hands down my fav Hong Kong cafe- almost 80% of the menu is delicious, my fav being Hainanese chicken ( they remove the bone for you) and their baked Japanese style porkchop. Even my parents who normally only like Northern style Chinese food loves this place. The menu is so extensive, I don't see why anyone wouldn't love this place."}
{"text":"Service is horrible and expensive. The place wasn't busy when I went. They ask us if all the people are here already. Why? It's empty. They kept missing the stuff we order the waitress kept saying \"we are making it\" with full attitude. Seriously? You give me a bowl of noodles in one minute but twenty minutes to microwave a slice of bread? Horrible service and high price surely not worth it"}
{"text":"Although there are many varieties on their menu. The food is just mediocre. Don't be fooled with the fancy design in the restaurant. The plates itself are big but there's not enough food. For their price, you can go to a cheaper Hong Kong style cafe with better food. This place is always busy and the service is meh as well."}
{"text":"I've been going to Phoenix ever since I was a child and it was always one of my childhood favourites. Back in the day it was a little more upscale as the prices were a little higher than many other HK cafes, but over the years the prices of other cafes have gone up. 

It's a pretty popular place for lunch and they usually have super long line ups. They have many options from Hainanese chicken to pad thai to HK style french toast and their price point is around $10-13. 

Their portions are pretty inconsistent. For example for their vermicelli in fish broth has very little noodles but their pad thai is more than enough for one person. They usually have more meat than rice/spaghetti for their baked dishes. 

Their french toasts are very delicious. I love the one with the black sesame filling. 

Overall, I love Phoenix and it is definitely one of my goto HK cafes."}
{"text":"Phoenix is the place to go for fast comfort food. This HK Cafe has several locations, and all of them carry the same menu and same quality of service. 

You're able to grab a quick and filling meal for less than $10, and the portions are generous. Lunch combos come with a drink and the portions are generous! 

Some of my favorites are the Hai-nese Chicken Rice and the Fish Ball Noodle Soup. These two dishes have always stayed consistent throughout the years, and are served within ten minutes! Baked rice/spaghetti dishes usually take longer than anything else on the menu, so if that's what you order, your friends will probably be finished with their food before yours even arrive at the table. 

Prepare for a line-up on the weekends! The Bayview location is less packed and is an equal alternative."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for a quick and cheap, yet tasty meal. Most people order the baked pasta dishes or the Hainanese Chicken Rice (apparently the best). 

The food is decent, but the service isn't the best. Oh well, I did not expect much from an Asian run restaurant/cafe. The food isn't anything to write about, but is fairly consistence every time. This location is a lot less packed than their other location, but the food is pretty much the same."}
{"text":"It's everything you'd expect from a Hong Kong style cafe. 

It's a cheap and quick meal (lunch specials all under $10 bucks).
The food is alright and the portions are generous.
The service is not amazing... as expected.

I met some friends for lunch, there's always a lunch special menu, so we didn't bother looking at the regular items.

We ordered:
*Baked chicken in red curry sauce.
*Two sauces pork chop on rice
*Some form of fried rice with salty fish and assorted seafood

The sauces weren't particularly tasty or spicy.
I'm always a bit disappointed if a HK style place doesn't have black pepper sauce or Portuguese sauce available for baked items.

The HK style tea is really good though.  Worth +0.5 a star good.

I'm not sure if I'd come back here with so many other options nearby."}
{"text":"Great HK style restaurant with a lot of variety to suit everyone's taste! Love their breakfast menu (served until 11am) which comes with a hot drink. Would recommend the HK milk tea which is flavourful and silky smooth."}
{"text":"It's an easy restaurant to go to, your basic cha cha tanggg. The price is alright depending on what you get. All in all a family restaurant to go to when you're not sure what to eat."}
{"text":"I started eating before I took a photo but the food was good. I ordered the Yunnan vermicelli with beef brisket and fish broth. I really enjoyed the broth! It tasted fresh and slightly sweet. The place itself was very busy with a line waiting to get in. But the service was quite fast that we got our food a few minutes after ordering. Price wasn't too bad either."}
{"text":"This chain has deteriorated vastly over the past few years. Food is extremely oily and doesn't taste good. I've had their noodles before - and each time, my lips is just coated in grease. There is also a lack of meat in their noodle dishes.The prices are also high and does not accurately reflect the poor quality of food. Service is terrible, I've had my order mixed up many times - the restaurant is cash only but nowhere is it specified on the door, only when you are paying. I'm not sure why so many people come to Phoenix but there are so many different HK style cafes, you're best to avoid this one as you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I enjoy breakfast here and the Hainanese Chicken is my favourite. It is Boneless Chicken with two dipping sauces with rice and soup. 

The place is very efficient and turnover is quick, as expected in HK style restaurants. I frequent this location because it is right off the highway but it does get really busy. 

It isn't the cheapest HK style place and prices have gone up but for the quality and comfort of seating it is one of my top choices. 

Happy fooding!"}
{"text":"This is a Hong Kong style tea house restaurant, food are very tasty and consistent. It's a fast food restaurant, so don't expect fine dinning service."}
{"text":"A typical HK style cafe with an above average quality of food, slightly cleaner space, and an enormous menu.  This is great for a group of people who don't know what they want to eat - they can each eat chinese style stir fry rice or pasta or steak or noodles.  On top of that, they have quite a few dessert options (waffles) which are great for kids.

The only downside is that it's slowly increasing its prices over the years and by now it's on average about $2 more than other HK style cafes.  It isn't a big deal if you're eating once in a while, but for a family it can be consistently over $10 more per meal."}
{"text":"Very poor service and attitude.went there with my family and order three afternoon tea sets. I asked for an extra regular size paper napkin and was told that due to company policy, each person could have just one. Then they gave me just a couple of very thin, like toilet papers napkins. My son ordered hot dog and the sauce inside was spilling out and he really needed a full size one to to wrap it up for eating in order to keep his hands clean. I am just wondering how much could just a napkin cost and this really hurt the feeling of a long term customer. No matter how many discount coupons they gave away, with such a poor attitude they won't be able to keep their customers."}
{"text":"I would probably give this place a 3.5, but I don't believe Yelp offers this option. The reason for my rating?
I ordered the fish broth with fried tofu. While the fish broth was very yummy, there was a distinct pork taste in addition to the fish flavour and this took me by surprise. That being said, it was a relatively light and yummy broth. The fish tofu balls that they had (I believe they make their own?) were utterly delicious! 
I was so full I couldn't finish the whole thing.

Meanwhile, my Mom and sister ordered the Hainanese chicken rice. They didn't find the chicken all that smooth, but really enjoyed the rice and found it very fragrant and flavorful. My Dad got the beef brisket curry and liked his a lot too.

We ended the meal with two cold HK milk teas. No ice, and it was quite strong. However, one was notice a sweeter than the other, and I would've preferred mine to not be as sweet."}
{"text":"New Menu! Items are newly introduced may be found with yellow/gold highlight. These are mostly fusion items. 

We end up eating our typical fare - cause we know what we want.  The dinner combo set is still one of the best bang for your buck - enough rice to share between 2 not big eaters.

We ordered a side of deep fried squid. Regret. Sadness... just stick with what you know.
Rice and noodle dishes still are the safest."}
{"text":"Phoenix is one of my favourite go-to places whenever I'm in Markham. Although I'm no expert on HK style cafes, I've had my fair share of experiences with different HK cafes in Markham and I believe most of the dishes they serve here taste relatively decent. Likewise, the prices have slightly increased recently but each dish still remains affordable. 

I would highly recommend on getting the combo dishes as it comes with either a hot/cold drink. (extra charge on cold drinks) I usually get the iced lemon tea which is subject to change in flavour - sometimes it's sweet and sometimes it ends up being way too bitter. 

Food-wise I'm pretty sure I've tried most of the items on their lunch and dinner combos LOL. But regardless, I'm usually a fan of the baked dishes, especially the baked chicken steak on rice. 

Since I don't speak Chinese, I'm left with pointing my finger at what I want on the menu but for the most part they usually understand what I'm trying to get at even though they seem a bit annoyed."}
{"text":"I have heard about eating out at Phoenix a billion times from my friends, so I decided to go out for dinner here. I'm a big sweet tooth, which meant I got something from the dessert menu instead of the dinner menu. I got the egg bubble waffle with black sesame seed ice cream on top. It was delicious! The warm waffle and the cold ice cream was a perfect combination. Make sure you find a good ratio of waffle with the ice cream or else you will end up will a lot of excess ice cream and no waffle. The pricing was decent. The entire meal came up to $10, including tip! I will definitely come again and eat something from their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Hainanese chicken - OMG good, tender chicken (dark meat), the rice was to die for.  Well worth every carb count.  

Vermicelli with cuttlefish ball - very flavorful winter melon soup.  cuttlefish ball has bits of cuttlefish in it that is chewy and tasty."}
{"text":"Visited here for breakfast with my wife.  We ordered the Teriyaki chicken breakfast plate and grilled pork with Udon noodles and French Toast.

Little bit pricey for breakfast our bill came close to $30.00 CAD before taxes.  We were full when we left.

Would go back for the Teriyaki chicken breakfast dish...skip the grilled pork with udon noodles (wife found the broth salty to her tastebuds).  French toast is worth a repeat.

Not sure if would go back for a lunch order or a dinner order.  Their prices are a bit steep for our budget.  

Service kinda slow..the staff is friendly..but we did hit the language barrier on our visit, our server had to call for help due to her poor english verbal skills.

For yelp reviewed places..we try..keyword is \"try\" to visit the restos that have a $ rating..friendlier on our wallets.  On occasion we do hit up $$ rated restos."}
{"text":"This place is always overly crowded for some weird reason.  I've been here a few times only because there isn't much around here for lunch so we sometimes default to this place if we want some HK cafe food.  However the food isn't really that special or that good for that matter.  I'm guessing the place is crowded because of convenience and the food comes quick.  Given the choice, there are other better and less expensive HK style cafes out there."}
{"text":"This five-star rating is exclusively for their HK-style tea - simply the best I've had time and time again."}
{"text":"I usually come to this HK style cafe when I want a quick bite of something savoury and that's not quite completely Chinese or western. I've had a number of hits here in the past, which is why I keep coming back, eternally trying to hunt for more...but ive also had a number of misses. Today was half and half. I ordered the porkchop with tomato sauce casserole and the Malaysian curry beef brisket. 

Straight up, the curry is always good. No matter how many times I've ordered it, it always satisfies me and leaves me wanting more. 

The casserole was the semi-fail today. Pretty average in taste: the porkchop was kind of soggy from being doused in the less than spectacular one dimensional tomato sauce and the fried rice underneath was bland and dry. 

But... the service and food delivery never fails to be speedy, so I tend to forgive their food transgressions."}
{"text":"This location of the HK chain offers the same menu as the location on woodbine but I find some of the menu items to be not as savoury. We ordered the club sandwich with beef, the HK breakfast waffle and the beef brisket noodle.

Club sandwich: (4.5/5) very delicious take on the classic club, but with the substitution of bacon with ham, and the addition of a medium thick slice of tender beef and egg, which elevates this Sammie to perfection. Despite being jam packed with ingredients it still manages to taste light and somewhat healthy

HK waffle: (3/5)  two small round waffles drizzled in two types of sweet sauce ( I think one was condensed milk) which made it taste more like a dessert than a breakfast entree. It was tasty but I would definitely not order this again unless im craving a sugar rush. 

Beef brisket noodle: (3/5) not like your regular beef noodle soup. While most tend to have a strong beef broth base, this broth was a bit on the sweet side. Coupled with the chunks of carrots in the soup, the broth ended up being more sweet than savoury in my books and  isn't how I would normally like to enjoy this dish. There were big pieces of tender beef brisket however, which redeemed the dish slightly."}
{"text":"My goodness has Phoenix finally jumped the shark! I've been coming to this location since they first opened, and the service and food quality have both remarkably gone downhill, most notably since they have expanded. 

Ordered a Mixed Grill Dinner Set ($22) which supposedly included King Prawn, Scallop, Chicken Breast, Steak, with soup, croissant, escargots, rice/spaghetti, and dessert.

First problem: dishes were served, but where were my escargots? Flagged down a waitress, and she pointed to the croissant and said \"that's the 'escargot'! Oh it's just an escargot-shaped bun, not literally real escargots haha!\" Dafuq??? Are you new here, or you think I was? There were definitely escargots with the dinners sets in the past, and still indicated so on the current menu (thank you camera). Since she was clealy useless, I talked to another waiter, who proceeded to explain ooh we don't do escargots anymore, we have replaced it with the potato salad, which you've just eaten! Dafuq #2??? Look, you can revise the menu, but you need to 1) indicate it on the actual menu, or 2) notify the patrons when they order, so they can make an informed decision. Lying and making excuses are unacceptable.

Second problem: Dude, that tiny and miserably thin slice of beef is not a \"steak\". There are food courts which serve better steak in a Mixed Grill set.

Redeeming quality: There were some remnants of fish slices in the soup, so it was not totally bland.

They ended up charging $20 instead of $22 for this, but still not worth it. In the past I'd gladly get one of these Dinner Sets once in a while; not now, not in this sorry state of affairs.

Oh, Third problem: they missed serving my dessert. Granted I was no longer in any mood for dessert, but do we really have to remind them of everything?

These guys are simply coasting on their past glory. I'd only get the Hainan Chicken if I were forced at gun point to come here. For other HK-style food, there are so many new options in Markham, there are no reasons to come to Phoenix anymore."}
{"text":"When I am craving some stir fry beef noodle or HK milk tea, this is the place that I go to. Even though their menu prices have been increasing in the last couple of years, I still come and enjoy my meal.

I'll talk about my past experiences here as I have frequently come often for lunch and afternoon tea. I've only been here once for dinner.

As for cell reception, for some reason, the back half of the restaurant is like a dead zone as I couldn't get strong cellular and data reception. I don't know if it is just my phone or provider, but signal is weak at the back half.

For lunch, they have their all day combos and lunch combos which comes with a drink. Of course, if you want to have a cold drink, you have to add extra money on top. They are quite busy during the lunch hours.

My favourite dishes for lunch are: 
-Fish filet with corn cream sauce on spaghetti/rice, 
-stir fry noodle with beef, 
-stir fry instant noodle with beef and 
-chicken cutlet on rice with a fried egg and tomato sauce.

They have a great variety of dishes to choose from. Some dishes are obviously better than others. I found that the spaghetti with beef and tomato sauce a bit bland and the tomato sauce tasted like really artificial. 

My favourite dishes for afternoon tea are:
-deep fried chicken leg with salad
-deep fried chicken wings with salad
-french toast with syrup

Again, their afternoon tea prices are awesome and I highly recommend you come here for afternoon tea.

As for dinner, I thought the dinner specials are a bit pricey. I tried the set dinner and it was strange enough that all the dishes came out at once. So I was drinking my soup while my main dish was sitting there and getting cold. I think the quality and quantity for that price point is not worth it for me.

Overall, I definitely recommend coming for lunch or afternoon tea. I am definitely a fan of this place and my family is too!"}
{"text":"Service is really bad here. Took a really long time to get our food and water. Food was very bland and when you ask the waitress for lemon she would say NO because you didn't purchase any Lemon tea. So ridiculous! I have never had any restaurant establishments force me to buy a drink in order to get a slice of lemon. Don't  order their  ginger tea...no ginger taste to it. I will never come here again. Nothing special and you can get better customer service elsewhere."}
{"text":"Phoenix is a great place for Chinese food as it offer a huge variety of items.  The menu have a lot of pictures so you can always find something you like.  Service is fast and servers are attentive.  The portion here is a little smaller than other Chinese diners but the quality is better.  They offer soup noodles, variety of baked rice I haven't seen at other places, curries, etc.  They also surprisingly have a variety of cool dessert options as well such as ice cream crepes and toast.  Too bad I am always too full to try them.  I will come here next time just to try their dessert.

Service: 4/5

Parking: 3/5"}
{"text":"One of my go to places, especially later in the evenings. The hours are good. The 10 steak special is great, sometimes I have two of them! with a cold hong kong tea of course. The set lobster meal with soup, escargot, muscles, the fried lobster (I usually get spaghetti as a side) and then an ice cream for desert is great for $22.00!

The decor is the typical tacky 80s Asian restaurant, and is in need of updating, but not at the cost of them raising prices.

The waffle desserts are also worth trying."}
{"text":"I'll rate each dish we had

Oat fried chicken: this dish was delicious, crispy outside, juicy and tender inside. Served with bonito flakes, mayo and teriyaki

Spicy brisket with veggies and noodle: very oily and heavy, but also very flavorful

Napoleon ice cream dessert: looks bigger than it actually is because of the puff pastry and whipped cream. It was pretty good but overpriced. I don't think we'd order it again for 8.50.

This place gets extremely busy during lunch and dinner, and you might have to wait in line for a while. The service was also slow because of how many people there were. Some line cooks or dishwashers had to come out and serve because there weren't enough servers. They were all friendly, but slow because it was very busy."}
{"text":"Comida rapida, calidad normal para ser comida rapida de cafetin, precio relativamente concordado con la calidad y la  rapidez, se ve limpio el restaurant, solo que el baño esta muy resbaloso. No le dan wifi a
Los clientes. Deberian mejorar la calidad de atencion al cliente, ya que ay mesonera que no entienden, hay que decirle 5 veces lo mismo para q pueda tomarte el pedido de la comida"}
{"text":"I heard from others that the service here is pretty bad but my first visit there seemed to prove otherwise.  While the service wasn't great, it didn't seem any worse than your typical Chinese restaurant.  I ordered the fish tofu noodle soup ($5.95), supposedly of a shark's fin pork bone based broth.  I was hesitant at first since I generally don't like anything made with pork.  It turned out ok because the broth tasted (and smelled) only mildly of pork, but the shark's fin taste was not there either.  The noodles were rather good (chewy texture, not too soggy).  I also shared an order of the HK-style egg sandwich with a friend.  It was pretty good - fluffy crustless white bread and fluffy scrambled egg.  I was told that it's a little expensive as far as HK style tea cafe restaurants go but it still seems reasonable (for someone from Orange County, California, at least).  Would definitely come back again if I have the chance."}
{"text":"Been here a few times to get some food. It's an ok place to eat occassionally and their prices might be a bit more expensive than some other asian/chinese cafes/restaurants but its bearable. Maybe a couple dollars more? They do offer some combos but that only really means you get a hot drink along with your meal. Getting a cold drink means an additional fee of 50 cents or so.

Food quality is actually not bad. I've tried their baked clams, cheese and mushroom rice/spaghetti dish which was quite good and tasty. I've also had a few of their Yunnan Vermicelli varieties like the shredded pork with preserved vegetables, fish fillet in fish broth and fish fillet in spicy fish broth; all of which I found quite tasty as well. The serving size is a good portion too so it definitely fills!

Serivce has been decent so far but I prefer coming during the day time because the servers seem to care more. Well, they were females...no offense guys! When I came during the day for either take out or eating in, service was fine. I came one time in the evening and was served by a guy who forgot to give me a menu. I also got the vibe that they didn't want me there as they were going to be closed in an HOUR...you really can't take one more customer? And I finished eating in HALF AN HOUR TOO! I'm not that inconsiderate now ;P

In any case overall it's not a bad place to grab a bite if you are in the area. Would I say it's the greatest? No...the worst? Nah. There's nothing super special about this place but it's not so bad that you need to avoid it. :)"}
{"text":"Great food. I got the pad thai and fried rice and it was absolutely delicious. I would skip the desserts though, they may be very pretty, however they're pretty plain. Even though it was busy (went on family day) the staff did a good job of regularly checking in on us, and we got our food very quickly. The prices are good for the quality they provide."}
{"text":"HK cafes are my go tos! For breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea or dinner. This place was OKAY. I tried their Hainan chicken which i suppose is their specialty. Chicken was tender and had spices that went well with it. The soup however, was bland and contained a good amount of MSG. Price is a little bit above average compared to most HK style cafes. Lunch time was really busy on the Friday. Would I try this place again? Maybe not. Nothing too special about this place."}
{"text":"Been eating here a lot over the years, regular Chinese food, regular service but today was awful. Even stopped us when retrieving the bill and asked us for more tips. Do you deserve 20% tips? you want us to put down another nickel? Ridiculous. You have lost a long time customer, service quality going down over the years at bayview location. McCowan store is much better."}
{"text":"Been going here for the last couple years.  I can always count on consistent service and food quality.  One of my favourite quick bite spot.

They turn table pretty fast so we never have to wait for long."}
{"text":"Phoenix Restaurant does not look like much from the outside, but it is pretty modern in a sort of elegant way on the inside particularly modern, and with a surprisingly comfortable atmosphere.

Food is quite good. My hands-down favorite and the restaurant's popular dish is the Hainanese Chicken W/ Chicken Oil Rice, their Fried Chicken Wing is juicy good,serve hot straight out of the deep fryer, and their Hong Kong ice tea is pretty good.

The restaurant is clean, service is fast and attentive, and it is a popular place."}
{"text":"Popped in here real quick as its very close to my gym. The place was packed on the weekend and isn't very big but we were seated fairly quickly. 

Staff is friendlier than most Asian establishments but there was a quick rush to remove our plates once we were done (perhaps not enough dishes out back?) 

Only down side is that there isn't very much on the vegetarian side of things to order so I opted for dessert (yes I waned dessert at 10am so judge me!) but the flaky heavenly picture I pointed at was not available on days that it's really busy because it takes too long to make (per my waitress). 

Gutted, I settled for the condensed Milk waffle and a coffee and I can't say I had any complaints for $5 - well maybe that the waffle size was a wee bit on the small side and for that it remains undecided if I shall return."}
{"text":"food is not bad, service is really crappy. they got my order wrong and gave me attitude when i told them about it"}
{"text":"A regular dinner spot for me and family, casual \"HK diner\" style with a slightly larger selection of dessert snacks. A recent visit I ordered the Hong Kong style \"waffles\" with mango ice cream - a fairly new dessert menu item. It was good for a quick fix but don't get it too late on a weeknight - the waffles will be pre-made, hard, and cold. For the price and convenience (after dinner! Right along my usual routine) it's alright, but nothing to rave about. In past visits I've also had their panna cotta - again, for the convenience and price it's acceptable.

They have great deals on meal combos featuring a main and a hot drink - your typical Hong Kong style selection of milk tea, coffee (don't...trust me), yin yang, lemon tea...overall a safe place for quick and easy \"Hong Kong\" style food. I would recommend their noodles with fish soup for something filling, simple, and not oily."}
{"text":"Your typical Hong Kong diner style restaurant. Portions are very large. Prices are slightly more expensive then most of their competitors. Very consistent every visit clean plating, typical Asian service and atmosphere is dependent on who sits near you. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"having moved here from Vancouver where restaurants like this existed everywhere and u could drive no more than 10 minutes to get to a local fav, to Toronto...where hk cafes are located mostly and only further away in the city. I was in search for my fav baked pork chop on rice, lead me to Yelp

arrived 30 min before closing, was greeted and seated by the friendly staff. order did show up as the wrong item but they gladly took it back and remade my order. I had the baked pork chop with tomato and cream sauce. was good, definitely not as good as what I am used to in Vancouver

I would definitely come back to try other items as the menu is quite extensive, just kinda far from downtown!"}

I don't get why HK people love this restaurant so much? I had a pasta dish with a buttery croissant and it was not good.

{"text":"Hainan chicken with rice.  That's it.  Deboned, full of flavour, nice silky texture.  

I was reminded by our good friend the last time I ordered something else I regretted it and forced my husband to share his chicken with me.  Rarely do we ever order the same item but here, it's a given.  

No regrets from now on!"}
{"text":"If I could write a review that consisted of only 5 words this would be it:
Order Hainan chicken and rice.
I don't fancy HK cafe food.  It does nothing for me.  However, the Hainan chicken here is always so tasty and the rice is very flavourful."}
{"text":"Although on the pricier side for HK style cafe, Phoenix used to be worth it for the food quality. Now all the prices have increased and quality is going down. With so many other similar options in the area, I wouldn't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Phoenix is a solid Hk cafe and restaurant.

I find that their menu is a bit different and has a bit more interesting options than most Hk cafe. This place started off as an independent establishment and grew into a I believe a second restaurant and possibly third.

They have a very good selection of Hk diner food including some fusion items including touching on korean and Japanese flavours.

I normally order the hainanese chicken with rice or the Malaysian fried rice (very spicy) but overall I do like eating here. I like this location better than the one on steeles and woodbine."}
{"text":"Hong Kong style food. Expensive for average quality of food. There are definitely cheaper options out there. That being said, quality is solid and consistent. Service is okay."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch take out today at Phoenix. The order was placed at 12:33PM and I waited at the restaurant (standing RIGHT BY the take out area). At 1:05PM, I approached the cashier asking for a refund and to cancel the order, the cashier then quickly turned around and started packing my lunch - which means my order was just sitting there! I complained that I stood there for over 30 min and the response I received was, \"I am sorry. We are really busy today.\" Had I not approached them, I don't know how long I would have waited! Because the order was packed in such a hurry, the cutlery and napkins that I had asked for when the order was placed were missed.

This service was completely unacceptable. I understand that noon time is usually busy, but a simple sorry and a somewhat cold meal does not make me feel whole."}
{"text":"Many years ago, it used to be great. And then it got popular. Then it was about cutting portions, and stressing staff. I have never had to wait so long for a waiter / waitress to take my money. Other then that, the food is decent. If the service part stepped up a little bit, it would be better.

MY BIGGEST TIP: DO NOT GO ON A WEEKEND. You don't get seated unless you're a door crasher (exaggerating)"}
{"text":"One of the best Hong Kong style cafes in Toronto. Their noodles in soup comes with fish broth, it's not common when you go to other HK style cafes (usually use chicken broth). Fish broth is how it should be. 

I usually come here for lunch and I order lunch combos (comes with a drink, add a dollar for a cold drink). Very decent place."}
{"text":"I often go to Pheonix Restaurant for lunch and sometimes for afternoon snacks. Their afternoon snacks menu is pretty good, and the choice selection is plentiful. However, their dinner serving isn't quite on par as what I would hope.

I came here for dinner one night and ordered steak fried udon. Knowing that steak is not necessarily the best pair with fried udon, I decided to give it a try. First, I think the combination was not the greatest. The steak was placed on top of the udon which makes eating the udon very difficult. Second, the toughness in steak forms a tremendous contrast with the softness of the fried udon - again, the food experience was weird. My opinion on this kind of food may not be representative from everyone else. All in all, at the end of the day, I don't think I finished the dish.

However, if you like to experience steak fried udon, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Really good asian comfort food.  They have a large menu and service is always fast and efficient.  I usually get the hainan chicken rice or the baked tomato pork chop on spaghetti.  Both are very tasty.  The rice always leaves me very thirsty for a few hours afterward so maybe they put some msg in that broth?  Parking can sometimes be an issue especially weekends during peak hours."}
{"text":"Have been here for several times, with friends, family. Place is good,  very organized. Service is perfect and friendly. Food is also great. Had to order Hainan Chicken Rice as my favorite dish. The only improvement they have to make is the method of payment, it will be great if you could pay with Credit Cards, Debet instead of CASH."}
{"text":"Came here for HK-style breakfast and I got exactly what I wanted. Typical HK bistro, fast and no-frills. No smiles no small talk, how many people, bring you there, wipe the table, get you seated, come back in 5 min, you order, you eat, get the bill, get out. It's really an in-and-out restaurant. 

The place is relatively large and modern decor. Since the service is pretty fast you usually don't have to wait long. Ordered the chicken steak with instant noodles. The food was as expected nothing amazing. Good chicken and noodles, msg soup. Good price. The milk tea was not strong enough for me. I prefer stronger. The have a good variety of breakfast combo that comes with a drink of your choice of HK milk tea, coffee, lemon water or lemon tea.

Finished eating and got out of there quickly. Decent HK style food."}
{"text":"Food is okay, but I would like to complain the male clerk at register. He always shows you the long face, and attitude is bad."}
{"text":"Our group of 18 was actually first at their other location on Woodbine.  It being the Sunday lunch hour, it wasn't much of a stretch of the imagination that they wouldn't have room for us!  A quick thinking member of our group got the Woodbine location to call this location to see if they had room for our unruly crew.  As luck would have it, they did and off went our little car-cade up north.

The table was ready for us right away.  Imagine!  There was a line up of regulars who didn't call ahead and must have thought that their time has come for a seat, when our group strolled in and claimed the tables dead in the centre of the restaurant all to ourselves.  The envy!

The food... very delicious almost Hong Kong Cafe style food, but not quite.  The red curry chicken chop on rice was ok... nothing special really.  It didn't have any greens other than onions, but it will satisfy any cravings for HK style chicken chops.  I had their well-known special of noodles in fish broth with super soft fish balls, tofu and winter melon.  Not much to look at, but oh, so good!  It's very different from most of the other items on their menu.  They are also known for their Hai Nan Chicken Rice.

To finish off, we had a surprise dessert for the birthday girl.  The Napoleon confection with puff pastry, strawberries, cream and a gigantic dollop of black sesame ice cream was well worth it for the visual excitement alone.

Cash only, surprisingly less busy (though there were still steady line ups the entire time we were there) than other Chinese places of this caliber probably due to their far off location in a strip plaza.  A good worthwhile place to try out."}
{"text":"I didn't't even get a chance to sit down.... no credit cards and a minimum amount  is 10$s for debit cards

Walked in @ 2:30pm made me wait for a few minutes and told me the bad the news.

Too bad. Your right across the road from a major hotel. Hmmmm business travelers. Missing out on business."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and the prices are actually a lot higher than other places. I decided to give it a try anyways but the service was not that good and their hk tea disappointed me. I think they switched to a cheaper milk which gave it a really bad after taste. The food is okay but totally not worth the price."}
{"text":"Service: 2/5
There nothing much to expect from this restaurant. If you go to a Chinese restaurant and expect quality service then you are in the wrong place my friend ;) Come for the food, not the service!

Food: 4/5
I would come here for their Haianese Chicken all day if I can. It is quiet expensive to get chicken only $15. For the Chicken and rice, it is about $10. Aside from this, I would get their baked items or BBQ pork and rice. This is a cheap place for a quick brunch with your coworkers or friends. 

TIPS: Bring cash, this place does not do split bills and doesn't take debit under 10$"}
{"text":"2.5/5 stars. 
There are definitely better hk style restaurants so keep looking, you probably have better choices than this place...

We ordered fried rice noodle with beef in soya sauce and baked fish filet and spaghetti with corn cream sauce. The first dish was decent, but not the best. The baked fish was really salty, which overpowered the taste of the dish so all you could taste was the saltiness. 

The price was a little excessive for such mediocre dishes. What was frustrating was that some drinks aren't included with dishes, but the server asked us what we wanted to drink almost implying that they WERE included. We simply ordered hot lemon water, so when we bill came they charged us $2 for each lemon water. Kinda ridiculous considering a lemon water should at most be worth 99 cents!!! Not usually the one to obsess over this petty stuff but the waiter could have told us at least."}
{"text":"Had the bubble waffle. Came here with a friend, we had to only wait about 5 minutes for a seat. We were placed in a booth near the front. We were advised in advance that the waffles would take about 10 minutes before it can be served. The waffles are large, and you get a scoop of ice cream with it. The prices are quite reasonable and the servers check up on you to see if you're satisfied. Quite worth the price."}
{"text":"My family and I have been patrons of this place for countless years now, coming in several times a week. Throughout the years there have been many changes, both good and not-so-good, but they've still managed to keep the charm of a modern, wide-offering Hong Kong-nese cafe. 

The food quality itself is excellent and fairly consistent, though they've significantly cut down on their portions over the years - pork chops and fish cutlets are around 60% the size they used to be ten years ago. Price-wise, they're definitely on the upper-end of price ranges as far as Hong Kong cafes go, but my undying loyalty to them keeps me coming back every week. I swear they put something addictive in their Hainan Chicken and Teriyaki Sauce Fried Pork Cutlet Rice. If you're looking for late-night dessert options, they've also got nice variations on the Hong Kong egg waffles (with ice cream and whipped cream).

Service is, as you can and would expect, Hong Kong-nese. Though their waitresses are from a variety of regions, they're all fairly courteous but sometimes forgetful or misplace an order. Wouldn't be too good of a first impression for new customers, but I'm a 10-year guy at this place and just shake it off. The food quality helps me forget any errors. 

Don't expect a quick seating if you're coming for lunch - this place is PACKED! A small cafe located near several office parks and buildings means you're going to get their early, or take a late lunch."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. This place is very busy and I assume the attraction is the low prices. It certainly isn't the freshness of the food. It's fast food quality food with little to no nutritional value. Eggs, fried food, rice and noodles. Much of what they serve looks like processed food.  If you manage your expectations it is an ok place for a quick mediocre meal in a sit down environment.  Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"This place use to be close to my old house, we go there for the distance, the food there we never care for."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and ordered the steak and egg set. The bun was soft and fresh, which was really good but I found everything else to be mediocre at best. The steak was just the standard sliced beef that you would get in the stir fried noodle dish and the egg was just.. well, egg. The lack of vegetables was quite disappointing and it was the gross frozen peas, corn, and carrots assortment. The portion sizes were pretty large though so I was really really full from the meal. Decent price for the quantity of food."}
{"text":"The hainan chicken & rice is not as good as before.  The rice tasted like rock, seems like they put less water when making it . The good thing was boneless chicken but they used microwave to warm up the chicken."}
{"text":"Quick place to grab a bite if you are looking for hk cafe style food. Prices gone up a lot within the past yr & noted they are now opening a location in dt! I think it will be a great hit in dt location. Standard food. Really busy during lunch hr as many office buildings around. Also go to the location on mccowan often."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and surprisingly even the service here, however, the food made my stomach turn really bad even before I could finish."}
{"text":"Beyond average Hong Kong style cafe. Decent food quality and you can find nearly everything here. Great place for quick lunch/dessert. Service was pretty fast for most dishes."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite HK-style restaurants in Markham. Although their items can be a bit pricey, the food is actually really good and the portions are quite generous. My go-to drink here is the cold lemon tea because it always tastes perfect to me - not too sweet, not too lemony.

While similar restaurants might only have ten combos for their lunch/dinner specials, Phoenix has more than double! If you're still hungry after your meal, definitely try their desserts. Their desserts are plated well and taste really good. Most of the servers at Phoenix are really nice, too.

Try their Hainan chicken with rice or any curry rice dish! Honestly though, 99% of the things I've tried there were delicious. :)"}
{"text":"I've generally had good experiences at Phoenix; they have a diverse menu with enticing pictures of dessert options that always tug at my wallet.  As many have mentioned, the Hainan chicken with rice is a great choice.  I came yesterday with my parents, who ordered the Black Sesame Napoleon Ice Cream, (pictured) and judging from their facial expressions and them telling me \"this is good\", I surmised that that it was good.  I ordered the Honey BBQ Pork Collar & Egg on Rice, which also comes with a nice side of two cucumber slices.  I generally like this dish, but my only complaint is that the don't spread the sauce evenly throughout.  Parts of it are as dry as British humour, while other parts are basically sauce with a side of rice.  

I'll definitely come back and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a new spot.  It's a good place to chill and they've probably got something in their menu that'll satisfy your cravings."}
{"text":"I've tried several dishes on their menu over the past 2 years;  from noodles to waffles. 
Unfortunately,  I have been really disappointed with everything....EXCEPT the Hainanese Chicken Rice.

I honestly believe that dish is their saving grace. If they screw up on that....well, let's hope they don't."}
{"text":"I practically live here.  Only decent place in the area that serves hk style cafe dishes... Great selection of food and efficient/consistent service."}
{"text":"I've been on a quest for Singaporean Chicken Rice (aka Hoinam  aka Hainan Chicken).

Phoenix has been in my sight lines for a while now, but haven't had much time lately.  But over the holidays I happened to be in the neighourhood running some errands, and decided to pull in going solo.

It was an ominous start as a lady who was behind me decided to barge by me while I was approaching the hostess desk at the last second to leave her name.   I was equally pissed that the hostess saw this move and decided to do nothing.  They had a table for this lady and her party of 2 and I had to wait.  It was the Christmas holidays, I decided to let it pass and not make a scene.  

15 minutes later seeing another table of 2 go through, I stepped up and said I'd been here for a while now.  And wouldn't you know it, they \"found\" me a spot right away.

Saw the menu, but I came for the Chicken Rice.  

After some more crappy service, I finally got it served.  It was underwhelming to say the least.   The texture just isn't as silky smooth and slick like great Chicken Rice should be.  The ginger sauce was fairly bland, and this was just plain rice.  I expect Chicken rice rice, to have been made with the broth the chicken is made from and explode with flavour.  

This was like going on a date that a friend had been hyping.  \"She may not be the hottest thing, but very cute with a good personality\", however when you meet her you realize she's way older and about 20 pounds heavier than you expected.  And her personality?  Just rude."}
{"text":"I have been to countless HK cafes all around the GTA and even in Asia. This place is my favourite HK cafe in the GTA!  

At Phoenix, aka ????, their wide selection of food, great prices and decent atmosphere makes me a loyal customer! Have you seen some of the HK cafes in Markham? Just by looking at its appearances outside, I refuse to go in despite all of the positive raves among friends! Even those ones I gave it a try still does not beat quality of Phoenix's food for that price.

Yes, not all the staff can speak English that well, but their food is amazing - Hainan style chicken, pork cutlet and sweet pork neck meat/egg on rice especially. You can order meals that come with a hot drink (coffee, tea, honey lemon, or lemon water). You have to add little more money if you want a cold beverage for the selections above, or pay difference if you wanted a different drink. Nothing unusual, and fairly typical of a HK cafe.

They even have waffles and crepes at this place! This place has everything! I have had better panna cottas, but this place isn't the worst.

I have been this location (Steeles & Woodbine) as well as the one near hwy 7 & Bayview and McCowan & hwy 7/16th. They have the same, excellent quality! I was surprised. All plazas they're in have limited parking spaces, so you may find it difficult to find a spot. Make sure to go early as it can be extremely busy during meal time. If I go at 11:30am, there isn't much of a wait. At 12 or later, I have to wait for at least half an hour I would say. But they move fairly quick and the food comes fast as well. In the end, they sometimes give you a 10% off for next time's use (with an expiry date)."}
{"text":"Probably the most disgusting Chinese comfort food restaurant. I came into order a pineapple bun with butter and a coffee. Paid $5.00 for it when I could've gotten it for 2.50 but I guess they say you pay for convenience. She said I hate to wait 10 minutes for it to be ready. Really 10 minutes to prep for a bun that's already been made and to put butter in it? Uhhh okay. Not only that, as I was waiting at the back, they had their waitresses making tea and putting their fingers in the cup. Seriously? You just cleared other peoples dirty dishes and you put your fingers in peoples tea cups? That's really sanitary! I am never coming back. Yeah its good if you're sitting down and eating fast food comfort food...but the shit I saw yesterday, not cool ."}
{"text":"The food here is good but I would say it is overpriced. I've been to many Hong Kong style restaurants in Markham and downtown and they are the same quality and much cheaper. I give five stars for the food quality - great - but one star off for the prices."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch hour, and was seated quickly.

Ordered from their lunch menu that comes with a drink.
Food came fast
Ordered the baked chicken spaghetti and cheese with cream sauce and the chicken steak and pork chop with gravy sauce on rice.

The baked chicken spaghetti and cheese with cream sauce had very little cheese, all cream sauce. Taste wasn't there but good portion size
The chicken steak and pork chop with gravy sauce on rice was ok 

Silky HK milk tea, though it wasn't hot like I was use to"}
{"text":"Wow I come here way too often than I should. They used to have 20% off your next dine in within 2 weeks. I guess people were abusing it and they stopped having that promotion. I absolutely love coming here, I'm that person that will order the same thing for the next 3 years. YUP. That's exactly it. Not lying. I've been getting the instant noodle with fried egg and sausages for the past 2 years. Occasionally I will venture out and get a plate of fried rice, but I would say 9 out of 10 times, I will get my beloved instant noodles.. and yeshhhhhhhhhhhhh I know it's bad for me. But they are really good! 

My husband always ordered the fried egg/tomato rice with fried pork chop, which is also really good. 

Service is fast, and the staff friendless? Well, it's a typical chinese resturant, don't expect too much."}
{"text":"My go to place for bfast n lunch. They are always busy during lunch time, beware. My fav is their maggie pork chop lunch combo that comes w drink for less than $10. The staffs are swift and food comes fast"}
{"text":"We go here about twice a month and enjoy the casual atmosphere with good food.  Portion sizes are good and they have a lot of combos that comes with drinks.  One of my favour is the Malaysian curry - you can order it as a entree for a little more $ and the portion is a lot bigger than if you were to order it with the rice.  The naan bread is FANTASTIC, we order extra ones just to eat, butterly though but good!"}
{"text":"Their hainan chicken rice is to die for. The chicken is so moist and the rice tastes pretty good on its own. Curry is good too, has a milky taste. Desserts are cheap but fancy in a way theres waffles, crepes and panna cotas to indulge in. 

Took a while for the food to come though and had to ask for knives and tissues. Pretty spacious restaurant with a modern design; clean and sleek. I would come here again but nothing blew my mind."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and it is always pretty good. 

I usually get the Hainan chicken rice for around $9. It is a huge portion with a bowl of  soup included. My dad got the beef brisket curry. The curry is an orange ish colour, it is more sweet, and a little bit spicy. So delicious with the rice. 

We also got dessert. They were out of crepes which was upsetting but we still got the sesame ice cream waffle. It came with 4 toaster size waffles with a giant scoop of sesame ice cream topped with whipped cream and chocolate syrup. The waffle was crispy and fresh. It went really well with the ice cream! 

Service was pretty attentive and friendly. We got a 15% off coupon for the next time we dine; valid at any of the 3 locations. Overall, this place is worth a try as it has an extensive menu of good quality dishes."}
{"text":"Wanted to try somewhere else and different than Western breakfast and Phoenix Restaurant was close by, serving Hong Kong style breakfast... So why not?

Though I am not a fan of Hong Kong style breakfasts, having a change from Western one lead me to Phoenix Restaurant.

Located in Bridlewood Mall, on the lower level, Phoenix Restaurant was the only thing besides Metro that was opened that early... in that corner anyways.

Waitress attended and spoke in Cantonese, showed the way towards the booths, which was pretty comfy and nice. It wasn't too busy yet, which was the perfect atmosphere for me.

Their breakfast menu was only of one page. Serving from sandwiches, bread and toast, noodles, buns, and even have options of pork chops and steak!

Each breakfast set comes with an option of hot HK tea, coffee or lemon tea. If you wish to switch the lemon tea to iced, it'll be a $1.25 extra -- which to me is just a rip off. Plus, it was raining that morning so I don't mind having hot lemon tea.

Breakfast came quick and service was efficient.

I got the super basic HK breakfast (breakfast set M), which consisted of eggs, luncheon meat and instant noodles!
The meat options were bacon, ham or sausage and the other noodle choice was udon noodles.

On the side, they had condiments.. and my all time favourite, you guessed it?! Chili oil!! Which made my meal more enjoyable.

The meal was okay, nothing special. Also felt like my lemon tea could lose a lemon, as I had 3 slices of lemon in there! The lemon flavour was slightly strong for me.

Technically speaking, I could have made that meal by myself at home for cheaper as it cost $6 +tax. But it was still alright as I got to try this place out and had a HK style meal after a long time!

If I have time, I would like to try out their lunch and dinner menu as it would probably have more options than the breakfast one."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for food. The food is pretty good for a HK cafe. I don't usually go to Phoenix because I just don't pass by enough to merit a visit. However, when the fiance says yes, then it's a yes.. lol. Came here for breakfast and they had a pretty big selection! I obviously had the eggs combo with pancakes! Noms.. I will give it 4 stars because this visit was very pleasing. The next time I go during lunch/dinner time, I'll update the review with pics.

-1 star for service because it was so slow. Had to flag 3 different waitresses to get the bill.. so sad :("}
{"text":"This place used to be decent but recently the food has gone downhill and the service is atrocious. The last time I went, we arrived at 10.40am, so my friend and I ordered a sandwich off the breakfast menu to share. As the lunch menu starts at 11am, we then ordered 2 lunch combos. We waited and waited. At 11.40am, I asked where our lunches? As other people that arrived after us, were getting their lunches. The waitress checks up and returns to tell us that we didn't order nothing. I told her that we did and she just says, no you didn't. She didn't apologise and say sorry, I'll take your order again. I would have just re-ordered, but she insisted that we only ordered the breakfast, to share and nothing else. So we just got up, paid and left. If I was paying, I would not have left a tip but my friend left $1.  
Food is pricy, not that great (used to be way better), bad for parking and lousy service. 
I'm never returning here again."}
{"text":"What more can I say.  HK style fast food.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner time is always pack with people.  Food taste and quality is pretty consistent. Wish they have more parking. Btw, the waitstaff don't get to keep their tips! That's why service is so so."}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday night at 8pm. Dinner rush is over and restaurant wasn't very busy, with half of the restaurant occupied. Restaurant is in a small strip mall and looks to be the only restaurant/eatery here. Since other businesses were closed, the area is super quiet and there's plenty of parking spots.

The Hainanese chicken rice sounded like a must try according to other Yelpers so I ordered that. Husband also ordered baked chicken rice with white sauce and walnuts.

The baked rice is your average dish from any Cha Chan Tang. The sauce wasn't too heavy tasting which is good. I wouldn't mind if they put more sauce though.

This rice was part of a meal that included drink and we got hot yin yeung, which was quite good and smooth.

The Hainanese chicken rice is definitely quite good. The best I've come across in Toronto so far. Chicken is extremely tender, smooth, flavorful and the portion was fair. I love that the bones have been removed. The soup and rice is quite tasty too. Well deserved reputation for this dish.


The menu book is really big, like any Cha Chan Tang I suppose. Took me a while to go through and decide :) List of options from breakfast, lunch, tea time and dinner and combos and desserts, all in this one big book. Good thing there are lots of pictures to help.

Servers were mostly young kids in their late teen, early 20s and did their job putting the food on the table, but didn't show much enthusiasm or provide warm friendly service to customers e.g. make eye contact, smile, take your order in a cheerful tone. Just noticed this from observing how other customers were serviced nearby. I got who I believe could be a supervisor or manager to take my order and her tone was better. But I know, I'm eating at a Cha Chan Tang so as long as my food comes right and quick and the servers are not rude, then I'm satisfied :)

I also got seated around the corner from where they dump the dirty dishes in the back and hearing loud dishes crashing into bins while dining was a bit distracting. 

The restaurant had 2 big TV screens on the opposite end of the walls but seem like they only used it to showcase pictures of their dishes. Would be nice to show something more entertaining :)

Overall, I would come back to try the other items in their big big menu :)


Forgot to mention, they've written 10% off at the bottom of the receipt, ripped it off and told me that I would get that discount next time if I show that stub. I assume every table got the same offer."}
{"text":"My family decided to make another trip to Phoenix Restaurant for a quick lunch in our busy schedule.  We were expecting a delicious, fast, and flavourful lunch from this place and we were not disappointed. 

The Szechuan Beef Brisket with Green Beans on Rice was honestly one of the best combinations of flavours I have encountered in a while. There was the a right amount spice, saltiness, and sweetness in every bite I had taken. The sauce was prepared very nicely as it complimented the beef brisket with harmony. 

The Malaysian Curry Chicken on Rice was a small disappointment as the chicken was overcooked and dry , while the portion of the plate was very small in our expectation, as my family of 3 finished the plate in not time flat. 

The Porkchop on Bun was done decently as the only thing I was not to fond of was the amount of sauce inside the sandwich as it was dripping onto my hands as I was eating it. The cook on the porkchop was done nicely to a perfect temperature which made up for the excessive use of sauce. 

Overall, I had to downgrade my rating just a bit as the food was average, as there was no consistency among all three dishes my family had ordered."}
{"text":"Phoenix Restaurant is a typical Hong Kong style restaurant that is frequented by a lot of people in the Markham area. So, I decided to check the restaurant with a few friends. There is a vast selection of food to choose from ranging from breakfast to lunch to tea break to dinner. 

The decor is the restaurant is a bit hipster with some vibrant colours in the background. It was very pleasant to see more of a modern take on a restaurant that serves very simple dishes.  

The food is very typical of what you would expect form a Hong Kong style restaurant. They take classic and home style dishes and give them a new life in which the presentation is flawless. I have not seen amazing and clean presentation of Hong Kong style dishes in a very long time. The dishes were freshly prepared and arrived in an efficient time. The drinks were a bit on the downside though since the cold Hong Kong style milk tea my friend and I had ordered was probably the worst I have drank in my life. Overall, the food is amazing and I have heard a lot of appraisal for their Hainan Chicken on Rice, which I hope I can feast on in the future. 

The service was decent, the waiters were very attentive whenever we wanted more tea and when we were ready to pay for the bill since my Cantonese still needs some work. 

Overall, if you want more of an upclass experience in Hong Kong style cuisine, then Phoenix Restaurant is the place to go."}
{"text":"Prices increased by a whole $2-3 per dish. Even the cheaper bang for buck dishes that one would come here for. Taste was just okay and the portions were reduced.

Would come back if around the area due to convenience and not by choice. Service was a bit absent but typical. Maybe Pheonix needs to stop expanding so quickly to many locations?"}
{"text":"Had Malaysian curry beef from this place.  Curry was thick and tasted really good.  Wasn't watery at all.  

:Likes: Similar to other Phoenix's, this is HK style cafe with over 100 items/combos.  Food comes out fast.  Decent quality and tastes great

Dislikes: The ambiance of this place is terrible.  At the cash, there were cupboards hanging with the doors ripped off and only 1/2 painted.  Store seemed dirtier than other Phoenix\s too. No smiles from wait staff either.

Verdict: Great \"food\" place, but definitely definitely definitely not a formal place and don't take dates here unless you are trying break up with them and show you are cheap but still want to enjoy good food at the same time."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch before but most recently for breakfast. The food is good and at the standard you would expect but I think it's overpriced. Their breakfast menu ranged from $4-8, which I want expecting from a Western Hong Kong restaurant. There wasn't anything about the food that made it so spectacular, maybe they added some cut up veggie (probably from frozen) into my ham and macaroni. I do like the food and would come back for it but the prices are holding me back. My breakfast meal for two came up to $13 which is a bit more that what I'm use too. There are definitely places that are the same for cheap and some even better for cheaper."}
{"text":"Phoenix Restaurant is a cafe that I wasn't a big fan of years ago. I remember it being expensive and lacked variety but I went again recently and was impressed by the large selection and decent prices. I had their alfredo with a fluffy pastry at the top which added a great texture, their chicken wings are also freshly fried and very crispy. They also have a good dessert selection with waffles and sesame ice cream as my favourite.

{"text":"Although Phoenix is a bit pricier compared to many other Hong Kong-style cafes, at least the quality of their food lives up to its higher cost. 

I ordered the Pork Cutlet with Yunnan Noodles ($7.50), and it tasted delicious! I was super impressed with how thick the pieces of cutlet were. There's a lot of meat and not just all batter, although the deep fried batter was tasty as well! Dare I say it's quite comparable to Mr. Tonkatsu, except you're paying double the price there? 

I do wish I had asked them to put the cutlet on a separate dish apart from the noodles, so that they don't become soggy after a while of soaking in the noodles. Not like the pork adds any extra flavour to the noodles or soup base anyway. The noodles and soup are quite bland on its own, but I personally prefer that over a MSG-filled soup base. Plus, you can always add hot sauce if you want more flavour.

Will come back here (or another one of their locations) to try something else on their extensive menu!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Phoenix for a couple years now and they have multiple locations. This location specifically, is hands down the best for their Hainan chicken rice. I usually come for dinner as the location is close to home and Markville Mall. 

Value wise, it is a bit more pricey than their competition nearby (i.e. New City and Blue Ocean) as their combos do not include a soup while being at around the same price point which is rather disappointing. The desserts are also quite good which is something not all HK style cafes have. 

The plus side here is that the location is larger therefore wait times are not half as long as others around and food comes quick. Definitely a good option if you are short on time."}
{"text":"Eh. With all the options available in the area, I wouldn't bother. Maybe I didn't order the right things but I thought the food was very subpar. We had the Fish Fillet Baked Rice with Mushroom Sauce ($9.50) and one off the set lunch menu which was the Chicken Steak & Pork Chop w/ Gravy Sauce on Rice ($8.50) that comes with a drink. Both dishes were rather bland. The Mushroom Cream Sauce is essentially cream sauce with mushrooms as a topping. The fish fillet was good but the sauce wasn't as thick and creamy as I usually like it. As for the other dish, the gravy sauce had a tangy taste. Meat was good but the dish overall lacked depth. All in all, everything left more to be desired. 

One thing I really did like about the place was that it was very clean. Servers were also very friendly and efficient. They were accommodating and got us what we needed.  Menu has an extensive selection and a lot of variety. They have a breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner menus that are served at specific times. However, they are pretty inflexible with substitutions (i.e.: can't request cream sauce instead of gravy sauce) which in a sense, is fair. 

Relatively higher pricing and forgettable food so I wouldn't come back. Don't get me wrong, it really wasn't TERRIBLE but far from impressive. I just rather spend my money elsewhere especially when in Markham."}
{"text":"I come here often with my family for saturday lunches since it's at a really convenient location. I always get the baked chicken & ham spaghetti with cheese and egg. It's almost $10 but it's really fulfilling and I always end up returning ordering the same thing! Also, they usually have discounts throughout the year where you can get discounts for your next visit if you spend a specific amount of money.

I'm also a fan of their noodle soups and rices! Overall, their food is definitely reminiscent of some classic cafe food in HK and I feel the price for what you get is reasonable as the quality is definitely higher of other cafes around Markham. Their drinks and desserts are also great! Iced lemon tea is always a favourite of mine and all of their desserts are amazing - the dessert menu is really varied and they usually change it up with every season. 

Definitely a personal favourite restaurant of mine!"}
{"text":"I grew up on HK style cafe's and food, so each time I have it, it brings back memories.  Richmond Court brings back bad memories, while Phoenix brings back good memories.  

My date and I ordered a decent amount of food:

-Hainanese chicken with rice
-Pork chop cutlet w/teriyaki sauce and fried rice
-Baked escargot (8 pcs)
-7 up w/ vanilla ice cream
-Red bean and grass jelly drink.  

This came to just under $40 including tax and tip, so while not \"cheap\" by Chinese food standards, still a very good price.  

The Hainenese chicken was so meaty, tender, and just enough fat to make it very tasty.  The onion/ginger accompaniment was also very good. What I really liked was that even though it was just steamed rice, the rice had some chicken flavour to it.  Very nice touch.  Great deal for just over $8.  It's probably one of the best Hainenese chickens I've had (along with my mommy's and Perfect Chicken in Mississauga). So that's definitely a fiver.  

I also had a taste of my date's pork chop cutlet (fried).  The portion was huge.  It was two big ass cutlets with fried rice and some teriyaki sauce on the side.  The pork chop itself was very crispy, but you could still taste the meat.  This means these guys are using good cuts of pork and also know how to cook it properly.  The only downside is that the teriyaki sauce was a tad salty. 4.5/5

Baked escargot wasn't anything special, but tolerable. 2.5/5

As for the after-meal drinks, I liked my red bean/grass jelly drink, but my date didn't like hers. 3.5/5

Also, while people say the service isn't the best, I found it better than most places around the area.  The fact they actually spoke English, cleared our plates while we were eating (as opposed to waiting for it to all pile up) is a step up (go to Ocean where you basically fend for yourself).  This is an HK style cafe, so people shouldn't expect The Keg type service. I was happy that they served our meal within 10 minutes, spoke English (so I don't have to resort to my Canadianized Cantonese) and actually said \"Thanks for coming\" when we left.  

Verdict: Would I visit again? Absolutely.  3.75/5"}
{"text":"I used to think this place was okay. Now its just an avoid at all cost. It is expensive in comparison to the dozens of other hk cafe places in the area. And they dont have better service or food either. I asked them for breakfast to just separate the pork chop on instant noodles and they inform me its impossisble to do so. Which is retarded. Cause the chef cooks it separate and places it on the soup. After grilling it. This is just lazy on their staff. Avoid their laxy service and expensive hk cafe food. And just go to brother or other hk cafe in the area"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place really close to our dance class and Yelp led me here. My friends who got the Hainan Chicken Rice loved their dish. They described the chicken as silky and  therice as flavourful. I had the Baked Pork Chop Rice which comes with two sauces (tomato & cream). I only liked the parts covered in the the tomato sauce since the cream sauce had NO taste. The rice was good since it seemed to have egg in it. The melted cheese was very minimal and the pork chop was only ok. My friend who got the cream sauce pasta with puff pastry wasn't very impressed since it was made with the same flavourless cream sauce. Some of the dishes came in a combo with a drink. I got hot lemon tea which I didn't like at all. 
This place is nothing special but has a extensive menu that I'd like to try more of since the pictures make it all look so good. I know now to avoid anything with cream sauce though!
Service was polite and efficient. The atmosphere is nothing special. Water is served in cheap looking plastic cups."}
{"text":"Tonight I finally give a review since I've been here few times. I have always wasn't sure how to review this restaurant because sometime is ok and sometime is not. Tonight it's the worse. Walked In with my son the waiter give me chopstick and napkin and menu. I ask one of the waitress for tea and never came. Then my son spaghetti came rice instead. The I ask the same waitress for hot sauce she went to do something else. The people here are not very alert. They walk with their head down or chat. How in the world so you see customer when they need something. Well 2 star is the best I can do. The food is just ok as usual regular restaurant."}
{"text":"First time in this location. Ordered a spicy fish noodle soup. In my experience that any spicy food need to be cooked and blended in the food to have a corrected tastes. The soup was added chilli oil to the soup which I could to that to make it spicy. The fish was cooked well but the noodle was too soft. One star less for restaurant only accept cash. A business can't even accept credit card is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Out of the 3 location this one is the better one. The service is better and it's roomy. The food is better.  Nothing more I can see."}
{"text":"It is a place you need to go to if your in Toronto. It have meals great for breakfast and lunch that are filling. The meals are cheap and worth it.

I always get the salty beef in roman and it comes with butter toast with condensed milk. I love this and it is the best meal on the menu."}
{"text":"One of my top two favourite HK style cafes in Markham. This place gets super packed on weekends so try to come before noon. Food is quick and always tastes amazing. Hainanese chicken and teriyaki chicken baked rice are my fave. Only thing that sucks is that it's CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Been to the other one on Woodbine and I can't say based on this one menu order which one is better but here they have the bubble waffle dessert.  I decided to spend the $10 which is more than what the average meal costs. It doesn't disappoint and the presentation is quite nice.  The other dishes look decent but not that flavorful (from the other people eating with me). It's got the presentation/ambiance going for it. The neat thing is that they have different meal sets at different times (and prices).  Another good thing is that it's relatively quieter than the other ones so there's less of a lineup."}
{"text":"Relatively good HK style Chinese food, good place to come when I'm craving some baked pork chop rice with tomato sauce. The portion are relatively big so it would definitely satisfy the typical human being if not more. I always find myself sharing the meal with others or bring it home for take out. The prices are fair, like around $10 for a typical meal item. This would be a regular 3 star Chinese restaurant in terms of taste, however I'm giving them one extra because their service is relatively attentive. My bf wanted mayo with his fries so the employees went out of their way to understand his request and got it for him even though it's not typical so we were happy with the extra service. Overall, this restaurant leaves a happy and positive impression upon leaving and will return for more HK style food!

{"text":"Came here for lunch around 12:30 on Sunday. It was busy but we got a table almost right away. This is probably the cleanest HK cafe I've been to in the toronto area.  Food was as expected for this type of restaurant. Tasty favorites. We ordered the baked  pork chop rice, based fish filet with cream sauce change to spaghetti, cutlet chicken on rice with egg. They don't have baked  Portuguese chicken rice here. Food was fast and portions big. Price is acceptable given cleanliness and great attentive service. Great for families and young kids. Huge accessible washroom with change table. We also had the bubble waffle with Mango ice cream and it was nice. A little overpriced for this dish but you're sitting down eating this and they bring clean plates and cutlery. Overall great HK cafe in clean comfortable environment. Would come back again."}

{"text":"No.

No.

No.

No.

Did I get the point across yet?

No.

No.

No. 

I guess I should write an actual review. 

Uhmmm... I went because it was said that they had the best Hainanese Chicken. Maybe that's what Hainanese Chicken tastes like in Hainan but... Wait, is Hainan a place or a race... or a type of cuisine? No clue. Anyways, it's similar to what in Thailand is called Khao Man Gai, but just. No. The rice was bland. The chicken was salty. The soup... I actually liked, but many people seemed to not care for it according to other reviews. 

In conclusion.

No.

No no no. 

No.

Major disappointment."}
{"text":"My cousin had told me to check this joint out when I came up to visit from Boston. The place might have the best Hainan Chicken Rice I've had in the longest time. The rice itself tasted amazing on its own and the dish came with a nice serving of broth soup to wash everything down. My little brother ordered a lunch special and it came with toast with condensed milk syrup poured on top which brought me back to my days living in HK. I would move to Toronto just for this place."}
{"text":"Came in today during dinner time. Lots of seating, clean, and nice atmosphere. Was impressed by the massive menu! I got a corned beef sandwich for $4 and my BF got pork with rice for $8.50. Food came in 5 minutes, which is surprisingly fast. 

Corned beef sandwich is a good serving, more corned beef than sandwich which is rare for Hongkong style cafes I have been to. Taste is pretty standard.

My BF got pork with rice and egg, which tastes just ok. The pork was fatty though, and the rice is salty. Maybe not even worth the $8.50.

I would go back to try another dish, but so far, nothing is too special about this place."}
{"text":"Clean and bright atmosphere for HK style breakfast and milk tea. This location has the friendliest staff amongst the chain, and that's what pushed their score to 4 stars rather than 3.

Their egg sandwich is probably one of the better ones around gta, definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

Came here for lunch after church and the place was buzzing with people. Parking at this plaza is packed so be prepared. Look for spots on the far side of the plaza.

Extensive menu from set lunch to desserts, including bbtea and waffles. Service was fast and attentive. We ordered: 1) fried noodles with tofu, vegetables and mushrooms, and a fried pork cutlet with a fried egg and teriyaki sauce. 

The fried noodles were yummy-- large portion and nice balance between chewy and crispy. The pork cutlet was delicious: tender meat and crispy panko coating. The teriyaki sauce is served on the side topped with shredded seaweed and toasted sesame seeds. Perfectly fried egg on top of a mound of white rice. Unfortunately the rice was dry-- the sauce and egg made it edible. Also unfortunate was the numerous flies that we had to shoo away. 

Set lunches come with free drink - we ordered HK milk tea. Debit and cash only. 

All in all, an authentic HK style lunch that fed 2 adults and two kids for under $20... I'm happy. Will come back to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Summary: decent option for Hong Kong style cafe, highlighted by their Hainanese chicken

What I Liked: Hainanese Chicken
What I Didn't: Curry Noodles
What I'll Get Next: probably Hainanese chicken

In 2017, this was one of my lunch spots, as it was a couple minutes from my workplace. It's tucked away in an unassuming plaza, but gets really packed! Modern decor, fast service, slightly above average prices for fairly good food.

The HAINANESE CHICKEN is boneless (say WHAT? yeah!), and is very tender and juicy. I can see why it's so highly regarded, especially with the standard sauces complementing it very well The rice is slightly less flavourful than I've had, but it's not bad. All in all, a good dish.

The CURRY NOODLES, though, were pretty... disappointing. Potatoes were very few, and the ones that were there were pretty much like rocks. Overall, quite bland.

Portion sizes are nothing to write home about, but it's decent. Everything else is pretty average. I'd come out of my way here for the chicken, but not much else - but it remains an option when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I've came here a lot of times but this is one of the most disappointing experience I've had here. I called the restaurant to know when they are going to change the lunch menu from the breakfast one so I can know if I have enough time to eat their Hainan Chicken before work. They told me that their lunch menu will be handed out at 11 so I came here at 10:45 and grabbed a seat. I asked to make sure if the Hainan chicken will be ready to be sold at 11 and the waitress said yes. I ordered French Toast first so I don't have to be hungry waiting. At 11, I ordered it and apparently, they told me that I have to wait until the person assigning seats to change all the menus for the incoming people and the people siting in order for them to change it to the lunch menu. It's 11:15, my French toast is still not here, I still can't order my Hainan Chicken and I'm already going to be late for work. Thank you for the great hospitality guys! Will definitely not return next time."}
{"text":"Food is average. No change table for babies. Do no accept any card payment- credit or debit. No sign on door saying cash only. We have to go out and get cash to pay."}
{"text":"I feel like this restaurant has too much hype, we didn't find that their food was anything to brag about. 
We ordered the set dinner meal that comes with a croissant, soup, main and a drink. Deep fried squid tenticles, \"baked\" spaghetti with chicken, and Japanese roe fried rice. Also 2 iced lemon teas. The croissant for the soup was bland and overly buttered for such a tiny pastry. The soup was cream of mushroom and it was so disappointing, basically was all cream and 2 slivers of mushroom. Tasted bland and boring, didn't finish. The spaghetti was also very bland. You have to pay more to add cheese ontop, which is dumb. Cheese really should be included, it's not that expensive to add shredded cheese. Other cafe style restaurants include the cheese to make it taste better. So basically we got soup cream mixed with the spaghetti, because I don't understand what point it tasted \"baked\". The Japanese fried rice was the better tasting out of the dishes we ordered, it was at least flavoured. The squid tenticles were okay, nothing to brag about. Overall, the bill came pretty high and most likely won't be back. Not worth it for the taste and value."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Phoenix. The first time was at a different location. I'm happy to say that this one was better.

For $10, I had one of their lunch specials. It was a chicken cutlet with egg on tomato sauce fried rice. The chicken was tender, the egg yolk was runny, and the portion was generous. The tomato sauce could have been a tad sweeter, and there could have been more egg in the rice base, but those are small details. I also got lemon water as my drink. It's really hard to mess up lemon water. I had 3/4 of my lunch and packed the rest to go. 

Service was surprisingly good, especially at the end. 

Why 3 stars? I still can't justify the price point. Especially at HK style cafes, I don't see why a baked rice lunch special should run at $10. $7-8, maybe, but not $10."}
{"text":"I don't know whether to say I'm ashamed that as a Chinese person who has grown up in Toronto, I'd never been to Phoenix before this time, or thankful that I'd never been to Phoenix before this time.

I came a few weeks ago and I was super excited, because it seems like every Chinese young person has been to Phoenix before, and I wanted to be one of the cool kids. Besides, if everyone is going, doesn't that mean it should be worth going to? Apparently not, if my trip was a typical experience.

We let the waitress know we were a party of three, and she showed us to a table. As soon as we reached that table, she discovered a party of five had just come in behind us, so she told us to change tables to a table in the back next to the serving station. I don't like feeling displaced. 

We ordered a Japanese style pork cutlet with egg on rice, a clam and mushroom on white sauce pasta with puff pastry, and a Hoi Nam chicken rice. The pork cutlet with egg on rice was tasty, but the portion was a tad lacking. There were very little clams in the white sauce, and the whole dish was quite bland. I know Chinese style white sauce is usually lacking in cream flavor, but this was more than that. The whole dish needed more salt. The puff pastry is pretty, but it really doesn't add anything to the dish. The Hoi Nam chicken rice was supposed to be boneless. I found two bones. Other than that, it was alright. Not the best Hoi Nam chicken I've ever had. Certainly not the worst. The portion could have been bigger though. Oh. The soup that came with it actually just tasted like water with green onions. Perhaps there was a tiny touch of chicken broth powder in there, but just barely. 

Weirdest experience of the night. Most Chinese restaurants of this variety have a condiment rack on each table. When we got to our table, we had one. It had chili oil. I know it did, because I like chili oil, and I usually check to see if it's there. When our food came, I turned to my chili oil and it was missing. Upon looking at the table next to mine, I noticed that they did not have a condiment rack. However, they had chili oil. Dun dun dun. I'm guessing they took it while we were praying for our meal. I ended up asking the waitress for chili oil. She asked the table that had taken ours if they were using it (they were finished for the time being), and gave it to us. Then she told us that we could share it. I don't mind sharing, but it's a tad tacky for a restaurant to tell us (not ask us nicely) to share. 

I've had much better HK cafe type food in Toronto. I've had bigger portions of better food for cheaper prices. I'm not at all tempted to come again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hainan Chicken which was good.  The rice was very flavourful.  We also ordered a chicken steak baked rice with garlic sauce.  I did not like the garlic sauce.  I liked that it had a garlic flavour but did not like The spice it was mixed with.  Too bad the meals did not come with a drink."}
{"text":"Phoenix really changed the game for cha chang tangs/HK Cafes in Toronto as previously these type cafes were kinda a dive spot but with Phoenix, they have a modern feel. The interior is all modern, the washroom aren't disgusting and the food is actually pretty decent and not oily like most. 

When it first opened their used to be line ups all the time but since other places have taken on the Phoenix style, line ups aren't as crazy anymore. 

I go here if I don't want something too rich in taste ie, fatty, oily but the portions aren't as big as other HK cafes and the prices are more expensive. Unfortunately their 230pm afternoon specials aren't the greatest as well. So I haven't really been back in a while since discovering other HK cafes or for the price I'm ok paying a little extra for dim sum. 

Parking is pretty decent and I'd recommend trying to get a booth as the tables along the side you'll be sharing with strangers."}

I have to admit it's pretty amazing and it's $10.50 only. Def worth."}
{"text":"Supposedly this location is the better one compare to their other chains. 

Ordered chicken curry and rice, hai nam chicken and rice, and beef ho fun noodle. 

Chicken curry did not disappoint. It has enough meat and the curry was just right - not too watery and not too thick. 

Ho nam chicken was so so. The chicken oil rice was sold out. 

The noodle dish was good. 

Parking lot gets busy - had to park further away from the restaurant."}
{"text":"A popular brunch place located in Markham that is usually quite busy. They have quite the wide selection of HK Style brunch foods that are reasonably priced. It wasn't busy when we arrived at around 2:30 for an afternoon lunch. They mostly take walk ins and only take reservations for groups of 5 or more people. I ordered the Fried Chicken and Pork Culet on Rice with gravy sauce. Pretty good dish for $10.50 Like an HK Style brunch, you need to get your fix of HK Style Milk Tea and the meal doesn't come with a drink but it's a must have!! It's only $1.25 which isn't too bad if you order a meal. Food came out literally about 5 minutes after we ordered, talk about real quick service on the meal delivery. Good portions of the meat and quite delicious. It's a nice Chinese gravy sauce on the meats. Overall, I had a nice dining experience here and definitely recommend for anyone looking for good cheap HK Style brunch in the Scarborough/Markham area!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars. I've only been there once and it was a Thursday evening 6pm, not busy at all. They provide a HUGE variety of foods ranging from breakfast to dinner and desserts, and different cuisines including Hong Kongese, Thai and Chinese. I wasn't sure what to order and to be on the safe side, I chose a Beef Fried rice with shrimp paste (I've never had shrimp paste in fried rice). My friend ordered Stir Fried Noodles in black bean sauce. 

Foods came pretty quick, and the portion was huge - value for money in terms of quantity and fill you up yes, but taste was meh. My fried rice was quite plain with bits of beef, lettuce and green onion. I tasted my friend's dish and it had a burning taste.

Service was like typical casual chinese restaurants. I would not order the same dish again but I am willing to give it a 2nd chance and try something else on their menu. Their desserts sound and look quite interesting too.

Hianese Chicken is good during my first time. On my third visit, it no longer tasted as good."}
{"text":"Been trying to find a Hong Kong Style Cafe place since leaving Calgary. Would have thought it would be easy in Toronto but not until I came across Phoenix.

Classic HK Cafe fare, tremendous large menu. Noodle soups, curries, rices, noodles, sandwiches, combos etc.

Had the Malaysian curry beef, excellent. Chicken with ginger rice, excellent. Baked spaghetti wit beef and tomatoes, excellent. 

As per cafe, dishes come with a hot coffee or tea during certain times and they have specials on weekends. Definitely a good stop for a lunch meal. Limited seating so this place is packed often at peak hours."}

{"text":"Giving this place even one star is a gift, as far as I'm concerned, for this place committed the two most basic mistakes a restaurant can make:

1.  IT MADE ME SICK.  I GOT FOOD POISONING for the first time in TWENTY YEARS eating at this place, and I had to take an almost entire week off of work to recover!
2. THEY WOULDN'T TAKE MY MONEY.  They have a \"ten dollar minimum\" on debit purchases, which they apply to your pre-tax amount, not the amount they're charging you.  Yes, if your bill is $10.75, they will tell you you can't pay with debit because of this minimum.  Fine, I'll get a drink.

A majority of items on the menu are under ten dollars, so this is clearly a money grab, not an attempt at being a restaurant that has its customers' satisfaction in mind."}
{"text":"Hit-or-miss
Their Hainanese Chicken was really good. Rice had that nice chicken flavour to it. This dish also came out super fast (in less than 5min after we placed the order).
Chicken & veg on steamed rice: do not order this dish. Although it had good amount of chicken, too much rice (as if they tried to make this dish look somewhat appealing) and too little veg (several pieces of carrots, mushroom, and four stems of Chinese broccoli). The sauce was just slimy and lacked flavour. 

Overall, cheap food but because they have so many items on the menu, it is likely that you could end up ordering a wrong dish."}
{"text":"Brunch. Bland. Service. Mediocre. Retarded server puts down four cups. Two coffees and two mixed coffee/tea. Doesn't tell us which is which. No emotion. No gratitude. Must be how they do it in Hong Kong since this is a Hong Kong style joint. Not for me. Don't want to come back. I'm Canadian. This is Canada. Not Hong Kong."}
{"text":"Alright, so I'm going to say that it's a shame the average rating for this place is below 4 stars. Haters goin' to hate!

For those who are unfamiliar with this style of cuisine, like my Korean brother from another mother I brought here, it's a melting pot of Cantonese cuisine with British Commonwealth flavour. It's like Chinese diner food, featuring deep fried, heavily sauced favourites on top of fried rice and baked for texture and delicious, mouth-burning goodness. 

Okay, now to the food... The baked rice with pork chop and half tomato, half cream sauce (aka ying yang) baked rice is a favourite for anyone making a foray to this cuisine, yes I am talking to you! But the classic, must have signature dish here is the Hainanese Chicken. This is an authentic dish from southern China which is slowly poached to extract maximum chicken flavour. To help wash things down, try a coffee and tea (ying yang) drink, which is creamy, silky and delicious. Go cold for those hot summer days. 

Yes, I saw that someone commented that this place is \"pricier\" than traditional HK cafés but you get what you pay for. This place is higher quality, cleaner and just a better feel than most HK cafés you go to. Plus it ain't that much more and very reasonably priced.

Only thing is service is a bit spotty, but that's what you come to expect when grabbing Chinese food with great value, let's be honest. 

Anyways, this place not three and a half stars. A sub 4 star place isn't busy on a Saturday morning..."}
{"text":"This is a Hong Kong afternoon tea style restaurant (???) that I frequently visit with my family. I particularly liked this restaurant for its authentic HK style cuisines at a reasonable price as well as prompt services for people who are on a strict schedule.

Ambience: The overall lighting of this restaurant is reasonably bright, typical of restaurants of this setting. There is a great deal of background chatter and a lack of music which is also reasonable and typical, but not for the sound sensitive ear or for those who want a relaxed dining experience. There is an overall pleasant aura of HK style milk tea and I highly recommend it to those who are looking into an authentic milk tea experience.
3/5 stars 

Service: Servers were overall courteous and responded in a decent manner. However, they do not accept credit card payments. They also gave us our hot teas before our meal which by the time we have the stomach for, the drinks were already cold. 
2.5/5 stars

Food: I ordered a chicken steak and pork chop with gravy sauce on rice. The appearance was a bit lacklustre compared to some of the other dishes being served: the steak was very plain with no extra ingredients and the egg fried rice did not seem freshly fried and not appetizing. The taste, however, saved some of the points with both the chicken steak and the pork chop tasting satisfactory. It blended very well with the gravy sauce and was a mild delight with its juiciness and softness.
3/5 stars

Health: overall. Not a balanced diet. The protein (steak and pork chop) here comprised of about 40% of the meal, carbs were too abundant (50%), with vegetables comprising only 10%. The veggies did not have enough fiber, consisting mostly of peas, carrots and zucchinis. To be fair though, there are meals with a heavier vegetable and fiber content such as the Korean stone bowl with spicy pork.
2/5 stars

Price: Decent price, reflective of the meal served, and typical of those found in afternoon tea style restaurants.

Overall: This is a decent restaurant for its authentic HK afternoon tea style experience. I would recommend going to this restaurant for quick lunches, utilizing its prompt service and cheaper lunch menus. Not for the customer who is looking for a refined fine dining experience, but for those who have a diner experience in mind to go with family.

Overall rating: 3/5 stars"}
{"text":"This is a go to spot for lunch for me. They have a lot of variety of Chinese dishes, and also some dessert selection. I love their egg waffle with Icecream, and Japanese style chicken steak on rice. If you are a sucker for sweeter dishes, those are the must gets. Other dishes like baked spaghetti and rice dishes are also good. 

I think price is fair, it is a bit more than other hk restaurants but the quality of the dishes and space of the restaurant makes up for it! Most other places that serves similar food are usually a lot more cramped and small in size."}
{"text":"I had a pretty good late dinner at this restaurant with my sis and dad. We ordered the honey bbq pork collar and egg on rice, hainanese chicken with chicken oil rice, and baked pork chop cutlet on rice. The first two orders came out within minutes, and I was pretty surprised at how fast the food was ready (though the restaurant wasn't very crowded at the time we went). The pork collar tasted very good. The meat was soft, and there was a good amount of honey bbq flavor (not overpowering at all). I felt like the meat portion was way too small for the amount of rice they gave us though. The hainanese chicken was amazing! The meat was tender and very juicy, and it came with two dipping sauces. One sauce was essentially scallion-ginger oil.. the other sauce was unfamiliar to me, and I found its flavor to be a little weird. The chicken oil rice was really tasty, and it was an excellent complement to the chicken. I didn't really care much for the soup, but I would still say that this dish was by far my favorite of the 3 we ordered. The baked pork chop cutlet was decent. The outside was nice and crispy while the inside was not overcooked. I've had better pork chops before, but I couldn't complain too much about it. The sauce was pretty thick, and I liked it.

For desserts, we ordered an ice cream pancake and waffle (both black sesame), and we also ordered panna cotta. They only had one type of panna cotta available even though their panna cotta specials page on the table advertised multiple options. The pancake order and panna cotta came out reasonably fast. The pancake (which was closer to a crepe) was delicious. For the price we paid, I would've maybe expected another pancake to come with it (because they're pretty thin), but I would still recommend this dessert. I only tried a little bit of the panna cotta, but I wasn't that impressed..seemed kind of boring to me. The waffle took a while to come out (probably 2-3 times the wait time of the pancake). The waffle was on the hard side, and I definitely prefer my waffles way softer.. I couldn't tell if they screwed up our order or if that's just their style. Still, despite being too hard, the flavor of the waffle was pretty nice. They only give one scoop of ice cream with the waffle, so I felt like they could've given another scoop to make the dessert more balanced.

The service was excellent in the beginning, but it went very downhill towards the end of the meal. It took a while for us to get our waitress's attention after we finished eating. She asked us to pay early before we finished eating because they were closing down their system or something which I thought was pretty strange. The waitress also took a long time to give us change for the cash we gave her..almost to the point where I started to worry she might've thought we were giving her a ridiculously generous tip. Overall, I felt like the prices were reasonable except for the desserts.. We nearly doubled our dinner cost by ordering dessert, but it was tough to pass on this after seeing some of the pictures. I would probably come back to this restaurant, but I don't think it would be one of my top priorities for food in this area. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"The portion is really large and the price is fairly reasonable. Good for gathering with friends in uptown. I simply love the pork/fish soup (seafood vermancili  is what I order)."}
{"text":"One of the most favourite go-to place for HK style meals.

The service is always quick and it is almost always packed, especially during lunch time.

Their Hoinan chicken with rice is one of the best I've ever eaten. It's a MUST order if you're new or old to this place.

Dishes are reasonably priced and usually comes with a drink (Additional $1.15 for cold drinks) 

Overall, service and food was been consistent for awhile and it keeps making me go back whenever I'm stuck on where to eat for lunch."}
{"text":"Really won't be coming back again.  Their food is mediocre at best, really nothing that special, and honestly, you could be cooking up the same if not better caliber of food at home.  

The price is really what takes it down here - expensive for a breakfast/lunch option and considering the quality of food you get, definitely not worth it.

Their signature chicken and rice dish, is very, very salty, and their portion of chicken is tiny. The \"sauce\" on their rice isn't anything special and this dish just seems to be washed in salt all over.  Again, for the price you pay, you're better of eating somewhere else.

I really don't understand all the hype around this Hong Kong styled breakfast/lunch here, especially when there are far better options around 5 minutes away."}
{"text":"I've come here multiple times, the first time I thought it was great but every subsequent time I was less than impressed and kinda bored.

The layout and decor is decent, makes you feel comfortable for those HK style cafes. It doesn't have that dingy feel which is a good thing.

The food though, is always decent. They have a good variety but nothing spectacular.

The problem that I have with it though is I find it slightly more expensive than every other place. Or they give you just a little less than the other place for the same price.

This morning I went there for breakfast, had satay beef vermicelli with condensed milk brick toast for $5.49. See, the great chinese breakfast places will give you that and eggs+ham, perhaps just a hot roll instead of brick toast, but that's ok, cause I get eggs+ham. But this place, no dice. Can't even get them together unless ordered separately.

I've come here before for their afternoon tea; the fried wings/chicken is pretty good value. From what I remember it might come with some macaroni salad?

Reliable yes, but everything else is left to be desired."}
{"text":"Ordered beef brisket noodle soup.  The soup came out cold.  The meat was also cold (as if it had been partly thawed).  Disgusting."}
{"text":"I come here quite often with my family as I live in the area. They are always busy. Decent food, fair prices. We always order the baked rice . My only complaint is that although their curry is great (I like the sauce), they give way too little beef in the curry beef brisket dish. Seriously, like two or three small pieces of beef brisket and the rest is fat or tendon that is too hard to chew. Other than that, this restaurant is pretty good."}
{"text":"Phoenix Restaurant has been at this location for ages...This location use to have many different restaurants but they somehow just didn't last. I believe this is the first location for Phoenix and this is the one that helped them expanded to like 4-5 locations now...so how successful is that...eh?!

This location just keeps on expanding when the retail store next door can't continue their business anymore; they do it subtly so It's merely noticeable... smart move... 

Parking is probably the biggest concern here becuz It's such a small plaza and parking is quite difficult... 

Food is a little more on the pricey side but quality is quite consistent...I always order their fish noodle soup with fish tofu... and Noo.. It's not fishy.. Lol..

The presentation of the foods are decent as a Hong Kong style cafe, it comes out clean and portion is decent..I really like coming here for afternoon tea...as I can order a few different items at a slightly lower price...

the main issue here is really service because it gets so busy and they do not have enough staff on the floor, you can be ignored....I ordered my honey lemon tea (ice cold) and it was sitting on the bar for over 5 mins, the ice was literally melting so it's not considered to be cold anymore..it would be \"warm\"....=P

All in all, a place I would come if I can't think of where to go.."}
{"text":"Phoenix is one of my favourite go-tos for lunch and this time around, I decided to try their Deep Fried Oats Chicken w/ Teriyaki Sauce on Rice for the first time. When the dish arrived, I was surprised at how big the chicken steak was and loved the mayo-teriyaki sauce they paired with it. The oats were fried along with the chicken, which made it extra crispy. My friend got its popular Hainanese Chicken with Chicken Oil Rice. The chicken was juicy and best of all, deboned! Leftover rice was not an issue as it was oil rice that was yummy and tasty even by itself. This dish was on par as usual.

We had the Chocolate Ice Cream Pancake for dessert. Presentation and taste was okay but it was not worth $8.5. A little more dessert could have filled the big plate it was served in. I will definitely be back for the two dishes but will leave dessert to somewhere else."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars but I'm really pissed they don't accept credit cards...I had the fried needle noodles with beef, shrimp and eggs. It was pretty good, I wouldn't say anything special. WARNING the spicy paste they have on the table is SPICY AS HELL. 

The best were the pork cutlets with cheese and stuff on top on fried rice. They were so soft and gooey and cheessyyy. Yum.

Curry chicken was boooring, so boring. It comes with steamed rice and isn't that impressive.

In case anyone is wondering, yes I tried all 3. I am a so-called \"do you wanna finish this\" receptacle, so i usually get to try many things at one place!! Yay me. 

The actual restaurant was buzzing at 1pm on a weekday, we had to make a reservation so got seated right away.  All in all I really liked it, there's so much to choose from I almost had a stroke.... next time I'll try more and bring cash!!!!"}
{"text":"Good selection. Prices were affordable.  Reminded me of my time in HK... :)
I really enjoyed the French Toast and coffee..."}
{"text":"so lets get started

alright MEI, you aint slick. as a waitress, you get 1 star and a speaking for dummies handbook.
phoenix, how you gonna hire a waitress who is mute? never said a word while taking orders and taking away dishes. took away my unfinished dish and didn't stop when I asked her to.

looking for a cheap dinner? heres the place. as in cheap of course I mean in terms of price and quality. and service too. and wait time. and quality. 

Wait time is the third biggest problem. Every dish comes out at different times. 
My noodles: 10 mins, 
spare ribs rice dish: 20 mins, 
my sprite: 25 mins (???), 
Fried rice: 25 mins 

I found a load of shit in my spare ribs rice dish one time. couldn't tell if it was literal shit or the spare ribs sauce. they taste the same anyways. 

Every dish my family orders is inconsistent. after a few visits, then you know what to order, and what not to order. 

So ratings /5:

Food: 3
Prices: 3
Service (Mei): 1
Service (everyone else I've had): 3
Wait time: 2

Overall: 0.5 because of Mei"}
{"text":"Solid HK cafe. Probably one of the better quality ones. Food is good, prices are reasonable and service is quick.

We forgot our phone one time at this Phoenix...called the next day and picked it up! Honest and reliable. Thank you to the servers of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Modern, Clean, usually packed with people, wait for food was a bit long

Food:
1. Chicken Cutlet with Teriyaki sauce : Chicken was nicely deep fried, the rice was a bit hard, Teriyaki sauce was good. $7.50 + drink 

2. Chicken Cutlet in tomatoe sauce with spaghetti: Tomatoe sauce was a bit bland, other than that it was a fairly enjoyable dish. 

Overall: Cheap and enjoyable. Good for the price. I got a 15% discount, so ill defintely be back."}
{"text":"Once upon a time this place symbolized the epitome of HK Style Cafe. At their very best there were lineups out the door and while the lineups remain, they are certainly a lot shorter than they used to be. With a plethora of options in the greater Markham area, this place has diminished in appeal over the past few years.

Compound the aforementioned with their seemingly unwarranted(and constant) rise is prices and cutbacks in quality, the heydays of Phoenix have passed.

Their food is still pretty decent and you can tell they are struggling to keep up their quality while trying to increase their margins. Cutbacks such as reducing quantity and size of dishes and minimizing \"sides\" by using frozen peas and carrots not only leaves a sour taste in your mouth but also a half empty stomach on your way out.

The last few times I had a meal here (not by choice) they were handing out discount coupons after your meal. I guess they are trying to ease the transition for folks now expected to pay a premium price for not so premium stuff."}
{"text":"My mom actually told me that she heard this place was \"OK\", so I went to try it with her.  Just to give you a heads up, I would catagorize this food as \"westernized hong kong chinese\".  It's cafe style with everything from noodle soup, to pork chop casseroles.  

From the outside, I was really expecting a highly urban area, with newly designed decor.  Reason why I say this is one of the first things that they advertise is a big sign saying who owns the store, who manages it and who designed it (I figured they used a \"designer\").  Upon entry, I guess some of my expectations were true; everything was newly renovated (the place is relatively new) with sleek elegant designs.  The place where they failed is the bar and seating area.  I mean, it looks like a fast food court.

The service is about the same as a fast food court too.  At least with table service (think about sitting in the 100 levels at a Toronto Raptors game).  It really seems that they treat you like another person taking up a seat, which can eventually be filled up by another person...

Other than that, the food is mearly so-so.  I mean it wasn't exactly mind blowing.  I had the pork chop casserole and my mom had the onion pork chops.  Each dish was alright, I would probably give it about a 5/10 if I had to grade it.  It isn't the best thing I've ever had.

While the food is not that amazing here, the thing that boggles me is how much food you get for the price.  I mean, for the buck, you get a lot of bang.  To give you an example, for a 8 dollar meal (onion pork chops) you get a beverage, about 3 bowls worth of rice, and about 2 pork chops.  Insane... how can you possibly eat all that over a sitting of lunch?  Oh ya, I forgot, I wanted to fall asleep at work.

My only con about the \"value\" of this place is that most places will include soup as part of the \"combo\".  I guess that is attributed to this place being more like a food court and less like a cafe.

All in all, I would recommend this place if you want a place to eat cheap (ie. office lunch trip)."}
{"text":"Food is decent, but a bit on the pricey side. Bought a pork chop with rice for $10.50, what I got was mostly rice with a bit of pork chop on rice. Not sure I would go here again for this reason alone - for this price one is better off at Congee Queen."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but first time for breakfast. Came here with my family and we ordered the set breakfast. It comes with a drink as well. 

Our meal:

1. Ham & Veggie Soup Vermicelli with Bun
 Drink: HK style Coffee

2. Egg & Ham Sandwich.
Drink: HK Style Coffee

3. Tomato Sauce Fried Porkchop with 2 Eggs & Bun
Drink: HK Style Coffee & Tea
My husband had this and said it was bland in taste.

4. Satay Beef Soup Vermicelli
Drink: HK Style Coffee & Tea
Mine was quite salty for my taste. But the toast was yummy, do was the coffee tea mix.

One thing that was quite funny was, our drinks came first. But they all look the same. So I kindly asked the waitress which is which. She questioned me back of what I ordered. I said I was just curious which ones are coffee & Tea mix? So she finally pointed them out. Lol!"}
{"text":"My first time here with friends, I came in on a Tuesday afternoon and had to wait about two minutes to be seated. I think we were fortunate to get a seat so quickly, considering that the entire restaurant was full. Parking was overcrowded, so I suggest going at a less busy time if you are driving!

The menu is quite overwhelming. I decided to stick to what the restaurant was famous for so I ordered the Hainanese chicken, which came with steamed rice and a side of soup. The chicken was boneless, which made it very easy to eat! It goes great with the additional sauces that they provide on the side. The broth was light, but still flavorful.

My friends ordered the Yunnan Vermicelli, the black sesame toast and the HK style milk tea. The sesame toast tastes so good! It has a very similar taste to peanut butter. One person could easily eat it all. I never got to try the vermicelli, but it didn't seem my friend enjoyed it. Her husband had to put spoonfuls of spicy chili to make the most out of the dish. The HK milk tea has a very strong bitter milk taste to it. I would suggest this tea to someone who is not a huge fan of sweets!

I'm giving this place a 3.5/5, but rounding it to 4-stars since the Hainanese chicken was so good. Boneless chicken is the best chicken!! I highly recommend that dish."}
{"text":"Very disappointed at my very first visit here at this restaurant.  Came in for Victoria Day because my boyfriend and i forgot that most of the restaurants were closed because of the holiday.  

Came in, got sat right away and looked the menu. Looking at the menu was a bit overwhelming for me because there was a lot of food sections and yet a lot of food to choose from. I guess that's one of the good thing. But the menu kinda mislead how we wanted to order.  Here's the catch, if you wanted something that looks exactly like the picture that is shown from the menu, you have to read carefully that there's an extra $1 for everything you want to add or have it to look exactly like it.  I was so disappointed as i ordered a Pork Chop Cutlet dish that came with mushroom and cream as the sauce and you can either choose rice or spaghetti on the bottom as the base. It was supposed to be baked, but the server didn't really try selling the \"oh did you want to add cheese on top?\". When we asked what kind of base the  garlic sauce was, my boyfriend asked if it's cream (wondering if they'll just add garlic instead), the server just straight bluntly said \"garlic\"... lol, okay. So we just went for the mushroom and cream sauce instead. What made me more disappointed is that even though the server didn't sell the cheese to be baked on top of the pork chop cutlet, the sauce was in between the meat and the rice....hense, it wasn't even baked at all. However, still ate the food, despite being really hungry. Towards the end, we ordered take out food to take with us home and asked for the bill.  

What really got us annoyed is that, when i went up there to pay for the bill, the server then said \"oh, we only accept cash..we don't have the machine right now\" .... WHERE DOES IT SAY OUTSIDE THE DAMN DOOR THAT YOU GUYS ONLY ACCEPT CASH.

my boyfriend and i never carry cash around us, unless we need to. But this location really disappointed us. The servers should've told us at the beginning that they only accept cash before sitting us down. He had to drive to a convenience store just to see if he can cash out money. We told them that they needed to put a sign outside and the server just didn't say anything at all. GAVE NO TIP and whoever was in-charge of the restaurant had the audacity to smile and say \"Sorry about that, have a good day\". 

Def not coming back to this location at all."}
{"text":"Food is okay not the best but the prices are pretty reasonable. There are other places you can go to but if you want something quick, this Phoenix location is ok."}
{"text":"This is a HK style restaurant that I frequently visit.
HK style restaurant tea is known for good price, good food and fast (I didn't say good) service.
Especially good deals on High tea, and breakfast.

Speed read:
1) HK style Milk Tea - good and consistent
2) Above average price (you will spend more or less $10 per person)
3) Menu is not typical, there's always a twist to justify their premium price
4) Hit and Miss on the dish.

The number ONE reason I visit this place often is the lack of competent competitor in that area.  Sadly speaking, it's the lack of better choice on food quality from the surrounding.

HK Milk tea here is always great.  Better than the hit and miss at Marathon café.

Quality is good and above average.  Most of the time it's pretty good.  Even if they mess up sometime, it's not terrible (unlike some other locals where you could get spoiled ingredient)
E.g. We order baked pork chop rice, and a baked fried chicken rice.  Chicken is tender, and properly season, where the pork chop is dry and dull.

What I hate here is the menu is not typical of HK style restaurant, and I found their added twist doesn't really add quality but I feel it's merely a gimmick to charge a higher price.  If you walk in here wanted a typical wonton noodle or beef brisket noodle, sorry, you won't find it.

I can only speak to this location of their chain.  Other may or may not be as good.

Thank you for reading this far.
Tips:  Weekend breakfast is generally really busy.  Don't go at the last minute before 11am, you won't find a seat."}
{"text":"Great selection and fair pricing. The vermacelli with fish and fish broth is a favourite dish of mine and my husband loves the vermacelli with beef brisket. The soup is excellent And flavourful. The seating and environment is relatively clean and comfortable and sometimes that is a hard find with a good Chinese restaurant.  We are frequent flyers for sure."}
{"text":"Nice hongkong style restaurant. They have a large selection of food,  ????? is yummy, lunch combos also come with drinks. 

I have been eyeing their desserts and toasts for a while, maybe i will try out their dessert. I like the fact that they have rice and noodle dishes as well as desserts."}
{"text":"If I'm ever in the area and can't decide on a place to eat for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, a snack or dinner, this place always comes to mind. Food is good and decently priced. Wait staff mannerism can vary day to day and shift to shift. Generally depends on how busy it is that particular day. 

Today I decided to start the day on a good note with oatmeal, a tuna sandwich and a mill tea for $5.00. You can't really go wrong with that. Then I'll be satisfied to hit the gym. 

Starting to look like a productive day."}
{"text":"This Phoenix is decorated better than the others.  It's clean and roomy.  I've come here many times.  It's a Hong Kong style cafe which means it's a fusion Asian food.  Their club sandwich is like the ones in Hong Kong with their crust cut and beef inside.  It's really good.  Most of their dishes are really good but I like their baked dishes like the pork chop and rice.  Their beef tongue is really soft so I like to get it with their pasta and mushroom white sauce or their gravy sauce.  Don't get their plain white sauce.  It's not salty enough.  The salted chicken with Hainan sauce is really good too.  
But, you have to try their desserts.  They have crepes and waffles with ice cream that are really worth the price.  You cannot go wrong ordering one of their desserts. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went to the high school across the street and thus I was a frequent back in the days. Pheonix is one of those places Markham residents take for granted. It is one of the best hong kong style cafes in Toronto and always serve great food with piping milk tea. They also have good lunch and afternoon tea deals. My go to order is the chicken cutlet baked rice with tomato sauce & fried egg."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. I ordered one of their satay beef noodle soup which came with butter toast and HK style tea. The food was tasty. However thought it was pretty expensive for what it was. Came out to be around $12 after tax and tip for one person. I really liked how this location is spacious and had many 4 seater booths. Definitely best place to dine. I attached a picture of the place, hopefully it's shows how great the renovation is. The staff were attentive and pleasant. Overall, pretty good meal and seating but prices are steep."}
{"text":"Best HK Cafe in town. I always order the Hainanese chicken and it tastes so good. This place takes the prize for being consistent. The place is clean - never gotten a stomach ache. The staff is super friendly too! Keep up the good work and I'll see you at least once a week. :)"}
{"text":"Two words: bland and overpriced. 

Nothing has changed over the past many years except for the decor and price. 
Used to love their Hianese chicken but not the same anymore.
Don't bother getting any of the dishes containing white cream sauce or bbq sauce unless you plan to flavour it yourself with generous amounts of pepper.
Won't come back for meals. Maybe will give their dessert a try when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Phoenix is known for its spicy Malaysian curries, Hainan Chicken Rice and Fish broth noodles - I've tried all of them and they are all good! Prices are higher than other HK-style cafes and dinners only come with a drink and not soup. 

Baked Pork Chop Rice ($8-$9) - The rice portions are smaller than competitors', but fine with me. The pork chop is a bit hard and salty, but the rice is good. I like that there are two sauces - tomato and cream, and it tastes good with the melted cheese on top. 

Baked Beef Curry Rice - They have a baked version which is thick, yellow curry sauce with beef, potatoes and rice - really flavorful and not too spicy. The other version of curry is the Malaysian style, which is more spicy and served with white rice.

Baked Walnut Chicken Rice - this one isn't good. The chicken steak is salty, and basically it's just cream sauce with walnuts on top (not walnut flavored). There is also an almond cream sauce, which was pretty special tasting when I first tried it years ago, but I think they changed the pork chop to fish now."}
{"text":"And I've always been ok with their food. They are generally fresh and hot, Tho the price maybe a bit more expensive than other Hong Kong style restaurants. And you have to pay for boxes if u wanna take away the leftover ( versus others mostly provide it for free)
So this review focuses on the service and is specifically for this Phoenix location*

Last night bf and I went to this Phoenix at around 9pm. So it was close to closing time. And that's when all the problems started. Ive been to this Phoenix before with no problem. But service was bad last night. I know it's a Friday night and the staff probably wanted to take off ASAP, but I didnt really expect less service.... After all I didn't get to pay less for the good (except for tips)

First, after we sat down, cups of water were thrown to us. 

Then when the food was served, the guy brought the utensils with his bare hand touching the front end of the fork, of the knife, of the spoon! Although his hands MAYBE clean (I said maybe because there was some mopping going on I wasn't aware if he touched the mop or not) I still didn't want to see that the food was somehow being indirectly touched by his bare hands through the fork and eventually into my mouth..... 

Also when bf was asking for extra mayo the dude looked so confused.... Maybe he's too tired from the day.

Half way through our late dinner, we were being asked to pay. The lady said because they wanted to count the till. There's not the most pleasant but it's understandable so I put my MasterCard on the tray. And when the dude saw it from the next table, he was yelling and asking \"IS THAT MASTERCARD?\" I replied yes and he yelled back, \"NONONO, ONLY CASH AND DEBIT!!\" I was like really? I remembered that I was able to pay by credit card before. Maybe at this Phoenix or the one on bayview but I'm sure I've paid using credit card before. 

I put a $20 bill on the tray and when the change came back I took all the toonies and loonies. The guy came by and flipped the receipt, in front of us, to see if there's extra tips underneath and he was disappointed. He didn't walk away with the tray hoping that more would be given. Then he came back again to pick up the tray, disappointed again.

I've never, so in the face, tipped little. But it's because I seldom encounter bad service like this. If he would have said anything about the tips I would so ask him to recall what he has done to our night. 

Two stars both for food."}
{"text":"Food is always good, service fast (although not always friendly). Think that maybe they put a touch too much MSG into their food, but hey, it's a Chinese \"fast food\" joint so as far as those go, this place is great!"}
{"text":"I really like the decor at this location and the speedy service. The place was fairly busy on a Thursday night but there was no wait.

FOOD
The food was piping hot when it arrived - we ordered  the Yunnan Vermicelli with Fish Filets in Fish Broth, Cantonese Fried Noodles, and Chicken & Pork With Gravy and Fried Rice.

The noodle dishes were great - they came in huge portions and had a lot of fish filet pieces. They did not skimp out on the fish! The pork and chicken dish was ok, the gravy did not taste too great.

SERVICE
We got a table promptly upon arrival and was served hot tea when we were looking through the menu. They did not have some of the dishes we wanted when we ordered which is a reflection of their exhaustive menu (too many dishes). It felt as if I was reading a short story. The dishes came quickly which was great cause we were starving! However, it took them forever to get us the bill and a take out box.

VISIT AGAIN? - for sure! I can't wait to come here for lunch or afternoon tea."}
{"text":"I genuinely really like Phoenix restaurant. 

There's plenty of options to choose from the menu and the price of the food is very reasonable. I tend to get one of the combos and I have always attempted to try something different which keeps me going back. The set meals come with choice of drink, however if you want a cold drink it would be an extra dollar. 

Service is fast so no complaints. Try not to go during the busy times although I tend to go during the afternoon tea (better deals then too!), or late dinner to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"Lots of food selections with reasonable price. Good service. Waitress are always very friendly, nice family style restaurant."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter how good the food is if you never get it. Waited for half an hour for our food with my grandmother and they forgot to send the order in. They didn't even know who took our order and tried to take it again. At that point we just left. 1 star is absolutely deserved for such terrible service."}
{"text":"easy going hk cafeteria food lol love their hainam chicken and their beef satay \"ramen\" (like minute noodles but hey i do not mind that, it's delicious, go ahead, add an egg, live a little) my friend comes here and actually orders the macaroni soup and toast. don't judge, it's on the menu!! the heart wants what it wants lol"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, especially since it's a favorite of our friends, but  ... \"to each their own.\" Prices and portions are reasonable but I've had better HK style food.  The egg on the baked pork chop rice was almost raw, like it was just cracked on top.  Pork chop was very fatty and I really hate when they give you a center cut pork chop that is dry! Noodles were salty and really lacked any flavor at all.  Service is lacking, but normal for Asian restaurants and those who don't speak the language."}
{"text":"Price is a bit more expensive than other Hong Kong Style Cafe.  I usually came here for a breakfast combo or an afternoon tea combo.  I really like their HK style milk tea, French Toast (with peanut butter), and Deep Fried Octopus.

This location is bigger than other locations, and recently I came here for a group of 20+ people.  I'm glad that they take my reservation.  They also assign a waitress for us, as we have many non-Chinese in our group.

Their desserts are very nice, and it's good to share with a group or between couple :-D 

I'll give 4 stars if this place is not pricey..."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I work in the area, so Phoenix is one of my lunch places.  After many many years, I don't know what to order from their Lunch menu any more.  Their menu stays the same in the past 5 years.  Price got increase a lot in the past couple years as well.

My favourite dishes in their Set Lunch Menu are:
 - Baked Chicken Steak Cutlet & Egg on Rice w/ Tomato Sauce
 - Baked Chicken Steak in Honey & Garlic Sauce on Rice

Their Special Tea Set Menu is still my favourite in this restaurant.  My favourite dishes in Tea Set Menu are: 
 - Cuttlefish Ball & Seaweed Yannan Vermicelli
 - Baked Seafood Macaroni w/ Cream Sauce and Cheese
 - Deep Fried Chicken Leg *** LOVE!!!
 - Pork Chop Cutlet with Instant Noodle in Soup
 - French Toast with Peanut Butter

Sometimes, I wait until 2:30pm for my lunch... as I really don't know what to order from their lunch menu... so it's better for me to order the tea set.

Their HK style milk tea is quite good.  They have two bartenders in this location, and honestly, one of them mix the best milk tea than the other.  I even ask for her work schedule and try to order my milk tea during her shift :-D"}
{"text":"Cling.... clingggggg .....the cutlery fell in nowhere and landed on our table.......and ....
stomp!.......  the plate of noodle dropped right in front of me...... I turned my head and was about to ask for two bowls but I didn't see anyone!
*REPLAY*......... MIB came out from the kitchen with a plate of silver needle noodle with shrimp, BBQ pork and eggs. He walked over to our table, and dropped the cutlery and the plate of noodle on our table in his arm's length.  He turned his back against us at the time he dropped the cutlery and plate; as if he was running a relay.  He picked up his speed and ravel in the crowd of \"black\".  Fast service eh?!
The servers here are trained so well that almost all of them are providing that \"fast\" service.  They are all wearing black, but it isn't hard to tell them apart from the customers even if they aren't wearing black - just look for those without facial
expression :p
Service - can't rate coz there isn't service : (
Food is good and there is always new thing in the menu.  I had their new dish; silver needle noodle with shrimp, BBQ pork and eggs.  Yummmy!!
Silver needle noodle is noodle made with rice flour. (not too many restaurants make this noodle) It is short. shaped like a needle and is in white semi-transparent color.  Their ice milk tea is rich.  Love their panna cotta!  I come here quite often tho, coz their food is really gooooood!"}
{"text":"I\"ve been to Phoenix a few times in the past. Usually I like coming here for breakfast. They have a wide variety of breakfast options available, but they do end at 11am so be sure your order is in before that time! I tried their Satay beef with vermicelli. I'ts pretty good, quite tasty, but nothing special in terms of flavour. They have a ham and egg plus pancake as an option. However, they don't serve syrup for you to put on ?! They give you honey instead, which is kinda hard, esp when our friend's kids were trying to dip it in honey and it was getting stuck. They need to serve syrup if they are going to serve pancakes. Milk tea and drinks were okay, nothing particularly good. They actually have some nice options at lunch/dinner too. There's a particular fried rice with shrimp/crab paste that is REALLY GOOD. All in all, just a regular chinese cafe, sometimes there's a lot of people so you have to wait for your table, but at least this location (bayview) has more seating than the woodbine location."}
{"text":"Over the past years, I have visited Phoenix many time and usually order snacks more than actual meal or I would get lunch set. Today I am quite disappointed st one of their lunch menu which is number 10(spaghetti with tomato sauce and beef? Atleast that's what I was told) my expectation is similar to bolognese sauce. Granted, it is on tomato sauce, and the beef were slices, I was expecting like ground beef but then again, the menu doesn't specify or the pictures doesn't show clearly either since it was a baked dish... anyways, the beef doesn't taste like beef, feels weird the texture, the sauce feels like pour off the can, atleast the pasta was al dente. As a pasta lover, I don't recommend this dish absolutely, get their dessert menu instead. 

On another note, this place ONLY take cash.... There's no sign of whatsoever outside or inside that days that, it is very inconvenient for new client or even not regular client to eat at this location, when I suggested them to put a sign they said there's a convenience store that can withdraw money.... With that said, they said most of their customer knows their cash only policy. Well, for ur new customer who doesn't know and don't carry cash, it is super inconvenient as those \"convenience store ATM\" could b charging u extra. Take suggestion and take action! 

They only received 2 stars base on the not so good experience. Their dessert and drinks aren't bad tho. Would I recommend this place? I'm unsure to be honest, if you have other option, go to other places before u hit this one up."}
{"text":"This is my usual lunch spot for consistent, Chinese \"Cha Chan Tang\" food.

Their Hainanese chicken with rice is amazing! For some reason, I would always try something else on their menu to find myself picking at my friend's Hainanese chicken every time.  It's juicy and flavourful, and the ginger / green onion sauce that it comes with compliments the dish perfectly.

I ordered the Fish Tofu noodle soup this time.  They make their fish tofu in house - it's basically minced pieces of fish and tofu, deep fried then boiled in the soup along with the noodles.  It's really good and I don't think you can get this anywhere else (I wish I could buy this at the supermarket to make at home!  The soup base itself is a big bland for the average person but I personally am okay with it."}
{"text":"The 3 starred rating assumes you know what to order, and what not to order.  Blunt and honest opinion: For entrees, stick with the Cantonese stir fries, beef brisket noodle soup and Hainanese Chicken (with or without rice).  Fried snacks and breakfasts are okay.  These are their best and consistent offerings.  The quality of the rest seem to fluctuate.

Services are effective and factual."}
{"text":"Food is okay but service has consistently been horrible! We have been here on several occasions and over many years but I finally had to give them a review. The server literally threw our dishes on the table and was very rude."}
{"text":"This is a Cha Chaan Tang, or Hong Kong style cafe. I've never been to Hong Kong to see what the authentic Cha Chaan Tangs taste like but I thought this place was pretty good. 

They have a huge variety of selections on the menu ranging from ramen, curry, rice and noodle dishes, even sandwiches. I would recommend getting pork chop rice with tomato sauce and cheese. I also enjoyed the Japanese style chicken on rice and the Malaysian curry, which throws quite a punch of spice.

Overall this is a great cafe to chill at with friends and I would definitely come again when I return to the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend who speaks Cantonese so I had pretty much zero interaction with the staff here. Place was busy but the turnover rate of tables is super high. Didn't take long to be seated. Menu is enormous. Ordered the spicy Malaysia lamb curry from their lunch combo menu and the iced HK style tea as my beverage. The HK tea is basically milk tea but they chill it rather than put ice in it so it doesn't water it down, the tea flavour is nice and strong and it isn't too sweet. Our food came really quickly but I really didn't care much for my dish. It wasn't that spicy, and the menu indicated it would be. Also (and I should have expected this) the lamb was chopped up with skin and in some cases hair still attached, bones and connective tissue found throughout the dish. I didn't mind that so much but there wasn't really a lot of clean meat to be had. The potatoes were stodgy and kinda gross. The rice and flavor of the curry was good, but yeah, I just don't think I ordered a good dish for my tastes. I'd be willing to go back and try something else. Bring cash or debit as they don't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"I was in the area and needed some lunch so a friend recommended this restaurant. I ordered the veggie pad Thai bc I thought it was a safe choice. I also ordered the veggie spring rolls. The pad Thai was dry and lacked flavour and literally had a few pieces of bell peppers and bean sprouts... That's it. The spring rolls were fresh and very good on the other hand. All in all I Wasn't impressed. The restaurant was dirty but the waitresses were nice to talk to which is why I'm giving it 3/5."}
{"text":"The food here is very good, the hk styled tea is much like the food in Hong Kong. The service is good as well. A lot like the usual food in hk."}
{"text":"Decent cha-chan-tang! HK Cafe. 

I'm American and foreign debit cards don't work here. Only interac visas... so if you're foreign, cash only! Prices are a little expensive for some basic food. 

Lots of options in Markham but I do appreciate that the restaurant itself is cleaner than most and quality of food is reliable."}
{"text":"Standard HK style cafe with a large variety of rice and noodle dishes and colourful desserts. However, nothing really stood out to me...

Environment:
Located around Steeles/Woodbine, Phoenix Restaurant is right around my neck of the woods, and the large intersection makes it easy for commuters to get to the restaurant as well. There are a good amount of free parking space at the plaza. There are some medical buildings that also share the parking space, but since they don't open for the weekend, I didn't have any problem with the parking situation. 
The restaurant itself is good sized, can accommodate larger groups by piecing the tables together. The space is nicely renovated with modern fixtures and was quite clean during my visit. There were some TVs that basically runs a customized channel similar to CP24 where you can check the weather, and it displays a range of their signature dishes. 

Food:
I remember coming here couple months back and wasn't very impressed with the food, but we decided to try again since the place is pretty close. I like how the menu is presented because they have lots of good quality pictures to show how the food will look like. There is also an official Instagram page for the restaurant that you can follow. If you flip to the back of the menu there are lunch specials, afternoon tea specials, and dinner specials, also accompanied by nice pictures. 
We went for the lunch and afternoon specials during our visit and ordered Black Sesame Thick Toast ($4.75), Smoked Duck Breast w/ Caramel Cointreau Sauce ($11), Japanese Curry Seafood Fried Rice ($10.50). The dishes also came with a free hot drink, but if you want to exchange for a cold drink it's $1.25, which is more expensive than comparable HK cafes. I opted for the cold original milk tea and it tasted very nice, I really enjoyed the rich tea flavour. 
We were quite disappointed with the Toast because it was literally a piece of think sliced break with some sesame jam slathered on top. The texture was too hard as well, definitely not worth it. The smoked duck breast that I got was pretty good, though I didn't quite like the tangy sweet-and-sour sauce. Surprisingly our favourite dish of the meal was the fried rice. It didn't look like much (so average looking that I didn't bother with taking a picture) but the flavour was really good and the portion was gigantic. The plate that they used to contain the fried rice was pretty much as wide as my body, so that's a good deal.  

Service:
Average Chinese restaurant service...don't expect anyone to come check up on how you're doing, but they will fulfill your request if you wave them down."}
{"text":"Took a beautiful girl here on a date. We enjoyed the venue and the food! She ordered the taiwanese chicken it was unbelievable! After eating we gulped down a couple of milk teas. They give you the option of adding sugar if you need to.

They let you hang around just to chat if you need to which was perfect. Will be back for the chicken with or without her. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Quick, hot hk style breakfast food. Scrambled eggs are ever so good. All their combos are under $10 and value-laden with many varieties available. Service is quick and customer oriented. This particular chain is bigger than the others and has several booths available. Nice to drop in before work in the mornings."}
{"text":"Pretty standard HK-style restaurant with modern decor and decent food. I just have two complaints with my visit to the place

1) I asked to substitute ho fun instead of chow mein. They refused this outright because the chow mein was part of some sort of combo that includes a drink. I am not accustomed to this type of inflexibility at a Chinese restaurant and I don't understand how being a part of a combo has anything to do with it. I would have been willing to pay a surcharge if that's what it took to get the substitution - I much prefer the ho fun. As a result of this refusal, my meal was just \"Meh\".

2) My friend's chicken dish had a strange flavour to it, as if the chicken was not really fresh. We brought this up with the waiter, whose best resolution was to either remake the dish or to make something else. As far as Chinese restaurants go, this is a pretty typical way of handling it I suppose (no discount or anything given).

So to sum it all up, it looks like they have the stinginess of a typical Chinese restaurant without the flexibility of one."}
{"text":"We stopped here after shopping at the Dollarama next store one evening.

As a non-Chinese, I would probably describe it as a Chinese diner.  Brightly lit, bustling, and attentive and friendly diner style service.  The food was quite good though nothing seemed exceptional.  

Very long menu with lots of combo items.  As other reviewers have noted, the food style is Hong Kong Cantonese fort the most part."}
{"text":"This place has the best Hainanese chicken rice in GTA!  One of the most popular items on the menu, this dish is always consistent with the chicken made soft and tender.  One of the few asian restaurants in the area, this popular place specializes in HK style cafe food/drinks with a huge menu selection to choose from.  They serve a variety of breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack items.

Always busy, you may need to wait for a seat especially during the busy lunch hours.  Pricing is fair, and waiters are very quick and responsive.

I always at least get take out when I am in the area since this is one of the few good places to eat around the neighbourhood.  This is the original Phoenix Restaurant location and I found it to be better than the newer locations around GTA."}
{"text":"This place is great for a real taste of HK style food.  I have their curry ox tongue on rice and fried chicken steak on rice with tomato sauce on a regular basis.  This place is usually busy so expect to wait 5-20mins during lunch time.  Good value and good food."}
{"text":"Date:  Aug. 11/2013.

Ordered:
Hainanese chicken
Japanese fried rice
Shrimp/FAKE crab meat salad...really mashed potatoes.
Chicken wings
Malaysian ox-tongue w/ spaghetti
Shark/soup bone soup with wonton.
4 HK mil tea
1 coke

$100 with tip.

A definite carb meal all around.
All are to be ordered in a set meal either with rice or spaghetti.
The chicken wings were normally \"Chinese-crispy\" in taste.
The Hainanese chicken was delicious, so was the Japanese fried rice with its fake crab meat.
The mashed potato salad was so-so....with two shrimps and around 7 FAKE crab meat.
The Soup....don't order...not worth it.

Overall...just order the Hainanese chicken for take-out.
The others are good for lunch not dinner.

For $100, other Chinese restaurants can offer a more sumptuous meal with more variety (lobster, seafood, duck) included.

My trek continues.  Happy eating everyone."}
{"text":"The decor is modern and fairly clean. Despite some of the seats on the booths being outdated, as some of them were taped. However, that didn't bother me too much because I was there for the food. 
My friends and I stopped here for lunch and the 3 of us got the Hai Nan Chicken and Yunnan Noodle Soup with Beef Balls (we substituted the vermicelli for egg noodles) to share since the portions are quite large. As for the taste, the broth was above average, but everything else was just mediocre. Since it was lunch, we got a choice of 1 cup of coffee or tea to go with our meal. Unfortunately, the tea was completely too dark for my liking. I've also tried the coffee on another visit and it was equally undrinkable. 
Service was a bit slow due to it being a lunch rush."}
{"text":"This place has it all. Korean Food, Chinese Food, breakfast type food, desserts, the list goes on. French toast with carnation milk is a must try. Don't try to replicate it at home. It will never come out the same as this place does it. Trust me I've tried. Firstly the bread they use is super thick and huge like its meant for giant people. Secondly this place doesn't hold back on the fatty ingredients. When you try to make it yourself you always put less butter, less carnation milk because we think that we are eating more healthy when we put less. And for some reason mine always get burnt. So I've learned my lesson when trying to replicate their French toast. Just get it here and worry about the pounds that you will put on later. Also had the cream sauce spaghetti with mushrooms and also corn cream sauce with fried fish for lunch. Portions were filling but got bored of the taste quickly. Probably because of the French toast. Their cold milk tea was amazing as usual. I could drink that stuff all day, especially on a hot summers day."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot but haven't come back until lately. The food is good, hk cafe style with yummy food. Wait for food can take a while esp if busy but it is worth it. The fried pork chop is fried to perfection, moist and nice panko crust on it. The chicken rice dish is amazing as well as a variety of items of dessert they serve.  Good Chinese food for Markham"}
{"text":"Standard HK Cafe food (which means making everything under the sun) at a tiny bit over normal HK Cafe price. But not a big deal.

Get the Hainanese chicken for sure, the chicken/pork cutlets are also okay."}
{"text":"I was here with my boyfriend on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was surprisingly packed, though we didn't have to wait for a table. 

The fried udon that we ordered was good, but the silver needle noodles that we also ordered were kind of plain. Dishes were also quite small for the price.

If Phoenix was on the way to somewhere I had to go then sure, I'd eat here. Other than that, no."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good option when I'm looking for something quick and simple, they've got a ton of options and they do them pretty well. I like their HK-style noodle soup, more specifically their satay beef one, with instant noodles. 

But their afternoon tea sets are pretty good too, and they come with a drink for under $8 before tax. My mom likes their fried fish fillets with potatoes salad, which is freshly fried and not too overly breaded and served with a huge scoop of potato salad and a dollop of mayo(?) but I usually put  pool of vinegar to dip the fish in.

Their desserts are pretty good, not spectacular but pretty good. I especially like their black sesame napoleon dessert, which is puff pastry and black sesame ice cream with whipped cream and strawberries... yumm!"}
{"text":"The good: one of my go to places whenever I am craving for Chinese food. Their hanain chicken is the best I have ever tried. Their Phoenix (red and white sauce) fried pork/chicken baked dish is sooooo good. And if you order a combo, their milk tea is one of the better ones I tried! As a plus, their desserts aren't too shabby too.

The bad: I must say I wasn't a fan of their hk waffle savoury dish (I ordered the shredded beef version). It was soft, more like over baked, thus making it too hard to chew.

The ugly: not much bad things to say about here.

Neutral: great for groups, one dish will fill you up. Price is fair."}
{"text":"At first I didn't know what this place was. I always drove by it or I'm beside it because my bank is there. So one night my Gf and I decided to go try it because we've seen multiple restaurants and thought why not. 

Now I'm done for cheap, large portion foods that taste good and oh my. This place reminds me of one of those restaurants where you get all day breakfast noodles or garupa cutlets. Hell yea this place was the similar! We both ordered the noodles. She got Satay beef I got chicken steak and hmm so nice! We also ordered the chicken wings and they are definitely HK style, but the taste was a so so for me. We tried the napoleon ice cream sandwich (I think that's what it's called...). The  pastry was so fluffy, whip cream, strawberries, ice cream AND chocolate syrup oh my god. 

The prices are relatively cheap. The cold HK style tea though 3.50 seems a bit much compared to some other places.. Aside from that though this place isn't that bad! Definitely come back to try the lunch combos!"}
{"text":"Phoenix is a Hong Kong cafe that has been around for as long as I've visited Toronto. It's lasted at least for 10 years, which is quite a long time given how restaurants can come ago in the Greater Toronto area. As with many HK cafes, Phoenix has a very large menu with a wide array of various options, which can vary depending on the time of day. They serve snacks, meals, desserts, and everything in between. 

This time around, I got the deep fried pork cutlet with tomato sauce and rice, which was solid as far as HK cafes go. I can't say it's the best HK cafe I've ever been to, but it definitely captures the essence of flavors I might expect from a Hong Kong cafe. The waffles and HK French Toast are also very solid. This is the type of HK cafe that just is solid all around, with nothing being disappointing but nothing that stands out either. Great place to go if you are missing the HK cafe experience and you happen to be in the Markham area."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice and both times I ordered their fried rice. Their fried rice is really really good. It has flavour, but the only thing I didn't like was that it was too oily and the shredded lettuce don't belong in this dish. Decor is nice and the place was packed both times I got there, but wait time was not bad. Staff were quite attentive too."}
{"text":"I think there's about five reviews already about the Hainanese chicken rice, so I'll focus on the other stuff.

This place is extremely busy as it is the only Chinese-style cafe in a radius of about 1km. Expect wait times pretty much throughout the day, especially during lunch on weekdays as it's near Markville Secondary (popular high school students hangout place, lucky them!), and definitely during breakfast on weekends.

Their milk tea is probably one of their highlights when it comes to drinks, lovely taste and they don't even use ice!

I usually order the seafood macaroni with cream sauce and cheese if I go for tea time, otherwise I go for the clam spaghetti; both are very good. Maybe the only negative thing about it is the sauce in both cases are a little watered down, but it's somewhat of a break from fattening cheeses and cream sauces I'm used to in other cafes.

They also have a \"western\" style of waiting for a table. Instead of giving you a number if all tables are full, they ask you for your last name. I find that a bit more respectful as you'd be referred to your name instead of a number.

Consistency is what matters, and this place delivers it."}
{"text":"I was in the area and wanted breakfast, and seeing how the Phoenix I usually go to is across town, I went to this one instead. This is the second time I've been here, as the first time was years back when it first opened.

I had the usual: Fried mini-steak with udon, while my grandma had the satay beef rice noodle. Overall the food was okay, but we find the flagship location better in terms of quality. The milk tea was also decent, however the iced lemon tea lacked in sugar...it was so sour I barely finished it without holding my nose.

Service was typical for a place like this, which is pretty much \"don't expect much\" for the amount you pay.

Decor is quite nice here though! However it creates a somewhat noisier environment compared to the McCowan location."}
{"text":"Usually never expect good service for causal Hong Kong style restaurant.  But yesterday experienced the worst!  The way they approach customers, throwing menu on the table, dirty washroom, fly everywhere, sharing table,  and much more!  
My next table got some change back from cashier by mistake which he didn't even pay or finished lunch yet!  How massy is the service!?
How much is a piece of napkin worth?  Waitress will give u the cheapest poor quality napkin if u ask for extra napkin.  
Sorry!  Don't feel like to waste time to write about this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food is just so so, comparing to City Hollywood Restaurant in Market Village. Price is not that cheap. But the good thing is they have various desserts which look so good!"}
{"text":"Price increased and my gf said her winter melon noodle soup, the winter melons were sour which they turned bad. Price increased and lower quality of food...
We will never go there again..."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage...don't come to this place.  We came for lunch during work and ordered our food and waited for over 30 minutes and no food came out.  Apparently they forgot our order and no apologies.  Food tastes ok but definitely not worth the wait.  Poor customer service and i was late going back to the office.  Thanks for a miserable experience Phoenix restaurant!"}
{"text":"The Phoenix is a place you'd only go to if you were looking for poor service, queues, or if there was no where that you wanted lunch at and it was close by. 

Incredibly poor service with attitude. The food has taken an exponential dip in quality per year. 

Parking is difficult and quite the battle with other patrons in the plaza.

Only redeeming item is the Hainanese chicken, which is alright. 

1/5 would try not to return."}
{"text":"Tasty Hong Kong style food, but a bit pricey. The milk tea, and the milk tea mix coffee is a must to drink because they do make it good."}
{"text":"Stopped in here twice while attending a sci-fi convention at the Holiday Inn next door. 

Both times the service was super fast, and I got food within ten minutes. The first time I ate in with a group and the second time I got takeout. The decor is airy, modern and a bit trendy. Very bright and clean and pleasant place to eat. The clientele is mostly young Chinese folks. (My husband and I were the only white people I saw in there all weekend.) I looked over there two other times during the weekend and decided it was too crowded to go in. At 8 pm on Saturday there was a lineup out the door. 

The menu is huge and has everything from stir fries over steamed rice to Chineseified western food (think ten different variations on hamburgers or spaghetti, or creative toppings for toast). I was tempted by but skipped the bubble tea, and also the special coffee drinks that appeared to have slices of cake wedged in the top of the glass.

I ordered fried egg noodles both times. Could have been more creative, but I love those noodles, and I haven't found anything in Buffalo to cool off my craving for Toronto Chinese food.  The Cantonese fried noodles are loaded with meat, seafood, and mushrooms. The shrimp and scallops were perfect, the crabstick was a bit mushy and the squid a little too chewy. The barbecue pork was awesome. The rest of my party enjoyed Malaysian-style curry, ox tongue soup, and shrimp dumpling soup. 

You don't need to speak Cantonese, there always seems to be at least one person working who can speak English. They take plastic (maybe only debit) but only on orders over ten bucks."}
{"text":"First time at this location of Phoenix! As usual, lots of variety to choose from. Food came very quickly and I enjoyed the cold hk milk tea served in a cool cup instead of having ice cubes."}
{"text":"The curry chicken or curry lamb are good , same with Hainanese Chicken rice. A few of my friend don't like the curry cause the curry style are more south East Asian like Malaysian / Singaporean style with coconut  milk  in the curry.

Their fish soup noddles pretty good too so do Hong Kong styles bake (chicken/ Pork) rice. 

Lunch menu are awesome but dinner seem a little expensive consider the portion are the same as lunch but with higher price. 

Try to avoid the student crowed around noon to 1 pm. We usually there by 11.45 or later like 1.10pm.

The only draw back is parking.  Staff service depend on her mood or month of the day. Sometimes I got excellent service and sometimes I got sour face service ( I based on gut feeling and observation )"}
{"text":"Too expensive for their taste and portion.  Only will go if other people forces me.  Only exist because of the rich high school students next door."}
{"text":"Staff didnt check on us, food was So-so. 

Squid/Fish Balls were a tasty appetizer. 

We weren't given the option for dessert. Server walked up, told us register was closing so they were billing us now. (This was as we were finishing our dinner, and wasn't 10PM yet) They did this to everyone there at the time, but it would've been nice to have at least been asked if we wanted anything else. We had hot tea and hot food in a warm restaurant, and would've gladly sprung for something cold.

I had the Malaysian Ox-Tongue Curry, my wife had the Malaysian Chicken Curry. Both were decent."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is.   I've been coming to Phoenix for many years, but I felt that this past year, the freshness of the food has been going downwards.   

If you're coming for their signature dishes - the noodle soup ones or the chicken rice - then you're going to be ok.   Anything else besides that, it's usually a hit or miss.

Today, I had the baked cream sauce chicken and ham with spaghetti.  It was horrible.   A day old chicken thigh meat (I don't think you should use that for this dish - chicken breast would be better), and the ham wasn't the gourmet kinds, but the thin slices one - the cheap ones...  And worse of all, they just threw it on top of the spaghetti - so it tasted like they didn't put any thought into it - bland and tasteless.     For what this dish cost, it should have been better.  Maybe add a couple of green peas or carrots like it should be.   

I would only come here if I am desperate.  Better off to check out other HK style cafes around the area on Highway 7 area, if you have time.   

Gave it a two stars, because well, they have other better foods I've tried.  But really, Phoenix turned into a very AVERAGE restaurant.   I just feel the freshness and quality just isn't what it used to be anymore. The dish I had today actually deserves a \"no star.\""}
{"text":"I've been to 3-4 Phoenix Restaurants and they all have mediocre service. However, the food is good enough for me to come back. This location recently opened up so you're able to find a 30% off in the newspaper. They will also give you a 15% off with your bill at the end of the meal to lure you back!

I got the baked fish with corn sauce, the honey garlic baked rice and the curry ox tongue. Since it was a lunch special, we got two HK style tea and one lemon tea. All three dishes were done well but my favourite was the curry dish. It had the right amount of kick to it and it was very flavourful. 

I'll be coming back here as long as I can find those 30% off coupons!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at Phoenix Restaurants. I've been to the one on McCowan and Raymerville but I think the Woodbine and Steeles one is nicer and cleaner.

I do find the price a bit steeper than other Chinese restaurants but it's not ridiculously priced. If you order one of the combos, you can get a free drink (tea, coffee) with your meal.

I've tried their curry dishes and I really enjoyed them. I had fried noodles which was good too. I don't think I came cross many dishes that I didn't enjoy here. As well, the menu selection is huge so you're bound to find something you'll like

They also have awesome dessert here so make sure you check them out!"}
{"text":"As far as hong kong style restaurants go phoenix is very stable in terms of quality and service. I am not a huge fan of their pasta dishes but their rice/noodles are great. I love the spicy beef brisket noodles. It has a good amount of heat and you can taste the mandarin peel, star anise and other spices in the soup. I love how there's some carrots to balance out the heat."}
{"text":"Red bean drink with crushed ice. Great. 

Hong Kong style milk tea. Awesome and better than most.

Condensed milk toast. Holy cow, I thought they made a butter sandwich!

Not particularly healthy food but if you're seeking Hong Kong style cafe, this is a pretty good spot. Very clean interior, decent service, comfortable seating and air conditioning."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Phoenix in over a year as it never crosses my mind. We came here for lunch and they offer a large selection of all day combos as well as lunch combos (includes a hot beverage).

The food was great, presentation was alright as well. The servers are very quick and attentive as they gave us bowls for sharing our meals and plates to split the dessert (without us having to ask for them)."}
{"text":"Use to come here a lot, but with the, in my opinion, unnecessary price increase, I may come less. Their service and food quality also seems to have gotten a bit worse than before... I've posted up their more popular menu pages showing the price increases."}
{"text":"Like this place! Going there once a week with my boyfriend! Tasty food and affordable prices."}
{"text":"Ordered the crab and prawn salad, hainan chicken rice and chicken milanesa rice +egg. I didnt really like the hainan chicken rice but to be fair I never really liked the dish that much. The ice tea dn the hong kong style coffee were good speacially with their fresh pinapple bun. The main dishes were so so. The service was fast. Sadly they only take cash or debit."}
{"text":"Food quality is below average and it's very overpriced. I would of given 3 stars but just the way they try to dodge the tax system really irked me. I was given a receipt where the HST number was deliberately torn off. As I thought this was a one time incident however my friends also came across the same situations and was only given a proper receipt when they ask the cashier. These are not the type of restaurants we should support: the ones that cheat the Canadian Tax system. 
Conclusion: Never going back."}
{"text":"I came to this location around 9pm for dinner. My wife and I order two fried rice for dinner. The restaurant is not busy at that time. I have been waiting for 20min to get my order ready. When the fried rice comes to the table, both fried rice are barely warm at all and lack of any taste. I only had few bites then I just give up and get the bill. The waitress communicated with us to understand the issue but she just said this is the problem of the kitchen that she are not responsible for that nor she can do anything. The bill for this dinner is around $30 for some cold fried rice. I don't think I will give future business to this chain."}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant 2 or 3 times a year for brunch.

Your typical Hong Kong style cafe. 

Service is really quick and food is reliable.

This place is well staffed, menu is simple and menu items are familiar for this type of restaurant.

Brunch is usually $20 for 2 people.

Today, we ordered 2 brunch/ breakfast combos.

2 eggs, 2 slices of ham, 3 small pancakes
&
Beef Satay Vermicelli with 2 pieces of toast

$16.95 not including tip - included 2 breakfast drinks.

Food quality was legit.

Milk tea here is really good.

Would recommend this place for a quick breakfast, brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"We go to Phoenix restaurant quite often since the food reminds my wife of the food she used to eat back in Hong Kong.  Me, being French Canadian, I've tried and discovered different food.  Always pleased with the food.  The portions are also generous and I sometimes bring food back home. Yesterday I had the fish filet with black bean sauce.  Everything was well cooked and the sauce was just right ( not too strong or too bland).  My wife had the baked pork chop on rice with tomato sauce.  It looked good but did not have a chance to try it.
Total price was under 20$ for 2 people plus they give you a 10% discount for your next visit."}
{"text":"2.5-3*

I've been here a coupla times while I was training in the area and it's your standard Chinese diner.

You're seated quickly, you order, food arrives quickly, you eat (and not really enjoy), you pay, & then you leave.  No frills service.

Since this is the case, just stick to the standards so that you're not disappointed.  You can have a meal for under $10...and still have leftovers."}
{"text":"Best hainan chicken ever? boohoo. When I bit into the first piece, It tasted like frozen chicken. For the price they charge they should be able to use fresh chicken. What a waste of money, a waste of time, and a total embarassment to the restaurant's name. The other food we ate, average not much to talk about or blaze around the news. Probably the most expensive and tiny portion food ever. They are supposed to be known for the hainan chicken. Now I know it is overrated. Not alot of bang for that buck! Never gonna be back."}
{"text":"Love coming here for their Hoinan chicken with rice.  Probably the place to go in the Markham/Richmond Hill area for it.

They also make a REALLY heavy ice cream on thick toast dessert.  It can definitely serve as a meal on it's own.

Everything on the menu is reasonably priced and they have a large variety of dishes."}
{"text":"Came here because we were craving some Hainanese Chicken Rice. 
I will admit I am somewhat biased because I've had plenty of chicken rice in Singapore and to no surprise, this didn't quite measure up to it. 
All else aside, it was still well prepared. The broth was pleasant, the chicken was juicy, and I really liked the ginger sauce which I don't normally have. All in all, it was a fairly decent chicken rice and enough to get that quick fix we were looking for. 
Their menu looked incredibly extensive and I'd love to come back and try their other stuff."}
{"text":"This place does an excellent job living up to heightened standards for Hong Kong cafes in Toronto. That's probably why the general public is quite agreeable with adding to their success - resulting in them opening a lot more pop up shops. When I think of Hong Kong cafes in Toronto that are common, generally in every district there almost always seems to be a Phoenix.

What makes them so great is their unique approach to trying to perfect a dish or not trying to make it done by complacent standards like some other places may actually do. What made me want to write a review that conveys this place so highly was their pork cutlet breaded in oats with bonito flakes that I had gotten as a combo special with their complementary HK milk tea. There are not many dishes that were so accurate in heightening my overall standards of what I was gonna expect from it. Don't get me wrong though.. I feel like there are some missing variables that could add value to some of their other dishes, but this 1 has been an exception to that standard. 

At 1st I was hesitant towards giving them a 5.. but because of all the other missing variables on the other dishes I am reluctant to give them a 4. I suggest this dish occassionally however as it can be quite a bit to take in at 1 instance. For me this dish will only be good if I'm really feeling it. Unfortunately that nauseous feeling you get from eating too sinks in and makes it harder for you to want things too often regardless of how good it may have been.

Oh yeah and my counterparty got a Malaysian curry, the Cantonese way of making those thin slivers of beef I am not a fan of since its chewer and not that good to me so I would look down on this dish, but I did find that the seasoning/flavor was quite decent though."}
{"text":"This place is a great HK style breakfast diner. Great specials and they often offer discounts for future returns. Hainanese chicken is one of the best here and pretty decent value. Honestly I've been here probably 20 times in my life and never had a bad meal..........except the one time I got food poisoning and never been back since."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!

They go above and beyond (most of the time) which is more than I can say about ANY Chinese resto :P

I'm often dining w/an infant a la Bugaboo Stroller and so wider pathways are my preference!  Last time we were there, they seated us towards the back with ample Bugaboo space!

My favourite is also their crazy HUGE toast w/ice cream!  Their milktea is pretty good too - but beware if you guys like it with ice!  They've premade it in such a way that its optimal as is (chilled in a frozen glass).  They'll tell you adding ice to it will make it less authentic :P"}
{"text":"The servers are \"neighbour\" friendly, and easy to work with, the place is always busy around \"prime time\" as seating is limited. Food are reasonably priced and good, especially their Hoinan Chicken Rice. Food comes fairly quickly, and in the odd case it does not, a quick check with the servers will get food out fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Consistently good food (even across the other 3 stores) 
- Service is quick.
- One of my go-to HK cafés. 

Con:
- Pricier than other HK cafés. 
- Long line ups. 
- High school kids gets rowdy during weekday lunches. 

Summary:
Their milk tea is chilled instead of iced to prevent it from diluting. My favourite dishes are the fish broth noodles, curry, and the baked chicken steak rice with tomato sauce and fried egg. Their fried rices are really good also. Overall, this place is great, makes me feel like I'm in HK (that home-y feel), and I've been going here for years; I Would recommend all Phoenix Restaurants."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Markham, I always find time to come here for their Hainan Chicken with rice. Although I don't care much about the soup that comes with the meal, the chicken is deboned, tender and juice. The flavor is amazing. That's why I keep coming back. There is usually a line up waiting for a table, but I never had to wait too long. Today (Sunday), we arrived at 1pm and got a table around 1:15pm. Food arrived quickly so we didn't have to wait for long."}
{"text":"Yelpers posted that Hanian Chicken was the house specialty here. Yelpers sure didn't disappoint!

Hainan Chicken
- Chicken was flavorful, tender and juicy
- Soup was rather bland
- Garlic Rice was tasty too!

Tip: Chicken can be requested boneless upon request!

...the chicken was a little on the salty side...maybe bring a bottle of water to drink afterwards? :)"}
{"text":"So this is the typical HK style restaurant. A bit on the pricey side compared to others around town. U pay a bit more for nicer plates and better decor. The staff is really cool too. After my many years here the best bet is the afternoon tea combo of chicken leg salad. It's the best chicken leg in town."}
{"text":"Because I am of Korean background, when I step into the restaurant, they just assume I'm Chinese and start talking to me in canto/mand.
After multiple times of visiting, it's starting to get on my nerves which I thought was the only downfall to this restaurant. I've had occasions where they had to change me and my friend's server many times until they got one that could understand English.

Other than that \"problem\", the food is very fast, delicious and has big portions for the price!
Very well worth it and will be one of my top Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"This place use to be okay.  Recently went there for breakfast for the first time....no...can't...just too terrible...high prices for carbs in MSG.  I was thinking how good a sausage and egg Mcmuffin would be.  Fool me once etc."}
{"text":"This is my go to HK cafe for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Fast service is always appreciated when you're hungry and is in a rush. The fish soup noodle is my absolute favourite because the flavours are rich without feeling too heavy. I always order a pineapple bun with butter as well."}
{"text":"Feel like all the dishes they have is the same taste. A lot of varieties with decent price. I love their desert very well.. the boat one with scoops of ice creams very tasty. Good for a quick lunch and dinner. Service is somewhat good I guess. One time I feel their Waitress cant speak either Chinese or English well. So really hard to communicate. The speed for food is pretty fast. And it's packed all the time. Will recommend for a quick meal but not fancy one"}
{"text":"Come here pretty often since the food comes really quickly and it's pretty good for a Cha Cheng Teng (HK Style Restaurant). Their service is pretty good and have a great variety of food that they serve from tea sets, to ice cream, to all day breakfast, they have mostly anything you want and need from a HK style restaurant."}
{"text":"this is my go-to place for ??? food! 
cheap nice and fast with decent food 

really couldn't think of anything to say about it so I'll talk about the food. personally i prefer my corned beef egg sandwich with corned beef and egg separated but they mixed it and it still tastes pretty good"}
{"text":"It's most expensive than I expected but it's close by and great if you wanted to have some Hong Kong cafe style food! I like the space and privacy at the restaurant (not like some packed hk style cafes)!"}
{"text":"Love the beautiful Christmas decorations in here! So festive  love a restaurant with lots of festive spirit!  Decent HK cafe style food, not the cheapest but wasn't super expensive. First time at this location."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a while, but now decided to write a review. This place is very popular because the food is reasonably priced and is generally very delicious. The service here leaves a bit to be desired, but the restaurant was packed during the lunch hours. Food took a very long time to come out (everyone at my table already finished eating before I even got my food), so I would recommend going during less busy hours."}
{"text":"I had a short lunch break in between meetings so I decided to pop in to check this place out. 

At first glance of the menu, I was overwhelmed by pages and pages of food items. My second thought was, it's a bit pricey.  Given the area, you can easily find lunch menus at $6.99 but everything on this menu was over $9.99 with majority dishes above $12.99.  After a good 5mins, I've finally decided to go with the Malaysian curry chicken. When it arrived, I thought to myself, that is one sad looking dish. All it had was a few chunks of chicken breast and 3 pieces of semi-cooked potatoes with rice. No greens, no veggies, nada. Just straight up carbs and protein. I know better to never judge a book by its cover but after the first bite, I'm judging alright and it was not good. Maybe I ordered the wrong dish or something but I was definitely not impressed. 

Other than that, the service was good and it's a very clean place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Very reliable and consistent HK style Chinese food. Exactly what you'd expect from the other franchises. Good variety of savory food and desserts. Relaxing and comfortable ambience to enjoy your food."}
{"text":"New change in management recently. I went in with my boyfriend and sat down the same time as the girls next to us. We ordered at the same time as well. 

I ordered the ham sausage and egg with tomato sauce for lunch and my boyfriend ordered the baked chicken with tomato sauce and egg on top. 

You would think that the non-baked item would come first right? No. The baked item came about 15 minutes after we sat down and the non-baked item came about 20 minutes after that. That wasn't the worst part. Every table around us was the same. Only one item came first and the next one came after the other person already finished eating their dish. Its horrible ! To add on to that, the girls next to us didn't get their food until I was almost done my non-baked dish.. Which, I'd say, is about 45 minutes wait. 

If you ever want a quick lunch, I wouldn't recommend going."}
{"text":"Food Quality is great.

My favourite would be their vermicelli noodle in the shark fin bone soup, also their well known Malaysian curry, perfect spice + a well made naan.

Service is not superb, their milk tea is also made without ice, very rich."}
{"text":"Another Hong Kong style café and I am giving this place 4 stars because of a great breakfast I had there recently. The café itself is clean, inviting and has a modern décor and even on a cold Tuesday morning was packed.
We ordered a chicken fried steak that came with 2 eggs, a small salad and a sweet sticky bun. The chicken steak was a little greasy but flavourful and the eggs went well with the bun. Service was good, but not great, and the price for two full breakfast with hot lemon teas came up to $14.00 including taxes and a tip. I enjoyed this place a lot more than I did B and B which is just down the street from here. I will definitely come back again here :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and I always come here for a quick lunch with my parents or with some of my friends that live around here. This place is so tasty and the value is unbeatable. If you ever have trouble deciding what to eat for lunch and don't want to spend $20 a meal but at the same time want something yummy and quick, you should definitely come here!

The place is decorated very nicely with white chairs and very urban like decor. This place  is very popular especially during lunch time so you might have to wait a bit. However, the best part is that chinese people don't like sitting down and talking for hours on end, they just sit down, eat, and leave so you won't have to wait too long. The service here is surprisingly friendly and not rude like a LOT of chinese places are. They take your order fast, they refill your tea and they get the job done.

Now the reason why this place is so popular and are always full of people is because of one main thing. The menu is CHEAP. The menu is very straight forward and almost everything on there is delicious. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BAKED RICE here. Especially the baked pork cutlet with tomato sauce and cheese, ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. Now I am not saying this place is a restaurant you should bring your girlfriend on your first date or a place to eat on a friday night as a special event, but if you ever have a chance to eat here for lunch or want a quick meal for cheap, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO.

You might think I'm a bit biased because I'm Chinese but this place is definitely a place to go when you are low on cash and just want a quick delicious meal. The food here is not traditional chinese food, it is essentially HK style food (there is a difference!) and let me tell you, it is the perfect meal to eat for lunch. If you are around the area and want a meal without spending a lot, definitely come here."}
{"text":"Tbh, tried the hainanese chicken rice and I thought it wasnt anything special... It was soft though. 

But still a good cha cha tang! Service good. Prices fair for their portions. The desserts look ah-mazing! Happy camper. (:"}
{"text":"Great quality food but pricing is relatively more expensive compared to the other chinese \"western\" style cafes. Lots of unique selections and always new things on their menu."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday with my family during breakfast hour before 11:30AM. They do specials for breakfast so that's probably why it was pretty busy. 

I was holding my baby and walked up to the waitress asking to be seated, not only did we not get seated but they made us wait for a while so we ended up seating ourselves. 

The food was mediocre and not worth the money. We ended up spending 50 dollars on 5 simple easy breakfast meals. Since the service wasn't impressive we really weren't that happy with the restaurant. Would I go back? Probably not"}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner and got immediately seated. I ordered the Hainan Chicken with rice and liked it. Hubs ordered the fish balls with noodle soup and liked it. Daughter ordered the Grouper with Curry. She thought it was very spicy. Service was a bit uneven. My chicken with rice and the fish balls with noodle soup came out pretty quick. But, the Grouper with Curry took a while to come out.I thought that they forgot to put the order in. Service was efficient. Not sure what was great about it after reading the rave reviews on this place. After coming here, I realize that I'm not a big fan of Hong Kong style fusion cooking."}
{"text":"This place is not worth going, bad service, and why Japanese style fries= fries+mayo? Holy... And f up our order when we ask for \"add an egg pls\"..."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast selections.  The satay beef is perfect.  The milk tea is extremely smooth.  The thick toast is just perfect.  A must do if you love Hong Kong style breakfast."}
{"text":"Of all the Phoenix locations, this is probably the worst one. I ordered porkchop vermicelli soup noodles and not only was the presentation was bad, but there was only one piece of porkchop which half of it was bones and fat. The vermicelli was soaked in the soup too long making the texture of the noodles mushy. My meal wasn't even hot, clearly it was probably premade and leftover from the breakfast rush.

I came here because they opened a new location closer to me and thinking the quality of the food would be consistent as the other locations. This was a bad assumption. I wouldn't come to this location."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better Hainanese Chicken places in the GTA, nothing else worth mentioning though, service, cleanliness, and menu options are very lacking compared to elsewhere."}
{"text":"I would rate their food 4/5. It really depends on what you order. I order the same thing everytime - hoi nam chicken rice. This is by far the best hoi nam chicken rice I can find in Toronto. Please let me know if you have better recommendation :) Their deserts are pretty good too. Why do I give it a 3? because I find other food on their menu is really soso..also, it's a bit pricey when comparing to other hk style restaurants."}
{"text":"Very busy place. I like their honey garlic chicken with rice.  You might find the servers pretty impatient at times.  Just a heads up."}
{"text":"typical hk style restaurant. you get consistency as a franchised business over the mom and pops ones i suppose."}
{"text":"Tasty, fast and decently priced.

My usual order is the Fried Chicken Steak with Black Pepper Sauce, which comes with a side of rice and a medley of diced carrots, corn and peas.

I would've preferred some sort of Chinese vegeta.ble (as the medley screams frozen in my head) but there's very little of it that I'm not too picky about it.

The chicken steak and black pepper sauce won me over: savoury, and slightly crispy where the sauce hasn't covered the meat.

If you're in the north east end and want a taste of Hong Kong, a trip of Phoenix Restaurant will satisfy your hunger."}
{"text":"Terrible service and okayish food. The waitresses DEMAND tip and are
completely rude to you g customers, especially those who don't speak Cantonese. I came here with my friends after exams around June and we all ordered items off the lunch menu. After the food arrived and we all got our drinks and paid for our meal, we had our receipt handed BACK to us and the waitress demanded a tip, even though we already tipped her. Apparently, we each had to individually tip her. She was clearly trying to take advantage of us, seeing as we weren't adults and some of us couldn't speak Chinese. We didn't want to make a scene, so we reluctantly tipped her. BUT THEN, she brought it back and demanded a higher tip. AND it was only to my friends who weren't Chinese, that she demanded a higher tip. We ended up tipping more than 10% for a mediocre meal (too sour for my taste, and the lemon water was bitter no matter how much sugar was added) and poor service. Apparently this is a common practice for waitresses at this restaurant. This is completely unethical and they are taking advantage of unsuspecting children and customers who don't speak Chinese. Don't bother going here if you're a teen or if you can't speak Cantonese, because they will try to charge you tip."}
{"text":"Phoenix is a decent place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, as they have multiple items on the menu as well as meal deals throughout the day. I usually come here for breakfast and have ordered a few of their items. 

During my most recent visit, I ordered the Chicken Steak with Instant Noodle. It comes with a hot drink (I asked for coffee). The instant noodles are cooked al dente, not too soggy but slightly undercooked so that it continues soaking up the broth. The broth is a chicken base soup that tastes like your standard issue MSG packet. The chicken is quite tender and you get a good portion size to the bowl. There are some frozen peas, corn, and carrots in it as well. For $7.50+tax and tip, it is pretty expensive for just instant noodles and some chicken (some places price it around $4.99). They had a promotion where it was buy one, get one half off, so certainly made it a bit more appealing. 

The coffee is meh, the aftertaste of the evaporated milk is a bit much and you don't feel the caffeine kick in."}
{"text":"Came here for takeout. They've had a takeout promotion for a while now (15% discount on takeout orders as long as you pay in cash). I ordered the honey BBQ pork jowl with egg on rice. They add a soya-base sauce to the rice and season the dish very well. You get a few slices of the pork jowl on the rice and a half-cooked egg. It's nice that you can cut the egg and let the yolk mix with the rice. However, on this occasion the yolk already burst and leaked everywhere before I had a chance to have my meal a while later. This dish came with a drink, which I ordered their HK style hot milk tea. It is creamy, sweet, and actually quite nice to have because none of the flavours were overpowering. There is a lot of room in this restaurant and mainly cater to students from a nearby high school during lunch and residents of the area during breakfast and dinner."}
{"text":"This use to be really good a few years back. Now it's just a restaurant you go to for a quick bite and just because it's close by. The food is doable for dinner. Is it special? Not really, is this something to try from out of town? Not really.

I have the fried ramen with ox touge. Nothing special nor something I recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant gives you classic dishes from an HK style cafe, plus some decadent-looking desserts. 

For the food itself, the Hainanese chicken with rice is a favourite - the chicken is silky smooth and flavourful, and it comes with 3 different dipping sauces. The rice is chicken-broth infused, so it's especially aromatic. But be warned - this does not come with a drink!

Their HK milk tea is STRONG, so I can't drink this stuff at night, unless I WANT to be up at all hours. By this virtue, my father is a huge fan of the tea, since it takes him way back to the HK homeland!

The desserts are quite impressive. I've tried the brick-style thick toast, and to say \"sharing is caring\" is an understatement. It's massive! The toast itself is covered in butter, so the mix of salty and sweet is quite appealing. AND it looks like a wrapped giftbox when it arrives! I've also tried the sesame ice cream pastry dessert, which comes in a tower of flakey pastry, sesame ice cream and more flakey pastry. Again, bring a friend to finish this one.

I've never noticed if the service was good or bad, but I would say prepare to have a certain amount of assertiveness if you want responsive service. It's just how it is at these establishments!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, super friendly service, relatively cheap food yet the quality still extremely good and the portions are ample. 

Extremely highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you like not getting an acknowledgment or a smile then this is your place. The restaurant where waiters/waitresses strive for your dissatisfaction.   

Food has gone downhill.  Their hainese chicken isn't the same as before. I don't know what they did to it but it's not the same. My parents from Vancouver can't stop complaining about it. I use to like it a lot. In fact that's the 1 of 2 things I get there."}
{"text":"This is probably the most consistent HK style cafe in the area, including all the other Phoenix locations. Nothing amazing but the food is consistently good and there is enough variety that there's something for everyone. It is pretty family friendly as well. My go-tos are usually the BBQ pork shoulder and fried egg with rice, satay beef with vermicelli, or the spicy fish filet with noodles in fish broth. Their cuttlefish ball noodle in fish broth used to be very popular but I am finding it increasingly bland compared to other places like Deer Garden. They have an afternoon tea menu which has the typical afternoon tea fried chicken leg/wings and HK style french toast which are all pretty good, plus a selection of their regular dishes at slightly discounted prices."}
{"text":"Your neighbourhood hong kong style cafe...
Menu is so extensive, you can eat something different everyday for a year!

Lunch specials just under 8$ includes a drink of your choice.
They have everything you can think of from curry, their famous \"hainan\" style chicken, fried rice, fried noodles, soupy noodles, saucy food over white rice, congee, baked rice, speghetti.. list goes on and on...

Prices are relatively low, as expected from hong kong style cafe. 

Portions for rice and noodle items are HUGE. You can probably get away with ordering only 2 things split between 3 people.."}
{"text":"The newest Pheonix Restaurant ?? just opened in Bridlewood Mall.

The menu is identical as the other 3 locations so if you are frequent customer like myself, you will feel right at home.

Breakfast, Lunch, Afternoon Tea and Dinner Special.

The interior is spacious and nicely decorated.

The patrons now is more a mix of ethnicity as there are definitely more non Asians mall shoppers giving Phoenix a try.

You can access the restaurant through the inside of the mall or direct access at the back right next to Metro."}
{"text":"Phoenix Restaurant might be a little boring for some. For me I find it is A-OK as there will never be any surprises and I always get good services and decent food.

Menu has not changed and the selections are the same as the other 2 locations. I can tell you even the fish soup noodles I ordered tasted identical to the other locations.

Boring......but reliable.... That make Phoenix a good choice for me when I don't feel like being adventurous and just want a quick bite!"}
{"text":"This is where I get my takeout all the time and that is at least once a week.

The food is always good, at least the ones I always order.

My favourite is the Korean spicy meat rice, any of the noodles in shark fin soups.

I would stay away from the pricey set dinner, they are not good values and not that tasty! I don't like their curry dishes as much as I found they put too much coconut paste in them.

My favourite drink here is the grass jello ice drink with icecream, but be warned not to drink that if you are on a diet! They put condensed milk as sweetener.... taste so good though!

BTW, if you go for lunch, this place is so busy, so prepare to wait!"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd location of the Sucessful Phoenix Restaurant which opened recently.

The menu and prices are the same as the other locations. Good food, fast/friendly services and reasonable prices!

The interior is nice and chic.

The place did get busy during lunch!

They accepts Cash only!"}
{"text":"Came here to try the chicken rice this time.
Not bad and very generous with the meat.
My usual order here is the curry ox tongue. It is very well done here.
I also like the prawn salad.

It gets crowded during lunch so be prepared to share a table!"}
{"text":"Love love love their Hong Kong style French toast! Don't forget to ask for peanut butter."}
{"text":"Came here for the hainan chicken, it's probably one of the best hainan chicken dishes around this area.. Or the country. The chicken is super moist and soft and I love the chicken oil rice.. Compliments it so well. I think one of the best parts it the sauce they have along with it. They have the normal garlic sauce and then this sweet tangy sauce. I love dipping the chicken in it. I never liked the soup that came with it, honestly I think it's overly oily and barely has any chicken taste to it. 

Their milk tea is pretty good but doesn't come as a combo with the chicken. Their curry is mediocre and pork neck dishes are super good. Some of their desserts like the condensed milk on toast is droooool worthy. 

This place is usually packed but I never had to wait longer than 10 minutes. This is a larger location and I believe there is a smaller one in scarbs."}
{"text":"This Hong Kong style cafe offers a wide variety of rice toppings, noodle soups, hotpots, snacks, and desserts that make it a go-to place for me and my kids on any too-lazy-to-cook lunch or dinner or if we want some nice variety with our snack/tea time.  Portions are large and the flavour wonderful enough to fill us up.  The price is notably cheaper for such serving which makes it more exciting. 

Its such a family oriented place yet quiet enough for a smooth dining experience.  Service is quick and very friendly and I love their anticipation for anything we need.  The elegant & whimsical forest-fairytale like interior and the toy and candy vending machines make every visit a little more interesting for the kids."}
{"text":"A great place for HK style eats that I go to all the time. All of the dishes are made with great quality and care. I recommend you make a reservation on weekends if you go because it gets really busy! One of the most commonly ordered dishes is the Hanan Chicken rice dish -- very fresh and tasty. I normally go for the cream and tomato sauce chicken steak rice as it is one of my all time favorites --(although you can get it at other HK style cafés, they make it very well!)"}
{"text":"This is my regular restaurant. If I can't think of what to eat, or no special preference, I will visit this place. Tip of the day, lunch time is always busy from 12:00pm, parking is a headache during lunch time, in the days with good weather I will park in the CIBC plaza, much more convenient. I like the Curry dishes, the HaiNan Chicken."}
{"text":"Service:
It varies from location to location, but overall it's fast and efficient. 

Ambiance:
It's cleaner than your typical HK Cafe, and it's usually packed. The cafe is where you go and grab a quick bite with your friends or family. It's usually pretty loud inside.

Food:
Their food is more to the expensive side compared to other HK cafes, but the quality and portion is there. The only thing I dislike is that a lot of the dishes doesn't come with a drink, where this is standard practice in most HK cafes. The extra $ they charge you for a cold drink is also more than usual."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Frankly, the food is pretty nice. The portion sizes are huge, the facilities are clean and well-kept, and it's just a very friendly place to dine with both family and friends. What i really dislike about this place, however, is how 95% of their dishes lack vegetables. Most dishes are composed of a nice big chunk of protein (pork cutlet, hainan chicken, beef, spareribs, fish) in the form of fried, baked, or steamed, accompanied by rice or noodles. If you want something with a good quantity of vegetables, you would have to order from the limited selection of vegetarian options (which are actually pretty good).

If you are a meat lover, and hate vegetables, this is most definitely the place for a good meal!"}
{"text":"It was the worst meal I've ever had in my life.  The food had zero flavour, fried rice was barely fried, service was bad, and the meat made me feel sick. Everything on the menu looked terrible."}
{"text":"...no stars... no! just no! 

I ordered the chicken steak and pork chop with gravy and spaghetti, paired with a cold Horlick.

my friend: hows the drink?
me: not good.
my friend: how's the food?
me: not good. 

leaving the restaurant, 
my friend: you only sipped on your drink twice.
me: yea, cuz it wasn't good. 

My horlick had large clumps of the drink solution floating at the top. 
The spaghetti was dry. 
The gravy sauce was bitter. 
The steaks were fat and uninviting. 

not good :("}
{"text":"Trying to determine a rating for Phoenix Restaurant truly tore me apart. On my first visit with family, I ordered their Hainanese Chicken Rice for dinner (as did the seniors with me). The food itself was good. The rice was flavourful without being overly salty, and their serving of chicken was generous compared to most other joints. 

Despite this, the waitress' attitude was outright disgusting. Their large serving of chicken meant my grandmother and great aunt could not finish their plates, and needed to pack the leftovers to go. First, our request for a takeout box was met with visible displeasure. When we politely asked for a bit of the chicken dipping sauce to go (it is a basic component of Hainanese chicken, after all), our waitress turned around and asked her boss whether we've \"already asked for other things\" - as if we were there to mooch off... Was one styrofoam box too much to ask for?!?

Hainanese chicken rice that is well made can be difficult to come by, and Phoenix Restaurant offers just that. The service was an absolute deal breaker, however. It will take a long while for me to give Phoenix Restaurant its second chance."}
{"text":"The prices went up dramatically. I would not recommend going there again.

The food quality overall is good, we usually come here for breakfast. My favourite option is the Satay Beef Vermceilli with Condensed Milk Toast. Recently they raised this to $7. I could get a whole lunch meal set for that price. The Milk tea is delicious. It is nice, strong and the aromas were all on point."}
{"text":"I love Phoenix! It's one of those pricier Chinese diners, but I think the price is reflected in the higher quality of the food. The service is quick and the food comes out quickly enough. 

I have several favourites here that I always order: Singaporean Chicken Rice (the chicken is so tender!), Malaysian curry (the sauce is to die for!), pork chop bun, fish fillet bun, and various baked rice (like the baked bacon gravy pork chop rice). I'm not a fan of their Hong Kong style spaghetti, however. 

They have pretty interesting desserts too. I like their fruity take on the panna cotta, but it always sells out. I've also tried their ice cream crepes, ice cream toast, and ice cream napoleon. They're all pretty good."}
{"text":"great hk style food. best hoinan chicken rice--rice is flavorful, chicken is tasty and tender; love the sour spicy sauce too, although the minced ginger seemed a bit on the salty side.  perfect hk style milk tea + coffee blend. and my table neighbor's malaysian curry looked wonderful as well.

from breakfast to tea sets to dinner to a la carte, there are sooooo many items on the menu, one can basically eat there 3 meals a day for a whole month without having to repeat a dish, seriously. they all sounded good on the menu, but not everything comes out the way you had expected it to. like, my bf (a newbie to hk style food) ordered a prawn salad w/tobiko & seaweed, thinking that should be quite japanese, but i forgot to tell him that's hk style salad that's made w/lots of cooked potatoes and mayo. the first couple bites were ok, until you realize the prawns were sliced in halves sideways and couldn't help but wonder why they're being so cheap. his pork chops in sweet corn sauce was ok, but not out of the world. he was surprised about the big portion, though, seeing two full slices of pork on the plate (and now he complains about not having enough rice). 

it was a good meal, after all. but lines can accumulate during peak hours. we waited about 15 minutes, arriving at about 1pm on a weekday. but the line comes and goes. there was no wait shortly after we sat down, and then there was a few people waiting again as we were leaving. so try your luck as you go."}
{"text":"Located in the Dollarama plaza, Phoenix Restaurant can easily be missed if you're not on the prowl for an HK cafe. We were looking for cheap eats and good food and Phoenix is aiiiiggghhhht. The price was a bit more expensive with dishes at the $10~ range than other HK cafes and the food was ok. One thing I liked was they were quite generous with their meats and I definitely got full from the meal. I ordered the pork cutlet with tomato sauce and rice (but I substituted it with spaghetti instead). This was not bad, but if you didn't eat it quickly it got soggy fast. 

One thing that was overwhelming was that there were toooooo many options. They had pages upon pages of at least 20 different options with slight differentiation's and it was crazy. At the end of the menu were the combos that comes with the HK Milk tea and such. That was the page we all ordered from as the other pages didn't come with the drink. 

Other misc. factors: The hk milk tea + coffee was pretty good. Very strong. Service was meh. Came to take our order, give us food, and never came back. Interior was nice and modern. 

In conclusion: for an HK cafe it was not bad, but it was not great. Would come again if I really wanted HK food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an inexpensive, quick and  satisfying meal, look no further! The restaurant has many different options, food ranges from Cantonese dishes, Thai and Malaysian curries, to desserts and waffles!

We ordered a black sesame fried rice, Cantonese fried noodles and a baked pork chop on rice. Overall was great! Good sized portions. If you have a small appetite?, I'd order a dish to share, otherwise you'll definitely have leftovers for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"Been holding off on reviewing this place hoping it was better.. but now it is time for the review. I have always heard about Phoenix and the popularity of this place but I never understood why. The price is expensive for the lack of food and quality you get. Looking at the couple of pictures that I have posted, you get one tablespoon or less of frozen veg, some small portion of meat, a bigger portion of rice and easily you are spending over $10 at a HK cafe. In fact it seems like the portion of veg is getting even smaller that last time I was there. Their club sandwich does come  with fries at the price  you are paying... compare to two pictures of chicken steak with black pepper sauce with rice dish, you get less veg and a much smaller chicken....

Their service is nothing outstanding in a good or bad way. 

The only good dish seems to be their Hoinam chicken rice dish. 

Would I come back after a few times? The answer is no...I think I can get more for the money at other HK cafe restaurant."}
{"text":"Recently i have been craving Hainanese Chinese Rice.  The big question is where can i find good ones.  Turns out Pheonix restaurant's version came close to my experience in Asia.  The clear broth that came with the dish was flavourful.  The boiled chicken pieces were plentiful and they were tender.  Two kinds of dip accompanied the chicken.   One was the traditional ginger sauce, and the other, a combination of ginger and chilli mix.  Finally the rice that was supposed to be cooked with chicken oil.  It was not shabby at all.  The fragrance and taste weren't as strong as i would like it to be, but it was ok.  My mamma said to make good chicken rice, we need good tasting fresh chicken.  But for now, i am content with Pheonix' Hainanese Chicken Rice."}
{"text":"Just chose a dish at random. Originally I was thinking of pad Thai but I didn't feel like having something spicy. I am presuming that the chilli icon means spicy. Though it was green so I wasn't entirely sure either.

Anyway I ended up ordering G18 which is shrimp on rice noodle with egg sauce. When I think about it at $9.50 this dish is kind of expensive especially since it is not part of the combo.
Flushing with water could not keep up with the added MSG content of the dish.

Considering that this dish likely had MSG based on the tingling sensation of my mouth. It wasn't really doing anything. It's like eating some Pringles in egg sauce form. They probably would've gotten a better dish of they didn't add MSG to the dish.

Service was a bit slow considering they had at least four staff and the restaurant wasn't even full.

The place has no free wifi advertised and Wind Mobile signal is bad considering their booth was just outside.  There's also a $2 service charge for debit under $10.

Anyway have to go home and flush the MSG out."}
{"text":"Ok just tried their Hainan Chicken here since someone told me about it.

Personally, I was quite disappointed, the chicken was excessively salty.  I could barely eat it.  I ordered their chicken oil rice as well which was meh, I should have just ordered the plain rice instead.

I also got their baked beef spaghetti with 50c extra for cheese.  It was so so, but I don't think worth the price.  I may as well just get it from Metrosquare Cafe which is closer.

Service was meh, no free wifi.  It is also out of the way from most things except for the Holiday Inn (in which I would recommend people to just go to Metrosquare Cafe instead)."}
{"text":"I will probably not find myself here again. It is all around an ok restaurant, but for being in Markham, I can say that there are much, much better restaurants around for probably a better price. 
It was very busy up to about two pm, and you would usually have to share tables (even with a family of four), which I really dislike. 
The food was okay... Dishes were small. 

We ordered four dishes:
The famous chicken oil rice dish which was ok, the soup was obviously msg with water and the chicken was decently fresh. However, having a weak stomach, my stomach automatically reacted to something bad about that dish. Not sure what it was, might be the sauce?
The Pad-Thai dish, that was over the top oily, you can see the left over oil in puddles on the plate, it was mediocre, but again this is a Chinese restaurant, I don't see how they can replicate Thai food well. It was ok as well.
The seafood fired with clear noodles. One word to describe this dish, tasteless. 
And lastly, the Malaysian fried rice, it was probably the saltiest dish I have ever had in my life. The chef obviously put a handful of too much sauce... We basically took that whole dish home and re-cooked it. 

Needless to say, I will not be back, and if I find myself back, I will try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Came for Sunday lunch with the parents and the place was full. The wait was not too bad as a few tables were getting ready to leave. The menu is intimidating, there's a huge variety to choose from. Not just the normal HK style diner food. There's food from different Asian countries. The service was average and didn't stand out. The desserts look very appealing but didn't order it because there was only enough room for lunch.

Ordered the duo steak (chicken and pork) combo, the combo just means it comes with a hot drink. Opted for spaghetti over the rice. Compared to other HK style diners, Phoenix is on the more expensive side. For similar prices, other places would offer soup and beverage. The dish arrived warm and was a bit smaller than expected. Taste was mediocre and nothing special.

Overall, wont be coming back unless the parents want to."}
{"text":"Yes!  Curry ox tongue!  Whenever we are in the area, it's a must!  Very nice and flavourful!  If you come during lunch hour, you can also opt for the lunch specials which include a drink.  However they don't have the ox-tongue included in their lunch specials, only beef or chicken.  

Only problem with this place is that they are very petty.  They put 2 cucumbers on the dish when it comes.  When I asked for 2 more slices as I like to have the cucumber with curry, it goes very well as it helps cool down the spice a little plus it's just some veggies on the side.  What's 2 slices of cucumber?!  How much does that cost? Well, they said they will have to charge me for 2 extra slices if I wanted that!!  What?!! Are you serious?  It's not even the money but the principle behind it.  Is that how you make your customers happy?!  On top of that, she was shouting her reply at the table.  She said, \"well if you want the 2 slices of cucumber you have to pay!\"  Wow!  It is really sad that they don't train their waitresses better.  No need to yell, just explain nicely.  

Their prices are on the average of $9-13 per plate.  This is what they call a Hong Kong style cafe, not cheap but not super expensive either.  This means that their dishes have a little Western influence in it, not entirely typical Chinese.  They have things like pancakes, shrimp salad, club sandwiches, baked spaghetti.   

Besides the experience of them wanting to charge for 2 slices of cucumber, we would still go back for their curry ox tongue and Hainanese chicken rice."}
{"text":"Disappointed in this location. The service was terrible, and the food isn't as good in the other locations. The Hainan Chicken Rice was still good though, but not as good as the other locations. 

We came at around 11:45am and they were still serving breakfast. They wouldn't put my Hainan chicken rice order in until exactly 12:00pm, which I find silly because they clearly would have started preparing it in the kitchen already. 

I'll stick to the location on McCowan..."}
{"text":"For some reason this location is not as good or as popular as the Raymerville location and the service definitely reflects that. While the food is just as good in some cases the service at this location is often times abysmal. From servers ignoring you to food orders being missed sometimes you just end up leaving a little agitated. 

Tho it is still the same food the parking and wait times are definitely better than the Raymerville location. Only reason it received a less star is due to its lack of service."}
{"text":"Who doesn't know Phoenix in the 905 area? I would say they are the A grade of HK Style Cafe's while they also cater to the afternoon tea crowd this place is rammed from morning to the late afternoon with people. Wait times here could at times exceed 15 minutes. Despite it being generally more expensive as they dont have set meals (including drinks) like their afternoon specials crowds still flock to this original location. Out of all the locations in the 905 the Raymerville location is definitely the most solid in terms of service and quality of food. On the menu you can't go wrong with anything, they are best known for their Hainan Chicken but I personally believe that their Baked items are a step above the rest especially their Ketchup Baked Chicken Steak Rice and their Teriyaki Chicken Steak Rice are definitely highly recommended by me. 

If you have a chance to try this place definitely give it a try as not everyone's taste is the same but no matter what there is always one dish that Phoenix has that you will have you coming back again and again. If you are looking for good eats Phoenix is the place just be prepared to wait for a parking spot as Phoenix customers fill up the lot to the point other shops need reserved spaces of their own. (yes its THAT popular)"}
{"text":"Nice space and well decorated. A wide variety of menu items to choose from. Not crowded around 5:30/6ish, dinner after work. Got Hainanese Chicken on rice and hot beef brisket rice noodle. Both were good and the portion was big. Also got bubble waffle with chocolate ice cream on top, it took a bit to come because it was just made after we ordered. Great experience, will come back."}
{"text":"Very casual HK type foods at a very cheap price.  Their breakfast is really great, they have the typical macaroni soup with eggs and ham for breakfast, instant noodles with pork chops and perfectly cut crustless egg and ham or tuna sandwiches on white bread.  You also get a drink, my mom loves the half coffee half tea (yuinyern) while I usually get the milktea.  You can also buy Chinese newspapers and read like most patrons do throughout your meal."}
