{"text":"The food here tastes like home. Very quaint and family run place. The sambar, the saffron-colored garlic chutney and filter coffee are amazing. They are open till 10pm on weekends."}
{"text":"I came her one night to have dessert and chai. Unfortunately they didn't have any dessert so I only had the chai. Which tasted ok. I definitely had better ones. Service was good. The lady was very nice."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall of joints wont score any points on decor, but what this place lacks in style, it makes up for in quality and price.  It's run by a couple from Madras and if you love South Indian Kerala/Tamil favorites that wont break your wallet, this is the joint for you.

Some of my favorites, are decoction coffee, also known as filter coffee, which is hard to find in North America period!, seafood kothu roti, paper dosa, and masala dosa.  Their mango lassi is also the bomb!"}
{"text":"There is a lot more Indian restaurants in Toronto area than there is in my hometown... and they are generally better. We were stuck in Ontario's capital suburbia for the weekend so we decided to go for some Dosa... which I haven't had since our trip to India four years ago.

The area is definitively ethnic with the small cheap boutiques on both sides of the street. Rent must be very cheap.

The place is small and look like a single person operation. She take the orders and go in the back to cook them. Their business seems mainly take out. If you decide to stay and eat in, just make sure you are not in a rush.

We had a mixed plate of appetisers that we shared. It was nice to have some idli (fermented rice cake) that you dip in tomato or coconut based sauces. It did also include a sambar (spicy vegetable soup) and another item (don't recall the name).

The main course was the Dosa. It was very fresh and tasty. Much bigger than those I had in India. It could have been my only plate and I would still have been quite full! I finished with a very nice masala chai. A good and cheap meal.

If you are around and feel for some nice south indian food at good price in a convivial but basic setting, do come!"}
{"text":"Authentic and yummy dosas without a doubt. Food is deliciously cooked, hot and tasty. This is a popular place among the locals and a delight to the Indian community. Bring your appetite and enjoy."}
{"text":"I was introduced to dosa a couple of years ago by a really good friend of mine, it was love at first bite (yes, I know that is a cheesy thing to say but seriously, love it!) I started out at the famous Guru Lukshmi, which was great but a little crowded for my taste. Even though we love dosa my friends and I were searching for something a little smaller but equally as good and ta-da! Found it! I usually get the paneer dosa, even though I am lactose intolerant..it's just worth it. It's light, crisp and oh, so good! I have also had idly from here and while it is not as good as the dosa, it is still really flavorful and wonderful. There isn't usually a lot of people inside the actual restaurant, as this place seems more of an order out kind-of deal but I always stay and enjoy the company of my guests. I have brought three different friends and even recommended Yarl Dosa Corner to some American friends who had never even heard of dosa. Everyone always raves about the food afterwards and that makes me really happy! The only complaint I have is that the volume of their television needs to be turned down a bit, it was really deafening the last time I came in."}
{"text":"I do enjoy Guru Lukshmi, but honestly, it's such a production to just be able to sit down and eat.  Even if you've made reservations, you still end up sitting at some vacant, former eatery next door in order to wait for a table.  Service is kind there, but then the owner - or whomever - smiles, looks at you, then looks at the door as soon as you've taken your last bite.  Needless to say, it's not an entirely pleasant experience.

In comes Yarl Dosa/Yarl Dosa Corner/Dosa Corner to the rescue!  I believe it's just called Yarl Dosa 'cause that's what their signage/menus say.

The atmosphere at Yarl Dosa is probably the direct opposite of Guru.  It's located along a strip of Kennedy S, in Brampton, where every other unit is some kinda South Indian or Caribbean eatery.  Due to the dim lighting, the place appears to be closed, but it's not.  No chandeliers to speak of.  And there are no crowds waiting for a table.  It was actually quite dead on a Wednesday evening.

Lucky for me, I ended up going with friends who are from Sri Lanka, so they were able to order stuff off the menu and explain to me what certain things were.  Menu are words only, some descriptions.

I ordered the Ghee Paper Masala Dosa which my friend requesting extra ghee for me.  Dunno why, but I think they thought that I'd like it.  It was a bit too greasy for me, not to the fault of the cooks, so I think I'd skip this next time.  Spicy potato was underneath the actual dosa.  Chutneys were lovely, especially the spicy one!

Other standouts include Daal Curry (usually I'm not a fan of daal), Mutton Chukka (off-menu), Paranthas (nice 'n flaky), dosas...sans the extra ghee, & freshly made Masala Tea (a bit too sugary as a regular order).  ;)

Next time you're in Brampton, do yourself a favour, and check this place out!"}
{"text":"I took my son here, for his first Dosa, about 2 weeks ago.  At first we weren't sure about the place.  It's small and not very upscale.  There was only one other family having lunch when we sat down.

We looked at the menu and while there were many choices, (at reasonable prices) we decided to ask the waitress for help.  The waitress was very friendly and when we asked her for her recommendation she suggested: Chicken Kotthu Parota and Onion Masala Dosa.

WOW, that's what I have to say.  My son and I were totally impressed.  The Parota was a first for me and it was so very tasty.  I'm glad we tried the Onion Masala Dosa as it was perfect.  My son and I scraped up every last bite.  Based on our lunch we ordered Chicken Biriyani to take home.  My son ate that for his lunch was said it was fantastic.

NOTE: about the prices, lots of food for what you pay!

We would go again and I would take my whole family!"}
