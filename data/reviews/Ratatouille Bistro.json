{"text":"Checked out Ratatouille Bistro in the Britannia Shopping Center.  Great French vibe.  Service was excellent and the food was very good.  The restaurant has a classic french style menu with escargot, clams, frogs legs etc.  There is a short but good wine list. 
We started with a couple of classics to see how well they prepared them. the clams in white wine sauce were extremely good as were the escargot. They could use a better bread though as the bread that was served wasn't as good as it could have been and wasn't great for mopping up the very flavorful sauces.   
For the mains we had the halibut and the daily special, a ragout.  Both again were full of flavour and were good sized portions.  Very much reminded me of my meals in France. 
Dessert was profiteroles and a creme brule.  Very well executed.  
The bistro has a very bistro feel to it, relaxed, friendly and welcoming.  
I will be back and I would highly recommend it for a very nice evening out. 
Our bill came to about $145 for two with wine, appetizers, mains and dessert.  In line with fine dining in Calgary."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and atmosphere of this little gem. Service was excellent and pricing was comparable for the food served. A great place to enjoy a quiet intimate lunch."}
{"text":"After a morning of shopping we decided to try Ratatouille Bistro for the first time as my daughter and I love GOOD French food.  Upon entering the atmosphere seemed pleasant enough and we chose a table by the window.  We ordered the bowl of beet soup,marinated olives and sparkling water.  When our waitress came I had to send my water glass and wine glass back as they were dirty.  The soup came and was extremely disappointing.  A huge bowl with about a quarter inch of soup over the bottom of the bowl and then overdrizzled with balsamic vinegar.  It tasted simply boring and vinegary.  The beet soup simply tasted of ground up processed beets with no flavour.  The olives came in a small bowl and were hot.  That was a surprise, they had obviously been over heated and withered, not what we were expecting.  The thing that was the most unacceptable was the huge quantity of dead bugs on the window sill.  It was decided right there that we would not go back.  I mentioned to the waitress that she may want to clean off the bugs and her answer was that she just did not get to it that morning.  In my opinion there was more than one days worth of bugs on that sill."}
{"text":"The prices were very high for the quality of the dishes. $15 for a beet salad that had 4-5 small beet slices over top small pile of chopped romaine (of note some lettuce was brown) . $30 Steak was grissly/low quality."}
{"text":"Fresh bread, beef bourginon (sp?) and a sunny window for lunch wow

Beef was a little salty but if eaten with the veg and or bread very tasty

Bread excellent, service prompt and professional

Must come by at night for the Cassoulet"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! I live close and had never been before. We met some friends here one night and it was great. Small place, not super busy but great food and really good wine! Service was excellent. I'd definitely go back...the steak was excellent."}
{"text":"A decent little neighborhood bistro, with good service and nice atmosphere. 

Tried the traditional french fare - escargot and bouillabaisse. Both good, not great. The escargot were a bit chewy, though well seasoned (nicely garlic-y) - but I had to request bread to mop up the juices. The bouillabaisse was just a touch overcooked, and the broth was a bit salty, though very flavorful.

I'm being a bit picky, but their prices justify holding them to a high standard."}
