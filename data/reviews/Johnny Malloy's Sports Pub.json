{"text":"I'll be back. I have heard a lot of complaints about this place. In fact we visited with a $20 gift card given to us by family member who won't even return for a free meal so what the heck - dinner for $10 out of pocket included the cash tip.

Wife had a steak which was done perfectly and a very generous salad. I had a very good-sized burger with, honestly, the best fries I've ever had. Yes, we will return. I don't think the prices were unreasonable. The service was speedy and professional. However, one of the employees (not the waitress) asked if everything was okay and seemed stunned that we said it was great. I guess they don't get a lot of compliments. 

There was a couple complaining at the table next to us but we could not hear what the complaint was but they had three people talking with them. I would imagine it is like anywhere that you have good and bad experiences and I may followup in the future with a negative story but this time... no complaints."}
{"text":"This is seriously the worst food I've ever tasted and I am so sorry that I didn't complain to the manager about this meal. We were a large group and maybe 2 of the 8 people actually liked their dinner. I had a chicken Caesar wrap and think the chicken must have been microwaved 300 times before it was stuffed inside the wrap. The fries were cold and soggy, which is sad that a bar can't even make fries right. Someone else at my table had stew, which was so mushy and disgusting looking. It seemed like they had heated and reheated it a million times before slapping it in the bowl. A few others in the party had chicken quesadillas, which was a complete illusion. They weren't really chicken, but 600 lbs of cheese and 2 small pieces of chicken. I think the only person who actually liked their meal was the person who ordered bread sticks, which we think came from the pizza place next door. YUCK!!!!"}

{"text":"We are regulars at this location as we only live five minutes away.  We usually sit at the bar and have had wings, pizza and appetizers with no complaints.  However, last night we stopped by for a dinner before heading home and were totally disappointed in my meal.  My husband ordered a half slab rib dinner and his food arrived hot and tasty.  I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken with penne. It arrived barely warm to the touch. I asked the waitress to have it reheated. She was more than willing to do so, but apparently the kitchen felt it was not necessary to heat the whole platter, because only the chicken came back hot. I again asked the waitress to reheat. She had the kitchen just make me a plate of the pasta...which came back hot..finally. But by then my husband had finished his meal and I had lost my appetite...Ended up asking for a box to take home....from now on, will eat at the bar and only eat the \"bar\" food!"}
{"text":"If I could put just a half of a star, I would. the iced tea was ok...and the water. even the ribs were good. but when you are told that you are getting cream of potato soup, then you should GET cream of potato soup. NOT CLAM CHOWDER..... I do NOT eat seafood, nor does the person i was dining with. havent even been able to find anywhere to contact people about this. rawr....."}
{"text":"Bad service all the way around.
We went to Johnny Malloys after Christmas shopping at Parmatown Mall.  It was a Saturday night and it was packed.  We got seated right away by the man who turned out to be our waiter.  (kinda weird how he came back to the table 30 seconds after seating us and acted like he had never seen us before but whatever)  My husband had a question about the beers they had on tap and the waiter seemed very frustrated and didn't know how to answer his question.  (I don't remember the question but it wasn't anything that hard to answer)  It took about 10 minutes to go get my husbands beer and my iced tea.  Then he was going to leave without taking our food order.  We asked nicely for him to take our order which he did. The whole night the waiter seemed to be in such a hurry and running around like a chicken with his head cut off.  Our food orders came out and my wrap sandwich was wrong.  The waiter was no where to be found so I called over the man who I assume was the manager on duty.  I told him the problem (left off two ingredients on the sandwich) and asked for the silverware that had never been brought to the table and some extra napkins.  The manager said he'd fix the sandwich but the napkins would come with the silverware.  I told him my sandwich was very sloppy and needed extra napkins, PLEASE!  I should not have had to argue with the manager to get extra napkins, especially after having my meal brought out wrong.  Never once did the manager apologize for the craziness of the night or my wrong food.  The waiter finally came back and would not directly address the problems but said he was sorry it was so crazy there that night.  (Didn't really cut it in my book)  All in all, the food wasn't terrible but the service was.  I won't be back again."}
