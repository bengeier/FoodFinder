{"text":"Love the selection to choose from. Prices are great. Food is hot and very good. The only thing I don't like is the \"fried\" rice. To me, it seems like it's just white rice covered in soy sauce. It's not fried and there are no eggs or veggies in it. They are very quick whether you eat in or carry out. All in all very good and affordable."}
{"text":"Egg roll-not very good. No brown rice and the sesame chicken was too sweet with one broccoli stalk!!  So go down the street to one of the other places. It was cheap so I did get what I paid for!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to lazy Chinese place and is great for what it is; filling, sweet, and salty delivery.  Their prices are very low, the service is friendly, and the delivery is always fast.    The lunch combo is a giant portion for $5, but I'm not a fan of their fried rice; it's really salty and greasy, but a lot of my friends like it."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and experienced a negative experience. The delivery was great, fast and friendly. I ordered Cashew Chicken and it was the most tasteless chinese dish I have ever eaten. Ever. Not a bit of taste, really. Plenty of meat and veggies. The egg roll was terrible. The wrapper was like hard flour and more carboard like than fried eggrolls are known for. And the filling was so basic, seemed to be just cabbage and it was tasteless as well, didn't even take another bite after first.    However, the sweet and sour soup was good and did have some heat, which I appreciated since some Chinese restaurants err on the side of no heat. Had less veggies and content than most H & S soup I've had though.    Stir fry sauces are the main reason a dish can be great or so-so. The brown sauce was the worst I've ever had as far \"no taste\". I really couldn't believe that would happen.  The restaurnat probably needs some kind of quality control in the kitchen. A dish should not be served like the one I got, and it's not a complicated recipe.  I've read some other negative reviews and wonder if the restaurant even cares.  I truly only posted this negative because I'd like others to beware, AND the restaurant needs to pay attention to the reviews and do some taste testing and watch the kitchen to improve. I have always given positives where due and have no other agenda for dissing this restaurant. It was one meal I received and maybe it's a fluke.  I do hope they improve if there is a persistant issue, because they are in a great locale. Never did find the menu they said they had online. A tiny square came up on FB, but too small and wouldn't open.  Seems like this restaurant needs some attention to detail. Thanks for listening."}
{"text":"I tried this place when I was working over in the Highland Creek area of Charlotte NC and it was great. I give this place five stars because it would be the Chinese restaurant I would order from if I lived in this part of Charlotte. I will definitely be back next time I am working in the area."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I've ever been to... I asked about items on the menu and what I ordered was completely different than what I received. The chicken was white as a sheet of paper and soggy and disgusting tasting. I brought it back right away and they completely disrespected me and tried to get me to pay for something I refused to eat. The rice didn't have any vegetables in it or eggs like fried rice should have. It was a shit show. I even looked at my bank account and they didn't void it like I thought they did. They fucked me over, don't let it happen to you."}
{"text":"I always judge a Chinese restaurant by the cashew chicken. This one was spot-on. Good flavor, no celery (which can dominate the dish), plenty of chicken. The fried rice is more like white rice in soy sauce, but I liked the flavor of it - no veggies mixed in.  Plenty of food for a combo-dish. I\"ll be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Our go to place for take out! We recently move to Highland Creek and stumbled upon Chia Bistro in an effort to fill our bellies with Sesame Chicken and haven't bothered to check out anywhere else. Their portions are easily large enough for two meals and their egg drop soup is great. Food is always hot, even after the ten minute ride home. Must try!"}
{"text":"For a budget Chinese restaurant, this is lot better compared anything I have seen in Charlotte. Clean, not expensive and importantly quality food."}
{"text":"Husband and I stopped in Chia Bistro during the lunch special hours. The food was less than delicious. We sampled the hot and sour soup, Hunan beef and sa cha chicken. All the dishes lacked flavor. The egg roll and fried rice that accompanied the meal was clearly prepared days ago and reheated."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese takeout restaurant.  Delivery is fast and the food is always hot.  Portions are huge.  Carryout is also quick and it's reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We order shrimp and broccoli in garlic sauce from this restaurant often. This wasn't on the menu when I tried it but maybe it is now. Everything tastes good and the people are friendly. We've become regulars. I didn't expect it to be hard to find good Chinese when we relocated to Charlotte from Philly, but it was. This is our go-to and it's in the neighborhood. And they deliver!"}
{"text":"Having recently moved to Highland Creek, my fianc√© and I started exploring the area for good food. We saw this place while we were driving by so decided to give it a try.  We went in on a Wednesday night. The place wasn't too full, just about 3 other tables were occupied. We were told to pick any table. The server took our beverage order and got us our menus. For a restaurant with about 10-12 tables they only had one server and she wasn't super knowledgable. Maybe she was new. She seemed nice, even though we had to remind her twice to bring us the chilli oil (again, one server for too many tables).  We ordered the hot and sour soup and Triple Star for our entree. The hot and sour soup was pretty bland. It lacked flavor, salt and spice. Even some salt, pepper and soy sauce didn't fix it. The Triple Star (a combination of chicken, shrimp and beef in a brown sauce) was decent enough. I would definitely order that again, although it's nothing super awesome to write about.  At one point the owner came out to survey the place. By then there was just one other table still occupied. He asked them how the food was etc etc. He did look over at us twice and made eye contact but didn't think it was important enough to ask us how our food was. Oh well, I go to a restaurant for not just food but service as well. I didn't feel welcome here. I'm not sure I would consider going here, especially when there's another decent Chinese restaurant just 5 minutes away. Oh and by the way, no fortune cookies with the check :("}
{"text":"They delivered fast food was fresh hot delicious we had house fried rice and sesame seed chicken egg drop wonton soup it was totally awesome..The best in town"}
{"text":"this is my go-to chinese place. i love them! the owners are really nice but their other staff seems to have high turnover. i am always talking to a new person every few days but most are pretty nice. only one person really messed up my order. in any case, the food is consistently yummy."}
{"text":"Great place to get quick and great food. The food is cheap and always taste great. One of my favorite Chinese restaurants around. Definitely give it a shot and it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is joke. So my wife and I went to Chia Bistro based on the reviews.  Boy was that a mistake. I asked about items on the menu they don't have any knowledge about food and customer service. I have had Thai from several different restaurants in different cities, and this place is by far the worst! We walked in on a Saturday night. Restaurant was empty. The food is way under salted and under cooked. The quality isn't there.  I would recommend people to skip over this place"}
{"text":"I don't see why there are negative reviews of this place.  I am authentically chinese and love chinese food.  This place is a gem in Huntersville, NC of all places!  Having lived in New York City, San Francisco, London, Taipei, and Los Angeles, this place is pretty good for food on the go. Perhaps the previous reviewers didn't know what to order.   I would recommend the General's chicken, fried dumplings, and singapore rice noodle.  Super delicious! Their beef with broccoli is superb as well.  I also LOVE that their portions are HUGE and enough for 2 meals.  Economical.  :)   They never claim that the brown rice is \"fried\" rice.  It's a healthier, well-seasoned alternative.  Don't hate. I love the concept and it's delicious!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Crab Rangoons as an appetizer and the Sesame trio as an entree. The service was quick and the staff was friendly. The Rangoons had the perfect shell to cheese ratio and the sweet and sour sauce was nice.  The sesame trio was phenomenal. It was sweet and savory. My only issue was the ratio of the beef, chicken, and shrimp (Chicken a plenty and almost no beef). Very good and I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I just finished my dinner that I picked up tonight from Chia Bistro. This restaurant happens to be in my neighborhood, so I thought I would give it a try. I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but I really felt like giving credit where credit is due.   I ordered scallops and mixed vegetables. There was a generous helping of large scallops that were cooked to perfection and delicious. Also, there was quite a variety of vegetables that were carefully cooked, so that they were not too crunchy or too limp and bursting with flavor. The meal was served in a delicate brown sauce, which was carefully seasoned and absolutely delicious!  Wow! I was so happy to find this treasure right in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Pretty good and super cheap (not in quality but in price).  Lunch specials are varied and plentiful.  I like that they allow you to chose between fried rice and steamed rice as I do not like fried rice with my saucy chicken dishes and most other Chinese restaurants have it fixed on their daily or lunch specials.They serve good portions for a fraction of the price of competitors.     This is my new place for those weekdays when I do not want to cook, want good food but have little money to spend.  :)"}
{"text":"So a few days ago noon rolled around and I found myself getting hungry.  But I wanted something quick, cheap, and from someplace new.  Chia Bistro came to mind so I tried to find their menu online to see if it was worth the drive there (not exactly around the corner from me), and of course for reviews!  They have no info online, but I was able to find a small selection of positive reviews @ various sites.  Needed gas anyway, so gathered up the children (dogs!) and headed out.    Walked in around 12:30 & the place was empty, save one lone construction guy having lunch.  That kinda thing usually raises an eyebrow, especially at the height of 'lunch hour,\" and even more so on a Friday.  Browsed the menu & decided on the Hunan Chicken lunch combo ($6.01 w/tax).  While the lady that took my order wasn't exactly what I would deem \"friendly\" by any stretch, I did like that she didn't give me any lip when I asked for double rice instead of the obligatory egg roll, and to only have broccoli, carrots & water chestnuts, so that earned a star.  There is a rather large waiting area at the entrance, with plenty of seating available.  More restaurants should follow suit.  The dining area was on the smallish side, with maybe 10 or 12 tables, so that keeps things a smidge intimate.  D√©cor was pretty inviting, without  the expected explosion of kitsch.    One review I read online said that portion sizes were humongous.  Maybe this was an off day, but my portion was far from humongous.  I was surprised at how LITTLE they gave me.  VERY small amount of chicken & veggies, and two miniscule scoops of rice (more like glorified tablespoons).  Lotus Express just down the way from my house gives twice that easily, if not more!  But I wasn't starving, so I thought if was that yummy I would get over the portion size.    I probably won't be back unless someone else is treating.  As we all know you can order the same dish at five different Chinese restaurants and it will completely different at each one.  That's what sets them apart from their neighbors.  But this had the strangest flavor to it.  The chicken itself was cooked well, but the Hunan sauce had THE STRANGEST flavor.  I'm not sure how to describe it really.  Kind of a \"cooking-class-gone-wrong\" flavor.  **insert inside-out face here**     And that rice.  They call it fried rice.  Not exactly.  I've never seen rice such a dubious shade of brown or  unusual texture.  And that oily taste.  Ick.    Been there, tried that.  I can cross Chia Bistro off my bucket list....and my list in general .  :)"}
{"text":"This is our go to delivery for Chinese! It's quick and easy, food is good and so far no complaints from anyone in the family.  My only complaint is that we don't get as much food as we do at other Chinese restaurants... but really other than that nothing bad at all to say. My family loves Chinese food and this place is a great go to!"}
{"text":"Beef and broccoli was good. Sesame chicken wasn't bad. The brown rice was bland. No taste what so ever. The egg roll was bland as well. Not even sure what was inside when all you see is white. The prices are more then Red Dragon on Poplar Tent. We probably won't be coming back to Chia Bistro as we'd rather go somewhere that costs less and tastes a whole lot better."}
