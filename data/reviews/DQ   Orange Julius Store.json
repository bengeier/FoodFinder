{"text":"Dairy Queen is the perfect treat for a warm summer evening!  This location is tiny, but conveniently located near the Rogers Centre.  It's always very, very clean and the staff is friendly.  

I most recently had the Berry Blast smoothie from the \"Orange Julius\" side of the menu and it was delicious, as per usual!  I've had a Blizzard there before, too, and I found them to be a little skimpy on the \"mixins\", although that could be because I'm a quasi-candy freak!  They have a freezer full of ready-made cakes, treats and ice cream bars if you need something to go, and I noticed that they sell gift cards at this location, as well.

They have a small counter area with stools if you want to dine-in, as well as a flat plasma TV if you want to catch up on the news while you eat your treat."}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot for several years, but sometime in March/April 2015 they fired some of the old staff and brought on new staffers who put NOTHING in the blizzards.

I mean, literally NOTHING.

The first time, I assumed it was a mistake. The second time, I took my blizzard back to the store and showed the employee that there was literally no topping in the blizzard, she mumbled an excuse about it probably being crushed too finely and re-made it for me.

This location has become a rip-off."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with this location. They don't do justice to Dairy Queen standards. They let me down all the time - be it shakes, blizzard...it tastes just about average."}
{"text":"Picked up a Ice Cream cake here and was what you would expect from DQ. Prices are fine (around $25-30 for an ice cream cake) and they also sell candles. Very small location, and pretty much only room to sit alone the ledge (along the window) while you wait for them to prepare your order."}
{"text":"Just drove by and decided turn into Golden Gate Plaza  since its a beautiful day to have ice cream. This is located in a residential area which makes it convenient for families to walk over and grab a treat. The service is fast and friendly and they have an outside seating area too! It seemed busy so I will assume that it is quite popular with the locals. I will be coming here more often for either ice cream or fruit smoothie with ma homies."}
{"text":"I ordered a cake for my best friend's 25th birthday. It was last minute and I wanted a Tupac themed cake. 

The staff was able to accommodate my request and did a spectacular job! Not only was it done on time but the cake turned out better than expected. The cake was a big hit at the party! 

If you're looking for a customized and an affordable cake at any occasion - this is the place to get them. I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times for ice cream but I have to say it's the dirtiest Dairy Queen location I've ever been to (and I promise I've been to loads of Dairy Queen locations in Ontario). The staff was either not trained properly or just choose to be lazy and unfriendly to the customers. It's also the only location where you can't really see the food when they're making it for you. The best Dairy Queen location in Brampton is definitely the Centre St location, great patio and great service there."}
{"text":"Noob workers makes for an awful experience! 23 minutes waiting for a blizzard. Three workers one experienced two prob their first day! So busy! No one knew how to make anything and I felt bad. The manager sure knows how to schedule!! After waiting forever we got our blizzards! Totally #firstworldproblems lol"}
{"text":"Walked 30 mins in the cold earlier this week to this Dairy Queen to try to get the BOGO blizzard deal. I had checked the hours online. It said they closed at 10pm. I got there around 9pm and found a poorly hand written sign with different hours saying they closed at 8pm. This was reflected no where online. It was such a frustrating and disappointing experience. I just wanted some ice cream :( so sad. Had to walk even further to McDonald's to satisfy my soft serve craving! Please update your hours online if you change them in the future"}
{"text":"I do love me some Dairy Queen but this particular location always seems to be jam packed with not enough staff to accommodate demand.

There is a nice patio to sit on outside which is cool, I just wish they stocked the napkin dispenser consistently....

With that said, try the dipped cone or Skor blizzard - yummy!!

Yay!! Dairy Queen!!"}
{"text":"Inexperienced staff, locks doors earlier than advertised. Inconsistent product and no sense of management. Not very clean.

This review is based on a couple occasions at different hours with different staff! I sure hope something changes as Dairy Queen is always a fun place to grab a quick treat!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a dairy queen fan and this location lives up to my expectations. Living in cityplace there are limited snack food choices but I couldnt be happier with this store as my go to. 
Every time I go the ladies are very friendly and in good spirits. They accommodate all my request for the blizzards I order. Sometimes even changing toppings or adding without additional charges.
The reason I am most recently pleased is on a Friday night we wanted a late dessert (around 11:45pm). Thinking it closes at 10 we decide to call anyways. They were open but closing everything up. We said we would be there in 5 minutes and she said she would wait for us. We arrived and she was happy to make our blizzards. Most other places if you show up right before closing will give you attitude or bad service. This lady was nice, quantity of topping to ice cream ratio was perfect and it was definitely enjoyable.
They also have a buy one get one for $0.99 special now for any blizzard, any topping.
I highly recommend this Dairy Queen location for your ice cream fix."}
{"text":"Terrible location.  Staff at this location never put anything in their blizzards but normally when I ask for it to be fixed they do so no problem.  Today however, the moron working the counter automatically refused my service as soon as I requested that it be fixed.  He also claimed he was the owner and refused to give his name. NEVER give this location your money, they're a joke."}
{"text":"I love this DQ. It's close to my house which is a bonus,  so whenever I'm wanting Ice-cream I always make my way there. 

The staff are nice, friendly and paitent when I'm making my orders (because sometimes it takes some time to decide) and they offer great suggestions when I'm undecided. 

Also,  they made me an ice cream cake for my birthday and it was Awesome. It was the same girl who did my cake last year and she remembered me. She was extremely helpful and great when I was loading suggestions and ideas to her. She made my cake Exactly how I wanted it,  and I couldn't have been happier. 

I am a regular here and will continue to be. This place is great and I love it!"}
{"text":"A small location perfectly situated for denizens of the Concord CityPlace complex, this Dairy Queen is NOT the kind with hamburgers and chicken and what not. Hot dogs are available, but I encourage you to seek street meat from elsewhere - tastier and cheaper that way.

In terms of frozen or otherwise cold confections, a decent spot. There always seems to be a decent array of frozen cakes and what not ready to go in the freezer, and staff is usually quick about getting your blizzard or what not prepared quickly. I have had some issues communicating orders some times, but it's usually OK. Price and quality is common for DQ outfits - a bit pricey especially on smaller sizes, and not the greatest quality. It sure beats NOT having ice cream or other frozen treats, though.

Seating area is rather cramped as you're sharing it with the checkout area. There is a flat-panel TV, always tuned to CP24 stretched out of aspect ratio."}
