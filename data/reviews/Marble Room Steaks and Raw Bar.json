{"text":"This place was phenomenal, the wait staff was awesome steve took great care of us.  The oysters were the BEST in Cleveland.  Drinks are on point, great choice of wine and whiskey."}
{"text":"I attempted to call for a reservation any Friday or Saturday for the next two months and they claim they are full unless you want to eat at 10 PM. I've lived in Cleveland all my life and I've never waited that long for a reservation. My guess is that they hold reservations for \"VIPs\" because no restaurant has a two month wait list in Cleveland Ohio. No restaurant is worth that! We will not be going. Cleveland has many more restaurants in town that can accommodate a party of two for a special occasion. They can't fool all the people of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Nice room, good service, but for the hefty price, the food was mediocre at best. Capital Grille, Red, XO (Pepper Pike) are a better choice."}
{"text":"Came in at night with some of my girlfriends. Amazing building. Great location. Sat in the lounge area. Everything had the potential to be amazing, but it wasn't. My drinks tasted great, so did my food. However, my drinks came way after my sushi arrived. I watched my server and the other cocktail server constantly begging bartenders for their drinks and being ignored. We waited 20 minutes for cocktails and were in an area where we could see the process. My sushi was almost gone by the time my drinks arrived. The music was obnoxiously loud and we asked several times for the music to be turned down and it was clear that management was unwilling to oblige. The Belly dancer was a strange add on and I don't understand why she was there. I noticed both the cocktail lounge girls were borderline being harassed by managers for things that were out of their control. I worked as a server for years and there's no way to greet, serve, establish a relationship, clear plates, run drinks, and remain sane with someone constantly stepping on your toes and no one there to help out. Service is about team work and it seemed like management had no interest in proper leadership. Kudos to anyone working under these weird conditions."}
{"text":"Only Day 2 for this new restaurant and it is already a must dine.  Sushi chef is world class and the atmosphere is second to none.  The Land gets blessed with another top shelf dining experience.  Bravo."}
{"text":"By far, the beat dining experience ever.  Went there with four friends and had zero complaints.  Staff was great. The flank steak was absolutely amazing but my favorite thing was the corn side dish! The ambiance/architecture is stunning.  Definitely a must-try place and I guarantee you will go back.  I am going to make a reservation for early December.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Today was our 3rd visit to The Marble Room. The first two times were a bit shaky; especially with the service. But today was absolutely exceptional. Our waiter, Jeffrey could not have been better. He has the style and charisma of a waiter from the 1930s. Very polished. Extremely professional and just an absolute pleasure to converse with. We talked about everything from the ambiance in the restaurant, to how poorly the Cleveland browns have been playing as of late. You truly made this an exceptional experience Jeffrey. Thank you. For all of those who may have had a \"so so\" experience when this place first opened, go back and request Jeffrey. He is by faaaaaaaaaar the best one. What an amazing experience!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Having read many reviews highlighting less than satisfactory service, I was hesitant to spend this much money (definitely not a bargain-hunter's dream establishment) and risk having our own disappointing experience.  Fortunately, our evening spent at Marble Room lived up to the food-hype, and dispelled any reservations regarding service.  Our server was Jacquise, who took very good care of us (attentive without being invasive) and guided us through the menu.  Mixed drinks were strong and priced on par with other high-end restaurants.  The miso salmon appetizer was delicious but the standout was the butternut squash soup.  $11 for a bowl of soup?  Yes - when it is this silky, creamy, tasty, and well presented.

Two of us ordered the filets, the other two ordered the ribeye.  Steaks were prepared as ordered, with the ribeye, of course, being the more flavorful.  Sides are separate; the table shared the roasted Brussel sprouts, a gigantic loaded baked potato, and a \"potato cake\" that was the standout.  For dessert each couple shared the Flambé Alaska for two.  Prepared with gelato rather than ice cream, the presentation was fun but I didn't care for the tartness of the gelato against the sweetness of the meringue.  But that was just me as the rest of the table loved it. 

For us, this will be a special occasion destination."}
{"text":"Beautiful place! Stopped in around dinner to get a quick drink at the bar. Service was prompt and the bartenders were very pleasant and attentive. We did not eat but the food being served looked and smelled excellent. 
The smell of the sushi bar does hit you a little when you first walk in, but goes away unless you are sitting next to it. Really pretty, elegant restaurant...looks like a good place for a group to get dinner to celebrate an occasion."}
{"text":"Spectacular ambiance! The restaurant is located in a former bank building that has been updated/converted to accommodate dining. The steaks and salmon were fantastic. Very attentive wait staff. Cool environment and clientele. Great place for a date. Pretty pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"This was suppose to be special dinner for four of us but between the service and the quality of food it one that we want to forget. The room is impressive. The raw bar had some of the best raw oysters we have had this year. But when they came to the table there was no horseradish or cocktail sauce. Instead there was other concoctions that we would not use. So we ask for sauce and horseradish and 15 minutes later it arrived. An Italian pasta dish was ordered with seafood but was not eaten because of the flavor. It just did not taste good. An order of scallops (three for $30) came out cold. The manager took the charges of for the pasta and scallop dish. But I would never go back."}
{"text":"Food was tremendous and the space was absolutely stunning.  I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"For vegetarians there are plenty of side dishes to try that are really good. I tried the drink with Absinthe which was very good, I would go back just to have that drink again!

The problem is their service staff. 2 servers had an argument on how one wasn't authorized to give people table's and it was ugly. 2 other staff members had discussions but I couldn't understand what they were arguing about. Very little hospitality, in fact really bad actitude from one of the staff girls telling me that she wasn't a server \"Hi, I know your kitchen closes soon, could you please take my friend's order?\",  \"I am not sure server, go back to your table and wait for hee\" \"I know but if she doesn't show up the kitchen will close\" \"I cannot help you I don't know when the kitchen closes either\"........ I forgot to add they all seemed like loss chickens in a farm too.

They need to elevate the quality of their staff to meet the quality of their food and venue... hopefully they get there soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for a charming lunch. 
To begin with, the ambiance is absolutely incredible. Beautiful job restoring and decorating. 
The food and wine was also great. We had the house Chardonnay (shhh, I know it's lunch time), I the crab cake and sushi. All fresh and tasty. 
Definitely is a spot for special occasions, but I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great service, amazing place and incredible food! Can't wait to go back when I visit Cleveland again."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal and experience at the Marble Room. The restaurant itself is probably one of the most impressive I've ever seen, easily in my top 5 of all time. There is so much architectural beauty and attention to detail, it's almost difficult to take it all in without just wandering/snooping around (which we discussed), but you're there to eat dinner and don't want to disturb the other guests! It honestly feels like a museum or other national landmark. 

All of the dishes we ordered were excellent. Everyone had a little something different and we tried each other's meals. I was very impressed with my pork chop, and the hamachi appetizer was out of this world. I only wish there was more of it!  As for the sides, the two standouts were the Mac and cheese and the creamed spinach. 

Scott, our server, was very good and did an excellent job of answering any questions we had. He also made sure our meal stayed on schedule without being rushed; as we had a show to catch at Playhouse Square. Everything was timed perfectly and we had a wonderful time.

Despite only being open for a few months, I believe the Marble Room has worked out any kinks they may have previously had. Our experience was flawless, and what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber and price point. We will absolutely be back! Hopefully next time, we will be able to do a bit more snooping around."}
{"text":"Nice place in Downtown CLE. Good steaks snd fresh seafood.  Amazing setting and decor in old NCB building.  Quite busy on a Wed night.  Pricey - Bring your corporate card. 

Note: Policy is NOT to allow guests to bring their own wine. No corkage policy. Just NO.  Most of the wine on the list consisted of off years..."}
{"text":"Fantastic steakhouse! Food was amazing and the atmosphere was unbelievable! They have private vault rooms that you can reserve for big parties! The staff, the food... awesome! 5 Stars for sure!!! I will definitely be back! On another note, great history on this place especially being an old bank!"}
{"text":"I know it's a raw bar, but this first thing my group of 5 commented on is that it's smells like farts in the lobby; not a great first impression. The decor is amazing and it feels like a grand dining experience. As others have said, it's like stepping back in time to the '20s.

The service was pretty terrible. The wait staff was inaudible across the table and they had to check on the daily specials for the soup and bento box of the day.  They struggled to keep glasses full and were overall slow.

The food was acceptable but unremarkable. The portions were generally small. Cleveland is a food town and at this price point you can go to any one of a number of the city's dining destinations and be more satisfied.

Go here for happy hour or a drink before an event, but eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Fantastic downtown eatery. Beautiful decor and architecture. Service is top notch. I dined at the bar and was taken care of by the stellar trio of Lou, Colleen and Melanie. The ribeye is off the charts good... Cooked to perfection.

{"text":"Had reservations for Valentine's Day around 9:30pm, we did arrive early around 30 mins but the hostess got our table ready quickly, they had a porter house steak and lobster tail for two special for Valentines so we tried that, the whole meal was great! The steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned wonderfully. Also ordered the oysters and a beautiful dessert with the most delicious little macaroons on the side. Service was great waitress was fast and attentive even though it was busy for the holiday. There were two musicians a violinist and saxophonist playing table side and around the restaurant very nice touch. Food was great service was great and atmosphere was A+ definitely a new Cleveland favorite spot of mine."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience!  The sushi (salmon mango roll, shrimp curry roll, hamachi crudo, fish and chips roll) and iceberg salad were delicious.  I took my wife here for a date on Saturday and the experience exceeded our expectations.  After last night we have a new restaurant to throw into our dinning rotation.  We are looking forward to working our way through the menu, while taking in an old world environment.  For added fun and entertainment we walked down east 4th and grabbed a drink at \"society\" a cool speak easy.  Very impressed!!"}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous. We ordered the surf and turf sushi... awesome. My filet was AMAZING. Had it topped with truffle butter and a side of bernaise. I wanted to go back the next night and get it again. Boy friend had the Wagyu skirt steak... ordered it medium and was a little undercooked but still good. He said he'd rather have the filet next time after trying mine. Will def go back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! The interior, ambiance, food, service and overall vibe is A+."}
{"text":"Great place to go on a Friday night if you don't want to speak with the people you're dining with. I've been twice (both on Friday nights) and both times, they have this guy playing a saxophone and a woman playing a violin over the loud speaker while music blares. I'm not kidding when I say you cannot hear the people you're with. We went first for a work party in private dining & everything was amazing-- the violin and sax people were in the main restaurant so we could see them but it wasn't too loud but the second time we took my mom for her birthday and sat in the dining room near the bar and it was impossible to hear anything over the music. We couldn't even hear our server. The room is beautiful, the food is delicious and the service was pretty good but we just sat in this amazing space in silence enjoying our food. For a $450 check for 3 people, you should be able to talk with the people at your table. Maybe they only have this sax and violin music thing on Fridays and I just went the wrong day, but I won't be back to try to find out."}
{"text":"My usual reviews are almost entirely focused on the food and drinks but for Marble Room I was most struck by the ambiance and the service.

We had reservations last Saturday and were looking forward to it after seeing what Crop Bistro did with a similar setting and we weren't disappointed in the renovations that restored an old bank building to a truly stunning dining room. The opulence and the size was built to impress bank visitors more than 50 years ago and it does the same for diners now.

And the staff is trained to match that initial impression. The servers worked as a team and always showed utmost professionalism while still having the friendliness to give us a relaxed dining experience. It reminded me of some of the restaurants with Michelin stars we've eaten at.

The trained staff extended to the bartenders as our drinks (especially my old-fashioned) were perfectly mixed with each ingredient complementing the others. They have a very extensive wine list but we stuck with cocktails after seeing how good the first round was.

One of the appetizers we had was a crab cake that seemed to have almost no filler and which came with a perfectly tart sauce that cut through the heaviness of the cake. The second appetizer was a foie gras that ended up being the only misstep of the night. The meat was perfectly cooked and the seasonal jam that came with it is exactly what is required when eating foie but it also came on a funnel cake -- powder sugar and all! The light batter just did not pair well with the heavy liver. An \"A\" for imagination and creativity but I'm afraid a much lower grade for concept.

But that was soon forgotten with the main courses as my wagyu skirt steak with truffled fries was perfectly cooked and seasoned while Jeannene's 6-ounce filet was seasoned even better --the salt and pepper just singing on the tongue. We also had a side of creamed spinach which was also quite decent. We were with two other people who had the chicken breast Tuscan style and the Berkshire pork chop and they both had high praise.

We didn't want our visit to end so we tried a couple of desserts, neither of which sounded like the lightest of desserts but the pastry chef knows they will be following main courses full of some massive hunks of meats. One dessert was a strawberry shortcake that looked elegant but still tasted like a grandmother whipped it up while the second sweet treat was the madarin orange cheesecake which was soft and creamy and which we smeared through dots of very tart yuzu and orange sauces on the plate -- very tropical.

So, yeah -- 5 stars"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh seafood and fantastic service!  Manager provided private tour of vault dining room and bar.  Definitely venue of choice for next group event."}
{"text":"I left an online submission and called twice early last week to inquire about a private dining room.  Nobody wrote back or called.  A little annoyed and trying one last time through yelp to see if I can get. A response. Thank you."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! At first we were hesitant after reading prior reviews that said the lobby smelled like farts. However, that was far from the case! My fiancé and I were celebrating our engagement and the staff was very accommodating. Not only did they take us on a private tour of the restaurant but surprised us with a cake congratulating us on our special evening. The food and service were both outstanding, try the gratin potato's-5 stars!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you go to say you've been, but not a place you keep coming back to. 

The four stars are for the absolutely stunning  ambience and decor. They did a phenomenal job picking every last detail from the glassware, to the linens, to the seating. You truly feel like royalty when sitting in this restaurant. We had the pleasure of listening to an incredibly dynamic live violinist and sax player - all of this combined would have made for an awesome night even without any libations. 


The food was good, but way over seasoned. My diver sea scallops were not the freshest, so perhaps why they went a little overboard on the salt. The side of potato gratin was so hot and over cooked, that even by the end of the meal, we were still burning our tongues and could barely taste anything other than the burnt breadcrumbs. My fiancé's pokè bowl was much better, with the tuna being prepared and seasoned perfectly.  

Our cocktails were delicious, so while I don't know if we will be able to justify eating here again, we will be back for a cocktail or two. 


The service was excellent but the waiter really continuously pressured us to get the most expensive things on the menu, that plus the fact that someone called me four times in a row in the middle of my workday to confirm my reservation left a poor taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"My husband had been here for a business event, and wanted to take me for our 26th anniversary.  The venue is spectacular - I felt like a gawky tourist looking at the architecture.  Unfortunately, we were disappointed by the service.  My husband's lamb arrived nearly raw (he had asked for it to be prepared medium rare), and it took us awhile to get the attention of our waiter.  When it was re-cooked it was delivered by who I think was the manager without a word of apology, or any remark for that matter.  The food was delicious.  My pork chop was perhaps the best I've had.  Our waiter was just very inattentive, and when he was helping us was very aloof.  He practically threw the bag with our leftovers on the booth while saying \"here's your stuff.\"  When the food is that pricey (and we ordered a very nice bottle of wine to boot) we expect better service than what we received.  Not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Overall, the ambiance here was so unique, it felt like a dining room straight out of a time machine from 1920. I came here for a group gathering and the service was impeccable. The waitress was very nice and helpful. She went above and beyond for our large party. The food was incredible, the service overall was excellent and the price (while expensive, was worth every cent). 

Food 5/5 
We started with complimentary freshly toasted bread. For appetizers, we had the oysters and a platter of raw seafood (from the awesome raw bar) and sushi. Trying not to fill myself at the first course, the steak (a 48oz tomahawk cooked perfectly) sure did the job. Desert for the final course was incredible and highly recommended. The chocolate cake was on par! 

Service 5/5 
We had multiple servers and they were very attentive, filling our waters constantly, switching out our plates and silverware between courses and checking up on us. They were very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list was incredible! It was also very nice that the restaurant had valet. 

Price 5/5 
The ambiance was the most worthwhile part of this dining experience and the food to compliment this experience was worth the price. 

I've had plenty of steaks in the Cleveland area and it is safe to say Marble Room blows the others out of the water. Highly recommended and I can't wait to come back. Planning on coming for a special occasion with my girlfriend for next time!"}
{"text":"The stars are for the oysters, the sauces served with them were delicious. 

My husband ordered the bone in ribeye ($64) Pittsburg style. Seared on the outside but still rare on the inside. It came out more burnt, which you could taste that burnt grill flavor. For that price I would expect to leave thinking the steak was so good. 

I ordered the scallops, which were really good but for $38 you would expect more than 3 for an entree. 

I made our reservation on Open Table. When I made it there was a checkbox are you celebrating a x,y,z. I selected birthday. Didn't think much of it. After our meal our server asked if we wanted to see a dessert menu. We both said no just the check. Well after a few minutes our server says you can't leave yet. And then comes out with a mini chocolate tart thing that says Happy Birthday. Ok cute. Well our bill comes and there is a $4 charge for it........ one I never requested it, we both asked for the check no dessert. I get it, it's $4 but that's ridiculous. I mean either bring a free dessert or don't do anything.

Overall experience was meh. The building, setting, etc. are gorgeous and I would go back to sit in the bar. But the food is definitely missing the level I would expect for that price. I think Red is a better option!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in Cleveland. Food was fantastic and the atmosphere is great.  By far the best steak I've had here.  The service however was poor, and that's being polite. For the 800 dollars we spent on the night I've gotten better service at an Irish pub. The place was not busy but yet we were constantly looking for our waiter to take our food order and then order more drinks. I'm honestly torn between the excellent meal and the poor service.


Elissa, thank you for reaching out.  I responded and provided you with a detailed account of the evening."}
{"text":"The Space - The restaurant is situated in the National City Bank Banking Room with Corinthian columns and gorgeous ceiling - the room and ambiance are nothing short of AMAZING - clearly a room that will impress.

The Food - The food was \"Above Average\" but not exceptional.  The caesar salad and oysters were wonderful.  The strip steak was cooked perfectly and the lamb came out to the table as medium rare but kept cooking to medium well.  Good flavors and the side of Kind Crab Wild Rice as very good.  They had trouble with the cappuccino machine so I took coffee - which unfortunately had been sitting awhile, so it tasted burnt.  I am sure the food will catch up to ambiance but the inconstant quality and delivery of the kitchen is characteristic of a start up restaurant.

The Service - The front desk/ Maitre D stand was serviced by two young ladies who were reserved and seem to be unsure of themselves.  They were not overly friendly or welcoming, but pleasant.   Our server Joey was genuine and willing and eager to please.  He checked in with us and was welcoming. In fairness to Joey, we did mention to him the issue with coffee as it was minor to the evening.

Conclusions - I have to believe with what has been invested in the space, there is a commitment to get the food to the exceptional rating.  I would go back and expect to see improvement as the kitchen and team find their rhythm."}
{"text":"This place is stunning! The most beautiful restaurant I've ever seen. You are greeted by live harp music which makes the journey to your table an other worldly experience. The staff is well trained and executed our experience beautifully. The food was awesome. We are spoiled in Cleveland to have one of the best steakhouses in the country (Red), and Marble Room is almost as good. One of our party ordered the raw bar poo-poo platter and we loved it. The Caprese salad was one of the best I've had and it was Fall in Cleveland.  Desserts were excellent and capped a perfect evening here for us."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Everything about it!   Food, service and ambiance!   You've outdone yourself, MR and certainly everyone else!!"}
{"text":"Five stars all the way. Can't go wrong here and the service is impeccable. Highly highly recommend and if six stars were an option that's what they'd have! Can't count the number of dinners I've had here but each one seems to be flawless and the location and decor is fantastic too! LOVE IT HERE!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Wow!  Just wow!  What a great experience!  From the decor to the service to the food, everything was simply wonderful!  We had wanted to visit this relatively new restaurant sooner but life got in the way.  I'm so glad we finally made it!  The decor is simply breathtaking!  What was an old bank had been transformed into one of the most beautiful restaurants in Cleveland.  You can still see a few touches of the bank in the lights and tables. We arrived a little before our reservation so we sat at the bar and enjoyed a drink.   I had a Marble Room Mojito and it was delicious. It was fun to watch the bartenders in action -- they obviously know what they are doing! After we were shown to our table, I ordered a shrimp cocktail to start and my husband had an order of six oysters.  While I enjoyed my shrimp, it couldn't compare to how much my husband LOVED his oysters!    He frequently orders oysters when we're out and he said these were the best he's ever had -- anywhere!  For my entree I had the 8 ounce filet and my husband ordered the New York Strip.  They were both fantastic!    We also split the creamed spinach and crispy potato cake and both the sides were very good.  We didn't have room for dessert but everything sounded wonderful.  The service -- from the hostess to the bartenders to the main server to the people who brought the food -- was top notch.  The prices are expensive and this will certainly be a special occasion spot for us but we both were happy with the total experience and we can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I'll set the scene, I wasn't expecting this atmosphere in Cleveland Ohio. You walk into this massive room with soaring ceilings and beautiful giant pillars with a wine room above the bar. The place is magnificent! I highly suggest reservations BUT you can get there early and snag a bar seat. We went before the game on Saturday for a few drinks/appetizers and will be back for dinner soon. We had the sushi tacos, shrimp cocktail and chilled king crab. The king crab was perfect, sweet and a very nice portion. I am looking forward to returning and trying the dinner menu. Fancy spot to sit and relax, enjoy the scenery and splurge a little."}
{"text":"Wow, being here makes you feel like you are in the Great Gatsby or traveled back to the 1930s! The decor of the restaurant is very opulent and elegant.

The food was great! My favorites were the oysters (which were large and not too expensive), the Surf-N-Turf roll, and the handmade spaghetti with lobster. The foie gras, curry coco shrimp roll, and herbed lamb chops were very good too. I didn't like the Yellowfin tuna taco trio as much; the flavors were not quite balanced enough. They have an extensive wine menu and I shared one of the less expensive Burgundy wines with my friends, which was an excellent wine.

The service seemed fine, though the meal took a while to come out. I think something must have been messed up in the kitchen. Also, my friend had ordered the duck but they accidentally brought lamb out instead. For these mistakes, they graciously gave us another bottle of wine on the house.

Overall, it was an excellent meal! Can't wait to go back! Important tip: make reservations as far ahead as you can in advance (like a week or two) because it is a very popular place."}
{"text":"I was incredibly excited to try Marble Room. The interior and decor are second to none. Absolutely stunning architecture and if you're into wine, the wine cellar is one of a kind. The ambiance was great as well - saxophonist playing table side was a nice touch. 

However, the service was not up to par with the decor. Our waiter took about 10 minutes to come to the table and when he got there he was extremely condescending and rude. 

The food is extremely pricey - which I wouldn't normally mind, but it was not good enough to be priced so high. I got the scallops and they weren't cleaned so they were very grainy and they were also chewy and over cooked. We also ordered the lobster pasta and although the lobster was good, the pasta was extremely undercooked - far past the desired al dente. The sauce was also very bland. 

I would recommend coming here for a drink but I'd for sure skip the dinner - not worth the price!"}
{"text":"Bittersweet is the best way to explain my Review of the Marble Room. While the Ambience and Tasty King Crab were superb..service was a complete disappointment. My husband and I celebrated out 12 wedding anniversary last night and I thought upon entering the Marble Room that This would be some of the best service and food in Cleveland we could have. Boy was I wrong. Waiter was very dry..didn't ask if food was ok..didn't ask to refill drinks until AFTER I confronted him about his lack of attention..and service. I would hate to say it was because of my skin color I was treated differently..but as I watched him serve a table of fair skinned ppl I had my questions?? Well I guess I'll just continue to patron Ruth Chris"}
{"text":"I experienced the Marble Room this past weekend and had a fantastic experience. The place is amazing. As soon as you walk in you are overtaken by the beauty of the building. All the detail in the architecture is flat out incredible. The experience during dining was so cool. There was a DJ playing instrumentals with a violinist and saxophonist walking around playing along with the DJ. So cool. The service and food were top notch. Got the filet with chimmichurri. Cooked to perfection. This place is a gem. Can't believe it's in my hometown. It is pricey but worth the experience. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I had a cocktail called Love Potion which had no flavor the rock glass was filled with ice and the cocktail was half filled. The drink reminded me of water downed Fruit Punch. After having such a disappointing drink I was not going to have dinner. I definitely will not be back. Overpriced and Overrated."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and the food- both the steaks and the seafood- is always incredible.  The steaks and seafood are always cooked to perfection, and the food never disappoints. However, I'm giving Marble Room 4 stars instead of 5 because of the service.  For the price, service should consistently be incredible, but unfortunately, I have had more than one subpar server here."}
{"text":"This review is for lunch only, I will return at a later date for dinner:-).   I work in the adjoining building and anxiously watched the renovation of the former PNC bank branch.  A co-worker and I visited on a Friday afternoon.  I booked a reservation through Open Table, to ensure that we didn't have to wait.  The restaurant was busy when we arrived.  We were immediately seated and our server approached with water.  He returned a short time later with rolls and proceeded to take our order.   I ordered the chopped salad and a crab avocado sushi roll.  My co-worker ordered the mixed greens salad.  Our lunch arrived quickly.  My chopped salad was a little bit murky looking, but the taste and portion was good.  The crab avocado roll, looked and tasted like a tuna roll, but regardless, it was tasty, as well.  My co-worker enjoyed the mixed greens salad.  The salad was $12 and the roll was $8, which is more than I spend on lunch, on a daily basis, but I would return, for lunch, just not very often.  I am anxious to return for dinner."}
{"text":"My wife hand been dying to go here for the longest so we finally did. The food is good...some of the menu items are fantastic. But the price is a bit steep. I had the shashimi appetizer, great (way overpriced), and the filet, average at best (not with the cost). The atmosphere was ok...great decor. The background music was not that good. From what I'm told, many people prefer sitting at the bar opposed to the dining area. Maybe I'll try that next time. Though this is a three star review, I think I will give it another chance."}
{"text":"The hostess was very rude and said the place was fully committed without any other explanation. 
The place was clearing out and her rudeness is why I will never be back to even try it. We were recommended this place. Not sure why !!!!!!! 
What does fully committed mean when you are not full ? Did they judge us because we game in from the cavs game. Oh well ! 
We were looking to spend lots of money on food and drinks. The people that were in there were far from upscale. Good luck with this place. I give it a year before they close"}
{"text":"Stunning atmosphere! Also stunning: the bill! The food was good not great. Service was terrible. Starting at the bar when we were totally ignored through the slow service during our dinner. There too many other places to spend less with far more professional staff."}
{"text":"This is going to be one of those Good, Bad, and Ugly reviews. Hopefully these folks read their Yelp reviews. My husband and I visited them with my cousin and her boyfriend. It was one of those 'get dressed up and go out' kind of evenings. 

First, the good: I really, reeeeeealllly want to like this place and see it succeed - without selling out. The splendid beauty of the space itself is stunning. It is every bit as upscale as anyplace of the same calibre that I have been to in New York, San Francisco, or Chicago. The food was great, with one exception, I'll get to that later. The wine list is impressive and priced appropriately without being excessive. The sommelier/or manager was attentive and charming.

The bad:  our waitress was awkward and not very literate of the menu which, unfortunately permeated our experience.  The exception to the lovely food was my fois gras appetizer. It read that it's served with funnel cake and season's jam. The perfectly cooked fois gras was complemented wonderfully by the mascerated berry jam. Unfortunately, this delight was served on a giant funnel cake almost twice the size of my fist. Now, I don't normally eat things that are fried in a  vat. I thought I'd be getting a much, muuuuuuuch smaller confection that would be an interesting twist, not going against my own dietary grain.  To me, the abundance of fried pastry was gross and vulgar. I actually and quietly told the aforementioned sommelier/manager that it was an abomination to treat such a lovely goose liver, it was removed from our check. 

The ugly:  the television screens above the bar.  The last thing this place needs is a fucking tv!  It cheapens the experience - which, for four of us with a bottle of champagne before dinner and wine with - was anything but cheap. The tv downgrades the atmosphere and tone they appear to desire to create. I know, I've heard it all before. Cleveland is a sports town, blah blah blah. Cleveland is a working class town, blah blah blah. I have news for Cleveburg...not everyone buys into your over hyped gladitorial traditions, and once you breach the threshold of $2000 rent you can kiss your blue collar pride good bye. 

 The other ugly thing was the 'music's. The evening we were there, they had a couple of 'roaming minstrels' who, most unfortunately were playing along to a recorded track.  In other circumstances that could work, but not in the cavernous environment of a glorious Beaux Arts bank building. I'm not going to elaborate much. Needless to say the combination provided for a disjointed sound that was horribly loud at table side. There is a beautiful central staircase in the rear of the room, setting a perfect stage for musicians to perform, and stay put. 

All said, we will be returning in a few months to see how things settle in after they've been open for a little while."}
{"text":"Incredible new addition to the Cleveland dining scene. Staff from management on down was highly attentive.  The venue is drop dead gorgeous and maintains all the grandeur of the former bank lobby.  The restaurant still felt very cozy given the table configuration.   Our party had raw oyster appetizers and salads which hit the mark.  The Hudson Valley duck and fois gras were fantastic. Aged Delmonico steaks were perfectly cooked with a little outside char but moist and tender inside.  The salmon sushi rolls were killer.  Finally the king crab fried rice was inventive and a great side.  All in all this is a perfect spot that will likely get harder to get in as the word gets out."}
{"text":"From the moment we entered the Marble Room, we felt transported to one of the most beautiful dining experiences in Northeast Ohio. Every attention to detail was paid in the restoration of this historic architectural gem. Our highly skilled, well-trained, affable serving team of Keith and Netta made us feel like royalty, explaining the menu and helping us narrow down our choices from the many delicious-sounding options. We sampled offerings from the raw bar (seafood sampler and oysters) and they were fresh and delicious. The steak tartare  was  as  beautiful as  it was flavorful, and the bone-in ribeye was exactly as ordered. Unique and satisfying sides of crab fried rice and sauteed mushrooms with truffle butter were big enough to share. We were going to skip dessert, but our server's description of the mango panna cotta was irresistible. The textures and flavors combined to provide the perfect ending to a perfect meal. A large brandy snifter layered with the fruit, custard, and crunch was topped by a white chocolate disc though which our server poured a warm caramel sauce, and  we appreciated the two large spoons to enable us to savor every bite. This was truly a magnificent dining experience."}
{"text":"Long story short: awesome but pricy steaks and sides in a GORGEOUS restaurant converted from an old historical bank. Parking kinda sucks.

Ambience: This place is beautiful and has to be one of the most beautiful restaurants in all of Cleveland. Converted from an old bank!

Food: Steaks were a little underdone but still delicious. Filet was one of the most tender I've had and the delmonico was great as well. Went well with their house steak sauce which was a little sweet. Free bread and whipped butter on the side. Roasted cauliflower was my favorite side and the truffle fries were crispy and came with ketchup, pesto aoli, and chipotle aoli. We also got the king crab fried rice which was so NOT worth it. It was overdone and the crab was a bit overcooked.

Service: Our waiter was okay. He took our orders and brought us our food. And that's about all he did. 

Parking: Valet is available; slim pickings in downtown. We were able to find a street parking spot around the corner on 9th Street.

Price: Pricy! $175 including tip for 2 people including 2 steaks and 3 sides (no drinks). Includes free bread and whipped butter. 

Location: Great location in downtown Cleveland!"}
{"text":"It was okay. We had reservations, it was on a Thursday. We waited over a half hour to be seated and ended up being seated in the bar. Spacious area but took away from the experience. People next to us at the bar were complaining about their reservation running over a half hour over as well. Server was nice, but it felt like they were very rehearsed and it made it almost awkward. Everything had to be read off the menu didn't seem like they knew it or the specials that well. Did NOT feel like a fine dining experience whatsoever so I wouldn't take people there for that type of experience. Especially when spending so much money. The place is very pretty it could be a good place for a cocktail at the bar. I do have to commend the bartender when he saw we were all over our wait time he went to the hostess stand checking in on what was going on. Side note- some of the attire the women staff members were wearing made the place seem cheaper"}
{"text":"Simply outstanding venue, food, and service. We went to Marble Room for date night on the recommendation of a colleague and I can't express enough how much Marble Room knocked it out of the park. 

The venue - set in an old bank style building the high ceilings, marble walls, and creative use of space (from wine rooms to entertainment balconies) were beautifully done. The acoustics could use some fine tuning but I believe it was because of where we were sitting, and the fact that the restaurant was at capacity. During our dinner they had two musicians - a violinist and saxophone player - walking around serenading the tables. Super cool little touch that made a big impact. 

The food - bar none, the best food fine dining we've had. Our appetizer of Wagyu Beef topped sushi was AMAZING. The dinner portions (I had a large steak and two sides) were extremely generous. The steak was cooked perfectly and worth every penny of the $100 price tag. Side dishes were enough for 2-3 people to share so we ended up with a fair amount left over. Everything about from the flavor, precise meat temperatures, to presentation of dish was perfectly executed. 

The service - despite being jam packed with a wait our drinks were routinely refilled and the ticket times were just right from appetizer to main course. Waiters were knowledgeable, pleasant, and patient. 

I'd 100% recommend this to anyone looking for a top quality fine dining experience with two notes:

1) The food is not cheap, but it's worth every penny you pay and you will not leave disappointed. Expect to spend $80+ per person. Our bill was close to $400 for two people including sushi appetizer, two premium steaks, multiple side dishes, and a few drinks each. WORTH IT!

2) The portions are very generous so be sure to ask the wait staff about plate sizes, sharing recommendations, etc."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to marble room to celebrate both of our birthdays and it was wonderful! The food was amazing and the service was top of the line! Thomas was our waiter and he was so kind and attentive. Not to mention the atmosphere is so cool. There is nothing else like this in Cleveland! I defiantly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"great experience from start to finish. excellent service, amazing food, and the interior design is beautiful, grand architectural elements blended with chic furnishings, felt like you were back in roaring 20s. well worth it for a quick drink at the bar or a fancy night out with your special someone."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended the marble room and this restaurant did not dissapoint. We started with a seafood appetizer that was a three level tower of the freshest tasting seafood I have ever eaten. The Maine course a large flank steak and a prime rib were the best tasting beef and that includes the time I spent in Texas trying several of the \"best steak houses\" in the country. Unfortunately I was to full to try the dessert. The service was also on point my glass stayed full and the management made a couple passes by our table to check our satisfaction. What a pleasure in an era of less service to actually get more is a treat,"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so special, went here with my husband for a special night out. Food was just so delicious and so tastefully prepared. The ambiance's beautiful just a wonderful place."}
{"text":"This is the real deal from the moment you walk in the front door (valet parking out front) to desert and a coffee to finish things up.  The venue is spectacular, the food just as good with service hitting the trifecta. Bone in rib-eye was excellent, a handful of items from the raw bar all fresh and paired with some unique sauces.  Pricey but you get what you pay for.  I was in town on business and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ridiculous and sexist service. A bus boy spilled my plate on my brand new bcbg outfit ($400) I was given a card with an email address on it to send the dry cleaning bill too. THEN my friends card was decided due to fraudulent charges and while she was working it out on the phone the owner came up to the table demanding \" collateral for the bill\". Disgusting with the service from management. Hostess were great."}
{"text":"I went in for dinner on 9/11/17. I sat at the bar and started with the tartar, which was perfectly prepared . Then had the Voyage of Discovery. It was the most perfect cocktail I ever had. I ordered another. The bartenders were so friendly and eager to talk to me about the menu. Lefty, Colleen and Lou are awesome. They were all busy but never too much to check in on me. 
I had the scallops for my entree. The barley risotto was interesting and very tasty. 
I'd come back again. What a nice experience."}
{"text":"Had the most divine lunch.Service was excellent and the skirt steak was superb. Ambiance  was lovely, can't wait to return."}
{"text":"By far one of the best steaks I've ever had! My fiancé and I started by splitting the wedge salad then we both got New York strip steaks and split Mac n cheese and a loaded baked potato. All were good but I would skip to potato! The Mac and cheese may have also been the best Mac and cheese I've ever had"}
{"text":"5 stars for ambiance and architecture. Some of it they can take credit for but most of it was done decades ago. This is one of the finest places we have seen in our Iives. Too bad the food doesn't match the same standard. 

3 stars for the entrees. Extremely salty, and mediocre at best. We ordered the rainbow trout, steaks, potato gratin and roasted cauliflower sides. All the items were mediocre. 

5 stars for service 

4 stars for dessert, we got Baked Alaska."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, it's not that I was disappointed by any means- I just had REALLY high expectations of this Marble Room. Mostly, because of the Lockkeeper's brand as well as the menu and the prices. I subsequently wish we could leave half star reviews because mine is more like a 3.5 star rounded up to 4 BECAUSE 1) they just opened and need the constructive criticisms along with the praises 2) it was our first time and 3) I'd really like to go back and I'm not sure we will or not, as is. 

The AMAZING: 
The building renovations themselves...this space is SPECTACULAR. And extravagant, to say the least. For this alone I wish I could give them five stars. This really is a gem that deserves both appreciation and admiration. Our server, Nettle, was also incredible. You could see the excitement in her face & attitude that she \"got\" to work there. Our drinks were never empty and one time she even hid around the corner to wait for me to take my last sip before removing the empty glass from the table... that's awesome :p We also really appreciated the presentation, across the board, of our dishes. The only one that was a little odd was the presentation of the Alaskan King Crab legs. Disclaimer: you literally get one leg. A leg. Not a claw, a leg.  Just a consideration for anyone who expects to be full after this entree. And it was just the crab meat in a serving dish, kind of sad looking, not being in the shell or anything lol. Delicious and perfectly steamed, nonetheless. I forget the name, but they're also really proud of where they source their meat from. Hubby got the rib-eye and it was melt in your mouth uh-mazing. Really, all the food was awesome (we got the pomme frites - they're thicker cut like steak fries, NE oysters, and the asparagus.) 

The Bad: 
The space is huge, the chairs are huge (comfy but they make you feel really far away from the person you're sitting with at a two-top) and the menus are huge (where do I put it when I'm done... how do I hold this thing? Holy crap it's a task to flip the pages of the wine list.)  They kept the place pretty lit so it really wasn't as \"intimate\" of an experience as I was expecting. It had more of a club like feel for a Saturday night. 

The Ugly:
Okay, this place is REALLY expensive (I would save the average entree price is $38 and sides are a la carte) and we were prepared for that. And it's owned by Lockkeeper's (which I've been too before so that's where my expectation was set.) The servers were dressed in ties and vests and most of the guests were dressed UP. The tables have white linens. There was a saxophone player. This place is FANCY. So please tell me why they were letting people in with baseball hats, shorts, and flip flops after the baseball game? I understand you are new to the area and want to drive people to come here but this was a bit offensive, when we were in a suit jacket and LBD to respect the place! They spent way too much money on this place and have way too expensive of menu prices to not have a dress code. It really distracted us and made us question the atmosphere they are hoping for. The music was SOOO loud. Club music, loud (they have a DJ after all) and it was really confusing because they also had a live saxophone player. We would go from having to LITERALLY yell at eachother across the table (I mentioned earlier how big the chairs/tables are...you're a bit of a distance away from your person) to it being quiet/brightly lit again. 

I really would like to see a dress code (unless this is the atmosphere they're going for...then the menu/prices need considered) as well as more relaxing dinner music and levels so we could sit back and appreciate the building for all of it's glory. It would really help to dim the lights and add some candles to the tables to help create the ambiance! Because of the ambiance and menu prices I don't foresee us going back anytime soon... but will keep our eye on the reviews to see if anything changes :) I am sure we will be in for a drink and appetizer at the bar though, just to enjoy the space."}
{"text":"This part is just for the bar area

I happened to go to the Marble Room twice within 4 days. I loved the space, the food and the server I had the first time. The second time I went, we just stopped by to have a drink. The bar was packed and the 6(ish) tables in the bar area were packed. Good for you! So be prepared to wait for a spot if you go but the drinks and food were very good. 

Dinner
My fiancé took me out for dinner for my birthday. We ordered crab legs and some raw fish special (I cannot remember the Japanese name - sorry) which both were amazing. The side of asparagus was done perfectly. I could not decide on a wine and was recommended an amazing Chardonnay. Our server was very attentive, professional and made the effort to have just the right amount of small talk so we felt like we truly mattered to him. His conduct only added to make the dinner date feel very special. 

Ok - my reason for not giving you 5 stars - which from a culinary standpoint, architectural standpoint and service standpoint you totally deserve: the music 
The live violin and saxophone are too loud and if you come more than once, it kind of feels a little repetitive and \"old\".
Especially in the bar area the volume of the speakers makes a conversation almost impossible. The space also causes an echo and delay between the background music and the live performers 

I really hate being so picky and give you a hard time  
Change the music and I will give you five stars."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Cleveland by far. Breathtaking ambiance with the food to match. I highly recommend any of the raw bar items. We got the seafood tower for two and devoured the whole thing. The fish and chips roll is also excellent. The restaurant is on par with restaurants in NYC, Miami, etc. Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Have to say this is the swankiest place in Cleveland! The look and feel is such a cool combo of old classic elegance and modern chic. And, the food - hands down, the best steaks. Our service was exceptional too. We got a little Flambé Baked Alaska envy when we saw it served at a nearby table, we had to have it, and it was worth every calorie"}
{"text":"PROS
-Opulent and nostalgic setting. The exterior of the restaurant does not have windows, so you do have to go inside to see the wonder of the space. Cathedral ceilings, original marble work, and swanky furniture reminiscent of days gone by. Just the view of the place makes your jaw drop.
-Solid steaks. I got the 6oz filet and it was cooked perfectly. Paired it with the pomme frites which come with three dipping sauces (and they were all fantastic).
-Drink wine. It's very clear they know their wines here - it is literally stacked to the ceiling. We got a bottle (okay two bottles) of Kunde Cabernet Sauvignon and it was fantastic.
-Service. Yes, service. I know Marble Room has been grilled in the press lately for some sub-par service. However, our waitress was on point. I told her when we sat down that we were going to see a show and she kept us on track and got our food when we needed it and got us out right on time.

CONS
-Reservation limitations. I usually use Open Table to book reservations and typically, if you have a party of 6 or more, you have to call to make a reservation. In this case, I couldn't make a reservation over a party of 4. And even when I called to make a reservation for 6, the woman I talked to had to get permission to book a party that size. 

BOTTOM LINE
-I'll be coming back here for my next big night out on the town!"}
{"text":"Well I will start this by saying this is probably the best Resturant in Cleveland.  The room is mesmerizing and makes you feel like your in a surreal place.  The food is very pricey but everything was top notch from the drinks to the steaks, which are probably amazing the best in town.

With all that said and why I did not give 5 stars, the service is spotty.  The greeting at the door was bad, we waited too long to order drinks and they took forever.  The waiter was nice but not what you would expect when paying this much.  They definitely need to tune up service and this will be by far the best in town."}
{"text":"This is her second visit and our general conclusion is the food is OK and the atmosphere is very good to excellent.
We had a table of six last night and arrived at 6:15 PM. We were immediately informed by the server that they were out of all specials. 
Wine list is very extensive and reasonable. Many choices. Manu is pricey but not excessively so considering it's a steakhouse. I ordered the trout and it arrived very fishy and strong. They replaced it and because of the wait they volunteered to not charge me for it.  My wife had a fillet mignon which was delivered on a plate with no much is a sprig of parsley to accompany it. Side dishes are generally 10 to $14.
If you're looking for a special occasion restaurant with a beautiful atmosphere and are not concerned about the food being exceptional this may be for you."}
{"text":"I went to the Marble Room for dinner this weekend.  I expected a nice dinner but what I got was a wonderful and lovely experience.  The restaurant is beautiful.  They did an excellent job restoring it.  Everyone talks about the saxophonist in their reviews and they are right.  What a great added touch!  

I had the Delmonico steak and a chopped salad.  My husband had the Yellowfin Tuna Poke Bowl.  It was delectable and delicious.  We also ordered Au gratin potatoes.  They were very salty.  The waitress apologized and took care of it for us.  

We received a tour of the restaurant and it is very nice.  I will more than likely host a party or a business dinner at the Marble Room."}
{"text":"WOWIE. What an epic space. This restaurant just opened in the old National City Bank and it is full of charm. High ceilings, chandeliers, and cool nook-and-crannys meant for meetings but subbed for dining tables, this place transports you to a classier time. 

Feeling like Don Draper walking in, I had to order a cocktail with lunch. The bartender was extremely friendly and suggested the Voyage to Discovery ($14). I went for it and was delighted. Perfect for summer, the tequilla is well balanced by mint and ginger beer. 

Nice touch: they provide complimentary fresh, warm bread with butter. The bread has a great texture and is warm enough so the butter melts into its crevices. To go along with the bread, I ordered the curry coconut shrimp sushi roll ($16). They serve the soy sauce in a cute teapot and the plating of the sushi is creative and appetizing. The sushi was tasty and the curry sauce really complimented it well.

A very satisfying, indulgent experience for all 6 senses. Will be back again for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and we were celebrating our 28th wedding anniversary.  Aesthetically spectacular - this place reminds us of Monoco, really, it does. The vibe even at that time of the evening was electric.
We took a 6:15pm reservation as we had other plans for the evening. Valet parking was almost $20 - (ouch) but it was professional. Took no time to get seating in a booth located in a nook. The booth felt like a private room with soaring 20ft ceilings and side curtains. I have seen some cranky reviews about service and food so I was a bit apprehensive. I think the management of the restaurant is working hard to iron out the kinks (after all it has only been open since Sept 2017) Our server was Ken - This guy was perhaps the most professional, friendly, engaging waiter we have had in a long time. He took us through the menu, the cocktails and made recommendations. I had the seafood sampler appetizer and my wife had the Foi Gra. Exceptional!!!!  Then we had to determine which was better: Bone-In Ribeye or Dry Aged Delmonico. Again, an engaging discussion with Ken - He suggested the Dry Aged for more flavor, less fuss with the bone. My wife took the Delmonico, I the bone- in - hers was more tasty. Both were grilled to absolute perfection. We each selected a glass of Quilt by Caymus from their comprehensive wine list - yummy. Desert was the chocolate cake and coffee. We so enjoyed the evening. To top it off - the restaurant had a violinist and sax player roaming around playing accompaniment to the sound track of the evening. Apologies for gushing - We will most definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The Marble Room provides a fabulous dining experience inclusive of all that you may expect in fine dining; as well as a very nice wine selection. The ambience is worldly aesthetic; it's easy to forget you are in downtown Cleveland. Instead, it feels more like Europe. I need to give a 5-star shout out to our host Ashley for a fabulous end to our near perfect evening!"}
{"text":"The wife and I came here for our 14th anniversary, our second attempt, the first time they shooed us away because we didn't make reservations.
I wasn't gonna make that mistake twice.
Sometimes I feel like most of these upscale  steakhouses serve more fish then steak. ( I know I know it's a raw bar but still..)
The bad:
Limited menu like you would expect from a fancy steak house. No mashed potatoes, no French fries no French onion soup.
The music was too loud and we sat too close to the sushi bar , it smelled like a fish market .
The good : The food was amazing.
The $58 bone in strip was to die for . The cream corn was better then Hyde Parks. The coco curry sushi was delicious, even the bread and butter was awesome. I really enjoyed the food.
I thought I wouldn't enjoy it  because the menu was so limited and there were too many ingredients I didn't like, but I was pleasantly surprised .
It was expensive, but good.
Better then Fleming's and Hyde park, but not better then Lannings."}
{"text":"The place was spectacular! No complains at all! Although they have just opened, the service was great and food delicious  go and check this place!"}
{"text":"Had another off the hook meal here while in Cleveland for the NCAA tournament.  What a great place.  I've never been in such an amazing restaurant venue before regardless of the city.  The food is outstanding.pricey but well worth it.

I had a perfect Nw York steak, killer sides including this potatoes crisp, cauliflower and an awesome wedge salad.  

I'm not big on dessert but we decided to splurge and get this custard parfait type thing that was really unique and outstanding."}
{"text":"Honestly, I cannot think of a move impressive restaurant space in Cleveland. The restaurant owners have taken a glorious, pubic banking space  (building is from 1896, but the banking hall was remolded for National City Bank by Walker & Weeks in 1915), and sensitively evolved that space into an vibrant, intimate and intoxicating venue. You may forget that you are here to eat and drink... you eyes are treated at every turn with rich offerings of carved Corinthian columns, coffered ceilings, magnificent chandeliers, cast brass and bronze original fixtures, inviting sexy stairways... all treasures to discover throughout your visit. 

Our group of 7 experienced perfect service from start to finish... from the valet, to the hostess, on to the server... even the bussers were polished and polite. 

Balanced and well thought out wine list. The champagne magnums and wine offerings tease you from above the bar on the second level where they have been installed in a temp controlled room. The food menu offerings are just right... not an exhaustive list, but again well-considered offerings. Our table had everything from grilled trout, salmon poke bowl, chicken dish to steaks... all perfect. My skirt steak was just exploding with taste, perfectly grilled and actually quite memorable. 

The joy of eating in this space is the longer you stay, the more it reveals itself to you... little jewels of the architect's vision from 103 years ago, are offered up to you as you sit and sip from a glass or take a bite to contemplate the lushness of a great steak. 

It's a unique pleasure when excellent food and masterful architecture pair so well together."}
{"text":"The staff was great . Was iffy after reading reviews but looks like they got some training . The aged Delmonico steak was out of this world. Melt in your mouth !!! Roared cauliflower and Mac and cheese out of this world. The price is right for the best food !!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday evening with friends and it was my wife's birthday. The ambiance was phenomenal. The oysters were just ok. The food was great, the service was good. We were sitting in one of the booths, which are very nice and comfortable. The only negative during our dinner was the volume of the background music was so loud we had difficulty hearing our conversations. We asked to have the volume lowered and the server said she would request to have the volume lowered, but it never was turned down. The speakers are right next to the booths.... bad idea. 
The genre was not what you would expect in a upscale restaurant."}
{"text":"In the old Citi Bank building, the atmosphere and interior decor is among the best around.  Gorgeous.

We enjoyed a great service and fantastic dinner. Delicious and well done baby kale salad and salmon dish.  Congrats."}
{"text":"Tasty . . . Scrumptious . . . Elegant . . . The food was beyond my expectations and the service was on par for the caliber of restaurant. The server was gracious to give a tour of the elaborate and posh vault. Ok, the steak was cooked to perfection and the Mac and cheese reminded me of liquid gold. If you have not tried this place for dinner, you are truly missing out on a new gem in CLE."}
{"text":"This place is such a treat and the inside is absolutely gorgeous. All the detail, the decor, tall ceilings and overall vibe are on point. The live saxophone and violin players are just the cherry on top! I've been here twice now and it's great for special occasions. We went for my fiance's birthday and had a wonderful experience. 

The food is delicious and so are the handcrafted drinks! It is definitely on the expensive side (around $40-100 per person depending on what you order to eat and drink.) My fiance started off with the seafood sampler and was raving about it ($30 a person.) He had the Delmonico steak and potato cake for dinner and I had the Yellowfin tuna bowl. It was soooo good!! I tried his steak and potato and together they were melt in your mouth! It's so fun to dress up and come here for a magical night!! It reminds me of a restaurant that you would find in Vegas or NYC."}
{"text":"Excellent steaks! I came here for dinner by myself and started off with the surf and turf roll and a Marble Room mojito. Their take on the mojito is delicious- it has strawberries and cucumbers in it, making it fruity and fresh. The surf and turf roll was good, but it needed a better meat-to-seafood ratio. The seafood overpowered the meat, making it more of an afterthought. I've had better surf and turf rolls, and I was disappointed by this. Per my server's suggestion [Chloe], I ordered the Delmonico steak. The marbling was perfect, and I didn't even need a steak topper. I had the Mac and cheese for my side, which was giant and amazing. You really can't go wrong with truffle oil. I paired my steak with a lovely Oberon Cabernet Sauvignon, again per Chloe's suggestion. I finished off my meal with the mandarin orange and yuzu cheesecake, which was actually very good. It had a tasty coconut sorbet on top, and the dessert was very light and a good combination of flavors, although the yuzu syrup on the side could be a little overpowering. 

I gave this place four stars because although Chloe gave me stellar service, she mentioned that she was assisting Scott in serving me that night. Scott stopped by only twice and barely asked how I was doing, which I found off-putting. A few managers stopped by to ask how I was doing but it definitely felt more like a courtesy ask instead of genuinely trying to figure out if I was enjoying myself or had any suggestions. I had a pretty good experience overall, although I did feel like I was being dismissed since I was younger and by myself.

If anything, it's worth coming here for the steaks and the beautiful interior. I came back the next day for lunch and the salmon dish was pretty good. Not as good as the steaks, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Wow. This is truly one of the most amazing spaces in Cleveland. High ceilings, marble, and beautiful decor. It's worth stopping in for a drink just to take it all in. We have been excited to go here for awhile, and it finally happened! We made reservations for lunch for our friends birthday. 

We started with drinks. I had the Millenial Dream, kind of just ordered it for the name. It was extremely sweet but very potent. We started with a salmon avocado sushi roll. So fresh!! We got the cutest little pot of soy sauce to go with the roll. They also delivered fresh sourdough bread to the table. 

For the main entree, I had the vegetable fried rice with king crab. Absolutely delicious. It's not a dish I expected from such a fancy restaurant - but I'm so happy I did it!! The 4 of us shared the Mac and cheese dish as well - it was so rich, but so delicious... we had much leftover. For dessert, we all shared the chocolate cake. Phenomenal.

Service was top notch. Valet was just as much as parking in the nearby garage. Overall, our experience was so great. I can't wait to go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"I went w my husband for our anniversary and our first visit was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. The place is stunning. The interior maximizes the  historic beauty of the building. Our waiter was a delight and the food was delicious. It managed to be 5 star fancy without being overly fussy and formal in a bad way. There was a violin player that appeared on the balcony and as we were leaving Lebron James came in! I don't know how I could pick a dining choice next anniversary that could top this..."}
{"text":"The place is huge and it's really hard for them to fill the restaurant.
Food was ok, i had the seafood pasta, well cooked but a way too expensive for the quality. 
The by the glass wine list is awful. Any French or Italian option. Only grocery stores wines options from California ... 
I was really disappointed about their wine list. It seems they do not have a sommelier or someone taking care of that."}
{"text":"A very beautiful and special place!  Best atmosphere in Cleveland, I would say.  The perfect spot for a special birthday or anniversary!  We will definitely be returning...."}
{"text":"Beautiful and elegant! The decor is very nice and grand providing for a wonderful atmosphere. The menu provides a little bit of everything and I love that they have their take on some sushi. The filet was wonderful and sushi was good too! My only complaint was the exceptionally displeased hostess who was far from friendly. As your first time to a place where expectations are as high as they can get, you want to be peacefully greeted to start off your experience. Despite that, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Was debating between 2 and 3 stars. The decor and setting was incredible and deserve 3 stars on its own account. I have to say it's one of the most beautiful restaurants I have set foot in. On the other end though, the food is really disappointing, even more so because the setting was so nice! 
It was SALTY, almost unbearably salty. I had the crab cake for appetizer, and I swear there were salt chunks in there. Steak would've been great if the saltiness didn't overwhelm the flavor. Sushi roll was alright but it's just bland --- maybe my palates were just saturated. 
Also, I like the concept of live music, but it was way too loud that I can't hardly hear ppl across the table..."}
{"text":"Stunning space, mediocre food, okay service.  Worth going for a drink and small plates, but they need to improve on service (particularly with host staff and reservations) and quality of food."}
{"text":"We have dined twice at the Marble Room.  Once for my wife's birthday and another time with the family.  Both were exceptional.  Our first time, my wife were lucky enough to sit in Joey's section.  We were seated at a 2 top along the columns.  We were hesitant at first, thinking we wanted a more private booth, but the table was perfect.  Joey took care of us like no other.  We had an early reserve and ended up staying late.  Jonathan the manager came by and chatted with us for quite awhile.  The food, the setting, the service, the Violinist! made for an amazing night.  Our second evening with the family was just as wonderful.  This is definitely a restaurant for a special occasion."}
{"text":"It's seems like this is the new \"hot\" spot in Cleveland so I was anticipating giving it a shot while in town. I will absolutely say the ambiance and building itself lived up to the hype. The food & drinks, however, were unremarkable. Everything on the menu sounded extraordinary but the execution of the dishes was just mediocre. The service was also subpar. I would expect a restaurant such as this to have impeccable service. I also would expect the servers to be knowledgeable about the food menu AND the drink menu. Our server this past Saturday night was not knowledgeable about either and when we asked questions she didn't make eye contact, she simply continued pressing away at her iPad on her serving tray & didn't offer to even find an us an answer. The prices are just too high for what it actually is. The bill for two people was $200 before gratuity and we ordered lightly!! I truly expected to be treated exceptionally well and to have a meal my tastebuds would remember. I walked out disappointed. If I was judging on the food, drinks and service alone, Marble Room would have gotten 1 star. I've given an extra 2 stars for the ambiance. From somebody that KNOWS proper customer service, Marble Room, step-up the training of your staff!! They need to constantly be tested on the food/drink menu & also be taught proper etiquette. Hold your servers to a higher standard. If I had loved my server, I may have stayed longer, ordered more than 2 drinks and not noticed how mediocre our dishes were."}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday solely for the experience. Although the prices are outrageous, it was an amazing time worth every dime because it's the kind of once a year for a big occasion kind of restaurant. 

I was pleasantly surprised about how friendly the staff was. We were the youngest ones in the entire restaurant and no one treated us any different which was very refreshing, especially in a atmosphere like this.

The food was absolutely delicious. We started off with the Beef Tartar which was perfectly seasoned with the right amount of food, the salmon roll which was melt in your mouth delicious. We then moved to dinner. I had the King Crab (1 pound) and I was licking my plate. It was perfection. My husband had the New York Strip and was so happy while our friends had the filet. 

My friend ordered the filet \"Pittsburgh Rare\" which basically means put it on the grill 30 seconds each side and call it a day. To sum up, he likes it still beating. Anyway - when he received it, it was well done. Complete opposite of what he was looking for. They were so apologetic that they gave him a brand new steak with an extra bone marrow on top. Our waitress felt so bad but we didn't mind as long as it was fixed and it was without a hiccup. 

The sides are large enough to share among us four. We had the brussels sprouts which were legit to die for, potatoes, and mac and cheese (which I swear my husband was going to order four more). 

Overall, the drinks and food were delicious but there is no place more gorgeous in Cleveland then the Marble Room. Totally worth the price for the amazing experience you will have."}
{"text":"Parking- there is a charge of $13 to Valet, however trying to find parking around there looks terrible, so well worth it to just Valet.

First impressions- WOW! You walk through the double glass doors into an elegant marble world. 40-50 foot ceilings, huge columns, ornate decoration on practically everything. 

Drinks- the wine list is MASSIVE. There is an upstairs, all glass wine vault and you can watch the servers go up and down to get the bottles. The drinks are all top shelf and perfectly made. My only complaint was the actual wine list was a huge book that was actually a bit too big to open at the table we were at without knocking over glasses.

Sides- Everything on the menu is a la carte, so if you want something in addition to your entree, you order it separately. The sides are shareable though. We got a side of the bacon roasted brussle sprouts, the roasted cauliflower which was mixed with almonds and raisins, and the crispy potato cake (my favorite!)

Entree- Marble Room is a steak and seafood restaurant and as such, that is what dominates their menu. I got the 8oz Filet, and it was probably the best steak I have ever had. It was the perfect mid rare, buttery, and so tender I barely needed a knife! I got the fresh creamy horseradish to go with it which was the perfect accompaniment. My wife got the scallops, and they were amazing. Wonderful flavor, and served over a bed of barley risotto and lemon asparagus.

Dessert- we tried the Vanilla Bean Creme Brûlée with cinnamon cream and raspberries and it was exquisite. The couple we were with tried the Banana-Mango Panna Cotta which had a white chocolate topper on the glass it was served and they poured salted caramel on it tableside to melt through the chocolate which was fun.

Service- Top Notch! You want for nothing. Our waiter was an expert on the menu, and made you feel more like you had a private Butler than a server. When you get up from the table they hurry over and refill your napkin at your spot so it's nice when you come back.

Entertainment- Live entertainment included a violinist and a saxophonist who walked the restaurant table to table while playing.

Price- You get what you pay for. Don't expect to come here as a couple and pay less than a few hundred dollars for your experience. The cocktails are $12-15, sides are $11-21 per side, meals that aren't steak are on average $35-45, steaks are $45-65 with some going over $100, and one in particular, the Miyazaki Kobe Strip Loin going for $20 per oz with a 4 oz minimum. Any accompaniments for your meal are an extra $3-5. Desserts were $10-16. Totally worth the price as what you are getting is absolute quality.

My only bad experience was the Espresso machine was down so could not get Espresso or Cappuccino with my dessert. 

Overall- 5 Star without a doubt. Would HIGHLY recommend the Marble Room!"}
{"text":"Last night I had the opportunity to visit this beautiful place located in the heart of downtown Cleveland.  When I walked in I was floored by the set-up and how lovely the restaurant was inside.  My first stop of course was the bar.  The bartender was very friendly and made me the perfect Bittersweet Symphony ($12) which came in a martini glass.  I was there for waiting on friends and wanted to celebrate a birthday at the same time.  Well, I found out that in order to bring cake into the restaurant and cut it, you will be charged $5 per slice for cutting and sharing cake at this facility.   During the night, we had 2 young ladies named Jordan help with orders and service while we sat in the lounge area up front.  There was a light crowd (week night) but everyone was so friendly and wished my friend a \"happy birthday\" as they passed by the lounge area.  However, towards the end of the night an older gentleman and friend came to talk and have a great time with the group of friend there.  By the end of the night, seven friends and two extra men we didn't know were having a great time.  One gentlemen even bought a bottle of Champagne for the group ($150) which we shared and laughed until almost time to go.  Our server Jordan (African American) was AWESOME, SUPERB and had the best personality that any server could have.  However, we notice the other Jordan (Caucasian) walking back and forth monitoring to see if the cake had been cut (I say that jokingly but it's true).  Cake cut and shared with anyone who wanted a slice in the restaurant.  As we are preparing to leave and everyone has already paid there bill, here comes Jordan (Caucasian) handing the bday girl her cake bill.  I was astonished!  My bill alone was $50 with two drinks, a burger and tip!  Someone else paid $60, etc  I couldn't believe we had spent high priced cash and she handed her a $25 tab.  I asked her why she was still charging if the bill here was already close to over $400 in this area and she said \"I told you I would\" .  That's not really where the problem lies.....She actually stood there and waited for the money to be place in the bill fold.  When I asked her why she was still standing around in the area she stated that she was waiting on the money and to see if she needed change.   When I asked her to leave the area she told me that she wasn't leaving until she received the money and check if she need change.  At this point it got ugly because I told her she was just standing in the area to be rude and unprofessional....Guess what?! She didn't move and became confrontational.  In such a classy place, I couldn't believe that a dressed up staff member would behave in that manner.  I will not be returning to the Marble Room just based on the unprofessional actions of Ms. Jordan.  No guess some be subjected to rude and confrontational behavior from a business where I spend my money.  Obviously, she's never worked in the hospitality business because she had no hospitality.  It was that one bad apple that spoiled my experience.  Nonetheless, the food was really good."}
{"text":"I cannot quite describe how absolutely stunning the Marble Room is. My husband and I had dinner here to celebrate his match day and we were blown away. The high ceilings, minimal decor, and the sheer elegance made this a night to remember. The staff are professional and friendly which only added to the elegance.

Dinner was an experience full of delights! The raw bar station displays all the fresh catch of the day and an array of delectable oysters. The cocktail menu was extensive and had something wonderful for everyone to enjoy. The steak options were limitless and all aged to perfection. My husband and I had oysters, sushi, steak, and side dishes to share. We were in heaven! 

This is a gem in Cleveland that I'm so excited about and I wish them great success!"}
{"text":"An immaculate venue in a building that truly would/could not be built today. The food is good, but I would not say among the best in Cleveland. Blue Pointe, Capital Grille, Red, XO, & Don's Lighthouse all do a better job IMO. With that said, the venue & location do provide for a one-of-a-kind experience."}
{"text":"I wanted to thank the manager and staff for finding room for our party of 12 (then 13) at the last minute on Saturday night. The service was exceptional, the food was delicious, and the setting and ambiance are spectacular. Thanks for a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"Went there for a valentines day lunch, perfect decision.  Our waiter Jeffrey made sure we were comfortable and asked off our dining pace.  We were in for a relaxed long lunch, so it was nice that he asked.  The lycee passion fruit martini was so good, I had two!  Although it was lunch we were allowed to order of the dinner menu just for that day!!  We ordered the oysters for apps, the sauce with the onions went really well with the oysters.  For dinner we got the bone in ribeye cooked medium rare and lobster.  The lobster was so fresh I thought I was back home in Tanzania.  The steak was prepared well but I could do with a lot less charring especially since it was rubbed with an herb.

Definitely going back there again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Unbelievable ambiance, incredible food, great service.  Would absolutely recommend this place to anyone.  The butternut squash soup was so so good.  

Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Wonderful.....definitely sit at the bar to be entertained by Lefty, Colleen, Lenny, Matt,Chris and John.   Appetizers are super.   We'll be back for main course in a few weeks"}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful atmosphere! I came here for drinks and appetizers with a friend and was blown away by how beautiful the architecture is and the ambiance they created! The food was pretty amazing as well. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for Saturday night dinner and will definitely be back. 

Food-The food was INCREDIBLE. We started with the surf n' turf sushi roll, which was seriously the best sushi I have ever had, and the filet, which was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The mac and cheese deserves a shout out as well. Even though it is expensive, you are definitely paying for the quality. 

Experience- Service was good and the decor was amazing. There was a violinist and saxophone player that walked around and interacted with the guests as well. 

Pointers- Make sure you make reservations and request a booth if you plan to mingle. We were placed where there was consistent foot traffic and the noise level at some points got to where we couldn't talk to each other. Plan to spend around 2 hours there as the meals did take awhile to come out."}
{"text":"I adore this old bank turned bar! Came to Cleveland staying downtown looking for a little upscale meets old buildings and this delivered!! It's pricey, but the ambiance, food and service make it worth it in my book!! I had a sushi roll, glass of wine and the creme brûlée at the bar and could have sat their for hours soaking in the space and delicious food."}
{"text":"IT'S FINE.  The steaks are broiled which don't allow for a good rendering of fattier pieces (specifically the ribeye).  Sides are fine.  Sushi is good quality, but nothing interesting or special about it.  The food is all OK but uninspired.    

Bring some work clients, especially if they're older (this place was made for your 67 year old white dad), or if they're 25 and want to feel like a big-timer.   The room is obviously where this place earns its stars.  The vault is also super cool. 

Service was good when we went, so no complaints there."}
{"text":"My husband and I have heard how beautiful this place is and has the best sushi in town.  We also heard that the staffs a bit uppity, food is overpriced, and it's hard to get in.

We must have had really good luck because we didn't experience any of the negatives that were expressed.  

Our meal was delicious, it's exactly what we wanted for a good meal and special occasion.  It is stunning when you walk in.  The tables and seating are a bit unique.  We got a nice booth and enjoyed the room.  

The cocktail menu looked really good as well as the wine list, I was just pooped from work so didn't have a drink sadly and now with regret. 

We started with oysters and got whatever was on special.  They were huge. I don't eat oysters really so the birthday boy ate his heart out happily.  We got the salmon and wagu beef rolls for sushi.  Salmon was delicious, the pineapple salsa was such a good twist.  I enjoyed the wagu roll as well but if I had to pick between the last two pieces I'd take the salmon.  I got a filet per the usual and my husband got a strip.  We both thought the seasoning was on point and perfectly cooked.  We knew we'd be full from the all the apps so we only split one side... the potato pancake with peppers and cotija cheese.  We are glad we did it because it was really one of the only sides that seemed different.  The other sides sounded great as well, it is your traditional sides with a slight enhancement for example mushrooms with truffle butter.  

Was it expensive?  Sure, but it was exactly what I wanted it to be.  I was paying for a delicious meal and a special occasion.  If your worried about splurging I would avoid it because everything is a la carte.  

I can't wait to go back for cocktails and that salmon roll!"}
{"text":"This is a perfect place to go when you're looking to spend a lot of money on a nice meal and feel like you got your money's worth.  The service was fantastic, the food was amazing, and the building itself and the decor is stunning.

Highlights of the meal were the shrimp roll we started with as an appetizer and the king crab fried rice - plus the steaks!  My husband wanted the rice, which is not normally my vibe (shouldn't we get potatoes??), but it was my favorite thing we ate.  The rice was so crispy and well cooked, and the big chunks of crab were delightful.

An array of attire - some people were in suits and dresses, either the after work crowd or a nice night out, but other people were dressed pretty casually (t-shirts, etc.), so we felt comfortable in jeans with dressier tops and shoes."}
{"text":"After all the city's anticipation for another top-notch steak & seafood option, I'll stick with my other go-to's from now on, & so should you. While I can't necessarily my experience at Marble Room was horrible, I can say it was sorely under par.  
**The positives, although most come w/ their downfalls as well - 
--The ambiance. Wow! This place is beautiful! The atmosphere takes your already high expectations up another step, which ultimately doesn't work in their favor. While the tables are gorgeous, the low-top chairs are more of lounge chairs & if you're vertically challenged even slightly, you seem to get lost in them & your head barely reaches above the tables.  
--The beef tartare! Our favorite part of the meal! I'd say they got this right. Actually, their beef in general outdid their seafood in every manner. So if you're going to go, stick to the beef!
**The negatives - 
--Knowledge of staff. Huge disappointment! Let me background the evening for you. Reservations were made for the evening, but I made an extra trip down that afternoon to pick out a bottle of wine as a surprise for the night. I explained to the hostess what I wanted to do & asked if anyone could give me recommendations, as their wine list is quite extensive (& also is numbered, which I'll say is tacky). The hostess said she wasn't sure but I could ask the bartender. When I sat at the bar, I explained what kind I was looking for. While he was very nice, he proceeded to show me wines that were only sold by the glass. He said he would try to find someone else to help me but the servers were all too busy & he again only knew about the wine by glass. It was not a cheap bottle of wine I was looking to buy, & it didn't seem to concern anyone to help me. I ended up having to call a friend & sending her the list to help me out (#524 if you're looking for a great Pinot recommendation, no thanks to them.) It doesn't end there. When we did come in for our reservation, we sat down & the bottle was merely placed on the table. It almost looked like a center piece off to the side. Not only that, but after we almost didn't even notice the bottle, the server came over & stated \"so I don't really know much about the bottle of wine, is something special happening?\"  A presentation of the wine of some sort may have been nice but instead it was honestly a pretty awkward moment. So not only could no one give me a recommendation, which is quite ridiculous for having such an elaborate list & beautiful wine room, but the servers also are winging it at the table.
Next, the food knowledge. I can understand that not every ingredient of an item is listed on the menu but when a guest tells you they have special requests, I'd suggest expanding your knowledge. After ordering the surf-n-turf roll as an app, we asked if there was mayo or aioli inside & after the server checked he stated it did indeed. Fine, our fault for assuming otherwise, but at that moment we stated that one of us could not have mayo at all so all mayo/aioli should be on the side. The server apologized, but again that was our fault for assuming so no hard feelings, until our dinner came out (60 minutes after ordering I might add) with a side of potato cakes that clearly had an aioli over them. We called the server over & he chuckled & said, \"well don't you have a good eye?\"  This was almost offensive, as if we wouldn't notice.  At this point I can say we were over it.  
-Food breakdown- 
1) Beef Tartare - great! loved it! 
2) Surf-n-turf roll - not bad, but unimpressed. The wagyu tataki was delicious (again, stick with the beef) but the lobster seemed to be more like a lobster salad
3) Filet-done as requested but nothing special for the price
4) Rainbow trout-practically flavorless. the toppings were pretty bland but the trout itself was tastless.
5) Broccoli - maybe they forgot the chili and garlic on ours? it tasted like steamed broccoli without anything extra
6) Potato cakes - more like a fried hash brown

Anything more than happy hour at the bar for tartare wouldn't be worth it again."}
{"text":"The welcome to Marble Room was disappointing. While a host did offer coat check before seating me, there were three hostesses present when I arrived and all three were too busy to immediately acknowledge me. 

The USDA filet was good, tender, but undercooked. My friend's strip was similarly undercooked compared to what was requested. I also thought the seasoning of the filet a bit overpowered the natural flavors of the meat. 

The side dish of Crispy Potato Cakes was identified on the menu as a specialty. The serving size was large and designed for just two to share. The flavors were again very strong. While they did go well together they somewhat overpowered the pallet overshadowing whatever was eaten next. The side dish of Brussels Sprouts was good, but the sprouts could have been blackened a bit more. The side dish of King Crab Fried Rice was the best of all 3. 

Our server was friendly, but kept disappearing. His favorite line was \"let me set this down and I'll be right back.\" Right back however meant many things, but never immediacy. 

The space is gorgeous. It was restored and modernized with great attention to detail. However, with a common theme of over seasoning, undercooking and slow service, for $100 per person there are other places to go in Cleveland. While I can see myself returning here, to  try seafood, if I compare the 3 local steakhouses I would first go to Red, then here, and then Urban Farmer."}
{"text":"Sushi and oyster appetizers were delicious. The Mac and cheese was creamy, flavorful, and perfectly crusted on top. We all had filet mignon, I always get mine medium rare and it was just slightly overcooked, not enough to send it back, but noticeable since it is a steakhouse. We waited a bit past our reservation time, but we're able to enjoy drinks at the bar. Bartenders and waiters/waitresses were extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Celebrating my dads birthday tonight. Of course, like at any respectable restaurant we were expecting a celebratory birthday dessert...unfortunately, this photo is not an \"after\" photo. Cake? Ice cream? Nope, just an inedible meringue with a chocolate drizzle happy birthday? Shocking. Next year, Benihana."}
{"text":"This IS the most beautiful restaurant Cleveland has to offer.   The service is exceptional and the seafood items have all been incredible.  If you are a Foie Gras lover this is the best I have had in years.   Definitely a must do!"}
{"text":"Went here twice over the Holidays and had two totally different experiences. Friday night, 9:15 reservation, extremely busy, had wonderful service, food was brought out well-timed, there was live music, never kept waiting for drinks or water refills. Came back the following Tuesday evening, 8:15 reservation, place was pretty dead, service was Terrible. Waited almost 25 minutes for our drinks, our server disappeared after we ordered food, literally never saw him again, had to stop people passing by the table just to get a spoon for soup, water, order a second drink, get the check etc. Was very disappointed after such a positive first go. Sounds odd, but would only go on a busy Friday or Saturday, avoid on dead week nights at all costs.  Should be said that food was delicious both nights with generous portions, so if you're ordering very expensive take out by all means go for it."}
{"text":"The newest restaurant in downtown Cleveland just opened on 9/5. Very excited to visit. The interior is truly gorgeous and spectacular. 

Went for lunch time. Ordered butternut squash soup. Perfect flavor and texture. 

The beef hamburger and fries are amazing. I like the quality of the beef and the texture of the bread. 
Also ordered the Japanese bento box. I was expecting it to come out in a box not on a plate. Basically it's a poke. It's a bit too spicy to my taste so it's hard to tell the freshness of the fish. I would choose nigiri sushi next time. Wish it cones with miso soup and small appetizer as it stated on the online menu. 

Service is great but a bit slow for the lunch to come to the table. Had to remind the server to check on our orders after a very long wait. 

The hot bread is also very delicious! 

Will definitely return to try more items on the menu. 

Suggestion - could provide tasting menu."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in downtown CLE.  The food and service is always on point, and they are very accommodating. I have to commend the staff because I have showed up here for business meetings and after the indians opening day with a bunch of my hooligan friends & the service level is impeccable. The seafood here rivals Pier W while the steaks can play ball with CLE's best (reds, mortons, hyde, etc)"}
{"text":"The food here is good but the service is less than optimal. Arrived for my 9pm reservation at 9:04 and was promptly seated. We ordered drinks and they came to the table fairly quickly but we placed our food order at 9:56 and didn't get served the food until 11:16. Thank goodness I wasn't that hungry"}
{"text":"Not just a beautiful building but delicious food. The best sushi we have had in a long time! The steak was mouth watering. Plus, when you have a lychee martini on the menu I am automatically a fan!"}
{"text":"This is an impressive establishment in downtown Cleveland. On a cold December night this place was happening on Saturday. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing but the drinks were sub par."}
{"text":"To celebrate our first anniversary, we wanted a special dinner so we went to the Marbleroom. The location is beautiful. The decor and layout is really nice. The food was good, not great for the price. The service is terrible. 

Ive been to a lot of great steakhouses. Berns in Tampa, Craft Steak, Peter Lugars or Red's in Cleveland. What all of those restaurants have that Marbleroom does not is  great service. If you're going to charge prices higher than Lugars, you better have the service to back it up. They're trying to be a high end restaurant but they don't train their servers. I've had better service at Denny's. 

Food: The shrimp cocktail was gigantic but fishy (not so fresh). Salad course was fine, nothing special.  40oz porterhouse was good. Potato au gratin side was missing salt and basic seasoning. The steak was cooked slightly under our preferred temperature but it was also 40oz so no problem. 

Service was TERRIBLE. We got a waiter who did not know how to answer any questions about the menu, types of steak or wine list. It was their first day and it showed. The training program clearly doesn't exist. For a bill exceeding $300 for 2 people, I expect stellar service with someone knowledgeable on how things are cooked and finished... not someone who came from a sports bar who periodically checks back wreaking of cigarettes. The guys delivering the food were cranky. Service was so off-putting that I'm not sure I'd ever go back. 

Also, how about stepping up service and having them slice the 40oz steak tableside? Or a small desert with a congratulations? Red's at least gives great donuts for birthdays/anniversaries.  Totally ruined the anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"1. The food potions are perfect for sharing, and that is exactly what we did. Salad went three ways, two sides went around the table of four and still had enough Mac and cheese to take home.

2. The Mac and cheese was amazing. The 6 oz filet was the perfect size.

3. We were not expecting live music but the saxophone and violin were perfect. Seriously so talented and make the night better.

4. Our waiter was phenomenal. Very friendly. We opted for no dessert because we had birthday cake at home, but he still brought out a tart with \"happy birthday\" written on the plate for my friend.

Overall, glad I picked this restaurant for my friends birthday. Maybe I'll be back one day."}
{"text":"Got here today for our office holiday luncheon and was so looking forward to it after reading all the hype. 

While reviews had me a little concerned about the service I came with an open mind. 

We were pleasantly greeted from the hostess and immediately seated (yes, we did have a reservation). We had nothing but top notch service and Joey our waiter made it a truly enjoyable lunch for all of us. 

The food was excellent and loved that Joey guided us on what to order. My fried rice with king crab was perfectly seasoned and the chunks of crab were delectable. 

My reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is cocktails. For a restaurant of this caliber I think they need to employ a professional mixologist. An old fashioned served with ice cubes rather than one large ice cube and Irish coffee served with clotted cream on the side is unforgivable.

I will definitely return as the food and ambience are top notch, not to mention the service we got from Joey. I am keeping my fingers crossed that cocktails will improve by next visit."}
{"text":"I must say, last night my wife and I had one of the best, most fun and exemplary dining experiences of our adult lives last night at the Marble Room.

From the moment you walk in you are hit by a gorgeous, grand marble expanse of a building that is reminiscent of Howard Hughes/JD Rockefeller and the roaring 20's. We didn't have a rezo, so we put our name down and sat at the bar. 

After two amazing martinis and old fashions, and a round of oysters to boot... we were seated. However, by this point we had made great friends at the bar... we're here from LA visiting family in Cleveland. dave and Ed and Suzanne are our new CLE friends.

We sat... we ordered... Allison our server took expert care of us. We had the Caesar, which was effing perfect... it blew doors off the Palm Caesar and many others which are overdressed. Also love the bowls they're served in. Wife and I split a bone in ribeye w truffle butter... HOLY F-CK. It was the best steak I've had... ever. In my life. 

We also had the Brussel sprouts and a baked potato side that were epic. The bill came, and our NEW FRIENDS AT THE BAR PAID FOR US!!!! Holy shit. What a night. Even if they hadn't I would've been happy to pay for such a grand, delish and memorable dining experience. THE MARBLE ROOM is going to be an annual go-to when in Cleveland for family Xmas!!!!!"}
