{"text":"The food was so fresh. We ordered the polish sampler stuffed cabbage with a big meatball. kielbasa, 4 potato and cheese pierogi and choice of braised cabbage or mashed potatoes

Have to go back next time for dessert Honey cake, Napoleon cake ."}
{"text":"Great food!! Very friendly staff and an inviting atmosphere. I have been waiting for a good pierogi restaurant to open up."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and the food was simply fantastic.  Major comfort food from the Polish plate to the Russian meatballs.  The pickle appetizer was a nice balance to the rich plates and the pickled tomatoes were very unique.  The staff/owners were really nice and took plenty of time to welcome newcomers (not just us but everyone who came in after us).  We had the cake of the day - a fresh made Napoleon - to finish it off. Clearly someone's babushka was in back cooking!  I would love to see them decorate more heavily and make the space more warm and inviting particularly to emphasize the Russian/Eastern European atmosphere to match the quality of the food.  Keep up the great cooking, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not much 'ambience' (it's in a small strip-mall space).  BUT the food is quite tasty and a good value."}
{"text":"Food and service was great! Highly recommend the Solyanka soup. We had the pierogi platter and smoked kielbasa. Both were really good. Looking forward to coming back with friends and trying the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Nicely done Eastern European cuisine!
Cold beet soup was fantastic, great for hot summer days. Russian meatballs with buckwheat were just like my grandmother used to make.
Definitely will be back to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"First off this my first Yelp review ever and I have used Yelp for years and thought this place needed a review.

I just want to say this place is amazing!  Besides frozen pierogis and grocery store kielbasa I have never had homemade Russian food.  I got the zucchini caviar appetizer which was nice and garlicky and fresh for a warm day.  The chicken samosa was also great with a nice pastry crust.  And the pieroshki was fantastic.  It was the potato mushroom filling with a super soft and incredible dough shell.  Can't beat daily fresh backed dough.  As for the entree I got the polish platter and good grief, this was the best meal I have had in a long time!  It was down right comfort food at its best.  Great smoky kielbasa with tender homemade pierogis.  I opted for the braised cabbage instead of mashed potatoes and I am so glad I did.  Just an umami blast of flavor for the taste buds.  Then the stuffed cabbage hit the soul with tasty meat and soft cabbage.  Just can't say enough about this meal.

Super nice employees that I got the vibe they love what they are doing and you can taste the passion.  They also have homemade pierogis and pelmeni (like Russian tortellini) in the freezer for sale by the pound.  No more store bought for me!

A MUST try!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this weekend. Our take out order: Polish Platter, Russian Meatballs with Pierogi and Beef Goulosh were outstanding. Not only was the food great but they have frozen pierogi, kielbasa and mustards available for sale. I plan on picking some up for the holidays!"}
{"text":"First time here and I'll be back. Visited with a Russian friend and they approve!..Homemade deliciousness
We had a sample plate with 3 types of dishes and it was awesome...don't know the name though. 
Pastries come with coffee or black tea which is a plus!"}
{"text":"Stuffed cabbage was tasty and the owner was cute and friendly.  Prices were good, but selection was limited.  They need to offer a sampler plate allowing many choices of dishes to try.  Pierogis were frozen and not homemade."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after searching for a place to eat in the area.  I haven't had a true Polish/Russian deli or restaurant in years. The mushroom and potato pieroshki and pieorgi sampler were both great, and the prices weren't bad at all.  They were very nice in there.  The problem was, everything looked and sounded good.  I wish I could have tried more. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"One word... awesome.  Being a Pittsburgh native my ship has finally arrived.  Pierogi is great but the accompanying thick sliced onions are extraordinary."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic new spot in the Charlotte area! I've been wanting to get borscht for a while and this place serves it on some days. So far I've had a few things off of their menu aside from the borscht (which was exceptional): the pelmeni, the shanezki, and the pieroshki. All fantastic. The service has been great all times that I've been, although I admit it's probably off the lunch rush. The dining area is simple and unpretentious, which is great. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum! I ordered the pierogi sampler and I ate them so fast, I never got a good picture! They were perfectly prepared, perfectly balanced flavors and I can't stop thinking about wanting more! The sweet, saut√©ed onions on top and the sour cream dipping sauce too! Ahh! I think the whole experience was pleasant, the Two ladies who helped me order were welcoming, patient and kind. They promptly prepared my to-go order and the price tag of $9 for a handmade, delicious meal was all I need to give them the 5 stars they deserve!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall place to try out! We were the only people in the restaurant and it was so fun try so many things on the menu. I don't remember specifically what we got as we ordered several things to split and we also ordered dessert. Try anything and everything here because it was all delicious! Try it if you haven't already"}
{"text":"If you are craving something a bit different and comforting at the same time - this is the place. We have visited multiple times both by ourselves and with others.  Always a great experience. High quality food, nice service and clean. The dining area is a bit spartan but acceptable. 

We suggest the Polish Plate to get a great sample of what is possible here. The Borsch is top notch as an appetizer cup or a bowl for a meal. 

The deserts are very good. The Honey cake  is fantastic. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a restaurant that makes cabbage rolls since I moved here over 20 years ago.  I think I finally found that place. No-frills, no pretension, they just make good old-fashioned food, the old-fashioned way. Hot damn!"}
{"text":"Authentic home-made food. Amazingly delicious Pierogis and a generous portion of Polish Plater. Baked goods were on point, and the soup was full of flavors. The restaurant is clean, service is fast, and there is a small section of Russian goodies for sale - convenient! Definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I'm from CT and the city where I lived was mostly Polish.  My grandma was 100% Polish and I  can say this place makes me miss her and her cooking.  I got the Polish platter and it was so good!  Not one complaint.  I will def. Eat here again!"}
{"text":"Place was empty at 1 pm when I walked in . Their honey cake I bought to go is very delicious. I was disappointed to learn that they will not honor me 10 percent off coupon yelp rewards you on first check in."}
{"text":"I recently stated that I was really in the mood for some good Pierogies and boom......Babushka's Pierogi came through. Went for lunch and arrived soon after the resturant had opened.  I ordered the polish platter which comes with pierogies, stuffed cabbage, kielbasa and braised cabbage. The pierogies were my favorite. Very flavorful and not too doughy. Cabbage was well seasoned and kielbasa was flavorful. Being of Eastern European decent I grew up eating my mother's stuffed cabbage and hers will always be number one in my book.  I took a slice of the walnut cake home. I thought it was layers of crepes and filling. Not the case. It actually was more like a honey crumb cake. The more I ate it, the more I enjoyed it. 
I briefly spoke with the owner and she was lovely. I would recommend this resturant to anyone. My only request would be I'd like my food a little hotter."}
{"text":"Phenomenal Russian food to please your taste buds and keep you happy to eat here again! I am so thankful I checked yelp today. This casual restaurant is full of homemade Russian food. The dinner I tried tonight was the chicken pelmeni--think of the texture of dumplings but the size of tortellini. The savory meat and soft dough made me so happy along with the butter and chive sauce. I also ordered the solyanka soup--which was incredible!! Soup included ham, sausage, potatoes, olives, lemon and dill seasoning in a clear broth. Truly awesome! They only make this soup on Saturday/Sunday.   The honeycake for dessert was magical as it had at least 10 layers of walnut-based pastry with buttercream layers and a buttery flavor. Imagine a giant buttercream cake with walnuts, sort of reminded me of baklava. Yum! All
Desserts are homemade!

Service was excellent and Yuliya, my server and one of the owners, was delightful in helping me select a very tasty dinner.  Thanks for my first introduction to Russian food! I'm a fan. 
You know when you hear Russian being spoken as you walk inside the restaurant, that Babuska's is legitimately wonderful Russian food.  The simple decor of wooden panels and wooden spoons is very pleasing.  The soup menu changes every day, they also have plenty of vegetarian dishes also.  Prices are reasonable as my dinner was $12+change. 

(Their location is off 51, on the way to the Carolina Place mall, in the same tower place shopping square as Thai House.)"}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic Russian food in Pineville. The chicken pelmeni with a sauce choice, the tomato sauce has a undefined taste new to me, but good. Potato and cheese pierogi with sauce choice,  sour cream obvious choice. Borscht soup is spiced perfectly with silvers of carrots and beef, amazing taste. Cabbage roll with a light sauce and tender cabbage served with creamy whipped potatoes and a side.  Save room for honey cake with a creamy sweet cheese icing and at least 12 thin little layers of scrumptious cake.  This place is awesome"}
{"text":"This place was great! I hope more people give it a try! I came here for lunch with my gf and the lady was very nice. My gf is a vegetarian and had plenty of options. I got the polish platter and that cabbage roll was crazyyyyy good. Sausage too. I also got the borsh or however you spell it. Was delicious I gotta come back it's been too long."}
{"text":"My family is sitting in Babushka's now. We shared an order of the Russian meatballs, the polish platter, and the pierogi sampler plate. Everything is fantastic. Fresh and flavorful. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Been to this place three times now.    Everything that I have tried has been great.   Nice space and friendly service."}
{"text":"Pierogi was tender and tasteful casual dinning area nice selection of both polish and Russian food."}
{"text":"These pierogies are really really good. I had the potato and cheese pierogies and I highly recommend them the service was great and they were very nice"}
{"text":"Very clean. Nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. Food was good and a unique experience. They also sell and assortment of Russian teas, jams and jellies, snacks, frozen foods, meats and cheese. There are pictures of a variety of food you can order and they are very informative of what the food is like in case you are not sure if you will like it. We ordered the Polish Sampler (tasty sausage, stuffed cabbage and soft cheese filled savory dumplings) and the beef stew (comes with two slices of bread and a side). We also got the Napoleon cake, also tasty and cool which came with good Russian coffee. Would come again for a quick snack or even lunch to go. Dine in is good too. We ordered at the front then sat ourselves. Food was brought out to us in a quick and timely manner. Don't want to see this place go since it is the only Russian restaurant of its kind in the area. Will support."}
{"text":"This place has wonderful food and service! We had the pierogi sampler and the kielbasa. The food is authentic and reminded me of the pierogis and kielbasa my Polish grandmother used to make! We are looking forward to going back and trying their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times.  Try different combinations.  Very consistent.  Pierogis. Sausage. Meat cabbage rolls.  Russian slaw.  Soft drinks from dispenser.  
Clean.  Quiet.
Just something different.
Only down side is closed Mondays, Thursdays, and Sundays."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious. Just like my Russian mother used to make. Pierogis and cabbage rolls were excellent. Place is clean and service is gracious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our first dinner at Babushka's.   Had the Polish platter with the braised cabbage which was awesome.  Enjoyed the Russian meatballs and the pierogi.  Kids loved the Chicken pelmini.   The Olivier salad was a big hit with the family as well.   Napoleon cake for dessert!!!   Please support this great local restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great Russian Food! They even heat the bread they serve with soup. Not exactly vegetarian friendly, but one good vegan/veggie meal are the mushroom pierogis."}
{"text":"Delicious food! This is the first time to try Russian food. I had the Russian meatballs and Pierogi and it was great!"}
{"text":"Well, my 98 year old dad and I have really worked this place.  Been there 5 times with dad and once with wife.  We are all in agreement that we are fans and that it is more than just a food ordering place. 

The people working here are amazingly friendly and helpful.  As they are serving foods that many Americans are not familiar with, they have photos of the plates, answer your questions and provide advise on what will go with what  and if you have ordered too much.  Yes, it is easy to find yourself with lots of plates \"to try\" and have enough food to feed more that are at your table.

Babushka's is owned and operated by a Russian family.  Their story is representative of how foreigners can come to this country and with hard work and risk taking can open and run a successful business.  Although everyone we have been in contact with speaks English very well, this is a very fine opportunity to practice your Russian.

I have discovered their Russian meatballs, which are absolutely outstanding.  Such nice flavor and the gravy I would drink from a cup or bowl.  Comes with mashed potatoes or potato pirogis and I recommend the pirogis as a perfect fit.  Amazing.  When I gushed about how wonderful the meatballs were to the cashier she commented that it was a favorite of customers.  

Finally tried their cabbage soup, which was excellent, also. Going beyond the boiled cabbage found in southern cafeterias, this soup was a darker base, had potato and bits of carrot and a dollop of thick sour cream plopped into the center. Very yummy and a meal in itself if you ordered a bowl.  Bread is extra and, frankly, you do not need it.  

Dad, a half Polish, half Ukranian boy who grew up in the mill town of Utica, NY, as expected, slowly devoured a ten-piece plate of pirogis and left, saying, as he has every time we have been at Babushka's, \"This is the best lunch I have ever had.\"

{"text":"First time here and it did not disappoint! In fact, it exceeded my expectations! The people working here are very friendly and the food is delicious. It's very casual- you order at the counter and they bring you your food. I had the russian meatballs and pierogi platter with the cabbage! OH! It was so delicious and comforting!! Definitely stop here if you are around!  **update. Babushka's is closing March 31,2018 for good! I am so sad!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place.  Sweet and friendly staff and owners.  They will teach you about the foods you haven't heard of and serve you wonderfully tasty items you have heard of.  They should be able to charge for the delicious smells that envelop you as you enter.  Don't forget to try a soup with your entree.  They are amazing!!  Very fair and reasonable pricing!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a restaurant for a double date night. I came across Babushka's Piergoi and was immediately reminded of my mom's polish cooking. The reviews and photos were impressive, so we all decided to give it a try. The restaurant was located in a plaza, so parking was relatively easy. We were a bit taken back when no customers were in the restaurant, but as soon as we placed our orders and sat down, people came flooding in. Between the four of us, we tried the meatballs, polish sausage, cabbage roll, pierogis, mashed potatoes, gravy, and sauerkraut. All were delicious and tasted like home-cooked polish food. Only complaint was too much butter and mustard on the sandwich."}
{"text":"It took me a while to get here, but like most of my fellow Yelpers, I really enjoyed the food at this inauspicious little Russian joint, tucked away amid the many storefronts making up Tower Place Shopping Center in Pineville. It has become part of a suddeningly diverse international food scene, including Thai, Indian, Columbian, Russian/Polish, Vietnamese, NY Bagles and, of course, everyone's favorite (except mine) K&W cafeteria. May the choices continue to expand!

Now about Babushkas itself... It serves up a wonderful variety of Eastern European fare. At the advice of many of the other reviews, I decided to go with the Polish Platter at $13 comprised of a Polish sausage, stuffed cabbage, four pierogies and braised cabbage (or mashed potatoes) as a side. Everything was savory and delicious; however, as some have reported, a couple of my items were served surprisingly lukewarm.

My wife chose the Russian Meatballs & Pierogie Platter. We both agreed that the meatballs were our favorite, while again the pierogies were lukewarm.

The tea was served beside the fountain drinks and was very watery and somewhat tasteless. Since you order at the counter and have your meal delivered to you, service was minimal and somewhat muted, yet friendly. Dining area is very comfortable and roomy, and most importantly, clean! Overall sanitary rating was a 96.5. We were interested in dessert but the samples of the counter appeared very dry. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Excellent Eastern European but needs to be served hot and not lukewarm

Had a couple of potential restaurants I wanted to try which are new to the restaurant scene. One is the new Famous Toastery that  opened last Wednesday in Huntersville and the other was Babushka's Pierogi near Carolina Place Mall.

After Church was out at 10:30 am, we tried Famous Toastery and it was almost an hour wait. Time to execute Plan B and go to Bubushka's. May sound like a hike but it was only 25 minutes as opposed to an hour and I'm glad we did. Besides, my wife had an exchange she needed to make at Dillard's and that only a little over a mile away.

They open at 11:00 am and we showed up about 11:20 am and were the first patrons in the store.

Simple but elegant layout with an attractive treatment with wood.  You go to the front counter and place your order from off of the overhead menu board. If you have any questions, the staff is more than glad to answer and questions.

My wife is from Pittsburgh which has a very strong Eastern European presence and a Strong Culinary Tradition said Cuisine. I like the Cuisine as well and enjoy it every time I get a chance.

Both of us ordered the Polish Platter which is Kielbasa, 4 potato and cheese Pierogi's, Stuffed Cabbage Roll and Braised Cabbage. My wife wanted Iced Tea which they don't have so she went with water instead. They do have Hot Tea which I love and it was a fragrant Russian type which I have not have in years. It was great.

We waited about 15 minutes and our meal was brought out to our table.  Everything was great with the exception that every thing was luke warm at best. Would have been so much better if it had enough energy to melt to butter or make the sour cream flow.  Only reason I did not give them a higher rating was the temperature of the food.

We talked to another patron also with Pittsburgh ties and she loved the food as well but had the same comments about the serving temperature.

Good flavorful food. Tucked away in the back of small shopping district but they will do well.

Get the temperature of the food up, I would recomment to anyone."}
{"text":"Fantastic homemade perogi, and my family is from Poland and hand makes their own, so we're sure of our assessment. I've also had the cabbage soup and it's perfect for a cold day."}
{"text":"Authentic. Friendly. Delicious. I am a huge (huge) pierogi fan, and I am thrilled to have found this place! I prefer fried pierogis, but here that is not an option...and they are still delicious. They have also started selling them homemade by the pound so you can pan fry them at home! I have never had a cabbage roll before- and that was the surprise star of the show. Filled with a perfectly seasoned pork and beef mixture, I could have eaten three of them. The only teeny tiny complaint I even have was the borscht wasn't as flavorful as I was expecting, but that's just personal preference. This type of food has to be cooked perfectly imo- since you aren't working with a huge variety of spices/ingredients...and Babushka's pulled it off. Very fresh and delicious food. Definitely worth the (almost) 30 minute drive for me. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Many thanks to the owners of Babushka's Pierogi for such incredible, authentic food and friendly service!  I love the pieroshkis; they are so fluffy and flavourful with a nice golden brown finish! The borsch, solyanka, and cabbage soup are also my favourites!! Don't miss any opportunity to have this experience of great food and friendly, welcoming faces at Babushka's Pierogi!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended.  I'm 100% Ukrainian, and this place did not disappoint.  I'll be back to try more of the menu"}
{"text":"This was excellent!  I highly recommend checking it out.  Nothing fancy, but great food and the service was as friendly as it gets."}
{"text":"First time trying them out. Very happy I did! Food was very good. The only thing I would have liked better if the food was hotter. Kind of lukewarm  but other than that taste! Very friendly staff and clean restaurant and restrooms. I tried the Polish platter to get a little of everything. Tried the Napoleon cake. It wasn't what I expected. No cake,just layers of puff pastry and cream. Tasted ok,but I'll try something else next time.  Will be back for some soup next visit."}
{"text":"Small place with a variety of pierogies. The meatballs and mashed potatoes were delicious as well. I have an ethnic family background, so I'm pretty particular about this kind of food. The stuffed cabbage was okay, but a little boring. Can't beat those fresh foods, though."}
{"text":"There are very few Russian/Polish places in Charlotte. We really enjoyed the kielbasa, pierogis and blintzes. They have a selection of Russian groceries as well if you want to eat at home. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good! This spot is tucked away in a shopping center, a small space with a handful of tables and not a lot of decor. But don't let looks deceive you- this is some of the most authentic, delicious Russian food you could ever dream of having in Charlotte, NC! I was born in Russia. I grew up eating pieroshki from my Baba, celebrating birthdays with honey cake, sneaking pickled veggies from the fridge in between meals... Eating here brought the memories rushing back. The food really is like my Baba used to make, fresh and cooked with love and legacy. Go here!! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I've driven here from Raleigh twice because it's that damn good, and each time I've eaten until I've been stuffed and then ordered nearly one of everything to go to bring home with me. The pierogi are amazing, the solyanka was like a trip back to my childhood with my grandmother making it, and the stuffed cabbage was a delight. I can't find any fault in the food, though I'm sad that they've taken the blini off the menu.

Every time I'm headed through Charlotte I will be making a stop here. :D"}
{"text":"Very good food. Delicious pierogis. Outstanding samsa (European empanada like pie). The turtle cake was yummy - not too sweet but tasty. Overall very good experience. I will be returning often. The meat cabbage roll was good and the sauce that came on it was delicious. If I could have licked the plate I would have!!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting for this wonderful place to open up. The recipes are old time Russian favorites and will please people who are new to Russian food as well as people who are already familiar with the assortment of breads, potatoes, beets, cabbage, onions and spices.

I have a few Russian friends who I expect to see here on a regular basis.

South Charlotte has the best Russian food now!"}
{"text":"Our first time trying this lovely establishment. Food was made fresh after we ordered and it was all delicious. I recommend the pierogi sampler for those of you unfamiliar with the dish. Very polite and charming service. The food was prepared and brought to our table very quickly. We will be back with friends in tow."}
{"text":"Best Pierogis I've ever had. The honey cake was to die for also. Owner and staff were very sweet.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten a good share of homemade eastern european food and this place is amazing. Extremely affordable, homemade and delicious. Book marking this place and def coming back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the polish plate and enjoyed the kielbasa, but found the cabbage roll, the pieroges, and the braised cabbage to be very bland. I had really hoped the pierogies would be more tender than they were. Not horrible but certainly didn't add up to the previous Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"All good things to say about this place!

Plenty of parking. Tremendously friendly and genuine staff. Very accommodating too! I am a vegetarian and they voluntarily made the olivier salad for me without meat. Menu prices fair! 

Clean tables and floors. Great woodwork on the walls and lots of natural light and cheery fixture lighting. Restrooms are gender specific one at a time style. Very clean and roomy!

Menu is not isolating at all. You will find the ingredients very familiar. Like I said, I'm a vegetarian and I did not have a problem finding things without meat. I had the 9 pierogi sampler: potato/cheese, potato/mushroom, mushroom/cabbage. They were absolutely outstanding. My mother and grandmother used to make pierogis (varenyky) all the time so I can definitely tell when they are scratch made and these were definitely scratch made. So flavorful and tender and topped with sauteed onions. Absolutely excellent! Decent sized too so your stomach doesn't feel overwhelmed afterwards. As mentioned earlier, also had a bowl of olivier salad which is basically a Russian potato salad with potatoes, eggs, peas, pickles and onions in a sour cream/mayonnaise sauce. There's usually beef, chicken, or bologna in it. Another absolute winner of a dish! 

Took home a slice of honey cake and it was HUGE! Honey cake is a tender multi-layer cake with a sour cream or creme fraische filling. Very light and bursting with flavor. Tasted a lot like the cereal Golden Grahams which is a very good thing. 

Da! I will be back!"}
{"text":"As soon as it was brought to the table, the foods delicious smells brought instant memories of my grandfather and the foods he ate.  He shared with us kids his love for the foods his family prepared.  I brought my daughter and my sister-in-law and her 5 year old son and they all loved it!  We ordered the pieroghi sampler, the meatballs with mash potatoes and apple pieroshki.   All were excellent, it was not enough. We will be back to try some more!!!   I am a little biased as it brings back happy families but my daughter and the rest didn't have those memories and they were equally loving the food.  Transport your taste buds to eastern europe!  You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Just okay. 
Not bad. Not great.

I know everyone cooks in the style they know and love but I do prefer another place, out of state, that has flavor and even a bit of spice. 
This is real deal traditional Eastern European kind of middle of the road bland. I don't mean that in a bad way just explaining they lack seasoning for the purpose of flavoring. 

All the ladies are super sweet. They were sincerely shocked and inquisitive about my knowledge of the dishes/areas plus they were direct enough to ask, WHICH I RESPECT but fell over when I explained my Estonian connection. 

If you don't have anything else, get the mashed potatoes and the gravy has a flavor plus lots of onions as requested were provided. I'd totally swing by to purchase some pelmeni and hook it up at home. 

They offer a YELP discount. 
I'd recommend for the service and the locally owned - home cooking style is in effect. 

P.S. I underestimated the Eastern European-immigrant/migrant/American population around these parts. All the suburbs prove they've got a real presence and I'm glad to find the bakeries and pirogi, pelmeni and all the sour cream I can handle without a  side eye.  Oh! and dark or rye bread :)

P.P.S. pierogi can be spelled pirogi Yelp spelling gods :P"}
{"text":"I was excited about trying this place and disappointed when I did. I had the polish platter. The pierogi was good, the stuffed cabbage filling was tasteless and the cabbage was tough and chewy. The kielbasa was just ok and a bit dry and the braised cabbage was also pretty tasteless. May give it one more try at something else on the menu, but I don't think so."}
{"text":"Wow!  Pierogi sampler, 4 meatballs, a Samsa, cabbage roll and a slice of turkey cake to share.  As someone who lived and enjoyed the Polish and Russian restaurants in Chicago, THANK GOD this place exists in Charlotte.  Serious yum!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try this place after I found it here in the strip mall next to my hotel. They have weird hours so had to wait to Wednesday lunch to try it. Walked in and it was quite a sterile environment. Nothing in the deli cases but a lot of pictures of the food on the walls. kinda like from a magazine not actual pictures. Ordered the Russian platter. It was a cabbage roll, potato cheese Pierogi, w fried onions and a polish sausage. Choice of braised cabbage or mashed potatoes. I chose mashed. My fave! I decided just from the looks of the place to take my lunch to go. When I opened the box it looked and smelled delicious. Homemade creamy mashed and a light tomato gravy covered them as well as the cabbage roll. Smoky and salty sausage and Pierogi all piping hot. However only negative was the cabbage roll exterior was so tough I couldn't cut it w the cheap
Plastic fork they gave me. The meat filling was tasty but meat was very tough. I was overall pleased. Would prob try meatballs next time and or stick to Pierogies."}
{"text":"We visited this special place 2 days ago.   It is not pretentious - just good hearty basic food from Eastern Europe - Polish, Hungary, Russia, etc

Food was excellent and the service attentive.  A selection of frozen foods, pastries and beverages are available to take home."}
{"text":"Soup was amazing!! We had their Saturday soup of the day! I'd definitely go back for that! My dad purchased some smoked and Polish kielbasa to take home. Can't wait to try it! The ladies there were so sweet!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic European meal, Babushka's is THE place! Several great options greet you on the chalkboard, including different specials each day of the week, If you struggle with deciding what to get they are nice enough to provide you with photographic assistance of their meal options. That definitely helped me out! The friendly down to earth staff is more than willing to answer any questions.

Everyone in my group was pleased with their choices for lunch, and that tells you a lot about a place. With the small staff the food does take a bit of time to come out, but it is worth it. I've seen great reviews on all of their deserts but they did not have a specific one that I saw pictured, That was a bummer, hopefully next time I will be able to try it!

They also have a small marketplace in the shop if you're in the need for some European grocery items."}
{"text":"It isn't often that we are down near Carolina Place, so since we were in the area, it was time to check out a new(ish) place on the scene: Babushka's. Perhaps Charlotte will become the new Pierogi/Eastern European hot spot, what with Euro Grill, Taste of Europe and all. Who knows - stranger things have probably happened.

The inside is not fancy, but is definitely serviceable - a counter where you order, a chalk/menu board, and several tables around once you get the food. Even some coolers where you can take home some pierogi if you like, though oddly, the ones in the cooler do not appear to be the same as they serve. This is good and bad - they do not seem to be serving frozen/pre-made pierogi (good), and they do not appear to be packing them up for you to take home and make when you get that craving (bad). Also, there are a bunch of other flavors in the coolers that you cannot get at the counter (more bad).

Regardless, the counter serves more than just pierogi, so in that respect, go in expecting more of a general eastern europe theme, where you can get cabbage rolls or soup of the day (or just go for the pierogi, since it's in the name, you know). You can get a plate of just the potato-filled bundles of joy or you can get them served up with a sausage, depending on your mood (or preference). Either way, definitely worth a visit if you like the pierogi, or if you think you might. Just don't go in expecting anything fancy."}
{"text":"Babushka's is delicious! I didn't know I'd come on their 4th day of business but turns out they just opened on Saturday 11/12. The restaurant is tucked in a strip mall; it's small and clean, perfect for lunch or a meal to go. I ordered the chicken pelmeni w/sour cream; it took a good 20 minutes to get my plate. The woman taking orders was very nice and apologetic about it taking so long. In their defense, I came in right after a group of 5 who each ordered pelmeni, too. They tasted exactly how I hoped they would. They come out hot and freshly boiled with a side of sour cream. Can't beat a hot, filling meal for $8 and change. I'll be back next time I'm nearby."}
{"text":"If you like pierogis and goulash and borsch you might want to check this place out. They sell frozen pierogis also. Don't expect much variety but what they have is good. I enjoyed my visit. Try it out, it's good."}
{"text":"I am absolutely obsessed with this place. In fact, my obsession began before I ever even walked into the restaurant when I started seeing Instagram posts. OBSESSED. This reminds me of an amazing meal from a grandmother. Well, that is, if your grandma is Russian.

It's in the middle of a shopping center, nothing fancy at all. You order at the counter. I love that they have pictures up of all the food. Makes it a lot easier to order. I usually get the Polish Platter (stuffed cabbage, kielbasa, braised cabbage, and potato and cheese pierogis). It's all amazing. I'm a huge fan of the braised cabbage. I always get it instead of mashed potatoes. My roommate loves the Polish sandwich, he usually gets that and a pierogi sampler. Our most recent visit, some friends ordered the meatball platter, Solyanka soup, pieroshkis, and Blintzes (crepes). Everything was delicious. 

They have a case in the store where you can buy frozen pierogi and pelmini varieties. Babushka's also has a catering menu. Free hot coffee or tea with the purchase of a dessert."}
{"text":"Soooooo good. They're working out the kinks in terms of timing things, but honestly, that's totally fine by me - it's worth the wait. The Palmenis are delicious and my 6-year old devours them in no time (that's saying something). The soups fresh and the girls that serve you are always accommodating. It's not much of an interior atmosphere, but again, we didn't mind a bit..... I wish I could have an endless supply of these little pockets of deliciousness. (I haven't tried the take home bags, but there's nothing better than fresh palmenis with fresh sour cream!!! YUM! I will seriously cry if this place goes away any time in the near future....."}
{"text":"As someone of Russian descent, I had to try this place when I came across it on yelp. While a few of their items are Americanized, overall they've got a great traditional vibe to their foods. The Uzbek pilaf was especially delicious and the desert napoleon cake comes with hot tea automatically which is the perfect finish to a quaint meal. The place itself is more low-key; an order at the cash register, sit down with a number kind of place, but the food is high quality!"}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh food. I had the Polish platter. I also added a cup of borsch and honey cake for dessert. I cant wait to go back and try everything!"}
{"text":"We were welcomed as soon as we walked in. The menu was patiently explained to us and we placed our order. Our food was brought out to us quickly. We had the cabbage roll dinner and pierogi with kielbasa. We enjoyed everything. It was nice to experience Russian food from a family that was so wanting to share their family recipes with us."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little place.  Since we were new to Russian food, the very sweet hostess gave us a quick intro to the food.  I got the stuffed cabbage.  Very tasty and full of delicious meat.   Kielbasa was great too. 

They have a few Russian items to buy like frozen pirogies or Russian drinks. 

A fun place to go!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is great. The people are friendly and welcoming. I had the meat dumplings with butter and a side of sour cream. I couldn't decide which way to order them and so the woman taking my order offered both! 

The flavors were amazing and I liked the butter best because it gave the food an opportunity to shine. 

I'm anxious to go back for borscht. Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"It's small and humble but the flavor of the food delivers. Everything we had (solyanka, pelmini, pierogi and honey cake) was simply delicious. The guy at the register was very helpful. We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"For a different and delicious flavor change of pace, this place is a great choice!  Seriously great pierogies on the menu. It don't pass up on the Samsa and the blitzes!"}
{"text":"We bought a bunch of dishes and ate family style. It was fantastic food and very friendly owners/waitstaff.  Of course we had to top it all off with some of the homemade cakes.  I highly recommend"}
{"text":"I've never had food like this before. It was amazing!!! Got the polish platter. It was enough to split for lunch. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Oh my pierogi... I have been searching for a place to get pierogis for forever ever since the taste of Europe in Matthews closed down. Then I did some searching and found out that this place has been right infront of my face THE WHOLE TIME!! Came here with my sister because we enjoy pierogis and much to our surprise they did not disappoint. I've seen people complain that they don't come out hot. But why would you want them hot and have to wait to eat them?! They come out just right at a nice warm temperature and they retain their heat very well. I can't wait to come back because they were delicious!"}
{"text":"Our first time here - we will definitely come back. My kids are adopted from Russia & Ukraine - they wanted to eat traditional foods from their countries. My daughter tried the Russian meatballs with potato/cheese pierogi . She is a very picky eater but she loved it. She especially liked the little pickles on the side. My son tried the pierogi sampler. He liked the cheese & potato one , he said the cabbage were ok with sour cream & he gave me the mushroom ones. I loved the mushroom! I tried the Stolynaka soup( spelling?) unusual with olives & lemon slice but very tasty. Also tried the apple piroshki- very good too. The counter staff was very helpful . We weren't sure what to try , their suggestions were great."}
{"text":"Seriously the best polish and Russian food I've had besides my grandmothers. Please come here for a delicious home cooked Eastern European meal."}
{"text":"If you are craving some good comfort food, look no further. This place is amazing, and their dishes honestly taste like they were made by a loving grandma back in Russia. So far we've tried pelmeni (dumplings), meat cabbage roll with mashed potatoes and a side of pickled veggies, solyanka (soup) and Medovik (honey cake). We loved every single thing. The service is very friendly, and you can tell that people running the place really care about it. 
I couldn't recommend it more, and I'm so happy we finally have a good Russian restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but it is NOT HOT at all. We don't like lukewarm food and that included the soups and main dishes. Staff is very friendly and helpful but you find more information about the menu on line than in the restaurant. Pictures are fine (which is what they show) but the web site goes into detail as to what everything is made with. Lunch was $20 per PERSON for a cup of soup, main dish, and drink.  At these prices I am not sure they have a bright future.  They have only been in business for three months and maybe these are just growing pains. They need to read their reviews and fix a few things."}
{"text":"I don't know how long I've wanted Pierogis. Maybe as long ago as the first Men In Black movie? It's certainly been a while and I've not spotted an Eastern European restaurant since then so when Babushka's popped up on my Facebook feed, it got bookmarked and then visited. It's a small restaurant in one of the many strip plazas along Pineville-Matthews Road near the Charlotte-Pineville border. Buried in the back, I've missed seeing it for a while. So here we are.

Quite a few pictures of the various meals and entries along the counter would help someone who was not familiar with Ukrainian/Russian/Polish foods. Sausages, blitzes, cabbage (stuffed or braised) and of course, pierogies and pelmenis and piroshky. Served with colorful sides and delicious toppings. Yum.

I opted for the \"Russian meatballs\" (I don't know what makes them Russian) and Pierogi, which comes with one side. I chose pickles. It didn't take long and my late lunch was brought to the table. A very big portion and I'm sorry to say, I ate it all.

The meatballs were delicious. Well packed, firm but not tough. Too big to eat in one bit politely, I was good and sliced them in half before stuffing it into my mouth. Flavorful and the sauce was tangy. The pierogi were filled with cheese and or potato. Just about bite size, the grilled onions on top were perfect. Pickles? Crisp and crunchy, as a pickle should be.

The have a few Eastern European delicacies for sale as well. But since I can't read Cyrillic, I'll never know. Something that could have been chocolate, another that looked like a malt beverage. Yum.

Great stuff here indeed."}
{"text":"What a great new edition to the Charlotte food scene! Small and bare bones and affordable but welcoming and authentic, this little spot near Pineville is a great introduction to Russian food or a new staple for those who are already fans. Think comforting soups and stews, hearty rolls with meats and root vegetables, excellent pierogis and pelmini to die for. I really enjoyed the sweet cream pierogis and the simple but delicious carrot salad side. Get there early as they are so popular they sell out, but they made up for it by bringing complimentary pastries to our table. We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you like good homemade European food you should visit Babuskha .  Very yummy desserts  and Hungarian food"}
{"text":"Authentic Russian. Pierogi's were very good. Cabbage meat roll was very tasty. I would love to see them expand their menu with more Russian/Slavic dishes."}
