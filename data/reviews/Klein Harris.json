{"text":"Awonderful experience all around. The service was very good but the food was fantastic. we had the toast with 3 jams and our guests had the ravioli. Both were superb. For mains we had hangar steak , the pork belly and the duck breast. Everything was outstanding. Dessert of donuts and pavlova capped off a great feast. Already making plsns to go back."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the price, more than reasonable.  Nice shareable plates that depict Canadian Cuisine.  The staff is casual and very pleasant. A little gem on Stephen Ave.  A great recommendation from Ben at Le Germain.  You can't go wrong here.  Merci pour une excellente soirée."}
{"text":"High recommend this place for food really! We've ordered the steak with maple and chili. That was fabulously delicious! The oyster there was fresh and juicy. The chicken burger made a wonderful taste trip for us also. It's our first try in Calgary and if there any chances, we'll back here again."}
{"text":"The food was well prepared and tasted great. Surprisingly large portions but I suppose it's better to have too much than not enough. Service could have been more attentive as there was a couple of occasions I had to wait an unreasonable amount of time for the server to come back and offer another drink but it could have been an off-night."}
{"text":"First visit to Klein Harris and overall I enjoyed my time there. The weather was really nice so the patio was full (like everywhere else on the street!) Luckily for my friend and I, we prefer sitting inside anyway, so all was well.

We ordered 1/2 dozen oysters, toast 3 ways, mushroom ravioli, and for dessert we had the pavlova and fresh made doughnuts. (It was National Doughnut Day afterall ;p ) We shared all the dishes which is how most of the menu is designed. But feel free to order for yourself or share anything, they're more than happy to bring extra plates and cutlery as needed!

Everything was light and fresh. The oysters were shucked well and the mignonette added that expected lovely hit of acid (don't over do it with the mignonette unless you want pickled oysters! @.@ No bad trips here people! Hehehe get it? Bad drug joke! XP)

The ravioli was very tasty, it kept with the fresh and light direction. The arugula salad and tomatoes worked surprisingly well in the dish! The sauce at the bottom of the bowl was pretty great, very buttery! Yum!

The toast 3 ways was a bit of a surprise! I expected 3 large pieces of toast each with different toppings, but you actually get toast strips and 3 spreads: brown butter mushrooms (meh, ok but not super good), smoked onion jam (better), and canola oil poached tomatoes (my fave!)
Tip: layer up all 3
Better Tip:
Speaking briefly with the table next to ours, they really loved the diver scallops, so... skip the toast and go for the scallops!

Finally we get to dessert, the best part of that meal! The Pavlova was really amazing, it has that great crisp outside and chewy soft sweet amazing inside! The spiced screech whipped cream however was underwhelming (yes, I do mean that super high proof, white dog type, burning alcohol: screech!) Don't get me wrong, it was totally delicious! It's whipped cream! It just didn't live up to hype of the \"screech\" description.
But seriously, even without the screech, a pile of whipped cream, some fresh fruit, jam and perfect pavlova is happiness in a bowl!

The doughnuts were good, not mind blowing, but still good! They look like beignets, they're light and fluffy on the inside and come with a salted caramel sauce and a chocolate sauce. Probably because they're so light, you could have the whole thing to yourself without hating your life choices afterwards! Plus at $7 for a stack, it's worth a try!

In conclusion:
A lovely restaurant experience, I enjoyed everything I ate (some were obviously more enjoyable to me than others but nothing was bad or even close to bad.) The service was good, attentive but not hovering. The drinks were good but I'd have to sample more before really reviewing them. I would recommend this place to my friends, and I'll be going again for sure.
That famous/infamous screech makes another appearance in the Pork Roast so... gotta give that a go in the future! Cheers & thanks for reading till the end!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends to celebrate a birthday dinner and it did not disappoint. The dishes are fairly priced and portioned well. We shared the mushroom ravioli, smoked duck breast and humboldt squid. All three were excellent and had us licking our plates. We did have to wait a while in between both courses which was a bit disappointing. We originally wanted the pork belly and scallop special only to find out that it was sold out for the night when it came time to order. For mains, we had the lamb, steak and black cod. Both meats were well cooked and the lamb was particularly done well. I quite enjoyed the strong lamb flavors. The black cod could've been more tender and melt in your mouth as it was on the verge of being overcooked. The only downfall to the main dishes were the potatoes in the dish as they were quite bland. More of the sauce on the main dishes would've helped with that. Also, more creative sides pairing could've been nice as every dish had the same potatoes. We found the restaurant to be pretty busy the whole time we were there and I noticed they had coaches in the back by the kitchen in case you wanted to stop by for drinks and nibbles. Very cool. I would not hesitate to return!"}
{"text":"So much love went into making this delicious burger!   Every bite was like heaven sent."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Atmosphere is great. My server was funny and knowledgeable. I have several allergies and everyone knew what was in the food they were serving. Would go again!"}
{"text":"Recently checked K/H out for a birthday and was pretty excited.  First off, the signage in front wasn't easy to spot so had to look closely to find the restaurant.  We were a party of 12 for a birthday and although booked in advance, found out we were slated to sit at 2 separate tables.  After about 15 minutes (and while we waited for the rest of the party), they relented and pushed a few more together.  The service was decent although slow at times (took about 15 minutes for a beer at one point when my friend ordered one a few minutes after I had and received his immediately).  There is no beer on tap, just bottles and they were out of a few selections (albeit think they try to cater more to a cocktail crowd).  I tried their Caesar which is made in house with clam juice and celery broth.  It was decent although still prefer the original.

The food options were varied so there would be something for everyone.  A friend and I split the Foie Gras Tasting (3 ways) and although it was quite tasty and looked great, it wasn't explained to us when is was served so we didn't quite know what we were eating.  It came with 9 crostinis which wasn't enough so we ordered more.  We ended up getting 4 more crostinis only to find out we would be charged $2 for them.

The mains were enjoyed by most (I had the chicken which was tender with a crispy skin).  Friends enjoyed the duck and hangar steak while the coastal feature (offered on Wednesdays) was a small portion.

The deserts were pretty good although they only had 1 bread pudding left (although many of us were wanting to order it).  Good thing that option was out as a bunch of us ended up ordering their donuts instead (these were the star of the night).  The 6 decent sized doughnut balls with chocolate and salted caramel sauces were amazing, I would return just for these.

An added bonus is that they split up everyones bills (not sure if anyone had asked) and there was no automatic gratuity even though it was a bigger party.  

All in all, I would return but think they just have a few kinks to work out given they just opened.  Hopefully it will stick around.  The biggest tip I could give would be to explain the dishes when they are being served up."}
{"text":"This was our first stop during our first trip to Calgary.  Located on the downtown pedestrian mall in Calgary, Klein Miller is a trendy spot surrounded by pubs and chain restaurants.  Surprisingly, the bar was rather small, and the place was empty on a late Friday afternoon. While everything was perfectly nice, it was also perfectly innocuous.  Service was pleasant, but totally preoccupied with getting ready for dinner service. Food was not memorable.  We left Klein Harris feeling nothing, wondering if Calgary had any potential for being a good weekend getaway."}
{"text":"Located in the previous location of Home Tasting Room; nice restaurant with tables for about the first half of the space and a neat lounging area with sofas and other comfortable seating at the back! Booked a reservation here after hearing positive reviews from a couple of friends. There were 4 of us for dinner and the service was great throughout. 

My boyfriend and I shared the mushroom ravioli topped with arugula, tomatoes and shaved Gouda (so good and burst of flavours!), duck breast entree that came on a very crispy potato latke and veggies (delicious, we loved this dish), and the apple walnut quinoa salad. 

We had to wait for a new batch of quinoa to be made and was notified by our server at the beginning and decided to wait (25 mins or so). When it came, the quinoa salad was disappointing - bland and lacking flavour which was surprising as the other two dishes were of such high calibre. Definitely needed some citrus/vinegar and maybe spice and more veggies to bump the flavours up. 

Also had the Sage and Fizz to drink, pretty good and I like anything with ginger beer! My friends had the quinoa salad (same review) and enjoyed the smoked duck and pork roast. I had a piece of the smoked duck and loved that as well. 

Overall was a great experience and excited to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I was seated at the cooking bar and I had a great experience interacting with the cook. Food was awesome. I will go back."}
{"text":"Went here for an anniversary. Amazing decor and atmosphere, however, very tiny! Service was fast at first, but a little disorganized. Our waiter immediately came and explained the menu and took our drink orders, then another waiter came and proceeded to do the same thing. Kind of annoying when you're trying on a date! We ordered the smaller sized portions of the mushroom ravioli and seared duck, which were delicious. Our food took a little bit longer than expected, about 20 minutes when no one was in the restaurant, however the quality of the food made it worthwhile. The mirror into the kitchen showed they really made everything from scratch! Very impressive!After our plates were taken away, we were basically ignored for 10 minutes as we waited for the bill, likely due to a large party being served at the same time. I'm not sure if it was just them or the restaurant itself but it tends to get noisy! Otherwise A great experience. I intend to return!"}
{"text":"First time customer at this restaurant and it was fantastic! Didn't know what to expect going in. Came in after the lunch rush on a Thursday and we had an amazing server named Amber. We didn't know what we wanted and she pretty much picked our whole lunch and cocktail experience for us. 
She started us with the butter leaf wraps - AMAZING!! we also had the Smoked Spruce Collins and it was delicious! 
She suggested the  Parmesan Crust Grilled Cheese and the Fish Sandwich for our mains and they were stunning. We had the chips as our side and they were very well done. We had the Kentucky Peach Julep with our meals. It tasted like boozy fuzzy peaches. Then she tried to convince us on dessert but we were way too full so we had her next cocktail recommendation instead, the Oatty. It finished our meal perfectly. We can't say enough on how great her service was, as we had no idea what we wanted to pick the entire time. Amber was a gem and we will be back just for her service, let alone the amazing menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food, cocktails and ambience. The black walnut old fashioned was worth the trip alone."}
{"text":"Ah, I'm in love with Klein Harris! Seriously, one of my new favourite places. After having lunch here, I cancelled my reservations at two other places and booked Klen/Harris instead. 

The room is beautiful. Bright, charming and in the back, a cool loungy/ living room section. Our server Amber was lovely, provided great recommendations and knew the menu very well. Now for the food, the most important part....

Delicious and excellent value. I ordered the pulled duck confit burger, butternut squash soup, mocktail and two little tarts for only $16! My friend's homemade mushroom ravioli is made daily. Delicate and stuffed full of buttery, earthy goodness. I'm coming back to try the lamb, duck, and scallops. Prices are incredible! And did I mention this restaurant is on Stephen Ave? Perfect for a late dinner after attending the Christmas Carol :-)"}
{"text":"This is one of the nicest downtown Calgary restaurants I have been to in forever and I'll tell you why:
*both patio or inside is in a beautiful space with high ceilings and warm inviting space. 
*servers and hostesses were warm and smart. Finally. I remember how I used to love the servers from the old Wildwood Restro (where Wurst is now). Someone that had eaten the food, can suggest a wine without me looking at the menu and can suggest something they love and why. 
*ok so everyone is into canadian and local food. its hip, its local, you feel good about it -but why does a piece meat from 5k seem to cost soooo much. Well i was very (mostly perhaps) impressed that the menu (i was there for lunch) was SO REASONABLY priced. Like i think I had a $12 delish blow my mind halibut sandwich. (ok fair halibut isnt local but you know what i mean). Hasnt Calgary become home of the $19 salad (thats to Earls) and then its another $6 to add chicken. Sooorryy. I am digressing. Anyways- What I want to say is that the prices and the food quality were so good I seriously thoughy about going back the next day(the very next day) as if I had a Klein/Harris meal plan. lol. 

*what else I like. Duh! The Food. It was delishly simple. I had a cajun halibut sandy and it blew my mind. and it was $13. A glass of pinot gris and our bill for 2 was under $50 tip in. Horrahhhh. 
Im in and im love with this newish spot."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and atmosphere.  Pricing is excellent, my fav place on Stephen Ave"}
{"text":"My friend and I had a great lunch at Klein/Harris.  We loved the warm and inviting atmosphere.  There are the usual tables but there's a \"living room\" area with sofas to kick back & relax.  The kitchen is open for all to see with the look of a homey kitchen with cookbooks and knick knacks on the shelves.  I love the décor which adds to the warmth of the restaurant, especially the animal heads made out of wood!  I love the little pots of eucalyptus greenery on each table.

And the food...we ordered:
- Butter Leaf Wraps - tomatoes, sour cucumber, spicy braised pork, crispy onions, garlic chips - I ordered this dish and loved it as it's nice and light for lunch.  I love the crispy onions, sliced ever so thinly and of course, the garlic chips!  The spicy braised pork was nicely prepared.
- Roast Chicken Sandwich - mushroom gravy, onion bun - my friend ordered this dish and it came with a side.  She had the special soup - corn and squash.  She said the \"the star\" was the soup.  She liked her sandwich but not so much the mushroom gravy.  Needed more seasoning, she said.

I like the customer service as they came by often to check on our table and to ask if we needed anything.  

I'll be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow.  The food was original, fresh, excellent prepared, and so tasty!  The service was friendly and attentive. I was really impressed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite downtown spot now. We had the mushroom ravioli and donuts.

The service was great. Have great suggestions.
The house old fashion may have been one of the best I have had.

Thanks!"}
{"text":"Came here with some colleagues for dinner. Our experience was fantastic. We came on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was just about full so I would recommend reservations just to be safe.

The restaurant is well located on 8th Ave and easy to find. The restaurant itself is comfortable and relaxing, with low lighting, adequate spacing and good furniture. There also appeared to be bar sitting infront of the kitchen which I will try next time. Service was also fantastic, our server was very professional. We ordered the three ways toast and lettuce wraps to start and I had the lamb loin. All the dishes were fantastic and reasonably priced.The cocktails were also excellent. 

Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Klein/Harris. I was impressed with the quality of the food and service. I need to eat gluten-free and a large portion of the menu can be prepared gluten-free. They seemed to really care about serving food that was safe for me to eat.I shared the beef skillet with my husband for our appetizer. It was delicious. I had the duck breast for my main course. It was served with rosti, spinach and carrots. I loved it. I had the pavlova for dessert. Yum! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"On an out-of-town business trip so tried it on my own on a Tuesday night. Service was excellent but dining room was not full. Nicely decorated place with friendly (not too stuffy) vibe and unobtrusive background music. Seems like a good place for a date/dinner.

Quality of food is excellent. I had grilled veggie app (nicely grilled, good variety of vegetables) lamb chops (loved the wild rice but squash? cubes were a bit undercooked for my liking). When I tried to poke one of those cubes, thinking it would be fork tender, it actually resisted puncture and the cube shot out (with velocity) from under the fork due to the pressure being applied. Luckily I was sitting next to the wall, and cube fired off in the direction of said wall; otherwise another diner could have been seriously hurt.

The lamb chops were done perfectly, lots of flavor and very tender/juicy. Only complaint is that two medium sized lamb chops is likely not enough for many.

I had a butter tart for dessert (with home made ice cream) -- it was really good and so was the coffee.

Not really a complaint but they gave me over a litre of sparkling mineral water, even though they knew I was by myself. Seems like such a waste.

Big eaters might be a bit disappointed with amount of food, but this was overall a great dining experience, both the service and the food were very good. Price was reasonable for the quality of the meal ($63 all in, but no alcohol)."}
{"text":"From the first dish to the last, everything tasted divine!  You could tell care was taken to design and create each plate.
We shared the diver scallops that were cooked to perfection. Mushroom ravioli and toast 3 ways were wonderful.
I got the smoked duck breast, and I have to say, it was amazing! I smiled with every bite I took! Best thing ever!
Service was attentive and helpful.
So happy to have found this restaurant and would be happy to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Diver Scallops,  1/2 Dozen Oysters, Beet Mosaic, Smoked Duck, Mushroom Ravioli, Candied Pork Belly, Foie Gras Tasting, Lamb, Pork Roast, Doughnuts

Klein/Harris is delicious. Came here twice in a span of 3 weeks because it's that good (from Edmonton). Started with the scallops and oysters. Both tasted super fresh for seafood and the scallops were cooked perfectly and paired well with the farmer's bacon, but what doesn't taste good with bacon? Beet salad is a must for beet lovers. I don't like em too much but these were pretty good with goat cheese. Smoked Duck was cooked perfectly, had the carmelized onions and pan seared apples which opposed that gamey duck taste, so good yo. Mushroom Rav was enjoyable with the blanket of shaved gouda. The Pork Belly was one of my favorites, which was egg in a nest with maple butter...it's basically breakfast for dinner and it was great. Foie Gras had tarragon mousse, candied apple terrine, leek and brandy pate - these were all good spreads and extra bread didn't cost anything. The lamb and pork roast were both cooked so well and was tender and juicy. The lamb sat on herbed wild rice with some squash and turnips. The roast sat on some whipped potatoes and wasn't over buttered, just a good consistency. For dessert, the Doughnuts really stood out as it had salted caramel and chocolate sauce. Whatever you dip it into, it's going to be a good time. 
K/H is on Stephen Ave and close to Centre st, this is a prime location. Very accommodating to our large group, great service and even better drinks. Can't help but mention how good the cocktails and the price of them alone are worth the trip to K/H. They really boast Canadian cuisine and it really shows with oysters from the Maritimes and mushrooms from BC. Definitely a place to eat and drink.

Ben says: candied pork belly DM"}
{"text":"Looking for dessert? The reviews on Yelp made this restaurant standout & it was good to see they offered a dessert menu and were open later than most of the dessert/bakeries nearby. It's very unassuming from the outside, but inside the dining area has modern cottage type vibe with the 3D cardboard mounted animal heads, and knick knacks displayed in front of the mirrors on the wall. Kitchen is open & in full view. It's bright & airy, there's even 2 sections of large couch seating to lounge at if you prefer complete with a coat rack...the folks I was with even commented that it was like an episode of friends. It was not busy given that it was late on a weeknight. Service was friendly, quite attentive, and fairly quick. Dessert menu was affordable at $7 each and sounded appetizing. They were sold out of jelly rolls, so we ended up with butter tart with ice cream, frozen cheesecake with berries, and donuts with salted caramel & chocolate dipping sauces. They were plated simply, but still appealing, my pictures couldn't do it justice; and they were delicious too...hot fresh donut holes, chilled cheesecake in a small jelly jar, rectangular shaped butter tart... with a satisfactory size to end off a large dinner. If I ever come back to Calgary, I'd like to eat here again to have a go at their lunch or dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Cannot recommend this spot more. Pro tip sit at the food bar. Excellent high end food in not so high end digs. Creative food. Sure nice people.  Excellent cocktails. Would be perfect for any occasion. Probably one of the best meals I've had in a while"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious meal! The duck breast was amazing! Service was impeccable. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Out for a weekend trip out of Edmonton, landed here for dinner and I was a little skeptical of the menu because they didn't have anything to accommodate my craving BUT they pulled through with great quality food. (Little pricey but not crazy)

The service was very kind and seated us exactly on the patio where we requested without a problem. 
The quality of our meals were excellent and really presented well. You could really tell they put an effort into the preparation and presentation. 

My boyfriend ordered the duck and he really liked it. I got the arugula beet salad. It was one of the best salads I've had. Definitely not a meal in itself so I also ordered the soup they had. Overall great experience.
I recommend this place for dates or if your okay with spending a bit more for meals."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this place out for lunch because we had heard so many lovely things about this restaurant, and we weren't disappointed! We were seated right away by the friendly hostess, and our waiter was very helpful. One thing I really liked about Klein and Harris is that the kitchen is located in the heart of the restaurant, so customers are able to watch the chefs prepare their food. 
Once we ordered it was a little bit of a wait before we saw any food, but it was definitely worth it. The pork belly was succulent and perfectly cooked, I would go back for this dish! 
After our meal, we ordered desserts - the cheesecake (which we devoured before I could take  pictures) and the donuts. The donuts were such a pleasant surprise, I was expecting cakey sugary donut holes, but these were light, airy, and just the right amount of sweetness. 
In all, it was a pleasant first experience and I'll definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Excellent and interesting menu. Booking procedures a little sloppy. Cocktails worth exploring- not as sweet as many places, which is great"}
{"text":"Had the Maple Smoked Collins - best drink, I'd come back just for that! Great presentation with the flavoured smoke at your table and perfectly balanced flavours. 

I enjoyed the food - particularly the appetizers. Crusted Boursin was to die for. There's only one vegetarian main so that was the main drawback for me. 

Great value though! Bill was very reasonable for the amount we ordered!"}
