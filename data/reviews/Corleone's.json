{"text":"I had lunch here and to be honest its the first time I've ever eaten a cheese steak sand which. That being said it was dee-lish the steak was cooked perfectly,the roll was fresh and soft but had a bite and a nice chewiness. Lunch was a little pricey at$10 for a regular sand which but it was definitely worth it. They just started delivering and I'm lucky enough to live in their delivery area. If your in Tempe on mill ave and want a great cheese steak make sure and check out Corleones."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch and ordered an Italian hoagie. I know they are known for the Philly cheesesteak, but I felt like some Italian meats. This sandwich was right on point, filled was lots of delicious deli meats. I godfathered it and added pepperoni. The regular size was so huge I could only eat half. The guy at the register was nice and even remebered us and said here's youse guys order without calling our number when it was ready. The oil and vinegar is what I normally add on my sandwiches and theirs was great. I've ordered Jimmy John's Italian night club when I go there and if you've ever had that Corleon's is 100 times better. Its about the same price and at Corleon's the meats are way better quality, a bigger sandwich and overall tastes way better. The only negative thing I have to say is there was no napkins in the bag and I forgot to grab some when we were waiting. I definitely know where to go next time I'm craving a sandwich and even though the Italian hoagie was great I'm going to try the cheesesteak."}
{"text":"One of the best philly cheese steaks I've had.  Have not really had anything else from them, but when I order this is pretty much what I get.  They deliver and that is awesome!  Really great if you are looking for a philly cheesesteak.  They chop the meat up very small and diced though."}
{"text":"Grade A cheese steaks at a reasonable price. Probably one of the best places to grab a philly in the PHX area. I'm so glad this place uses cheese whiz!!!"}
{"text":"This place is decent.  I would recommend the chicken cheesesteak and pass on the fries; the fries aren't that great.  Kids liked the chicken nuggets."}
{"text":"Excellent food especially Philly Cheese SteaksMediocre customer service. I've called in an order and people have kept me waiting for 4 to 5 minutes. Ive hung up, waited another few minutes and then have taken my order in a rude manner. Overall this company has great food and horrible customer service. NOTE TO CORPORATE: Train your franchises and owners to have way better customer service this probably would have grown your business faster......"}
{"text":"I received a coupon for joining the Corleones V.I.P. Club and another for my birthday for one free small sandwich. I usually go to the 16th st and Camelback one, but since they opened this one its closer to my house.

I brought the coupon into the store and the guy behind the register stated it was expired. I didn't see the expiration and told them it was my fault, no big deal.

I went home and printed my other free sandwich coupon and proceeded to call the Corleones and place my order for pick up. This is 20 minutes later, and I call in my order and the owner gets on the phone, has an attitude that I'm the same person and that he threw out my Philly cheese steak a few minutes earlier. The owner inquires about \"what other, coupon\" I have, with an abrasive tone, indicating I made one up. At this time I am very appalled that the owner of Corleones is actually talking to me like this and immediately ask, \"is this how you treat all your customers,\" then proceeds to tell me he doesn't need my business, and hangs up the phone.

Frankly this is a pathetic way to treat a long times Corleones customer, to say the least, I will not be recommending this place to anyone based on such horrible customer service by the owner himself and will be taking my business back to the 16th st and Camelback Corleones. Obviously this translates down to his employees and they will most likely see it OK to treat people like crap.

This owner thinks he's too good to be cookin on the hot grill and servin Philly cheese steaks....c'mon buddy?"}
{"text":"After giving up on Luke's many months ago, I've been looking for a place to get my beef on. I'm not sure why it took me so long to build up my courage to try this place, but I finally ventured in today for lunch. While not the best sandwich I've had, this definitely fills the need. Juicy flavorful sandwich with super soft fresh bread. 

The place is REALLY clean. They've only had 2 major health violations in the nearly 2 years they've been open. Most restaurants typically have 2-3 PER VISIT. 

I had the 6\" cheese steak with provolone and grilled onions. I loved that the grilled onions were thinly diced and not the typically stringy style. There was the perfect amount of them, not a heaping distraction from the great steak. 

The fries were perfectly crispy (slightly overcooked, which I love) and hot. 

The diet coke tasted great as well. 

All this for under $10? Not too bad. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've never been to phili but if the food is as good there as it is here and the people are just as nice I might have to make it my next vacation destination."}
{"text":"Don't tell me the delivery will be 45min - 1hr if it's going to be 1.5hr. Now 4 people have missed their lunch hour and will have to wait hours to eat the cold delivery. 

Don't ask me on the phone if I'm paying in cash, not tell me the total, then NOT give your driver any change. Are you effing kidding me? he's 30 min late instead of telling me $40 is ok instead of $42, he tells ME to go ask coworkers for $3 since he can't break a $20. NO APOLOGY OR explanation for the lateness. 

Worst customer service, never ordering again. I signed up for yelp just to write this I'm so irritated."}
{"text":"Was feeling in the mood for some NY style pizza, and this seems to be the only place anywhere close to my house that has a 16+ incher for a non-retarded price.

Well, got the pizza and it's just so-so. Asked for extra sauce, and though the guy repeated that in my order it doesn't seem to have it. Doesn't matter anyway, as the sauce tastes like what you'd get in spaghetti-os. They also douse the top of the pizza with some not-very-good spice combination, so you can barely taste the cheese or crust.

Oh well; guess that's what I get for wanting NY pizza from a place all about Philly."}
{"text":"I tried the delivery again... You don't even find out it's going to take almost 2 hours for it to arrive until they have your money... I live less than 2 miles away and ordered two things. Warn me first so I can pick another delivery option when I'm hungry.. Food actually showed up in 40 minutes so I feel better now and increased by one star, I'm one of the lucky ones... The food is always good. Nothing amazing though. If you want amazing try the Luke's of Chicago on indian school and 16th st. OMG.. They don't deliver but had to share."}
{"text":"I would have gave 0 stars but I was forced to give at least one star the pizza was terrible they should stick to cheesesteaks"}
{"text":"I tried out Corleone's today for lunch and I could not believe the size of the lunch. For the money it was a great value. I thought the bread was a little soggy but it was good.  The place was crowed but the guy working was working hard. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Automatic soap dispenser but a manual paper towel machine... Make up your mind!! Are you pre-2010 or not?"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with 2 colleagues and we all ordered different sandwiches. All of us ate every bite and commented that the food was really good. Plus, as we went for lunch, we were in and out in about 20 minutes. And the fries are really good!"}
{"text":"came to Arizona for a relaxing weekend and ended up at this HORRIBLE place. First i ordered a custom pizza and the ingredients were horrible blank no taste and the sauce taste like nothing. I paid $20 for a small pizza not worth it. But it does not stop there. There was a married couple were the girl wanted the whole place to listen into her personal life with father in-law issues! A man approached her to pipe down and that started an on going fight from verbal into mild physical! yet this went on for 15 or more minutes and the manager or workers said nothing from the beginning to these people to at least get them out. Never again will i make the mistake of coming here! Were was the boss?"}
{"text":"My brother just moved to Tempe from the Philly area. I've always heard that its difficult finding good pizza or cheesesteaks out west. I took the trip out with him when he moved a I was surprised to find a solid cheesesteak joint right in the town he moved to. The guys working there are legit Philly guys and know whats makes a proper steak. I'm glad my brother will always be able to have a taste of home whenever he wants.Go Birds!!!"}
{"text":"I find it hard to go anywhere else but here for Philly Cheesesteaks!  You guys rock!!!"}
{"text":"Philly Cheese Steak was Great, and their french fries are the best!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband I love this place for a few reasons. 1-they deliver! 2-original philly cheese steak sandwich! We also love their wings! We usually get delivery but we've eaten inside a few times too. Haven't had anything I didn't like so far (knock on wood)"}
{"text":"I'll take my steak with onion and Provolone, the only way a steak sandwich should be made.. If you like \"wiz\", someone should wiz on your sandwich.. Talk about a fake cheese product..
I like the onion rings over the fries. Sure you can go somewhere else to get a steak sandwich for less, but $10 for a combo is a good deal. Its not a $5 footlong (icky)
They serve Coke products the only way to go!"}
{"text":"Cannot beat the 2 slice + drink for 5 bucks. Guys behind counter are nice and the food is good for the price."}
{"text":"Took almost two hours to deliver 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas. The food was cold, and the driver did not even apologize. Then he almost for ot the drinks. The worst part was that a tip of $7 was added when the order was placed. They have very poor service and their food is below average, I would choose another place to order from if I were you."}
{"text":"Pizza is great here, affordable, and fast. Friendly staff. I love the the cheesesteaks and sandwiches even more.  One of my favorite buffalo chicken cheesesteaks/sandwiches I've ever head, just the right amount of spicy!  I come here at least once a week and will continue.  My only complaint is the fans here are on super warp speed and tend to blow any loose papers or napkins around easily on your table."}
{"text":"I read these reviews, and ordered anyway.. BIG MISTAKE!! Soggy, cold, WAY overpriced... back to pizza hut and jimmy johns if i need a meal to come to me"}
{"text":"Since 0 star is not an option I have given them a 1.  Horrible !  Walked in and guy behind the counter told us we would have to wait because he needed to make a call to the owner???  Not a good start.? Maybe?   The pizza for slices looked like it had been there for a couple days, not gonna order that, and it should have been a clue. Told the girl working the register we needed a minute to decide, there were no other customers in line. 
This little goblin  stood over the register fingers ready, staring at us. We asked for the kids meal mac and cheese on the menu for our 4 year old.        \" Oh we don't really have that \".  ok . We both ordered cheesesteaks without the wiz. 
Dry, cold (how is this even possible), and generally disgusting. The bread was so stale it crumbled off.
This place is horrible. Dirty. Strange AND WAY OVERPRICED. If they are trying to be authentic to the philly tradition with dickhead attitudes and rudeness, they could at least have their food be authentic. Apparently flooding everything with \"wiz\" is their definition of philly.
ROCKY WOULD PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE CORLEONES,  YOU SUCK!!!"}
{"text":"Holy Spinach!  

So, my partner and I ordered the vegetarian version of their philly cheesesteaks.  It was slimy spinach, a little onion, a little pepper, a little cheese, covered (slathered, soaked, drenched) in oil and vinegar.

I didn't request oil or vinegar, and it wasn't an option presented to me online when I ordered.  And the spinach... oh, my, gawd.  I grew up on a farm in Southeastern Ohio and I've never seen so much spinach crammed into such a small place.  Seriously - there are other vegetables.  Lots of other vegetables.

Their onion rings, though, are pure art.  They are the most delicious onion rings I've ever put anywhere near my mouth, with the exception of Oak Creek in Sedona and Sun Up in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Service was awful. The food was ok.

I ordered their Italian hoagie which was probably my first mistake because they are known for their cheesesteak. 

I noticed I had been waiting for 15 minutes so I started looking to see where they were with my order. My sandwich was sitting in the back while some employee wandered around that was supposed to be making it talking about hitting on some girl and getting her name wrong. 

10 more minutes went by so I asked where my sandwich was at the counter and it had been ready to go but left it sitting back there. 

The guy who made it asked me if I wanted anything extra in apology but I just said no thanks and left. 

The sandwich kind of sucked. It was average at best and absolutely not worth the 30min wait"}
{"text":"What do you expect when you order 2 slices of Pizza and your total is $13.30? Definately not a half done mediocre looking slice of Pizza. Go here if you feel the need to overpay. I got two slices of cheese pizza with the toppings thrown on top to where they weren't even incorporated with the cheese! Never going back there!"}
{"text":"REAL DEAL Philly cheesesteaks! I only get the original wiz wit....Best I've had in AZ. I recently had a trip in philly and tried both Pats and Geno's. Corleones is right up there with them! Personally, I like Corleons better than Genos. 

I took a couple of friends from Texas, today, and after a few bites one of them said to me \" this is amazing! you just ruined it for all other cheesteaks!\" Everyone else nodded in agreement, to busy to talk as it would ruin the moment."}
{"text":"This Jersey pizza snob has finally found a great pizza in Phoenix! Nice to be able to enjoy local instead of waiting to travel back east. And delivers too!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Corleone's, food was mediocre as expected, also the real reason I'm writing this is because I got a heavy scent of bug spray or chemicals. After I realized this the napkins I was using to wipe my face with had the strong scent.

I'd have to be pretty hungry to ever eat here again."}
{"text":"My husband really likes this place, he likes the #1.  I think the fries are good.  I have had a pizza silce, it was ok.  I also found the service slow and unfriendly."}
{"text":"Waited an hour and a half for fries and a sandwich to be delivered. I live less than ten minutes away and the food was cold. Will not order again."}
{"text":"Solid Philly sandwich.. Staff is a little cold but that's ok bc that means it's run by Philadelphia natives."}
{"text":"Okay so I've been coming here for a year now and I  usually get the to slice to go with the pretzel because I love Philadelphia pretzels and for the last year I've been allowed to use my $2 discount it comes on every receipt until today when apparently some new girl explains for some reason or another I'm not allowed to use this coupon well that's okay because I can live without the Philadelphia Pretzel and get pizza someplace else goodbye Colon it was nice coming here for a year but apparently it is time to move on."}
{"text":"Cheesesteaks, chicken cheesesteaks, cheese fries, pizza and wings are always great. Drivers are friendly, and the food always shows up fast"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! Philly cheese steak is AMAZING & delivery is fast, good still hot! Eating as I type ;)"}
{"text":"I've been here more than a handful of times and the food is ok, the subs are better than the pizza and the prices are good. Staff comes off as a bit rude and disinterested but it's not enough to avoid the place"}
{"text":"Having had authentic Philly cheese steaks, I can tell you this is spot on.  Best I've had anywhere outside of Philly.  My son says the pizza is awesome too but I haven't had that.  I love this place!  Only problem is that I have to go clear across town to get to it.  Wish they'd open another one closer to West side."}
{"text":"I remember a couple years ago when there were four Philly cheesesteak places on Mill Ave. Corleone's drove them all out of business. You can't compete with these guys. And hailing from the city of brotherly love, I like to think I know a thing or two when it comes to the perfect cheesesteak. 

I usually order a cheesesteak with mushrooms and whiz (Cheese Whiz). Corleone's packs their cheesesteaks with savory meat and drizzles the steaks with the Whiz, which glistens on the sandwich. For you Philly peeps who like Pat or Geno's, you're sure to like Corleone's.  You can even order a Tasty Kake for dessert.

If you live in the Mill Ave. area, the restaurant delivers."}
{"text":"I like using this place for their slice of steak and maybe a drink for about $3.60 as either a decent lunch or  to take it home and have it with a salad for dinner. It's a cheap and quick meal and tastes really good. The fries are pretty above average too. The people who take your order behind the counter are pretty gruff, but they consistently deliver a good product and have seen them be accommodating to other customers by wiping down tables for them and apologize they were less than clean so that really impressed me."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for when you use wiz and Sysco steak-um. Nuf said."}
{"text":"I like the food here. The pizza is good, as well as the cheese steaks. But the food isn't the problem. It's the attitude that you occasionally come across. The only person that I've noticed that has an attitude problem is the manager. He's never said anything to myself or my friends when we've dealt with him, but  maybe that's half the problem. He just looks miserable and isn't very friendly.. The experience with the other staff that I have encountered has been good. 

Someone said try going to Philly without getting an attitude in a restaurant. Lol, that's why I'm never going to Philly. If Philly and the attitudes are so great, why don't you go back there?? I prefer to stay here, where better customer service is the norm. Anyways, I will continue to go here for now, but if we encounter anything more unfriendly than what we've already experienced, you can count me out.."}
{"text":"I love going to this place to get a Philly Cheesesteak sandwich. The prices are great."}
{"text":"Service can be slow in the evening. The Wiz is worth it though. I really love that you can order for delivery directly through Yelp. Talk about convenience! 

If you're a Tastykake fan, like my girlfriend, don't count on them being in stock."}
{"text":"It took 50 min to receive our cheese pizza and wings (on a Tuesday night)... That's why they lost 1 star... However, their food is ahhhmazing. Whenever I get a coupon (they're all over!) I jump on ordering delivery for my family. The wings are awesome! The kids meals are very reasonable, and perfect for my son. I always end up stealing 1/2 his French fries."}
{"text":"great lunch specials and good staff, for $4.99 you can get a sandwich, chips and drink.. not bad on Mill Ave"}
{"text":"BEEN HERE twice with in a week. On my second visit found a hair in my Philly cheese steak took it back to the front and showed them and  they didn't even care just took it back didn't even say sorry or anything. Last time I go there"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the customer service is horrible with the cooks the girl in the front is great she is always smiling"}
{"text":"tl;dr version:  Corleone's will spam your cell phone mercilessly if you give them a real phone number to work with.  Some people probably don't mind this, but I sure as hell do.

Don't get me wrong - the food is alright and their delivery is fairly reliable, but all of a sudden they've decided to go all-out with an unbelievably intrusive marketing 'strategy'.

I've ordered from them about once a month for the past 5 months, never signed up for any 'loyalty' (translation:  \"Sell my personal details and spam me mercilessly\") program, nor given them any permission to contact me for anything other than the particular order I've placed.

As of today, I've started getting unsolicited txt messages (3 today within 2 hours) from Corleone's telling me that I've been automatically signed up for their 'spam my phone' service and then asking for personal details like birthdate - allegedly so I can get some birthday bonus or whatever.  

In my world, Corleone's now sleeps with the fishes - I'll get my pizza and cheesesteaks elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding. People that work there are horrible!!!! I understand being proud of your business, but these guys are just cocky and rude. The guys that work the cash register talk smack about the other locations in the state, are no help to the customer, and are so unprofessional. They also close early (over 20 minutes) if there are no customers. I went in 20 minutes before they closed and they already had the floors mopped, grill off, and the employees were in the back cussing. I went in and the person working said oh sorry we turned the grill off 10 minutes prior to me walking in. Then two people came in behind me and the employees cussed (the f word) at them to get out. Horrible staffing makes great food bad!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat. Pizza is really tasty especially the buffalo chicken pizza. The cheesesteaks our out of this world. Only its a little pricy. However if you join the text or email club you get a lot of discounts and free on birthday. If you order to go you get coupons. Try them right away"}
{"text":"Alright,
I see this place has gotten a half and half of good and bad reviews...what I want to say is that if you do not like this place then you do not like eating...period. \"I don't like processed cheese\" or \"the buns aren't good enough\"...wtf? Like I said, if you don't enjoy the pure pleasure of good food regardless of whether or not they have the buns 'you remember from the old days' then you are not a foodie. I ordered the Original Regular size and should have ordered 2 of them because they were sooooo good!! I ride a bike everyday to school about 10 miles everyday...when I need to eat I need to eat and this place delivers with outstanding service and food. If you don't like Corleone's cheese steaks then you don't deserve a Corleone's cheese steak...period!"}
{"text":"Philly cheese steaks are good, the bacon cheese and steak and cheese fries are basic. I made my order for delivery at 5:38 they didn't show up until 7:30. They called me to tell me they didn't have enough bacon for 2 bacon cheese fries like 40 mins after I made my order, lol it's always funny when a business \"runs\" out of stuff. Overall it was ok I wouldn't bother going back again."}
{"text":"No Stars wasn't available, Come here if you want to be treated like you are doing them a favor by buying their overpriced sandwiches.

I guess they serve \"Philly Style\" customer service also."}
{"text":"I am from the Philly area and never miss a chance to get a cheesesteak and a hoagie when I go home.  I tried both at Corleone's and the results were mixed.  The cheesesteak was just about right.  Although it needed a little salt, the bread was good and the steak tasted very good.  I don't like cheese whiz, so I was glad that there was a choice.  There is no consensus on that particular choice at home either (I almost never see cheese whiz in the suburbs, where some of the best sandwiches are made).  I was trying to figure out whether to go with 3 or 4 stars as I tried the hoagie.  I went with three.  The hoagie was not good at all.  It had way too much ham, not enough of the spicy Italian meats, the provolone was not prominent enough, and there was not enough oregano.  So this is a great place to go for steaks, although a bit expensive, but I would steer clear of the hoagies."}
{"text":"I went to Corelone's upon my friend's recommendation, and I was super excited to go because not only are her recommendations spot on, but I also love me some good sandwiches. I went there and got two sandwiches, first the italian (not one of their family favorites) and the infamous Wiz. The italian was mildly impressing, I was semi-half impressed by the freshness of the meat and I was extremely excited by the pepper bar. That is where all compliments end. I asked for oil and mayonnaise on my bread and I was devastated to realize that there was a drop of oil and maybe a slab of mayo on the sandwich, the sandwich was extremely dry and was definitely NOT worth that awful price tag. If I combined the sandwich meat from Port of Subs with half-the goodness of Jimmy John's bread, plus extra $2 dollars, that's what my sandwich would have been like. Simply put, I was disappointed.
But ALAS! I thought my friend couldn't have recommended me here if it wasn't actually GOOD. So I gave it a second chance, after finishing the italian, I got the Wiz. It was equally as disappointing. When I received it, my face fell immediately. It was something that I could have made with ingredients from walmart for $5.00 less and 6x the more sanitation. The service here was lackluster, the person who made my sandwich came from outside, came back inside, and without washing his hands proceeded to make the sandwich and I was more than horrified.
The sandwich was not that good either. 
I'll give it 2 stars for the pepper bar."}
{"text":"It's extremely difficult to find an edible cheese steak sandwich in Phoenix,  but I discovered a shop that does it right! Tucked into a shopping center on the north-east corner of 16th St. and Camelback is a place that has the best cheese steaks in Phoenix.  They also offer pizza, pretzels and wings. They have a condiment bar with sweet pickled peppers that are a great accompaniment to the sandwiches.  We always order too much food because everything we've tried on the menu is a little taste of Philly. Oh well,  it re-heats nicely."}
{"text":"I love the Philly sandwiches!! The fries with cheese whiz are amazing too!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I originally gave this place 4 stars but I am now giving it about 2. The food is good but the service is just horrible. Typical Philly style is to be a little douchey but this place goes a bit far. The manager (tool that looks about 45 and divorced 3 times) has a huge attitude. He also seems to hire only other dudes that have his same attitude. We go in here about once a week and even though this place is pratically empty everytime the people in there always act like they have never seen us before. So to sum up, douchey dudes with horrible service and food is hit or miss now. Though when it is hit then its pretty damn good but there is no way to know what mood the staff will be in. So try it and maybe youll get lucky but most likely you will be disappointed.
I'm not usually a fan of chain places but this place is A-OK! It is a little bit pricey, about $10 for a full size sandwich. Their fries are pretty generic and come frozen out of a bag so dont expect spectacular there. Whenever I go there I get the Steak Italiano, its got provolone, steak, onions and spinach, it is very very tasty! The steak is cooked to perfection usually and all the toppings are chopped up and mixed in nicely. They of course have the classic wiz wit cheesesteak, Im just not a fan of the wiz. The only reason I dont give this place five stars is because of the generic fries and the service. I wish I could give this place 3 1/2 stars because the service is usually pretty blah. The teenagers or college dudes working in there act pretty authentically Philly for a chain place in Arizona. And by authentically Philly, I mean pretty down with the \"I dont give a shit\" attitude. Overall I give this place a \"It doesnt remind me of Nancy Reagan, so Ill be back!\" ;"}
{"text":"I love Corleone's.  I couldn't believe it was so hard to find an authentic philly in such a big city but Corleone's  is pretty dead on, right down to the soggy bun and wiz.  personally, not a wiz fan, but the fact that they have it is great .  Not sure why people are complaining about something they chose to put on their sandwich.  TASTYCAKES TOO!

The employees have always been nice when i've been there, not the typical brand of pushover yuppie that has taken over Tempe tho' so maybe thats why some of the more \"sensitive\" folks have taken issue w/ good natured teasing.

East coast atmosphere and east coast food,  on the expensive side for being a cheesesteak dive but it's worth it since you cant get them anywhere else in this stinkin' desert :)"}
{"text":"Love the food and the staff is laid back and friendly.  You can't go wrong with the Original and don't forget to add fries.  Take in a little Rocky while you eat."}
{"text":"I order from here at least once a week using Eat24, and I have never had bad service, or the wrong order. The staff seems responsive and respectful. Plus the food always great!"}
{"text":"Very first time I tried this a year and a half ago, and  it was great, I loved it. Everytime I have gone in since then seems like it has gone down hill. I like ordering the underboss, and it has turned in to very bland chicken cheesesteak. Not even the onions and cheese help add flavor to the sanwhich.  The fries are always cold and stale. I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"We have gone to this establishment a total of 4 times.  3 of the 4 has produced in inaccurate orders.  We are entertained by the theme but extremely annoyed by the service.  We have never ordered anything off the menu but these cooks seem to not know their own menu.  Additionally we ordered a combo, drink, fries and sandwich for myself but when my husband did the same thing but said he wanted a beer the clerk charged him for a beer and drink.  We realized the mistake after we ordered as my husband only wanted a beer, no other drink the clerk said belligerently we asked for both.  Really?  Isn't that his job to ask about what drink he wanted?  So why was 3 drinks appropriate for 2 diners?  Regardless we paid and have remembered to never go back."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with their large $2 cheese slice. It was heavenly"}
{"text":"Twice a year treat. Love this place for lunches during the Winter and Spring street fair. VERY pricey, but the cheese fries are delicious. Worth trying at least once in your life! Can get crowded, so be warned!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I love a good Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches...So when I heard about this place I had  try it.  We made the drive down there...park in the parking garage off of 5th st.  Walked to the resturant and was pretty impressed.  Place was really clean, guys behind the counter were as nice as philly people can be.  Then I looked at the menu, saw what I wanted to order and ordered it.  I ordered an full size cheesesteak with cheese wiz...i made it a combo.  I was shocked that it came out to like $13 for a sandwich, drink and fries.  When I finally got my food, I was impressed with the taste but don't know if it's worth the $13 I paid for it.  If you don't want the combo, the full sandwich is still $9.  So if you want a good sandwich, be prepared to friggin pay for it."}
{"text":"Torn on this one because usually it is much better. However, this last time left me less than thrilled.

Came towards the end of lunch, the place was packed. There were a lot of campers, so really not a place to sit, and there isn't much room to start. Perhaps they had some sort of A/C issue because they had some huge...like HUGE fan/external cooling unit thing sitting in front of the bathroom hallway.

There were 4 people in front of us and it took about 20 minutes to get our food, not so good if you are in a hurry...and we were.  We ordered two cheesesteaks and an order of fries to share... fries were $2+ and barely got a handful, felt pretty ripped off frankly. Even more so after the wait when I took a bite to find out the fries were lukewarm at best. sigh.


I am hoping this was an off day and not a sign of change.  The food is delicious and the fries are (usually) worth craving... 

I'll be back, hopefully I will have a more positive experience next time.   And hopefully they open one in the SW Valley sometime, that would be cool ya know!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Cheesesteaks are delicious. Huge pizzas with taste to match. Reasonable prices for the amount of food you get. This place had not disappointed since the day I first found out about it."}
{"text":"I stopped by with my family last night, to grab a few cheesesteaks. It was 8:51 p.m. The website says they're open till 9 p.m. The \"open\" sign was turned off, and chairs were stacked on many of the tables inside. Obviously they were not wanting my business. If your hours say you're until 9 p.m., I don't think you should turn off your neon open sign before 9 p.m. 
Many customers will rightfully assume you're closed, or your staff is going to be disgruntled having to serve somebody so close to closing time.  I went elsewhere, and found a new favorite"}
{"text":"Food is always good. Pizza is great for the price. They are always very friendly. Cory is great."}
{"text":"Yum!! I always get the Italian hoagie and it's delicious and always piled high. I've eaten in the store as well as pick up and it's always consistent. I've only dealt with the male workers and they've always been very friendly to us. Everything here is very well priced which I love."}
{"text":"After enjoying a drink at a nearby bar I decided to grab a bite to eat at Corleone's.  The first thing I noticed was the pizzas sitting near the counter waiting to be served by the slice and they looked really good.  Since this is a Philly place, however, I opted for the cheesesteak.  I am slightly biased against Philly's most famous cuisine (I prefer pizza, hot dogs and kebabs) but they offered wiz as a cheese selection and I have not come across many places outside of Philly that offer whiz.

Overall I was impressed with the steak but it wasn't great (I've had better in Philly and here in Phoenix) and they were skimpy on the whiz.  My biggest grip was the price.  It came $13.38 for a steak, fries and drink.  That's too much money for the amount of food and quality.

But I will be going back to try the pizza because it looked really good.  If they can sell me on the pie I just might have to reevaluate my rating."}
{"text":"Food isn't bad. Service is mediocre at best. 
I wanted to try cheese-wiz so my wife went up to ask for a side. Had to pay .81 for something that was disgusting. So why the one star you ask?  Here it goes. While paying for the side of nastiness the employee working the register was wearing gloves. Following the transaction he went back to making food without changing his gloves.  I'm not naive, this can happen anywhere and I know it does. However, don't be so blatant about it."}
{"text":"I have to preface that every time I've visited this location it has been after midnight and I might have been pretty intoxicated. With that said, yummy yummy drunken food! I love that they are open after the bars close. I love to get a side of hot sauce to dip my sandwich in. Nice tool to soak up the alcohol."}
{"text":"They use Cheese Whiz, what else is there to say? One of these bad boys and you have a meal, and believe me, i am a big guy. Been to Philly many a time, and these are the real deal on cheese steaks. Worth the trip, and is my favorite fast food here in the valley"}
{"text":"\"OK-OK-OK!\" 
If you are on a diet most definitely this is not the place for you! 
If over paying for a Philly Cheese steak, they call it \"a large,\" I was wanting more when I finished my Sandwich, again not the place for you!!! 

However if you want to walk into an authentic Mafioso looking deli-restaurant with a sandwich, an epicurean delight, that will give you multiple foodgasms than \"Yo, how you doin'!\" 

All I'll say is that the smooth taste and texture of the Philly Cheese steak sandwich was incredibly flavorful, and beyond delicious! Enough to have your eyes roll back in your head and possibly shout \"this is so f¢ing good!!\" 

When you walk in this joint there is a large profile picture of Don Corleone, Marlon Brando, with the words; 
\"Make 'Em A Sandwich They Can't Refuse!\" 
Now that's a Slogan! 

They even have a real Pickle Bar with banana peppers, hot peppers, and homemade salt pickles. I loved it!!! 

\"Bing, Bang, Boom!\" I scarfed mine down and I wanted more."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years!  FOOD IS STILL GREAT!  They recently have hired this rude Hispanic girl to run the register.  She is so rude - hence the 1 star.  This trash should be in the back washing dishes.  She creates a negative first impression for those that have never been here before.  The guys are awesome!  Just need to weed out the rif raf employees crating a negative impression."}
{"text":"Great Philly Cheesesteaks!! Yummy antipasto salad and can you day \"What a deal!\"? 2 big slices of cheese pizza as ND a refillable drink for $4.99! The staff is all super nice!!!"}
{"text":"Best and most authentic Philly Cheese Steak in Phoenix!  
And they have Peroni!
Try it!
Only downside-  no table service. Bummer for those of us who want more than one Peroni."}
{"text":"Great good. Def w be back. Philly cheese has much meat and not disappointed. Toasted bread, onions w chiz wiz on my philly cheese, yummmmm."}
{"text":"We stopped in after the AZ beer fest. Pretty good cheesesteak! The fries were really good - piping hot and crispy! We also tried a slice of cheese pizza.  The pizza was ok. Fresh baked and hot.  But I had to add a good amount of salt and pepper to bring out the flavor and jazz it up a bit. But if you're looking for a decent size slice that is definitely not the worst pizza you've ever had you can't beat it at $2 a slice!"}
{"text":"Not to bad cheese steaks are good but little to greasy for me bread tasted a little off but good portion of meat but the people that work here are unfriendly or just no personality mite go back to try a slice"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Philly. Absolute BEST cheesesteak I've had outside of Philly...EVER!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza. The staff is also always on point. I've tried many pizza joints in AZ, this is definitely in my top favorites. The wings are really good too. I wish they were still on GrubHub. Whoever the owner is, they are hiring the right people. I'm always welcomed and my order is made quickly. This is the type of place where you look for the tip jar."}
{"text":"My fiance has been talking about this place for the last few months. He regularly frequents this place for lunch with his co-workers and has been waiting for the day that I got to try it too. Well, the day came when he brought a pizza from Corleone's home for dinner. Short story is that I LOVED the pizza so much that I demolished 3 whole slices - and their slices are not small. 

I have yet to try their sandwiches which seem to be their specialty but the fiance loves them and he was right about the pizza so I'm sure I'll be happy once I get my chance to taste test."}
{"text":"I stopped in today and ordered a cheese steak with provolone and mushrooms. I also got a side of Buffalo sauce. The bread, meat and overall flavor was really good. I would have preferred my roll was toasted though. My only other peeve was that all the fans were on high and I had to weight down everything paper (i.e. napkins, whatever is used to served the sandwich). I didn't poke around too much but what I saw was very clean & staff was friendly/knowledgeable. I will definitely be back and will refer to others."}
{"text":"Ok. Not sure if it was the food that made me sick yet or what. I ordered a hoagie. Not the turkey one... and it started out tasting really good. Then my stomach started to hurt and I didn't feel so good. Here it is the next day and my still a bit blah. This was my first time there. This was also a delivery order. It was pretty fast. But I dont think I will go back. Just the thought makes me a bit weary now."}
{"text":"The food as okay but not great and the staff was not prepared for anything. They ran out of ketchup for French fries and then ran out of four of the six types of soda. And this was in a Tuesday. I most likely will not return"}
{"text":"I was craving a cheese steak and went to this place yesterday. One cheese steak was almost 10 bucks and I didn't get fries or anything with it (maybe that was extra) the meat in the sandwich tastes just like that frozen steakum crap you get at the grocery store and it was dripping with grease. Yuck! One of the guys behind the counter was kind of an ass too. I will never eat there again!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because I like pizza and subs, which is what they do. But after giving it two tries two days in a row, I have to provide my \"completely honest review\" to you. So here it is: 

Day 1: I ordered a turkey sub. It took a long time to arrive. I mean about 15 minutes. For a sub. I know, right? And I was in town on business so was dining with a few coworkers. They each had a similar wait. 

Was the sandwich worth the wait? Not really. It was mostly bread and just a little meat. They threw some mayo on it, but it's probably my fault for not asking for more stuff. If that was even an option. Which I don't know. But I do know the sub needed more. A lot more. 

Now in fairness, I should tell you that they do provide a free, small fixins bar. This contains an assortment of peppers and pickles. So I could have and should have doctored it up with some of that stuff. 

Day 2: I came in with a coworker for a quick slice of pizza before we headed back to the airport. Except it wasn't so quick. I ordered a single slice of pepperoni and they went to heat it up for me. This was a nice touch. 

I got to talking to my colleague and lost track of the time. I also wasn't expecting to get my slice fast because my long wait from the previous day was still fresh in my mind. So after another 10 or 15 minutes passed, I went to ask about my pizza. 

The server went to the oven, opened it, and stood back as a big cloud of smoke came billowing out. Oh they didn't forget to put my pizza IN the oven. They just forgot to take it OUT. And we were literally the only two customers in the place.

They heated another one up for me. And did not burn this one. The pizza was average but not bad. 

So all in all, not the greatest experience either time. I'd probably just pass on this and go to one of the other spots nearby. There's a much better pizza place just two doors down."}
{"text":"I have been going to Corleone's for a few months now because I wanted to try several things on the menu before I judge the place. Being a fan of Philly Steaks I thought this place would be good by the classic look of the place. 

I got the tuesday night special where if you get 1 large sub for 10 bucks (without a drink of fries) you get a small one for free. It was interesting because I saw a lot of people order a large sub, and they weren't notified of the daily special. So I ordered the regular philly steak with a small hoagie.  He asked me if I wanted mushrooms or peppers on my philly steak, and i said yes, and I didint know that was an extra charge. 


The Philly Steak was mediocre at best. They use low quality meat, and overcook it. The bread could be a lot better.  The guy suggested I put oil and vinger on the small hoagie I got, and I know why because it sucked! Covering it with tons of oil and vinegar is not gonna do the job if it's bad to begin with.

The only thing good here is the pizza and the fries. Stay away from everything else as it's also overpriced! $13 bucks for a philly steak combo? are you kidding me? Tell people about your specials, and stop penny pinching people for extra money. Tell me if peppers and mushrooms will be an extra charge. 


In my opinion if you are gonna eat this bad for this price it might as well be good!"}
{"text":"If your soaking up the Sun and sights on Mill Avenue and want take a break from the action, I recommend stopping by Corleone's for a genuine cheesesteak. I had the Philly Original, \"wiz wit.\" Cheez Whiz on an Amoroso roll topped with grilled onions and frizzled rib eye steak...bada bing!  Other cheese options include American, Provolone, and Mozz. 

My only suggestions for improvement would be to dust the Amoroso rolls with corn meal and offer a broader selection of hot sauces. They also serve pizza (whole pies and slices), hoagies, and salads. Give 'em a try and tell 'em Paulie sent ya!"}
{"text":"I like this place better than Uncle Sam's (heresy).

The biggest complaint here on Yelp is that it is a bit pricey, and it is compared to (say) Charlie's.  But the quality of the meat is very good.  Thin sliced rib eye, no gristle or fat, tasty.

And Uncle Sam's is about a buck and a half more expensive.  That evens out if you order mushrooms, which Sam's includes but for which Corleone's charges extra.

And I like the condiment bar.  A little garlic powder, some banana peppers, perhaps some oregano and/or parmason cheese.  Season to suit.

The price gets helped out with specials and coupons.  Your cash register receipt is usually good for $2 off your next visit.  They have specials for a six inch sandwich, fries and a drink for $5 (would be closer to $10 without the special). {Edit: that might no longer be true.]

I've not tried the pizza.  I'm not a big fan of NY style pizza, even though I lived in Manhattan.  Other's have given it thumbs up, though."}
{"text":"They messed up my order and I ended up getting 2 free pizzas from the mistake. Great customer service and delish!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood and family pizza place. Good thin crust pizza and cheesesteaks (make mine wiz wit) and the deals can't be beat for value. $2 beer/ margs too!"}
{"text":"So yummy and they don't skimp on a thing. I got it delivered to my work and they were fast, definitely a place I will frequent for some much needed food when I'm at work all day."}
{"text":"Decent Cheesesteak especially after a late night out on the town!  Lunch line type service which is very fast and friendly and expect the line to be out the door if visiting during late at night hours."}
{"text":"This place is great! We have enjoyed their sandwiches for years, but the real surprise is their pizza! Seriously- it pretty good! My wife thinks it may be that they use better ingredients. Who knows- they could be using the \"soylent green\" for all I care- their pizza is great and at a bargain price too!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Corleone's Friday nite.  I was whining that there was no one out here who could make a good east coast pie with a thin crust.  The guy said he was from Jersey and that the pie would be great.  It looked like pizza hey I'm from New Have home of the best Pizza in the world.  When I bit it to my first piece I could have wept.  It was fantastic. Prices are amazingly reasonable and I am so happy that I found you guys!!!"}
{"text":"Love the cheese steak here, actually does really good delivered, a testament to the high quality bun!!"}
{"text":"Pizzas are good. And it ends there.  Service with a smile is an unheard of concept... I get the east coast \"attitude\" thing but i think here its more of \"when is it closing time\" for these employees.  I was charged for xtra toppings on my cheesesteak and when i got the sandwich... No toppings!  Then it was an argument with the cook so i had to bring my philly up to the line to SHOW him there were no toppings!  Overpriced... Bad customer service... But free delivery... U decide."}
{"text":"Whenever my nephews come to visit they FORCE me to order corleone's kids chicken nuggets. They come in fun shapes which they like and they like the lemonade! I would have given 4 stars but one time they forgot ketchup which was the end of the world for the kids! Also both times it's taken an hour for delivery, which is a long time for me! I got the godfather hoagie one time and it was pretty good! I would try it out!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my most recent visit to Corleone's. I was greeted by the cashier who didn't seem too thrilled to be working. I ordered a cheeses teak sandwich wit onions and cheez whiz since they say this is the traditional PHILLY way to order a cheese steak sandwich. The sandwich came with fries and a drink. 

This steak sandwich looked very tasty with the cheese oozing out of the sandwich. The french fries were awesome and had a nice crunch to them. Onto the sandwich....I thought it had a good amount of meat but the imitation cheez whiz didn't do it for me and waaay too salty!

I noticed a few other guests were ordering the pizza and that looked amazing. I will give Corleone's another chance but next time I will try the pizza or swap out the cheeze whiz and replace provolone cheese."}
{"text":"*edited  When I wrote my original review I was hangry.  Waiting 2 hours for a food delivery order will do that to you.  
I eat here often as the 16th street location is near my work.  The food is usually pretty good. If this were a dine-in only review I would probably give the place 3-4 stars.
However this review also takes into account my one and only online delivery order and that brings the score down quite a bit.
Today, I was stuck at work over my lunch break so I put in an online order for delivery.
The confirmation came back and said it would be 1 hour, which I thought was a long time since the sandwich takes 10 minutes and they are only 8 blocks away. (Jimmy Johns is right next door to them and they are usually here within 20 minutes, different restaurant, I know!)  Anyway, 1 hour came and went, then 1h30m, finally at 2 hours my food was delivered...or someone's food was delivered.  My sandwich was wrong (asked for no onions, got onions, asked for iced tea, got soda, asked for side of cheese wiz for my fries, got none).  The fries were cold and soggy also.
I called the restaurant right away.  After talking to an employee for a few minutes, he gave up and transferred me to the manager.  He offered to remake the food and send it back out, but having already waited 2 hours I asked for a refund instead.  *long pause...okay, I'll refund your card.  I am giving back a star for the willingness to correct their mistake and refund me.
So long story short, dine in, don't get delivery, you will be much happier with your meal."}
{"text":"I ordered a large cheese pizza and some steak fries. The cheese pizza had a nice sweet and light red sauce and the crust was thing but not too thin just perfect. The pizza slices were also very large perfect for folding your slices while eating! Steak fries were pretty hearty and perfect for a hangover cure."}
{"text":"Gotta try the Philly Cheesesteak wit Wiz. Yup- Cheez Whiz, the orange stuff from a can. It's a bit salty for my taste but not bad. I came here for lunch and against my better judgment, I went with the 6 inch....

Go for the foot long! (That's what she said.) 

I also wished they gave me more fries with my meal, those are good. As I was leaving, there was an after 4 pm special so it may be worth trying after dark because unless you want to spend about $8 on a so-so Philly Cheesesteak sandwich, then go for it. 

Overall, I would go again but not excitedly."}
{"text":"philly cheesesteak with extra wiz. the best! bogo tuesdays! bogo tuesdays! bogo tuesdays! (bogo=buy one get one free)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would. Here is the story of my awful experience.

 I work near by this Corleone's and it's convenient to have a place that delivers since leaving for meals isn't always an option. We have ordered from Corleone's before and even though the price is WAY to steep for what you're getting we make the exception from time to time. Well this time I wish we would have just ordered a friggen pizza from up the street. I placed an order for delivery at 5:30pm. My place of business is about 15 minutes away, I was told when placing the order that it would take 45min to and hour, I figured \"eh they're busy so it'll take a little longer\" and brushed it off. After 1.5 hours passed I called back and spoke to the young lady who answered the phone. She let me know that the driver had just left and would be arriving any minute. A little peeved about the delay but still I understand what it's like to get busy and fall behind so I let that go. After ANOTHER 30 minutes pass we make another call and we are given nothing but excuses, that the delivery driver has been having car trouble etc. When asked to speak with the manager on shift I was placed on hold for 10 minutes. Now with all the time I wasted screwing around I could have had dinner from somewhere else by now and be done with it, but my card had already been charged according to the young lady on the phone. After being on hold for 10 minutes I hung up and called back. I shared a few words with the staff there about the incredibly long wait for my food and knowing that it has now been in a car for delivery for AT LEAST 45 minutes I asked for a refund of my money, the young lady complied with a refund and to bring fresh food for the inconvenience. Moments later a delivery driver shows up with a pizza in hand and announces that he was lost for 30 minutes, and instead of  calling just continued to drive around. Now, I didn't order a pizza only sandwiches were ordered. So he showed up TWO HOURS LATER WITH THE WRONG ORDER!I let him know that we had new food being prepared at that time. He replied with an attitude that he had to go back to the restaurant to get our meal, and it was his fault in the first place! At this point a coworker called into Corleones to even confirm any of our order information. The person on the phone began to argue with her, and told her that our meal couldn't be prepared because the kitchen was closed!! 

Needless to say this was BY FAR the worst customer service/dining experience I have ever had. I will NEVER be eating here again, and I will be disputing any charges made to my credit card through my bank. How this establishment is still in business with a work ethic such as this is beyond me. Save yourself the trouble, if you want any food in this genre just order Streets of New York."}
{"text":"I am from the east coast and I haven't found an awesome cheesesteak until I ordered from here! And there is no delivery fee."}
{"text":"I really love this place. It never fails to be high quality and delicious. My only complaint would be the amount/type of seating, but that is just a mere location issue. And as far as cheese wiz vs. provolone or whatever people use on their cheese steaks, I think it's however you prefer it, and I know people from Philly that take it both ways."}
{"text":"That was the best Philly Cheese Steak I've ever had! The Steak was perfect, juicy, but not greasy. But mix that with Kraft Cheez Whiz, grilled onions on a toasted hoagie roll... I dont know how it could have been any better. 

Oh wait, it was, the fries made it the perfect American lunch. They were amazing with the Cheese Steak. Golden, crispy and delicious! 

I am so full though, couldn't even finish the fries, I would definitely get a small if it is your first time, you won't be disappointed! 

All of that wrapped up in a fun old time feel, with tall booths, wood tables and Philly memorabilia that made me miss the East coast all over again. They had Sports on a couple TVs and the movie Rocky playing on another. The music was a nice background, and not too loud, so you could hold a conversation. 

The staff were really nice, but the service was really quick for being so busy. It makes me want to come back over and over again! 

Found a new favorite!"}
{"text":"I saw the good reviews on yelp and thought I'd give it a try. I will never go back. I had a slice of pizza, topped with meatball and mushrooms and a half order BBQ wings. The meatball looked like it was frozen meatballs and you can tell the mushrooms weren't fresh like they were from a can! The BBQ wings were unevenly warmed up. There were spots that were hot, some spots that were lukewarm, and some spots that were cold. I ended up not even eating all of it AND I got sick! I can't believe I paid as much as I did for that food."}
{"text":"Great for what it is.  Sometimes you just want a greasy fatty cheesy juicy meaty ball of deliciousness wrapped in a bun.   You know it's awful for you.  You know you'll regret it with a bloated overstuffed belly.  But damn it's good!  This place delivers on all levels for that.  Excellent cheesesteaks just about however you like them.  Cooked fresh.  Fries are fresh too.  The pizza isn't bad if you like a plain Jane slice of NY style pie either.  Is it gourmet.  No.  Is it great for what it is.  Absolutely.  Now get a samich, take an extra dose of cholesterol medicine and don't tell your cardiologist!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Ordered online took over an hour to arrive and still arrived wrong. They called to tell me that they were out of chicken nuggets a half hour into my order. Which was fine, then 25 mins after that I get another call asking what drinks were ordered. Finally the food arrives after an hour and 15 minute wait. It was cold and completely wrong. I called back to tell them of the mistake and The so called \"manager\" gets into an argument with me saying the order was correct and the best he could do was 20% off my NEXT order. No offer to fix or replace so I tell them to pick up the sandwich and just refund me and I get into another argument saying he can only refund minus the tip because he would be in the negative. Seriously, OVER A FUCKING CHEESESTEAK. 15 mins he calls back and says I voided the card for you. What a joke. I would never order from this place just off the fact that if something is wrong you have to pull teeth just to get your money back. A simple sorry and a refund or an offer to send the proper food out would have been nice. Instead they want to make everything difficult and argue with the customer. 

Working in customer service myself I have learned that in no circumstance should you argue with anybody. It's just common sense.  I've refunded people for a lot more than a shitty 12.00 sandwich without blinking or arguing. I know if I didn't I would get fired. But then again I could always apply at Corleone's and tell every customer to fuck off and be just fine. There is definitely a reason to this location is getting 3 stars overall."}
{"text":"Yo, ya gotta be freakin kiddin me!

Why is it so hard to get a decent cheesesteak in AZ?  I know there are tons of you Phili invaders out there.  Can one of you open up a cheesesteak spot that is original, delicious, at an affordable price?

I've been to Corleones a dozen times or so.  The only reason I go back is b/c there are no real other options.  You are talking a 3 at best flavor wise cheesesteak for $14+ if you get fries, and a drink and leave a tip.  What a rip off.  

The guys here are always cool but the price vs product just doesnt make any sense."}
{"text":"The folks working at this place have that inner city \"charm.\"  Except when they act like they were pulled off the streets, unbathed and ready to make your sandwich.  You have to fight for the flea's attention span of the guy who's taking your order over his shouts to his friends outside, the television, and the other people working with him.  
The cheese-steak  wasn't that bad, although my cold fries were covered with lukewarm cheez wiz.... nasty.

This place is nothing like the location in phoenix.  It's like the diry little brother of the phoenix location.

Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Fries= bomb.
Cheesesteak=bomb
Place= bomb

They just need to clean up a little bit. Bathrooms were a little dirty."}
{"text":"These are authentic cheesesteaks, but I just realized that I'm not a huge fan of the authentic style. In my perfect cheesesteak (likely outside of philly), the meat and cheese and onions are folded in together to create more of gooey experience. Actually in the hundreds of cheesesteaks I have had outside Philly, this is the way it is prepared. In the Corleone's version, which was still pretty decent, they slather a very thin layer (could have used more) of whiz on the bottom of the roll and put the meat and grilled onions on top of that cheese. All that said, the ribeye was pretty good, but the meat might already have been chopped and placed on the grill because despite what the cook said, I never heard him chopping up my meat on the grill and the sandwich was ready way to quick. The meal was probably a few bucks overpriced (almost 11 bucks for the 6 inch and fries and soda). The fries were good, crunchy, but nothing memorable. Authentic for sure, if you like em that way."}
{"text":"I think if you're drunk you'll eat anything... that being said my philly cost me almost $10 and it wasn't until I got my receipt back that I noticed they added cheese wiz. I can't say that I would choose to eat here or cheese wiz other than at 2 am, but it def. serves its purpose."}
{"text":"Well, succinctly and too the point for you.  I am a native of the original area where the Cheese steak has been made famous (Philadelphia, PA.) and after a decade of trying them here and even longer around the world and country, this has come the closest to the real thing!  It is not a perfect hit but the certainly the \"best\" option for me when I crave a bit of home.  I am not sure of other locations; but, the Tempe (Mill Avenue) location is the one that I will continue to go to.  As a chain, it is pretty darn close to offering an authentic fare and compared to other venues that I have tried they have at least come close to hitting the mark.  This is appreciated too.  The value is decent too since they don't necessarily rake you over the \"cost\" coals for their product.  They are not the cheapest and they are not the most.  They border on being bit pricey at the end of the day.  I have seen their service deteriorate a tad since I fist tried them years ago, but I am not too picky with this \"quasi\" buffet or stand in line, order and wait to pick up your sandwich type design.  Overall, it is just above average to above average; hence, the three stars (3.5 stars really)."}
{"text":"First time lunch customer ordered the regular sized Original Philly with Whiz combo meal came to about $13 no tip. Tad spendy for lunch but it came out as a large portion. Two issues with the sub. The meat is low quality, not rib eye like you'd get in Philly. This is Paradise Valley, lets get some actual steak in your cheeseSTEAK. The problem with many middle of the road places is that the bad ones will always go quantity over quality. Anyway, the sandwich was constructed wrong. They put the whiz on the bread like a spread, like mayo. When what you need to do is put the meat in the bread first, then pour the whiz over the top of the meat. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Good food, nothing is great about it. Large portions. This service is a bit slow. I walked on with only a few people on the restaurant and still takes about 15 minutes to get food."}
{"text":"Everything is pretty good! We have had the philly's, pizza, wings, and fries. Philly is one of the best I've found in this area. The fries and cheese fries are really good. Love that they deliver."}
{"text":"Get chicken Philly with extra chicken, extra mayo and extra provolone cheese! Also try the meatball pizza, it's very good lol..."}
{"text":"Not super impressed. The atmosphere was cool...but the service was very meh..felt like an upscale Subway. My main issue was the price..I got a meatball parm 6\"...just by itself...which felt very meager and it was close to $8. No drink, no chips. Save your $8 and get deli food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best philly cheese steak EVER!  To this day we compare this sandwich to any others... We always agree Corleone's won.  Try them out.  We like the shredded meat, veggies and cheese they use.  Used to be exclusive to Tempe, but they have started franchising throughout Phoenix.  5 stars no doubt!"}
{"text":"Sad place for a cheese steak. Back when they first opened they were pretty decent, now this place is a joke. Also when ordering over the phone they place you on hold for 10 minutes before they decide to assist you in placing your order. The hold tone is silence with a loud beep every 5 seconds it's maddening. There delivery range is LAME and there food is soggy and has no flavor..... This place is a JOKE"}
{"text":"Would like to have rated the restaurant better, but unfortunately I cannot eat there as I am 5.2 miles away from Corleone's and there delivery radius is 5 miles. Nope, not kidding, called in for delivery, was asked for my address after a 2 minute wait, was put back on hold and the woman came back on the phone to tell me, \"i am sorry, we dont deliver to your area\". My response was, \"uh, we are 10 minutes down the road, what is your delivery area?\" Her answer \"the delivery area is 5 miles, you are outside of it.\"

TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, COMICAL REALLY."}
{"text":"We had a Philly steak and a Philly chicken and both were fantastic. My wife loved the fries, I thought they were okay. They are very crispy so it's probably just a matter of preference. The restaurant was very clean and the staff was friendly, we will definitely return.

Update: we returned the next day for two more philly steaks - yum!  While there I noticed someone getting a pizza and it looked great.  We returned again the next day and got a pizza and it was fantastic!  

Also, they offered a nice toy to my son which made him a big fan - nice touch!  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. I stopped in for lunch expecting hair a quick mediocre food and it totally exceeded my expectations!! I come here all the time. Super nice staff and amazing food. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The owner was very talkative, but I wouldn't call him rude. He was actually quite nice. I didn't get any attitude for changing my cheesesteak to no onions with provolone instead of cheese wiz. It was delicious too. I wish they had this place in Chicago.

{"text":"We wanted a quick lunch and they were close. We ordered their  steak sandwich with cheese whiz. We also had their buffalo chicken sandwich . Service was quick and the staff was friendly.  The bread was fresh from the oven . Both sandwiches were great . The bread was nice and crunchy on the outside . You need to eat immediately other wise it will be a little soggy. The fries were plentiful"}
{"text":"These cheesesteaks are the best! Get them with cheez wiz or provolone - Tuesday afternoons, the one on Camelback has buy one get one free on their subs. Trust me - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My friend really talked this place up so I was excited to try it, but we both walked out disappointed. I had the Chicken Italiano which is marinated chicken with provolone, spinach, and grilled onions.  This portion of the sandwhich was actually really good, but the bread was awful!  It seemed like it had been pulled out of a freezer. My friend was also disappointed in his cheesesteak, inside and out. The fries were quite tasty though :)  For $9 a sandwich, give me fresh bread!"}
{"text":"Best Service, Best Cheesesteak in the Valley IMO. Staff is super friendly and makes sure you feel at home.  This is super cool when you're tired and need a bite to eat after work. I need excellent customer service when I'm tired and they give me that. I'll continue making my weekly visit when I'm up this way. Two up!"}

But, I meannnnnn....it's a serious fart factory if I'm being 100% real. I will d finitely eat here when horribly hung over and have at least 24 hours with the windows open....just sayin'"}
{"text":"Yo, Youse guys better hit up dis joint if you know whats best for you.

According to their t-shirts, New Times likes it.  What other proof do you need?  Okay, okay.  I give it my stamp of approval too.  Here we go.

Great Philly's... They call 'em cheesesteaks, I call 'em philly's... Who cares.  Watch out though, they'll dump a bunch of cheese whiz on your sandwhich if you don't ask for provolone.  Oh, also... if you want peppers on your philly, you have to ask for it.

Great service!  We even changed our order at the pick-up window and they had NO problem fixing it!  Fries were great with the supplied... wait for it... MALT VINEGAR! Yay!!!!!!  They have state of the art ice tea machines that make you feel like a rocket scientist when you use them.  The provolone is mixed in with the steak before they put it in your buns (ouch!) so it is nice and meltilicious...

The decor is godfather meets rocky balboa with a twist of 1920's depression. Yes, yes... it IS industrial decor like all the new chains, but it fits!!!!!

Thinking of going somewhere else for a philly? Fogettaboutit!"}
{"text":"My coworker/friend and I visit this little \"gem\" only once in a blue moon just because of the prices.  If we could go based solely on the food, we'd probably be there at least once a week.  The original philly cheese steak sub with cheese wiz is to die for, but man are they overpriced!!  You can't get out of there without spending over $20 on two people for lunch... for fast food, I consider that a little on the spendy side."}
{"text":"I've been to Corleone's a few times now, and it's not terrible. I couldn;t really pinpoint what it was, but none of the toppings really had that \"oomph\" you look for in a great cheesesteak. I must admit, I was a little disappointed. Philly cheesesteaks are just a classic food and I was really expecting a little more, especially for the price. It's not that the food is bad, but the price is definitely high for the taste. I just have a hard time spending that much on a cheesesteak when there is a Jimmy John's (much cheaper) and a Five Guys Burgers (delicious) just a little down the street. One upside, though, is the Cheez Whiz. That stuff, in my opinion, is a great way to make Cheesesteaks and one of the main reasons I wanted to come to Corleone's in the first place. There just aren't that many places around that offer Cheez Whiz for their cheesesteaks. I'll probably be back only because of the convenience of the location. I know that I'll catch myself craving another great cheesesteak (as I do often) while I am near here and end up going in to give it just one more chance, only to be disappointed as I was the other few times I went in."}
{"text":"Their pizza is good. I ordered a cheese pizza with all the veggies. It's thin crust which I like and I probably would go there again. Being from the East Coast though I am not convinced that they are accomplishing their goal of east coast style pizza. The crust is soggy and not crispy like I am used to. Also, the veggies were not fresh. I would much prefer Red Devil."}
{"text":"I should know better than to go against the yelp family when it comes to trying some of these places. Seriously this place was like a trip to the doctor and you find out you need to get your colon checked. Not fun but necessary according to some people. I do not eat out very much anymore but can not say no to a cheese steak sandwich. Something about that thin sliced meat, onions, and melted cheese makes me feel like all is right in the world. But with my first bite of over cooked, cold, and tasteless meat I was kicked in the meatballs and brought back to reality.

It amazes me that a place that seems to focus on one thing does such a bad job at it! It is like McDonald's and their crappy burgers, or taco bell and their mystery meat/refried bean concoctions. Why can't these places stop with all the dorky names and just work on making their food taste better? Corleone needs to start by adding seasoning to their meat while removing some of the grease (what you can see through the bag? Forget about it!!) Listen I do not mind a little grease but if your bag starts to dissolve due to the amount of fat dripping out of the sandwich then we have a problem. Also for the price ($14) I could have purchased a rib eye steak, sub rolls, an onion, steak fries, slice cheese, and a 2 liter of soda and made enough food for 4 people! A sandwich with fries and onion ring (ok to be fair there were about 4 in the bag) for $14 was not worth the effort to get it, or money spent to eat it. Pass this place on by unless you like being made an example of, the example of a sucker that is!

Btw saying a place uses Cheese Whiz means nothing as the stuff sucks and you can buy it at the supermarket."}
{"text":"Pizza here is pretty good. Cheesesteaks could use some work though! Meat is not seasoned and bland. There also isn't much meat on the cheesesteak, which is especially disappointing given the price. Bottom line: go for the pizza but skip out on the expensive cheesesteaks, they aren't worth it!"}
{"text":"Finally an authentic cheesesteak! Best cheesesteak in town! Can't have enough of it! Prices are okay but different worth it for a good cheesesteak!"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches reminds me of cafeteria food in Junior high school.   Best used for a food fight.  Save your money and go to chipotles next door."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I ordered a beef sandwich loaded with veggies, they didn't hold back either! They really put the feed bag on. The staff members are very friendly the atmosphere and music mix well with the food. We will be back to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"I think the food was decent but it was 40 minutes after their promised time and we weren't given a warning or apology.. Nada."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and Philly Cheese steaks. I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"A tasty, convenient spot for lunch/dinner. A slice of Philadelphia right in our own back yard."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. The meat on the Philly was flavorless they nickel and dime you for mushrooms, peppers and onions. The cook had a problem with his spatula when he wasn't cooking he was banging on the grill making music which was very annoying."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a Sat night at around midnight after drinking.  There was a fresh pizza coming right out of the oven as we walked in.  I ordered two slices, cost me $4.50 so cheap!  Delicious pizza and steaming hot.  The cashier was super nice and friendly, and unlike Paisan's next door, gave me a free cup of water!"}
{"text":"Tasty overall.   Good cheesesteak but a little pricey.   7.50 for a half sandwich with the works.  Add 2.50 for soda and fries.   Good philly memorabilia on the wall."}
{"text":"Awesome cheese steaks and friendly service, what more could you ask for??"}
{"text":"I really like this Philly cheesesteak. To have provolone cheese and such is really nice. 
I've always liked cheesesteak but this one of the best.
Really good service.
Place is clean."}
{"text":"this Philly girl was extremely happy :)  I was shocked to find a cheesesteak place that truly reminded me of home! but make sure you get 'wiz wit out' !!  Tiny tiny little place .... we were there in the middle of the day on a Saturday before school started so service or lines were definitely not a problem.  I can definitely see this place being crazy busy at around 1 am on a Friday night :)"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place 2 times now, to be delivered to my work. I have not been disappointed! Even being delivered, everything is still hot and fresh went it gets to my office. I think these are the best Phillies I've ever had. I can't wait for my husband to try them!"}
{"text":"Despite 5 employees all with Philadelphia hats on, I'm guessing none of these Phoenicians has ever been to Philly and had a cheesesteak. They just could not get it right. The cheese was not at all mixed into the steak. The guy put it on like it was mustard or something. Hardly any steak either. I had to move half the steak onto half the bun and eat it or else it would have been all bread. Place is also dirty."}
{"text":"I would give this a 3.5

Their cheesesteaks are HUGE!! The Regular ($9) can easily feed two people but probably not ravenous men. Also this is kind of random but I had a bite or two of fries from M, and they were really good. It was really crisped and seasoned nicely. I don't know why they stood out so much but it did!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over the years and feel that they serve the best Philly Cheese Steaks around!  I love the atmosphere and great location in the heart of Tempe!  Their AC can't keep up with the Summer heat in August.. that would be my only complaint."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Corleone's previously and liked their food.  I ordered delivery through Eat24 this evening.  After placing my order, I received confirmation that the order would be delivered in 45 to 60 minutes.  After 65 minutes, I contacted Eat24, asking about the order.  The Eat24 representative indicated that he had been told that the order would take an ADDITIONAL 30 to 45 minutes to deliver!  At that point I indicated that I would cancel the order.  Apparently the Eat24 representative spoke again with the manager and by some miracle, the order would be delivered in 10 minutes.  So, the order did arrive in 10 minutes, but the person delivering was not apologetic for the delay and blamed the regular driver for the problem.  When I opened the order, it was incorrect.  I believe they need to work on their delivery problems before they offer this service if they cannot delivery a quality product in a timely manner."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Really good pizza and lunch specials. The staff is always super friendly!  The atmosphere is fun for a pizza parlor and its local reputation is super positive. I know businesses around that area that eat here religiously."}
{"text":"Another great pizza delivered in 30 mins, not the 60 that it quoted. Very happy again."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Coming from PA, I know a great cheese steak and Corleone's is the best outside of PA.  I love that they sell Tastycakes as well...yummy!"}
{"text":"Did you love Cheese Wiz as much as I do???

Best damn Philly Cheese Steak in North Phoenix.
And the bread it comes on is soft and tasty.

I HIGHY recommend Corleone's.

Hope they open a location in Laveen one day cause Uber Eats won't come this far. Lol"}
{"text":"The BEST Philly Cheese Steak in the valley! They actually use the correct ingredient that most places don't use....CHEEZ WHIZ! And of course you gotta get it wit grilled onions! They are always quick and have some really great specials. They also have some of the best French fries, of course I get the cheez whiz on that and it's even more delicious!!!! I will continue to come here!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  By far the best cheesesteaks outside of Philly...hands down!  The rolls are perfectly soft, the whiz is the authentic best and the meat is just right.  Super friendly staff, clean restaurant...and good pickles too!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give them no stars but I didn't have that option.  I ordered food for delivery once and they took an hour and a half.  They got lost and didn't bother calling me for directions even though I gave them my number specifically for that reason.  My food was cold and I didn't get my entire order.  They suck! Don't eat there."}
{"text":"Average at best - nothing separates this food joint from a run of the mill fast food. We only tried Philly cheese steaks and salads. Great Decor and clean are the best attributes. No reason to hurry back..."}
{"text":"I come here quite often since it's close to work and not too expensive.

I love this place for a couple or reasons.  Consistency and a decent cheese steak.  I'm born and raised in AZ so I don't know what a \"true\" Philly cheese steak tastes like so for me this place is pretty darn good.  The bread is always nice and soft and the steak is great with the whiz and onions.  Their fries are always perfectly crispy and soft on the inside every time.  

They have pizza as well but I don't ever seem to be in a pizza mood when I go here so I've yet to try it.  I'm deducing a star on this because the chairs and tables are in some serious need of replacing and there is a lot of dust on the walls and upper ledges above the booth seating.  I've seen enough episodes of cooking shows to know this isn't acceptable.  

Great food though and I will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"The original, which they recommended, was marginal.  The fried cheese was disgusting...how do you mess that up?  The marinara that came with it tasted bad as well.  Ordered pizza for football team and it was late and a hassle.  Poor communication.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"These are definitely the best cheesesteaks outside of Philadelphia!  

I am not sure why the reviews aren't that good other than the reviewers must not know what a true Philly cheesesteak is supposed to be.  Believe me, I grew up in PA, so I have eaten my fair share of Philly cheesesteaks.

The restaurant are clean, the staff is extremely friendly and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"We met a group of friends here for lunch and a couple are from the Philly area. We all enjoyed our sandwiches and had a great time. I'm glad the restaurant wasn't packed so we could easily move all the little tables together for our large group. It was a hopping place, so a lot of people must have been getting their sandwiches to go."}
{"text":"Ordered \"the original\" w/jalapeños - $10! Not even a combo. Only ate half. It was filling - but is the taste/quality worth the money? Nope. I'm assuming it has to do with location.
The look of the pizza was not appetizing. The cheese looked dry which is one of the reasons I didn't order it.
The inside was clean & organized so I appreciated that!"}
{"text":"they have a heart clogging philly cheese steak  sandwich with wiz as they call it which taste damn good had the chicken philly as well not as good this place attracts alot of dudes also serve pizza and a varity of other sandwiches"}
{"text":"The staff is horribly rude. We placed an order through Door Dash. When the delivery driver called us to confirm that part of our order was unavailable, she said that the restaurant had already notified us. No one had called us from the restaurant. The restaurant told our delivery driver that they called to notify us of the items that were unavailable and \"fixed everything\".  That was a lie. When I called the restaurant to ask them about this, the girl who answered the phone was insanely rude. I told her that no one had called us about the order and she replied \"Oh, so you know how we work. Do you work here then I guess?\"  That's amazing customer service. Congrats. Hire new staff"}
{"text":"Thanks for delivering my pizza in a timely manner while still hot. You would've gotten 5 stars but I prefer new york style pizzas better."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, I want to let everyone know that I enjoy their food. However, as with most of the other Yelpers, I have to agree that the service is lackluster at best. 

As for the food, I really enjoy their Turkey BLT sandwich and their cheese fries- soo good! And by the way- they have buy one get one free regular sized sandwiches after 4PM on Tuesdays, meaning that two sandwiches, two drinks, and two bags of chips are only around $10. Slammin' deal. 

However, each and every single time my boyfriend and I come here there is ALWAYS an issue with the service. 

For example, one Tuesday we came here and ordered the BOGO sandwiches. Mine was the Turkey BLT with everything on it and his was the Turkey BLT minus the lettuce and tomato. We waited nearly 50 minutes to get our food which was absolutely outrageous considering that there were maybe 4 other occupied tables in the restaurant. Not to mention when the food came out, my boyfriend's sandwich had lettuce scraps on it (the lettuce is shredded). No, they didn't put lettuce on by mistake and leave it there, they put it on the sandwich, must have realized that it was incorrect and then haphazardly picked it off. This is what really bothered me. If you make something incorrectly, make it again. For all they know, he could have had an allergy to the lettuce (which he doesn't, but still the same principle applies) and he could have gone into anaphylactic shock. Not cool. Whatsoever. But since he's not allergic to lettuce, he just spent a good five minutes picking the remnants away. 

Another Tuesday we came here, and it was a night where the Flyers (Philadelphia's NHL team) were playing in the first round of the playoffs. The place was at about 1/4 capacity. Being a Philadelphia-oriented restaurant, we were shocked to see telenovelas playing on TV. So, after we ordered, I got back in line and waited my turn to get to the front counter. Once I got there, I politely asked the guy working there if when he had a chance if he could turn on the Flyers game. He looked me dead in the face and said \"Yeeeeeah, that's probably not going to happen...\" Shocked, I said ok and walked back to our booth. One of the patrons behind me must have said something to the guy because he walked over to our table and mentioned something about how he told him what channel the game was on. So rude and belittling. Not to mention we waited another 30 minutes for our food. 

The third time we came here, my boyfriend ordered cheese fries to go and THAT'S IT! He waited 25 minutes for french fries and a cup of cheese wiz. Really? And not to mention, they must have sat the to-go bag down on a wet counter because as we were carrying the fries into our house from the car, the soaked bottom of the bag tore and our fries ended up on the floor. Really not cool. At all. 

Overall the service sucks, but the food is good. Oh, and just a tip for you guys, if you feel like you're going to want Corleone's for lunch, order it at 9:30 AM for it to be ready on time."}
{"text":"Corleone's have great Philly Cheese Steaks but they will run you about $6.50 and if you add fries and a drink that will run you another $2.50 and it with tax you are talking about $10 for one person to have lunch.  They do have a great lunch special at this location two slices of Philadelphia pizza and a drink for $4.99.  I have yet to try that but from what I seen the slices are huge and are good ( per a co-worker of mine )."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for quite awhile because of the Philly Whiz.  There is something about rib eye steak grilled up with onions and cheese whiz!!  Only downside is if you want the value meal with the regular sized sandwich you are going to pay $10+."}
{"text":"Being from Philly this shop wouldn't be open.  It is ok for Phoenix but a true Philadelphian knows a good cheese steak when they eat one.  There is barely any meat in the sandwich, little to no seasoning, the condiments are plenty by they don't  make up for the lack of substance of the cheese steak."}
{"text":"WARNING!!!!  EXTREMLEY RUDE EMPLOYEES!!!!

If i could give a half or quarter star i would!!!!!  But one star is the only option.

You wouldnt beleive how the staff treats you here. Completley unprofessinal and these guys have no idea what the word Hospitality means, BTW, no part of my story is inflated or exagerated!! Everything is right on

Came out to Tempe to watch the Angels spring training games, Saturday the 21st of March, around 430pm after the Angels and brews game we headed back toward our hotel and stopped by this place to give them a go. i go inside with my buddy and his fiance. I ordered first, got the cheesesteak hoagie togo. once he hands it to me i asked if i could get a side of ranch. he grabs it and as he hands it to me he asks  \"are you putting that on your sandwitch\" I replied with a Yes. He then rolls his eyes and gives me a huge sigh, Then he actually tells me that if he'd known it was for the cheesesteak he would have never given it to me...... Excuse me, I just paid you  $10 for a hoagie and your going to stand there and tell me how to eat my cheese steak.. My friends and I are completley blow away by the way this guy is talking to me. very unprofessinal. By this point  he's standing behind the grill and has stopped cooking even though he had orders there and begins to get into a verbal confrontation with me. Looks toward my friend and Starts yelling at him as well. Then the indigent looking Cashier comes by to back is patron up, completley oblivious to whats been happening. The funny thing here is that  back at the room I'm telling my brother about what happened, he just begins to laugh, and he tells me he was there friday day and the exact same thing happened to him. Thats not it though, this happened to my friend the night before because he didnt hear them calling his name to pick up his hoagie,   Well that friend ended up walking in to use the bathroom and gave me a higfive, the guys look at him and tell me they were yelling at him last night because he forgot his cheesesteak. It seemed as though they were trying to backpeddle and use him as an excuse to why they where being complete douchbags toward my self and friends. But he didnt even know i knew him till he gave me the high five as he walked in. I though it be best to walk out side and just leave things the way they where, I was obviously not getting anywhere with these guys. 

Now the hoagie was good. I've never had it with wiz and i have to say i enojy it a bit more than with the provelone. So, Sandwitch good, But incompetent employees BAD!!!!  And its sad to say this but Corleones will never see my money AGAIN!!!!    Even if you had the best cheesesteaks in the world pissing off your guests isnt a good thing for business. Funny, i have two friends that work at Tavern, and Another a zuma, And a waiter at La Bocca.  They all told me I'm not the first to be treated this way, I know im not local but you never know who your talking to. 

Angry cook, dont get to comffy at this place, I say give an education another try cause you didnt seem to bright as is. Cashier, shave your beard...you look homeless.  Corliones, Great cheesesteak but that was my first and last one!!!!"}
{"text":"Wit Wiz is where it's at.  I was surprised and pleased to find an authentic cheesesteak in Tempe.  The large size was more than enough for my wife and I to share."}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend who wanted \"a sandwich\" when we were on Mill a few days ago. We were instantly greeted by the owner of the restaurant and given the \"run-down\" of who he is, why he's here, etc. etc. He explained that \"this aint no fuckin' Quiznos\" and gave us some suggestions as we were standing agape in front of a colossal pyramid of cheese whiz cans. 

The cheese whiz. I'm not sure if I get it. Isn't this just... Velveeta? Do I really want that on a sandwich? Probably not. But I really didn't have a choice. I told him to make the sandwich the real way. And apparently that meant drizzling that shit all over a pile of meat and putting it on some bread. (And some really good bread at that). It was good.  Although, I'm still thinking the provolone would have been better. I suppose I just never acquired a taste for the stuff. 

+4 stars for the food and hospitality/surliness. -1 star for the just-slightly-too-high prices. All in all, this is one of the better places to eat on Mill."}
{"text":"FREAKING AMAZING!

                               but it more like someone else in town. 

Coreone's is a Genuine Taste of Philly as they make their Rib Eye Steak Sandwiches on Philly's Amoroso's Rolls. I didn't try the soft pretzels but I can tell you they sure LOOK like real Philly Pretzels you'd but off street corners. If your in the mood for dessert they also sell Philly's Famous TastyKakes that everyone knows. The casual place sure makes anyone from Philadelphia fell at home with that old Philadelphia look and all the really interesting iconic Philadelphia Memorabilia all around with a \"Rocky Movie\" playing on one of the TV's. 

I tried a small steak combo. The small is plenty big and at least half the people out there only need a small. The ingredients are right so it passes as a Philly Steak Sandwich. Technically I'd like the sandwich tweaked a little different and the meat and onions less chopped up but it was still a good sandwich. I helped myself to the condiment bar and added HOT CHERRY PEPPERS and a few sweet cherry peppers and they were really good. For me it isn't a Philly Steak unless you have those delicious Cherry Peppers on it. 

 I wasn't a big fan of the onion rings but the fries were good.

My husband had the regular size combo. He ate many more cheese steaks in Philly than I did. He thought it was the best Cheese Steak he had in Arizona so far. I thought the regular size one was enormous and can feed two people. I asked my husband if he would get a small size next time and he said NO WAY. 

They offer other menu items like Philly Style Pizza (I might try next time and tell you if it is)  Chicken Steaks and Hoagies.

For me this really was a  fun \"TASTE of Philadelphia\" and I didn't have to drive down the Schuylkill to get there."}
{"text":"You are not going to get a cheesesteak like from Pat's or Geno's but you will get a Philly style Ribeye Steak sandwich on genuine Philly Rolls. They do offer other items like hoagies, Philadelphia Style Pizza, soft pretzels flown in from Philadelphia and Philly TastyKakes. I did try a steak sandwich from another Corleone's location so I thought this time I'd try a Chicken & Spinach Steak Style sandwich. 

The chicken seemed like what a chicken steak normally taste like but I didn't care for the tasteless small amount of spinach in my sandwich. The lifeless spinach brought the sandwich down for me and is something POPEYE would stay away from. For my taste the sandwich meat, onions, and spinach were over chopped so much you could almost drink the filling threw a straw. However the fries were hot fresh and very fluffy and the condiments were good. They had sweet cherry peppers, mild whole cherry peppers and better quality pickle chips.

The atmosphere was cute but not at all what I was expecting. The restaurant featured Cheeze Whiz everywhere. GIANT Cheeze Whiz Cans hanging from the ceiling and a wall of Cheeze Whiz Cans. I understand the Cheeze Whiz connection to Pat's from Philly but this is whey overdone and cheesy and not Philly to me.

I've been to the Camelback Location of Corleone's and the food might have been about the same but the atmosphere was very authentic, fun and almost museum like. Just for the atmosphere the Camelback Location deserves a higher rating.

A little Taste of Philly.

3 stars is A-OK and still positive and means worth a try!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Awesome thin crust pizza. Friendly, fast, fresh, quality ingredients, clean. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I'm a west coast kid, born and raised, I've never had a \"real\" philly cheesesteak but I can't see it getting much better than Corleone's. I've been a frequent customer for the last 3 years and loved it every time, weather its 2 am after a big night on mill or middle of the afternoon, they fire out great sandwiches.  The down side, as with most things in life, its expensive and not getting cheaper.  When I first went to Corleone's, a #1 combo(philly steak with whiz and onions plus fries and a drink) was about $9 and they had \"2 for Tuesday\" buy any sub get an equal sub for free.   Now a combo is almost $13 and Tuesday's are buy a large get a half free.  The guy thats usually working is hilarious if you get him on a tangent, just be ready for profanity and a few inappropriate jokes.

Delivery is usually an option although if the store is too busy or you live to far away they may not deliver."}
{"text":"Corleone's..I owe you .50 cents and a $3 tip. You and your cheesesteaks are amazing. Thanks again."}
{"text":"They have a wide variety of sandwiches & pizza, the best in my opinion is the original with cheese wiz and onions. You can add peppers for additional charge keep that in mind and if you join their email club you get coupons for $4.99 small combo w fries and drink. They best part about this place is the free pickles slices and banana peppers/ hot peppers, even packets parmesan cheese which i like to sprinkle on my fries . It is a little small inside for seating so if you go during the lunch rush you might be taking it to go & the wait time can be a little long if they are short on help. But over all its worth a try if your in the area, parking can be a troublesome as there is mostly just paid parking at meters or garages."}
{"text":"I'm a Philly girl who is always on the hunt for a great cheese steak!  You'd be surprised how hard it is to find a great sandwich, I mean is there really some great secret in Philly??  I do have to first say that Corleone's is pretty pricey for just a sandwich and a drink if there are no specials.  However, they definitely have the best cheesesteak in Phoenix.  My search still continues but Corleone's is number one in my book so far."}
{"text":"Went to this place because they said they sold Philly Cheesesteaks. I was not impressed. I got charged extra for peppers and onions. Last time I checked that was included in a Philly Cheesesteak. Then I get asked what kind of cheese I want. So I choose but barely any cheese at all. Lackluster cheesesteak at best and not worth the $13 they charged me. Maybe their Pizza is good but I won't be going back to find out."}
{"text":"I had not visted a Corleone's but moved recently & this was close. We went in on a Tuesday Night - & I heard the lady in front of me order the Tues.Special.  1 Reg Size Get 1/2 free - That seems like a plan. This was the BEST Sandwich I have had in years hands down. We shared a order of fries - Hand cut- Crispy and good- The Bread is so good on the Sandwich too. GREAT Deal- and GREAT Food. I'm a Fan (Esp on Tues Night) Yum"}
{"text":"Their thin pizza is just like my favorite back in Portland, OR.  It tastes just like Escape from New York Pizza. When it's right out of the oven, the cheese oozes and the crust melts in your mouth.  I've had their Philly cheesesteak sandwiches before, but I'd go back for their pizza.  The only downside is that it's surrounded by meter parking and I went here because we were at the Tempe Festival of the Arts and the kids were hungry and I saw the \"pizza\" sign.  I'm glad I went here. Another patron in front of me was very excited that they sell Tastykake cupcakes and snacks..."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've ever had. It's boring. No flavor. Would not recommend going there. Took forever to deliver and a plane Jane pizza. Everyone in my family hates it."}
{"text":"Not enough flavor to overcome the immediate guilt upon eating one of those sandwiches.  If I'm going to eat something that is going to shave a few months off my life expectancy I want the experience to be memorable.  And it was salty....like \"Dead Sea\" salty.

Maybe it's because I'm such a Dallas Cowboys fan, but I find the cheesesteak to be among the most overrated of the street foods."}
{"text":"I am in no way an expert on Philly Cheese Steaks. I just happen to know the right people and the ones who have searched out good food. So my friend who lived in Philly for quite a few years had searched out Corleone's and informs me that this Cheese Steak is the closest thing you can find to a genuine Philly Cheese Steak! 

So we went to try it, and my only regret is that I did not find this place sooner! They cook the meat right there for you, so you don't question its freshness! I of course ordered my with Cheese Whiz, which I am kind of embarrassed to say, but I love my Whiz. 

I was informed that what makes this a Philly Cheese Steak is the bread, the way it meltdown to nothing but the crust just enough to keep the meat in. Not sure if that factor went into why this is a sandwich I dream about and I must get my Corleone fix at least one a month! If only it were closer to work! Oh well! Its worth being late!"}
{"text":"Ordered an original with whiz. AMAZING. Every once in a while I stray from my paleo diet to indulge, and it REALLY hit the spot today. *BONUS My order was delivered in 20 minutes, the driver was very nice (and cute too).* I would recommend this spot for anyone craving a philly. Yay! You guys rock!"}
{"text":"Excellent eats, service, and prices - give it a try! This was my first visit so I tried The Original and onion rings. Total cost of meal with drink $15. Ample meat and onion rings. Really tasty and fresh made. Can't speak highly enough of this place. Give them your phone number on first visit for extra 10% off. I can't wait to try their wings!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good, but not at all remarkable. Lunch specials are a good value, and Philly sports memorabilia is fun to peruse. United Mileage Plus dining participation is also a plus.  In the end, there are a plethora of pizza options in the area I like much better."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Corleone's online via Eat24 three times and had similar experiences each time.  I'm not sure why I gave it a second and third chance, but I did.  I even waited until after I ate to let my hunger subside before writing this review.

I placed my order this evening, received the confirmation, and was surprised to see a 45-60 min. wait for delivery.  Considering I ordered two sandwiches, which, at best, take 10 mins. to make, it seems like a long wait, but not unreasonable.  However, tonight, as was the case with my first two orders, it took an hour and a half for my food to be delivered.  When it arrived, the sandwiches were cold and a bit soggy.  Not surprising given the fact that they were likely sitting in the restaurant for an hour and 20 mins.  Each time, they've claimed to be shorthanded with delivery drivers that night.  But 3/3 times over a period of months?  It may be time to hire more delivery drivers.  

Avoid this place (for delivery, at least) unless you want to wait until the point of hanger and then eat cold, soggy sandwiches."}
{"text":"For a phlilly cheese steak place to use canned mushrooms and charge u 50 cents for them is crazy .... no one here had a smile on their face it seemed as if everyone here was pissed off to serve me and take my order never coming here again..."}
{"text":"I love love love the food- thank goodness I don't live close anymore- I could gain a lot of weight :) It's perfect for a casual night out on Mill Ave. It is not a formal date place but still has a good atmosphere. Personally, it is only a once in a blue moon things nowadays because it's just too expensive..."}
{"text":"Management still honored my coupon for a small combo even though I was hungry for the large. Always great service and very efficient when picking up dinner to take home after work."}
{"text":"The most amazing Philly sandy in town. They are so good. From what they tell me they're original. A \"Rocky\" movie is always on along with sports. The pizza looks amazing. I'm trying to pry my hands off my Philly to have a slice. Bomb!"}
{"text":"Great Cheese Steak? Hardly, try to sell this is Philly and you would have customers out the door in a heartbeat. First, a cheese-steak need to have substantial roll. This one sogged out, they should use the real thing which is available through Sysco. An Amoroso's roll can stand up to all the juice. Second, this wasn't prime rib-eye, I don't know what cut it was, but is was tasteless. So was the rubbery provolone cheese. And last, it wasn't CLEAN. 
Order the rolls on-line and get your butcher to slice you some rib-eye, homemade is better than anything I've gotten in Phoenix in years."}
{"text":"Amazing every time I come here! My sandwich and fries are always hot and the employees always have a smile on their face! Thank you for continuously making great food!"}
{"text":"Always amazing food and quick service! The guys here are continuously polite. Make sure you get a side of whiz for your fries!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible but the food was good. The guy who waited on us was not very nice. He seemed as if he didn't want us to eat there but we did anyway! :-) I probably won't eat there again. Oh well..."}
{"text":"Done with this place for good. I don't know why I keep giving it a second, third, fourth and fifth chance. Sometimes I get desperate when I can't drive anywhere. Hour and a half to deliver a soggy sandwich, soggy fries, and the driver forgot my drink too. I don't think I'll get this desperate again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love this place and I order delivery from there at least 3 times a week. My most favorite place on earth."}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews on Yelp. The place was spotless, and I am a snob when it comes to a place having dirty tables, chairs and floor. I will turn around and leave before I will eat someplace that I doubt the cleanliness. After all, if the front is dirty, the kitchen must be a mess. 

The food is ah-mazing!!! We have never had a bad meal here. Don't miss the philly steak sandwich with cheese whiz! I would eat that EVERY night if I could!"}
{"text":"good Philly, nice thin pizza w/oregano ... place is kinda dirty, tables were not bussed, but food's good, I'll go back"}
{"text":"I really love the Cheese steaks here.  Always try and make my way here when I'm in the Tempe area.  I recommended this place to a friend and her family that she was visiting and her Uncle wanted to know if he could eat here for breakfast.  hahha.  Good place, solid food.  Will be back."}
{"text":"This is not the Corleone's I know and love. The service/food is terrible here. 
They need to step it up or it will be vacant again in no time.
Do not order delivery. Food always shows up cold and you don't know when it will ever come. 
Go to Tempe or the one in north Scottsdale fr the real Corleone's."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in South Philly, the birth place of the cheese steak, hoagies, and all foods that will eventualy clog your arteries, or at the very leat be well worth the self induced heart burn, mmmm. lOCATING this place was literarly a food oasis in the desert, otherwise known as Sun Valley, Tempe, AZ. The owner and his staff were home grown guys that I grew up with in school, not them personaly, but that type of over friendly, a bit rough aruond the edges type. The owneer was so happy to have a guy from Philly eating there that he gave me afew bucks off my meal, which was about as authentic as you are going to get out in taco bell land. No offense Phoenix area people, but you are plagued with Meexican food and spicy SW resturants galore....and believe, you, me, I love those types of foods, but man, byt he time I stumbled upon Corleone's, my looking glass self persona was in full sing,that South Philly persona erupted outof me, similar to the Hulk in a crisis situation!

      The practicality of shelling out $9.00 for a cheese steak is even a bit steep back home in Philly, but in my mind's eye, it was worth the taste of home, under the tripple digit sunshine, no rain fall weather, that Arizona was offerign me last weekend! I do understand there are several other resturant to select from on Mill St is it...? but this place is worth it if you want to taste the real deal from my hometown of Philadelphia. PS. GO PHILLIES!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the small cheese steak with grilled onions. Excellent bread and tasty made to order. I like the doll pickle jar by the sodas. Definitely on my stopping list on camelback."}
{"text":"I'm from Philly and this place is legit!! Whenever we are in Tempe, we always try to grab a real Philly steak! They have Amoroso rolls shipped in, you can't beat this place!"}
{"text":"We had friends in town from out of state and wanted to take them to Corleone's since it was one of our favorite casual restaurants. We were there on July 12, 2010 around 1:30pm or 2:00pm. When we walked in the door, we were given the spiel about how much better Corleone's is than other cheesesteak places. He (the manager) even went as far as to put down the other Corleone's restaurant on 16th street and Camelback in Phoenix that we frequent quite often, like at least weekly sometimes a couple times a week.

Keith (or so he said that was his name), the manager, proceeded to  make cocaine and drug references about the food. Saying that his creation flies out the door like cocaine, good drugs and gold bars. After we stated that we didn't appreciate the drug and cocaine references because we had a 14 year old girl with us, he proceeded to make an inappropriate remark about her looking more \"mature\" than a 14 year old girl. One of us left with the 14 year old and her mother. When asked who the manager was, he told us that he was and tried to shake hands. After refusing to shake his hand and starting to walk out the door, he said and don't ever grace my door again...no problem, we would NEVER go back. It's sad that a person like this can ruin a very good restaurant for more than one location but I am seriously considering never going to another Corleone's since someone like that can be a manager."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! If you're looking for a delicious Philly cheesesteak you will not be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their pizza is amazing! I just wish ordering delivery didn't take an hour or more. I've recommended this place to others multiple times!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever. No credit card machine, no ice, no pizza??? Close the doors already!"}
{"text":"I tried the pizza for the first time today. I had the $4.99 two cheese slice special with a drink. It's a decent value as the slices are quite large. However not much flavor to the sauce or the pizza in general. The crust despite being properly cooked with appropriate browning on the bottom just seemed to lack substance. It seemed to just disappear in my mouth rather than being chewable. It's a decent value for the money, the place was clean and the service was quick enough. I wouldn't go back for the pizza."}
{"text":"I'm going to echo pretty much what everyone else has said. The employees all seemed to have an attitude. Maybe it's a Philly thing and it's a part of their theme...?  

The place is nice, however, half of the tables needed to be cleaned/wiped down from the last customer and it wasn't busy so... what's the excuse?

The food however was awful. I had the wings as did my wife and they were cold and tasted like the kind you buy in the frozen food section at your local supermarket and then heat up in the microwave... At least they would have been hot if I had done it that way. My son had a slice of cheese pizza which was absolutely gross. It looked like it had been sitting for a day and had zero flavor whatsoever in addition to being like cardboard.

Avoid."}
{"text":"I should have listened to the other horrible reviews about their slow delivery times. I haven't even received the food yet (1.5 hours and counting), but regardless of how good the food might be, I'm never going to order again.

**Got the food after 1 hour and 45 minutes. Cold and mediocre. Never again."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. It was SO dirty when we sat down. Looking around, we saw trash on the floor, dirty tables (we literally couldn't find a clean one), a dirty food/drink station...it was bad. The worst part about it was all the employees were just hanging out in the back and we had to holler at them to get someone's attention to help us with something after we ordered. Besides us, there was only one other family eating there....so it wasn't like it was busy because of a lunch or dinner rush and the employees were doing other things. It was dead. And they weren't at all concerned about their two groups of customers or the cleanliness of their dining room. Makes me wonder what the food prep station looks like...
The food is overpriced for what it is. Paying 50 cents for each pizza topping adds up and I was so grossed out that my mushrooms were canned mushrooms, not fresh. I would have sent it back but we just wanted to get out of there. 
We will not be going back there. You're better off going to any of the other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Ok so for all those that have never had a real Philly Cheesesteak, understand your negative reviews do not equal to those that have grown up in Philly. Not only do they have cheese whiz but the meat is premium and we all know the cheesesteak is all about the bread. Also when you get one to go and the grease is coming out the bag, you know you are in for a treat. If you want one of the best cheesesteaks in Arizona then you need to come down and ask for a cheese wit. Trust me when I say you will not find another better in this state, or any other state for that matter. Also when you walk in and hear all the east coast accents you know they know what they are doing. Even though some of the guys are Giants fans . FLY EAGLES FLY"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza! Maybe it's the Philly theme, maybe it's the good pizza & cheese steaks! Either way it brings my heart right home to Philly even miles away! Thanks for the good food & service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered this via yelp delivery. I'm not sure whether that has something to do with the food we got but I'm not pleased. We ordered 2 sandwiches: the steak Italiano and the buffalo chicken. The first came without the onions I ordered and the second came without the ranch I ordered (it was literally just bread and chicken). I even went as far as requesting both the onions and the ranch on the side. What we got was extremely mediocre sandwiches. I gave 2 starts because it was food and it the sandwiches were eatable.  

The french fries were cold, soggy and tasted like freezer burn. They were not accompanied by any ketchup to make them even minimally palatable. They went straight into the trash bin. 

This 'meal' took a full hour to arrive (which yelp did warn us about). In short: I do not think it would be worth the gas or effort to drive to this place to get food, and its not worth a 60 min wait for delivery."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the service.  I take co-workers there all the time.  Hate the parking at lunch time."}
{"text":"It literally feels like you've crossed into Philly when you step through the door. The employees seem to have been flown in from that region of the country and the look of the place, it's theme, is very obviously designed to have that appearance. It's also about the only place in town I can think of to grab a cheesesteak, especially since the one in Tempe disappeared, and they're good cheesesteaks. I recommend going on a Tuesday, when they run their BOGO deal - then you can try one of their less traditional cheesesteaks, like the pizza one, which is worth a try."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for ZERO stars.  I came here one late night after a night out in Tempe.  We went to Corleone's for two reasons - 1, we were hungry and 2, we needed to use the restroom badly.  As one of the few open places in the area, it seemed like a good plan.  However, after ordering our mediocre sandwiches, which we waited over 15 minutes for, we were told the bathroom is closed at night, even for the employees!

What kind of establishment is allowed to be open, serving food, and does not even have a restroom?

I think they should be shutdown."}
{"text":"These wise guys really know how to make Philly Cheesesteak.
OK, I have been to South Philly and all the way to 9th and Passyunk Ave. That is where the Philly started and Geno's and Pat's are still contending.
   The secret is in the bun and the meat.
As a Philly purist, I always want provolone cheese on mine.
In Phoenix, Cheez Whiz is the main option.
This joint wants to charge extra for green peppers, in Philly they come standard.
    Our two Philly Cheesesteaks were great despite their use of Cheez
Whiz. This is a good choice in Phoenix for Cheesesteaks.
   The French fries were just average. That means my fav Five Guys still make the best fries.
  This place is busy on weekend evenings. Get there early for your PHX Philly."}
{"text":"I had dinner tonight and it was the most amazing cheesesteak I've had in my life. I got a small size classic with cheese whiz, American, and bacon OMG I inhaled it. The steak was lean and flavorful, the bread was fresh and delectable, and the cheese/bacon combo completed my life. 

Thank you for an amazing meal, I'm already looking forward to my next one!!!"}
{"text":"The Cheese steak was ok.  Just ok really because they toasted the damn roll.  That is not a cheese steak , that is a grinder.  The pretzels are really really good and authentic.   As far as the staff, if they are rude or whatever, that is the way it is in Philly.  lol."}
{"text":"Good cheesesteaks, in my opinion they need to come with more cheese. I am always forced to buy extra cheese so I can get it just right which kinda stinks, but when I'm craving a Philly Cheesesteak this is my go-to. I can't say it's just like the ones in Philly, their meat has more flavor, but this is definitely good for Phoenix and probably the best I've found in AZ. You also can't go wrong with their cheese fries, just know if you get them to go they're going to be real soggy so eat them in house while they're fresh. If you've never had a  Philly Cheesesteak before go check it out! Get the cheese wiz wit onions!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Went up today to get a hoagie, and found a note on the door that said sorry but we are closed. Thank you to loyal patrons and thanks for a great 10 years on Mill Ave. Don't waste your time going to this location as they are no longer open but I did travel all the way up to Scottsdale to another location!"}
{"text":"Since we came back from Italy we haven't found pizza decent enough compared to the real thing but This place comes close. Their french fries are also good! And they are quick"}
{"text":"I had noticed a new place had opened in the corner of the mall on the Northeast corner of the mall at Shea and Tatum.  It is interesting, I have lived in the neighborhood for ten years and have noticed a decade of transition for restaurateurs in one corner of the mall behind Z Teja and Paradise Bakery.  Most of the restaurants only stay for a number of months and are out.......................

I believe that Corleone's has staying power.  I decided to try it out yesterday and had a terrific Philly cheese steak sandwich (made with Mozzarella as an option!).  The fries were high end typical restaurant fries - tasty!  They also serve pizza, salads, sandwiches, etc.

The atmosphere was somewhat kitschy with a Philadelphia tie in.  The big cheese whiz cans attached from the ceiling brought a smile to my face.

The food was really quite good.  The staff was friendly and the atmosphere is great for kids as well as adults.  The music was loud (maybe too loud for some), but overall I am grateful that I can have a great pizza and sandwich at a reasonable price (since my former favorite neighborhood restaurant took a slight dive in taste and subsequent ratings).

See you again tonight for the $9.99 - 18\" pizza."}
{"text":"I'm always on a mission to find a great philly cheesesteak. No luck in years. Closest I came to a good one was at a pub in Scottsdale called Clancy's. 

The steak had no flavor and tasted waterlogged. Putting cheese whiz didn't add as much flavor as a real cheese would have. 

Bacon and cheese fries were also a disappointment. They were lacking substance and all the cheese melted and stuck to the bottom of the plate. 

I ordered through grubhub and the service was okay. They were punctual and friendly, but that about all they had going for them. 

I had high hopes for this restaurant and they fell short. More power to them for being in business for so long."}
{"text":"I like this place, it's got good food that tastes authentic....or well, at least what I would think authentic would taste like. Their Philly Cheesesteak sandwich is really good and their fries are also quite tasty.

So why, you might ask, am I only giving it 3 stars? A couple reasons:
 - Although it is a good sandwich, I think it is overpriced. If you want to get a sandwich combo, you're going to walk out paying 13 dollars.
- The staff isn't particularly nice..they're not mean, but I wouldn't say they are nice.
- And not that they did this on purpose, but I walked in and used a coupon once (which wasn't that great of a deal), ordered food, sat down, and saw a sign offering a special for that day that was WAY better than my coupon. I really wish the guy who rung me up (who might have been the owner) had mentioned it.

Conclusion: This place isn't bad and some people may feel it's 4-5 star good, I just don't feel it's worth the price."}
{"text":"Cheese steaks sandwich with cheese wiz is really good. But my only gripe is that for a giant cheese steak sandwich combo is a little exp"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, it is the service that gets the one star. The food is absolutely spectacular and I love it. However, when I last ordered delivery the order took 2 hours, which for the quality of the food I didn't mind. It was the driver who decided to attempt to enter our locked facility at my work. When corrected that he is to drop the food off at the front desk he stated that he was \"too busy\". 

I had emailed the appropriate staff regarding the poor delivery service over a week ago and have yet to hear anything.

So disappointed, for that is the reason I will no longer be dining or ordering from them."}
{"text":"With the Eagles playing today and being married to a philly native we were destined to eat a cheese steak today! Must be good luck.. right?! This was my first time to Corleone's. I never felt so stupid till I try to order... wiz, wit, witout, with what!??? Lol I just look at my husband like please just order for me, it's cool. Haha I got it down now though so next visit I'll be a big girl.

I got the original philly cheese steak wit onions, green peppers, wiz, and toasted. HOLY AMAZINGNESS! The wiz was creamy and delicious, the meat was tender, and bread had the perfect crunch with being toasted. I might even get extra wiz next time. We also got the buffalo chicken with ranch and mozzarella. It's was very good yet super messy. Not too Spicy. We each got a combo with regular fries and cheese fries. The fries are super good and have the perfect crisp. The cheese fries were amazing!

Few tips I learned today:
1. Get extra wiz so it's layered on top.. mmmm
2. Toasted bread
3. Cheese fries. Yum!
4. Add grilled green peppers

They do have a pickled pepper bar to add to your sandwich in addition if you like that. I'm not crazy about those sweet papers but my husband likes them. 

Overall everything was very tasty and I'm excited to come back. Friendly and quick service. I really liked the philly/eagle decor in this shop. Makes you really feel like your back in philly with the atmosphere and food. You know your married to a philly guy when their 20reasons your from philly sign all applies to my husband and his family. Haha! Now for the game today.... Go Eagles!!!"}
{"text":"Midweek...don't wanna cook...don't wanna drive...who delivers?? CORLEONE'S!! The delivery person was a sweetheart which is the equivalent of having a pleasant waiter/waitress to start your meal experience. It sets the mood and expectations and well...it was yummy! 

If you order the cheese fries, make sure you eat those first since cheez wiz has a limited time frame for being fresh and hot. Once it chills, you end up with...well...goop. I love their cheesesteak sandwiches, this time the fries were a little overdone but still not too bad. 

For a $20 we ordered a couple of cheesesteak sandwiches and split a cheese fry, just enough food and it doesn't break the bank. Not bad for delivery!"}
{"text":"$13 for a bland, large cheesesteak. $13 for a bland, large cheesesteak with 5 pieces of mushrooms that we paid extra for. $13 for a bland, large cheesesteak that we ordered with fries -- we got about 10 pieces for that $3.

Absolute and utter rip off. Semi-friendly cashier who seemed hell bent on rushing us through our order even though there was NO ONE BEHIND US.

If I could give this place zero stars and burn it down in the process, I would. It was shiteous. Absolutely shiteous.

Am I making myself clear? I think I am."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the bad reviews. I have eaten at the Camelback location twice and the Mill location about five times. Every time it is great. The bread is so good! Soft, tasty, etc. The meat is so flavorful and juicy! Every time it is good! I always get the original. I have eaten at Forefathers once, and I prefer Corleone's! Much more flavorful! My Sister disagrees, but my Husband agrees. I recommend Corleone's! It is the best Philly I have had! 

Oh, I almost forgot, the service! The service is amazing at Camelback, free extra cheese, etc.  The manager there is so friendly! The service at Mill has been hit and miss.

I gave five stars because it is the best I have had, but I have never been to the city to have the real thing, so I can not compare."}

The servers were so nice, they visited and brought a water gun for my nephew.  Great food, really nice people, five stars!"}

{"text":"Been hearing all the buzz about Corleone's Philly Sammies here at work, and was told by a coworker to goto their website & sign up for their fan club, and I did and got a free small sandwich! Hot Damn!! That makes this place all right with me!! I do love the free stuff.  I checked out their menu and decided on the Little Joey's Cheesteak Hoagie with grilled onions and mozzarella cheese!  I did get a little harassment for picking the Joey, but hey I got a lil Joe in my life that I'm very fond of, so why not go with a good thing right! The sandwich was delish!! The steak was tender the bread was firm yet not tough to bite. I think if Im every in the mood for a philly sammie I will be back & will try with Philly Cheesteak! Love finding new lunch spots!"}
{"text":"Just had the experience of a lifetime with my reading class.On this field trip, my students got to work the grill, creating their own cheesesteaks. They are still raving about the opportunity and the food. Everyone in our party was also treated to their own, cooked-to-order sandwich. Little Joey is the best!"}
{"text":"Slow service and 15-20 for mediocre philly cheese steaks.  Sandwiches and fries do not have a lot of flavor.  Also the televisions are blaring loud, if you have sensitive hearing beware.  Seating is limited."}
{"text":"Ex-East-Coaster that I am, I am always looking for a good traditional pizza and a Philly Cheesesteak. 5 stars for the pizza here - just like I used to have growing up. 3 stars for the cheesesteaks -- good but not great, and a bit overpriced. I prefer Uncle Sam's, just up the 51 a bit, but I suppose that's just personal preference. Service is solid; last time I came in for take-out they burned my pizza, so they made me a new one for free. That's how you treat customers."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery. The estimated wait time was 45-60 minutes (a bit long for delivery imo) and they were 15 minutes late. The french fries were soggy and tasted a bit stale. Even re-heated, they weren't good. However, the sandwich made up for everything. I had the meatball marinara sub with provolone and jalapenos and it was delicious. I'd be willing to try this place again, but not through delivery again. Carry out only."}
{"text":"Great Philly style pizza!

Watch out for homeless coming in and asking for a piece!"}
{"text":"Great cheesesteaks sandwich. I always love a cheesesteak but I hate getting fatty meat so I'm picky about where I get them, not one bit of fat in my sandwich here. Oh yeah,  I love the wiz on my philly. My girlfriend got two slices of pizza and loved it.  After 4 pm the have a large cheese pizza for 8.99. We got one a few days later and we got it well done and it was delicious. The staff is nice a friendly and pointed me in the right direction after asking a few ?'s. They deliver but of course Im a about a mile out of range but I thought I would mention it. Ill be back."}
{"text":"love that the offer delivery! the cheese steaks are always amazing & staff is friendly. The delivery service is just as good as going inside!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this local for about 10 yrs. It's gone downhill. It stinks when you walk in. While standing there waiting to order . A roach came around the pizza continued across walk way and up the wall. We told the guy running the place. He came out and killed it with a towel.  Loss my appetite for this place from now on. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Went to the Mill Ave location and ordered the Philly Cheesesteak with wiz.  It was greasy, oily, fatty, and absolutely perfect.   I'd probably die of a heart attack if I ate it every day, but I was in town for only one night and had it both for dinner the first  night and for lunch the next day.  I will have to work hard to keep myself away from it when I return to Phoenix.

Oh, and I should mention that the guy who appeared to be the manager was very friendly and cordial.  These small things make a difference to me.  Also, although others have felt the price was a bit high, I cannot complain about paying $10 and being fully satisfied."}
{"text":"we went on Sunday around 7, they were not busy.  They were freindly and we enjoyed the food. got 3 cheeseteaks and cheese sauce for fries. Sandwich rolls were great, cheese was wizz-y, and service wasn't slow at all.  
We drove 29 miles form Goodyear to go and weren't disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the customer service is horrible they have never deliver the right order in the four times that I've attempted to try this place"}
{"text":"I've had there pepperoni pizza a couple of times now when they were doing $9.99 pizza specials.  The pizza is A-OK for the price but takes forever to come out.  I have yet to try a cheese steak here and will update my rating after I give it a try.  Guy behind the counter was really confused or extremely hungover  when I came in for an early lunch."}
{"text":"Food here is pretty good-does remind me of back home.The pizza is seemingly cooked in brick oven and you can tell its made with fresh dough, good mozzerella cheese, etc..I really like their cheese fries also. Problem is as others have noted expect like 2 hours for delivery. Kind of ridic, if they can get service up to food level place would be a hit!"}
{"text":"Eh.

I can't speak to their cheeseteaks, as I've only ever ordered pizza (always delivery, through GrubHub). The delivery times have always been accurate for me, and the food arrives pretty hot.

Their pizza is pretty basic. No this really flashy or high quality, just pizza for pizza's sake.

I found it odd, and kinda gross, that when I ordered bell peppers and onion on my pizza, it came with the same cooked-on-the-flat-top, limp and overcooked peppers and onions that would come on a cheeseteak sandwich. Does anyone else find this unusual? I get trying to save time and/or money by topping pizzas with their already-prepared veggies, but come on. Any place serving respectable pizza should have raw, fresh peppers and onions to top their pizzas, IMHO.

That said, their sauce is pretty good and the crust ain't bad. Pizza probably better suited to accompany some beers, and nothing you'd go out of your way for."}
{"text":"i tried the philly original and it was just okay.  all i tasted was salt.  i ordered fries too and those were covered in salt too.

in my opinion it seemed pricey for the quality of food.

the service seemed good and exciting."}
{"text":"Ah, this place only gets 3 stars.....it would get more but...read on:

1.  This is a great spot to eat after last call...packed, but damn it's good.  
2.  Always get it with Whiz....duh.
3.  Fries aren't half bad
4.  Be ready to cough up $10-12 for a sandwhich, fries, and a drink.

Okay...really....10-12 to eat at this place??????  Rip-off.  That' s my biggest complaint.  It would be different if the food was amazing or it was overflowing with meat....but it's neither of those things."}
{"text":"The food is oversold but the price is right and the staff is nice. 60% of me going back. just because I l live in the area. 4 stars."}
{"text":"I'm all about the $5 special. Two slices (I stick all sorts of free peppers on them, can you say cheapo?) and a drink! The guys at the counter are kind even though they're usually super busy. You can get a large for like $10 too. Good sauce & great crisp crust- I'm in!"}
{"text":"This was a surprisingly good meal. I mean the taste and flavors far exceeded any expectations we may have had going in. Especially the fries which are just amazing. The buffalo chicken is a bit spicy but was devoured nonetheless. The Philly is made from rib eye steak and it's obvious they use quality meat. I ordered mine with grilled onions, mushrooms, bell peppers and cheese. So good. The small was a generous portion.  We also ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza and that was delicious, too, although it was a tad on the greasy side.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Can you say....Philly Cheese Steak?

This place has the most authentic cheese steaks that I have found so far in the Phoenix Valley."}
{"text":"What a mess...at noon on a Sunday, they were out of dough (no pizza!?), two of the employees were clueless about the menu and unfriendly, and when we chose the already made cheese pizza slices under the heatlamp, we had to wait 10 minutes for them to be heated up.

All that aside, the pizza was not good -- tasteless sauce, greasy cheap cheese, and chewy floppy crust. Just not good. I'd skip it, even though I would typically eat any pizza any time."}
{"text":"For a chicken cheese steak, a cold italian sub (hoagie), or a slice of great thin-crust pizza, this is my destination.  
They also usually have Tastykakes...from Philly....but don't tell, or they might run out!"}
{"text":"1 star because you can't give anything less. I've ordered four damn sandwiches from this place with the request of no onions and they continue to put onions on it. Every. Fucking. Time. Please hire people who can read a ticket properly"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: the only other Philly cheesesteaks I've ever had were at sporting events, carnivals or airport/shopping mall stands.
That being said, I was invited to Corleone's and was told I had to try the Cheesesteak since I never had an authentic one. I was not disappointed.
I ordered it 'onions and whiz wit' despite the fact that I usually like really good cheese. I am a HUGE fan of what I ate. The steak is really good rib eye; not some cheap, fatty mystery piece of cow. That's why you're paying so much for the sandwich. There is a row of condiments that include oregano and red pepper flake shakers and peppers in vinegar. I added those to my sandwich too.
The bread is fluffy and tender; easy to bite through. The meat is choppeed just right; it's tender and juicy. The Cheez Wiz... well, it's just good stuff in this sandwich. I never thought I'd say that, but if you haven't had it wiz wit, you gotta try it that way. You won't be disappointed.

The whole sandwich is an enormous order, but because I splurge on foods like this so rarely, I get the whole thing when I do.
Like others said, I think the price is a little high, but man, I love these sandwiches."}
{"text":"Best Philly cheesesteak in the valley.  You can get cheez whiz on it and they use sliced ribeye.  Most places do not offer cheez whiz, which every place in Philly ofers....Can't get closer to Philly than that!  Go!  Now!"}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak in town.   Get cheese whiz sauce with your fries.  Service is fast and friendly decor is a philly history lesson.  Five stars."}
{"text":"Craving kicked in...!  Drove 30minutes, walk in & they proceed to tell me that they will be right with me... Ok, no problem... THEN, I place my order just for them to proceed to tell me they are out of bread AND they ran out of bread 30minutes ago (which would have been two hours prior to close).  Would you not have shared that with me right when I walked in...?

Regardless of the fact that there are two grocery stores within walking distance where you could have purchased bread...

Just sad!

I understand the bread is a factor, but really?!?!?!?!?!?!  
Unfortunate managing.... Yet you will still maintain business, though I'll go to a different store in the future........"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm a dude that likes meat and cheese, so, hey, sandwich with meat and cheese should be pretty awesome, right?  I love Chicago-style Italian Beef, and this is kinda similar components.  

So why is the Italian Beef so delicious and the Philly Cheesesteak so repugnant?  

Wiz.

Blech, blech, blech, blech.  

Whoever invented Cheez Wiz needs to be punched right in the balls and made to refund the $10 it cost for this sandwich."}
{"text":"We wanted pizza and wings delivered at 11:00. We were told they started delivering at 11:00 but would do the best they could. 11;03.....hot pizza and wings at our office.  And both were delicious!   They were super helpful and nice.  Our new go to pizza place for the office!"}
{"text":"I went to eat here once...wasn't super impressed with the place or the cheesesteak, I have never been to Philly to have one, but this wasn't great. The meat is kinda bland and stringy and the bread was OK.

These guys show up at my job every once in a while to give out free samples. They should probably think that through though...their samples aren't very good.

I did see a porn video that was shot with them in the background once though. (It was an 'on-the-street flashing' video."}
{"text":"this was a pretty damn good food joint here.  honestly.  and instead of all caps, i'll do my review with no caps at all

* first of all, damn good meatball sub. 
i spent 40 minutes in traffic on the 202, had enough, re-routed, ordered a meatball parm, shut down for a break.  the good news is, good meatball, good sauce, really good bread.  No, really pretty good.  I give it a 6.2...noticeably better than Subway. 

because you really don't know how mediocre Subway bread is, and it's not bad, but you don't really know how mediocre it is until you eat better bread.  this is better bread.  not bianco bread, but better;

* the bad news is, there's no parm on this sandwich.  in fact, i'd be willing bet there's no \"parm\" anywhere near this joint.  define parm, buddy.  and if it's a meatball parm, that parm would be short for parmesan and there wasn't a shred of parm-E-San, it's not really a meatball PARM.  PLEASE DON'T ASK ME ABOUT THE WONDERS OF CHEESE-WIZ, 70% if their business. 

* I asked for a side of sauce and was disappointed when it was given cold-how does that make sense?  why would i want cold marinara on what is supposed to be a pipping-hot sandwich? MAKES NO SENSE.

the friendly guy behind the line, kinda young, ball cap, thank you.  you were helpful, friendly, thank you.  the other guy?  older, facial hair...can i say f-you, you f-ing a$$?  what are you doing in the service business when clearly you hate customers?;

* THE SIDE STUFF: SWEET PEPPERS/SPORT PEPPERS ARE FRIGGING EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (Far back of the restaurant) SERIOUSLY.  Hot, sour, sweet, 

let me summarize this: 
GIVEN: the meatball parm i got this day, the better-than-average-bread, along with these side peppers, the overall taste, flavor (same?) and price, I would go back.  Yes. now, lets discuss the Tuesday special:
my Regular meatball parm, like, $8.00, on a Tuesday, after 4pm, I got any other sandwich same size for free.  See My Receipt!!!!

Again, this is a good sandwich, great price for the area or not, I'm gonna go back.  just gonna avoid the guy cooking anger than me."}
{"text":"Upon my first visit to Corleone's (On Mill Ave),  I asked the cashier what to order. He told me to get the regular cheese-steak \"wit wiz\" and onions. I was skeptical about the 'wiz' but I shouldn't have been!! My cheese-steak was absolutely delish!! The wiz melted perfectly over the freshly cooked meat/onions, and that concoction nestled perfectly in a fresh bun! Also, the crispy/flavorful fries complimented my sandwich perfectly. I wouldn't order take-out (for fear of soggy-bun-syndrome) but I will definitely go back to Corleones anytime I get that craving for an amazing cheese-steak and casual/fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you like hamburger helper, order yourself a Philly steak with cheez whizz. Not only did my sandwich take an hour and a half to be delivered a fifth of a mile, it's contents were no better than re-heated, leftover hamburger helper mush. DINE-IN"}
{"text":"Good sandwich, nice staff, and the fries were divine! I'd go back to AZ just for those!"}
{"text":"Without the Channel 15 Smart Shopper card I would have given a 2 star review. Was hoping for a \"Take Me Back\" cheese steak and it was alright at best. Over cooked, stingy on the cheese whiz (all on the bun and none on the steak). If you are a pepper head, you will like the pepper bar.  Think there were 4 maybe 5 types of peppers. Our sandwiches were dry and just barley worth the 2 for one Thursday Smart Card price."}
{"text":"Love this Corleones location. Always go for hot wings and a slice of pizza. The staff is friendly and funny, and really make the place feel like an authentic Philly restaurant. I've had the \"Original\" whiz sandwich and love that too, just a lot of food! Also great for a quality and speedy delivery if you don't want to leave the couch!"}
{"text":"Cheese Steaks!  That's what they do ... place looks like a bar (but no liquor offered) ... very clean ... very nice ... GREAT Cheese Steaks ... with Cheese Wiz and the buns rock!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 10 pizzas for delivery for a special event only 4 blocks from Corleones.  After 1 hour past delivery time and 3 phone calls, went to restaurant and picked up the pizzas.  Was told a variety of stories during the 3 calls, all misleading.

Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff.  Get the #1-the original and don't forget the onions and the whiz!  Employees were personable.  Food was fast and hot.  Nice, casual setting."}
{"text":"YES.  

This is exactly what I was hoping for.  Just cheesy enough, just beefy enough, just greasy enough, just awesome enough.  (got the cheesesteak if it wasn't obvious)

Not mind-blowing, but that's kind of the goal, right?  Bread, wiz, steak and onions.  Exactly what the doctor ordered.  

Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I was really starting to love this place and was ordering at least 2 times a week until last week! I place an order for a regular size sandwich.Normally I pay $11 for a combo and this time the bill was $9.00 I was surprised but didnt think too much of it since after the tip it was $11.00 I open my sandwich and I have a HALF of a sandwich. I was so disapointed I called back and he said thats what i ordered and he would send me another half if i was hungry. I m not paying for a whole other sandwich. I was so disapointed that i paid $11 for half of a sandwich. I wont be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Spent $40 on a large pizza wings and a vegetarian sandwich, pizza was mediocre Wings were overly cooked so they were hard, the sandwich had provolone cheese lettuce tomato bell peppers and soggy spinach and it taste like nothing worse sandwich I think I've ever had! Would definitely never eat there again"}
{"text":"This is review is based on my experience with their delivery service. After several orders of pizza and wings, I have not been disappointed! I love this style of pizza- thin crust, light on the sauce, powerful cheese taste. The wings were yummy as well. Only complaint is that it took a while to get the food (longer than I was told on the phone) and the second time it arrived less than lukewarm."}
{"text":"After trying several cheese steaks in the area we found no need to continue our search the perfect, authentic \"wit whiz\" sandwich. By far the best this side of the continent"}
{"text":"Corleone's is good. My favorite is the Chicken Italiano, but sometimes the chicken is too dry. The Original is great too. I like mine with provolone instead of whiz. Both the steak and chicken are lean and sliced thin. The staff is nice and helpful, but the prices are outrageous. Your receipt does usually have a coupon for $2 off your next order, but still...$9 for a half sandwich, fries & drink is a little much. The fries, though! Oh the fries...they are yummy!"}
{"text":"We need 1/2 stars on Yelp cuz I want to do a few extra points for the fact that these guys are from Northeast Philly and are proud of it.  They put it down on Mill Ave daily and they are actually worth the stop here out West.  If you know how to order, you can get the perfect replica of the masterpiece that Philly is known for and be assured that it is the genuine article.
Now if that makes sense... you might be the one to sling wiz on a perfectly good sandwich deserving All White American!  I like mine with fried onions, banana peppers, mustard, mayo, and a wee bit of ketchup too!

Plus they have Tastykakes every once in a while."}
{"text":"Will NEVER be back.  Apparently rudeness is acceptable service.  My friend went in to pick up our pizza, watched the pizza jockey pull and stretch a pie trying to get it of the board and into the oven.  When the cashier was asked if that was our pizza, my friend was told \"I'm not gonna tell you that\" and refused to answer direct questions.  I guess they have enough business that they don't need my business now or in the future."}
{"text":"love these sandwiches. its a little pricey if you order 'normally' but there are all sorts of specials to help with that-get on their email list!. when you can bring that price down, what you get is one of the better sandwiches from a chain around. the pizza is ok, nothing mindblowing, but still better than the likes of Dominoes or Papa Johns. same deal as the sandwiches- if you order at the right time, you can get a lot of pie for your dollars (and if you are inebriated and/or have lots of hot sauce, you will like it just fine!)"}
{"text":"Great pizza, cool place to chill out and catch a game til the sun goes down."}
{"text":"I ended up here on a recent Friday by accident.  My first stop for cheesesteaks is now closed (apparently for awhile) so I was kind of rudderless.  Drove around for a bit until I saw Corleone's, and since I was in a cheesesteak mood, headed on it (it also helped that a sporting event that I wanted to see was on at the time and I knew they had tv's).   I'd also been to the Corleone's in Scottsdale in the past, and had remembered liking it.

I ordered the large philly (whiz witout) and no fries (though from the past, the cheesefries are great) since as a general rule (which failed this time), it's usually best to save the stomach room for the cheesesteak, rather than add on the fries. The food came out in a suitable amount of time, and I didn't think I was deliberate in eating it...however towards the last 1/4 of the sandwich, the meat/cheese was already getting cold, it was kind of weird.  Anywho, I ate the whole thing (note:  $10 is probably a little pricey, I think they must know this, as I got two coupons from them while there, one for $2 off next time, one for BOGOF).  

Fast forward a few hours later, and I'm at my desk with food baby from stuffing myself.  Stupid me for eating so much was my initial thought.  Except that my tummy was unsettled for the next two days.  Now...I can't say for sure that it was Corleone's...but I'm pretty sure, so not too pleased about that.  I mean, if the sandwich had been good, it totally would have been worth it, but it was ok, and not a great value.  Not sure if I'll be back.  2.5 stars, only rounded up because my prior experiences in Scottsdale were better than here."}
{"text":"Holy Moley.

Stumbled into Corleone's status post St. Patrick's Day partying and knew I had to order a philly wit whiz. I mean, what other restaurant offers cheeze whiz? Flavor was spot on, meat was fresh off the grill, hot and welcomed into the perfectly toasted bun. The cheeze whiz was just the cherry on top. The fries were... mehhh. Unimpressive.

The line went out the door as the smell of cheesesteak wafted down Mill. I'm glad someone pushed me into this dive. I'll be back for Wiz + Pepperoncinis the next time I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"Had a small cheesesteak with America cheese and onion and peppers, was really good and actually a pretty good size. I wish it would've had a bit more pepper but if I ever want a cheesesteak this is where I'll be going! Fast service thought it was a little hot in there so take out would be your best option looks small but once you step inside its big."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was good, atmosphere was cool...very casual.  I ordered a steak sandwich wit cheese and onions.  This is the way its supposed to come (I don't know because I never have been to Philly but that is what they said).  I thought the sandwich was fantastic!  I wish there was a little more meat but the flavor was great, fries were great and it was worth stopping.  Not sure about the experiences with the other Yelpers but I did watch a show on a famous Philly place and they had attitude so maybe its the way it but I did not experience it."}
{"text":"The staff here is great! I have been here a few times and usually get the cheese steak with provolone cheese and it's wonderful! I recently went in and tried the Italian hoagie and I personally did not like it all that much. Honestly, I made a few modifications to it which might be why I didn't enjoy it as much. This is one of the only places in Phoenix I will go to for a philly cheese steak."}
{"text":"As a fellow CheeseSteak Lover, I have to try it when I see it on the menu.

Not a fan here.  First, if you want me to come back, Why do you nickel and dime me as a customer?  That's just bad business.  $15 for my meal?  It's fast food!

Anyway, I'll sum it up...  No thanks."}
{"text":"** Insert cliche' Godfather phrase here **

Ok... now that that's out of the way, I have to say that after two visits here to Corleone's, I'm surprisingly a fan. 

Why surprisingly? Mostly because it's a chain and I'm generally opposed to such establishments. However, there's just something I like about this place. The decor and vibe even feels like you're in a little, slightly shady sandwich shop in Philly. Not that I've ever been to Philly, but it's stereotypical of what I would expect it to be like. 

I think one of the Rocky movies has been playing on the one tv each time I've been here. There's a pyramid of Cheez Whiz cans. Philadelphia Eagles stuff, and of course a picture of the namesake Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) on the wall. 

Do they make the best Philly cheesesteak I've had? No. But it is pretty good. The last time I was here I tried a slice of their pizza because it looked fantastic... Lo and Behold it was really good, thin crust deliciousness. One of the better pizza slices I've had in Phoenix, believe it or not. 

To top everything off, the guys that work here have been friendly on both visits.. not bubbly friendly, but cool guy friendly. They welcome you, say goodbye and thank you for coming... but they do it cool... You know what I mean. I think that goes with the Philly atmosphere too.

Overall, if you're in the area and looking for a decent bite to eat, this is a good choice. 

**Insert cliche' Godfather phrase closing statement here**"}
{"text":"Previously ordered from here and was always pleased . Today my order was 20 mins late. My husband had to go out looking for the driver. Then I get the driver was smug about not bro g compensated for his tardiness ... hopefully this is just a fluke"}
{"text":"I'm extremely upset with Corleone's. I waited 2 hours for my delivery order and he didn't have change that I really needed. They lost a loyal customer"}
{"text":"Ordered from here the other day, the cheesesteak with whiz cheese and added mushrooms was ,the fries and pizza was pretty good too. This will be my new take out spot"}
{"text":"This place has cheap pizza by the slice & is open late night.  The pizza tastes okay.

That is all."}
{"text":"We visited Corleone's for the first time tonight because it was 50% off everything when you show your smart shopper card.  We got a large pizza (which can comfortably feed at least four adults) and 1 dozen BBQ wings with 1 dozen mild wings, topped off with a pitcher of Kiltlifter.  They have two beers on tap - Miller and Kiltlifter and four-ish types of bottled beers that are mostly of the Bud Lite variety.  

The pizza was delicious -- large, hot and with a warm crust that was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The chicken wings were good -- I'm not generally a chicken wing person but I loved these.  

The staff were friendly and accessible."}
{"text":"We walked in for a quick bite, asked \"the man\" for his recommendation and he hooked us up with the most delicious Philly Cheesesteak I've ever tried in my life!! 
The decor is interesting and they even had Rocky playing on the television!! 

Definitely plan to come back!"}
{"text":"Needed to add a side of cheese. Since it all melted away by the time it got to me.  Although it was still yummy"}
{"text":"Call Corleone's only if you have two hours for delivery. The online order response told us 50 minutes. Horrible manager on duty. We called. Told us at 60 minutes the driver was in the car. Told us at 110 minutes that driver left 15 minutes ago. One of those has to be a lie, right?  Told us \"Online says it's 50min but really it is 90min.\"  Food arrived 2hrs late. On dot. They never tried to update us or treat us honestly, just kept feeding us lines. Kept calling me \"boss\" which I wish were true. Driver was nice enough and hustled, said he wasn't even a driver but instead a cook. Don't know who to blame. But I know we won't be calling Corleone's again. Or going in person."}
{"text":"Decided to give them another shot.  Family in town and they wanted a cheesesteak.   Ordered at 6:00 I gave up and cancelled at 8:00.  Just left the house for Panda Express.   Someone please tell them to stop their delivery service."}
{"text":"Used to be one of our favorite places to get pizza from. We've been coming here for the last couple years. Not sure what has happened to this place but the last time we ordered they forgot the three sodas that we paid for and said \"we will just add credit to your next tab\". This would've been fine, but then we realized they forgot all of the ranch we ordered. We had a big group of people over so we ordered about 6 ranch. When I called and asked for some ranch to be delivered the guy (I think his name was Joseph B) claimed that we didn't order any and that they were going to be closing (it was only 9:00)...how the hell are we supposed to eat chicken wings without ranch?! And I am positive we ordered extra ranch because I do every time and my friends confirmed that I did. THEN... we ate some of the wings anyways and they were so dry that it tasted like we were biting and chewing pure chicken bone rather than getting any meat at all. It was a really terrible experience and their lack of customer service has pushed me to take my business elsewhere. They can keep the $5 they owe me from their mistake of forgetting our sodas. You couldn't pay me to order from here again!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Philly cheese steaks in the Phoenix metro area. I have one thing to say and that is get it \"whiz wit\" the cheese and onion combination makes it heavenly. The second best thing is their fries which are always crisp and not too greasy. I recommended this a foodie from New York who's husband is from Philly and they both commented that this place is \"legit\"."}
{"text":"I go here about once a month. As far as cheese steaks go they are very good. Get the one with whiz and onions! Here is where I have a problem, the customer service is horrible.  When you walk in they don't greet you. They just look at you and wait for you to say something. They never smile. Everyone working looks like they hate their life. A simple hello, a smile, and a thank you when I give you my hard earned money is all I ask. I hope they improve or I will find another place for cheese steaks."}
{"text":"We really enjoying getting food from here, always great customer service with employees.  The owner needs to improve his customer service, it really sucks."}
{"text":"Damn it feels good to be a gangsta... I heard that song last time I walked in. The guy that made my sandwich kept rubbing snot off his nose and didn't wash his hands. He asked me if I wanted the wiz or if I was a skirt... Can you call a girl a skirt....?.... I went with the wiz wanting to appear like a educated philly girl.  It was gross, really gross. The meat tasted freezer burned and so did the fries.. Slathering the crap in cheese wiz only made it more apparent that I was going to have a heart attack before finishing it. Don't eat here, you'll be sorry.. Your stomach will drop kick you over and over. Cheese Wiz is gross.. They have other things on the menu, like greasy grease sloshed around in cheese, or for a healthier version you can add grease soaked mushrooms and peppers to your cheese soaked brittle bun. Warning - Only skirts do that. When you go to Corleones you wanna be a gangsta. Ok maybe not.. but I did want to cap the bitch that frightened me into ordering the wiz.."}
{"text":"This place is great, from the cheesesteaks to the pizza everything is good! Anyone that is complaining about attitude is clearly not from the east coast nor has ever visited the east coast...go to Philly and see if you don't get a little attitude in a restaurant...I'd be offended if I didn't get my meal with a side of attitude! 

People need to stop being so sensitive..."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Corleone's for years.. Sometimes multiple times a week but my experience today was awful & they lost my business as well as everyone where I work. I ordered my usual Turkey Hoagie to have delivered.. once I received my order I noticed what looked like a dry bloody booger on the bag so I called requesting a refund or a new sandwich. The man gave the phone to another guy who was just plain rude. He said \"oh you're amber, you order here like 3 times a week.. you know as well as I do that it is not a dry bloody booger, it probably came down the food line. I'll come and get it & then hung up\". The delivery driver came & gave me a refund (he was really nice) but was not offered any new food to make up for it. It. Doesn't. Matter. You don't talk to people like that.. especially someone who orders as often as we do."}
{"text":"I ordered online and I chose the incorrect location. When I got here we figured out the issue. The person who was helping us understood the mistake and made my order free of charge. I have been coming to this location for years and everyone has always been very friendly. Great customer service to go along with a bomb ass Philly cheesesteak. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about this restaurant at first.  In fact, I hesitated before going in but every time I have been in (twice), the service has ranged from average to exceptional.  The cheesesteaks are delicious!  I'm a picky eater and I'm difficult to impress."}
{"text":"I first heard about Corleone's on yelp and wanted to try them out, for sure. Looking at their website and prices, you get the idea that it's more of a HighEnd/Gourmet Place than your average place to get Cheesesteaks. Having recently worked in Philly and getting to have Real Philly Cheesesteaks wit the Wiz @ World Famous Geno's, I had high expectations for Corleone's version. 
But, I can't tell you how they rate. I've only had chicken, as I'm trying to cut out redmeat for a bit. The chicken is bomb. I've had both the Buffalo and BBQ wit-out onions, heh. First off, there's a good bit of chicken on these sandwiches. Second Part, the buns are those awesome soft Bolillo rolls. The sandwiches aren't huge for the buck, but I expected that. It doesn't stop me from ordering, at all. Corleone's has definitely worked into \"The Rotation\". 
I've only had delivery, it was the Tempe average 1 hour wait, with the Standard 2 buck drive charge."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a slice of pizza in my case for a hole pie. I love how crunchy and tasty the crust is truly one of a kind, and that sauce is perfect. Don't ask for it plain stop being cheap and add some toppings.   The bbq wings are really good as well."}
{"text":"Always passed by this establishment and wanted to try so today I did just that
The interior could use some renovations/updates... It is just really worn/dated...
The guy who helped take my order was very nice and helpful. I wanted to get one of the sausage subs/sannys but the sausage was not thoughed so I decided on the cheese steak with provolone cheese and fried onions... It was actually pretty good and hot. If I had known about the cheese wiz, I might have gotten that, maybe next time... I also wanted to add some off the yellow peppers but they looked like they had been sitting all day so I passed them... I tossed some crushed red pepper on though and it was good... All in all... The visit was fine... The interior was really the downside... Food was good and service was good... Oh and prices were pretty okay..."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars. They were very rude when I came in on my BIRTHDAY to redeem a free small sandwich. I presented the coupon on my phone which is what it states on the coupon on my phone to do to present to server nothing else. Additionally I was also gonna order a lot of other food for my family. They said it couldn't be redeemed because it had to be printed out to get it free, even though it didn't state that ANYWHERE and it had a bar code and could show my ID that it was my birthday. It should be clearly stated if that is the restaurant policy before people go out of their way to go to that place. They were rude about it and couldn't explain why it wasn't listed or at least put a sign up at the register stating that. They need to work on customer service, both employers had attitude and the girl was rolling her eyes. Make all the promotions very clear before sending them out so your customers are not inconvenienced."}
{"text":"I used to eat at Charley's for the Philly steaks until I tried Corleone's I fell in love with it. Until recently I requested mushrooms on my sub so upon eating the Philly I noticed they used CANNED mushrooms!!!!! Thats a disgrace to the original Philly!!!

 So I stopped going to Corleone's and went back to Charley's since they use fresh ingredients. Corleone's cost a lot more than Charley's however I'm not willing to pay more for canned ingredients, No Thanks!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the Tuesday bogo deals on cheesesteaks.  Pizza is decent too.

The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying after my experience I surly wish they had half or quarter stars and I am not often found with a lack of words but this is going to take some effort to stomach.

Strolled into this establishment at about 1:30 am, now to their credit I fully understand the crowd on mill at these hours so I lower my levels of expectations..

Place is moderately busy as we walk in, I get to the counter, order some pepperoni pizza and a pretzel with 2 drink cups. Second drink cup is forgot after they ran out of the dispenser, after I remind him he gets a fresh stock of cups to replenish his dispenser but first takes his hand, fingers placed inside the cup and hand me one. Yuck.. Gf didn't catch it so I gave her the first cup and took the lingering finger taste cup as my own.


Fast forward a few minutes, guy is in there , his friends are loud and his face is cut wide open from who knows what incident.. He is arguing and finally his friends get him out the door. Now if I ran this place that guy and his yelling and problems would have been asked to stay, his hands Nd bloody shirt bumping and squeezing past people was discussing . But.. Let's let that go because it's busy and again this is MIll and it is 2 am..



Fast forward 10 minutes.. Tell the guy the ice machine is out, several minutes later.. They fill it.. Again it's busy, no big deal on that one, and with the high temp in the place maybe it killed on the fingerprint bacteria in my cup while we waited.. \"I'm a wishful thinker\"

Several more minutes go buy of people bustling past, smearing nastily cheese wish sandwich wrappers all o over the floor as We walked by \"place was trashed\" I go back up and ask the guy for our order.. He said\", oh sorry forgot\" I was amused but it's just sliced pizza and a pretzel.. He tosses them in the oven, and a couple minutes later I get them. Well pizza had obviously been there forever but it was pizza, pretzel was hard as a rock and couldn't eat it.


Then the show starts.. there had been a few people in there, that obviously knew the gentlemen working the register, the flooding actions are the cause for this reviewing of the above..

Short list

-employee is wiping his sweaty face by hand, receiving money..then is prepping pizza with topping BY BARE HAND.. Placing it in the oven, all with out gloves. This occurs over and over, then when his friends arrive there is a round of hand slaps... Um.. Where did these guys come from, did they wash their hands?, eww.  So in the 45 minutes I am in here,no hand washing, no gloves..his hands on food, toppings, money, hands, face, along with all over surfaces possible. Freaking DISGUSTING.

But it gets better.. His friends that he is conversing with are about to ice the cake..  One of them this red headed guy is reaching behind the counter near the pick up, and grabbing fries out of the Bin with his hands.. This happens no less than 10 times..

Another one ask his to meet them in the bathroom... Um what? Yes.. That locked bathroom father 1 am that is closed off to customers.. Hmm my imagination can only wonder what brief activity occurred in the restroom. could my dazed and non health conscious server and front man for this business also be doing drug's one can only speculate. His actions after reflected a very relaxed and dazed person.

Where I will give this guy a couple points, is end of the night he started picking up the place as it had slowed, well this obviously is his job and they have to clean up at the end of the night anyways..but was surprised at this point. 

At this point and my food not eaten we are done being entertained by watching all this and he asked to take our plate at which time he noticed I didn't eat much. He asked if the pretzel was not good and I choose this time to politely tell him the reasons above as why we didn't finish. 

He took it in stride, with no attitude but said simply they got busy and backed up. I do appreciate that but honestly there is ZERO excuse for even a small percentage of the actions to have taken place. I see this as a health risk and was more comfortable at taco stands in Mexico than this establishment. 



In short, I'll be contacting the owner of this location. 

I do realize this is a late night food offering, I do realize the clientele, but I also know this is unacceptable and some poor guy who is mismanaging this place needs a wake up call.


I will be back very soon, if anything just to see if changes are made after I voice my concerns. If needed ill be happy to forward my videos to the county health inspector.


-Thanks for reading this little novel."}
{"text":"This place can never get it right.  They screw up my order every time whether it's something small like serving it for dine-in when I asked for it to go or giving me the wrong type of sandwich.  Today was the last straw which prompted me to write a review.  I had a coupon, $4.99 for ANY small combo with fries and a drink.  Well first they told me I had to have chips instead of fries unless I ordered a cheesesteak..says this no where on the coupon.  Fine, whatever.  The guy tells me $5.40 which is correct with tax..when I look at my charge slip he charged me $6.49 which is the regular price.  I didn't have time to argue over small change so fine, whatever (coupon was useless even though that's the whole reason I went there). When my order # is called it's in a tray for dine-in...and it's an italian rather than the turkey I ordered.  I tell the cook this and he wraps the italian to go and hands it to me.  I told him it was NOT what I ordered but what the cashier rang in and took it anyways because I didn't have time to wait around.  They failed in every aspect of this experience.  GET IT TOGETHER"}
{"text":"make sure you ask the guys at the counter for the $4.99 combo deal which includes a six-inch cheesesteak, yummy fries and drink. this deal is normally close to $10 so the coupon makes it a bargain.

their after 4pm $9 cheese pizza deal isn't bad either.

make sure you use the $4.99 for a dozen wing deal coupon too!"}
{"text":"Great philly cheese steak can't speak for the rest of the menu but the cheese steak was everything you want. They're not stingy with the meat either! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Glorious cheese whiz, oh how it has been missing in my life until now! My dad and I have been on a sandwich/hoagie kick lately and decided to give Corleone's a try...boy are we glad we did! 

On arrival we were warmly greeted by the staff and a pretty cool environment. There were giant pizzas on display that looked delicious, and the smell of steak fries wafted in the air. The restaurant is not fancy by any means, but it makes you feel like you are in Philly. Rocky movies are playing on the TVs and there are pictures and signs all over relating to the city; it's a fun upbeat atmosphere. 

After much deliberation over the menu we went with a buffalo chicken hoagie and an original cheez whiz cheesesteak. They gave us a number and we headed over to get fresh peppers and condiments at the little bar area they have set up. Something about free peppers makes you feel giddy inside. We waited a while for our food but it was obvious they were making it all fresh to order. The fries that I smelled walking in looked amazing, next time I'm getting fries! Our food arrived hot and ready to be devoured. My dad enjoyed his buffalo chicken and I loved my original with cheese whiz. Holy smokes I need more cheese whiz in my life! 

Corleone's isn't exactly cheap, but it doesn't break the bank either. We enjoyed our food and experience and will be back to try more goodies on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza, closest thing I have found to true NY style pizza.  Many places claim to have NY style and they are sadly mistaken. But the pizza here is the closest to home that i have found"}
{"text":"I have been to Corleone's a few times and this is the first time I have had cheese wiz on a cheese steak. (I'm a native Arizonian, what can I say?).

It was awesome and I really like how thinly the beef is shaved. 

Lets discuss Cheeze Whiz Fries for a moment. They are amazing, however EAT THEM QUICKLY. If Cheeze whiz is left to sit it congeals and Im not a huge fan. However if you do eat it quickly while its still all melty its one of the best things you can put in your mouth. :) Your taste buds will thank you! (Thank you Ocean Spray Commercial)


Its slightly overpriced for my liking, but when you are in the mood to treat yourself and are in the area it can be a fun place to go grab a bite, and certainly something you should try if you have not had the opportunity."}
{"text":"A friend took me there two years ago while on business. Was awesome then, and still is. This time I brought my son with me. The people that work there are great and the music is fantastic. Hopefully it won't be another two years to get back."}
{"text":"Long wait it took forever for them to come and take my order then it took forever for them to make the food they forgot the onions and no peppers this place isn't what it used to be :("}
{"text":"We both got the Philly Cheesesteak and it was pretty good. Nothing to write home about or even a review but it was ok. It's in a good location so if you're in the area it's worth a try."}
{"text":"To all of you folks who stare in disbelief at the cheez whiz cans, this place isn't for you.  This place is for those of us who fell in love with Pat's Steaks and can't afford to fly to Philly when we get that urge for a giant slab of yummy goodness.  Seriously, I refuse to buy a cheesesteak sandwich from any shop that doesn't have the whiz.

The owner is a nice guy.  The fact that he tries to make conversation while you make your order when most cashier drones at other shops just give you disinterested looks is a plus.  True, the conversation may veer toward awkward or strange, but at least he's being personable. I won't take that away from the man.

The only thing that I don't like about Corleone's is the price.  I will still pay what they're asking for what amounts to the best damn cheesesteak this side of the Susquehanna river, but I'd be much happier if the prices lined up with what I used to pay at Pat's.  If the prices came down, I'd be there a whole lot more."}
{"text":"We've eaten here at least 3 times already in the last couple of months! My wife and I love it! Haven't had Cheese Whiz since I was a kid, so its kind of special. My wife brought me the cheesesteak fries last night. My life is changed! I have a new appreciation for Corleone's now. Its so good, it will have you licking the cheese off of the tray paper (if you are a true Cheese Whiz fan). Of course, we had the cheesesteaks as well...don't tell me how many calories were in both the big cheesesteak sandwich and the cheesesteak fries...I'm having at the present point not knowing. I'll exercise later today!

Just know their food is EXCELLENT! I need to plan a trip to the top cheesesteak places in Philly one day for a comparison, but in my book, Corleone's is top notch!"}
{"text":"YEEEAAHHHHHHHHHHH I LOVE YOU GUYS SOOOOOOO MUCH... There's not much out here that an eastcoast girl can get that reminds me of home.. You guys rock (don't know how to do the symbol) I am also a VIP customer.. The FOOD IS AWESOMEEEEWEEEEEE.. Especially on my cheat days.. Lol Thank you guys so much.. FYI every time I've come to the Scottsdale location AMAZING customer service and today I just ordered from Tatum (PV) location AWESOMMMEE customer service.."}
{"text":"WAY too expensive for what you get.

It may be one of the only places in Tempe that uses the authentic \"wiz\", however I don't want to pay for the novelty when I can get a better sandwich for $3 less at The Munchies Cafe on 6th and Mill.  

Corleones offers other cheeses than the \"wiz\", and when I ordered my sandwich with provolone they didn't give me any crap about it.  That doesnt mean it was good.  The sandwich was almost $10, and it wasn't very big."}
{"text":"Ordered in from Corleone's tonight. I've never eaten there before, so I didn't know what to expect. Here is what was good:  
1- ordering through the Yelp app was very easy and my order arrived earlier than scheduled and was delivered by a very nice person;
2- our onion rings were super crispy and wonderful and they accommodated our request for lots of extra ketchup;
3- our antipasto salad was simple and fresh and came with chips and a drink.

Not so good:
We were going to share the buffalo chicken sandwich... but ended up not being what either one of us expected or enjoyed. It was finally minced chicken, smothered in buffalo sauce, and stuffed into soft hero bread doused in blue cheese dressing. The way they did the meat was just odd. Granted, the Yelp app did not provide any description of the sandwich beyond the name, and I chose to order it anyway, so it was my own fault for assuming that it was going to be different from what I received. Nonetheless it grossed us both out and left me feeling like despite the positives, I probably would not order from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I just love love love this place, I have been looking for the cheese steak that resembles my home town cheese steak.

I request my cheese steak with cheese wiz, marinara sauce in the steak and no onions, this is the closest thing to a true Philly cheese steak, people do not realize most Philly cheese steaks are really not Philly cheese steaks at all. 

A true cheese steak is shredded steak,,,shredded people, SHREDDED! LOL :)

My brother loves the pepperoni steak sandwich, with the marinara sauce.

The pizza looks awesome, New York style, hand tossed, looks as close to home hand tossed, this will be my next venture but I can't help but get my sandwich every visit.

Staff is always terrific and food is excellent.

They also have Tastykakes, most of the time."}
{"text":"I snub my nose at you zealous purists out there. I like my cheese steaks bastardized. Hold your cheese whiz. Drop the beef and toss on some chicken. And make sure to add vegetables. Yes, vegetables. Blasphemy, I know. Give me mushrooms, onions, green peppers, tomatoes. Mmmm. In fact, you could even hold the meat and I would be alright with that. 

The hot sandwiches at Corleone's are a happy medley of these two extremes. For the purists, there's the Philly Original and for us West Coast blasphemers there's everything from Buffalo Chicken to Veggie Subs. The fries are pretty decent (it takes some real effort--or neglect--to fuck up french fries) but the onion rings leave a lot to be desired. 
 
I've tried a couple different hot sandwiches, including the Philly Original, and it's always a greasy, messy event. The majority of the time the juice and grease of the contents melt right through the damn roll, leaving me with a pile of napkins, a mangled sandwich, and a frown on my face. (I really dislike it when my food falls apart. I usually bite of it as hard as I can to try and inflict pain on the offending meal. The food has never acknowledged my attack. It's a pretty irrational tradition.) So if keeping your sandwich in one edible piece is big in your book, I wouldn't recommend this place. 

The actual restaurant is pretty small, with a long bar with stools and several high tables to enjoy your vittles at. It's also a little bit on the hot side since half of the restaurant is the kitchen, and it gets a bit noisy with all the ordering, grilling and chit chat, but it's a really lively atmosphere and they offer delivery or take out if you're in a hurry. They're open really late too, especially on the weekends, in order to cater to the Mill Avenue night life.

On Tuesdays they have a special that's pretty ace. It's a buy one get one deal on any sandwich in the place--of equal or lesser value (just imagine that in small print)--so you and a friend can eat for cheap or you've got one sandwich for dinner and another for lunch the next day.

I know a lot of people that adore this place, but it's just not my thing. Cheese steaks are not the food of gods to me, but if the thought of hot beef and cheese whiz has you gargling saliva like Homer Simpson, you'll probably enjoy it and rate it higher."}
{"text":"I still remember the first time I walked in to try the sandwiches at Corleone's.

I stood there in front of the register gazing at the menu thinking about what I would or should or could order. 

The guy with a military type buzz cut  interrupted unfocused decision making process asking me if this were my first time in. I responded saying yes and he immediately punched in a few buttons on the register as he told me what I would be having.

For a moment I though to myself \"what a rude a-hole but then I thought well the guy knows whats good there and then I thought about how many times I wanted to just skip passed the silliness of dealing with indecisiveness of many people I had to work with and decided I liked that jerk who took my order.

I must say the order was definitely not what I would have ever chosen for myself but it was insanely good. It actually became the most common sandwich I would eat from that place. I introduced many people to this place and most feel the same that it is very good.

Now that I am here in Dallas, TX I have even recommended this place to friends out here when I found out they would be going out to Scottsdale for business. They ended up coming back bragging about how much they liked it."}
{"text":"Cheesesteaks rock... meatball subs even better!!  Make sure you check this place out!  Good food/good service."}
{"text":"They suck. Plain and simple. The last 3 times I ordered for delivery their response is \" oh we can't deliver right now. Our driver is blocked in.\" Or \" we only had two people working so we can't deliver\". This place is over priced, the meat is bland. No seasonings at all. Too much bread. Their \"pizza\" is basically ketchup on cardboard. And the staff is tolerable- and I'm being nice. Genos cheesesteaks is farther and has a way better menu choice. A little overpriced but waaaaaay more worth my cash and time than Corleone's. avoid Corleone's unless you like bland food with grease and lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Delish buffalo chicken sandwich, the little joey's cheesesteak with cheese wis was amazing too. Will definitely try them again!"}
{"text":"I was not the one who ate here, i opted to go to Jimmy Johns next door, and according to my brother who did eat here, was the right choice. There were two orders in front of him which were already placed and it took them 10 minutes to then take his order of a Philly Cheese Steak, Onion Rings and a drink. By this time i had gone to Jimmy Johns, got my order, and walked over to CVS to pick something up, and walked back to Corleones to get my brother. We waited a few minutes and then his order finally came. I asked what his total was, almost $16!! They charged extra for Onions and Mushrooms (or peppers, can't remember) $1.49 each! These come standard on Philly cheese steaks and we know this because we lived in Philadelphia for 4 years with many real cheese steaks had that were WAY better and 2/3 the price!! My brother said it tasted good, but not for that price and he would have rather gone to Duck & Decanter, Wineburger (both down the road) or even Postinos just for some Bruschetta. If i were him i would rather just go up the road to the Rokerji's reverse Happy hour starting at 9 and get a glass of wine ($5), and their tip steak + Brei bruschetta bites ($5)."}
{"text":"Ordered online and picked it up when it was scheduled to be ready. I normally go to the location on 16th St and this was my first time at the Mill location and wasn't disappointed. Some of the other reviews made me nervous but I would happily go here again.

Update: Been back a couple times and it seems like they're doing something different. Normally the meat and cheese are mixed together but the last couple times I've gone, the cheese is sitting at the bottom of the bread where it congeals into a mess and the meat is on top. It really makes the cheese over-powering and I find myself scraping it off."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Corleone's in almost a year, but I was thinking about sandwiches and remembered how much I liked Corleone's, so this review is a bit overdue. 

First time I went I remember thinking \"Cheez Whiz on a sandwich?\" but I was told to try it before I complained and I did. I used that same spiel on my mom when I took her and she frowned at Cheez Whiz being on her sandwich. Needless to say, we were both wrong. The Philly Cheese Steak at Corleone's is amazing. They also have really good fries and that's pretty much the only two things I've ever eaten there in spite of having been there probably a dozen times. Even if you're apprehensive, go and give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love there Tuesday special buy a large sandwich get one free. We got a reward for a free fry. What a disappointment the oldest guy there made my order of fries. It wasn't even half of and order of a small fry. We have had plenty of fries there to know the difference...Old guy is always crabby & in a bad mood with a chip on his shoulder. 
I need to find new place to get my philly cheese sandwich. Even though the sandwich ok there."}
{"text":"I see a lot of complaints about delivery, but I don't really think that's Corleone's fault. Their food is absolutely delicious for philly cheese steaks."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars but the customer service is terrible.  The food is great.  The first time I ordered I called in to order a pizza the guy on the phone acted like it was the hardest thing to do and was rude.  I figured OK maybe he's having a bad day.  Pizza was great.  I went in the restaurant two days ago. My boyfriend was getting a Philly and I asked for their Anti-Pasta salad and the manager goes nope we are all out of salad.  Really I'm sure salad is a high selling product here (mind you this is right after they opened.)  So I get a Philly and of course the food was good the restaurant was dirty food and napkins on tbe floor and the tables were dirty."}
{"text":"Horrible. Slow. Bland. Overpriced. Period.

If you're into dry cheesesteaks that take 20 mins to get to you. This is your spot."}
{"text":"Amazing costumer service as I walk in to enjoy my delicious Philly cheese stake and pizza made by Jorge thanks !"}
{"text":"Nothing special,  ended up in this place because rusconi's was closed.  Employees look miserable and have zero customer appriciation."}
{"text":"Well I think I've had my sodium and sugar intake for the week. Great cheese steaks need great bread. And Corleone's delivers. I mean on the bread. Nice, soft and fresh. I have no idea if they actually deliver. Sliced rib eye meat, grilled onions and the sauteed mushrooms I added all held together by THE WIZ baby...I'm all about the WIZ. And I rarely drink soda, but was given a humungous to go cup and I filled it half with Hi C orange fruit punch (when was the last time ya'll had HI C?) and half with Sprite. Damn good. Damn good. Finished it all off with some decent fries and watched Headline News. Place was clean. Service was great."}
{"text":"When I'm craving new York style pizza they always hit the spot I love there cheese pizza so Yummy! 

Steak fries are good to with her with or without cheese.

Trying buffalo chicken today!"}
{"text":"This is the best buffalo chicken sandwich that I've ever had.  The fries are remarkable.  This was my favorite place to eat while I lived in Phoenix, by far, and what I miss most about the whole state.  It's pathetic, I know.

The restaurant has pretty awesome ambience for a sports fan, big wooden tables and lots of screens playing ESPN or whatever big game is on.  I've come here for a couple games and stayed with friends to watch half a game.

The cheesesteak is fine (though I'd never choose it over the buffalo chicken).  I've tried \"da Roc and Manuch\", but it's just a bland marinara chicken sub.  The Godfather sounded promising, and normally I love italian-meat sandwiches, but it's just too heavy and the bread doesn't really work with this kind of sandwich.

Being my favorite place, I'm bummed to see so many poor reviews.  But they are mostly legit complaints.  The service can be pretty terrible, and it seems they only hire jerks to work the line.  The meals are expensive--it's like $12 for a meal with fries and drink.  But if you get the coupons and their occasional emails, it drops down to $5 for the same thing.  The delivery also does take a while, but whenever I'd have it delivered to work, I'd just make sure to order it an hour ahead and they're usually there when they say they'll make it.

Overall, it's a pricy place but you get what you pay for.  It's an original and unique place, definitely worth eating in at."}
{"text":"I work on Mill Ave and wanted to try something new so I gave Corleone's a shot. A sign on the window advertised a Phili Combo for $5 or $6 available everyday however, when I asked the guy inside about a lunch combo he rudely informed me that they don't have one. I still gave it a chance and got the small Buffalo Chicken Phili. The sandwich was alright but not worth the $7.50 I payed for it. There wasn't much meat and the bread fell apart after the first bight. I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"They are growing on me. My favorite Cheese steak place is Philadelphia Sandwich company in Old town. But Corleones just opened here and it's close AND they deliver. Been twice and food was good. And they do their fries well done. Unlike 5 Guys right around the corner in the same parking lot. Plus Corleones has an old Philly favorite- Tastykakes! YAY!!"}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza!!! It's about $15 for a large cheese and it's well worth it!!! The pizzas are very large and very delicious!!! The staff was very friendly, and the environment was nice and clean. I'd definitely go there again!!"}
{"text":"Growing up in the northeast originally, I'm very picky on the many businesses here that throw a city in their name and don't live up to the food standards. Corleone's is DELICIOUS and well priced. Great atmosphere and staff inside as well. I would be surprised if the owner or \"powers that be\" aren't actually from Philly."}
{"text":"the BEST philly cheesesteaks! I go here at least once a week and my food always comes out hot and delicious. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is not even close to the best place for a cheesesteak.  This doesn't really surprise me considering there are only two places I have been to in the West that makes a GOOD cheesesteak, one is in Scottsdale and the other in Orange County, CA.

Right off the bat their prices are WAY too high for what you get.  They have an option on the menu for \"Extra Steak $2.50\".  WTF??  I'm paying $10 for a sandwich and there's a chance I might want more steak on my sandwich?  Hell no.  For $10 I had better not be able to finish that thing, just the way it comes.  Well, turns out I should have paid the $2.50 b/c the regular portion was very weak.  Of course then I would have had a $12.50 mediocre cheesesteak instead of a $10 mediocre cheesesteak.

This place left a lot to be desired and I'll never waste my time there again.  Just as I had expected... overpriced and mediocre."}
{"text":"Struck w/a pizza craving walking south along Mill from Tempe Beach Park...then, we spotted Corleone's.  One of those bike-pedal-cabs girls went by shouting, \"I'll get you, my pretties...I'll get you home!\" We thought that was weird but we kept walking up this yellow brick road. (Overly-hungry-hallucinations?) When we got within range of this little shop ... the aroma of dough, meat and cheese swept us up like a regular Dorothy and Toto inspired twister... dough and meat and cheese, oh my...

When we came to, 

Were we stuffed. 
We were satisfied!
We were smacking our lips and saying:

\"There's no place like Corleone.\"  

Lick that Little Joey's Philly cheesy steak Hoagie bit from your lip and sneak in a bite of 'za! Who needs Oz when you can have 'Za!? 

Delicious from start to finish, Corleone's did not disappoint - right down to the amply piled and requisite condiments from sliced dill pickles and whole little peppers and sliced banana peppers that are free at the condiment counter. The guys work the galley kitchen right in front of ya and they were just the right amount of pro and friendly. 

I barely have the heart to mention that my wonderful friend wasn't 100% satisfied with the taste of the Buffalo Chicken sandwich...it was a bit more three star-rish. (It was more like chicken w/ a lot of tabasco applied.)  I did muster up the courage to ask the man behind the curtain (er, counter) for extra salt (that's where it's kept.)  Anyone with a brain would fine that these prices would calm even the worst of flying monkeys. That means...they're a-ok.

The shop is tight (but not the kind of tight you can fix with a can of oil), maybe ten or so eat-in tables) but there's also four tables outside. Two tvs round it out inside and there you have a nice little eatery. 

I'd be a-lion if I didn't say, \"I'm melting!!\" Actually, wicked witches aside...the only thing melting here is: \"cheese!\" ... & food! in your mouth."}
{"text":"I stopped in at the new PV store, and had a slice of pizza.  Good, greasy, big slice of cheese.  It was pretty good: good enough to want to order a whole pizza on a Sunday night. 
Problem is, THEY CLOSE AT 6 PM on Sundays!  wtf?  What kind of pizza place isn't open past 6??"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good as is the pizza...although a bit overpriced considering the quality."}
{"text":"If your looking to fill your stomach, Corleone's is a favorite of mine.  While it's not the cheapest, it is worth it.  great for lunches or after a long night.  

The first time I heard The Wiz it sounded like Cheeze Wiz but I was assured that it was much better than canned pressurized cheese...I was no mislead."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last week since recently moving to the neighborhood. The pizza  was amazing can't wait to try the cheese steaks."}
{"text":"I'm from philly and know what I'm looking for in a cheese steak.. Corleone's nails it every time...High quality ingredients (worth a little more) and great service..only problem is that they now have great pizza too so what am I supposed to do? Keep up the great work! See you for this weekends email special as usual"}
{"text":"Growing up in PA, I had no idea that \"Philly Cheese Steaks\" really were only in Philadelphia. I just always assumed they were one of the basic food groups, and took it for granted that everyone had them.

Not so. 

Corleone's is the only place in Phoenix that makes them for real. Maybe they could use just a little more grease, but they have wiz, which almost makes up for it. Also, the guys working here the night I visited reminded me of the beefy guidos who work Reading Terminal Market."}
{"text":"Some (fake) red head at the cash register has a serious attitude problem if you aren't happy with your job get a new one she obviously Overcharged me & gave me a dumb look like it was my fault she didn't know how to do her job then comes a fellow co worker who tells me look at the bottom of the receipt it shows were you get the 2 pizza's & drink for 5.99 but he didn't even bother looking...I didn't even bother to confront them because of their stupidity"}
{"text":"This place seemed so much better years ago. I paid $50 for TWO sub par mediocre at best pizzas. The 'veggie' situ was a joke...olives, onions, canned jalapeños....just not good. Unless there's a fund raiser involved, skip this joint."}
{"text":"I really liked this place when I came here during college :(

I got excited to stop by again after leaving from school, so i scooted over as soon as I had a chance.  I got there, and saw the menu, and the whiz, and got pretty excited!

And I kept looking the menu.  And kept looking.  And kept looking.  And then wondered if anyone was working?  And looked at my friend, confusedly.  And then we bounced.

We just sat there for a few minutes, with nothing going on.  How does that happen?  We ended up walking down the street to get food...immediately :(

It also looked more expensive than I remember it being, but I could be wrong.  I don't remember paying $9 for a regular sized sandwich tho.

Also, they were playing Ion on their TV.  Ion?  Wtf?  There was football and basketball on.   And they were playing...Ion?

I still have a fondness in my heart for this place but...how can I positively review a place where it didn't look like people were working?"}
{"text":"Delivery times are a joke, however, I am from Pennsylvania so I know pizza and subs. NYPD doesn't hold a candle to east coast pizza like these guys. It's the closest to a real east coast slice I've found so far. The peppers on the condiment bar are just like philly. Get your orders out quicker and it'll be five starts yo."}
{"text":"Can not pay for delivery with a Corleone's gift card so  REALLY!!  had to go pick up got there late still had to wait 15-20 min the guy on the phone was cool but the bottom line the pizza taste like card board and the wings put it this way i got 48 wings and 2 large pizza's for 6 people they all had a slice and a wing or two after that no one would touch it bottom line Corleone's sucks!!!"}
{"text":"Went here again for the Philly cheesesteaks, Maan those are good! And they are a decent size, as well as the pizza from this place. But if you do get a Philly make sure you ask for either provolone or mozzarella. Otherwise they'll give you cheese whiz but the food is good, staff is great and friendly, and it's a good deal."}
{"text":"The wait was bearable, the food okay, but the service and cleanliness was unacceptable. I will not be returning until these areas are addressed and improved."}
{"text":"full of grease tons of meat cheese wiz ... the real deal... just like they make them in the 215... authentic philly cheese steaks at this place"}
{"text":"Who ever rated this place not that good doesn't know how to eat I ate Philly cheesesteaks Jims and Pats and it's near there it was BOMB !"}
{"text":"Decided to try out Corleone's this evening, as I had noticed it last time I was in this shopping center.  They were super busy when I walked in, a guy apologized and said he would be with me asap, and he was hauling ass so I didn't mind.  They were understaffed and didn't have a cashier.

I ordered a small (which was more like a regular-sized) cheesesteak with onions and american cheese, fries, and a soda.  Came out to about ten bucks as a combo with tax.  It was ready fairly quickly.  They had a small bar with pickles, banana peppers, giardiniera,  and what might have been pickled cherry peppers.  The sandwich was good, the bread was nice and soft, good chunks of grilled onion.  The fries were crispy and yummy.  Overall I enjoyed it, and I will be back again."}
{"text":"I liked this place but I don't love it. I had the Chicken Italiano 'wit' grilled onions. I upgraded to a combo and had cheese fries, which was the highlight of the meal. I think if I ever come back I would order everything with philly cheese whiz maybe that will convince me to give this place another star."}
{"text":"I was craving a Philly Cheese Steak today and so after considering the reviews of a number of restaurants offering them. I decided that Corleone's was the best bet for a real Philadelphia style cheese steak near my zip code. 

Because it is a chain, I arrived slightly skeptical, and ready to have a less than wonderful experience, in spite of the positive ratings. Thank goodness the positive reviews were accurate!

I arrived barely ahead of the lunch crowd. At least 15 people crowded in right behind me, which I took for a good sign. I ordered the small rib eye steak sandwich \"wit\" (with) grilled onions, grilled peppers & mushrooms, and mozzarella cheese. I skipped the cheese wiz because my memory of Philly cheese steaks in Philly and NY as I was growing up had NO association what-so-ever with cheese wiz. The young man who took my order was very helpful with my order, and my eventual cheese choice of mozzarella over provolone.  (Mozzarella melts better he said, and he was right!)

My sandwich was completely cooked to order. There was no partially cooked steak sitting to the side of a grill waiting to be warmed and served - this was cooked fresh! The onions, mushrooms and green peppers were also perfectly grilled, and combined with the meat and mozzarella cheese were perfect! The bun initially had a bit of crunch, so I think that the inside was grilled or toasted.

All in all, it was a delicious sandwich. The meat was nicely cooked and the sandwich was nice and juicy and perfectly seasoned. I added a combination of the hot cherry peppers and a few sweet cherry peppers from the condiment bar to my sandwich to make each bite just right. The cheese was perfectly hot and melted, creating delicious strands of cheese from the sandwich to my mouth. Once I started eating, I could not put the sandwich down. It was REALLY good. FAR better than I would have expected from a Philly Cheese Steak in Arizona...

I didn't try any of the sides, but the pizza did look really good. I think it will be a while however, before I have anything but the cheese steak - just like I had it today!

For a small cheese steak and a small drink, my tab was nine dollars and change, but it was worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This was my 1st  time here and I was greeted with a smile and hello (just rarely happens so thought I'd point it out) The cashier helped me order and I opted for the rib eye Philly cheese steak with onion and mozzarella with fries and a drink. The staff really seemed to like their jobs and all worked well together and the food was delicious. There was a place with pepperocinis, cherry peppers and pickles to put on your sandwiche. The restaurant was decked out in Philly memorabilia as well and was very clean. You need to check this place out."}
{"text":"I'm all for Corleone's. Great cheese steaks in a nice atmosphere. I usually go with the original with provolone. I know, you're supposed to have Cheese Wiz, but I'm just not into processed cheese. The service is great and the people who work there are always friendly. Thumbs up to cheese steaks from Corleone's!"}
{"text":"Real Cheez Whiz on your cheesesteak... YES!!! A great end to any night of drinking."}
{"text":"I don't even normally LIKE philly cheese steaks- but the sandwiches here are AMAZING! They put cheez whiz on them. WHAT?! I know, sounds completely revolting, right? Turns out it isn't. I though cheez whiz was E-Z Cheez. Nope, it is something completely different. Combine that with the grilled onions, and perfectly grilled steak chunks? Hello taste bud meltdown experience.  

And the Cheez Whiz fries with grilled onions? HOLY Mother of God are those GOOOOOD! I don't even want to take a guess on what the caloric intake is on either- but if you don't care, or only want to eat once that week anyway- take a trip to Corleone's. You won't regret it. (Well, you may if you don't wear your stretchy pants when you go)"}
{"text":"Good cheese pizza and the cops that go there as customers adds an extra feeling of safety."}
{"text":"Go for the fries!! 

Use their coupon for the cheese steak. Because it seems like the gansta thing to do. 

So, we were mailed a coupon for a 1/2 sandwich with fries and a drink for $5. Sounds like a smoking deal, but the best part wasn't the sandwich. It wasn't the worst thing ever, but it was meh and lacked something. My sandwich was just laying there like a bored hooker. I snarfed the fries down on my drive back to the office and they really are good. Perhaps, if I return, stuffing the fries in the sandwich would liven it up? Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps."}
{"text":"We really like their cheesesteaks and the pizza is pretty good. The service isn't top notch by any means. One particular visit was for a birthday dinner and we brought a cake. The manager said we could not use their forks for the cake. They even went as far as removing the forks from the island for the rest of the customers in an effort to hide them from our six person party. That is just laughable, but I guess if business is tight you have to watch every piece of plastic. Even when your customers pay about $10 for a small combo."}
{"text":"I have been to Philly and had the cheese steak there. This place does its best to replicate that in the Valley of the Sun. Even the interior of this location has the interior feel of an east coast, Italian, fast-casual restaurant
I like their topping bar to pile up your cheese steak with just the right about of peppers."}
{"text":"Yeah, the food here isn't all that bad.  I'd give the food 4 stars by itself.  But...

Service = shit
restaurant = shit

Normally you get what you pay for, but the prices here are a fucking insane.  On my last visit, I paid somewhere around 14 dollars for a cheesesteak, fries, and drink and slice of pizza.  The girl at the counter told me a price after I asked her roughly what the total would be (told me all that would be about 8 bucks) and after ringing up the total, it was around 14.  OK...  

When asked what I wanted on it, I asked for wiz but light on it.  A few people working there laughed at me.  Hey fuckers, were not in Philly, were in the desert.  Some of us don't like that much on the sandwich.  A guy making my sandwich spills some steak on the counter, picks it up with his fingers and puts it back on the sandwich.  Nice.  He gives me a \"what is your problem\" look.  Another lady working there spent the ENTIRE time (waiting in line, ordering, waiting for food, and eating) looking at her cell phone.

Anyway, the food is awesome, worth trying if you don't mind the price tag.  Sitting in the restaurant to eat itself is cramped.  I was lucky enough to get a seat at the \"bar\" that is crooked.  My drink falls over.  I try to clean it up but there is a line of people standing around me.  I give up.  The condiment bar looks like a dog gnawed a ton of shit together and left it there.  I couldn't tell what was what.  They were out of ketchup.  I didn't even bother telling them.

I will agree that the food here does resemble what you get in Philly (minus the pizza, stay away from that.  Came out cold, told them, they did nothing) but hardly worth putting up with the fucking service there.  If I wanted to be treated like shit I'll go to work, but I'm not paying for it.

*updated as of 3/17/211*
Lowering to one star.  Decided to give this place a try again and they pissed me off.  Ordered two slices of pizza before a St. Patricks day adventure.  Ordered to a guy who told me to \"wait a second\" as he was checking his cell phone.  For about two minutes.  What the fuck?  Took my order and I waited.  Drunk college girls came in after me (bear in mind, this was around 6p.m.) and gave my food to them because they ordered the same thing.  I wait.  Again longer.   He flirts with them.  I ask him about my food.  He is checking his cell phone.  I hear employees at the soda fountain saying \"We aren't going to have enough fucking ice tonight!\" as they asked the cook for a kitchen knife to cut ice bags open.  Cook take the knife back after it is it used for cutting open ice bags and dropped two times on the floor, and hands it back to the cook.  I only was able to observe this because I spent the better part of 20 minutes waiting for my food with nothing else to do.  He cuts bread with it without washing it.  Lovely.

Since they \"forgot\" about my order so John Q. Cashregister could forget about mine and give it away to try and hook up with college girl customer, my pizza slices were only warmed up for about 30 seconds.  The center was cold.  A few bites into it, I throw the rest in the garbage.

And the napkin dispenser is out.  I tell the guy but he is too obsessed with getting pussy.  F this place.

I hope the owner of this place reads this."}
{"text":"I've been ordering (delivery) from Corleone's for some time now and every single time the food is pretty good, fresh and hot. Their cheese steak sandwiches are quite good. I'm always looking for reliable food delivery and this place does deliver every single time."}
{"text":"Kind of warm in there. Sun beats against the windows.  Great service when ordering. Ordered my birthday sandwich.  They allowed me to upgrade to a full sandwich.  Excellent rib eye and provolone sandwich, hot fries and large drink."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Corleone's. First of all, the name is awesome. The food is good but not great. The thing that makes it 4 stars, in my opinion, is their pricing. I recently ordered a huge pizza and a side of mozzarella sticks for delivery on a Friday night. The total price for my order (including tip) was $15. Full disclosure, I had a $5 off coupon from a previous order but that isn't the point. 

Cheap & good food. Can't beat it."}
