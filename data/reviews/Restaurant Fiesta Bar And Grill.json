{"text":"You need to bring your group to this  place if you want to experience a horrible experience. My group the Note Investors Forum Meetup contracted with the Fiesta Restaurant beginning in January 2018. They gave a room to use for the 1st meeting, then said the price would increase to $600/event plus the food. The Feb & March & April meeting were moved to the restaurant at the same $14/plate compete. With the cash attendees their net per plate increased to $18. Then... today we were informed the pricing was increasing to $23/plate. This place is running a total bait and Switch. The service is great if you as the organizer want to serve your own attendees water, silverware etc and present to your group at the same time. The food was OK. The restaurant managers attitude was substandard. Do yourself a favor, never ever patronize this restaurant. Dave F."}

{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here last night on our way home from visiting a friend in the hospital up the street.  The atmosphere here is exactly what I needed to lift my spirits.  All of the staff is very friendly and attentive!  The chips and salsa are spot on, very flavorful salsas.  We ordered enchiladas and tacos, and were so incredibly pleased, that we already agreed to come back next weekend.  The food is absolutely packed with flavor and the portions are perfect.  Both of us had margaritas, my husband's was a house blend, mine was strawberry.  This was the first time I had one on the rocks, and I was NOT disappointed!  Shortly after we arrived, the music started.  I was very pleased that the music was geared towards my generation for once.  My husband and I were singing along with everything that came over the sound system.  The location is lit up for the holidays, so it is very cheerful.  As we were leaving, the owner, Estoban, came up to us, thanked us for coming, and told us his plans for the establishment.  He was so charming and sincerely appreciative for our business.  I HIGHLY recommend checking Fiesta Bar and Grill out, you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, this Mexican restaurant!  Conveniently located and delicious food, great service too!!!  Love the fireplace on the patio and bar that opens up to the outside."}
{"text":"We've lived in the neighborhood by the Dobson ranch inn for many years and have been hoping for a restaurant to walk to. We tried this restaurant tonight and was glad we did. We had fajitas which were very tasty and a kids taco which was a great portion size. Our server was very friendly and checked on us many times and the manager stopped by twice to make sure everything was good. He also noticed that my husband was wearing his fire station shirt and was very appreciative of his service. The staff was also very friendly to our small children. They also have a Sunday brunch menu which looks so good we will be back to try it!  The prices were also very reasonable, on par with any other Mexican food establishment. We will definitely be back and just hope this place advertises more so others know of it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, great food, and awesome staff who made sure we had everything we needed. If you go bring cash to tip. There was no spot on our bill to leave a tip."}
{"text":"So we ate here today. I read most of the reviews saying amazing food and authentic mexican since we lost one of our favorite mexican food restaurants. Well I can tell you WRONG! The food was average but not authentic what so ever. Anyone that has authentic mexican can surely tell you this restaurant was not up to par.   On top of that we were literally the only 2 in the entire place and there was one waiter/bartender and he was more concerned with replacing the papers in a picture frame then getting our drinks or food order. Will we go back? Probably not"}
{"text":"Food is definitely uh. However, the worst is the \"bait & switch\" they pulled on our meeting group. Quoted us a price, then in a month raised it (a lot)! We met for lunch during the week, so sort of found business, since there was NO ONE else there. We have a group of about 50, served a very ordinary buffet which never varied (they served so we didn't eat too much) w tea & water as beverage. Don't take your group there - so so food and one waiter was rude! No more for me or group! Back to our old venue where they're happy to see us, nice menu & reasonable."}
