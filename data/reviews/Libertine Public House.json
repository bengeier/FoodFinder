{"text":"I've frequented Libertine a few times. I'm not a beer drinker, so hence, I'm rating it on atmosphere and food.  Atmosphere is OK. It gets quite busy and loud in there, if that's what you're looking for.  The food isn't all that great. At all. The first time I was there I ordered the trout salad. Out came a salad with a FULL trout, head attached, skin, belch yuk!! I do not want to pick through my food, skin it, and have a fish smiling back at me.  The next time I went I ordered the jerk chicken sandwich minus the bun. This was actually pretty tasty. The manager/owner gave us a free appetizer of deep fried chickpeas. They were interesting, but not something we finished or would order again.  The last visit there I ordered a gluten-free flat bread. It was pretty good, but there was soooo much flat bread, and not enough topping! The crust was great because it was actually a home made gluten free crust!"}
{"text":"I was told to come here by a friend to try to the fries. When someone says try the fries you think these better be darn good fries! She raved about the fries for days so finally last night I happened to be down town and decided to stop in for some food and of course these magical fries I heard so much about.   I ordered the duck poppers to start now for the price I wasn't to crazy about only getting 4 on a plate. However when I ate one bliss came over me. They were spicy, cheesey, and did I mention wrapped in bacon?! YUM! Everything I like in 1 appy including duck I'm hooked!  I got the public house burger just so I could have the fries. The burger didn't wow me. I found the meat dry, the bacon over cooked, and the burger as a whole didn't give me that juicy mouth watering feeling when I bit into it. However the fries.... yes those fries were amazing. I could have eaten a plate of just fries infact I wish I had because that burger was not worth it for the filling meal I was hoping for. However the fries and the duck poppers alone is what I based my rating on. Seriously they really saved the day."}
{"text":"The only reason I keep coming back to this place is for Pubstumpers trivia.  Mediocre pizza and sandwiches. Can't really put my finger on why - the pizza is just joyless. Also had an Oktoberfest schnitzel sandwich that was dry, tough and soggy at the same time. The fries that came on the side were over-browned.  They have Lone Tree cider on tap, which I like."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and I was appealed by the service I received. The location and restaurant are very nice, the prices were good, but the service was so horrible. The group of us had to get up and leave after waiting 40 minutes for anything to come out onto our table. The servers seemed like they were high and had no idea what they were doing. It took so long to give our order and sat forever to try to get a refill. One sever was taking all the orders while other people delivered the foods to completely wrong tables and wrong people. One thing that turned me off the most was the dirty cups we were getting our drinks in, after asking for new cups they returned with even dirtier ones.    Unless service changes, I don't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Would not return here again! Went here on a Friday evening for a drink after work with a colleague and a friend. Saying this it was not overly busy with the majority of tables around us empty. We waited about 10 mins for the waitress to initally come over and waited another 10 for the drinks. We felt like a cocktail so opted for the Sangria. Tasted awful! As if it was made from a packet and not even a slice of fruit with it. Two of us didnt even finish it it was that bad.  We waited then about 20 mins after deciding we wanted to leave for the bill - no sign of our server anywhere! And it wasnt busy!!!  So we left money - that we wanted change for!!!! - and left.  Thats how bad it was!  That waitress got a good tip for rubbish service!! So I wouldnt advise any one to visit this place or return."}
{"text":"I had never been here before until yesterday, but I finally got an opportunity to visit when a friend decided to hold a birthday party here.  I was really looking forward to visiting.  I'd always walk by and think what an impressive establishment it was.  Yesterday, I came about an hour late.  I had ordered the same drink as my friend did, as I just wanted something fast.  Unfortunately, the night seemed a comedy of errors. The drink I got (a Sin City) was what my friend Crystal E. originally ordered, but it turns out they gave her the wrong drink.  It took forever for the server to check on us, and when she finally got to us, I tried to order a BBQ Chicken flatbread, but after an hour, it never came.  Eventually, a bunch of us decided to go to Melrose hoping for better service.  I asked for my bill as I was really hungry and just wanted to leave at that point, and was surprised that my flatbread wasn't on the bill (happy though that they didn't charge me for something they forgot to bring).  Anyways, we all left for Melrose and ironically, they saw me complain about my hunger on Twitter (I never named Libertine though) and they had a complementary BBQ Chicken pizza waiting for me when I arrived. As it was 10pm and I hadn't eaten yet, I really appreciated the gesture.  Anyways, I usually give a restaurant a few tries to impress me before I write my Yelp review, in case the bad experience I have is a one-off or just an off-day.  I'm pretty forgiving with food, but not so much with service, especially when you're forced to be served.  And it sounded like it was a bad night all around. My friend's reservation was double-booked and got switched for a speed dating event, there was only one server assigned to our table of 30, etc.  So thanks to Melrose, my night was salvaged, but I have to give this experience 2 stars. It would have been one, but they did give me my drink order and didn't charge me for the flatbread they never gave me (although that could be because they didn't run it in), and as I've never been before and therefore have no baseline to compare with, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that it was just a bad night for them.  I'll probably come back to try them out again in the future to see if that'll be a better experience, but probably not any time soon. Lots of choice out there, and places I know that are consistently better.  27/30"}
{"text":"Libertine was a total letdown for me. I went once for appies and drinks with a girlfriend, and we had a great time. The fried chickpeas were good, the service friendly. The salmon flatbread was alright, and I really did enjoy the dirty fries.  This time, the food was all sub par (none of us were happy with our meals), especially the duck poppers which were bland and overpriced at 11$ for 4. The flatbread was really just a pizza, and a mediocre one at that. and  Plus they had run out of a lot of things, so we had to keep changing our order.   The service was quite good both times, and the location and atmosphere is really nice.   I hope it was just a bad day in the kitchen, but it was so underwhelming that I won't rush back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went here after work with a friend for a light dinner and some drinks on the patio. It was really busy, they were having a free pig roast. We ordered the platter to share and it was not at all worth the 30$, it consisted on deep fried tater tots with fake cheese sauce, 4 old tasting dry ribs, some kale which was burn your tongue salty and 6 pieces of baked pita bread with a TIIIINY serving of salsa and some other random (strange tasting) dip. I mean does that not just SOUND like the strangest, worst platter ever?! Of course it's not described like that but that is what it boils down to.  The drinks are expensive but otherwise pretty good, except the ruby red, tastes funky with a bitter after taste. I didnt like that one at all.  This would never again be my first choice, but I would come back to give it a second chance, maybe I just chose the worst thing on the menu..."}
{"text":"Although the menu looked appealing, the execution was poor.  Suburban housewives can produce a better charcuterie board, ingredients taste like a bogo event at Safeway. Don't waste your time if you are looking for good food. Beer menu decent, service was scattered at best."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, decent selection of drinks.  The menu looked appetizing but lost something in translation to the actual dishes which were just meh.  I would come back to try the roast pig but we were here to watch the hockey game over dinner and the TVs were a bit lacking."}
{"text":"Hello Yelp readers,  I went to Libertine Public House on a Friday afternoon during lunch, being that I was trying to impress my very attractive female coworkers, I thought I would take them to a hip and happening spot on Stephen Ave. I arrived there before them to get a table and scope out the surrounds to set the groundwork for a very impressive lunch, where I would regale them with tales of my very important job (data entry), and hopefully win them over as I really do not have very many friends at work.   The atmosphere and decor of the restaurant was awesome. Nice little spot, I initially could see myself really charming my co-workers there and gaining there admiration. Everything of the bat was good, got drinks and put in our food orders, that's where it went sideways. The orders we placed took forever to come out. I was stuck there for about an hour trying to think of witty antidotes to keep these very beautiful women entertained and to my detriment I am not that charming for extended periods of time.  When the food finally did come out, my very stunning female coworkers received there food and to my dismay my order went to the completely wrong table.   The waitress which was great addressed this issue and put a rush on my food. However my witty female counterpart was not satisfied with her food, it seemed that her margarita pizza had a strange smell to it that resembled chlorine. When my handsome self finally received my order it was subpar.   The entire meal left everyone dissatisfied and left me in a state of despair which can be compared to a being without a girlfriend for a multitude of years. My shot with these goddesses was blown.  In all seriousness though, the food was not up to the level I would expect from such an establishment. However the manager was great and quite accommodating comping our meal. On a side not my coworkers still have not spoken to me."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to the Libertine and let's just say they didn't get any better since that first visit.  I originally stopped here with coworkers about 2 weeks ago for lunch since it looked like a nice place and there's been some hype since it's new.  On that visit out server seemed disinterested in us and the food was pretty bland.  I had a burger and fries, which tasted like I could have made it at home.  One coworker had the flat bread, which looked good but the other one with gluten free flat bread looked like it needed more toppings and effort.  The only good thing was that the server topped up our sodas before they were empty.  This second visit was for a friends large birthday gathering.  When I arrived the hostess had no idea what party I was talking about, so I had to find the group myself.  Turns out that my friend's original booking for 30+ people was supposed to be on the 2nd floor, but they bumped her without telling her for a speed dating event.  Well, that definitely puts a change on the evening as we were seated in the restaurant area and crammed against the wall - so, we pretty much couldn't mingle past our own table.  Again our server seemed disinterested in us and was hard to find.  She would take almost 20 minutes or more to come order drinks and it took an hour to finally get a glass of water with our food - she was smart to bring a jug, but that emptied quickly and we couldn't get another one (I guess they only want you buying drinks here).  I ordered the Sin City drink, but ended up with a completely different one... I just drank it because it took 30 mins to get the drink in the first place.  I had the fish fries to eat, which were not very tasty and literally came with potato chips on the side (not cafe chips, Lays potato chips) for a lovely price of $10, not worth it.  What was even better was that my friend, Reg T., didn't even get his dinner he ordered (we were happy it didn't end up on his bill).  He waited about an hour for it and when it just didn't show we all decided to head to another venue where we know service is always good (Melrose Cafe & Bar had a complimentary pizza waiting for Reg when we arrived because they know what good service is AND Reg was really hungry by that point!).  It did take quite some time to get our bills, but not too long to pay as there was a different girl taking payment.    In the end, I don't plan on being back again.  I don't like to waste my money on poor service and bland food.  I can pay less elsewhere for good food and pleasant service."}
{"text":"Meh. That's the best I can give on this one... Was here on a quiet Saturday afternoon, maybe they didn't have their A team in today but my boyfriend sat with an empty beer glass infront of him for twenty minutes before the server asked if he wanted another  ANd we were sitting at the bar. The stars rating is for the sangria, it's not too shabby, that -  I would have again. The place in general and the service? - pass thanks"}
{"text":"Wow, this was a shocker.   The scene looked great, busy, hip and the menu looked fun.  Sadly all potential joy was lost from the moment we placed our order.    In the spirit of a fun pub evening we ordered a pint of local crafted ale and a fun wine, which were ok.  The beer was a bit warm but flavourful.     The meal was an unfortunate waste of a nice evening out.  Cheese and meat that clearly were selected haphazardly from the bargain bin.  The flatbread was actually a soppy pizza reminiscent of a microwave ready meal.  I rarely leave eats behind, but I made an exception here.  Service was poor, 3 attempts for water to accompany our meal and drinks failed.  Very slow and inattentive.   On the way out I noticed another patron scornfully inspecting (and pushing away) the harshly cooked trout dish that was one of the signature entrees.     Likely ok for a few beers, but if a meal or food of any sort are of interest, I'd pass on this location."}
{"text":"Food is bland. Service was poor. I have been here several times and always leave feeling like I should have gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"If I was writing this review based on my first experience at the Libertine, it would likely be a 4 star and glowing review.  The service was friendly, the food excellent and my sole nitpick would have been getting charged $1.75 for a small little container of dipping sauce with my pizza. Even Panago doesn't charge for the first one of those!  In 2 subsequent visits however, Libertine has thrown away the good will earned on that first visit.  My team and I went down a few weeks ago for lunch, and to say we were disappointed and underwhelmed would be serious understatement. I was honestly embarrassed to have recommended the place.  Service was extremely slow, the food lacklustre for the prices charged, and they were out of 3 of their popular draft beers.    My last visit the other night for a friends birthday was a travesty.  I joined the festivities already in progress, and after half an hour hadn't even been asked if I wanted a drink.   Which might explain why the place seemed half empty when I initially walked up to it! Libertine needs to seriously pull it out of the fire if they want to survive in downtown Calgary.  The pizza I had a month ago was both simple and spectacular, the service friendly and attentive. If they can bring that back, they might have a chance.  But slow service is death, and slow service to a business lunch crowd is certain death squared for a restaurant of any stripe."}
{"text":"One word, terrible.  I've been to this restaurant on multiple occasions and apart from organizational events, this place is terrible. Terrible service, so bad that I think it has actually biased my thoughts on the food and the mood.   I have been meaning to write a review about this restaurant a while ago, but because of my bad experience I figured that I should give it some time. Unfortunately that hasn't changed anything. I've been there on three personal outings and wow third time is really a charm. I will never go back.   From my most recent experience, I went with a group of about six. Keep in mind that I'm not expecting much from this place considering that it is a pub and that I've had bad service in the past. But really, when you think things can't possibly be worse...they are. We had a server with no clue what was on the food menu, she was slow and inattentive. It almost seemed as though she was avoiding our table. At the end when we asked for our individual bills, she came back with them, smacked them down in the middle of the table and just walked away. The least she could do was put the effort in to give us our bills. Not only that, but the paying process was so painful...a friend actually thought of just walking out. Lucky for her we waited.  I understand that pubs and bars don't aren't necessarily about the service, but at her level it was unacceptable."}
{"text":"For starters, it's hard not to go up when you start with what was the Henry VIII Pub... which, for those who don't know, was NASTY.  Libertine is a fine addition in the 'gastropub' line of establishments so recently popular in Calgary and ranks well in the category so far dominated by players like Double Zero pizza, Local 522 and Charcut.  Food is decent upscale pub with everything you might expect but really what I love most is the location (on busy 8th Ave across from the Unicorn) and the space (airy, upscale but unpretentious...  and really everything you might expect from something in this category).  Service was good and I will of course go back.  A very nice new location in downtown."}
{"text":"As part of Big Taste Calgary, I decided to treat my sister to lunch here for her birthday.  I figured it would be busy due to Big Taste so we made reservations for 11:30, the hostess showed us to our table as soon as we arrived. We got seated in the front area, it was nice to see outside and the people starting to pile in for lunch.  Our first course was a candied fig and walnut salad and it was really good! I normally don't like goat cheese, but it was a nice pairing with the house dressing.  Next came our entree, the dirty blonde Mac and cheese with ale braised pork drumstick and the portion was quite huge! We probably could have just shared it between the two of us. The pork was so good, crispy and really flavorful. The mac & cheese was pretty bland, even after \"a-salting\" it, it still was bleh.  While we were eating and it started to get busy, huge wind gusts kept blasting into the area we were sitting from people opening and closing the door. It was pretty chilly and quite irritating - I ended up having to put my coat on. So note to those who come here, try to get a table closer to the back area away from the door if it's cold out.  When I read the dessert: chocolate chip and Bacon ice cream sandwich, I was like YES! My 3 faves mashed together: cookies, bacon and ice cream! I wish my mouth agreed. The maple ice cream was good, the bacon crusted cookies were not really good. The bacon wasn't crisp so it was kinda chewy and the cookie was quite hard - I ended up only eating part of the cookie that didn't have bacon on it :(  It was a good experience (food for the most part was delish, service was awesome), I looked up their regular menu online and there are some tasty dishes I'd like to try so I'd definitely go back"}
{"text":"Had a midday mid week lunch here. The \"damn good burger\" was damn good. And so was the service. My friends also greatly appreciated their selections - one was a special - open face roast beef sandwich and the other was some kind of a burger different than mine. They raved about their choices as much as I did with mine. I'd definitely come back for drinks or another meal."}
{"text":"The Libertine Public House is a modern gastro-pub on Stephen Avenue.  It attracts a lot of downtown clientelle due to its location.  It is a lot larger than it looks from the outside, with two full floors of seating.  We were at Libertine recently for a friend's birthday.  We had the upstairs area reserved for us, which was nice to have such a large space.  There were well over 75 people there, and the Libertine didn't have enough wait staff to handle everyone.  Even though our friend had given estimates on the number of people attending, they had only allocated 1 waitress and 1 bartender for the reserved upstairs area....  Not enough for a full floor of people.  We ended up ordering our drinks directly from the bartender.  Which was a good thing, because it turned out that the waitress was putting all the drinks ordered through her onto one bill.  If you've ever had to split a bill between a large table, you know that it can be challenging.  Imagine trying to split a bill between 50+ people, many of whom you have never met, and who are all leaving at different times.  It was pretty unorganized.  As for food, the group had pre-ordered the roasted pig along with a bunch of salads served up buffet style.  Everything was decently done.    I feel like the Libertine has the potential to be great, but they need to iron out some of their organizational issues.  Review #22 of Yelp's 30 Day Review Challenge"}
{"text":"This will be a limited review. 3 of us stopped in for a few drinks. The place was quiet at the time and the service was good. The drinks were reasonably well made and the prices on par for the area. We didn't try any of the food hence the limited review. Based on what little I experienced I would certainly give this place another try to see what a full experience brings."}
{"text":"The service was good-ish, our server disappeared a few times but overall was attentive.  The food was horrid.  From six of us at the table four things went back plus a couple of the appetizers.  The explanation was that they were transitioning in a new chef.  Plus it was super dead on a Saturday night which should have been an alarm bell for us.  Nice room but something was happening upstairs and it was super loud and slightly annoying as we were right at the bottom of them and at times couldn't hear anyone at the table talking.    I may return on a hot summer day for a beer if they have a patio but probably never for food!"}
{"text":"I'm actually embarrassed by the number of lunch reservations I make for Libertine. This one of my favorite spots on Stephen Ave because it's just the right mix of upperclass casual as a trendy pub. I've been here for everything from events (MBA party) to after-work drinks and have always enjoyed the food, venue, and service. They have a fantastic elk burger and their house salad is absolutely awesome. They have a decent patio (for the limited space available) that's great for people watching in the summer. I've never had to wait for a table here, so don't worry about waiting. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience, went there with 5 friends, half the menu wasn't available ...run out of food... Got salt and pepper chicken wings and they didn't even have RANCH!! You can't have wings without RANCH! The food that we could order was extremely band....never going back"}
{"text":"Well Saturday night, nine o' clock... where shall we go on Stephen Ave? Since we were already in a pub like mood we decided to try out Libertine! At first all was good. We got sat at a cozy little table for two and our waitress seemed fun and seasoned.  We ordered the beer paddles (three 6oz glasses of selected beer) each and wanted to have something sweet to go with it (we like our sweets!)  So when we saw this amaaaaazing looking dessert walk by us and placed on the table behind we said the famous \"we'll have what she's having\" (by the way it was in this banana spilt type bowl with ice cream on top of chocolate cake with fancy deliciousness coming out of it)  Our waitress said,\" Ok great I'll ring that up for you\" What came out was NOT what the others had it was this mini tart that was filled with chocolate and bacon... the tart was ok, but really? We didn't want that! And also she didn't explain anything about our wrong looking dessert; she basically dropped it on the table and ran away.  We did confront her about it and all she said was oh, they are on a wine tasting so they get a different menu... Could you have just said that before? Yes. Did she? No.  Overall it was loud and for the rest of the night the service was just sparse... She got real friendly when it was time to pay though which I found unsettling.   Will I come here again? Maybe.... but it would not be my choice."}
{"text":"What a difference compared to our first experience: after a visit in 2012 we gave Libertine four stars. This time they barely deserved two.  We were in a group of eight and decided to have drinks and some food after a concert. At this later time the pub was relatively empty but according to the staff they still had a bigger group upstairs.  Nevertheless there was enough staff left in the bar for the amount of people in my opinion. Anyhow our waitress was completely unable to handle our table: she didn't get the order right and had to return not once but a couple of times to double check what everyone had ordered. Then she was still bringing the wrong food and wrong drinks. The evening was a disaster.   The only thing that went pretty well was splitting the bill. Everyone got his own bill with his own stuff on it.  I would have expected a gesture from the house for the complete mess up but there was nothing.  This kind of service leaves a bad taste and it takes many good experiences to make up for one bad. Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"The Libertine is in an excellent location on Stephen Avenue. Unfortunately, that seems to only be one of it's redeeming qualities.  I was here for a birthday party. It seemed that the birthday girl had reserved upstairs, and the restaurant had double booked it with a speed-dating group. So, the reservation had been moved downstairs. It seems no one had called the birthday girl to inform her of this change or issue.  I was on Designated Driver duty that night, so I can't comment on any of the cocktails. I will state though that in many places I have been, in identifying myself as a DD I usually get drinks for free. Not here. Don't get me wrong, I have no qualms about paying for pop or coffee, but I feel this should be stated for the sake of others that might come here with a group and be a DD.  I also ordered the bacon popcorn, which was a huge disappointment. For $5, I got a small bowl of popcorn with maybe 3 tiny bits of bacon in it.   The service was a bit lacking, but in their defense the place was packed right out. However, it being a Saturday night, they should have had some extra staff on hand.  After this experience, and after reading others on here that weren't at that party, it's highly unlikely that I will ever be back."}
{"text":"Just read the FFWD review on The Libertine and I would agree their review. From Stephen Avenue, The Libertine is easy to spot with its big glass windows on the 2nd floor and large main floor patio. Inside, the ambience is trendy, warm, fun. The Libertine looks almost like an NYC warehouse with fun, antique-looking wall fixtures/ pictures. There are a few TVs above the bar only; thankfully, the volume was not ridiculously loud.  I can see why The Libertine is quickly becoming the \"place-to-be-after work-on-Stephen-Ave.\" You can sit at the bar and chat it up with the bartender or your neighbor; you can sit inside/ outside with gang of friends.  There are lots of draught beer choices (mainly from British Columbia, Ontario and Alberta) and unique share-able appetizers like the massive roasted massive bone marrow bones! Try it- it's like horse-radish meets decadent hot pate...I know, sounds weird, but it's pretty delicious! Definitely a high fat treat! I washed it all down with a flight of 3 small-pint beers for $9... There are some decently priced wines (per bottle) too.  My boyfriend had the wild boar burger and I had the soft shell crab burger. Both were flavorful with their respective sauces and seasonings. Our salads weren't boring either: Spring mix with berries, almonds and a thyme vinaigrette. I liked that the food wasn't your typical pub fare. Presentation was a little bit sloppy and my salad was missing strawberries.  Service: Friendly and knowledgeable, helpful. We had several servers help us out (appears to be a team-type approach which I like). One past experience tip: Always offer water.  Given that we went on a Saturday evening, I'm not surprised that a few (I counted at least 4) of the draught selections were not available (our waitress confirmed that Friday nights are very busy). However, what surprised me the most was that they ran out of their duck roll appetizer and pork dishes (which included a pork belly burger and flatbread). Hence, the 3 out of 5 rating... The Libertine should be better prepared and well-stocked with their popular items to keep their customers consistently happy.   Overall, I will return to The Libertine to see if they're better stocked after a Friday. Maybe we'll order a whole roasted pig for $400 (5 days notice required;-)"}
{"text":"Went to a birthday party there last night.  The birthday girl had done a walk through at the request of the venue prior to the event.  She picked out her place for about 30 plus guests upstairs and that was that... it was booked in what was supposed to be a lounge setting.    We got there Saturday evening to find that we were in the dining area which was crowded for 30 plus guests and made it hard to mingle and meet new people in our group as they had booked a speed dating event upstairs.    I checked out the menu online prior to going and was excited to see a unique menu.  I liked the facebook page and was quite excited to go to this place.  The location on Stephen avenue walk was nice.  I had good expectations.  I wasn't feeling a lot of what I saw on the menu, but found a couple things I might like to try.  Once I got there no one was there to help me find my group.  Once seated by myself I sat and waited for the waitress.  She asked me what I wanted to drink with out even ensuring I had a drink menu.  I felt rushed and ordered a beer which I did not want as she hovered over me(talk about pressure) after I finally got a cocktail menu after three attempts.  No water was poured or offered upon seating and dining out(being in the dining area and all) I kind of would expect to have water poured before even being asked my drink order.  She never offered to take an order for food.  I had to ask her to take it after about 45 mins of being there.    I ordered the menage a trois flat bread.  It was pretty good.  Pizza.  Nothing stellar or worth writing home about, but definitely edible.  I had a beer and then switched to martinis.  The Sexy Devil was very good.  I love raspberry vodka and found it going down much too easily.  Sin City was also delicious and made with blueberry vodka.  I'd have either of those drinks again... at another venue."}
{"text":"Meh...went there for drinks for my friend's birthday, when we got there we ordered water first because we wanted to wait for the rest of our party to arrive, the waitress gave us attitude for ordering WATER at a pub......  When everyone arrived, we ordered our drinks....moment later, the waitress came back and ask/confirm what we ordered.  Not only she's not very friendly nor she's very good at her job?  I am sorry, I might be a little be harsh but she needs to work on her customer service skill.  Throughout the night, she would walk around our table and randomly shout out \"drinks? Drinks anyone?\"  It got kinda annoying after awhile.    One thing I am quite impressed is they have this drink which I don't recall the name of it, but it's sweeten green tea mixed with brandy remy vsop.  I am impressed because this is the first place I came across actually has this 'cocktail'.  Although the experience I had was not the greatest, but I will go back and try out their food."}
{"text":"The mojito was very good. Not too sweet, and just right overall. It helps that it's a Thursday special!  The pork tacos were good, but they were missing something. The coleslaw and pork just didn't marry quite right. Good for a quick meal, but not much more. We also had the wings while we were out and they were okay as well. Typical wings, nothing to really write home about.  The location is awesome though! Stephan Ave is a great place to people watch. The patio makes for a great relaxing atmosphere.  The waitress was very attentive and made sure we were comfortable. Our drinks were never empty!  Come to drink and socialize and this place will go beyond your expectations."}
{"text":"In the world of cooking, eating and all that envelopes the appreciation of good food, there are those buzz words and terms that I can't stand. \"Foodie\" is one of those words. Another one is \"gastro-pub\", and though there are a lot of these so called establishments popping up recently, I really don't see why a pub that makes solid food should be given any special classification. Let's go to Libertine!  As a beer drinker, I was impressed by the craft beer menu. With all the great local choices from Calgary and beyond, it was hard to make a choice. This is where the beer paddle comes in - a handy 4 beer sampler, 24oz in total, to satisfy my curiosity. Problem solved.   The food selections are some of the standard fare you would find at a pub, like burgers and sandwiches, with a little bit of original items that add interest and variety to the whole menu. Take, for instance, the fish fries. Whole smelts battered and deep fried, served with housemade potato chips. The smelts are tasty, and are a nice mix of male and female - if you're familiar with smelts, the females are a special treat because they are chock full of tasty roe. Delicious.  The pretzels are soft and beautifully cooked. They glisten with that wonderful sheen and go well with the tasty beer mustard dip. We did see the charcuterie board pass by a couple times as we were dining, and it was very full and hearty, with generous selections of meats and cheese with fresh bread.  Service is good and attentive. I found the staff to be very knowledgable in the food and drink selections and quick to offer honest suggestions when there were questions to be asked about the menu. Call Libertine a gastro-pub if you want to. I enjoyed the food and beer, and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place... Hold one because here comes a rant... I've been going to libertine 3 Fridays a month for the past several months because its the only place on Steven Ave that typically has a patio spot after work. I usually try every other pub first but now with the unicorn closed things are limited.   I want to start first with the service because its the main reason I am writing this review. I went in the past friday and had drinks with my friend. Our first waitress was pretty good. not very talkative but at least was good about making sure we got food and drinks. The second waitress... what a cow. During the hour she was our waitress I had to go to the bar twice to get my own drink in which case I was told to ask my waitress. If I am going to the bar TWICE to ask for a drink its pretty clear my waitress doesn't exist. And yes I know its busy there but there were TWO girls standing at the front to seat people in a seat yourself pub... That's all fine and good except when it finally came time to pay for the drinks the waitress has the gull to ask me why I didn't tip her the standard 18%. Uh because you were a shitty waitress??? Tips are a gratuity not a right.   Now lets talk about their attire! This is a pub that definitely needs to implement a dress code or a uniform. There is nothing worse than having to stare at a girls Ass cheeks, barely covered breasts, or stomach hanging out when you are trying to eat or have a few casual drinks after work. I get that servers think men want to see this but as a woman I really don;t find it appropriate or sexy. I find it desperate and disgusting.  I understand its a pub but that doesn't mean you should be wearing shorts that don;t cover your ass.   I really hope the owners or manager do something about this place because I certainly won't be going back with waitresses dressed for the strip club that don;t really care about customer service. I'd skip it and eat at the Mc Donald's across the street. At least they smile when you order."}
{"text":"Review #3 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012.  Food: 2/5 Service: 2/5 Ambiance: 2/5 Overall experience: 2/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  The Libertine is not a terrible bar, but it's definitely not my top pick for a bar to drink and eat on Stephen Ave.  The Libertine is a fairly large bar with two floors, but the upstairs was closed at the time for a function. Instead my group of friends squeezed into a booth on the main floor which got really loud with the after-work crowd. I had to yell at my friends for them to hear me. I really liked the decor where their chandelier/lamp shades were of empty kegs. It has a crispy, clean \"lounge\" look than a bar with a seating arrangement similar to the District with tables close to the front, a middle section of booths, and bar tables on either side. It is fairly spacious unless you happen to sit next to a giant party who end up spilling into your area.  The service wasn't great either - the server didn't come by as often as we hoped and it took her a good 15-20min before she acknowledged our friend who joined our table mid-way through the evening. She did however make up for it by buying his drink which impressed me.  A pint (20oz) of draft beer is around $7.50 which is a hefty price tag compared to other places. Understandably, it is located in DT but their selection of draft is very 'generic'; nothing I haven't seen before. They also serve a few beer cocktails, specialty cocktails ($6.75-$8), and martinis ($9). Glasses of wine are pretty expensive at around $8-$11 a glass.   Their menu can be described as a failed attempt at creating a \"sophisticated\" bar menu. Granted they mix things up by offering unique combinations such as duck jalapeno poppers, duck clubhouse, soft shell crab, house made finger foods like olives, beer nuts, and spiced chickpeas.    My friends and I ended up sharing:  - Their new \"Hot Charcuterie Beer Board\" with house olives, a hummus dip, calamari with some sort of ranch dip, spring rolls with shredded duck, and a grilled skewer of mango wrapped in prosciutto. The calamari was lightly battered but were tiny and bland; the accompanying sauce didn't add much flavour to it either. The skewers were overly salty, and the spring rolls were soggy in the middle. The only highlight of the board were the lightly salted house olives. I DO NOT recommend this charcuterie board.  - \"Dirty Fries\" starter ($12) with pulled pork, Carolina BBQ sauce, gravy, apple slaw. Another mediocre dish that can be shared between 2-3 people. I really enjoyed the sweetness and tenderness of the pulled pork, but there wasn't enough of it to cover the fries. A fairly decent dish to try out but not a \"must-have\".  - \"Stout BBQ Chicken Marinated Chicken Flatbread\" ($14) with red onions, red peppers, mozzarella, stout BBQ sauce. The flatbread was very large and can be shared between 2-3 people. The bread was a bit chewy for my liking but the sweetness of the chicken and BBQ sauce was fantastic! Compared to the other flatbreads, I recommend getting this one for the flavour.   All in all, the Libertine is an overpriced bar on Stephen Ave with mediocre drinks, food, and service. I will not return unless I have to."}
{"text":"I wish I had known about this place sooner, as it's epic. Came here for a work function and was amazed at the food and the service. We got a huge table upstairs, as there was 12 of us and were seated promptly and ready to go.   Out of the 12 there is me, the super annoying celiac and another two that are intolerant. The server knew the menu and what was gluten free, and what substitutions could be made to make it gluten free, I went with the damn good burger, which was damn good. I was only able to eat half of it, as it was huge.   We did have a couple mix up with the other two GF peeps, in regards to the pizza. But the server was fantastic, she took the pizza away and got another one ready just to ensure it was in fact a GF pizza. The manager even came over to make sure everything was good and all our orders had been sorted out."}
{"text":"You know those people who just take a while to get to know, but when you finally do, you realize that underneath it all they really are good people. Perhaps, misunderstood at times, but with solid and honest intentions?  I'd like to introduce to you my friend Libertine, here.  It's taken us a few encounters to finally see eye to eye, but now that we have, I anticipate some seriously smooth sailing.  I've got to admit, at first I felt like they just tried a little hard. You know those people you meet and you can't help but wanting to say \"I'm sure you're alright. Just tone it down and be who you are!\" But then, they're also dating your friend and they seem to neglect the heck out of her, and you're left wondering \"WTF, mate? You've been fronting so hard, but if you want to really win me over, put some effort in where it matters.\"  The first, trying hard, part could probably be used to describe the whole Libertine feel. \"Hey, look! We made another National (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/national-calgary)! ...But with less beer and the food's not as good.\" Revolutionary stars! Also like National, but yeah, I get it. You're the Beer Revolution. Well, except that Beer Revolution already exists (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/beer-revolution-calgary-2)...  The second, not caring part could probably describe my on again/off again relationship with their servers. On again because sometimes it's A-OK, and off again because sometimes I'm not sure if they even have servers. Am I doing it wrong? Do I just go up to the bar?  So yeah, they've had their quirks, but as of late I'm seeing the consistency start to shine through. I feel like they're making a real effort and it's starting to show. On first glance they might try hard but when you get to know them, you'll see they really do care about beer culture in Calgary and bringing craft brew to the people. I really, really respect them for this.  Combine that with cask nights, pretty tasty cheap tacos and a good 8th Ave patio and you've got yourself 4-stars, Libertine.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've visited The Libertine a number of times since my first review.  I really like that you can get reservations at lunch and it's a quick meal.  But I personally would like to see a bit of a menu overhaul there - I'm getting a bit tired of their food!  I would REALLY like to see some nicer salads - a chicken cobb would be great!  I find their salads have a lot of odd ingredients - it is not exactly a healthy lifestyle-friendly restaurant!"}
{"text":"Worth checking out!  We went when they had been open only 4 days and she asked us to come back in a couple weeks when they'd ironed out the kinks. I didn't really notice any kinks though.  There were three of us and we ordered two sandwiches and flatbread. I can tell you the BBQ chicken flatbread was delicious, and my colleagues enjoyed their sandwiches. They have a bit of a beer selection here, but I'm not a beer drinker so I can't tell you if it's any good.   It's bright and open inside, so even if it's full on the patio, you don't feel relegated to the dungeon for your nightly feeding. Check it out."}
{"text":"This place gets 1 star for food and service, 4 stars for the beer selection, all in all,  3 stars is about the right rating for it. Let's start with the food. Actually, we'd better not - I would not recommend anything on their menu. Dishes are either overcooked, or greasy, or too dry, or just in general, not tasty. They will tell you they have a new menu - I heard that tale for about 2 months, and let me tell you, it's basically the same bland thing as ever.  Why, you might ask, have I kept trying the food again and again? That's because I used to come to the Pub Quiz that is held here every Tuesday. Since the quiz starts at 6:30 sharp, there is usually no time to grab a bite elsewhere, but if you do have the time, you'd be well-advised to do just that. The quiz itself, by the way, is among the worst quizzes I've participated in, but unfortunately, it's the only one in Calgary, so better that than nothing, I suppose. As for service, it is s-l-o-w. There is one good young bartender - Josh, I believe - but the rest are so-so, and if you have to rely on a waitress, you'd be waiting for a while for your drink, even on a slow night.  But the beer selection is pretty decent for Calgary, so if you just come in here to socialize and drink beer at the bar, by all means, it's not a bad spot. Just don't order any food."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to give out my first yelp-one-star here. My experience at Libertine was nothing short of a total disaster, and I had such good expectations. Such a shame to be let down like this.  We had a reservation for 30 people on a Saturday night, supposedly on the lounge floor of this place. We were totally disappointed when we arrived to find out they had double book our reso with a speeding dating event and shunted us to the restaurant side. Not the kind of night/vibe we were going for.   Anyways, we managed to look past this major slip up and try and enjoy our evening, regardless of the fact that management didn't apologize at all to the birthday girl. 30 of us sat down in a long row in the back corner. Unfortunately things just got much worse from here out. We had one server who just couldn't handle our group. To get a drink took well over 20 minutes, and was on several occasions not what one of us had ordered. From here on out, the service was just terrible; slow, inattentive, impolite, just really bad.   I had ordered the Quinoa Beet Smoked Salmon Salad, with really high hopes and it was really disappointing. There was maybe half a beat in my salad, way way way too much unwashed, half cooked quinoa, some lettuce, and no sauce. This is probably the most boring dish I've had yet. A friend of mine at the table never even got his food.  So when we all got our bills, we laughed when it wasn't even on his bill. Our server to so MIA that we didn't even have the chance to mention she forgot some food. Several other people with us complained about their food, but I'll let you read their reviews for that story.   The only thing going for this place is location. But they wont' survive in this trendy area if they don't pull up their socks. They basically lost referrals from 30 people last night. Ouch."}
{"text":"Libertine was my New Year's Eve destination this year and I have to say I'm a bit disappointed.   They opened over 30 minutes later than their advertised opening time It took 30 minutes until after we were seated for anyone to talk to us and take a drink over.   45 minutes after seating to be called to the buffet (we were some of the first at that) Our drinks were not checked on again (the server JUST had to do drinks - the buffet is self serving).   We got a refill by going up to the bartender and asking for drinks to which he said he'd tell our server to come take our order.  She was back and forth the the bar a few times until she came over to us even then.   We ordered coffee and baileys and she brought baileys in a coffee mug and told us to walk across the room (by the bar where she came from) to add the coffee - gee thanks.  One thing you notice when the mix in missing in a drink is that there definitely wasn't a full ounce in there but you can't say anything because she's long gone and won't be back for some time. *shrug* When we went to leave it took a long time - she didn't know what we'd ordered.  Then she had mixed up bills with other parties.  It was just a service gong show.   The food itself was OK.   I'm a vegetarian so I was impressed and grateful to see a quinoa and chickpea salad on the buffet along with a couple other veggie options.   Unfortunately there was little to no taste in any of the veggie food and I picked at it a bit and decided not to eat much of it.   I felt like going back into the kitchen and instructing the chief on how to make good food that also happens to contain no meat with things like spices or what not.    My finance got to enjoy the prime rib feature on the buffet but it was rare which he doesn't like and thought was very strange for a buffet but he still enjoyed his meal more than me.   Overall it left much to be desired and I'm not keen on a return trip.   Maybe it was because it was NYE but it doesn't sound like I had an isolated incident there either."}
{"text":"Libertine Public House is a lounge atmosphere with some pretty good food.  I stopped by here with a friend for lunch and we started with the calamari. The calamari was pretty good and served in a pretty large portion (great for sharing). It surprised me how quickly the calamari arrived considering how busy it was. Following the appetizer, I had a gluten free flat bread pizza. The crust was very good considering it was gluten free, and the topics were all fresh and delicious. The flat bread was quite large, so it was definitely enough food (maybe even a little too much).  If you're looking for a place on Stephen Ave with a patio and some good food, you can't go wrong with the Libertine Public House."}
{"text":"I was upstairs where the now defunct Unicorn has taken refuge. They have a reasonably decent tap line up. They also have food! I had a burger, it was a veggie burger, kind of pasty in the middle but the bits that weren't pasty were tasty! Friendly people and a friendly bartender.   They have a nice roomy area for a pool table. I'd totally come here for that! For the food... Well, maybe I'd go for the pizza next time."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the Libertine, for a friend's birthday, and it wasn't especially favourable.  The positives: - we got served our first drinks fairly efficiently after sitting down - the ladies at the front were able to show us to our party - the drinks were awesome (especially the Sexy Devil) - the hot wings were really yummy  The negatives: - food was disappointing, other than the wings; e.g. no sort of dressing on the quinoa salad, the bacon popcorn wasn't as expected... - we were originally supposed to be seated upstairs (decided beforehand by the birthday girl & the venue) but another event was booked there instead - after initial drink order, service was very poor, including waiting to get bill for 20 minutes after most of our party had left for another establishment  - one gentleman at our table didn't even get his meal - no refills on the water  Granted, I know that a party of about 30 isn't easy to serve, but they knew we were coming in well in advance. I might be back, but only if someone I know really wants to go.  (27/30)"}
{"text":"I've tried the roast pig, once, on my first visit a few months ago. The skin was crisp on the outside and the meat was moist, juicy, and flavourful. The noise level can get a bit much for in-depth conversation, so if you  need to talk with your table companion, you will have to lean in closer."}
{"text":"If I could do half stars, I would give this place another 0.5. Alas, I cannot. The fare, service and atmosphere are all too...sterile. Corporate even. Which I guess means that it fits in well with the rest of downtown. How sad.  So, in relation to other venues in the immediate area I suppose I'd have to bump them to four...read that how you will.  Not much to say otherwise that isn't immediately obvious. They have a bar. It has liquor and a tender. The waitress was courteous, and had no difficulty with my crazy-and-bizarre order of a Dark and Stormy: \"Yes, I understand your ginger beer only comes in big bottles...so sell me a big bottle, pour some of it into a glass with ice, and add a shot of dark rum to it.\"  The food is good, and the patio is very nice on a summer day.  All in all a decent place. If you are on Stephen Ave and the weather is nice, this is probably the best spot. However, f you'll be forced indoors for any reason, all the places in this area seem pretty much the same...but Libertine should not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Outstanding customer service. good food. nice atmosphere and lots of patio seating. I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Went here for an early boozy type lunch while visiting my errant husband in Calgary - I got the fondue and started with Cider, rock creek if I'm not mistaken, the fondue was delightful and great for sharing. The beer list was very extensive and the service was attentive - to be honest it reminds me of alot of the Donnelly type pubs we have here on Van - not alot of character but the service was ok.  Would I be back, mmmmmm yeah probably, but If I had a chance to go somewhere really gritty and fun like the Bear in Kilt I think I'd prefer to go there and play pool."}
{"text":"In addition to their excellent location in downtown calgary, this place is always happening and  you can always count on having a good time there."}
{"text":"Yummy ... Menage A Trois with Louisiana hot sauce! Fast, friendly service - perfect for downtown business people who need to get back to work ..."}
{"text":"If I had stayed at a table on my recent late afternoon/early evening visit to The Libertine, I'm not sure that they would've received a 4 star rating. I walked in and asked on of the servers if I should just seat myself \"Yeah, sure,\" came the reply as she walked on by. I sat down and proceeded to wait for her or one of the others to come by. No such luck. The front half of the resto was busy-ish, the back half was completely empty. I admit I was a little tucked away, but still, wouldn't the one I asked think to come my way? Not before I bailed on the table idea and headed towards the wood where I had much better luck!  One of the bartenders (I think his name was Cory?) was in front of me immediately with a drink list and helping me decide what it was I wanted to sample. He actually did give me a couple of samples before I settled on a Lemon Tea beer from Mill Street. Delish! Great choice :). I also enjoyed that the taps were mounted on the wall.  The Libertine was also hosting the first of their swig and swine Thursday nights. Pig roast and drink specials on the 2nd floor. I was on my way out after sampling some of that when I ran into an old frisbee playing friend I hadn't seen in a good year or so. A twist of my rubber arm convinced me to join them for one more drink... I had to be home by 7 after all.  Well, a beer or two and a jerk chicken sandwich later, I was still there. At first I ordered the jerk chicken, then I was told it was out, so I went for a lamb burger. As I was looking forward to my lamb burger, the jerk chicken sandwich showed up, \"Turns out we were out after all!\" said the server. I love when mixups result in me getting what I wanted in the first place :).  I was impressed that it was pretty easy to hear my cohorts speak without having to lean in too far to hear them. The Libertine and I may have another run in sometime soon. And I think I'm sticking to the wood."}
{"text":"Awesome craft beer selection. I had a wild time trying to decide what to try, being from Toronto none of the beers were familiar to me. Finally I decided on a West Coast cider which was quite delicious.  The food were was very meh. The menu sounded good - lots of unusual burgers/sandwiches with interesting ingredients. Some pizzas and some salads. But all the food we ordered was sort of bland and not very exciting. My friend's Mediterranean pizza was quite cardboard-like. I tried the jerk chicken salad - it was okay but the chicken was completely bland and had no seasoning nor taste, I had to get the salt shaker out. Other friend's burger and fries were also quite mediocre.  When we first arrived we were seated inside (patio was full) and had a really grumpy waitress who failed to even mention to us that it was happy hour and that all draft beers were reduced prices. We were shortly after moved to the patio and our second server was much better."}
{"text":"Stopped for a late lunch following the Pride parade and got an outdoor table to watch the parade aftermath. It was a fun scene. The duck confit club sandwich I ordered was very good and the bread was incredibly fresh. My partner's grilled salmon sandwich was very well spiced with good flavor though it could have been cooked a bit less. The server was friendly and attentive. We liked this place!  August 2014"}
{"text":"2 words - Roast Pig!    We had our group lunch at Libertine today and our VP ordered the roast pig for our lunch.  It came with an apple coleslaw and a green salad with eggs, raspberries and sundried tomatoes, hot vegetables, fingerling potatoes and of course, roast pig!  The whole pig sat on the buffet table waiting for us.  Soon, it was cut up by the chef and we picked up our food buffet style.  The roast pig was tender and moist and the skin nice and crispy.  Reminds me of the Chinese \"siu yoke\" roast pig.    The liqour was ever-flowing.  Beer, beer and more beer.    It's still like a pub; the food is OK and not outstanding.  I don't see myself coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"libertine [lib-er-teen, -tin]   Noun. 1.A free thinker 2.A person who is morally, and socially unrestrained   Let me lay it all out:  Our friend is new to Calgay so we wanted to give him a fun Saturday.  Insert Downtown Adventure!  Ending the day we wanted to grab a cold beer -  We just started walking down Stephen Ave ... then it started raining ... and we had a dog.  Insert Mad Dash to closest patio.  Welcome to Libertine.  Once we hooked our poochie up & gave her water we all got settled at our table. After waiting about 10 minutes a less then enthustic waitress came and took our beverage order. My husband and our friend both  ordered pints and I asked for a glass fo water with lemon. She looked at me like I had six heads .... After an awkard pause she even asked me to repeat what I had asked for.   Maybe its because Im from Saint John, NB but where I come from waitresses are humble, nice and do anything to give the customer a great expierence. Because in the end, we are the reason you have a job. Our waitess acted like we were bothering her - to get a refil on my water my husband had to walk up to the bar with my glass ... All this and we havent even ordered yet.  Then we ordered. I was excited, the menu was small but had a lot of things we were excited to try.  We started off with QUESO FUNDIDO. So umimpressed. I was so excited for the creamy 4 cheese sauce - but when it got to our table it was watery and cold. Maybe im not cool enought to get the \"unique food\" thing .. but I thought it would have been so much better warm and made with more cheese, i feel like to help cut cost they cut out real cheese. Also, it says it comes with salsa frecso (i think that means salsa ..) and ours came with none. Would have loved to tell this to our waitress but she didnt come back. The corn chips were normal ... I was thinking maybe homemade, but no - out of the bag served with cheese sauce in a cast iron frying pan. WHY THE PAN IF YOUR NOT GOING TO USE IT lol They focus all their energy on making the menu they forget about the follow throug   Ive worked at many chain restaurants and the number one rule is \"2 bite check back\" . I hate to admit it, but if a huge chain like Pizza Hut can get it together to check on their guests, a fancy place like the public house could. Especially when there were only a handful of people. I would have loved to ask for it to be heated up, or if it was supposed to be served that way or if i could please get some salsa fresco, whatever that means (was stoked to learn from my waitress though)  My husband and our friend wanted to try the duck poppers but after being almost told no by our waitess, did not.   Honestly, we just wanted to get out of there. And it was apparent that our waitess also wanted us out of there.  I heard from a friend you can find really good vegan treats here - thumbs up to the $5 fried chickpeas! - only I didnt get to try it because our waitress hated us.   I felt terrible this was Connors (our friends) first restaurant expierence in Calgary. Especially after we gloat about what a fun expierence Stephen Ave can be and how fun the waitesses are.  Will not be going back. Will not take anymore friends there.  Oh, and words of wisdom to our waitress: Pull the stick out of your ass."}
{"text":"The location is great if you are downtown and want a bite to eat  before an event.  We ordered the steak sandwich with a salad and some craft beers.    The steak sandwich was $17.00 which isn't too bad; however the portion was a bit small for that price.   The garlic sauce on the bread was to die for, and left me wanting to order a whole other steak sandwich!     The server was polite, and fun to talk with, and overall we had a nice experience here.  I will forever be craving the sauce on the steak sandwich though!"}
