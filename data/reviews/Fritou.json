{"text":"This place is awful. They gave me rock hard chicken that has been sitting out forever. The gravy and fries where too salty to eat. And when i asked for fresh chicken the cook offered to give me a chicken wing in replacement for the almost $15 dollars worth of food i ordered. Thanks but no thanks. Dont go here there are places that treat you better and take pride in thier food. The owner should realize the importance of customer service if he/she wants to stay in business."}
{"text":"Their fried chicken sandwich was delicious! The service can be a bit slow but the food is always pretty good. I think they are starting to do features because a friend was eating some other dishes not typically on the menus like goat curry and roasted chicken!"}
{"text":"Is there such thing a fried chicken connoisseur? If so, I think I'm becoming one!

We arrived after lunch to order take out and the place was quite empty. However, we were in and out pretty quick. With a 3 piece meal (which came with fries, gravy and coleslaw for $13) and a popcorn chicken combo (that also came with fries and a pop for $15) in hand, we trekked back to our office. 

Nothing could have prepared me for the delicious chicken we were about to devour. It was so moist! They marinate their chicken for 18 hours, lightly bread it and fry it in sunflower oil that gives it all the flavour and extra crunch. Sooooooooo good!

I'd definitely add Fritou to my list of best Calgary chicken places, I think you'll agree if you try it too!"}
{"text":"I walked in there at 3pm looking for a quick lunch to go,  and this place was great. The chicken strips were hot and juicy,  and the fries were fresh. I waited about 5-10 minutes for my food, which was fine for me. All in all, great experience."}
{"text":"The chicken is really nice but never never try the waffles, those are really really bad"}
{"text":"I passed this place awhile back and saw the sign \"Chicken and Waffles\".  Knew I needed to go back, and I am very happy I did.  The chicken is crispy and the batter is very flavorful.  Waffles are fluffy and just the right texture, with just a hint of sweetness.  Comes with a small container of syrup if you want to sweeten up the waffle.  Place was clean, lots of comfortable seating, service was friendly and fast.  No complaints.  It's two blocks from my office - bad news for me as I will definitely be back for their chicken (for sure) and fries, and I foresee some weight gain.  Lesson learned though - while I was waiting for the waffle to cook through, another customer phoned in their order for two orders of chicken and waffles.  That's what I will do next time."}
{"text":"Great chicken items!! We got wings, sandwiches, fried chicken and the General Tao. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Dead at lunch hour rush,  chicken was gross and fries soggy,  tried a bite and threw it away.  Chef was annoyed that he actually had to do any work."}
{"text":"I have had Fritou Fried Chicken a few times before but Now that A Fritou is open in downtown, I will go more often. I love the freshness of fritou fried chicken, they make it fresh with its coating and spices, then deep fried. It's always a ten to fifteen minute wait but worth every minute of it! It's more pricey than other fried chicken but you are guaranteed the quality is worth it. I usually get the biggest family combo, but I see that they offer small combos, and at this location they offer other chicken items as well, a must try, I don't eat fried chicken often but when I do, it's fritou, and always will be!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place for a quick bite to eat when I rounded the corner and saw Fritou. I've passed by many times wondering what the food's like. I was going to order the 2 piece with coleslaw and fries and asked the man behind the counter to leave out the coleslaw. He, kindly recommended, the snack pack with 2 pieces, fries and a drink instead. I went with his suggestion and saved $2!

I didn't have to wait long for my order to be ready. The batter on the chicken was nice and crispy and well seasoned. The chicken was juicy and not dry at all. However, I didn't like the fries."}
{"text":"3pm random hunger hit me in the office the other day, but I had left my wallet at home and could only scrounge up $3 + change in my desk drawers. Hit the streets to see what I could find (didn't want to walk too far, it was pouring rain) and ducked in here.
I had enough for small fries. They were delicious. Crisp, piping hot. Restaurant was clean. Service was ok, but the counter chick just talked across the restaurant to her friend who was sitting in there the e n t i r e time. So I got to hear all about the heartbreak he (the friend) was going through. Poor guy. I'm sure the gloomy day didn't help"}
