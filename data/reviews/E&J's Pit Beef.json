{"text":"The lunch special is great! Love the pork bbq sandwich. The sauce that comes on it has a little kick, but just right! For the price it's one of the best deals you can find for lunch. The guys that run the place are top notch! Very friendly and customer service oriented. This is a place I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Hands down just like they make them from Baltimore.My sandwich was excellent.I should have ordered 2.I'll be back every Saturday!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight to try out the pit beef and the hush puppies.  This place is adjacent to the gas station at the elbow where Business 21 turns into 160.  The place was empty save for the gentleman in front of me ordering.

The menu is fairly basic.  Pit beef/turkey/pork, quarter and whole chickens and ribs.  I can't recall all the sides, but nothing stood out.  Pop is the man behind the counter taking your orders and preparing your food.  This is all good and well, except this is not quite a one-man operation.  After Pop took my order (regular pit beef sandwich and a small side of hush puppies to go), he told the next customer he would be with them in a bit and proceeded to dress my sandwich, slice the beef, drop the puppies in the fryer, put my sandwich together and then pull out the puppies.  This is all good and well when there are one or two people in line, but if you have someone with a big order or you get three or four people in line, you should expect to wait.

To the food.  It was good.  I was a little bummed that he put mayo on the sandwich (horseradish comes on it as well, but I had him hold that).  There was a good bit of beef on the regular sandwich which was nice (considering you're paying $5.95).  The onions added a nice flavor and you have your choice of additional sauces in the dining room area.  I'm sad to say that the puppies were frozen and were nothing special.

Pop is a really nice guy and I'll come back to try the turkey.  Hopefully as business picks up, he'll be able to bring someone on to help him out a bit so he can rock out in the kitchen, while someone else waits on the customers."}
