{"text":"Exclusive club underneath the stadium.  Very nice with great service."}
{"text":"We love going to the Audi Quattro Lounge. They have a great chefs table. They don't have a lot of items in the menu and the only gluten free item are the street tacos. The chef's table does have some gluten free items but they are not listed so you have to ask. I did ask them to put a GF on the labels. We will see if it helped at all 

You only get access if you have home plate or dugout box seats. If you go right when the gates open there's usually plenty of seating. If you wait until closer to game start time it can be difficult to find seating. 

It's definitely worth checking out if you have access. It's also really cool to walk around down there and see the players walking around. It's quite the fan experience."}
{"text":"This place is nothing but amazing.  Access is only for club seats down the first and third base line.  Crazy how I didn't know about this early,  if you haven't been here you need to check it out. 

From your seats you can go down to the bar and easy access to the bathrooms instead of climbing all the way up the stairs.  You get an all you can eat buffet for 40 a person which is worth it.  Plus you get to walk around the underground area of the stadium passing both locker rooms and batting cages. 

You get to walk from one end of the stadium to they other. I really don't want to see a game any other way such a great experience."}
