{"text":"I am so sorry that I didn't take a picture of the cheese enchilada that was served to us. It was the sorriest enchilada I have ever seen. Maybe a quarter of an inch thick, with cheap cheese that melted into liquid grease. 100% unappetizing, and they wanted to charge three dollars for a single one. No sides or anything.  Meanwhile I got their Thursday $5 special, the carne asada. It at least had a proper portion size. But the meat was chewy and tasted almost old. Beans tasted pretty good, but rice was very mediocre. The waitress insisted that everything is fresh and they go to the market every morning for supplies. If that's the case, then they've figured out how to take fresh ingredients and capture that mysterious and elusive 'slightly outdated' flavor that's so hard to achieve with fresh food. I only managed two or three bites before giving up.  The chips were alright but nothing amazing. We got two rounds of them, and the second round tasted fresher than the first. Salsa was alright-ish but lacked sophistication, and had a slight burn in the back of the throat that managed to drag on and on. Top this off with the water tasting either like tap or like their filter had gone out. We both drank from my tea, just to mask the dubiousness.  So far this is completely in 'Eek!' territory, so why 2 stars instead of 1? The waitress that day was great. But she's apparently one of the bartenders and was just covering for the Maribel's staff today while they were short. She was extremely understanding, and took off both the terrible enchilada and the disappointing carne asada. We left without being charged, but we still happily left a tip.  And really, there were other patrons here who seemed to be quite happy with what they were getting, so I'm very confused about how lousy this was for us. I remember reading over these yelp reviews and wondering how you end up seeing a bunch of 4 and 5 star ratings and then an intermittent 1 or 2. I've definitely had a 1 or 2 experience today. Not sure if I'll ever return to try for a 4 or 5."}
{"text":"You know, this place really sticks out among Mexican restaurants. For one, the food is fresh, and entirely handmade. Second, it is tasty! Their salsas and sauces are fantastically spicy and smoky.   Not many of their dishes are vegetarian friendly as written, but they made the special point of telling us that they would do as much as possible to accommodate us, and essentially made us entirely new dishes.   Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a great, family-owned restaurant. It's small but the staff is very friendly. Ask for Osiris. She will take great care of you! The head chef is from Mexico City and doesn't believe in boxed products so she makes everything fresh. The salsa and green chile sauce were nice and spicy. My wife and I are very picky and we enjoyed everything we ate there. If you want to support small businesses, give this place a try. The prices are more than reasonable and they have a special meal everyday."}
{"text":"Came here because of all these great reviews. Sadly it didn't live up to expectations. Our server was about 12 years old, he was nice but didn't write down our order so of course the food wasn't right. Had to ask for refills numerous times. Fish tacos were okay. No salsa/sauce of any kind offered for tacos."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying...I am Mexican.  The food was pretty good.  Homemade chips, taco shells.  The Mexican rice which is my specialty had flavor, which is rare for Mexican restaurants.  Reasonably priced, kid friendly and there were things on the menu for those family members that don't like Mexican.  A family of 4 ate for 24.00 including drinks.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  Great little Mexican restaurant inside Doc Holidays.  They have a daily special for only $5 that includes a drink.  Food has great flavor and the service is good!   Even after being away since June, the owner recognized us!  That is great customer service :)!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Las Vegas for a rugby tournament.  After the tournament ended,  we decided to grab some dinner before we made are way back home. We found this place by accident, and the food blow our minds it was so good, service was excellent."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff...tacos were excellent and the elotes was wonderful. We sat outside and the owner/manager brought us our dinner while we waited with our puppy. We will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Things I've tried so far: Carne asada tacos, fish tacos, chicken quesadilla, guacamole.   Things I like so far: Carne asada tacos, fish tacos, chicken quesadilla, guacamole.   I forgot how much I like the chips here too. I swear I make them a meal in themselves. But all in all, still really happy with Maribel's."}
{"text":"We love this place! Everything on the menu is great! The homemade guacamole and pico de  gallo  are delicious. I particularly love the shrimp enchiladas in red sauce. Their presentation of the food is also very nice and well thought out. The young waiter and waitress are very attentive and personable. And the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I went here BC of the reviews.  I don't understand the 4-5 stars When I first walked in to the simi large open and cold room there was one couple at a small table. I wanted to leave as it should have been crowded at dinner time with great reviews. It was like sitting in an enclosed patio, Zero atmosphere. We gave it a try and found the 5 start guacamole GREAT! I usually judge a mexican restaurant by the salsa. This was thin, no flavor and just spice hot. I did finish the salsa and chips though because I went for the $5 special and the two little enchiladas may have been enough for lunch but not dinner. The food was \"okay\"  but nothing to rave about. The young girl that waited on us was obviously a family member which is fine and she was very nice but no training.  My opinion; \"We can cook Mex food, let's open a restaurant and have all our friends and family give us 5 stars\".  Very disappointed, we should have great Mex food in Las Vegas but, I'm still looking."}
{"text":"Great chips and guacamole. Thursday's special burrito was hearty but only filled with steak, no rice, guacamole and sour cream. Can't beat $5 special though. Shrimp fajitas ($15) were great. They didn't skimp on the shrimp at all. The churro arrived hot and was delicious.   The demerit for stars is also because of its odd location in the lobby inside Doc Holidays. We did notice regulars come in who were greeted by their first nes, which was nice. We'll definitely be back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing meal. The location is a little weird but the food was fantastic. We ordered mostly tacos. I tried the chicken, shrimp, fish and carne asada tacos and my husband tried the shredded beef and carne asada tacos and they were all delicious. The corn tortillas were so soft they were like pillows unlike the dry sorta chewy ones some restaurants use. The beans to dip the tortilla chips in were so good that my 2 young kids just devoured them. The prices were also something we were super impressed with. We ordered 9 tacos, carne asada nachos, kids quesadilla and fries and drinks and it was only $37. The service was great even though our server was a little young. He was on point and on top of everything, better than many other servers I have encountered. I can see myself craving this place and we will definitely without a doubt be back again."}
{"text":"I love the food, fresh and always hot. Price reasonable and they have daily special price for $5. I love the service. They listen and learn for making more good service and food. Will come back again and again."}
{"text":"First time at Maribel's and definitly not my last!!  I had the Tuesday special, street tacos w/ rice & beans ! It hit the spot..."}
{"text":"Seriously bomb. Great lunch specials. The best guacamole I've ever had in my life! Eat here a few times per week for lunch."}
{"text":"So we got something that was not on the menu...recommended by very personable server named Osiris!  It was absolutely delicious, one suggestion put beans on the plate. We have been here a few times and have not ever been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delicious agreed beef tacos, authentic sauces, and 5 dollar daily specials, open 10 to 8."}
{"text":"As many know who live in Las Vegas restaurants come and go.  I am always hesitant to try out a new place especially one that is not a franchise.  After many months of passing by this place with it's one banner and little sign at the door and reading previous reviews, I decided to try it out.  Wow!!! Yum!! What they lack in atmosphere they make up for in service and food.  The waitress is one of the kindest I've ever had.  She's not afraid to suggest one of their better options, though it's all good, she didn't disappoint.  The chips, salsa and guac are delicious and fresh and they do free refills of chips and salsa!  The specials are unbeatable only $5.  I recently had the Chicken Enchiladas which were filling.  I also had a churro for dessert which was better than Disneyland!!  For three people the bill was ONLY about $20!!! I will be going back tonight to try their other appetizers and entrees :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Small family owned. It's inside the same building as Doc Holiday's, bar is to the right, Maribel's to the Left. We have lived in Vegas for 4 years (Texas and Arizona transplants) and haven't found a Really Good Mexican food joint. This is it! It's very small, but everything is made fresh by \"Mom and Dad\" every day. I had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, he had Carne Asada. Both were so fresh and delicious. The chips and salsa...Yum. Then I tried the Guacamole...That is some amazing guac, like the kind you could just eat by itself. Next time I will be ordering that with our chips and salsa. If I could have given it more than 5 stars I would have. There was nothing about our meal we didn't rave over. The service is awesome and he made sure to make good recommendations for our next visit. We found our new Vegas Mexican Food restaurant."}
{"text":"Surprisingly very good. Their prices are great and the food is simple but that's how Mexican food should be. I don't need all the cheese and they do it just right. I recommend la tampiqueña and their tacos are flavorful. Their meat actually has flavor unlike other places that drench it in sauce and hope you can't tell the difference. A great choice when you want good food at a great price."}
{"text":"I have been here three times now:  First time I had the carne Assad tacos, they were good and very filling  Second time I had the tilapia tacos, they were very good and also filling  The third time today I had the shredded beef burrito which I usually do not like, it was very good and filling  I must add that I am a 200 pound guy with a big appetite   All of the above come with rice, beans, chips, salsa and a drink for a total price of 5$."}
{"text":"Very Good Mexican food with great pricing. It is not the fanciest place to have Mexican Food but it is very good. I recommend the Green Chili Pork Plate and the Guacamole which is made fresh when you order it.  Since the food is made to order, if you are in a hurry call and order before you go. If not, sit back and relax the service is always friendly and it is quiet enough to visit with friends or family."}
{"text":"Moved to Vegas from Sacramento and hadn't found a good Mexican restaurant until eating here excellent food very authentic will be back real soon."}
{"text":"I get take out from here every so often. Great consistency and value. I'm not a fan of how the dining room is set up, however, this has not been an issue since I have only ordered to go."}
{"text":"We had lunch today what a hidden gem... All ingredients are fresh,  family run and great tasting..... Do not let the ambiance fool you,  it's nothing fancy but the food is the best around and a great price..."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Owner is great! He'll be happy to accommodate dietary restrictions! I had fantastic veggie fajitas with corn tortillas. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try a different place for Mexican food.  Casual and friendly.  $5 special was very tasty and good, plentiful. A different special every day for just $5 with rice and beans!  My husband had carnitas and he ate it all, enjoying every bite.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews I thought we would give this place a try. Sadly this might be one of the worst places I have ever eaten.....or should I say tried to eat.   The waiter was very friendly but I am pretty sure he could not have been over 11 years old.  We ordered the Saturday special. Shredded beef enchilada with beans and rice. The friendly waiter brought us chips and salsa, but the salsa tasted like it came right out of a can. It was horrible! The chips tasted days and days old.   Our enchilada plates were even worse. I could not eat more than 2 bites before I had to spit out my attempted 3rd bite. It was not good at all. The beans tasted burnt and the rice had an odd spice I have never tasted in mexican food.   Sadly we left out plates after those 2 bites and left the restaurant.   We left 15 dollars to cover our meals and a good tip for the wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too young waiter.  Unfortunately I do not see how this place can stay in business. ..."}
{"text":"Been frequenting this place weekly now for about 2 months. $5 daily specials can't be beat! Food is authentic Mexican style and very flavorful. Service is very good. Come hungry as portions are BIG! (Even with the $5 specials) I've recommended a few friends here and they enjoy it as well."}
{"text":"Holy crap, the worst Mexican good I've ever had. The shredded beef enchilada meat was flavorless and soggy. Rice and beans had little flavor. Yuck. Their salsa was like water with a little red pepper in it. I don't know what kind of Mexican food this is suppose to be but I wouldn't feed it to my dogs."}
{"text":"Just ate the best enchiladas of my life, with rice and beans, both red and green sauces were expertly prepared. the red sauce was rich dark just a little bit sweet. The green tangy just the right amount of tomatillio.  The thing that I can't believe as my meal which included enchiladas rice beans and a drink is $5.  My companion had a perfectly crafted Margarita, our meal also included chips and salsa. I  have never been disappointed. Homemade chips warm and crispy,  it is a hidden gem located in the target shopping center  Silverado and eastern  right next to the doc holidays."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, friendly atmosphere. Guacamole is AMAZING. I went on a Saturday and had the $5 beef burrito special. It was tasty! The waiter is adorable and polite. They even have pool tables. Will be coming back many times in the future."}
{"text":"When you walk in the restaurant, it is plain and there isn't so much to see. BUT, I ordered carry out and the kid who took my order is so polite and smart since he remembers all my order without writing it down. And I ordered quite a few... Shrimp tacos, fish tacos, beef nachos, chicken enchilada, guacamole, and carne Asada tacos. They're all DELISh! You can taste the freshness of their food and made to order since I waited for awhile for my orders. I'm very particular when it comes to freshness of the food since I love to cook myself and I take serious on criticizing each dish.  Even their chips looks like they just fry them. Good amount of sauce on their enchilada and the guacamole is so creamy and tasty. All in all, I'm very satisfied with their food. Definitely a place you should try."}
{"text":"This place has great specials each day. I was here in a Tuesday so the special was only $5 for 3 carne asada tacos, beans and rice. The tacos were very good and so were the beans. I'm not a huge rice guy but maybe white rice from time to time so I didn't try the rice here. I will next time ask for extra beans. Not their fault it's just my own preference. The server was nice and checked on us often. She brought us some complimentary chips and salsa and the salsa had a slight heat to it and good flavor. My wife had a side of chips and guacamole and liked it a lot along with her carne asada tacos. I can't believe we got all the food we did for what it cost. I just wish they were closer to my side of town however when I am in the area and hungry I will stop by."}
{"text":"Authentic, made to order, fresh ingredients, the daily special deals are a steal, the family that runs this place are genuine nice, hard working people. In a nutshell this place is the real deal.  Ever since we moved to Vegas there's been very few Mexican restaurants I've been impressed with. Had this place bookmarked after I read Kathy R.'s review couple months ago. Even with the stellar ratings, reviews and hype from trusted Yelpers Matt, Jaime and Emily, I still wasnt in any hurry or had the urgent need to check out this place. Things sure did change though after my first visit here.  The complementary chips and salsa - chips warm,fresh and salsa IS HOMEMADE. Love how it's blended to a smooth consistency.   The shredded beef burritos, my personal favorite!  Comes PACKED with shredded seasoned beef that's juicy. Requested mine wet with green sauce,   Rice and beans - What I really like about it is it's not greasy!   Portions were satisfying for both Mr. B and I. One of my friends thought it was not enough beans and rice for them. I pointed out rice and beans are fillers! Hello!!  What's important your main entree is not skimpy servings.   The restaurant resides inside the Doc Holidays building. There's banner signs in red and green that wrap around the building and signs advertising $5 daily specials. It's hard not to miss. You walk in side it's sectioned off from the bar. So not too much cigarette smoke escapes into the restaurant side.  You walk in there and the server will greet you and tell you to sit anywhere you want.    It's family friendly.  Clean and super casual, like a big family dining room complete with pool and game table right in the dining area!  Service. I'll just say I came away so impressed with how our young but very mature,intelligent and confident young man handled himself for his age. Our first time there, Sam didnt miss a beat. Got our orders right, our drinks refilled, offered some great suggestions.    I've brought several friends here and already they are repeat customers and is spreading the word. Maribel,  better get ready to add more tables!"}
{"text":"Weird location, inside a sports bar.  Anyways, my cousin and I got there at around 12 on Sunday. It was empty except for two workers. We ordered chips & guac, carne asada tacos, and carne asada fries. Everything needed more salt except for their salsa. Their guacamole is made fresh but still under seasoned. I was disappointed because I expected more from such a highly rated place on Yelp. It tasted mediocre."}
{"text":"8/23/14. Yea!! We went back and they are open.. The Owner talked with us and they had an Emergency. Im glad they are still here! I tried the Green Chili Plate that has Pork, rice, beans and Flour tortilla. It was Delicious!! My husband had the Carne Asada Tacos and Bean and Cheese burritos. Loved it!! Cant get enough of this place we will be back. They may be small But they know how  to Cook Mexican Food and the Customer Service is Fantastic!!"}
{"text":"This may be the sweetest family owned restaurant I've ever come across. I love their kids, they are so kind and you can tell they try very hard to make guests feel welcome. I adore their ceviche and guacamole. They are excellently priced. I can't say enough good things!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this place is a hidden gem! A friend and I were searching Yelp for some good Mexican food around the south Eastern area when we stumbled across this place, checked some reviews, peeped at some food pics and took the plunge! The chips to begin the meal at almost all restaurants can't hold a candle to these chips, they tasted so fresh like they had just fried up some corn tortilla's and delivered them to our table with some very good salsa. We ordered the fries with shredded beef and cheese as an appetizer. They were so good, fries were cooked perfect and had bunches of cheese and beef. My friend likes onions and I don't, so they actually made pico with no onions separately for me, that was way cool. We both ordered the three Carne Asada tacos combo, they come with pico, cilantro and limes, once again they hooked me up with onion less pico!! These taco's are a little slice of heaven, small but so full of flavor. Service was excellent, and staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"$5 lunch specials every day, all day long. You can't beat that. Small restaurant attached to Doc Hollidays. It is still family and kid friendly (they do have a kids menu). Good food, delicious salsas and great service. I do hope they succeed. I will definitely be back for another one of those $5 deals!!"}
{"text":"My family and I spotted this place while shopping at Michael's in the Target shopping center and decided to give it a try.  We were initially hesitant that the restaurant was connected to the Doc Holliday's bar, but there was a banner that stated that it was \"family friendly.\"  We walked into the place and found an almost empty room with scattered tables and chairs and a few booths along the wall.  The table that had people was occupied by three kids (pre-teen, early teens) one of whom got up immediately and grabbed menus to present to us.  Honestly, we were just about the turn right around and go somewhere else but felt bad because the kid seemed eager.  We decided to give it a try anyway.  The teen (who I will refer to as our waiter) asked about our drink orders and placed a basket of chips and salsa at our table.  The menu was very small and nothing really caught our attention.  My wife had the fajitas, my daughter the chicken strips and I decided to order the carne asada nachos.  The chips and salsa weren't bad - only needed a touch of salt.  While we were waiting for our food, I decided to look up the Yelp reviews and was shocked to see so many 4 and 5 stars!  This gave us hope that maybe looks can be deceiving and we shouldn't judge a book by its cover.  Our food came and the fajitas were sizzling and my nachos and daughter's chicken strips were hot and freshly prepared.  Overall, the food was not bad - just a little bland.  The reason for the 2 stars - 1) decor and ambiance is severely lacking!  The tables and chairs were run down and the pool table and Galaga video game in the corner added to the confusion of the place.  The fact that the restaurant sits at the entrance of the bar was a little distasteful.  Every time a bar patron needed to use the restroom, they would have to walk through the restaurant.  My wife's fajitas got compliments at least three times by people on their way to the bathroom.  2) pricing - we visited the place on Saturday, so no specials.  The fajitas were $13, nachos $8 and kids meal $4.  Neither my meal nor my wife's were up to par with these price levels.  Again, the food was not bad, just not worth the price we paid.  Perhaps if we had the $5 specials others have mentioned it would have been better.  I will say that the kid who served us was very nice and professional and we had no problems with service.  Obviously a family business and the owners should be proud of this kid!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars  A couple of my coworkers suggested picking up Maribel's for lunch. The idea of paying $5 for lunch appealed to me, so I tagged along. Maribel's is attached to a bar, and has a weird setup. There's about 6 tables, a pool table and a couple of TVs. No hostess station or anything like that.. just a big open room. The daily special was fish tacos, which I am not a fan of, so I settled on a bean and cheese and split half of chicken quesadilla. My party (6 ppl) was the only party in the restaurant and it took about 20-30 mins for us to receive our food, which is a bit of a bummer. They probably aren't used to the volume. They did give us free chips and salsa though, which was really good! The bean burrito was comparable to a Taco Bell burrito as was the chicken quesadilla. Nothing special. The server was nice and friendly. I probably wouldn't go back when there are better alternatives, like Roberto's, with much faster service. I will say this place would be super handy if you got wasted at the bar next door."}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa, great deals with their $5 daily specials, and great service. We'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"The guacamole is delicious and the staff is super sweet. Love the specials! I'd go here all the time."}
{"text":"If I had been alone eating here I probably would have rated Maribel's 5 stars. However, my wife's order was fair to partly cloudy at best, probably worth 3 stars, so I'll meet in the middle with a 4 star review.  Let's start with the service - our waitress was outstanding. She was attentive and gave some recommendations and also informed us of the specials throughout the week. Definitely trying to make sure we come back - which I totally appreciate. However, we placed our order when there was only one other table seated, and it took a good 35-40 minutes to get our food after we placed our order. The waitress apologized several times and even brought us a complimentary churro to apologize. The churro was outstanding. One review compared it to Disneyland churros. While I appreciate them recognizing Disney churro's as the greatest in the land, this one wasn't quite that good.  So for my entree I was simple, bean & cheese burrito. It was only $3 so I figured I'd take a stab. OUTSTANDING! Beans were really good, probably could have used a little more cheese. And they have Dr. Pepper, nothing goes better with Mexican food than an ice cold Dr. Pepper in my opinion. My wife ordered 2 cheese enchiladas, one with green sauce the other with red sauce. The green sauce was average, neither of us cared for the red sauce. They were also very, very small. I know she wouldn't order it again and I wouldn't venture out to try it - but I am interested in the carne asada which the waitress said was very good.  I'm always game for a top notch bean & cheese burrito - I just hope this restaurant isn't a one trick pony because good Mexican restaurants in this city are few and far between."}
{"text":"Slower than tar service but I tell ya what the food and the price was worth it. Fix your service issues and I will return a whole heck of a lot more I assure you."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place based on the previous 1 review only yelpers but I went for it. Is it the most authentic Mexican food I ever had? NO. Was it the best Mexican food is Las Vegas? NO. Would it serve a purpose after drinking at the bar it's located in? YES. I wish I could of enjoyed the food more. The server was very friendly and the prices were fantastic. Sadly it just wasn't great tasting food."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical seeing that it was next to a bar. But I am glad I tried it and I will be back. The decor is very humble, but ideal for the restaurant. Ozzie was very attentive and friendly. She knew the menu and had great advice. I had the three tacos plate, fish, carne asada and chicken. Glad they do not serve a fish taco..aka..fish stick taco, very tasty fish. Beans and rice were perfect...just wish I had one more serving spoon full of both. My wife had the Green Chile (pork) plate, great taste but again needed just a bit more rice and beans.Ozzie recommended we cap off our meal off with a Churro, another great recommendation. Ya gotta have one and take one to go! Great prices and food!"}
{"text":"This family owned, reasonably priced Mexican restaurant is not only a rare find in Vegas but it's also beyond delicious! The young son of the owners, Sam, is the host, server and busser; and does a great job! The chips and salsa are the AMAZING start to a home cooked meal you'll love. My husband got the 5$ special which was 3 fish tacos; inhaled it and ordered it again! I got the huevos Mexicana which I continued to eat after being stuffed. Sam recommended the dish because it's what his mom cooks for them at home for breakfast. Sam's mom is your chef so be patient while she cooks food for you, that's good enough for her family!"}
{"text":"This place is a real gem, so glad we went and checked it out. The restaurant shares a space with Doc Holliday's bar, but it is separate, and very family friendly. The restaurant area is very cozy with only seven tables, very modest decor and i clean. This is a family run business and the wait staff are the kids of the family, they were all very professional and knowledgeable. The food was super fresh and hot which is the way I like it. The portions were  good sized  and the prices are fantastic. I would have paid double and still be satisfied. I will be back often."}
{"text":"Really great food. Everything is homemade. Family owned. Incredibly sweet service. We want to adopt Ozzie. :) She is a doll!  The prices couldn't be more reasonable. The chips and guacamole are amazing!  Actually, everything is. Give it a try:)"}
{"text":"It was OK... I'm a foodie and love Mexican so wanted to try it out.  Wasnt impressed! The waitress was super sweet :) the food on the other hand was out of a can.  With all the Mexican restaurants in town this is not worth checking out."}
{"text":"If you know me you know I love Mexican food. Maribel's is doing it BIG over here and at low price.   It's nothing fancy here so if you need to be seen or require a mariachi band killing your ear drums than this is not for you.   The menu is limited and at the same time everything I have tried has been stellar. 1. Chicken taco combo (3 street tacos, rice , beans) $6. All white meat chicken seasoned well. It's going to be hard to try more of the menu because this my shit.  2. Carne Asada taco combo- same as above and real good.  3. Chicken Enchiladas (comes with two) - Pretty damn good.   I LOVE their guacamole, homemade chips and red salsa, rice and beans. I bet even just a bean burrito or breakfast burrito would be bomb here.   Point is food is solid, affordable and it's a local family owned business. I have to give props to the server Ozzy (I hope that's her name. It may be Izzy. I know I suck.) Her service is on point and she remembers me which scores major points and tips.    Maribel's gets the World Cup of Mexican Food for Green Valley. Nacho Daddy can drown in their scorpion shots and well Lindo is Lindo. I'll be right here with my homies."}
{"text":"After reading reviews here on Yelp, decided to give it a try for lunch. We were not disappointed at all. My wife and I prefer  the little, local, hole in the wall places, and this place definitely qualifies. But DO NOT let that deter you, because this little place is worth a try.  We started with chips and salsa and an order of guacamole. Salsa was spicy with a nice, fresh made flavor. The made fresh when you order it guac knocked our socks off, not overly spicy, but fresh, fresh, fresh...and you can't beat that.  And enjoying it on fresh made tortilla chips was even better, second batch was still warm.  For entrees my wife went with the shredded beef tostada, I had the smothered pork chili burrito and we shared a cheese quesadilla. The best testament I can give is that we both left empty plates. Wife said the tostada was very good, with fresh veggies and a couple big slices of avacado. The pork burrito was delicious, with the right amount of spice and very flavorful pork filling. The tomatillo \"smother\" added a nice bite as well.  Server was attentive and never let our drink glasses empty. For a price of $20 it was a very good experience."}
{"text":"excellent food excellent server \"Ozzie\" always empty though fast service, good Margaritas from next dooe, One particular menu note that doesnt make any sense at all and for no reason at all--- some dinner plates come with 3 tacos. (BUT ONLY IF YOU GET FLOUR TORTILLAS) iF YOU ask for crispy shells then they only give you  (2) what kinda crap is that???????? been to thousands of Mexican restaurants and never seen that silly rule......"}
{"text":"I've lived in Silverado Ranch for a long time, and I'm constantly hunting for a good Mexican restaurant. This place recently opened in the Doc Holliday's across from Michael's. My family checked it out, really liked it, and then took me there last night. It's really, really good food! Very authentic Mexican food with huge portions, and ridiculously cheap. I had a 3 taco combo (2 chicken and 1 carne asada), it came with rice and beans and was way more than anyone should eat in one sitting. It was $6! For 3 of us, dinner was $23. You absolutely cannot find food like this anywhere else in Silverado Ranch.  My dad chatted with the owner, and the place is family owned and operated. It's a sweet family, and they put their blood, sweat, and tears into the place. They've got it painted and spruced up really nice. It's clean and cozy inside.   I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because its new and they're still getting started. I'd really like to see this place do well, so I can keep going back!"}
{"text":"New favorite Mexican food place in Las Vegas.  Amazing! Started with homemade chips and salsa. Added Pico De Gallo. I had the special: shredded beef burrito enchilada style.  Gf had three soft tacos (homemade tortillas with the tacos). Both came with rice and beans. One diet coke, two waters; entire bill $13.50.  Good service, as cheap as Robertos and Faustos.  Will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for dinner and wasn't disappointed. It's inside Doc Holliday's if you can really say that since it seems more of a next door neighbor to the bar. I figured I would be walking through the bar to get to Maribel's and you can, but the door I went into led me straight inside Maribel's. Hubby and I were greeted right away and told to sit wherever we wanted. Our server was excellent! She got our drink order and brought us some chips and salsa right away. I usually like chunky salsa and this salsa was thin, but it had a lot of good, fresh flavor and the chips were tasty. For $3.99 I ordered a side of Chips and Guacamole and my oh my was it so good! It was made fresh to order and had such great flavor. I'm very impressed at the price of the chips and guac considering it was fresh and the portion was good. If you are a fan of guacamole you must try it here at Maribel's! They have daily specials for just $5 that includes a drink.   Monday - Chicken Enchiladas  Tuesday - Carne Asada Tacos Wednesday - Fish Tacos Thursday - Carne Asada Burrito Friday - Chicken Sub Saturday - Shredded Beef Burrito Sunday - Hamburger or Cheeseburger  I was there on a Tuesday, so I decided to go with the Carne Asada Tacos. You get 3 tacos, rice, beans and a drink. If you want flour tortillas you can also get that for no additional charge, but you get 2 tacos instead of 3 and our sever said they are bigger than the regular ones. Options are nice! The asada had good flavor and the tacos were filled nicely, especially for the price. The beans were good and the rice was even better. It's awesome that you can get quality food that tastes so good for $5 plus tax and leave stuffed. Inside was clean and they have TV's. I can't say enough about our server. She checked on us often and took the time to chit chat with us for a bit letting us know about other specials and I could tell she was genuinely passionate about the food being served here. They even take phone orders if you don't have time or want to eat inside. I saw several people picking up to-go orders. I don't live in the neighborhood that Maribel's is in, but when I am on this side of town, I will definitely be stopping by for some good grub!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the service. I enjoyed my chimichanga, which was good, but my husband had the hue so rancheros and said it was the best hed ever eaten. Thats saying a lot as he eats them wherever we go.   Its a shame this place is so hard to find. It was completely dead inside - on a Friday night. We were the only customers.   They deserve better.    Do yourself a favor and check them out. The prices for the specials ($5 for a huge plate of food) are the best youll find in town.   Oh and even though its small, this is a sit down restaurant and not a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"This place is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants. The food is really good, the portions are excellent, and best of all, the prices are an incredible value!   They have daily specials for five dollars, which includes rice and beans and a drink. You can't beat those prices! So far I've tried two of these deals, and the food has been very, very good.   This place is run by a family, and everyone is very friendly, and they're always attentive.   If you get a chance, check this place out. I really hope that they do well, because it's not too often that you find a restaurant run by good people, good prices AND good food."}
{"text":"Without going into too much detail because I don't have a lot of time, this place is awesome.  It's comfy, great location, welcoming, and most importantly, DELICIOUS.  The prices are awesome, and the staff (from the couple times we've seen) is the children of the owners.  But they always get the orders right and are friendly.  The parents have done a good job raising kids AND training them with good work ethic.  If you're looking for an awesome place to eat, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food and you do not have to spend a lot for it. Family owned and ingredients are fresh. There are daily specials and you can get inexpensive alcoholic beverages as well. It is truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Awesome service, delicious food and great prices!! Definitely will be back! This little place just became my favorite Mexican restaurant! Thanks Maribel!"}
{"text":"My server was very attentive and a delight in general. The food however still was not what I have been looking for in Las Vegas. I ordered my fail safe dish of cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. That being said it was still good, just not the best. I'm beginning to think that the only great Mexican food I am going to find will be back home in LA. Would I come back? Possibly."}
{"text":"Coming from So Cal, Mexican food is a vital part of my everyday food category. I was hoping to find a place I could eat here when visiting my parents. I can say this is probably one of the worst establishment I've ever been in and truly some of the worst \"food\" (if I can even call it that) that I've ever had. The \"salsa\" was water with little flavor. The chips were very greasy. The beans had no flavor but they were the correct texture. The Spanish rice was edible but barely edible. The portions were equivalent to a child's plate. Honestly I am shocked that this place has as many positive reviews as it does. I will not be back. I usually love hole in the wall, dive'y places. This place just didn't cut it. Oh and they charge you for EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh, fresh! The guacamole and fish tacos were the best I've ever had - tacos double wrapped. This is on track to become our favorite family hangout."}
{"text":"A lot of food for the money.  Pretty good, not spectacular, but I do hope that this business survives.  It is in such a strange location (inside Doc Holliday's) with almost no signage outside.  The inside is a big room with old booths, a concrete floor, and minimal not particularly attractive decor.    We will probably eat there again (or get take-out), but Maribel makes me appreciate the charm and food quality at Las Cazuelas, the other pretty new place located in the same shopping center.  LC serves smaller portions but the food is regional Mexican (not your typical fare) of excellent quality.  The people serving us at both restaurants were very nice which is one reason I hope both of them survive.  Bottom line:  If we want ambiance and excellent authentic food we will go to Las Cazuelas.  If we want good food and a lot of leftovers, we will go to Maribel's."}
{"text":"Located in the Target shopping center next to Michael's, Ulta, Nike, etc., Maribel's was not super easy to find after we yelped it. There's a sign hanging up next to Doc Holiday's Saloon. Apparently Maribel's took over the restaurant part and the next door bar is still Doc Holiday's.  Upon entering I was immediately hit in the face with a moderate cigarette smoke smell, to me, really disgusting. My husband was starving and needed to eat right away or something violent would happen. We were greeted by a a friendly younger waitress and she said we could sit wherever we wanted. We picked a booth as far from the cigarette party and she brought us chips and salsa. My husband asked what the speciality was and she told us the green chili carnitas. She explained how everything down to the salsa and tortillas are made here in the kitchen. I ordered the chicken fajitas and my daughter got the pork taco plate (3 street style tacos with rice and beans). We ordered a side of guac which was pretty awesome. All the food came out and it was very good, high quality and fresh. Total bill was $40.31. My husband ordered a beer from the bar next door which the waitress got for him, $2 draft Red Hook. The waitress was super friendly, very sweet. She explained how her parents bought the restaurant and her mom is the cook and she and her siblings wait tables, obviously all a hard working family, not like my spoiled children... It's not a ritzy place, but the Mexican music playing in the background, friendly service and good food might make up for the smell of the bar next door slightly wafting cigarette smoke under the double doors that separate the two locations. That's really the only bad part of the place, leaving and getting into my car my sweater and hair stunk like cigarette smoke. I don't know if I'll go back because of that, I wanted guac and chips, not to smell like a dirty ashtray."}
{"text":"Good place to stop for lunch.  Lunch specials are $5 and include a drink.  I stopped in on a Tuesday and got the 3 steak taco lunch special.  It came with re-fried beans and rice, muy bueno."}
{"text":"Ok this is inside Doc Holliday's or vice versa I never can tell, either way I did not have the Mexican food soothes is a review of the bar and bar food. If you pick up The Sunday magazine there is a coup in the back for a free drink. I had a Shock Top, to be honest it was a little not cold. The bartender however was quite nice. I had the hamburger it was ok, not great just ok.I can't complain for 4.50. Overall this is a friendly local pub with a great happy hour. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"This is a good hole in the wall spot located inside doc holidays. It's nothing fancy just good Mexican food. I've been here twice and first time i had the $5 fish taco special and today we had the $5 carne asada burrito special. Both times the food was good no complaints. Good service and food!"}
{"text":"Super good carne asada fries. Some of the best I had. The waitress was super friendly. A little bit long of a wait for the food but otherwise a great dine"}
{"text":"Free Fresh Made Chips & Salsa! My first time here and I ordered 2 Enchiladas one Shredded Beef w/ Roja or Red Sauce and one Chicken w/ Verde (little spicy kick) that comes with Beans, Rice, Lettuce, and Sour Cream. I also ordered a Fish Taco since a lot of people talked and order it on Yelp. All of my food was excellent! waitresses also sweet and friendly. This place is very casual seat yourself at one of the booths and the waitress will be right with you! I'll definitely be back food was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but just that. Salsa was kinda bland as was the rice and beans. Shredded beef tacos were best part of lunch. Not overly impressed especially considering the dining room is pretty sketchy and for whatever reason there was a sheet of plastic covering the table. Probably will find a different spot next time"}
{"text":"good food and portion size with good prices.  Only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is the ambiance of the restaurant - a little outdated for decor, not a place I would typically bring people visiting."}
{"text":"Talk about a hidden gem! This place fits that description to a T! I'm a sucker for Mexican food and when Jessie suggested this place for dinner I was all in.   Maribel's is located inside Doc Holliday's. It has a very simple decor, but they don't need it cause their food is that good. Their menu is simple, but has all the authentic Mexican food you'd want. Plus, they have an awesome $5 daily specials. They also serve their breakfast items all day.   Jessie and I ordered the chips and guacamole which was only $3.99. Wow! The bowl of guacamole was huge and perfectly flavored. The salsa had the perfect kick. We  both choose the steak chimichangas,wet with everything on it. While we were chatting and enjoying our chips and guacamole all of a sudden a homeless lady was beside me handing me a note written on a small cocktail napkin. In the note she was asking for money. I was so thrown off and felt incredibly awkward. I don't think our young waitress noticed that this was happening because the homeless woman scurried away before our waitress appeared again. Finally our food came out. They look so tasty and it was! It also was way hot temperature wise. The crispy shell was filled with steak and cheese. Plus it was piled with more guacamole, sour cream and pico. Also, the enchilada sauce pulled it all together. Yummy!!!   We left with full tummies! The service is pretty good here and the food is wonderful. I love random hole in the wall places like this. If you love authentic Mexican food check out Maribels!"}
{"text":"My coworker told me about this place, so glad she did. Great Mexican good and made from scratch. No canned stuff here. Even our chips were handmade. What was most impressive was the waiter. He couldn't be older than 15 and was helping his mother run the entire restaurant. He was very professional and even working on a Saturday! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review with a full tummy and let me tell you it is a happy tummy. I'm glad my cheat day was chosen wisely this week ! Yelp did not let me down with this place ! If youre coming and expecting a fancy Restraunt with a mariachi band you won't find that here. What u will find is a cute little hole in the wall place next to a bar. Literally when you walk in to the left is the bar and to the right is Maribels. A tiny place with a few tables and booths , has two pool tables a few TVs and a kitchen in the back where all the magic happens. When I say magic. Literally it is magical what happens behind those doors !   I initially came in to try the daily Saturday special but I was told they were out of shredded beef. So I asked for a few minutes to decide on what to order since I had mind set on the shredded beef burrito. The server and owners son Sam asked me if I needed help with any recommendations but I told him I heard everything here was good I just needed a Minute to decide. I knew I wanted guac because I love guac and enjoy when it's done right. Who doesn't love guac ?! If you don't we can't be friends let's state the obvious and move on. Lol , but seriously I'm not joking. Since my phone was dead I couldn't check yelp for recommendations or photos . I asked Sam some questions about the menu and he was very helpful and friendly. I placed my order and waited patiently.     Guac - Perfect consistency it's not completely smooth which is what I love. I love a guac that has chunks ! You can tell that it's freshly made I'm almost convinced it was made to order. So yummy ! Big chunks of Avacado , cilantro , tomato and onion. Perfect !   Huarache - almost like a tortilla but thicker .  Topped with beans cheese and a generous piece of tender Carne Asada ! I'm almost certain the huarache was made to order the masa tasted so fresh. This my friends was literally , a party in my mouth ! So good. I've never had a huarache before and I'm not sure I would order it anywhere else because This was so good I would expect the same.   My one and only complaint is that there  wasnt enough chips for the generous size of guacamole they give you. That can easily be fixed by just asking for extra. Im sure it wouldn't be an issue.   I definitely missed out on the daily special but It doesn't bother me at all because I was so satisfied and I will definitely be back ! Maribels is doing it big in Flavortown. I just wished they weren't so far from me :("}
{"text":"Love the food and friendly service.  a family favorite for sure! Their pico is amazing! The prices are great. Re fried beans are so yummy. Best ever is the red wet shredded beef burrito $5 deal on Saturdays but so good I order it even when it's not the special."}
{"text":"Best FRESH Mexican food in the city!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I've had in Las Vegas! My mom is Hispanic and I grew up on her home made enchiladas and the ones I had here were even better than hers! I told all my friends to go. It's a little hidden in the shopping center but I hope business picks up for them soon! I'll definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"You'd never know this place was located inside doc holidays. The decor was awful. Place was empty at lunch, which came as a surprise considering all the reviews saying how good it was. The server must of been hiding in the back because after  using the restroom, I came out to a completely empty restaurant with NO help in sight. I went into the crappy little bar this place was in looking for help and the bartender stood near the register on the phone. Never asked if I needed help or anything. Terrible experience. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my entire experience here.  From the outside you see 1 single banner thats easily over seen by the Doc Holiday's signs that take over the entire building, but I'm glad I took the time to stop in and have the best mexican food I have had in Las Vegas. I have lived in Las Vegas and have tried lots of mexican restaurant this city has to offer, and this one was by far my favorite. When you first walk in you aren't overwhelmed with loud hispanic music and dim red lighting (like every other cantina in Las Vegas), You are greeted with the family who runs the whole operation. The decor was simple,  but it obviously wasn't the focus, because the food and the service was the real star.  I ordered a the chicken enchilada meal. It came with a drink, rice, beans, and 2 enchilada's, which is more than enough food. Get this, it was 5 dollars! thats a deal! it cost more to eat at Roberto's and I wasn't violently attacked from the food 30 minutes later like I am when I go to Roberto's or Faustos. obviously I was excited that it was so keep, but it was absolutely delicious. you can tell that the chicken was seasoned, moist, and made with love.  Our server was a young boy, probably about 13 or 14. whenever I go to a family restaurant and the service is by the children, it can be awkward and kinda painful to watch these young kids try and interact with adults and do a good job, but not for this kid. He was bright, lively, and not awkward at all. He was very quick to have combacks to our jokes, and was very good at answering our questions. Not to mention he gave us better service than that of adults at far more expensive restaurants.  I will gladly comeback, and I am constantly telling everyone I know about this place."}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa, carne asada burrito, side of beans, side of rice, large coke $5.40 tax included on Thursdays. WOW show me where else you can get that?  The place is a dive similar to many I've eaten at in Mexico. That's fine for me makes me kind of nostalgic for the time I spent down there. Is this place a drug front? Possible. It would explain how they stay open charging those prices. Maybe not a place to bring your wife or girlfriend but if your meeting a friend for lunch and you want something cheap and tasty. Bienvenidos a Maribels."}
{"text":"Don't let the haters sway you.  This food is great and there are some who come here and rate poorly for no real reason.  Having carne asada tacos and they are excellent."}
{"text":"It was finally our turn to try Maribel's for dinner on a recent Thursday and the Yelp friends were correct: delicioso!  It took a few wrong turns for me to find Doc Holliday's where Maribel's is also located, so note that the building is behind Freed's Bakery.  This is definitely a hole-in-the-wall joint, but the food and service were top-notch.  Sam, our very professional and personable teenage host/waiter was at the top of his young game, greeting us and making sure we had our ice water and chips and salsa after we were seated.  There were only two other tables occupied when we arrived and then it was just the B/F and I, which doesn't make sense because the food is great and the prices are more than reasonable.  I had the guacamole and chips all by myself to start since Mel doesn't eat avocados.  The guacamole was fresh with tomatoes and nice chunks of avocado.  The serving was more than I could eat by myself so I took the rest home.  I chose the chicken enchiladas for my meal, which came with rice and beans and it was served piping hot by Sam the man-child.  Bottom line:  the food was great and it was just like eating at a friend's house.  The atmosphere is casual and Sam is the son of Maribel, the marvelous mamacita cooking up the food in the cocina.  We didn't meet her, but Sam proudly told us how his mother is the one doing all the cooking while he and his hermanas help out with everything else in the restaurant; this kid has charm and he loves what he does.   We'll definitely be back and I know it won't be long before I update for cinco estrellas."}
{"text":"I had lunch for less than $10 - you gotta love that!  This was my 2nd time at Maribel's. This was much better than the first, for sure.  Just like my first visit, I was the only customer in the place. That's sad! I hope this isn't the case regularly, because I don't want to see a place like this close.  The daily specials can't be beat. For $5 you get a full meal, plus a drink! I was there most recently on a Thursday and was happy to see that a carne asada burrito was the daily offering. I also ordered a side of guacamole, because it's really delicious and fresh made ($3.99).  I overdid it on the guacamole and chips/salsa, because by the time my giant burrito arrived, I was full! I took it home and enjoyed it later that evening and it was just as good!  There is nothing particularly wrong with the service - but this is definitely not why people go to this restaurant. Trust me, this is a spot worth visiting for quick, cheap and delicious Mexican food."}
{"text":"Walking in though the Doc Holliday's door I didn't really know what to expect when I stepped in Maribel's Kitchen. The restaurant was a little larger than I was expecting and the server approached us immediately for our drink order and we put in an order for guacamole while we looked over the menu.  They have daily specials that all looked amazing. Since it was Tuesday, we both opted for the carne asada tacos special. This comes with three tacos, rice, beans and a drink, all for the low price of $5. How amazing is that. The rest of the menu was extensive and had good prices as well.  Our guacamole arrived and it was heaven in a bowl. Big chunks of avocado and not overly blended, I couldn't get enough. I tried to be a lady, but I really wanted to eat it by the spoonful. For $3.99, it was a great value and the portion was enormous.  Our tacos came out and I was even more amazed. Everything tasted great and I was stuffed and very happy by the end of my meal.   Service was attentive and refills were plentiful. I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu and, of course, to order more guacamole."}
