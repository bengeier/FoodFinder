{"text":"I grew up in Michigan eating at Elias Brother's and only eating the Slim Jim.  They stopped selling it!  Why would a company stop selling one of the best sandwiches ever made?  I was so disappointed this morning when I had to eat the buffet because I was too hungry to go somewhere else, considering I was in Baker, CA.  The food was disgusting.  I hate Bob's BB.  They need to bring back that sandwich or just close the place."}
{"text":"Where is the restaurant? It doesn't exist at the location shown."}
{"text":"I came here when they opened, it was OK. As time has passed I don`t know what happened but it`s just plain bad. I wont be back which is a shame since it`s so convienient.. Go bye Bob!!!!"}
{"text":"After partying on the strip for 2 nights, it was finally time to head back home to OC.   I've got to say this has got to be one of the best food places to cure any kind of hangover. Seriously, you need to order the potato pancakes...Their servings are just right to fill you up!"}
{"text":"\"We getting Big Boy's! We gettin Big Boy's!\"  Yea I waited so long for this magical chain to open up in Vegas....I haven't had Bob's since I was probably hitting puberty.  Those GINORMOUS DOUBLE CHEESEBURGERS.....  Uh....yea. I ordered to go....I got home... (looking through bifocals) \"WHERE'S THE BEEF\"  I noticed it when the bag was so light. My shake...FANTASTIC! Bag....Light. Well I just worked out. Yea that's it.... NO! Big Boy was a lil guy. WTF??? Yea talk about disappointing. The fries..eh....so so. How do you really f*ck up fries. It wasn't bad. I was just so so ....Arrrrgghhh. This isn't Bob's Big Boy!  This is a consipiracy. Bob is being held captive by terrorists! Please GIVE BOB BACK....All we are saying is Give Bob a CHANCE! Eh no. I dunno. I was smaller back then in puberty. There's so much more better burger places... +1 star for the shake"}
{"text":"This location is now closed and it looks like a Dunkin' Donuts drive thru is coming soon to take its place. I'm bummed I didn't get to try the Big Boy in time...but then again it's hard to argue with convenient donuts in the 'hood."}
