{"text":"Such a tasty fresh lunch spot! As others have said it's like going home for lunch.  I have had their sandwiches, usually turkey or tuna and they have a great selection of fresh breads and vegetables to top with.   The real star however is the 2 or 3 salad combo. The 3 salads comes to around $7 after tax and they always have a great selection. I favour the greek pasta or tuna pasta salad and then couscous and the arugala/beet/feta/pecan. You can really tell that they make them fresh that day. I always feel satisfied but not overly \"full\" afterwards which is perfect.   I also love their spinach pies (basically a spanakopita) for 3.99.  With a side salad it too makes a perfect lunch.  Make sure to check out the soups while you're there too, the red lentil is especially tasty.  Free WiFi! Couch and comfortable chairs!  Note: someone mentioned no debit? They definitely DO have debit."}
{"text":"Quiet place within the artist hub Richmond 401. They provide several organic coffees, and the Americano is good. Worth visiting this place if you want a peaceful afternoon."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick, healthy meal at a reasonable price, look no further than The Roastery!  I definitely eat here WAY too often since I started working in the area, and even though I'm not a coffee drinker, I'm just as much of an addict when it comes to their 3-choice salad. My favourite is the chickpea, followed by the pesto green beans, then edamame and, depending on the day, I'll either round those out with cheese tortellini (warm or cold it's delicious), or their arugula and beet salad.  Everything is always fresh, and dressing is either topped-to-order or never over-saturated in any of the premixed salads.  The baked goods, cleverly nestled near the cash register, are a great grab-and-go snack (I tend to devour my chocolate chip or peanut butter cookie before I even get to my salad), and they are certainly just as tasty and less costly than any of the other nearby establishments... an added bonus when you also don't have to wait 10-15 minutes to get your food!  Beyond the pleasant staff, the place is clean and well-lit, they are always prepared for the lunch rush, and everything is always clearly-labeled. If you have questions, the staff always knows the answer, which is great if you have any dietary restrictions or allergies.  On a nice day, there are even a few spots just outside the door to eat while enjoying the fresh air, which is a welcome change when you're in such a busy part of the city."}
{"text":"I'm fine paying a higher price point for a sandwich here because the quality used to be worth it. However, all the competent women who used to run this place have been replaced with (for lack of a more accurate word) dopey men. And this is relevant because if I make any request while a sandwich is being made, they act like I'm being a nag. Sexist tension is not a good appetizer.  Today I really gave up on this place. I'd been holding my tongue all while one of these new dopes made the most half-assed sandwich I've ever seen. I thought \"I'll just open it and rearrange it when I get back to the office, I don't wanna be a nag\". But who puts one thick vertical line of mayo down the centre of square bread? Or doesn't even ask if you want lettuce/tomato before cutting it? An untrained adult has better sandwich-instincts; it was like watching a toddler make a sandwich. And because of the grumpiness I've experience from employees here in the past, I felt under pressure to tiptoe around his feelings as if he were a toddler too.  I asked someone trained to correct it but they instead threw it in the trash, wasting all the time I'd spent away from my desk. I didn't have time for them to make a new one so had to ask for my money back, which they did resentfully as if it had been ME who threw the sandwich out. The whole experience had more of an impact than any sandwich-related experience should have, because they acted like I was being unreasonable for expecting the basic quality they're charging for. I could go get a ball of grease from the Tim Hortons if that's how I want to start my day.  If you're not going to supervise new hires, then invest a basic amount of time training them. Why does it seem like this place is run by people who've never handled food or money before? The only people who seem to know what they're doing are the two Asian women who work there. Make the older one the manager and let her do the hiring. She super competent and she's always friendly."}
{"text":"Not right on the street, but the extra 10 steps are definitely worth it!  This place is pretty great. They have a downtown location, and serve up great coffee in the am and also have a great lunch menu.   Great for a group of eaters with diverse nutritional restrictions.  There are a lot of gluten free, and vegetarian options which are delicious and reasonably priced.   Coffee, Lattes, speciality drinks are all under $5.00 which I think is just great!  Cozy holiday drinks are lovely, including hot ginger lemonade   They have a great lunch spread complete with: 3 flavour of soup which change daily Large assortment of salads Variety of delicious sandwiches made in front of you Many dessert options  Seating available or you can take your food to go!"}
{"text":"I work in the building and go to the roastery sometimes in the morning and during my afternoon break.  I have mixed feelings about this place.  Some of their items are yummy and worth the money, but they have a bad habit of fluctuating the prices at their own convenience.  The service depends on who is taking your order.    They recently started making these really tasty cranberry/blueberry brownies in the afternoon.  The only problem is they hiked up the price by half within a week and began to serve old stale brownies from days prior with no price adjustment.  Now you only get half of what you got before for the +3 dollar price point (sometimes stale)... not good business practice if you ask me.   Their toasted bagel with two slices of cheese for only $2.36 is definitely a good deal though... lets just hope tomorrow I don't get offered an open faced bagel at the same price ; D..."}
{"text":"It was too late to cancel my latte when I saw 1. they didn't keep the milk in the fridge 2. they didn't rinse any espresso equipment after using it or before they use it. Maybe the coffee would taste better if I didn't see it. The sandwiches are really good, they're all freshly prepared everyday. I would go back for their avocado mix on my sandwich again but not for their specialty coffees. By the way, wifi is free here!"}
{"text":"I recently started working in the area and have been to the Roastery a few times now.  So far, so good! The lattes are good (although a bit strong for my weak tastes) and reasonably priced. They also give a discount when you bring your own mug.    The service has been fine on my visits, although I haven't been in when its super busy."}
{"text":"I wonder why these amazing chic cafes are hidden from plain sight? Guess that's what Yelp is for !!  Roastery has good variety of coffee options to start with. All specialty coffees are less that $5. They have custom made to order food options plus something to-go as well. It's perfect for a quick bite during lunch hours or spending time enjoying your cuppa overlooking large windows."}
{"text":"I 100% love the location and the building.  LOVE the building. BUT the service at this place is horrible.  The baristas don't listen to your order and you just settle on whatever they heard and give you because the place is so packed you assume it's just that they are busy and frazzled taht they dont' have time to listen to you.  but I'd rather go to a place where I can get what I order and enjoy the RIGHT order.  Free wifi is a slightly redeeming quality.  But as adorable and \"vancouver coffee house\" as it is- it still isn't good coffee."}
{"text":"Bad service and subpar coffee. The foam on my cappuccino was all bubbles and cold at the top. Disappointed when I'm spending 3 bucks on a drink."}
{"text":"I miss this charming little cafe tucked into a corner of the nicely refurbished 401 building.  I used to grab lunch here almost everyday, there was enough variety that I wasn't bored coming back time and again.  They have great fresh salads, made with chick pea, avocado or pasta (these do rotate), cups of yogurt filled with berries and granola (good for a snack), chow mein noodles, baked goods, and even a bunch of california rolls wrapped and ready to go.  Several varieties of tasty coffee too, grab your cup and bring it up to pay."}
{"text":"The Roastery provides an appreciated alternative to the poorly-laid-out Starbucks or hit-or-miss Le Gourmand coffee, but they're more than just a coffee joint.  They do tasty and affordable foodstuffs too.  Between the decent coffee, the smiling staff and the healthy lunch choices, this is my number one weekday lunchtime escape when I'm feeling that 9 to 5 rut.    Hello, high ceilings.  Hi there, big windows.  Obama-bump, free wifi!"}
{"text":"I got the jerk chicken wrap as I read somewhere it was good. I HAVE NEVER HAD A MORE TASTELESS sandwich in my life. Not only that there was NO jerk seasoning, I don't think the chicken had any flavor at all. Perhaps I am biased because I do eat REAL and sometimes really hot jerk chicken, but this had absolutely no spice at all. I did not eat ANY spice few years ago and if I had this sandwich back then, it would still be tasteless and flavorless.   I also got carrot juice which tasted really ODD...... kinda like the real thing but not really. I tasted a hint of potato and pumpkin, and perhaps sugar....? Not impressed!  Needless to say, I will NOT be going there anymore."}
{"text":"The Roastery is a staple in the 401 Richmond building.  It provides coffee to many people who work in the area looking for something better than the usual office sludge.  They also offer a variety of healty sandwiches and salads and cold pastas that you can (and will) enjoy.  However, the sandwiches, while great, are exactly the kind of sandwich you can make at home if you take the time to do it.  There's nothing special about any of the ingredients.  The place itself is a cozy spot and I've spent many a lunch break here just sitting and reading.  I've witnessed all sorts of interactions though: people hanging out, people having company meetings, people having 1 on 1 interviews or business pitches.  Seems to be a location for any occasion."}
{"text":"Great place to get coffee in the morning. When there's a line snaking out the door of every Starbucks in the core at 8 am, the Roastery is your choice. Walk in, get your cup. pour your coffee, and get out. A nice selection of coffees, although they don't seem to vary them much."}
{"text":"It's more about the setting and the non-Starbucks appeal than anything else, I think. Located in the lovely 401 building, it's a refreshing alternative to the quicky choices we usually go for.  It's true the service isn't great but everything else is and they have quite tasty snacks and an alternative selection of sandwiches and wraps."}
{"text":"This place is actually the biggest rip off ever! Paid close to $9 for three perogies and 5 leafs of lettuce. Love the roastery in liberty village but this place sucks ball sacks...So many other better spots in the area to go for lunch. Never again!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable, and they have a great selection of foods and baked goods.    But, despite working in this building twice a week I rarely frequent the Roastery for two reasons: 1) They don't take debit which can be very annoying at times 2) Their coffee isn't very fresh, so unless you are getting made-to-order types of caffeine, the coffee is meh.  Really cute place, decent food, a bit pricey and the coffee underwhelms."}
{"text":"The Roastery is a nice place to relax with a book over a nice cup of tea or coffee. The location can't be beat -- close to Queen West and the Entertainment District. There are other cafes in the area (e.g. Dark Horse, Little Nicky's), however it can be hard to find a table at those places. The Roastery has plenty of seating and I have never had a problem finding seating there. I also like that they have good food options in case you get hungry. Most cafes just have baked goods, but here you can find healthier options like yogurt or their freshly made salads (I recently had one with sweet potatoes and chicken, and the chickpea couscous one is good too)."}
{"text":"My favourite thing to get here is the cheese croissant. It is very yummy but I wish they would somehow have it displayed in an enclosed space. It is more on the expensive side. All their staff are female...it would be great to see some diversity."}
{"text":"Extremely rustic coffee shop serving fresh hot breakfast till 11:30, sandwiches, soups, and coffee. A mosaic rustic setting of exposed brick, pipes, tall ceiling high French windows, and pieces of local art hanging all around. Great atmosphere with jazz playing in the background.  I was in the hunt for gluten free bread breakfast egg sandwich and I found it here. Not so sure why many stores don't have gluten free options we are living in the 20th century after all and every single person has some sort of food allergy with GLUTEN being one of them... any who and scoobydoo...they have gluten free OPTIONS here.  Sandwich was delicious I chose wasabi, and mustard as my dressings and olives and cucumber as my toppings, with the egg sandwiched between two pieces of gluten free bread for a cool $5.25, I was in heaven!  Ahhh great place to day dream, write, or meet a certain someone (-;"}
{"text":"This airy brick-and-beam café is located in the base of the 401 Richmond building at Richmond and Spadina. It's a large space with lots of tables and (actually comfortable) chairs. There are even a few club chairs in the back around a short coffee table.  This seems like the go-to place for anyone who works in the building or nearby. In addition to coffee and tea, they have sandwiches, pastries, cold drinks, fresh juice and other snacks. I ordered a chai latte on my visit and damn, it was actually pretty good. I guess I'm surprised because I've been underwhelmed at their sister store in Liberty Village.   For the mobile commuter: I noticed quite a few outlets here. They claimed to have free Wi-Fi, but it might not have been working on the afternoon of my visit.  I shall return.  Obligatory Title Pun: I propose a ROAST.  Menu Readability: Really poor handwriting on a series of chalkboards.  Need to mention: It's a bit drafty in here. I dunno, I felt like mentioning that.  What this place teaches me about myself: Cold is my enemy."}
{"text":"The Roastery is conveniently located near almost every hip office building in the city, including my old stomping grounds at Movember HQ. I've probably frequented this unique coffee/snack venue about 20 times.   I'd often grab one of their special pasta salads, coffee and/or a sandwich. I was partial to their egg salad, which is made to order. The servers were always generous with the toppings and genuinely lovely.  MUST MENTION: In the summertime you can take your food to go and go to the stunning rooftop garden and check-out the Toronto skyline (while avoiding going back to work, perhaps).  TIP: Order their lentil soup. It's delicious and hearty enough to be a good wintertime meal. *Not always veggie based, so look out if you don't eat meat.   GOTTA LOVE: Free wifi."}
