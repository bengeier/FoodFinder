{"text":"I'm with Dee on the above review, I love this place and stop by to grab a slice whenever I am up at Crocker Park.  This is the only place in Cleveland that I know that serves NY Style Pizza, no Dominoes/sbarro's does not count!  They also serve Calzones, Subs, Pepperoni Rolls, Canolli's and other sweets like tiramisu.  Also, the prices here do rock and you get much more than you paid for.  Very Cheap Eats, 2 giant pizzas are $20's.  I'm thankful that someone in the Cleveland area can finally make Authenic NY Style Pizza and I know, I lived in NYC for 2 years.  The staff is also very friendly at Casa Vella.  Will continue to go back and back.  I think they also deliver in the Westlake area."}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone says.  I love this pizza place.  It's the place my family orders from when we have family get togethers.  When I worked at Crocker Park it was my favorite place for lunch.  It's everything I love about pizza.  The slices are huge new york style.  Crisp crust that's still chewy.  Fresh toppings.  The pizzas are huge and filled with tons of toppings.  By far my abolute favorite in Cleveland and the surrounding neighborhoods (Yes I have had Angelos and Sweet Basil and all those others) Today I tried a cannoli.  Filled to order with ricotta cheese custard...gives restaurants in Little Italy a run for their money.   Also their prices pretty much rock.  Two huge cheese slices for 5 bucks?  Yep."}
{"text":"This place always has different prices. The pizza is always ice cold and they never wash their hands. And the prices are ridiculous. Better off somewhere else. Not to mention how greasy the pizza is."}
