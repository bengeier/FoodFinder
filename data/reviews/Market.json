{"text":"Just had drinks at the bar for happy hour.  Great service and quality drinks.  We sat inside since it was winter but it looked like there was a great outdoor patio area for the summer months."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and wanted to try Market since it's so close to my new home. My husband and I will definitely be going back! The inside is way bigger than expected. It was a nice day so we decided to sit out on the patio. Our waiter, Chad, provided excellent service and made some great recommendations. The food was very good. I'm excited to go back and try more items on the menu. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food is always great.  The service is always average on its best day. Brunch menus is the best so putting up with crappy service is unavoidable."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! Drinks are amazing. Service matches. Sat at the bar tonight and had a great meal, great bartenders and fantastic ambiance. I would highly recommend this place for a date night or for a night with friends."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch.  Got a veggie skillet and it was delicious, asparagus, spinach, goat cheese.  Came with sour dough bread and flat circular potatoes.  Everything was delicious.  The skillet was great, but I feel like the omelets were bigger so if you are hungrier, get an omellete.  Treated ourselves to a mimosa kit, 4 types of juices and a bottle.    Con:  valet parking.  why can't i park my own car for brunch? It is complimentary but a bit annoying."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday because I had heard how amazing the food is here, and I was not disappointed! My main review goes towards the GM Jill, who has gone above and beyond to make my birthday amazing! A miscommunication caused a bottle of champagne purchased by a friend to not get to our table, so Jill sent my friend and I a gift card AND a bottle of champagne to make it up to us. I've never experienced customer service like this before, so let me just say that it has made me a Market customer for life!"}
{"text":"Arrived last Friday on a rare beautiful Cleveland day, so we wanted the patio.  Somehow, no dice, even though it was early.   Seated and neglected while other patrons were seated, and served their drinks and apps. Not prepared for a Friday night dinner crowd.  Staff not up to parl.  What a shame cuz we are regulars.  Won't be coming around any time soon, cuz we are still sore about the treatment.  BTW, we complained to the hostess as we left, who didn't seem to be too upset about it."}
{"text":"I must start off by saying the food was great. This restaurant was recommended to me as a good late-night food choice. I had the harvest salad which had fresh apples and cheddar and would order it again.  What ruined the experience of this great meal was the service.  I had to ask for the waiter to be sent to our table.  After waiting for the waiter he did not ask if we wanted anything to drink.  More waiting for the waiter to come back to the table to take our orders.  Finally the food came out.  He did not check to see if we needed anything else until we only had a few bites left on our plates.  we then had to wait....and wait....and wait until he asked if we wanted our check.  Once he had the card there was more waiting.    Overall, if you want good and unique food I would recommend the Market; however, make sure you have patience to wait all day for service."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Saturday and the food was just plain not good. Service was wonderful however!"}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed with my experience at The Market. I enjoyed the patio, however the food was just so so. Not to mention their parking lot is annoying if they are packed."}
{"text":"Great drinks, amazing food and awesome service! This is my go-to restaurant on the west side of Cleveland. I've been to brunch, happy hour, and dinner and they've all impressed me. The chicken wings and fried pickles are some of my favorite apps I've ever had! Definitely a must-try!"}
{"text":"My first visit was a mixed bag.  Started off awful and finished much better.   I had reservations for 4 people on a Sunday Brunch at 1:30.  Yes, I knew they had a World Cup party at 4, but I typically don't drink all afternoon when I'm with my Octogenarian parents.  We pulled up to the valet and they would only take our car when we said we had a reservations.  What happened next should get someone fired.  The hostess was absolutely the rudest restaurant employee I have ever encountered.    First, she said they weren't seating people, period.  When I said we had a reservation, she claimed she didn't have it.  Unfortunately for her, an honest employee picked up a list from behind her and said, \"this must be it\".  I could tell the hostess was NOT happy with that employee.  Then she told us we HAD to be done eating no later than 3 and HAD to order within 30 minutes because the kitchen was closing.  When I looked her in the eye and told her she was being rude and that it was obvious that she didn't want to seat us, she turned her head and handed the menus to the honest employee.  That attitude would get most employees fired.  I told our waitress what happened, and I could tell she did everything she could to compensate for our initial impression.  No offer of a complimentary drink or bring the manager to the table, but I guess that's life.  On a better note, all of our entrees were fabulous.  My own entree was the California omelette with wild mushrooms and I had to say it was definitely something to write home about.  Other entrees at the table were the Monte Cristo and two of the skillets.   I had the Spiked Peach Mimosa and can say it was more on the Prosecco side rather than the peach.  I won't complain since I'm a huge fan of the bubbly.  Would I go back?  Probably.  But if I encounter the nasty hostess again, I will get the manager."}
{"text":"I want to preface this by stating that I work in the industry. Service started at a very slow place, it felt like the staff was trying to get organized but couldn't work it out. We ordered drinks and an app from someone who had greeted us and they informed us that our server would be by shortly. When the server did arrive things began to pick up. Our food was fantastic, ny strip and scallops, everything was perfectly cooked!I rarely find a restaurant that has impressive food, thank you!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Wife just had the NY Strip steak served. Cold. Also side substitution was not made. My dinner, the \"river grill\" was good. Fries a bit salty. Bar service is good. Overall, a good place for checking out different beers but food could be warmer."}
{"text":"I have been to this place quite a few times. The atmosphere is good and the food is tasty. The pretzel pickles are great but sooo overpriced ($9!!). Come for taco Thursday for some fresh flavors. They have a decent happy hour although their regular beer prices are higher than comparable restaurants. Overall I say good food but overpriced for the type of restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a place to go and get poor service, order drinks with no alcohol because they don't put any in. If you don't specify you brand of vodka you get the most expensive one,I won't ever go back and certainly would not recommend ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I being the foodies we are, read the reviews about Market and decided we were going to try it.  We got there and it looks so nice, it's super cute, that's about the only good thing I have to say about the place. We got there at about 6:30 tonight(Monday), sat at the bar, ordered our drinks...got mine(John daily with titos) literally had maybe half a shot in it..I was paying 5 bucks for an Arnold Palmer...I could have gone to the gas station and got one for $0.99 if that's what I wanted. Since we hadn't been there before we watched to try these pretzel pickle chips, they sounded amazing. When the bartender finally decided to come back to us 10-15 minutes later..forgetting we were there while she was bs'ing with her regulars, we ordered that, a French dip with the chicken paprikash soup and the toasted mkt caprese.  Mind you while we're sitting there a family of 5 got sat and got their apps right away...while we waited nearly 20 minutes for some fried pickles that we're practically burnt because they looked like someone just threw them in the fryer and forgot about them. They weren't even busy, the restaurant was not even 1/4 full. Then our food finally comes 35-40 minutes AFTER we ordered. Why did it take so long? My sandwich was literally a grilled cheese and the French dip was already prepared foods(not like you're cooking a steak back there), then the paprikash soup was basically chicken and dumplings..nothing paprikash about it. When it came out there was no spoon with it so we asked for one, I'm assuming it was a manager because he was in a button down shirt not the black like the servers and bartenders, hands my boyfriend a spoon with his hand ALL over the part you eat with. How repulsive is that?!? We are not ones to complain about this with myself being a server and he is in culinary school but everything that happened tonight was so unacceptable. Almost 40 minutes for 2 sandwiches, over cooked pickles, a bartender who only cares about the regulars(fine but check on everyone else more than 3 times the whole visit..filling waters when needed...taking our appetizer away when we're done...not acting like a total weirdo), and do not put your dirty paws all over the utensils you expect your guests to eat with. Needless to say we were extremely disappointed by our experience here."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  My first visit to the Market was on a Tuesday afternoon with a party of twelve for a holiday luncheon.  The  restaurant was not very busy and there was one other party seated out on the patio with us.  The service was horrible.  Out of the twelve of us, one of the orders was not submitted to the kitchen and another person with a serious food allergy was misinformed about the food preparation.  Our server seemed to just \"wing it\" with the answers instead of checking with the kitchen.  The lost/missing order (a hamburger) and the replacement order of a basic garden salad seemed to take another half hour to be served.  The remaining ten guest were finished with their lunches by the time the food arrived to the table.  The server also seem uninformed about the availability of items on the dessert menu even though the menu clearly states \"check with your server\".  It took her several trips back and forth from the kitchen just to get the order figured out.  When the ice cream arrived, on the coldest day of the year so far, it was melted to the consistency of a thick soup.  My dessert was the last to arrive on her third trip out and she said \"sorry, I got sidetracked\".  Surprisingly, no manager visited our table after the errors that occurred to apologize or make things right.  I had a Market Burger, which was good, not great.  The patio seating was so cold it cooled the food down quickly.  I won't be going back to the Market and from what I heard other members of our party say, they won't either. ."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend and really enjoyed the food. I had the walleye sandwich with chips and my friend got a chicken sandwich with fries. Get the fries instead of chips, they're delicious! The fish was fried to perfection and the whole sandwich was soooo tasty, I think due to the ranch remoulade."}
{"text":"Lets talk about the salt, wayy tooooo much. But considering the waitstaff eagerly pushing drinks as all to familiar back in the day Ft Lauderdale strip type restaurant strategy.  It all makes sense.  The salt WILL make you thirsty.  Outside of burgers and beer not worth the time with so many more honest restaurants with more edible food so close by.  If you have problems with salt do not go there.      The ingredients were correct but poorly prepared.  AND WAY TOO MUCH SALT!      The waitstaff was good, obviously inexperienced like the kind whom would work in a serve you salt to make you buy drinks restaurant.  Cut off jeans on wait staff?  This is not Key West!      Market; PLEASE CLASS UP YOUR ACT, you are in a great location, great building and great city.  Everything is there for success if put together correctly."}
{"text":"I uses to love going here their menu was awesome and I always had trouble choosing what to eat because everything was good. Last night we went back and were very disappointed with their limited menu, there was not one thing I wanted to eat. We ordered the bahn mi sliders which were not good at all and all of us were very disappointed with our dinners. On top of that the place was literally dead on a Friday! I will not be going back anytime soon!! It's a shame that they changed it!"}
{"text":"went there sunday for brunch and disappointed was an understatement.  it was not our server's fault but when you have to wait an hour and a half for your food and still do not get it, it is time to leave.  manager explained they were training a new chef.  here is a hint.  don't train him on the busiest sat of the week.  wanted it to be good again but this place has gone off the radar screen for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! Great atmosphere. Went with a party of 4 and we all loved it and definitely will be returning.  Great selection of food and drinks. We had the buffalo wings which were yum! We ordered the scallops with bacon and corn risotto, burger with regular fries, blackened chicken pita with sweet potato fries - All delicious!!!! 5"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place.  I went here last Saturday with my boyfriend and was immediately impressed with the decor.  It's so pretty and rustic, and the food on other diner's plates looked amazing.  We started with the pretzel pickle chips ($9).  They were really bland.  The breading was so thick and it had no pretzel flavor at all.  The dipping sauce didn't help.  Bland on bland on bland.  I ended up ordering the black bean burger after reading other reviews on yelp and was disappointed again.  I got maybe a dollop of goat cheese on my burger, but it was masked by the stale-tasting pepperidge farms bun. I didn't even finish it.  The side salad that came with it, however was great! No iceberg lettuce, all fancy greens."}
{"text":"Used to be great.  We would eat several times a week.  Now mediocre at best.  New chef took changed menu and now no longer worth the calories.  Tasteless Philly, and cheese sauce tasted like it came from a jar.  Greek Chicken wrap had maybe a 1/2 teaspoon of \"zesty\" yogurt dressing.  Blah!  Fries scorched, and the wings, which used to be the best are over cooked and flavorless.  What a disappointment!  Off to Forage in Lakewood or Taki's in Avon Lake next time where we KNOW we'll have consistently great food!"}
{"text":"Market is okay... kinda overpriced and the HH menu changed for the worse... meh. The place is good looking, but lacks personality, character."}
{"text":"Good for apps and drinks. Don't bother with any entrees though. Overpriced and disappointing.  Its hard to mess up lobster ravioli but the chef at market found a way. As soon as the plate was delivered I knew this was going to be bad. The ravioli are completely churched up and buried underneath what were obviously frozen rock shrimp, plain mussels, and smothered in an orange sauce that was supposed to be a spinach lobster cream...but was simply fishy and lacking any depth. After eating my way through everything hiding the ravs I finally tasted them and they don't mesh with anything else on the plate. Sweet claw meat filling and the fishy/briney sauce. Bad mix. A jumbled confusing mess. After tasting everyone else's dishes at the table it became clear the chef is trying to hard without a real understanding of what he's trying to do. Delish fried pickles and tater tot apps though!!! -Prosciutto wrapped chicken was bone dry and surprisingly flavorless.  -Fried perch was the best dish at the table. Fried crispy with house cut fries. But nothing set it apart from any bar fish fry -Paprikash was decent. But again smothered in the sauce covering every other flavor that may have been present."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch. I'm glad someone in my group made a reservation as it was very busy. The complimentary valet parking was a nice convenience. I had eggs Benedict and a Moscow mule. The drink was excellent, the food was ok. Atmosphere was great but everything was quite pricy. I'm not sure if I would return, possibly just for drinks and light bites."}
{"text":"My mom and I went to Market for the first time yesterday, after hearing rave reviews.  The decor and atmosphere was just beautiful.    The food was ok - nothing special.  I ordered the beef sliders, which had 2 different cheeses, pickles (yuck) and chip dip.  Also a side of sweet potato fries.  The sliders were good, the sweet potato fries, I think were frozen ones. Loved the basket the fries came in!  My mom ordered an $11 BLT.  Although there were 6 pieces of bacon on it, there was also shredded lettuce and pink (not red) tomatoes - the lettuce made it a little difficult to eat.  She also got the sweet potato fries.      Our service was average, the waitress kept our water glasses full, however, when I made a comment of how I was allergic to pickles, she didn't care.  Then when she asked how everything was and I said \"I guess it's ok\" she didn't care.    The only other thing I thought was odd was that the waitress/bartender had very, very short shorts on, which I thought was odd in such a nice place."}
{"text":"Lousy food,  lousy service,  won't be back. Screwed up our orders, had blackened ahi tuna tacos, soggy cold , inedible. Daughter asked for no onion, you guessed it, got onion."}
{"text":"Had some beers on the patio.  Patio is nice, and we especially liked the fire pit.  Server was pretty slow considering how empty the place was. The website says they're open until midnight on Thursdays.  We definitely were getting the vibe that the staff was too busy closing up to provide good service, and it wasn't even 11:00 yet."}
{"text":"I went here for a happy hour for a friend's birthday. We sat out on the enclosed patio, and even though it wasn't completely open since it was chillier out, it was super nice. I ordered the veggie quesadilla, which was HUGE. And it was so delicious. The tortilla was like a roasted red pepper or tomato flavor, which I have never even heard of before, but it worked so well with the flavors in the quesadilla. I had a sampling of the roasted cauliflower dip and the deep fried risotto balls (I can't remember the name of them and the happy hour menu is not on their website), and both were amazing. In addition, I also got a mojito-like drink from the happy hour menu, which I also cannot remember the name of and there is no happy hour menu online (*hint for the restaurant ... unless it changes too often).   The service was also great ... no complaints there."}
{"text":"Here for the first time yesterday for brunch. Crab cake eggs benedict was delightful, mkt fries - potato wedges - were cooked to perfection. Husband said his breakfast burrito was very good as well. Service was also good, friendly, seemed to be having a good time.   That last star sits on the drink though, the spiked blood orange mimosa was certainly tasty, but I guess I expected a little more spike. I mean, don't get me wrong, I got two just to be sure...    All in all, I know we'll be returning again.  Cool atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review based on my brunch experience- which was fantastic!  Our server was awesome and had the best personality. We had a small child in our party and she was awesome with her. I also liked the fact that when we walked in our table was all set with pre-poured waters!  I am not a bloody mary fan but a few of my friends ordered them and got to make their own using the bloody mary cart and they all gave it rave reviews. a few of them stated that the choices were not only awesome but they give you a decent amount of vodka. I ordered the Spiked Mango Passion Fruit Mimosa- it was awesome!!  For my entree I ordered the Chicken and Waffles. Something about corn and jalapenos in a waffle was something I could not pass up and I am sure glad I didn't! The chicken was juicy and had a perfect crisp on the outside.  Next up...Trying out their happy hour!"}
{"text":"Best bloody Mary bar I have encountered. They have about 9-12 different selections of stuffed olives and I think I tried them all. Local bloody Mary blend option as well as local bacon. The owner is usually at the cart to offer suggestions as well. Definitely worth it if you are in the mood on a Sunday brunch. The food was tasty as well."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group on Thursday night..Joe was our server, and he was awesome! Suggested some apps for us we got the mussels and crab risotto balls, they were both really good! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Market about 6 times and it never really knocked my socks off. It's decent enough. The last few times I've been there for brunch and I really like the options on the brunch menu as it's more creative than a lot of places. Plus they have a pear mimosa that is heaven (and a Bloody Mary bar).  Most recently, I had the waffle sliders which were really great, and a few weeks later the chicken and waffles which I didn't enjoy at all.   I find the valet parking kind of annoying and unnecessary. I also think the menus are a bit overpriced for what actually appears on the plate and how it tastes.   The atmosphere and decor is nice. The service is good too.  It's a large place with a huge patio for outdoor dining/drinking/relaxing and that's a definite plus."}
{"text":"I used to like this place but the new menu is AWFUL. They took away the fried pickles which blows my mind."}
{"text":"This is my first review on Yelp, and I have chosen to review a restaurant where I received excellent service and excellent food, Market in Rocky River.  I grew up in Rocky River, specifically on this street, and Market is in the location of the old city impound lot. I initially found it hard to believe that this is the same building because it has been extensively modified to accommodate a spacious dining area and accompanying bar and patio. They offer free valet parking, but I always park on Ingersoll, the side street across from Market.  My server on my first visit was Amy, and she helped my girlfriend and me have a very nice experience. Consequently, I ask for Amy whenever I go and she has been most excellent.  For food, I have had the Cobb salad, the French Dip, the chicken wings, and the hamburger. Everything was well-plated and properly cooked, with the wings and the Cobb salad being stand-outs for me, although the French Dip is also very good. I like places where the kitchen cares about what the food looks like and tastes like, and I have never been disappointed with the food or the service.  I would recommend trying Market, and I would recommend asking for Amy."}
{"text":"had brunch with the wifey for the first time on a Sunday...service and atmosphere both okay.. both of our brunch meals we have ordered server informed that they sold out...really.?! Oncewe reordered and food arrived it was good.. wife ordered the California omelette and I had the breakfast burrito and I liked that they grilled burrito.. Will be back again and a must try at least once."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and was quite please. We had the bacon cheddar tots for an ap and they were fantastic. They came to u overcooked, very dark brown as they spent to much time in the frier. But they were still really tasty. Our party of 3 had a blast drinking their Moscow Mules as we waited for our entree. The server was very personable and attentive. We didn't have to wait long to eat, it was a Wednesday night. I had PROSCIUTTO CHICKEN PICATTA for dinner. It was OK. I think I would of prefered the if the chicken was grilled instead of fried, it was kind of dry and tough. The pasta was a little bland and needed more seasoning. More lemon, or basil, or garlic. I had to salt it to make it taste ok. Overall not a bad experience, I'd happily return to try something different."}
{"text":"Some friends and I decided to try this place on a Friday evening for a couple of drinks and a little food.   Parking: Complimentary valet is nice, since there seem to be lots of parking restrictions in that neighborhood. Looks like you can self park if there's space, but that was full when we went.   Hostess:  Greeted us promptly, our party of 3 was offered a choice of inside or outside.  We opted for outside -- very nice patio area.   Service:  Slloooooooooooowwwww, but very friendly and knowledgeable.  Took forever before a server dropped by with requisite beverage napkins or coasters or whatever.  My friends had some questions on the beer list and the server was able to give some nice recommendations.    Food:  We ordered two appetizers -- calamari special appetizer and buffalo chicken dip.  Calamari was delicious.  Buffalo chicken dip was good, but nothing spectacular.  I thought the tortilla chips were a little too thick, but that's me being purely fussy.  My friends split the beef brisket reuben, I ordered their cheeseburger.  The server had offered to split the reuben onto two plates for my friends, which I thought was nice.  However,  one half of the sandwich came out, but not the other.  Server circled back about 5-10 minutes later and realized my friend was missing his half of the sandwich.    Price: High side of moderate.    Would I go back?  Probably, but not for any kind of wow-factor meal. My friends and I thought the happy hour specials looked good, so we'll try that next."}
{"text":"I went off script and ordered one of their featured drinks, the orange crush; It was too sweet for my taste.  I had the ahi tuna tacos as an entrée and they were equally disappointing. The tortillas were cold and the tuna didn't taste like it was seasoned with anything, but it did have a spicy mayo drizzle on it. The tacos were served with chips and salsa but the salsa was bland and didn't really taste like anything.  The only redeeming factor is that it was happy hour and the drinks were cheap."}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty cool.  There was a really nice outside area and a large bar.  The bartenders seemed a little grumpy and they took a very long time to take an order even though the bar wasn't very crowded.  I still liked it though."}
{"text":"My first visit to Market would have warranted a 5 star rating. The delicious Seasame Crusted Ahi Tuna, the Baked Banana Hammocks, the wine, the inviting atmosphere, the attentive server, they were all great.  My third visit?   Not so much. Upon entering the restaurant we were told we could be seated outside immediately, then they changed their minds, it was 15 minutes, then they changed their minds again - they could seat us inside in 5 minutes, then they changed their minds a third time - we couldn't be seated for another 30 minutes (even though tables were open) because the kitchen is backed up and they weren't allowed to fill up the tables. WHAT? At least sit us down at a table and suggest some wines! Perhaps a Belgian Style ale? Nope, no such luck. We waited about 35 minutes. Then we were seated.  The waiter?   He totally forgot my drink order. *Completely* missed our appetizer order. Then ignored our table for the majority of the meal.  The food?   Our Baked Banana Hammocks and the Little Piggies in a Blanket (that finally arrived after another reminder) were cold in the center. My boyfriend's Truffle Mac & Cheese was tasteless and required a good amount of salt. My Ahi Tuna was cut into four different size squares and awkwardly arranged - so much for food presentation.  Market, I'm going to chalk this one up to a bad night. I will return again. Please don't disappoint."}
{"text":"What a cute place! This little hidden gem is probably a place you would have to hear from word of mouth than actually see because it's not in a obvious location. I would come here again and again and again just for their mussels. Oh. My. Gosh. I don't think I've ever had such good mussels in my life. The burger I got on the other hand was basic and wasn't that great. But honestly- the mussels make up for it. It's very spacious inside with a long bar and on the side has a fireplace. Perfect to have a date or to come hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Nice place with a beautiful, large patio. Sort of high end pub grub. I like the ambience and the food prep but they don't have a very large selection for vegetarians. They are accommodating, but there are only a couple of things on the menu. Side veggies are nicely done - not mushy. We had good service when I went with a friend. The salmon entree he ordered was very undercooked and our waitress handled it very nicely."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at market. I came with my girlfriend and a friend for brunch around 1230 on a Sunday. I called 5 min before we walked in the door and we were told there were open tables for 3. We showed up and had to wait 10-15 min, not a big deal, but the buss people were pretty slow to clear off tables all over. We were greeted after about 10 min by an unenthusiastic waitress who lacked some courtesy. I could see if it were busy or we were being needy, but I felt like we weren't going to be served well, and we weren't. Didn't get a single water refill, and had to ask for cream with my coffee, it was not offered. The food was good, but not great, but that's alright as long as the service is good. I was not impressed, but will try it again before I write this place off"}
{"text":"My husband's chix - mush soup was to die for, my stuffed chicken with sweetpotatoe and green beans was good.  Service was good, getting beverage's from the bar takes too long !  Nice velet service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and location. The food is good but not exceptional, especially with the competition in the area. I gave it a 4 because of the atmosphere, happy hour prices, and brunch.   Pro's: Excellent happy hour prices and great location.   Cons: Parking lot is small, usually you have to park up the street. One thing that really bothers me is that the \"chef\" won't allow any changes to menu items. It's a pretty standard menu and reasonable customer request should be accommodated."}
{"text":"I wanted to send my brunch back . The eggs were dried out and a minuscule portion. No parking on site unless you use their valet.  Bathroom was filthy. Server ignored us except to take order, and drop off the bill."}
{"text":"Nothing but praise here- first time got the steak and eggs and Bloody Mary for brunch- all delicious I also had a bite of the breakfast burrito which was good as well. Clean place with a cool feel to it large bar and looks like lots of outdoor seating for warmer months. Our server was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place so much!  I'm dropping it to 2 stars and I've now been here probably a dozen times.  I'm still in love with the bloody mary cart.  Those olives with the yumminess stuffed inside with cheese, sausage...yum!  But then today I got my usual dish for brunch -- the chorizo waffle sliders.  The waffles were obviously burnt on one side and they tried to hide it by putting it in the middle of the sliders so it'd be a bit more hidden.  Did they think I wouldn't taste that?  I did and found the burnt side.  I didn't complain because I was super hungry and didn't want to wait for them to make another.  This place is thriving.  It was hard to get a reservation yesterday when I called for today for 6 people.  I'm continually baffled as to why they have valet parking...but again, it's quite full...so maybe I'm the idiot for parking a half block down the street for free?  Who knows...  Also, my friend, Abbe, who also posted a review here, dined with me this day. Please be sure to see her review."}
{"text":"Ambiance:  3.  Market features large, open areas as well as a pseudo open air kitchen.  Flat screens line the bar area and are featured intermittently through the main dining area.  There's also a nice semi-secluded glass fish bowl room for a larger party. But being off the main drags of Lakewood/Rocky River, just seems out of place for a nicer feel.  This is probably a 4 however in summertime, looks like they have a great outdoor patio.  Cost:  3. Sandwiches were in the low-teens, main meals were in the $18-$25 range which I'd classify as run of the mill average.  Draft beers were reasonable as well, ~$3-$4.  Food Quality: 3. Avoid the seafood if you're not in the heart attack business. Good main meal seafood choices, but wayyy too salty (I'm referring to the grouper and scallops in particular).  Some appetizers looked pretty good. Burgers/salads etc. seemed 'standard'.  Service: 4. Contrary to other reviewers, our service for a table of 6+ was actually quite good and we were there for an extended period of time. Valet parking service was very fast, although completely unnecessary other than to help reduce unemployment headcounts in Cleveland.  When to return: When multiple sports games are on at once you'd want to watch.  Summertime for the patio.  Half-special occasions (yes, half-special) for the secluded glass door room."}
{"text":"Used to love Market but sadly it seems to have fallen off in both quality and service in recent years. Everything started off fine this morning, we had a reservation for 10 for brunch. Service was a little slow but it was understandable due to the sheer amount of tables our waitress had to take care of. We ordered and the food arrived 25 minutes later and here is where my problem started. A food runner brought out one of several MKT breakfast's that were ordered and my wife told her it wasn't hers bc she ordered her eggs medium and these eggs were over easy. Instead of giving the plate to its rightful owner she shoved it in my wife's face and said medium and over easy is the same thing. Ok? So my wife handed the plate to another person in our party who did order their eggs over easy and the food runner stood there looking at us and was visibly annoyed. So she brings the rest of our food out, my wife gets her medium eggs and then the girl proceeds to call my son \"she\". My son is 15mos old was wearing jeans and a button down shirt. He looks, acts, and yells like a boy. I could only come to the conclusion that it was intentional bc she was annoyed that we wanted the correct food we ordered in front of us. I know such a ridiculous request. Anyway, I had the crab Benedict and it was cold and meh. The only thing good were the home fries. Sadly this is probably the last time we will have brunch here. Like I said I understand it was busy, things can be hectic, but to sit there and have someone visibly annoyed with you and question you on what you ordered...and all for food that was mediocre at best. I think it's best we part ways Market."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and the food has always been great. A little different than you'd expect for a \"beer place\", but very good. The valet makes it seem like this restaurant is more upscale than it really is, and I'm not too sure why they have valet anyway - parking can be tight in that area, but they have a pretty big lot on the premises."}
{"text":"We were a party of 6, having lots of wine, apps, and dinner. Our waitress and the waitress-in-training were great - excellent service.  The issue we have is with the management and the way they treated my aunt when she took a nasty fall when tripping over the step up to our table. She had just arrived at the restaurant (so she was sober) and didn't notice the poorly lit step. Not only was she embarrassed, she was in pain the rest of the night.  The manager came over  and immediately got defensive saying that they do their best to provide lighting under the step, then just walked away.  What he failed to to was ask what he could do to make her experience better. Even if he insisted on comping her drink, maybe even her dinner, or invite her to come back for a dinner on the house - anything to make her feel a little more appreciated, especially since we stayed, continued to order food and drinks, and tipped our waitresses.  Having worked in customer service and the restaurant industry myself for years, you do whatever you can to make sure your guests are comfortable, having a nice time, and leave saying they'd definitely come back.  Now, you have 6 people questioning if they will, along with telling others about their experience.  It was definitely a disappointing first-time experience for all of us. Not sure if we'll be back.  Also, my fish was very dry, I could tell my mashed potatoes weren't fresh, and the mandatory valet parking is a waste."}
{"text":"Enjoy brunch on the patio on a nice sunny day! The Bloody Mary bar here is one of the best I've seen. The Benedict is also very tasty. Try the mustard hollandaise sauce. Yum!"}
{"text":"A friend and I met here for lunch today. The first negative was that prices on their drink menu are only given for beer & wine and not for any cocktails, although they supposedly pride themselves on their Bloody Mary drinks. I first ordered their Swingsville Zinfendal, but was told it wasn't available, so I settled on a Motto Cabernet ($6.50 per glass). My friend and I both ordered the Chicken Paprikash soup ($6) ...absolutely perfect, especially as we both have a Slovak heritage and recall this being made often. I then ordered the Open-faced Pot Roast Sandwich with roasted red peppers & onion straws, plus a side of sweet potato fries ($12)...large portion, so I ended up taking half of it home. With the wine, soup, and sandwich, plus tax & tip, the bill came to $30, which I thought was a bit high for a lunch."}
{"text":"Drinks and atmosphere are good here but gets a bit loud because of the open space. Beer selection is decent and mixed drinks ok!   Dessert not so much, it was pre made and tasted like it was in a refrigerator with regular food :( Have not given the food menu a try but I hear the brunch is good.  The parking arrangement is weird, only valet at property or park elsewhere."}
{"text":"Over priced and just so so. Had a Manhattan, 1/2 vermouth, it was actually red.  Friends had the berry margarita, mostly juice.  No place to park and fair food.  Not a glowing recommendation."}
{"text":"Time heals all wounds.    That's how I feel about Market.  I went there last September shortly after they had opened for business, and had two very very bad experiences.  Mainly it was involved with the staff - from the hostess all the way to the bartenders.  There just seemed to be a general lack of interest in anyone doing their jobs, and essentially giving no attention to the paying customer.  In the back of my mind I wanted so badly to really like the place.  They've done a wonderful job with the layout of the establishment.  The restaurants concept of using a upscale farmers market approach was something rather new to me.  THANKFULLY, they seemed to have ironed out that rather major issue, and I have forgiven them for their past mistakes.  The bar area is very inviting with plenty of room to enjoy one of the many craft beers available, and there are a lot of them.  There are plenty of tables if you'd rather not belly up to the bar, and once the weather in CLE gives way they have those roll up doors one a large part of the side that will open to a very nice outdoor seating area.  While the place is a bit off of the beaten path I for one find that to be a good thing as it will keep the Tapout and Affliction wearing crowd to a minimum."}
{"text":"Food is really great and prices are right. The valet hurts sales and are pretty much fools and the tables are way too small. Waitresses are kind of slow and don't like clearing the tables. The atmosphere is cool though."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The food/menu is average, good but not fantastic. TV's, about ten of them going full blast, so loud you can't really converse without yelling. The second time the service was terrible, waitress served a dirty martini with no olives, half the party was served food 30 minutes before the rest. The manager did give us a discount for the poor service but that didn't really make the experience pleasant."}
{"text":"We had lunch here based in a rave review but came away disappointed. The veg options are few.  The food: so-so tasting, rather small entree Greek salad; huge Walleye sandwich; room temperature fries. The beer I wanted wasn't available, and the one I wanted instead ran out and I got the last half glass full. (It was comped, which I appreciated.)  The service: maybe it was because we had lunch on a holiday but they were understaffed with only two waiters on hand. But they were both extremely nice, accommodating and apologetic.  The decor: Im not sure what they're going for. Mongolian castle meets Applebee's is what I can come up with. It's a huge place and great for groups and, during the day, families.  Overall, not my thing."}
{"text":"Went for a night cap and desert.  This place is always cool to hang out.  Waiter was very friendly and was kind enough to look up Shandy (as in Shandy Summer Ale)."}
{"text":"I returned again recently and although it's still cute and has decent food, I can't believe the prices for the apps. The sandwich and meal prices are alright for a slightly higher scale place, but $14 for hush puppies and $12 for cheese curds insane. It seems the prices for the apps have risen since I was last there."}
{"text":"Great bar, food, drinks, and service! Will go for the mussels again! Market is comfortable even dining at the bar. Staff was very attentive"}
{"text":"We had our holiday party here for work last year. It was awesome! Grabbed drinks and apps here after work one day this week. The food here is pretty good and the prices are pretty good for drinks. Have an extensive beer list. Lots of variety on the menu too!"}
{"text":"Four of us made a reservation for Sunday brunch. We were seated promptly and friendly and given menus and decided on the Bloody Marys. They were very good and the bloody mary cart was filled with all different kinds of flavored olives and bacon and many cheeses. As we were enjoying our drinks a server came over with several plates of food and asked who got what and we said well we haven't even put our order in yet. In a few minutes our server came and we put in our order three of us had corned beef hash and the other had the frittata. The dishes didn't take very long to arrive but we were somewhat disappointed in the type of corned beef that was used in the dish. It was like slices of corned beef from a deli were ground and it wasn't very moist. It tasted very good but it wasn't what we were looking for the frittata was very good. We were asked what type of toast or muffin we wanted with our brunch and they did not come at all and when they finally did bring them it was after we had finished the rest of our breakfast. All in all it was a fairly good experience, it started to get very busy as we were leaving which was about 12:30, although it was not that busy when we were there to have had such confusion about our meals."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous place. I was treated to lunch here on a beautiful summer Saturday in Cleveland. We sat on their gorgeous patio. The location is perfect. The food and service was fabulous. I had the stuffed chicken as recommended by my server. It was really delicious. It consisted of a chicken breast stuffed with chorizo and other yummy things, sweet potatoes and fresh green beans. I also had a ginger beer which was extremely refreshing. I will definitely be back on my next trip."}
{"text":"I liked it. Good food. Good beers. Great feeling patio. Really like that they accomodate groups and outings so well in a catered setting.   We sat on the patio. It was a warm summer night. The sun was in the midst of setting but taking its good 'ol time. I had a lot of food. Started off with a Southern Tier Pumking brew, Chick Paprikash Soup, then some lamb sliders. All very delish.   We will definitely return for additional dining experiences both inside, outside and at the bar. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Well, I guess something was up my butt when I wrote this original review, because I have been back several times since and love Market. The patio is awesome, everything I have ordered has been great and it's always a place I recommend to people. Why was I so judgmental Market? I'm sorry, I'm so very, very sorry :)"}
{"text":"Pretty solid food, staff, and drinks. Often I go there when I want to watch a game and have some fried pickles."}
{"text":"First, I don't want to blame our waiter Justin while he didn't exceed or meet all of our needs he was nice and had  a warm personality. As a nurse I know that some little things get forgotten in the big picture so I can let that go. But we made reservations for a birthday celebration   when everyone would be available. To find that most things were off the menu and that the bloody mary bar was slim to none picking was unacceptableThat we couldn't order from another menu after discovering most brunch items were gone was unacceptable. What we were left with was just so so not very tasty food. We maintained our politeness but we were not happy at all and undoubtably will not return ever again. We left feeling unsatisfied and wishing we ad picked any other place. Even the valet parking refused to park our car. All in all it made my daughter day less of a celebration and more of something to just get thru. I know she felt a little slighted especially when the pumpkin cheesecake was no longer available. Justin we appreciate your gift of Apple Carmel cheesecake. It was thoughtful."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the market for the first time last Saturday night and we were pleasantly surprised to get seated right away. The service was a little slow at first but got better.  I ordered the chicken tortilla salad and it was pretty good but not sure it was worth $13. My niece orders mac & cheese everywhere she goes and when she inquired about the Market mac & cheese she wasn't sure she should order it. We were told it was made with a goat cheese sauce and had rosemary as a seasoning. I strongly discouraged her figuring she wouldn't like it but she decided to take a chance. I'm so glad she did because it was fabulous! I'm not a fan of mac & cheese since it's usually bland but the flavor and texture of the Market mac & cheese was outstanding! The roasted red pepper noodles were delicious and the herb roasted chicken was so soft and there was plenty of it. The goat cheese sauce wasn't overpowering and it had just the right amount of rosemary seasoning. My niece ended up loving it and I think she was annoyed that my fork kept finding it's way over to her plate! I was paying the bill so she couldn't say much! Normally, I would say $17 was pricey for mac & cheese but this one was worth it. My friend had the market chopped salad which was nothing special and we all shared the fried pickles as an appetizer which were pretty good. I'll definitely return and I know what I'll be ordering!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, decor was nice... limited parking so I would suggest not to go at a busy time. I got the goat cheese chicken salad... so good!!!"}
{"text":"It's so nice driving up to the complimentary valet service. The valet remembered us from last time. As soon as we walked in... we met our favorite server, Christopher, at the reception desk. He takes great care of all of his customers. If you like seafood, you will definitely like The Market in Rocky River! My husband and I visited The Market this past Saturday. The seared scallops, which is served on top of a bed of risotto and sesame tuna were cooked to perfection. Next time you are in the mood for some nice ambiance, good food, and great service make sure you visit The Market and ask that Christopher take care of you!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  The Mexican Street corn dip was flat awful.  The food was honestly nothing to write home about.  The waitress really didn't fill drinks.... honestly disappointed.  Have been there in the past and food was good but a big miss on the recent trip."}
{"text":"Food is always good and service. Been here many times.   Had the Pickels and baby potato skins-Happy Hour Specials. Both  were excellent.   Then I had the Pastrami. Holy Cow! One of the best I've ever had!  Plentiful amount of fries with that too."}
{"text":"Such great food awesome service and a cozy environment. Also amazing bloody Mary's!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on Mother's Day and sat up at the bar. Not only did the bartender ignore us the entire time, our food took at least an hour for simple eggs, they were out of peach for mimosas and a food runner was the only person to check on the food. Our food wasn't even hot when it came out. Horrible experience. I've been coming here for years and do not want to return after that. Save your money."}
{"text":"The manager did reach out and offer a return visit - I politely declined. While I will give many places a second chance, I explained that my time is more valuable than the money we spent at Market - and the entire experience there was so uniformly bad, that I don't think the staff earned a second chance."}
{"text":"Went for a nice family dinner and enjoyed the meal.   Way overpriced for what was received.   Ordered the pirogies which were excellent (~ $20) Portion size was the problem. Should be listed as an appetizer.  Other meals at the table all looked very good. Didn't try any of them but wouldn't have balked if offered.   Very nice decor (clean and well organized).   Service was ok.  Just ok"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch, great service, and a perfect Bloody Mary !! A must try during your Cleveland visit"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place hasn't been reviewed before, Urbanspoon has quite a few reviews.   The concept of Market is great. A slightly upscale sports bar, yes, it's been done a million times before, but not in RR. The servers at Market are fantastic, but the bartenders are a joke. Unless you're a rich guy from Westlake or Avon and the bartender has seen you a hundred times, expect looooong waits for another round. Incredibly inattentive and inept, I've left empty glasses and 20s sitting in front of me for as long as 15 minutes before someone noticed. The Reuben I had was tough as leather and not very good. I went back for brunch and the food was pretty decent... I think it depends on who's working in the kitchen. Better management would make this place really take off."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch on Sunday's also good tacos Thursday drinks are great service is great complimentary valet parking on Sunday's"}
{"text":"I went on half price wine night during happy hour and sat at the bar. Delicious $5 appetizers and great wine selection. The bartenders were very knowledgable about the wines and kept our white chilled behind the bar and our glasses full. Great experience and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious but the wait for the food was a bit long. We went at 3:00 for late lunch early dinner so the place wasn't too busy. Aside from the wait we enjoyed our food and would come back."}
{"text":"Was pretty excited to come here from Toledo and try something different for a change. The valet is weird. At least it's free (I did tip). Our waitress was a little slow and our food got brought out wrong and she came back later and expected someone in our group to give the other person whose toast never got brought out hers, lol. It was very pretty out and I liked the ambiance and music but the food was sub par. Prices were great but was expecting better entrees."}
{"text":"The food is alright needs improvement, the service needs improvement. I sat in the front for about 3 minutes waiting to be seated. There's no parking and we had to park about a quarter-mile down the street."}
{"text":"First time at the Market on Saturday for happy hour. They have a really nice happy hour. Had lots of fun. Service was great beers were cold. We had a few different appetizer all were good EXCEPT the HUMMUS so plain no flavor a bit different.  I have heard this from a few other people also. But all in all great place."}
{"text":"They did it again!! We received the greatest seat out in the patio section.  We keep coming for the sunday brunch and we love it !  I will always come to market for brunch and dinner, you know what?  I'll come to hangout too. I love the bar."}
{"text":"Lowering the rating to three stars because I'm just not impressed with this place. Ordered a variety of food and it was all pretty underwhelming, and not to mention pricey for what you get. Not bad, just a bit mediocre."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary bar is great for Sunday brunch. Food is bland"}
{"text":"To start, I went here and was in kind of a crappy mood. Kind of a crappy day overall.  This sit us outside at the huge patio that they have, good start. It was really nice out there.  Ordered drinks, sweet, they got Magic Hat and a few other east of the Mississippi classics that I can't get back in my new home SLC, Utah.  Ordered food, got the stuffed chicken.  Whoa...now...that's...damn good!  It's funny how food can turn one's day completely around and I have to admit that Market's stuffed chicken is a must try because it was some of the best I've ever had and put a smile on my face. Stuffed with sausage and cheese and covered in a sauce that I can't remember what it was. Not only was the chicken good but the veggies were actually tasty. I typically just eat veggies cause they're there, but I wish I had a second helping of them. Then the side pasta salad that comes with it too, was just delicious and refreshing from the rest of the dish. A++ for food, I want to come back immediately.  Thanks for brightening my day!"}
{"text":"I try and try and try again because really the location is a perfect meeting spot between me and my west side friends... but Market always disappoints. Cold food, awful presentation, lackluster service and items that don't resemble the menu. The only reason I've given it two stars is because the beer selection doesn't suck. I'd love for them to figure out the issues in the kitchen and actually put out some good food. Until then, I try to avoid it."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was outstanding!! Great brunch menu. They have delicious cocktails and a Bloody Mary bar with 36 optional ingredients! I had a pear mimosa and the Broccoli Skillet which was so good. Good prices, would definitely go back. They do take reservations and were busy so I recommend it."}
{"text":"Excellent first time experience! Beer list was full of craft choices, and the boursin cheese bite appetizer was amazing. We had the goat cheese salad and the porky mac-n-cheese. Holy crap, I never realized pork belly was so freakin' good! The parking situation seems to have something to do with the ground level patio that extends directly into the restaurant, and nothing to do with being pretentious. We actually parked right down the street and enjoyed Mitchell's Ice Cream for dessert! Two-fer combo!"}
{"text":"I finally got to go to the Market for brunch a few weeks ago. When we got to the restaurant we realized that the lot was only for valet parking so if you don't want to pay there are lots of other lots nearby you can park and walk a little. We were seated on the patio right away. It was the perfect spot for Sunday brunch!  They had such a large brunch menu I really had a tough time choosing what to order (and everything sounded so good!!) If you're looking for a brunch drink they had a ton of mimosa flavors and a build your own bloody mary bar. I was told this had a crazy amount of toppings to choose from.   I wanted to choose something different for my order but settled on the veggie omelet. I figured the veggies that came in this were different than what normally come in one so I tried it. It was good, but I didn't think it had a ton of flavor.   The service was also extremely slow. Since we were on the patio our waitress may have had other tables inside, but it seemed like a lot of people waited for their food and servers for a while. I've heard this is an issue here and it seems to be true.   I would come back again for brunch and to try their happy hour and dinner menus."}
{"text":"My cousin suggested Market for lunch. There were five of us and we each ordered a different meal. I had the hot chicken biscuit sliders with sweet potato fries. The fries were very crispy and the sliders were hot, spicy crunchy and the tony packo pickles were awesome!!  I loved it and without going into detail all the other ppl at the table enjoyed their food immensely. Our waitress was a sweetheart and the atmosphere was cozy and chic. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"No restaurant gets higher than two stars when the service is so bad our business group of five asked for the check after drinks and apps and left early. That's what happened to our group on a recent Thursday night at the Market. To the management: I hope it was just a bad server or a short-handed kitchen. But there's no excuse for being seated over an hour and not having your entree even ordered. We were constantly looking for our server-a surefire buzzkill during a business/social dinner.   I kinda get it-Maybe this place is so popular and trendy that the trendy servers get a little nonchalant toward professional table service. By the way, the place was not full, there were several empty tables and no one waiting when we left.  Lastly, the food is good. Wish I could have experienced more."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a couple of drinks and an appetizer but I was very happy. The atmosphere was beautiful and the hostess was very nice. Even though we weren't having dinner she didn't have a problem seating us at a table, which was nice. The on tap list was great, a lot of variety and not overpriced, and the appetizer, ahi tuna, was fantastic. It was accompanied by some of the best seaweed salad that I've ever had. While the service itself left a bit to be desired my visit here was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Friendly (if perhaps over-friendly) service that doesn't always know when to get out of the way but partially compensates with its attentiveness. Food is very mixed with certain basic American gastropub fare (e.g. fried mac n cheese, burgers) a success and other more specialty dishes (e.g. chicken/biscuits/gravy, chicken spaetzel) falling flat. Wide, decent beer selection. However, there are massive big-screen TVs blaring bad cable news on almost every wall, so atmospherically you'll have nothing more than a pure bar experience."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Last time I was there everything was just alright, nothing to rave about. Except the wings and the fried Mac and cheese that my friends got. Would I ever order dessert here again? Probably not. Service is sometimes awesome (like last night) and sometimes just ok. Brunch is amazing, especially the Bloody Mary bar, oh and the mimosa cart ."}
{"text":"My first visit was worth five stars, second time as well, third time for apps and drinks, just four. The bartender, who was also a manager, was cool. The menu changes frequently I feel. I really like the place itself, it's really nice. I like the location, and the romantic feel. It's pricey though and I think if they had a few less expensive options, they could bring in more business. Overall, a very nice date place!"}
{"text":"Do not waste your money here. We have been here to eat approximately 4 times. The first time, the server was delightful and attentive and our food was pretty decent. The quality of food and service declined steadily with our other visits and this last time was the worst.  Our party consisted of my older parents, my two young children and my fiancé and I and we had just come from church. They sat us right by the bar on a day that the Browns were playing. It was so loud that we couldn't hold a conversation unless it was with the person sitting directly next to us. Our server was inattentive to say the least. She appeared to be disinterested, had to be stopped in order to ask gor things, and had the personality of a chewed up Fig Newton. The other servers were equally as lousy, the gentleman who dropped off our food told us that he couldn't get us refills (we thought that since we hadn't seen our server in awhile that maybe he could help).  The food was bland, lacked flavor and was soggy. My mother and I ordered the monte cristo and it was soggy. My daughters ordered pancakes that were decent .... but were very thick and came with a thimble sized amount of syrup. We had to chase the server down in order to request more syrup ... by the time it came the pancakes were cold. The bloody mary that I ordered was chunky, much like the consistency of tomato soup.  The place is cool if you're a wealthy hipster who likes to watch the Browns game at a trendy place and over pay for a flute of mimosa, otherwise it sucks. Four times here was four times too many and we work too hard for our money to spend it at an over priced bar."}
{"text":"Have you ever heard of the Bloody Mary bar? That's right. Not only you get to order this hair of the dog kind of drink without any shame and remorse, you can also parade towards the mini-bar with all kinds of garnish for the drink: celery, sausage, small kielbasa, and even pepperchini. That's all that I noticed passing by of course. I had one remarkable Sunday brunch here and really liked my veggie skillet with goat cheese. I briefly scanned the menu and promised myself to come back here : everything sounded very delicious and eclectic. When I came back on Mother's day with two more people, I realized that I stepped into the trap: charming exotic menu was gone, every hungry soul walking in was being charged $28 plus tax for the all you can eat buffet. Since I swore the place was great, we stayed. Breakfast buffet was blah: very limited choices ( the only highlighs were chicken and waffles and crepe bar), cold at times, and at times very stale. Sadly we had to pay $110 for the brunch to find that out. I still have a good faith in the place and plan to return to try out their tomato jam. Hope they are not going to buffet me around again."}
{"text":"love the market for a few things, but have to say the food is not one of them. i think their menu is just mediocre. nothing that really screams, try me or i have to return here to get THAT again....... with that being said, they have taco thursdays, which i used to think was super delish. $3.00 tacos with about 6 different choices, plus the taco of the day. returned for this last night and was disappointed in them. not sure if it was later (8:30ish, so not like bar closing time) but my shell was hard (they are soft flour normally) on one of them and the other was just plain. i have raved to so many about these tacos, but last night they did not have their A game on.  the other food on the menu as stated earlier is just ok. there is nothing that really stands out and everything i have tried has just been alright. however, i do like their brunch. hello bloody mary bar, if you're in to that sort of thing. be prepared to wait (insert, make a reservation. you're welcome)  the outside patio is great for dining al fresco on a nice summer night. great place to watch the game, lots of tvs in the bar. however, i have always felt that the bartenders at the market, never really go out of their way for you and you almost feel like you are bothering them when you ask a question. this has ALWAYS been the case here and i have been here probably about 15-20 times. i like friendly bartenders who welcome questions, especially about their featured drinks and the beers on tap. last night, i went to ask a question about the beers on tap, (i wanted to ask if they had a pumpkin beer they could suggest) and before i even got the words out, the bartender slapped a menu in front of me and said these are what we have on tap. hello. RUDE. i was trying to ask a question. so anyway, like i said, i love friendly bartenders. makes your dining/drinking experience so much more pleasurable.  anyway, i keep returning to the market, so i must not dislike it, right?!  check them out. if not for anything else, their patio is gorgeous ;)"}
{"text":"Showed up on a Sunday for the bloody Mary bar. When we walk in there was no one waiting.  But we were told there's a 20 minute wait. Many empty tables and seats from the eyes can see. So we left. Shouldn't tell your customers there's a wait when no one else is waiting. Get rid of your velet parking attendance if your short on help."}
{"text":"Happy Hour specials for beer and wine are reasonable. Select appetizers are half off during happy hour as well.  Environment is quaint and classy, but the servers tend to be slow and my friends and I felt rushed to get out.  Complimentary valet or parking across the street."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. Service was extremely slow and the restaurant was not that crowded. I was not in a rush so I didn't mind. I got the Bloody Mary bar which was a little over whelming and breakfast burrito. Food was great!"}
{"text":"Service was sub par.  The gravy on the poutine appetizer was delicious but the potatoes were undercooked and the curds were tasteless.  The chicken in the chicken sandwich was tough and the corned beef was lunch meat."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed with Market. I used to come for the happy hour and they changed the menu. They used to have delicious chicken quesadillas but now they don't. Then I went for brunch yesterday and they were out of most of the menu. They said sorry but we weren't allowed to order off the regular menu. They won't be getting my business anymore."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! They have a large inside area and outside dining area. There is both covered and uncovered parts of the patio. The decor is modern yet classy.   The staff is very helpful and genuine. I had the southwest salad and it was amazing! The salads are page and really full you for lunch. My friend had a salmon Caesar salad and she said that the salmon was cooked perfectly! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I see so much potential, but I don't think Market is for me. It pains me to ever leave anything less then or 4 or 5 stars. We came to Market for dinner on a less busy night before a movie.   In total, we were there for 1hr and 45 minutes. Yikes. Luckily, we got there early. But I don't recommend choosing Market if there's somewhere you need to be. The service doesn't carry a sense of urgency. I don't expect lightening fast, but after you've been sitting in a wooden chair for almost 2 hours, you're just going to be itching to get to wherever you need to be next.  The drink menu doesn't include any prices, which is just a pet peeve. I know, I know, if you have to ask, you can't afford, but I just appreciate knowing. I don't see many CLE area restaurants that omit prices anymore. Luckily, my delicious cocktail turned out be a reasonable price, but you never know. As for dinner, I ordered the short ribs. When the food arrived, it was lukewarm. The mashed potatoes were cold. It was clear the entree had maybe been sitting for a while, but I didn't want to send it back, as we were quite hungry and I didn't want to risk missing our movie. The short ribs themselves were tender and juicy. I imagine the entree is more inviting when its warm.  The interior is really modern and fun, and they have a great ambiance. I hear that their brunch is better, so i'd be willing to come back and try that in the future to update my review. While the restaurant is beautiful, I don't think i'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I haven't been in a few months, but it's a HUGE space. I think it might go on forever. Last time I went we were kind of off in our own area, which was great because we were 4 friends catching up and we tend to get loud. There was mac and cheese on the menu, which is the direct route to my heart, and it was delish!"}
{"text":"The hostesses are clueless in this place.  Walked in on a Sunday at noon for brunch.  Many tables were open yet it took nearly 30 minutes to seat us.  Service was very slow.  Food was decent but unfortunately not good enough to make up for the overall poor experience."}
{"text":"I wish I liked Bloody Marys more (or at all) because then I would like Market more. To be fair, I've only been once, & I usually try to reserve judgment or online review until I've been more than once, but this place rubbed me the wrong way right off the bat. My boyfriend & I went in on a Sunday, expecting a bit of a wait, but when we got in, we found that nearly every table was empty, except for a few. Absolutely no one was waiting - & yet we were told that it would be \"at least 30 minutes.\" For whom? Reservations that hadn't come in yet? A whole restaurant full of them? The hostesses seemed bored & snooty, & they looked notably surprised when we said we wanted to put our name in anyway.   We walked over to the bar for drinks in the meantime, which was packed with people who had presumably made the same decision. We did find two seats together, & we decided we may as well just eat at the bar, where at least the bartender was friendly & kind, unlike his coworkers at the host stand.   The food was good, & there was a lot of it. I was slightly disappointed by the \"waffle sliders,\" which I imagined to be, like... sliders. Instead, it was basically an omelet made with waffle halves instead of egg - one big waffle sandwich that, or a waffle taco. I had to eat it with a fork because it was incredibly messy, but it was also incredibly delicious, so I give it a pass. I think it was a little bit misrepresented on the menu, though. The boyfriend got the breakfast burger, which he devoured, & we split their fries, which were A+. Beer & mimosas to drink.  The bill was a little bit more expensive than I normally would like to spend for Sunday brunch, especially seated at a bar, but the food was decent & the company, at least was good - and, OK, so was the bartender, who was working his tail off to serve all the people who somehow couldn't get tables in an empty restaurant. I'd probably go back, but I'd be sure to make reservations."}
{"text":"What a debacle.    Stopped by on a sunny Sunday afternoon to enjoy lunch with my boyfriend and his parents.  We were seated on the patio and then were forgotten about.  It was hot out, so getting drinks in a timely manner would have been appreciated.  My boyfriend's parents are nice but do ask servers a lot of questions, and I think that turned out server off.  He was pretty much absent throughout our entire meal and got an attitude if we dared ask for anything extra.  (Was getting me more water really all that difficult, dude?)  We started out with the fried pickle appetizer.  It was ok.  Not sure I was a fan of the pretzel crust or the onion dip that came along with them, but...they were alright.  My boyfriend's Moscow mule was almost undrinkable because it was so sweet and gingery.  I ordered pretty much the only vegetarian item on the brunch menu - a fried goat cheese salad.  I like goat cheese, but wow!  I got a hockey puck sized piece of it.  I think that would be a bit much for anyone to stomach.    My boyfriend and his parents all enjoyed the French Dip sandwich they ordered.  His mother enjoyed hers a bit less because she's lactose intolerant and had asked for no cheese on her sandwich.  If our waiter had asked us if our meals had come our alright, we might have been able to tell him.  Overall, a very  disappointing experience. I'd been to Market for a special event last fall and had enjoyed my brunch but the poor service and snippy attitude of our server coupled with my less than awesome food gives me no reason to want to go back."}
{"text":"I've been here many times for dinner, lunch, brunch, or just drinks on a Saturday night. I have mixed feelings about Market depending on the occasion for my visit.   On the positive side, Market is in a good location with a good vibe. This always seems like a logical choice when I'm in town and need a place to meet up with friends for lunch, brunch, or drinks. The brunch menu is pretty solid and they have a large Bloody Mary bar. Everything I've had for brunch has been delicious and the portions are light so I don't leave needing a nap. The lunch options are pretty good and I've never had a problem getting in for lunch. I like coming here for drinks because they have indoor and outdoor seating options. It's a good setting to just have a drink and hang out with friends. It can get loud inside on weekend nights, but the outdoor seating allows for having conversation.   I'm consistently happy with the food here. The food is pretty good and the menu has a nice variety. My favorite item is the chicken paprikash soup. I also enjoy the pork tenderloin with the apple and pear topping.   The only thing that holds me back from being really enthused mainly lies in my most recent dinner here with a friend. The service was really awkward and slow. Unfortunately, service can be a miss here and isn't consistently good or friendly."}
{"text":"Cute Place. We were here for a private reception and so had the menu for that. There was a sweet potato appetizer that was divine and very tasty. The hips were crisp and well salted but not oily. All the rest of the food was more typical bar food. The servers who worked the event were prompt and helpful and attentive to our group. I can recommend for a group event."}
{"text":"Very modern/cool looking place inside and out!! I finally had a chance to give Market a taste at United We Brunch. Their samples were great and they gave out a complimentary mimosa card to use back at the restaurant (great idea!).    When we went for brunch the restaurant is set up nicely but they will seat you in direct sunlight since the windows/garages are so large and that's where a majority of the non-reserved tables seem to be. Luckily they were accommodating and said if we are done within 3 hours we can have non-direct light seating...no problem at all!   The menu isn't extensive but prices are decent and so is the food. I was not blown away by the pancakes but will go back to try something else, so Market still remains on the brunch line up. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"We've been here about 6 or 7 times since it opened and think it's a great place to eat/drink. As far as apps go, we love the boursin bites (ask for extra tomato jam- it's SO delish) and the pretzel pickles with homemade onion dip. My favorite entrée is the prosciutto wrapped chicken (to die for!) and my husband loves the chicken paprikash (especially the spaetzle).  My husband is very happy with the beer selection, and I love their cocktail menu-- lots of interesting choices and it keeps improving over time. The service has always been excellent, and their outside patio is AWESOME in the summer! The only thing that keeps me from giving them 5 stars is their dessert menu. They do try to put together some great concepts, but they lack in execution. Example: this last time I had the Guinness chocolate cake (with Baileys frosting). Sounds amazing, but in reality it was definitely not very fresh. This is the 3rd time I've had a lackluster dessert, so from here out I might save my sweet tooth for an ice cream stop on the way home :)    Last night the server told us about their Thursday taco night, we'll be back to try that out soon."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks, nice and clean, fun enviroment, good patio.  Try the scallops - excellent.  Overall for the price it was what I would expect."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with the family and I really enjoyed my blackened chicken pita. Our server was very nice and when the kitchen ran out of the roast beef  for others in the group she was very apologetic. I'm from out of town, but have family in the area, plan on coming back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Two stars is really generous, and mostly reflects the fact that it looks pretty nice inside, and they have a solid patio. The big letdown here is service, which is amazingly bad. Slow is one thing. Slow and incompetent is another level. Slow, incompetent and unable/unwilling to resolve issues? That's a trifecta worthy of the Triple Crown, and I've seen it happen here enough times to wonder how people like me (I've given this place fifth and sixth chances due to its proximity to my house) keep coming back. The food might be OK, but it's hard to tell when your entree comes after your dining companion has finished their entree. If I felt really vindictive, I'd drop it down to one star for serving beer (if you're lucky enough to get service) in fake (read: undersized) \"pint\" glasses. I detest that kind of nickle-and-diming. Next time I'm jonesing for a patio, I'll crack a beer and sit on my front steps before coming back here."}
{"text":"Stopped here on St. Pats day for corned beef and a beer or two. My sandwich was grilled marble rye, which was OK, but it was filled with some imitation of corned beef that a good restaurant should not feed customers, especially on this day. I would gladly pay more for a good corned beef like Sy Ginsberg's. Ruined my meal. I did receive good service from Justin and that might bring me back if I can get over that sandwich."}
{"text":"food is good.....average, casual restaurant, typical menu. something to please everybody.....building is very contemporary, rather neat......but NOISE VOLUME INSIDE IS HORRIBLE!!!  it gets SO loud, the 4 of us spent our entire dinner shouting at each other in order to converse. don't know if i'd go back, but i would bring earplugs next time!  parking sucks.........the lot is tiny and only offers valet parking, i don't like anybody else driving my car, apparently a lot of others felt the same way, as many cars were parked down side streets........"}
{"text":"I've heard some good things about their restaurant and decided to come check out a Sunday brunch. Brunch drinks and atmosphere were great, but the food and service could have been better. With summer right around the corner, this is going to be a great spot to check out due to their patio and Bloody Mary bar.   Very busy! Pulled up to find out they had a valet for Sunday brunch. I'm weird about that so I parked on a side street with all the other peasants who didn't mind walking a block or so to the restaurant.  They recommend reservations (which we didn't have), but we didn't have trouble getting a table for two out on the patio. If you have more than a table of 4, I'd strongly recommend a reservation.   Once at our seats, it took an unreasonably long time for a server to come to us, and then equally as long to come back with our drinks. Drinks were good though. We tried one of their mimosas and also their Bloody Mary bar cart which is swarming with options to put in your drink. Mimosa was boozy with just a hint of whatever fruit you pick (just the way a drink should be). I wanted to try another flavor but wasn't willing to risk the wait time.   Surprisingly, the food came really quickly. Nothing on the menu really enticed me too much, so I tried something that was an abnormal breakfast item and got the stuffed French toast that had peanut butter inside. It was good but chewy as you can expect from all the PB. The entree size was small so luckily I had ordered a side of home fries. They weren't really crisp and just tasted dry.  I had to lather them in ketchup to put them down.    I must give the manager kudos for being super nice in his interactions with the customers. Two separate groups had complaints that they had the manager come over for: one for not being seated near enough to their reservation time; one for a problem with their food. I think it says something that I saw two groups complain in the 1.5 hours I was here. I'd like to come back to check out their happy hour and beer selection though. Saw a sign indicating they had a new happy hour coming April 10th so I'll update once I visit!"}
{"text":"Went today for Sunday brunch. Had been a couple times (a year or so ago) and enjoyed it. Today was horrible. Our waitress seemed completely bothered to be there. Didn't check in with us at all after food came out. Service was so slow and the food was not good. Warm at best, steak over cooked, pancakes rubbery. Waitress again seemed uninterested. The manager did come over as we were walking out and gave a gift card. Doubt I will be back to use it. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in rocky river. The food is amazing! I highly recommend the mozzarella bites paired with the best marinara I've ever had."}
{"text":"I honestly have gone to the market since it opened and are used to swear by this place but the last two times that I have gone over the last couple months have been nothing but disappointment. I really hate saying that because it's amazing location with an amazing staff but the food has been subpar compared to where it used to be. For example we ordered muscles and they came out cold. I ordered a mushroom sandwich and all that was on it we're fried mushrooms on top of a piece of bread. Like I said this is been an amazing place since it was opened and unfortunately the last year The food has been terrible. However if you want to great drink with an amazing staff and a great location but I suggest this but just don't expect food that you will be talking about in the future"}
{"text":"Love this place!! I have been here several times and I'm sure will continue to visit it. Some of the bartenders are pretty ditzy, but they're not too bad. On Thursdays they have taco nights---soooo good. I love the beef ones, they have so much flavor; chicken ones are pretty good too. This restaurant uses local ingredients as much as they can---they get a lot of them from the West Side Market, which I think is awesome (support your local business owners!)  Some of their appetizers are half off for happy hour. The Boursin Bites are my favorite. They used to have pita nachos which were taken off the menu the last time I checked, but I hope they bring those back!! I also had a cup of their chicken paprikash soup---I also loved that! It's not as spicy as my mom's, but it's still good. I have seen other people order their salads, and they look really good--that's next on my list to get! I have also had their regular market burger, which it pretty good as well. Nothing fancy about it, but it's something I like to get when I go here.  They also have 1/2 bottle of wine nights--great deal if you're going to be splitting a bottle with anyone. The have an awesome bloody mary cart that a lot of people love (I'm not a bloody mary fan). This place gets busy on Friday nights at the bar, so if you're not getting a table, ge there earlier in the night! Their patio is great for when they weather is cooperating.  Market really won me over when one October they set up a tent over the parking lot and Pat Daily played. Our waitress was so fantastic and we had a great time. I really hope they do it again sometime soon. And thankfully they had heaters in the tent to keep us all warm!"}
{"text":"Very much off the beaten path, tucked between Lake and Detroit in Rocky River. We visited on Mother's Day evening and I was surprised by how un-busy the place was. It's a nicely-appointed, beautiful restaurant with lots of seating. Small-ish parking lot, though.   Friendly bartenders, a good variety of beers on tap, interesting cocktails, and a decent burger. The boyfriend ordered the French dip, which is made with filet, and it was kind of amazing. Their brunch looks interesting; they offer one of those ubiquitous Bloody Mary bars, if that's your thing.  Looks like their patio is quite nice too!"}
{"text":"Very very limited menu in my opinion, I was going in expecting something extensive and it was shorter than I'd heard about. There are TV's everywhere, you cannot escape them at all.  The food was eh, I have had better at places like Sweet Melissa or the Beachcliff Tavern. The atmosphere in the place is very Cheesecake Factory like but with the feel of a sports bar I'd say if you want that kind of experience, go to Fatheads or one of the chains, it would be a whole lot cheaper for the quality you receive. The one positive were the staff, very kind and accommodating, that's always a plus, also the free valet was nice since it was pouring when we arrived and left.  Over all it's an ok place if you are with people who like it, because it's more about the company, right?  Would I return anytime soon, probably not unless, as I said, I were with a group.  Over all it's an ok place"}
{"text":"Made a reservation on the \"Cancellation\" list. Got a call back 2 days later to confirm the time, which was said to be at first 12pm, Mother's Day! Then she changed her mind and said 10:00am. 10 is better anyway! Received a call back after the confirmation to be told I had till 12 so that another party would be able to sit in the same table! RUDE AS HELL! It's Mother's Day, I refuse to rush my mother! Got there ON TIME, NOT one person was seated and there was a line. Yes, it went FAST, but we were seated with 3 people on a TWO top! Ridiculous! Especially the entire 2 hours of being there, there were several empty tables with NO WAIT! Absolutely ridiculous! My mother's food came out and just the looks of the selection she made was bad. She took a bit and it was not good, at all! Yes, they ordered another selection and comp'ed it from the bill, but the feeling of being rushed to be out by noon was very discouraging! I will be sure to not make a reservation for ANY holiday if this will be the way it will be. By the way, second option was great, but a bit of a let down when it is for your mom on her special day!"}
{"text":"I was served a delicious Bloody Mary, the food was nothing to be overly excited about but the WAITER that served our table was so unprofessional and rude. BOB MILLER should definatley find a job that he enjoys. One could never be good a something they hate! Would NEVER enter this resturant again for this reason. Being in the customer service industry myself I would certainly not expect a return visit from my clients having been treated in such a class-less fashion. As a owner/manager I would certainly take care of my wait staff choice.  With this type of behavior that was shown by Mr. Miller  certainly would not be my choice of  a wait staff for a successful resturant. I have shared with all of my clients the RUDE service that was shown to my guests and myself at our visit to the MARKET. One unhappy cusotmer can do more harm then 10 happy . With such a great choice of other resturants in the area WHY would one visit here??"}
{"text":"Oh Market, you could be so much more awesome. The service has always been fantastic. Every time I've been there, we've been promptly greeted and sat, even once on a saturday night. The waiters and waitresses were timely and friendly and could handle the rowdy groups that I always seem to be with. Interior itself is beautiful. I really like the enclosed patio. And the wine and beer lists were great!  Saving the worst for last, I really didn't like the food. I had a seared ahi wrap and the ingredients never stated wasabi peas, those suckers  can break a tooth! And my aunt's broccoli cheddar soup was way too salty. If I go back, I'm just gonna drink."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and keep trying to make excuses to go back! The Bloody Mary cart is where its at! They bring you a glass with vodka in it and you go to the cart to customize the rest yourself. They cart is stocked with dozens of hot sauces, different types of stuffed olives and peppers, and even smokies  right from the West Side Market. Top it off with some crunchy celery or carrots and a strip of bacon and you're in Bloody Mary heaven.  I've tried the salmon eggs Benedict and the California omelet, both were great and the ingredients tasted fresh! I want to come back to tackle the rest of the menu items!  My next vendetta, trying the mimosa sampler!"}
{"text":"Third time is a charm for never coming back to this place: 1st:  Sat for 10 minutes without a server even making their way toward our table for drinks.  We left and told the hostess what happened to the result of a blank stare. 2nd: Ate breakfast and they messed up my girlfriends order twice.  First was the wrong entree so I awkwardly ate my breakfast while she watched.  Second they gave her the wrong side.  She ate it but still we didn't have time to send it back so got the f out of there disappointed. 3rd:  Came in for a drink after Wine Bar (much better choice).  Apparently there's a table next to the kitchen for \"staff only\" that isn't marked so we sat there unknowingly for a drink.  I've never been laughed at by a group of servers before - then they stared at us every time they made a run past the table, expecting us to leave?  Totally awkward.  Bottom line:  Go to Wine Bar or Tommy's, much better environment without the entitled employees."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour.  Very nice space--open with an Old World provenance.  Good selection of craft beers and only $3 for draft.  Happy hour appitizers ranged for OK to very good.  Would come back again."}
{"text":"The presentation of this omelet was flawless. (See the attached picture.) One of the most flavorless veggie omelet I've ever experienced.  I'd give The Market 0 stars if that were a selection.  The service was so slow that I think they were waiting on the hen to lay the eggs. Not to mention the server told me when I asked for flavored creamer that she \"apologizes for not meeting my standards.\" I would recommend any other breakfast place before The Market."}
{"text":"Really great food and a cool atmosphere.  We had the cheese curds (best ever dipping sauce) and I ordered the southwest chicken salad which was hands down one of the best salads I've ever had.  Our service was great, our waiter Chad was very knowledgeable on wine and menu selections and wasn't annoyed that we sat and chatted well after we paid our bill.  Definitely want to go back and check out their brunch!"}
{"text":"Just had the most amazing lunch at The Market! The Lunch Trio is a great deal! Our waiter Justin was unbelievable!  Our water glasses were always filled, he catered to our little one, and had great menu suggestions! A favorite, convenient, scrumptious spot. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch one afternoon and the food just wasn't that great. It was hot when it came out but hardly had any flavor. Waitress was slow and not very attentive. I will say that the best time to come is for brunch. Outstanding brunch food."}
{"text":"Great space.. I really like the feel of this bar and the building itself. Very comfortable. Even being that it is so new. High ceilings and a wide heavy large oval bar. The service is also quite good, they are friendly and on top of it.   I have been for brunch twice here now and I am blown away by their extensive \"build your own Bloody Mary Bar!\" It have a wide variety of dried meats, olives, pickles, mixes, and more. By far the biggest one I've ever seen. AWESOME!  Brunch ends at 3.   The food is good, although VERY pricey. Over priced, really. The brunch stuff is consistent. We also have the perogie appetizer this time and it was out of this world! The burger was nothing special, actually below average for places in Cleveland.  Mixed crowd. I get the feeling this may be the bar of choice for the middle aged weekender set of River.   Great beer selection also, lots of taps! BIG TVs line the middle of the bar."}
{"text":"Adore this place. There is nothing better than stopping in here after work and grabbing a nice chilled glass of white wine. The decor inside is amazing, super rustic and just charming. They tables for everyone, and booths for all parties. They also have a private room which I believe you can reserve for a big party. Their bar houses many big flat screen TVs which make this place ideal for game nights.   Now lets talk about the patio, it is so cute and perfect positioned that it gets sun light all day long. Their food is so good! The pretzel pickle chips are to die for and if they ever have the chicken and chorizo soup, you should totally get it.   Highly recommend this place for lunch, brunch, dinner or late night drinks. Beware of parking at the place, it's pretty tight so you might have to park across the street but the walk is totally worth it."}
{"text":"I used to love this place! I love the patio and have enjoyed the food in the past. So super disappointed by our visit today.  Our server was nice, ambience was nice but the food was pretty terrible (save the wings appetizer).   So we had wings for an appetizer. Pretty standard fare but enjoyable. Just how wings should be- nicely cooked and good ratio of sauce.   The entrees were just terrible. We had the market burger and the fried chicken sandwich.   The burger had no flavor, and it was burnt on the outside. It left a bad taste in my mouth. We split it and my hubby was spying his in BBQ sauce to make palatable.  The chicken sandwich was a total bummer-seriously no flavor. There was a yogurt sauce but it just tasted like yogurt, not really a sauce.   We made it through the meal with sides of BBQ and pickles... not a good sign. I would have rather had Wendy's.   I am hopeful that maybe this was just a fluke. But at almost $50 with tax and tip for lunch, I don't know if I will return to try it."}
{"text":"The food deserves 3-4 stars, and the drinks probably 4, but the abysmal parking and service situation drags down the overall experience.  Don't park outside their lot, you *will* get towed. If there isn't a space within a few minutes, go find somewhere else to eat. Simple as that.  Cheese curds were great, the featured cocktails as advertised. Nashville hot chicken biscuits fell apart and had to be eaten with a fork (and the biscuit discarded)."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely stunning and amazing!! As soon as you walked in you felt like you were just at home. The staff were very polite and and service was on point! The quality of the food was absolutely incredible. I especially liked that there is an outside and inside seating area."}
{"text":"Last Monday night was my third time venturing out to Market which is located on the restaurant happy Linda Street in Rocky River. It was a pretty night and we were celebrating my mother's birthday and I'm sure glad we did. Market has a clean, contemporary look on the outside with a beautiful patio for the warm months of the year with plenty of seating. The charm on the inside of the restaurant comes with a rustic look and very nice and clean bar. We opted to eat outside for our meal and were seated immediately (we did have a reservation but didn't need it). Market is known for upscale bar food and also finer cuisine and also for their Blood Mary drinks.   We were waiting for my girlfriend to show up since she was getting let out late from work so we opted for drinks and an appetizer. I ordered my standard Moscow Mule which was delicious and my dad got a Bell's Oberon on draft (one of my favorite summer beers). The beer list is impressive as is the Bloody Mary's they serve (which include a stuffed pepper garnish, pretty cool!). I don't really care for tomato juice so Bloody Mary's aren't my usual jam but this one was definitely good (I wouldn't drink a whole one, too spicy for me but I understand why people enjoy them). I can't even describe how good the bacon cheddar tots were, literally I want to eat them all day.   My girlfriend showed up shortly after (she ordered a nice glass of Moscato) and we took our dinner orders. We both got the blackened chicken pita sandwich with fries. Warm pita, delicious boneless chicken breast, melted cheese, crispy bacon, lettuce, sans tomato (for me), onion and guacamole made for a delicious entrée (simple but perfect). The sea salt fries were a great side as well. My parents both went with the pretzel crusted salmon over cheddar mash and green beans. They both very much enjoyed their dinners as well.   Market is just one of those spots that are consistent with their food, drinks and service. Our server was exactly the type of server I want at any type of restaurant. She was polite, got refills quickly, remembered our order and asked us how our food was AFTER we had a few bites. I also had a gentleman waiter on a previous trip and he was great from my memory. I would definitely recommend one of my favorite spots to anyone if you are on the West Side. Market is fantastic."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill the past few years. Nothing impressive. Mediocre food. Great happy hour if you just want to come for appetizers! But not much of an entree menu."}
{"text":"I'd been here several times for a drink on the patio or by the fireplace and enjoyed it.  Had a lunch salad once and it was good.  But 4 of us ate there for dinner December 30 and nobody liked their meal- very disappointed.  I won't go for dinner again.  The spinach quesadillas were quite bad and my date's sliders were blah.  Too expensive for that kind of quality."}
{"text":"Great patio, great atmosphere however I think the food is just ok and it's way overpriced"}
{"text":"Brunch was excellent! We walked in as a party of six at about 11am on a Sunday during Labor Day weekend and the place was just starting to get cranking. We sat outside but under the sheltered portion. The coffee was decent (no espresso though) and I ordered the market breakfast with bacon as recommended by the waitress. My scrambled eggs were light, the bacon was cooked to perfection, the english muffins were buttered (a bit too much from what I normally use but I ate them anyways cause it's buttered!) but the hash browns are what stood out. Crispy and thin but not enough to make it into potato chip form and seasoned with all the right spices. Even after finishing my meal I still wanted more hash browns! You won't be disappointed if you order them. The other folks at the table gave nods to the french toast, omelets and fritata. The price is right too."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday nite with a reservation for 7 people. The place was not very crowded. The server was new, the menu new and the chef new, which proved to be a disaster. Waited for the food for more than an hour. Service was terrible, not sure if it was because the server was new or because there were not enough of them but she did not stop at the table nearly enough for drinks during the long wait, and then it took a very long time to get the drinks from the bar. Lots of apologies were offered and the server said they had been experiencing problems and had meetings about them pertaining to stuff like this happening. When the food came it was cold and some meals were cold and over cooked, parts of entrees were missing, bad presentation, something that said it was grilled was not grilled...overall with the long wait and the quality of the meal it was a big miss. The manager came over and took half of everyones check which was the right thing to do. Was a regular of this place in the past, but with the number of good restaurants anymore probably won be back."}
{"text":"Our local Cincinnati alumni group has had several basketball game watch parties here over the past year.  Food was good and they worked with us on a few specials for bigger games.  Everyone was pleased didn't hear any complaints."}
{"text":"Had lunch...well, I guess brunch this past Sunday. I've always been a little on the fence about Market, even though I really enjoy the restaurant group's other places. This experience left me with the same feeling. Bar service was slow, a problem compounded by the waitress bringing the wrong drink. It was just a mimosa, I don't even remember what flavor, so I drank it anyway (just get a normal one, the juices for the others tasted very artificial).  The food was decent, I had chicken and waffles, but they came with very little gravy on them. I asked for more, which took a while to come and I was charged kind of a lot of $ for, even though no one mentioned it at the time. I can't really blame the waitress for not being able to give us attention since they dropped an 8 and 12 top on her at more or less the same time, full of confused old people and Brown's fans with infants. Still though, a little more service would have been nice.   So I guess in summation, nothing was terribly wrong and we didn't leave upset in any way, but in general the experience nor food just didn't leave an impression, which is how I've always really felt whenever I've been there. Oh, the forced \"complimentary\" valet service with the parking lot blocked off though...that's not cool."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Market for the first time last night with another couple. They managed to fit us in without reservations, for which we were grateful! Let me begin by saying service was extremely slow. It took a while before we saw our waitress and when she took drink orders, it took a while to receive the drinks. (The bar must have been extremely busy!) The four of us shared an appetizer which was OK... nothing spectacular IMHO. My girlfriend and I each ordered the Savannah Seafood Roll and the husbands each ordered General Tao's Noodle Bowl. When the meals came, the husbands got their noodle bowls but we did not get our seafood rolls... they brought us the Ahi tuna burgers instead. Our waitress was not the one bringing the food and therefore to alert somebody that the order was wrong, took a bit of time. We had to flag her down! My girlfriend already started eating her tuna because she couldn't decide between that and the seafood roll anyways. I did not order the tuna and I wanted what I ordered. The waitress assured me that what I ordered is what was placed in front of me. I had to actually get a menu and show her the difference between the two. She really wanted me to eat the tuna burger and asked me if that wouldn't be OK. I told her no... That wasn't what I ordered. Graciously, she did eventually bring me my sandwich but I was eating by myself by that time. Note: The fries that accompanied our meals were on the greasy side. The fries that accompanied my girlfriends burger, must have come from the bottom of the basket... Dark, crispy, greasy, and no more than an inch in length. Essentially, they were pieces parts. After asking twice, she did get new fries after she was done with her burger... so I guess that was a plus! I can honestly say that the food was good but not  worth the price nor the aggravation."}
{"text":"I was impressed right away by Market's building. Everything inside and out was stunning. A lovely patio, spacious indoors with high ceilings and detailed décor everywhere. The staff was really friendly and we had a great waiter.  My bloody mary was a little too spicy, which is something I never thought I'd say. My burger was good, enough that I'd eat it again. However, I feel that their prices are a little high."}
{"text":"It is not fair that due to location this place doesnt have to put any effort into food or service. We waited so long for food and drinks we had to ask for boxes upon receiving our meals. Service was so slow only to get terrible overpriced dishes. We had to ask multiple times to receive one drink order. I wish I could say I wouldn't be back but its a very central location making the experience forced tolerable."}
{"text":"Starts and ends with Bloody Mary Bar for Sunday Brunch.  That's my most likely time to make a Market appearance because it's just so good.  The atmosphere is top notch.  The decor, the crowd, the feel.  And the service is strong.  The dinner is also good.  The after dinner snack (read after alcohol snack) is the fried macaroni bites.  Oh my god the macaroni bites.  I have no idea how it was so good.  My mouth literally couldn't communicate to my brain how good it was.  I didn't even want to eat it, I wanted to frame it.  But then I ate it.  All of it.  If I was gluttonous, I'd order even more."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Our waitress wove us through a pretty empty restaurant to the back corner next to the freezing garage door of windows.  The happy hour on wine is great, half off all the \"by the glasses\".  We wanted to get the fried pickles but they were out. Who runs out of pickles?  Several of the apps I wanted to try were not one of happy hour pricing. We went with the cheese curds which were little discs of fried cheese. They were good but not $12 good if it hadn't been happy hour.  My burger was like a hockey puck and the cheese was molded onto it.  It just wasn't good for the price."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as I've heard good things from many friends who have been here.  I'd been about a year before but only had drinks at the bar.  Apparently, that's where I should have stayed.  My husband and I came on a Friday before Christmas and immediately got seated after dropping our car off at the complimentary/mandatory valet (nice touch but I'd rather park myself-especially when there are visibly spots available).  There were a ton of open tables in the main dining room and other side rooms but the hostess sat us against some drafty windows along the seasonal patio.  It's December in Cleveland, I was freezing and had to wear my scarf through dinner because apparently all the empty tables were \"reserved\".  In the three and a half hours we were there (met friends at the bar after our meals) those tables remained empty.    Due to our chilly location, I order chicken paprikosh soup and it was fantastic.  I wish it came as an entree because that would have been perfect.  Instead, I had the tuna wrap after the server recommended it as his favorite thing on the menu.  It was alright at best.  I think it's better suited for a summer lunch as it didn't take the chill off me or my hunger.  My husband had the strip steak and was less than pleased.  The strip steak was cooked to order, but was not flavorful or juicy; it was definitely not worth the price.  The beer options were decent, although they were out of my first choice.  I don't feel a strong urge to go back to Market but I wouldn't rule it out as a place to meet friends if they were insistent.   If there's a \"next time\" I'll stick with soup and beer."}
{"text":"I want to like Market because of the location, patio, and beer selection, but my experience is always just okay. The service is prompt and the space is great, but the food is where I think Market is lacking.   On my last visit, I had some pieces of the truffle mac and cheese sticks, which were delicious to start with, but after the third bite I could feel all the greasy breadcrumbs pooling into a puddle in my stomach. My sandwich was less impressive; it was a turkey/pepperoni sandwich with roasted red pepper mayo, which sounded delicious. However, the honey turkey/spicy pepperoni combo on ice cold bread just didn't do it for me. I feel the quality of their food has been slipping. Cold bread on a warm sandwich? Unacceptable.  I do have to say that their chicken paprikash soup is OUT OF THIS WORLD. I think that's always my motivation to go back to Market, but the rest of the food just isn't cutting it."}
{"text":"This place is pretty big. The outside is neat. There are seats partly under cover but still outside and seats completely in the sun. At night there is a fire put that gets turned on often. I've been for lunch and dinner. At dinner the other night I was surprised the parking lot was closed even though many spots remained and a valet was present. It was a free service but not really necessary - at least not at the time I went. Nice friendly servers and a good on tap beer menu. Food isn't bad at all - the butter poached salmon was good. As for the rest of the menu it's not totally all bar food which is a plus."}
{"text":"Food is always average and I think slightly overpriced. The appetizers we had were decent, but the mushrooms were such a range of sizes that it made it difficult to share. The goat cheese \"bruschetta\" was delicious, but needed more bread served with it. I had the Korean BBQ beef bowl and wouldn't order again. The server said if you like spice, get it. Well, I love spice and this had nothing in it remotely spicy. More sweet and tangy rice was sticking in clumps, very few pieces of pineapple or beef, basically just a giant bowl of rice.  This dish definitely was overpriced and  it underperformed.   I prefer brunch from here. For people complaining about parking, they always offer free valet."}
{"text":"Had a great meal there with a large group (two families).   In particular we had food allergies and the staff was super attentive and explicit how they prepared things and giving us options.   Food was good we had happy kids and adults.   Free valet parking was nice on a cold and snowy night!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight, 5/4/18 and found a new menu and was not overly impressed. Had some mozzarella cheese bites to start and they were fine but covered in a pesto that over powered the dish. Had a Korean bbq bowl for dinner, menu stated shredded beef however my bowl had slightly over cooked chunks of steak. Flavor was ok. Overall I would say just some fairly major issues with the execution of the menu items. Service was average at best. Atmosphere was fine."}
{"text":"You MUST get the espresso creme brûlée!  I drank my cucumber mule in 5 minutes on accident because it was so delicious. My pear mule was also quite good (I'm a huge mule fan, so the fact that they have at least 3 mule type drinks is a huge plus).   Our chipotle bbq wings were perfectly crispy and saucy.   Their charcuterie platter wasn't very well put together - didn't have the variety needed to make different concoctions - we were left with nothing but a ton of meat - everything else was gone.  Their menu looked amazing. It doesn't burden you with choices, but I still couldn't decide. I wanted everything. I have to return to try entrees like chicken-sausage roulade and pork loin over pumpkin risotto.  The warm atmosphere & industrial decor is awesome.   Bar service wasn't very good TBH, but they were friendly at least.  All in all, a great experience (so long as you're willing to wait for drinks)."}
{"text":"Recently met some friends for drinks during Market's happy hour.   The service was decent and the food was pretty good. We split some sliders and arancini, both were worth the price of admission. But the drinks?   We all ordered cocktails during the happy hour. Mine were $6 each and completely watered down, and so were everyone else's libations. Frankly, I don't care if it's happy hour. If you don't want to put as much alcohol in your drinks then don't put it in a big glass filled with mostly tonic and call it a cocktail. I really dislike when an establishment is dishonest like this, it makes me wonder what else goes on behind closed doors.   If you go, be sure to double-check when you get your tab. They charged me for an extra drink I never ordered."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place positive reviews.  I have only negative things to say about the service.  I took a colleague here for drinks, it took 20 minutes to order each round and we watched as the wait staff talked to one another.  Another time I brought a friend here we sat down and the snarky waiter made some very unfunny jokes.  It almost seems like every time I go here you are a burden.  I've complained to the manager several times and nothing has been done to improve the attentiveness or friendliness of the staff.  It's really too bad.  I want to like this place, but the service is just terrible for the prices they charge."}
{"text":"Love me some Market! Great food in a cozy, hip atmosphere! They have a really nice bar and patio with a delectable draught beer selection.  It's a great place to catch the game since there's plenty of TVs everywhere!  I came here once for a late dinner and another time for brunch and the to watch the Browns game.  For dinner, I had the MKT Mac & Cheese and shared a few appetizers with a buddy. The Bahn Mi sliders were decent, with good flavor and plenty of meat and pickled veggies, but I was disappointed with the baguette not being warm and toasted.  That would've made a huge difference. The Summer Rolls were surprisingly good and the wasabi soy dipping sauce added some kick and cleared my sinuses.  The dinner menu is a tad bit pricey though.  Sunday brunch at Market was fantastic!  I started with some sweet potato tots, which were sweet and crisp and paired nicely with the side of sweet chili sauce.  The sauce may have been a little too sweet for my tastes though.  The MKT Griddle I had for my entree was cooked to perfection!  Two or three griddle cakes with two poached eggs atop, covered with a creamy hollandaise sauce and a healthy side of scalloped potato home fries...'Twas fantastic and very filling!  I did notice that they offer a nice Bloody Mary barb during brunch, but I didn't partake. Next time for sure!  Food coma had set in and the Browns beat the Ravens that day, so it was all in all a great afternoon in the RR.  I'm hearing great things about their happy hour specials on beer, wine, and apps (half off?) from fellow Yelper Cara L, so I'll be checking that out in the near future."}
{"text":"According to our server a new general manager was installed a few months ago. Maybe that explains the down trend in food quality, speed of service and are you kidding me ? running out of ketchup. Been going here for a number of years and the food was always surprisingly good, reasonably priced and the service used to be fast and friendly. Under the new GM the menu was totally redone, missing some old favorites. Could live with that but now the food is very average, more expensive and the kitchen painfully slow. Twenty-five minute wait for a basic sandwich and my wife's also basic no special requests entree. Server was friendly and efficient but mediocre food, high prices, slow service and running out of basic condiments means we probably won't be back anytime soon. Too bad, this place had a lot of things going for it and it was close by."}
{"text":"The goat cheese bruschetta was amazing!  The tuna spring rolls had a light filling, nice and fresh, but the oil was a little heavy on the fried outside like an egg roll rather than a spring roll.  I would love to have this wrapped in clear rice paper mmmm"}
