{"text":"Went at 4:00 on a Friday afternoon. We had two little girls with us and the bartender was great, got them lemonade and cookies and popcorn.  I had a great ale, while my compadres had a flight of red wine and a flight of white wine. Prices are ok, with a special of buy a flight get a flight for half off. $22 for a flight with some pretty tasty wine from Macedonia (although not all were great). Excellent atmosphere and a good crowd. Even thought the prices are a bit high compared to other happy hours we will go back.  This would be a great place for later in the evening.  Just beer and wine and a very limited food menu."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, and both times it was great.

Very friendly staff, and great wine selection. They do tastings every Thursday, and even though it was packed, we got great service. 

It's located behind Clever Koi, right off Central, parking in the back. FYI, they don't have much in the way of food. Which is OK, good place to get drinks before Clever Koi!"}
{"text":"Best place to sit and have an amazing glass of wine! Great decor and environment. People working were friendly, knowledgable and had fun conversation. Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Central Wine for the first time.  WE LOVED IT!!  Not only was the decor fabulous and tastefully done they have some of the best wine in Phoenix.  We opted for the three glass tasting.  The wines were all wonderful and different from any we had ever had.  We have been to Napa and Sonoma many times and yet Central Wine's selections were fresh and we throughly enjoyed our selections.  We also chose the cheese & meat board which came with fresh bread, jam, nuts, 3 meats and 3 cheeses.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere. Very tastefully decorated with bling and chandeliers without being gaudy. It's a small space with a large marble wine bar and tall, cushy bar chairs and just a few small seating areas for small groups. There is an open wine cellar and it appears you can select any wine and they will open it for you. There is a $5 corking fee. 
The wine list is small, in keeping with the general theme. Same with appetizers, very short list. Popcorn and cheeseboard. That's about it. 
So the only thing that is not small is the price for a glass of wine.  Mine was $15!! For a single glass?!!! Ouch!! Perhaps I'm just ghetto with my $3-Buck-Chuck or 40 Lb Rooster...that $15 was tough to swallow. 
I won't lie, the wine was delicious. Just a little too pricey for me. Hence, 3 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and service. Jenna, the owner, is so fun to be around. My friends and I will definitely be back for wine tasting!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a wine lover. I am always on the lookout for new interesting wines and places to get wine. I especially like finding good value wine. Central Wine fits the bill, they have a lot of  unique wines that are also affordable. My wife and I went in for a couple of glasses last Sat. night and really liked the layout and bar. I am seriously considering joining their wine club as well. good place with different good wines at decent prices. will be back soon."}
{"text":"Really a fun place to be. The wine bar has a great atmosphere, fab decor, and delicious wine to boot. This neighborhood needed a chill place like this to hang out for a nice glass of wine, and I'm glad they opened up. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service and ambiance. Perfect place for a date or girls night. The server and owner were both very welcoming, friendly, and knowledgable. Definitely will be back to enjoy more of their recommendations."}
{"text":"Downtown Phoenix has needed a wine bar like this! Central Wine is a legitimate wine bar, little to no good available. However, they have a great selection of wine!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!! Just go... You won't be disappointed!  The staff is as good as the wine.  Super friendly and a great night out every time."}
{"text":"Excellent wine selection and exceptional service. This place is a must for all wine lovers."}
{"text":"Cute spot, good place for a date night or hanging with friends. Also a nice selection of wines"}
{"text":"Do you think wine bars are sometimes stuffy and the staff a bit pretentious? Not the case at Central Wine. This charming and inviting wine bar in uptown Phoenix appeals to both the wine enthusiast and novice. No longer will you need to snap a picture of that bottle of wine you just fell in love with knowing you'll forget the name by morning. Now you can take it home with you! Well done Central Wine! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Central Wine Bar is cute and inviting inside. There is a small area of wines by the bottle to purchase, and a corking fee to enjoy one of those in the bar. There is a small menu of wines by the glass (maybe 6 to 8 of each red and white), a couple of beers, and a cheese/meat/fruit plate. Wines range from $7 to $11 per glass. A few of each the red and white were on tap and could be tasted before ordering. The cheese plate is $15. 

I tried two reds, both on tap: a Syrah and a Pinot Noir. One was $8 and the other $9. Both were fine. They provide free bar snacks which included popcorn and almonds. 

Overall I liked the atmosphere and the wine was fine. However, without any happy hour specials on price per glass, I'm not sure I would go back at that time of day when other nearby places are offering equally good, if not better, wine with a greater selection at better prices ($5 glasses before 5 at Postino about 2 miles up Central).  There are specials- wine tastings. I'm just not sure Central Wine Bar can compete without a happy hour special to bring people through the door."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are not huge wine drinkers so we came looking for some guidance towards a good wine for our wedding and were not disappointed. We were able to tell Jenna what little we knew about what we wanted and she was able to direct us towards some great options. Not only did we purchase 3 bottles of wine but we stayed for a few glasses as well. We were hungry (for more than the cheese boards they have) but she had a menu for the food place next door and told us we could order takeout and eat it at the bar so we didn't have to chug our wine. It was the best of both worlds and we had a great night"}
{"text":"Hmmmmmmm. Hmmmmmmm. Hmmmmm. This is literally what you will be thinking when you leave this place. The wine, amazing! The ambiance, alluring. The service, abysmal. A little snobbish for our liking. Still debating whether to come back or not."}
{"text":"Great wine bar with a relaxed hip setting.  Service is top notch and personable.   They offer a variety of wines that you can't find in the markets and chain stores.  Wine flights and snack boards are great value and interesting.
I signed up for their mailing list to keep up to date with current happenings.  They often have unique wine classes with tastings on some Saturdays with featured wine makers or wines of a region.   Will make this a regular go-to visit."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!!!! A friend recommended it to me. After a few trips to Napa and Temecula, I'm starting to learn about wine. The staff is very helpful in helping to guide your decision on which wine to pick. The prices are reasonable for the quality of the wine. My favorite parts are the wine tastings on Thursday and the flights. I have brought several friends back wand they agree that the place is the bee's knees. Very cute inside and the owner is often working. I like to support local business and this is a great one!"}
{"text":"I come here every once in a while, especially, if I'm eating at the nearby restaurants. They have such amazing decor inside! They also have a wonderful wine selection and you can even purchase wine bottles from here to take home. They don't have much for food options, but the main concept here is the wine so if your okay with a few small plates of popcorn, bread, and cheese then you'll be okay. I love stopping here for a night cap. It's not very big, so I don't recommend for larger groups. Friendly staff who are knowledgeable of wines. I definitely recommend stopping by for a nice glass of wine here!"}
{"text":"The ambience and decor is so amazing. This place is everything. We ordered a tapas platter and sampled about three wines. They were all delicious."}
{"text":"Great spot to relax and have a glass (or bottle) after work. Able to enjoy the cozy atmosphere, which is rare in central Phoenix. And the wines are fantastic. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Came here after dinner at koi and it was awesome and had such a good time here. The service was great and the place is beautiful and of course the wine was on pointtttt.we had a red wine flight and we picked one wine and our bartender picked the other two and she did a hell of a job. Definitely will make it a point to come here again."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The atmosphere is perfect, the decor is beautiful, and it wasn't overly noisy for a Friday night.  The staff was knowledgeable and friendly and the cheese plate we got was delicious."}
{"text":"The best place along the light rail in Phoenix to grab a glass of wine and unwind. Central Wine Bar provides a well curated wine selection in a relaxing, social atmosphere. The employees are incredibly helpful to those who don't know much about wine (other than the fact that they like to drink it.) It's not too loud and is perfect for conversation. It's a must stop for anyone in the central Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The cutest place! The atmosphere and interior decor are one-of-kind. The live music was amazing. The wine-tenders know what's up and are SO fun!! Great place to hang out and catch up with friends. Not overly crowded or loud; I could easily have a conversation with my friends at the bar. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very cool & hip wine bar with wonderful wines & great service. Great music & decor. I would like to see more varieties & choices in wine & beer but this is a must try wine bar.  Fabulous addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT well educated staff, delicious wine and great snacks. I had a great time here visiting from Cali :-)"}
{"text":"THIS place was simply amazing. From the relaxing and quiet atmosphere, to Adele playing in the background, super kind service, and tasty wine -- we were very impressed. And don't even get me started on the cheese and bread boards!! Soooo good. Central Wine Bar is great for all occasions, but an excellent spot for a couple or friends to chill before heading home. Looking forward to our next visit. :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome Wine with Excellent Service. I consider myself a bit of a wine expert. After speaking with Jenna, the owner, I was  wowed by her wine selection. Not only does she carry different wines but she has a philosophy behind why each one fits her menu the best. I would highly recommend anyone who wants to have a relaxing time or possibly have a date night to check out this spot!"}
{"text":"My girl friend and I walked over after having a bite to eat at clever koi and figured we'd just check it out real quick, grab a glass of wine. ... a glass of wine turned into a bottle for only $14.00 and we sat there laughing and chit chatting with almost all the girls in the room. Very chic and the ladies behind the bar are cute and spunky. I can definitely say I love love love this little place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and really enjoy this wine bar. It's a small bar with very comfortable lounge seating and has an ideal setup to catch up with friends. Both times I had their Thursday tastings which is a great deal at $15. Their staff is really friendly and knowledgable, when they serve the flights they will explain in detail the flavors and origin. They also have a great happy hour and delicious complimentary popcorn. This is a great place to go if you're looking for a relaxed night out."}
{"text":"Here is another one for the Tinder Daters out there. A perfect spot for your first meet up to impress your future girlfriend. On the other hand, a perfect night out for any couple who wants to enjoy some fancy wine and fancy cheese in a calm romantic atmosphere. 

My favorite thing about knowing about this place, is I can have it on the back burner as a get out of the dog house card when my girlfriend is upset with me."}
{"text":"Hate to rain on everybody's parade, but I was not impressed.  The place is cute, but I am not going to go out of my way to come here.  The selection of wines is pretty small for a wine bar.  I had the J Vineyards Brut Rose ($12).  I mentioned to the server/only employee of the place that I was at J Vineyards last year with a friend and tried their wines.  I was debating which one of the sparkling wines to order and I didn't get any response.  I am not sure if she was knowledgeable of the wines.  I also wanted to order the only item available, but I was ignored until she needed my menu to hand it to a guy at the other end of the bar.  I had the meat and cheese plate ($15).  It was ok, nothing to really write home about.  I have other choices closer to my house.  I might come back if friends set up a get together there, but I certainly won't go on my own."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fantastic location, friendly and great wine selection. Great place to \"wine\" down and relax.."}
{"text":"Super cute place on Central Avenue to pop in and enjoy a nice glass of wine.  The atmosphere and decor are perfect, the bartender was friendly and helpful and the rose champagne was just what I needed.  This place could become a habit!"}
{"text":"I am an absolute fiend for wine. I know, that admitting that openly could, well, render me one of 'those' labels.. But. So be it. Label away! When I find a great wine bar in the PHX/Scottsdale area, I have to talk about it! In this case, let me yell.. YELP  it from the rooftops! I had this on my bookmarks to try for several months. I finally got my chance. Upon entering, I swear I am ushered back to quaint Mendocino County where I grew up in Northern California wine country. It's chic; it's quaint and full of class.. it's decor is totally all of the above and so are the wines and light bite offerings. We were warmly greeted by the owner, I loved him as he reminded me of a friend/colleague of mine. He was interested in knowing our 'tastes'. He offered us small tastings just to get started and decide. He explained the wines and their region and grape varietal. I went with a sparkling rose. My husband a nice Pinot Noir. There is a good offering for all wine tastes from novice to connoisseur. The gratis munching popcorn snack, although I can't have , is a nice touch too! There are wine flights and a couple of swanky cocktails if you want to mix it up from the wine. The charcuterie plates are $15 and looked divine and ample! They sell by the bottle and there are also boxed gourmet chocolates you can pick up for a nice gift on the go ... or date! Central Wine had me at first POP goes the bubbly.. but more than that, it's a great date place ; a perfect pre-dinner place ; after dinner place for wine or dessert..or even an alone contemplative place. It's just pretty much perfect ! It's also not too big of a place and the music is low key and not loud or overwhelming. I can't wait to go taste more wine soon ! This time , I'm gonna try one of those charcuterie boards! 
Oh and PS! Happy Hour is 2-6pm! $2 off!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful little wine bar. It is really just that - a bar, a few comfortable chairs and small tables, and a lovely, well-selected menu of wines and beer. A few little menu nibbles. A very polished decor. All of the staff is knowledgeable and helpful, and the owner is very involved and passionate about wine. A great place to have a pre- or post-dinner drink, and they have regular wine flights with various themes (sparkling wines, French varietals, etc.)."}
{"text":"Great wine and space! Awesome ownership. Highly recommend that you support and check out this locally owned business!"}
{"text":"Charming, classy place, wonderful service, small bites and Arizona wine (amongst others).  I looooved their music - I think from the 50's? It added to the character of the place. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. The atmosphere is awesome,  dimmed  lighting, great background music makes this place a great place to bring a date. Some of the wines you can only get her, the Amrita is fantastic."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic and could easily make it to my #1 spot if they started serving food. I received some wonderful recommendations by the bar staff! The ambiance is perfect for any small group whether friendly or romantic. 
The food option was a cheese plate which was approx $15. It was a good cheese plate however if I'm going to keep drinking I need to be able to eat. 
The only parking option was valet. It's not clearly marked that you need to valet so just go straight to valet. It's complimentary...nice!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to stop by this wine bar for a very long time.  I must say the gentlemen behind the bar needs some customer service lessons.  I was the only one at the bar. He took my order, gave me popcorn , and never once engaged me I any conversation.  I asked him about the merlot and some other various wines on the menu.  He only had one word answer or no comment at all. He basically kept going in the back.  I was there for 30 minutes and as I said there was no conversation to entice me to stay let alone order another glass.  I was the only person there. At the end I told him I was going to look at the retail wine bottles for sale.  He said ok if I had any questions to let him know.  This would have been a good time to ask me what I like and maybe make a recommendation. Nonetheless he said nothing and I left.  Not sure if I will go back even though the place is charming"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful ambiance! My good friend took me here and since then cannot stop raving about it! I even loved the glass ware! The lead bartender was attentive and easy to talk to. The wine was delicious and the couches  were comfy:) I definitely recommend going with just a couple friends or reserving it out for larger parties. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in for a glass (...or bottle) of wine on Tuesday night! We initially stopped in at Postino's but the wait was an hour and a half - no thank you! We decided to try out this place on a whim and I'm so glad we did! We had a great time. The bartender (I believe his name was Stuart) was so friendly and knowledgable of all of the great wines they had to offer. We also got the meat and cheese plate which was a great snack! This place is truly a hidden gem. I can't wait to go back for wine tasting on Thursdays!"}
{"text":"Central wine is a sweet, chic and intimate wine bar that is something special. The staff is friendly and super knowledgeable and will always recommend something you'll enjoy. Try the wine from Rune, and support local  (Sonoita, AZ) growers and businesses."}
{"text":"Well I guess happy hour prices depend on when you pay not when you order. We stopped at 5:45 to get a glass of wine before dinner.  We were quickly pointed to the bar near the window. 10 minuets later someone took our order, but a wine tasting had just ended and the staff were busy processing orders. At 6:15 we were served. The patrons from the wine tasting were loud making it difficult to have a quiet conversation. It was like we walked into a party without an invitation. In addition, we like draft wine. Don't get it at Central Wine there draft Cabernet was ice cold. As cold as a beer. 

Bottom line don't get the draft red and don't stop if you see a crowd and want a quiet spot for a glass of wine."}
{"text":"A total hidden gem.  Friendly service and a great atmosphere.  Can't beat some charcuterie and Chardonnay on a hot summers day!"}
{"text":"This wine bar helped build the culture of mid- and uptown Phoenix to be hip and cool, before the recent boom. The classes and club were great, and cleared the path for other more recent places. Phoenix is a greater place for Central Wine being here. But all good things come to an end."}
{"text":"This was the perfect wine bar to celebrate my birthday with girl friends. The decor is chic, the room is small, and the seating is comfortable. We enjoyed the wine flights, charcuterie board, burrata, and customer service. If I ever find myself in Phoenix again I would definitely return for another visit."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite wine bar in Phoenix (and possibly AZ). The incredible wines, beautiful atmosphere that's perfect for a date or a conversation with your best friend, and the personable staff. I feel like I'm in the show Cheers when I head to central due to the staff members that have kind hearts and truly care about their customers (and show some friendly sass). I recommend this place to all of my friends and no one has been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but seems overpriced and the meat and cheese board was kind of a joke for the price - hardly any meat on it. Good atmosphere and wine though."}
{"text":"What a great find.  We were eating next door and wanted to grab another drink or two afterwards so we popped in here.  

The wine bar is cozy and adorable.  You have  your option of sitting at the bar or sitting in comfy upholstered chairs, couches, etc.  

There is a wide selection of wine available and the staff is very well informed to help with selections.  You can purchase by the glass or bottle.  While we did not order any food, we were served amazing popcorn that I fell in love with.  

The staff was extremely friendly, the space is beautiful and quaint. Great spot for a low key glass of wine with a bit of class."}
{"text":"Anywhere Herb Box Alicia is is FIVE STAR in my book!  The wines here are off the path fabulous and the burrata was warm, soft and supple...truly paired well with my red.  Thanks for enjoyable night."}
{"text":"Great comfy and cozy atmosphere! Staff is always friendly and inviting. The decor is simply stunning! Pop in for a wine flight, and take a few bottles home!"}
{"text":"While waiting for our table at Clever Koi, we came over for a drink and ended up liking our experience here , more than our experience at Koi.  

The ambiance is sexy-mature, sophisticated, and the staff are knowledgable.  

Thank you for the experience. :)"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place! It is the perfect size and feels so cozy inside. I could hang out here for hours (which I have). The wine selection changes on a regular basis and I like that they are trying to expose customers to new varietals and that they support local wines as well. They are always very friendly and helpful with wine selections - they will offer small tastings before you commit to a glass. Allie (sp?) has a great knowledge of the wine they are offering and is so personable and engaging that even if the wine was bad (which it is not) I would come back just for the energy she provides. The owner, Jenna (sp?), is almost always there and is also very warm and inviting. She is very in tune with what her customers want and will adjust her wine list to their needs or wants. This is the epitome of why one should support local. They care and listen. I have been there only a handful of times, yet every time I have gone I felt like a long lost relative or friend. Definitely worth checking out and once you go you will be hooked! Just don't take my seat at the bar!"}
{"text":"Fun place. Interesting selection of wines. Knowledgeable staff. Best of all, open later than similarly rated places."}
{"text":"Loved this place good wine good fun. They served popcorn with the wine. Which I loved"}
{"text":"Nice hideaway spot in the city. Great customer service and great wine selection. Calm and peaceful environment. Will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great little gem. Its a little pricey but its perfect for a date night or just to catch up with an old friend. The charcuterie board they offer was delicious and their wine is great. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"It looked like a cool casual place. Great decor. We went for a wine tasting.  The sommelier was not that good, a bit boring. I think they said the place was closing that same weekend."}
{"text":"Stopped in a few weeks ago. I love wine. Especially local wine. And I was really impressed with the wine selection. Outstanding. I couldn't of picked better wines myself. :)  The wines are pricey. But they are higher quality and local wines are always a bit more because they are smaller production. But they had a Syrah for $9 and we were there for Happy Hour so it was only $7. And that was a great deal for that wine. Pours were a pinch small. However she let us try a few before choosing one. That is a big plus. We ordered the meat and cheese board to pair. High quality meats and cheeses but portion was REALLY tiny. By far the skimpiest charcuterie board I have ever seen. It was $2 off because of it being HH. Maybe that was why. I would come back because the wine was excellent. And the atmosphere could not be better. Gorgeous. Honestly if money is not an issue it should be your go to place. Hands down. And if you appreciate good wine and local wine you should definitely check it out. Just don't go hungry. lol"}
{"text":"Try the Round Pond SB . . from Napa - 2012! Top it off with a French Grocery Meat & Cheese Board. Heaven! Thank You Local First for Introducing me to this wonderful new upscale hangout right on north Central. This neighborhood is up and coming. Don't overlook it! Recommendations to owners: Get some real forks for the Board! Plastic (even silver) doesn't go with French Country!"}
{"text":"Love this spot.  Great ambiance, nice bar, fantastic rotating wine selection featuring select regions, and can't beat a $12 flight.  The staff is always incredibly friendly and helpful and timely at replenishing your bowls of complimentary popcorn.  You can also buy bottles here or they'll order anything you want by the case with a little advance notice, all for extremely reasonable price points.  I hate to mention the free tastings on Fridays because I don't want to lose my place at the bar, but this place is such a gem it'll be hard to keep it quiet."}
{"text":"Relaxed, inviting and exciting.

You need to be here.

The wine has been a GREAT pick each time we have gone in. 

Every time we have talked to someone working there, it always sparks a friendly conversation that I take with me.

When I asked how to describe the style, \"farmhouse glam\" was the response. In looking around you can tell that is a incredibly accurate description on account of all the wood accents/ tin ceiling tiles and other little rustic details. Then there is a glamorous touch added with channelers and various shimmery elements to the bar that really make the place attractive and home-y, yet fancy all at the same time.

The wine has always been great and we feel so relaxed and welcomed, not to mention satisfied (did I mention we really like the wine?)

More on my blog, some cool pictures too!

{"text":"Great place to drop in with friends for wine and conversation. Complimentary cheese and veggies. Beautiful decor with ample bar and conversation seating."}
{"text":"Upscale decor, intimate setting.  Great ambience. Exceptional service, they even charged my phone for me!  Marvelous Moscato.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Found this little gem on Friday after a nice dinner out taking advantage of Restaurant Week. My friend and I just wanted to get a nice glass of wine to finish our meal and we couldn't have found a better spot! 

The décor is cute and modern/glam with a nice bar and cozy little spots to have quiet conversations. We sat at the bar and were immediately impressed by Kate, not only does she know her stuff, but she genuinely seems to love what she does and interacting with customers. I went for a wine flight and my friend got a glass of a very good Pinot Noir. We were even given a little side of complimentary popcorn which my friend enjoyed. 

I had such a great time, I came back the next night with another friend and Stuart was working that day. Both of my friends were impressed and wanted to come back for happy hour another time. This is a great little wine spot with passionate and knowledgeable staff, an awesome selection, and a cozy and chill atmosphere. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Great concept, cool decor. I'd be there often if I was living in the area."}
{"text":"My dad and I stopped by here on a whim a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it. The atmosphere is nice, super unpretentious and very chill vibe. Cozy couches and intimate. The employees were playing DJ and the music ranged from some great classic rock to early 90's hiphop. I think it would be a nice place for a date, as you could actually hear each other and get close. Both employees working were very helpful, had a sense of humor, and seemed happy to be there even though the place was somewhat empty. 

We were in on a Thursday, got in at about 6/630 and stayed until almost 9. They were in no rush to get us out the door either. While they do offer flights on Thursdays (4 tastings for $18), we opted to choose our own bottle from their huge selection. For a $5 corking fee, you can pick any of their wines to purchase and enjoy there. Our waitress helped us select a very good Italian blend that didn't break the bank and was just what we were looking for. 

As for food, well, don't expect much. There is only one option to purchase, a meat and cheese plate (which was quite tasty), and then a small bar snack which they bring out (ours happened to be popcorn). That's it. You come here for wine and conversation, not a meal. It's a place that you could start or end a night, or hell, do as we did and just make the wine your meal. 

We really enjoyed our time here and hope that this places makes it. The staff were great, wine selection seemed really well rounded (in terms of both selection and price range), and just the overall vibe is something that is missing in Phoenix. I look forward to returning and trying out a few other bottles."}
