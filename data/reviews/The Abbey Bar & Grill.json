{"text":"I was a regular here for a while, and I wish I could get every penny I spent back.  The food is terrible and it's usually empty except for a handful of regulars, who are pretty much all men. Some of them are nice. Some of them are awful, and they are friends with the owners, so they basically run the place. I was sexually harassed at the Abbey more times than I can count - intimately hugged, ogled, pawed at, leered at, flirted with. But they'd leave eventually and the hangs with the bartenders were always fun. The final straw came for me when, during an argument with one of the bar's resident creeps, he openly leered at my breasts, laughing. I started to cry. He was joined by Friday night's new karaoke host, who also commented on my breasts - absolutely unacceptable. If you cause a scene against one of the bar creeps, he will literally speed-dial the owners, who will show up whatever time of night to defend him.  I feel badly for having brought my friends (and family!) to this bar over the time I spent there, and definitely do not recommend anyone go there. There are other bars close by with better food, a cooler atmosphere, and who provide a safe space for their female patrons and staff. The Abbey does not do this. BEWARE."}
{"text":"Food is terrible.  The ribs tasted like an old wallet. Nachos were very bland with barely anything served on top. The fries tasted stale. The only thing that was somewhat edible were the chicken wings. I don't expect bar food to be top quality but this was shockingly bad. Prices for beer were decent so if you are going for just a drink it's an ok place but I would stay away from the food."}
{"text":"Disaster !  The website photos and menu descriptions sound ok but the reality is very poorly executed.  I had the grilled veggie wrap - which had no grilled veggies, just a salad wrap.  Pathetic.  My date had the shrimp - billed as HUGE on the menu but came as 5 of the tiniest shrimp...  However...they have a sunny patio and even with the street exposure a beer on a patio is always nice.  Just forget the food.  Hope they improve :("}
{"text":"Took 3 hours to get food. Ran out of corona. Server had attitude. Sound waaay too loud. Manager should consider staffing more people. Will not come back again."}
{"text":"I've walked by thus place several times but finally decided to go in to watch a Euro game.  This place gives every impression that it should be an awesome place to watch sports but is missing several key elements.  First, the TV quality is very low so sitting even a few feet from a screen makes following a game quite challenging.  The owners should seriously consider upgrading.  Second, the owner awkwardly hovers around the restaurant.  He must have made 40-50 laps around the place.  It makes you feel very uncomfortable and very bad for the one waitress who was frantically trying serve the entire place.  The food was okay and the drinks are not over priced (not cheap either).  But I can't imagine a universe where I would return to this place."}
{"text":"The service is horrible, it takes forever to get a drink. Food is greasy and unappetizing. Has about as much ambiance as an airport checkin counter. Pretty much nothing good to say about this place, you get the picture."}
{"text":"Want to get harassed by old men? Feel physically threatened? This is a great place to go if you're looking to be made to feel incredibly uncomfortable. I feel bad for the staff--who are very pleasant--but the regulars at this bar are super sketchy. Came for the karaoke, left because of the creeps."}
{"text":"The patio at the once and Future Abbey (the place has changed owners a couple times) has been, in great weather, one of the few places in the 'hood where you can experience afternoon sun and invite everyone you know to join you, while being sure there will be room for everyone.  It's large and street-adjacent, with a high enough fence to block some traffic noise but still let you say hi to passers-by: perfect for a lazy evening drinking.  Yet somehow two beers and a bite to eat will run you $30+ while simultaneously being gigantically disappointing.  You will eventually find that even your most accepting of friends will no longer say \"yes\" if you invite them here, and instead, after an \"umm\" and a long pause, suggest a patio farther away but more effectively tended.  I, and probably many others, would be regulars here if they could get their act back to even vaguely acceptable. It's a shame and a waste of what could be a great patio.  Clean your act up, Abbey!"}
{"text":"Ugh. Food is crap. If Ur famished, the dry Cajun wings are a safe bet. Comes with celery and carrot and fries. Food has been a disappointment for years. Patio is nice though. The regulars are good guys and entertaining. Karaoke is fun."}
{"text":"Man...The Abbey.  I've had the misfortune of living a minute away from this place for the last four years, and so, out a desire for extreme convenience, I've given it a number of chances.  Here's what you need to know:  - The pretty Asian girls who work the bar may not know what a Jack and Coke is, but if you do enough pointing and talking very slowly, you can have one for eight dollars. They may need some help finding the button on the computer.   - The Makers Mark is not Makers Mark. My guess tonight was that they had filled it with Northern Harvest rye, which, if you're going to fill bottles with other stuff, ain't a bad choice.  - They do karaoke twice a week, although it seems like they do karaoke every night. This is actually my favourite thing about the place. I've enjoyed being a fly-on-the-wall throughout, in a sort of social-experimenty way (I fucking sang a few times okay? Don't give me grief). There's an old dude who is here every single karaoke night. He looks like a biker extra from a Canadian film shoot, he has crazy eyes. He will try and make eye contact with you. He will sing an 80s tune that is long forgotten by most, but presumably held dear to him. His friend, a younger, portly gentleman with long hair and a goatee, will put everything he has into Pearl Jam's \"Jeremy\". Him and the old man will chastise the younger participants for lacking proper mic technique. Arghghg millennials!   - The layout of this place doesn't make sense. I feel like I'm in an off-broadway Alice In Wonderland production.   - I once tried to dine and dash here, after I couldn't take money out of the ATM. I had been drinking all day, and just couldn't be bothered to figure it out. One of the girls chased me down the street, and dragged me back. I knew the jig was up. I didn't even fight back. I was sleepy! After the cops detained me, I protested, handcuffed in the backseat, and asked the officers if they had enjoyed the first season of True Detective. I mean, who the hell hadn't?! Long story short, I went back a few days later and paid my thirty dollar tab. I felt extreme guilt.  $3.50 Jaggers."}
{"text":"This bar must have changed hands since my last visit. They have a cool space, lots of TV's, and a big, full bar.   Tonight the woman serving us did not speak much english, nor did she understand our orders - I see this as the main issue, because that is where the issues started.  There was plenty of staff working but only the bar guy had fluent English comprehension and speaking.  Our order came out extremely slow, we were not served at the same time, 2 of the 3 of us did not get our drinks, and the food order was 100% incorrect.  My husband ordered a meal thay did not come out at all.  7 innings worth of time to get our first plate of food...not even close to what anyone ordered... Game was over... Still no drinks... tried to bill us for food, drinks, other people's stuff...  The bar was relatively quiet for a Jays game being on, the kitchen maybe only turned out 8 plates for the whole game but the Bar guy said the kitchen was overwhelmed.  Mom asked them to remove all the random charges (someone obviously combine two tables bill-wise) I think the real issue is the servers misunderstanding the patrons/not knowing the system and things getting punched in incorrectly or not at all.  WATCH YOUR BILL HERE!!!   Bad, bad experience. We paid our approx $32.00 bill, left and immediately ordered pizza.  I used to love Abbey for the atmosphere, cold beer and Fish & Chips... All those things I loved are long gone.  Big miss, I'll go back on Karaoke night and not eat and we will see if they have things more together... 0/5 for this experience."}
{"text":"Came to the Abbey on a Saturday night expecting a fun night of karaoke, laughs, dancing and an all around great time. Instead I got awkward bartenders, last call at 1:20 and lights on at 1:40. When another Patron asked the bar tender why they were closing up so early they refused to give an answer, I just assumed they wanted to go home as soon as possible. The only reason I'm giving them a bonus star instead of just one star is because the bar specials are super cheap. Other than that it's pretty Sub-par service.   Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We came here because the place we wanted to go was full.  Though to be fair we probably should have just gone home. The service was abysmal and hilariously slow especially given the fact that the bar was empty it should have been faster.  I ordered a BLT which arrived on barely toasted wonder bread, with mealy  tomatoes and raw bacon.  If your on college and hungry give this hole a miss and go somewhere else...."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Very unorganized staff. Forgot about our drinks and food. I'd suggest writing orders down next time, it's not that hard to do! It wasn't even very busy and the lack of service was terrible."}
{"text":"We love this place ! It's our neighbourhood go-to spot, and they let us have our dog on the front patio ! We usually go for the chicken wings on Tuesdays and they are awesome ! Don't listen to all these pretentious fuck bag hipsters, who knew it was a dive sports bar when they walked in. Hopefully this place never gets sold or changed."}
