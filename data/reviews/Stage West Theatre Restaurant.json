{"text":"I have been both a worker and a customer here. The plays are honestly amazing and I think the food is average. Nothing too special. Though the tarts there are AMAZING. I also love the eggs Benedict there.    As a worker I tell you it's hard work. There is so many people who ask for drinks and there are many plates to bring. I beg you, treat the workers with respect.   The whole experience  is great. Try the Shirley temple as a drink. Though for people with babies there is no changing place."}
{"text":"'My dog groomer treated me to a nite out for \"Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps!\" 'First trick she taught me is that when you park go down a wee bit past the regular Stage West parking on the right hand side of 42nd as well, ' to the private parking lot. 'Alot of the reserved parking is just till 5PM and since your show will probably start at 6PM you're good to go and will not get caught up in the rush to exit at the end, yeah! We had nice seats, $62. got us a sitting just a few rows down on the main level at Center Stage. Yeah again. The buffet was huge. The sushi was very fresh however hastily cut up and presentation sucked, big pieces of tuna and salmon slammed altogether on a pile. 'Just a wee blip tho as there was so much food to choose from, 'salads galore, every kind of seafood from wee crab legs to giant shrimp, the veggie tempura was excellent, deserts were plentiful and delish, lots of kinds of meat, pasta, potatoes, 'you will get very well fed and if you didn't eat abundantly before the show you have a second chance at the half hour intermission. The show didn't start till 7:45PM so that was almost two hours to visit and dine! Wine was minimal and regularly priced, 'approx. $23. for two glasses of acceptable Merlot.  The show was so imaginative, fast paced, 4 actors played approx. 150 characters. 'Funny, great acting, 'well recommended! Our Tuesday nite was probably only about 1 third full so it felt nice to not feel hemmed in to our seats. There appear to be at least three private rooms seating 8-10 guests in balcony seating above the main level too.   Two thumbs up for an approx 4 hour outing, 'the audience for this show was mostly older couples, however I'm sure that can vary depending on the show."}
{"text":"Shows are always top notch, excellent selections at the buffet. My only concern is since we have season tickets for the sunday brunch performance there isn't much change in the menu from performance to performance. Just saw Fox on the Fairway and it was hilarious. Definitely give it a chance especially any of the musicals."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun we had at Avenue Q...food was good, service was good. Only 4 stars because the location blowwwwwws and really kills a buzz being way out in the boonies."}
{"text":"Most of the shows that I have been to have been good or above average. We went to Madonna and it was quite disappointing. I was mislead in my mind on the type of production it was going to be. Not the quality of production that I would expect from Stage West. Food was good as usual and was not disappointed.  Unexspectedly I received a call from Stage West. They offered a complimentry performance and meal to make up for the Madonna show. I chose the Elvis performance and this made up for Madonna by far. Two thumbs up and Thank You Stage West. I / we will be back."}
{"text":"We saw And Then The Lights Went Out... the show itself was great! Kept your interest, had action, and humor. Very well done.  Our service was really good, and had some great recommendations on drinks. The food, there was a ton of it, all kinds, something for everyone. Unfortunately, yes, it's buffet style, which is perfect, BUT the food was very, very cold. I got chicken that felt like it came right out of the fridge. Considering the tickets were quite expensive, I figured the food would be a little better.  Other than that, it was a good time."}
{"text":"Saw Chicago here and it was a weird vibe. The production was excellent. Given a limited stage they managed to pull off a production that punches above its weight. I just kind of felt weird here. The age is significantly more skewed to an older crowd. The buffet was a weird concept. Technically you can get roast beef, claims and sushi on the same plate.   I had a great time, but I think it was more my company. I did like the fact that they moved us to better seats and gave a discount for the odd seats we had. I'm glad I tried it, but might not try it again."}
{"text":"Yeah. First and likely last time I'll go here.  Hostess was totally rude, we got the bill for our drinks before our drinks even showed up and even then they were wrong. The show, Avenue Q was awesome,  but the food and service left something to be desired. When I booked online I chose a table a bit back from the stage, yet when I got my tickets for my friends and I this morning,  they were not the ones I selected and paid for. When I showed the box office staff the confirmation email and the tickets I got a \"sorry nothing we can do\" attitude. I won't get into the food suffice to say it was lackluster. Oh. And the enforcing of the dress code?  Total stupidity. People in jeans got in, and an older gent in nice dressier shorts got asked to leave. WHAT A JOKE."}
{"text":"Entertaining and great selection at the buffet. Went for our staff Christmas party, Dec 2015 for the 80's Solid Gold 2 performance. The performers were very good, entertaining and funny at times. Thanks for all the effort from kitchen, servers, performers, stage production etc! Look forward to returning in the future."}
{"text":"Being someone who has been fortunate enough to have seen broadway in Chicago and incredible shows in Toronto, I gotta be honest: When it comes to theatre, my expectations are very high.  I've been to Stage West about 6 times and yes, it is one of the best theatre companies in Calgary. In the world however, it pales in comparison.   The acting at Stage West is good. The casts work very hard and the productions are well done.   The stage itself is quite small, however the entire space of the theatre is impressive as they have full size dinner tables throughout the area.  What I love about Stage West is that you can eat while you're watching the performance. However now that I've seen better performances, I wonder if this is a gimmick to take a bit of attention off the show itself? I know that's a little harsh, but none of the mainstream broadway shows ever allow food in the theatre...your full attention is on the production and ONLY on the production.  The buffet at Stage West isn't that great for vegetarians. You can let them know ahead of time that you're vegetarian and they'll stirfry veggies for you or make you some veggie pasta. As for the buffet itself, if you're a vegetarian and are expecting to fill up without giving them advance notice, then expect to fill up on raw veggies, salads and dessert. I've gotten to know the rumballs at this buffet a little too well... the sprinkle ones are my favourites :)  Right, back to business. The other thing I don't love about eating while watching the show is that mid way through the show, you get REALLY uncomfortable. Dinner tables aren't made for sitting and watching theatre and even if you turn your chair to face the stage, it still gets really uncomfortable.  Overall, I like the traditional form of theatre. If my options are watching an ALRIGHT show during a meal, or watching a top notch show in a top notch theatre, I pick the latter."}
{"text":"This place has definitely gone down hill from what it used to be.  My parents love this stuff, so we got my mom tickets to the Johnny Cash tribute.   We got there super early so we were able to get a parking spot by the door. Otherwise you need to park behind the building and walk around, which is ok in summer. Little dicey in winter time.   The buffet isn't as good as it used to be either. While I truly do appreciate them stating what is gluten free, they should probably make sure the facts are right. Thankfully I'm a seasoned celiac, so I know, but for a newbie, there was a couple dishes that would have made a person sick. Teriyaki is full of gluten.   And there is not ONE gluten free dessert. Well cept fruit, but let's be honest, we do like to eat other things than rabbit food.   The show was good though, great songs and good people to play the roles."}
{"text":"80's night was awesome! The singers were all talented and hearing their 80's rendition was worth the price ticket alone. The buffet is really good. Garlic shrimp made right in front of you. Several types of sashimi and tobiko. Ravoli, fried shrimp and salt and pepper ribs were my favourite. However, everyone else loved turkey, roast beef, several salads, cold shrimp, fish, chicken dishes and two long tables worth of desserts. I heard that Stage West will have 80s Night II. Count me in. :-) Only negative - lots of seniors so be respectful when they need to pass and the washrooms have a nasty odour by the end of the night :-("}
{"text":"A friend invited me here once. Food was good, play was okay but I'm not a fan of stage play so felt a little bored but the buffet is good"}
{"text":"I like dinner theatre; you can enjoy a leisurely meal and watch a show at the same time. Recently I took in Avenue Q at Stagewest. The show was great, the characters were well cast. The food at Stagewest is served buffet style and at best average. You have the requisite peel and eat shrimp station, a sushi station, and 2 stations of hot food serving the same dishes and prime rib station, a salad station and cheese and dessert station. The food at Stagewest would be average. There was really nothing great about it. The peel and eat Shrimp were my favourite as the shrimp were larger than most places. The sushi looked good but there was nothing out of the ordinary served. The prime rib was overcooked and tough. The hot dishes were mostly over salted. Desserts were a good selection of cakes, fruit and they had hot desserts like crepes filled with banana and topped with whipped cream. The beauty of buffet is that you can usually find something that you think is good and you can stick with it.  The service is excellent and efficient. The dessert buffet remains open till the end of intermission so you can pace yourself and enjoy your entrees with a break before heading out to get dessert.  The overall event was enjoyable but I would definitely not go to Stagewest just for the food. The food is not as good as it was when Stagewest first opened its doors many years ago. We went on a special groupon deal and paid $70 and it was definitely worth that."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my time at Stage West. Great food and show. Love the chocolate dipped cookies."}
{"text":"This is my third time coming here and my husband's first time.   We came to see \"Two Hit Wonders\".  It was an absolutely brilliant show--great staging, live band--it really took us down memory lane...  Food:    Cold seafood--there is a raw oyster bar, but sorry, I'm not a raw oyster fan.  I didn't try the cold peel-and-eat shrimps this time because there was something better at the hot entree station.  The Alaskan king crab claws were very bland; they didn't taste like crab at all(just the texture).  Maybe they should have cooked the claws first and before splitting them lengthwise...          After reading some of the reviews here and on Urbanspoon, I didn't want to take my chances at the Sushi bar.  At the \"chefs cook while you wait\" station:  today's special was Chicken Karaage.  The chicken was very well seasoned but I wasn't very impressed with the batter.  It was too dense and heavily coated(needless to say I ate only the chicken).         Though about a year ago I had the wild mushroom risotto at this station and it was heavenly(I am generally not a rice fan).  Hot Entree Station:  the really great thing about the setup at Stage West is that there are two identical hot entree stations(to handle large crowds).  The green beans almondine were very fresh, the beef short ribs(cut Korean kalbi style) were delicious, Thai spicy(actually very mild) chicken was pretty good(a bit Westernized) and the Lemongrass jumbo shrimp were to die for.   I wasn't too impressed with the blue cod with crabmeat.  The cod was a bit too fishy for my taste.  Carving station:  I had some excellent medium-rare roast beef with gravy.   The turkey(even though I requested dark meat) was on the dry side, though.  Dessert:   I was too full to eat dessert, so I just grazed on the assorted cheeses(I left the blue cheese for hubby) and fruit(pineapple was quite sweet this time around.  There were also cantaloupe, honeydew, grapes, and watermelon.)"}
{"text":"I love Stage West.  It was a good way to introduce my daughter to theatre.  If she didn't enjoy the show (more adult content), she loved the food and dressing up.  For the more adult shows, I invited a friend.  The best deal is the 2 for 1 shows in the Season's Pass.  The food is always great and the productions wonderful.  Usually the best show of the year is around Christmas / start of the New Year.  She also loved Stage West for Kids! The food is very kid friendly, and the actors run through the audience."}
{"text":"First experience of stage wast was good,the show was well done  over all it was a good time.  I have to say that the parking is not the best and if you don't get there early you way at the back and if you get there early then you are eating to much to past the time till the show starts.   The food is buffet food nothing I can say was overly good that I would have to rant on about. I basically enjoyed a large plate of fruit and cream puffs."}
{"text":"Food: I love the many choices of dairy and gluten free salads and hot foods that are freshly made. Lots of fresh fruit to chose from. Cost: we have seasons tickets and for a live play and all you can eat high quality buffet, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I saw \"Two Hit Wonders\" -- the show was entertaining for me because it covered popular music from the latter half of the 20th century, which was a formative time for me. I didn't sample anything from the cold buffet, but the hot dishes were all delicious. This was my first and only visit (so far), and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Having been here once before and had a pleasant experience, we decided to revisit Stage West once again.   Let me just say, I was surprised- Surprised at how DOWNHILL everything went from the last time we were here.   The food was similar to that of mediocre cafeteria food: bland, dry, oily and simply DISGUSTING. Unfortunately, this is far from an exaggeration. My mom got a leg of king crab that was discoloured and soured. I had a piece of bone dry fish with little to no seasoning. The bread rolls were stale and the \"fresh\" fruit was bitter and incredibly mushy. FRUIT. How in the world could you possibly mess up fruit?!   I wish I were making this up. As I write this review, it does sound absurd that a place could be this horrendous. But I shit you not.   The only reason that this review has a star at all is because the performance got a few chuckles out of us.   Please. If you are coming here for the food, don't bother coming at all!"}
{"text":"Welcome to my first live review. What does that mean? It means I'm writing it from my table at Stage West. Thanks, iPhone.   This our first visit to Stage West after they completed renovations. Not much has changed, but the newly created buffet room is a definite improvement. In the past, while structured, the trip to the buffet was almost always a long wait. With the new room, people move through rather briskly and the food is easier to access. My only gripe is that the food isn't clearly labeled, so it's easy to visit the same station twice (as there are duplicate stations).  The food quality was excellent, no huge surprise here.  I've rarely heard anything bad about the food at Stage West.  I was pleasantly surprised by the Dijon Panko Crusted Rack of Lamb.  I'm a huge lamb fan, having grown up eating it regularly.  So it was nice to see it on the menu and even nicer to find it was prepared well.  The beef was about what you would expect and the Sauteed Jumbo Shrimps with Garlic Butter & Cognac, which is prepared for you as you wait, was delicious.  The deserts were good, but nothing fantastic.  I was a little disappointed by the selection, which seems to have gotten smaller since our last visit.  On to the show.  We had the pleasure of watching Married Alive, staring Joyce DeWitt of Three's Company fame.  The most important thing here is that we genuinely enjoyed the show.  I have a few critiques, but overall the show was fun.  I found Joyce DeWitt's performance to be wonderful, although it took a bit of adjustment to get used to her.  The problem here is that the playbill is still using a photo from her Three's Company days.  Likely taken almost 30 years ago, she does not look the same.  She looks great, don't get me wrong, but it was just unexpected to be inundated with photos of a 20-30 something and then being greeted by a woman who just turned 60.  The supporting players were good, although at times hard to hear.  Both of the younger performers, Tory Doctor and Ksenia Thurgood, seemed to struggle projecting their voices when singing.  But maybe it's just me.  The play itself was good, but a bit slow.  The first act was fun, funny, and energetic.  The second slowed down quite a bit and was somewhat disappointing.  Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"Loved stage west! The 80' show and the most recent 90's were super entertaining and enjoyable to watch.  The cast were exceptional and all had great voices...some wonderful talent and well put together.  The host was also talented and very funny. They hit the nail on the head for this show.... we talked about it for days...haha. Time definitely flew by and I didn't want it to end.   The buffet was also very well done with some very tasty food options. From crab legs, to seafood chefs dishes, to risotto, sushi, roast beef, to gluten free items...I'm certain they covered it all. Even the dessert was decent...even though I was too full to try any of it...they had three buffet sections so you don't ever have to deal deal with long line ups.   Great job overall from the buffet to shows. Would definitely recommend trying Stage West for a good night out."}
{"text":"I took my Dad here for a belated Father's Day gift as it's something he really enjoys doing. I had never been here before, but knew about the dinner theatre idea having been to Jubilations a number of times. I hear this is the more upscale version. Our show was called \"The Marvellous Wonderettes\", and we had a nice booth at the back, centre stage.  When I called to reserve our tickets, I was slightly disappointed that I couldn't pay for them at the door, but I suppose that's understandable. The girl on the phone was really accommodating when I was forced to choose between two tables and wanted to ensure the best view. I was really happy with her suggestion on the booth!  We arrived early in order to have time to browse the buffet and enjoy our food without rushing. I liked that beside each item of food was a small card stating what it was, and if it included gluten or dairy. My dad is trying to eat gluten free so I thought that was really helpful. I loaded my plate with crab legs, shrimp, assorted salads, cheese, beef, and some other delicious items. Don't get me started on the desserts! Drool. The food was very good, as far as buffet food goes.  The show was cute, the actresses/singers were extremely talented and the show was funny and entertaining. It was a lot more singing than I was expecting, but it was fun as the songs were hits from the 50's & 60's. I actually knew and recognized a few of them and I think my dad enjoyed hearing the classics. As the show only had 4 cast members, the production level was somewhat limited, but it was great.  Our waitress was friendly and came around often. I did try a champagne cocktail and it was wonderful. We did have to pay extra for our drinks, in addition to the price for dinner and the show. That being said, it's a pretty pricey evening for two people - around $250 for the show, dinner, and drinks. All in all we had a lot of fun and I would consider going back if there was an especially interesting show on (or if someone else was paying...haha!).  Side note: My dad had some pretty gnarly stomach issues that night, but I was fine. We think it may have been the octopus as that was the only thing he ate but I didn't. We cant be sure, but you're taking your chances with any seafood buffet food!"}
{"text":"the food at the buffet was terrible,  worst than its ever been. I took my husband there for a special birthday evening and we were both so disappointed. the show was great but I don't know if we will ever go back because the food was horrible.  also the waitress kept insisting we order another drink,  she wouldn't leave us alone, high pressure,  not appreciated."}
{"text":"Overall, Stage West has offered the best dinner theatre experiences I've had in Calgary.  The evening and weekend tickets are pricy but the food is excellent and they do bring in veteran actors.  The most recent production I saw was very adult and not a musical, which was a nice change.  My recommendation is to attend Sunday brunch.  The price is much more reasonable and some of the breakfast food is absolutely stellar, like the french toast and everything at the scrambled eggs station.     I think this is a fantastic outing for small groups.  Review 29 for Yelp's 30 Day Challenge - Nov 2012"}
{"text":"So my 2 stars is based more on the food then the show. The show was great (Motown) but the buffet was just whatever. If you are not a huge seafood fan then I would suggest you go elsewhere because you don't get the most bang for your buck.   The desserts were pretty lame. Too bad. I used a groupon so I only paid half price. There is no way  I would pay $98. Plus drinks are not included, there free refills on coffee but that's it.    I had tons of fun watching the show but the food was a huge let down. But if you love seafood maybe check it out. I think I'll stick to Jubilation's."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Stage West in more than 20 years so I guess just the fact that Stage West has been around for so long shows how much people in the city enjoy coming here.   My wife and I snagged my parent's seasons tickets for the Suite Surrender show Sunday night. We were shown to our table which was right in the middle of the room. Our sever was friendly and was right on top of our drink situation the whole night offering refills and making sure we had everything we needed.  The buffet has a good selection, though some items could have been a little more fresh. I particularly enjoyed the small sushi station and the shrimp. There's also a good sized desert buffet. Mostly cold items like squares and tarts, but they also served a warm pineapple upside-down cake.  The show was great. It was funny with good one liners and perfectly timed punchlines."}
{"text":"I've been lucky enough to visit Stage West a handful of times... my parents have season tickets so whenever they don't want to go, I get to.  It rocks!  I seriously love Stage West days.  I've only been for the lunch performances but I say with great conviction that it's up there with the best way to spend brunch time.  The food they have is breakfast combined with dinner, so you can pretty much eat anything.  It's buffet-style so you can choose what you eat and how much.  The cost of food is incorporated into the ticket so don't feel bad about stuffing your face until you think you'll explode!  My favourite thing about Stage West is that you can eat during the performance.  I usually start my meal with breakfast, then go for seconds to get salads and more lunchtime food, then I go for thirds and stock a plate (or a couple) full of fruit and desert... oh, and one plate for shrimp.  I love being able to snack away on the food while the show is on.  Food aside - because I could talk about it forever - the shows are always a lot of fun.  There isn't usually much audience participation, but that doesn't even matter.  Stage West always chooses the best plays, mostly comedies or musicals, and the production are extravagant and outstanding.  The actors and technical support really go out of their way to put on a great performance.    The place is pretty big, with plenty of seating, but there isn't a bad seat in the house.  They have it laid out so that no matter where you are you're getting a good view of the show.  The price of the tickets may be a little expensive (which is why I'm glad my parents give me their season tickets sometimes) but I definitely think it's worth it.  After all, you get as much food as you can fit in your belly (or purse) and then a wonderfully performed production.  This place is a little fancy, so don't dress too casual.  I really do love going to Stage West... what a great way to spend time with your family, or have a nice date with you significant other!"}
{"text":"Great show (Avenue Q) and a really great buffet. My best friend and I have been coming to Stage West for years and I have to say this is the best season food wise. So much to choose from and a decent amount of Gluten Free friendly desserts (obviously important).  Plus...$75 for a show and dinner is pretty great.  Go check it out and support local theatre!"}
{"text":"Stage West has recently finished its renovations.  The buffet for lunch is in a separate room.  Overall, not too bad a buffet.  Still working out the kinks, I think, about what to serve and how much to serve.    The seating area in the theatre part is now extended now that the buffet was taken out.  Love the mussels and shrimp in the appetizer side of the buffet!  Delicious and very fresh.    The butterfly shrimp was so good.  Yum!    Smaller selection of desserts.  Hopefully, they will come out with more desserts."}
{"text":"What an amazing show.  And the food wow.  Super exited to go back again.  I didn't get the table I want but I'm not a princess. And the table I had was just as great.   Looking forward to coming back again. Amazing food service and the show must go on.  Also super clean :). I think the cost should go up a bit"}
{"text":"We went for the New Years Eve dinner and show this year.  We haven't been to Stage West for many years but had pleasant memories of a great atmosphere and amazing food.  How things have changed. Sure there is lots of food and by the number of trips people were making the quantity seemed to win over quality. Nothing we ate was warm never mind hot which works for the salad bar but not much else. It was also bland and seemed uneventful.   We enjoyed a couple of cocktails that were ok and surprisingly not badly priced.   The show was good and entertaining with lots of good memory songs.  The stars are for the efforts put in by the cast who worked hard to keep the mood lively.   The decor was the same as the last time we were there.... at least ten years ago, thinking that updates would go a long way.    Think we will wait another 10 plus years to go again but doubt it can compete if this experience was the event put on for such a special evening."}
