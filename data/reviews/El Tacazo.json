{"text":"My spouse and I just went to order take out and try this Tacazo place afer we bought a house here a ago and we love it. The Shrimp Burrito has become our new favorite burrito for South Mountain. Can't wait to try out the other menu items!!!!! YUMMY Shrimp Burrito!!!!!"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning after eating a chicken burrito from this place about five years ago. I have never been back since. It also made me not want to eat a burrito from any other place. I slowly have eased my way back to enjoying burritos this year."}
{"text":"This is the most fantastic Mexican food ever. I can not live without eating here at least once a week. Everything is good. The manager must keep this store on point. Great horchata too!!!!"}
{"text":"Best carne asada burritos this side of town. The ladies are nice. The place is not the fanciest but it's always clean. The prices are fair."}
{"text":"Green chili burrito is all I have ever ordered but the best I have ever had.  The price is a bit high for me and had risen over the past year.  Not sure if it's still worth the money so I don't go as often. Burrito would benefit from adding in more meat. Otherwise is  Very good."}
{"text":"Best shrimp burrito in the valley, so under the radar amazing. Been going here for a year, everything is authentic Mexican food with traditional recipes. Drive thru is quick. Salsa is amazing. MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mexican food but I can't lie sometimes it does make my stomach hurt but I still love it the horchata is so good must have"}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant offers good eatin' on the cheap. Located in a busy strip mall (as a detached building) in a busy stretch of South Central Avenue near Broadway, it was recommended by a Mexican friend who described it as being \"closest to Mexican home cooking as it can get, for a restaurant.\" I enjoyed eating in this place because it is spacious for its size, a large illustrated menu hovers over the counter, the prices are low, the food is savory - the vinegar, cilantro, and other seasonings stand out without being overpowering - and they have great flan! Sure to be a preferred dining stop during my trips to the areas south of downtown."}
{"text":"Chicken is frozen from a bag. Tortillas are common grocery store tortilla. They don't even have lime...  what a joke."}
{"text":"This would easily be a 5 star rating if I just ordered the tacos when I come here But my favorite is their burrito de lengua. Sadly the flavor/ingredients/quality of that particular burrito varies greatly with it not being as delicious as I remember it most times. I don't know if they have changed chefs or just don't make it fresh like they used to but the last couple times I've had it I was greatly dissapointed."}
{"text":"You. Complete. Me.  Tried this lil diamond in the rough by accident. You see, Dos Molinos was closed and I needed authentic Mexican fare in my belly. Stat.  Had seafood soup and it was superb. Try that w/a cold Modelo (can) w/a lot of limes and it shouldn't disappoint!  Plus, loved ordering in Spanish - felt in made my food even tastier."}
{"text":"Walked in and was hit with the smell of bleach..well at least the place is clean, I thought. Looked over the menu. Ordered 3 asada tacos, large horchata, asked if I wanted jalapeno I said sure thinking they were free..no they are 50 cents extra-whatever. Took my receipt, sat down and waited 5 minutes they called my number, tacos were the tiny double tortilla variety. The meat was nice and tender, well seasoned. The baggie of jalapenos had two big pickled peppers, two lemon wedges and a few sliced carrots. I asked for salsa on the side. The horchata was delicious. The tacos were good, topped with onions and cilantro. As I was eating a really great song I love came on so I guess the ambiance was ok too. Good food, good service. Would come back again for the horchata as it was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"This place never seems to fail me! Definitely try the horchata and carne asada tacos!"}
{"text":"horrible place to eat i got food poisoning & am pregnant so it realy sucks!! i also found a hair in my sour cream iwent on 4/19/2018 would not recommend it!!"}
