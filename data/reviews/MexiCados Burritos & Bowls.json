{"text":"Best burrito in the city. Have tried many from many different restaurants.  The owner is so nice and seems to really get to know you and your taste before suggesting and putting together your meal. Got a regular size burrito (Which was HUGE) and a burrito bowl. Even had different unique sauces other burrito places dont offer. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Great burrito and bowl place. Nice owners and very friendly. The mole sauce is wonderful and we had the steak burrito and chicken bowl both which were great."}
{"text":"I just went for lunch with my best friend. It was so delicious for a good price. I let the chef drive and put what he thought I'd like in a steak quesadilla; best decision ever. Quality ingredients as you don't feel like crap afterwards like you do eating at other restaurants.  Try the speciality soda they have from Mexico. I look forward to going back. Also, ALOT of different coffee flavors available."}
