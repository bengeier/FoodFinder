{"text":"Superb pastries and great sandwiches especially like Blackbird bread ,  Chocolate chip cookie wwas to die for!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute breakfast/lunch place. I got the tofu salad with a medium coffee. Tofu salad was a bit pricey at $12.50. At first I was skeptical because it was just spinach, brown rice, peanuts, Edamame, tofu and black sesame seeds not like the fancy salads at kupfert and kim/IQ foods that are full of different ingredient, but that quickly changed. The more I ate the salad, the more I enjoyed how the creamy peanut dressing went with the simplicity of the ingredients. The tofu was soft and creamy and there was just the right amount of dressing for my liking (I like my salads lightly dressed). I was surprised that I was so full after eating the salad. The drip coffee was really good. They use propeller coffee beans here."}
{"text":"I visited this little cute shop this morning. What a wonderful little gem in the downtown core. The selection of pastries and baked treats is endless and everything looks absolutely delicious. I had an almond milk latte which was yum and the vegan hemp protein bar. Let me say the protein bar was the best homemade bar I have ever tasted, I wish I had gotten two.  I will definitely stop by again to grab more treats. They had this made to order s'mores bar which had my mouth watering and I think I will have trouble choosing just one treat next time. I recommend this spot to anyone looking for something a little different and a bit more special."}
{"text":"I never thought I would be excited about a Tuna sandwich. But the Tuna sandwich itself is something worth going out of your way to enjoy. 

The cookies are outstanding with something as simple as a speculoos is glorious... Peanut butter cookies with chocolate in the middle is just brilliant.

Also, as a tea drinker the fact they stock Sloane teas is just awesome."}
{"text":"excellent for biz meeting catering - easy to work with - great options"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the downtown core. Lovely little place with delicious lunch options and the desserts are incredible. The choux balls will change your life."}
{"text":"My review is based on takeout desserts. 

This little cafe is clean and have one long communal table with high top chairs which caters to patrons on the go.

I go bought (best in order) hazelnut raspberry, raspberry pistachio choux puff, creme brulee choux puff, and coconut cream for a house warming. All were crowd pleaser. Very light, not too sweet and the ones with fruit is refreshing. My friends described the hazelnut raspberry as a mochi filled with mousse with crunchy ingredients inside (can't put my finger on it but almost like rice Krispy?) 

Service was good as well. Very patient since I'm quite indecisive...

Prices are a bit high for pastries that aren't well known and the cafe doesn't specialize in desserts. It was $21.50 for 4 desserts. 

Would suggest for more variety but the ones they have already has won me over."}
{"text":"Updated review for more vegan and vegetarian goodness here!

5/5 vegan protein bar - made with nuts, seeds, dried fruit, nut butter, etc. It's moist, sticky, sweet, and just so good! This was my favourite pastry today! Definitely took me by surprise how yummy it actually is! I love the gooey, chewy texture. Tastes more like a decadent dessert than a nutritious protein boost :)

2/5 vegan oats bar - This was on the house today, thank you! Maybe it's because I had it just after the protein bar, but I definitely didn't experience as much joy with this one. Not sweet or gooey enough imo, but if you like drier, less sweet desserts this one is for you.

3.5/5 vegan morning glory cookie- Also on the house today, many thanks to the wonderful owner :) I liked this one more in part because it was sweeter, but it still paled in comparison to the protein bar. The ingredient list is similar to the vegan breakfast cookie at Neo Coffee, but this version is drier. 

Will be back for more vegan treats!"}
{"text":"Little stop-in cafe on Adelaide. They have a large assortment of sandwiches and salads - a good choice for lunch if you're in the area. I had the chia seed chocolate pudding! It was about $5 and came topped with fresh fruit. Tres bien, Bisous"}
{"text":"Located on the northwest corner of Adelaide Street East and Church Street (just across from Terroni), this is the new kid on the block of the Toronto cafe scene and it seems to have all the ingredients to be a pretty successful one - variety of fresh pastries, sandwiches, salads, delicious coffee, decent amount of seating, nice large windows with the sunlight streaming into the shop making for a nice cafe environment, cute and cheerful decor, and friendly staff.

I dropped by on a weekday morning for a treat and much-needed coffee and was pretty impressed. Prices are a little on the higher side, but the quality of the products are top-notch. I ordered a shortbread cookie and two coffees (one for a colleague - $2.25 each). The shortbread cookie (at $2.50) was denser than I expected, but buttery and delicious. I was really impressed with their drip coffee - which, as others have mentioned, they source from Propeller coffee in Toronto. I barely even had to add sugar - the beans weren't over roasted at all, and was wonderfully deep and delicious. 

As of my visit last week, they hadn't received their espresso machine yet, so they were only serving drip coffee. However, it looks like they'll be getting it in soon, so I'm excited to come back and try out their specialty drinks. A great addition to the Toronto cafe scene, and I'll certainly be back!

For a shortbread cookie and two coffees, I paid $7.00."}
{"text":"Just based on a quick stop in this morning before work. XO Bisous is a very cute shop. There was a variety of pastries displayed and a lot to choose from. I was craving a chocolate or almond croissant but they only had ham and cheese or plain. I opted for a scone. They had a sweet one - apple cinnamon or savory - something and goat cheese. I decided to go for the sweet one. It came up to 3.65 or so. When I got to work and tried it out it was very good. I'm a big fan of scones and this one was nice. Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I'll have to pop by here to try other items on the menu when I'm not in a hurry!"}
{"text":"You just have to visit this place! Homemade soups and well crafted sandwiches are my favourites here."}
{"text":"Ended up here by accident. I was looking for a cafe to do a couple hours of work. Everything here is made in house. Very tempting! I had a coffee and frittata. I really appreciate a place I can grab a frittata. The owners are pleasant and put care into their business. The customers who came in seemed like regulars. I'll be back for those pastries!"}
{"text":"Stopped into this little gem on Adelaide by the corner of Church in the downtown core on my way back from their neighbours Versus.  It is a cute spot with a counter filled with sweet treats such as butter tarts, cookies, and pastries.  They also had savoury items like croissants and croissant sandwiches.  A fridge contained fresh press juices and regular pop was also available; alongside that they served Sloane tea and coffee as well.  

It is such a cute spot with it's all white interior and pink and gold accents.  Staff are friendly . Wishing the seating was more comfortable--metal stools are pretty but hardly comfortable"}
{"text":"The place is well decorated and bright. They have good options for healthy lunches. I've had a veggie sandwich and a smoothie. Both were great; ended up on $14 which is a little pricey but still good."}
