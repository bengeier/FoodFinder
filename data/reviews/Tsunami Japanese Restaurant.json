{"text":"Owned and operated by Koreans. Food is aright to the average person, bit on the high $$ side though. I'm a picky eater, so I'll have to say I can't rate them high on the taste or quality.  Service was outrageously bad though. We had a very nosy Korean Waitress, and she would interrogate my group with personal questions.  btw; this is the same nosy waitress that used to work at Mido Sushi.  Holy crud, save me from her!!! RUN."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my late night dinner at Tsunami and my sushi chef was so pleasant and conversational. I took a safe route and got one roll from their special board (a citrus concoction) and a spicy tuna roll.  The bar/wine list was limited and they had lots of umbrella pictures on the bar menu.  I would visit again."}
{"text":"It's no RA, but it's local, small and personable. I've been there multiple times and it's been great everytime. Dragon roll is great, Nancy roll and the cute fruit dessert at the end. I keep it local, and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some great sushi. Me and my buddy got the Flaming Dragon and Baked Scallops - both very excellent choices that do not disappoint. Also, their Miso soup is very underrated; one of the best parts of the meal and its free when you dine in!   Service was quick, but we were the only table there. And, the food didn't take too long to come out either.  Didn't want to knock off a star, so I'd like to say that their closed from 3 to 5, and lately I haven't been able to go as much. Hopefully it will change..."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Tsunami's sushi!  They apparently changed their name to 'MI Sushi and Teppan' very recently but nothing else seemed to change.    I have been going to this restaurant since Jan. '07 and I have never been disappointed.  The sushi is always fresh and prepared very well.  They offer many specialty rolls and each table has a picture menu and description of all of the rolls.    I really like to comfortable environment and the staff has always been very attentive and quick.  They have a couple of TVs near the sushi bar that usually have sports on but they accommodate any requests.  For those who like trying new sushi treats, try their \"mound of yummy\" salad.  It is made of layers of seaweed salad, squid salad, and fresh sashimi with a touch of sesame oil.  Brilliant!  P.S. I have never tried their teppan tables but there are usually quite a few smiling groups seated at them during the evenings."}
{"text":"If you're a sushi-lover, do not go to this restaurant - their sushi and rolls were not good. It was actually the first time in our lives when we saw a woman (I believe Korean) making sushi. Either this particular woman wasn't good or everybody at this place cooks this way. Rice for sushi was very sticky, heavy and it was put in large amounts. Each sushi piece looked almost X2 the size; fish was cut in thick pieces, so sushi didn't taste good at all. Rolls were better, but still pretty average - not worth going to this specific place. Also, though we asked & wrote down \"no cucumber\" it was in all rolls, which can be one time mistake or their regular attitude towards customers with special requests.  P.S. We went to this restaurant in August 2006 and  have never visited it again. Maybe they have a different chef now... Go check"}
{"text":"While we have never had the sushi at this restaurant, we love the Tappan.  We always get the best service and attention there, the ladies seem to love entertaining.  We have a 4 year old son, and they take him to the kitchen and give him icecream, pretty much cater to him while we enjoy our food.  We were even served cold saki complimentary one night.  My husband went there to get gift certificates for our friends for Christmas, they gave him samples of new items while he waited.  We really enjoy going and have a large group scheduled to go on Valentines Day!"}
{"text":"We had sushi there today. Nice place. Good food. Nice service. Get the Flaming Dragon Roll. It comes out on fire. They're sushi is very artsy and beautiful. I'd go again."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been  trying to find a sushi place in Chandler that measures up to Masa Sushi in Mesa! We have been to Mi Sushi a few times and the sushi is pretty good. We always get take out and this last time we were waiting and the chef sent over a plate of fruit for us! That was really nice! My only big complaint is that we will order a roll that doesn't mention anything being deep fried in the roll description(I am not into deep fried sushi) and one or two rolls always ends up having something fried in it. Not a huge deal, just a little annoying. The service was great and the atmosphere is nice. I would recommend it for sure."}
