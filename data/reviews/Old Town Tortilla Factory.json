{"text":"Go for the ambiance and not the food. I recommend only the margaritas and the kids menu. The food was virtually inedible. Mahi mahi and pork tasted like they were left out on the windowsill overnight. For a Saturday night during spring break and spring training, the Place was half filled with tourists and locals with no taste buds. Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great however, food tastes like it came from a bag or can. Not impressed. #scottsdalefoodisnogood"}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant 2 stars because the food was fairly good but the service was perhaps the worst we've ever experienced.   It was not busy when we arrived but had fiully filled in by the time we were finished, which was about 1.5 hours later. We started with the crab dip appetizer which was very good but didn't come with enough chips.  For a price of $15 we didn't feel it was unreasonable to request some additional chips when ours were gone.  The waiter finally returned with the additional chips 15 minutes later!  During this time my wife's drink needed a refill and we requested that when our chips had arrived.  The drink refill did not arrive until after our meal was delivered to the table, and even then another reminder was needed.  After we began eating our meals, the waiter never returned to see if everything was ok, or ask if we needed anything.  That too was unfortunate, because a couple of extra napkins would have been nice.  Like everything else that took place, it was an extremely lengthy process getting our bill.   I am told this restaurant provides fresh tortillas with butter when you arrive, but apparently that depends on who your waiter is, because we were never offered anything.  Overall, our waiter was just not considerate, friendly or polite and seemed as if we were a burden to him. This is the first negative review I have ever written for a restaurant, but I felt that others might want to know what they may be getting themselves into if they plan an evening here.  The food is good, although a bit pricey, but don't expect to be served in any way."}
{"text":"beautiful ambiance. Food was ok. Not much options for vegetarians which was not good. The margaritas were amazing though. Especially the strawberry margarita. It had fresh like strawberries in there. Was very empty considering it was a Saturday. We sat outside but went inside and no one was there and outside just 4 other couples and one party. Waiter was really nice too. I think food is overpriced though."}
{"text":"As I walked in, I was reading some bad reviews on my blackberry.  But the joint was jumping, there were good-looking pople all around, and I had a good recommendation.  So I took a seat next to the flaming fountain on the patio, and absorbed the cool atmosphere.

I wasn't jazzed about the menu descriptions.  They all sounded dull:  grilled sea bass topped with shrimp over garlic mashed potatoes;  Grilled salmon with an apple glaze; various enchiladas; chicken with penne pasta.  I decided that a place called the tortilla factory has got to have good tacos, so I ordered the house tacos.  How could I go wrong?

I ordered chips and salsa, and the waiter brought some complimentary black bean tortillas with tomato butter.  I wolfed down one thick, leaden, undercooked flour tortilla and pushed the plate away.  Maybe the worst tortilla I've ever had!

The house tacos were just like the fajitas from any chain restaurant:  grilled chicken, steak, and shrimp with accompaniments: guacamole, beans, rice, and pico de gallo.  Shredded iceberg lettuce was the only vegetable.

Each individual item was quite bland.  It all could have used a squirt of lime juice, some cilantro, or even just salt and pepper.  The gilled chicken was as tough as could be.  And the plain flour tortillas were nothing special.   I picked at the steak and shrimp and left the chicken.

Then I made a huge blunder and ate a second black bean burrito.  As I write this review, I can feel this baseball-sized lump of dough in my stomach.   

The atmosphere is cool, but the food stinks.  It reminded me of cafeteria food:  bland, overcooked, and not really fresh."}
{"text":"Service was great; food good! Patio awesome, sangria yea!!! They have recently been voted best in accommodating \"large groups\" but I may have to disagree on that... They don't even split checks, my biggest con. Especially since we had a party of 16, some ppl didn't even order entrees or drinks. So we split it ourselves."}
{"text":"First piece of advice: Don't order a basket of chips! They were the only part of the meal I didn't care for, and didn't even end up needing since they eventually brought out their fresh and flavored tortillas that they pair with flavored butter. The tortillas of the night were black bean flavored and were paired with chipotle butter, both of which tasted amazing! I ordered enchiladas which were good, but nothing too special. The food was overall average but I'd probably come back solely for the cool night-time environment."}
{"text":"This place should now be called Old Town Tourist Trap. 

Brought out-of-town family (seven of us) here for what we thought was going to be a nice dinner out on the patio. Ha!

Here's a summary of the evening (a Wednesday night no less!). The crowd was mostly Spring Training (baseball) fans and it was fairly busy. We had a 7 pm reservation. Table ready when we arrived. (this is the only star they get!).

The margaritas were watered down - basically glorified juice boxes. And this place is suppose to be famous for their margaritas? 

Dining Area: Too many tables crammed together, including a wait-station (extra plates, silverware, cleaning rags, napkins, pitchers of tea and etc) in the middle of the dining area. Nasty. And to top it off way too many backwaters and cleaning staff - can't tell you how many times they bumped into our chairs walking by with their buckets of dirty dishes. Management needs to streamline and reduce the number of employees on the floor. Bathrooms a mess - water all over the floor and trash overflowing.

Decor and Ambiance: Christmas lights wrapped around a dead tree that should have been removed years ago and replaced with a live tree. Leftover over Christmas ornaments are still left on the other trees. Really? In late March?!? Tables covered with vinyl. Sticky brown vinyl. Wait staff attire and look is sloppy and disheveled. 

We ordered appetizers - nothing special. Tortillas came with butter that was practically frozen. Nephew practically ate a whole basket of tortilla chips! Why? Because we waited for an hour (we watched four tables come after us and finish their dinners - two had already left) ...for our dinner to come. 

Our waitress, Samantha, was practically non-existent and spent the better part of the evening hitting on the three guys at the next table.  She should have spent the time yelling at the cooks to get our dinners out and sending the manager to us to apologize. (Side note: the table next to us (the three guys) got their dinner within 15 minutes of sitting down! Their food arrived right after ours did.)

After an hour, the food arrived - mine and my nephew's enchilada's were luke warm. I wanted to walk out at that point, but partner did not want to make a scene in front of the kids.

Not once did Samantha apologize for the el crappo service nor did she bring the manager over to apologize and maybe comp the dinner or drinks.

Bottom Line: Won't be coming here again. And I highly recommend both the locals and tourists to avoid this place."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE.  I was ecstatic to find they had a gluten free menu completely separate from their normal fare. After ordering tacos off the GF menu I knew immediately something was wrong after eating one taco. The waitress came around and I asked her the tortillas were
GF, which they weren't. She brought me GF  tortillas but it was too late. I had already thrown up in the bathroom
and was extremely sick. Also, the margaritas are NOT smooth, and the chips
and salsa are not free. If I could give a negative star review, I would. STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"If you want your young children verbally abused by staff, management and their family/friends this is the establishment to patronize. My young child luckily missed injury after a table leg broke and spilled dishes on the floor. While heading to the restroom to clean food off, she was confronted and yelled at by what turned out to be ladies related to staff and management. One lady went as far as physically shoving me while I told the group that they had no right or business to talk to my young child. The management handled the situation extremely bad when they acted to escalate the situation by confronting another person in my party instead of diffusing things and cleaning up the accident. Obviously a family operation that has lost sight of the importance of the importance of the customer."}
{"text":"This has become our regular spot when in town if for no other reason than the wonderful outdoor space.  The food has always been great - although more vegetarian options would be welcomed by the wife - and the margaritas are sublime.  Service has always been fine but we do arrive early before it gets crazy packed.  (Old people style has its benefits.)"}
{"text":"Went there Thursday for dinner with my wife. We asked for an outside seat and she said 30-35 minute wait, we said we would take an inside table. They took us to a seat that was outside as there were many empty table we said thanks. The waiter Mike came to our table and said even though you are not supposed to be seated here I will take care of you. He was rude, not our fault they sat us there. The service was terrible and the food was not good at all, a tourist restaurant. Never will go back"}
{"text":"Don't waste your precious evening......we were first to enter at 5:00 and the last to be served.  My water with a lemon squeeze was more flavorful than the margarita....no Bueno!.....decided to leave and drove down the street to Los Sombreros. Yea!, we were very pleased.  Great margarita!  The atmosphere was pleasant and quiet"}
{"text":"Initially, this place had a solid 5 stars going for it. Waited in the bar for our table and had a drink which was very good.  After a short wait, we were seated in the patio area, which has a relaxing, running water type feel going on. I dug it. We ordered a couple more drinks which came out immediately along with some chips and salsa. I must say that the salsa was incredible. At this point the dining experience was really good, but then the food came out. After taking a couple bites, we both stared at each other with a WTF kind of look on our faces. The texture of the meat just looked and tasted wrong. We pushed the plates away, ordered another round and spent the next 30 minutes debating how we thought the meat was cooked.

Aesthetically, this place is amazing! The staff was friendly and very helpful and the bar was above average for a restaurant. Unfortunatelly, for Old Town, I go to restaurants to eat, and frankly the food here sucks."}
{"text":"This place has a beautiful outdoor patio and good margaritas but the main event, the food, was very average. I was on vacation with my friends and we wanted good Mexican food. The concierge at our hotel recommended the Tortilla Factory but what a disappointment. We were looking forward to chips, salsa and guacamole to kick off our Arizona vacation, but the chips were bland, no salt, and tasted mass produced like they bought them in bulk from Costco. The guacamole was nothing to write home about. The homemade tortillas were good, not amazing. I had the red enchiladas which were satisfying but not impressive. My friend commented that the price was right, but good restaurants deliver delicious food for a fair price and I believe we should expect nothing less. It was a bummer because this place could be great if it had better food."}
{"text":"We just came back from a fabulous stay at the Hotel Valley Ho and unfortunately ate dinner at the Tortilla Factory.  I believe I have had a better meal at an airport.  The margaritas, I am sure, are made from a mix.  And they serve them in plastic martini shakers - why?  It was so bad....I didn't even finish it, and that is a first for me!
We ordered the \"chef's favorites\" whatever that means.  I knew before I ordered that the food was going to suck when a \"Southwestern\" restaurant has salmon on the menu.  And the sauce was like a sweet soy sauce.  
Bottom line, do not eat at Tortilla Factory.  It was a like an overpriced Chevy's.  At least Chevy's has free chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor patio. Fair service. Very good Margaritas if u stay away from the house margaritas. Just had the Red Snapper. Absolutely horrible! OMG. I have had so many \"Pescado Enteros\" before but this was just about as bad as it gets. Terrible spices. Over cooked. Just a mess. Admirable effort but please find a chef that has a clue!"}
{"text":"Love the food here! So great! I pick up tortilla on my way home all the time for the family! We love this place!"}
{"text":"My first experience here was 9 or 10 years ago and I tried to go back a year ago at lunch time - SOL they are not open for lunch. I was underwhelmed this time. They do have an amazing tequila selection, one of the best I've seen. The green enchiladas were good, but the menu is limited and all of the wait staff that I observed seemed to be bothered that they had to wait on customers. And $4.99 for chips and salsa at a mexican place-it's not right!"}
{"text":"Do NOT come here! The food is terrible and not worth the money. I had the \"Sea Bass\" for 29 dollars and it was absolutely inedible! It was basically beer battered fish and I highly doubt it was sea bass.! There are tons of places to go around here, don't waste your time, and certainly do not waste your money!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't get the critical reviews of this place.  Nice patio dining, chips and salsa are spot on, and green enchiladas are delicious. They serve homemade tortillas with a southwestern style spread that is a nice start to the meal.  Everyone in our party was happy with their meal."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience here last night. The out door dining area must be seen to be believed, fountains, firepits, trees! While busy with a number of groups, the service was amazing. I had Carne de Fuego which was the perfect blend of heat, sweet and smoke. My wife had Red Enchiladas and the suace has an infinite depth. Great Mexican food and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Food was good. Kid friendly too. Glad we found it while on our vacation."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  5 of us decided to try it out.  Sara said her margarita was something to yelp about, so I am.

I had the quesadilla, it was stuffed with veggies but was really messy to eat.  It kept falling apart.  Gary had the meatloaf, he dug his mashed potatoes but said the meatloaf was too spicy.   Emily had a wrap type appetizer.  She really liked hers, and had leftovers.  I never have leftovers, I have a Gary! ha!  Kathy had salad with shrimp, and she ate it all, so it must of been good. 

The cheese tortillas were fantastic! Apparently they have 12 different tortilla flavors. For dessert we had almond flan with berries, SO GOOD!  More please!  And a chocolate cake, I didn't try any of it but it disappeared so it must of been good!

The patio was nice but it's summer in Phoenix so we ate inside.  I don't know if I would go here again.  It might make it's way into my rotation.  Maybe for a drink on the patio in the winter."}
{"text":"The atmosphere outside is amazing.  Im my opinion I think the setting is half the reason to go to a place.

Not only the atmosphere, but the food here will impress as well.  Their Sonoran Meatloaf is AMAZING.  I crave this all the time, and you will too once you experience it!"}
{"text":"Ordered the enchiladas... hardly any chicken and very little flavor... and for $16!  Service was spotty as well. Will not return.   Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I have had 2 bad experiences here and both were similar. There were several open tables and we waited 30 minutes+ each time, I don't think the pretentious tone of the hostess helped our mood. The wait staff was slow on both occasions and the food was very mediocre compared to the other options of similar genre in the area (on both occasions the food was luke warm and we ordered based on the wait staffs suggestions). I have a feeling that if we had sat outside I would have had a little better experience however it would not have made up for the eh food and poor service. Good spot for drinks though if that is what you are interested in."}
{"text":"The food was ok, not very traditional. More Mexican American food. But the tortillas were really good and service was good too."}
{"text":"Great service got there when they opened and hardly anyone was there. Our server mike was really nice. Tried the margarita chicken and  I loved it. Tequila lime sauce was to die for. And the quesadillia was huuuuuge! Its a little pricey but hello your in scottsdale!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS margaritas at the bar accompanied by hot, homemade tortillas. Bartender is a pro with the large selection of tequila on hand. If you find yourself stuffed after the amazing chips & salsa, tortillas and tasty beverages...order the Old Factory Tacos - you can mix and match your favorite fillings while keeping it light!"}
{"text":"We were excited to come to this place but it turned to be disappointing. I will not be coming back. First of all they got both my wife and my orders wrong. The waitress almost never came to the table so we couldn't tell her about it. Then the food was average quality. My wife got the southwest salad and it tasted like something out of a premade salad bag with zero meat and mediocre flavoring. My green enchiladas were good but small in portion size for $15. Overpriced and not impressive."}
{"text":"I don't feel like this restaurant deserves the bad reviews it has gotten.  Or maybe we were just lucky and had a good experience.

Our friends had a deal chicken that they were using, which is the only reason we came here.  After reading the reviews on Yelp, I wasn't too excited about going, to say the least.  As others have said the decor and ambiance at the restaurant is great.  Contrary to what others have said, our service was excellent.  Our server was knowledgable and friendly and the service overall was fast and accurate.  I had the carne de fuego, and it was excellent.  The steak was cooked perfectly, and the flavors blended very well.  My wife had the mahi mahi tacos, and those were very good as well.  And I couldn't stop eating the fresh tortillas with butter.

It wasn't all great though.  Our friends got desserts, and gave us one to take home with us.  It tasted like it had been sitting around for a while, and also previously frozen.  I wouldn't recommend getting the dessert here, given the low quality of the cheesecake.  Overall, the prices aren't terrible given the quality of the food, but they're not great either.  They are a little too high.

I can't quite give Tortilla Factory 5 stars, but if you're in the area, give it a try, you might like it."}
{"text":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!!!!

Customer Service was AWEFUL, on a scale of 1-5 food was 1, drinks were ok, the only good thing was the atmosphere, which is NOT going to change my mind about going back there, I've had much much better fish tacos @ Rubio's & Baja Fresh for fraction of the price & didn't have to go to dinner somewhere else after leaving, which we had to do after leaving Tortilla Factory!

There are Plenty of Great places in Scottsdale with Great food, Great service, Great drinks & Great atmosphere.

We even tried talking to the manager but he got all Upset & tried to make us feel like we were lucky to be there & didn't know what we were talking about.

So if you want, BAD Service, Over Priced & Tasteless food & like to waste your money this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"i came here with my family for my sisters birthday. hate to say it, but the service was horrible! With a party of 8 or more horrible customer service should not be allowed a gratuity option. The food was okay, i've had way better mexican food! 
Scenery was nice we ate outside, but it took forever to just get our food. We asked our server if she can take a family picture for us, but said no she was to busy. As I watched her she was just hanging out at the bar just talking and laughing with co workers. 

I would not recommend going here for birthday dinners, scottsdale has way better mexican food in the city."}
{"text":"Samantha was super interactive sweet and we connected right away pregger to pregger! She spoiled me and my husband aha  We order the nachos for an app, simple but tasty. I got shrimp tacos. Yum! The portions are huge so you def get your $s worth...You better believe we brought home two bags of left overs. Davy got the green enchiladas they were good not great, however I highly recommend the choc cake! Mmmm the cakes kinda dense but soo good! We will for sure come back to see her."}
{"text":"I can't believe the 3 out of 5 ratings. This place rocks. 4 different meals...all boss. I promise you I have no affiliation to the place."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor ambience and good margaritas which are unnecessarily expensive. Do not waste your time eating food here unless you like Applebee's quality food at Ritz Carlton pricing. Their nachos don't have real cheese...it's the liquid version on top of grocery store bagged chips. Too many other good restaurants to go to in Scottsdale for Mexican food...give this place a pass."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2 stars because of the value. It was good Mexican but not for the prices they charge. The total for 2 entrees and a few beers was $70. I don't feel like the meal was worth any where near that. We had the pork Chile Verde and the carne de fuego. Pork Verde was very average, carne de fuego was delicious. Again, overall not a bad place, but I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"I hosted a large party of 14, employees and their kids, for a dinner at the end of a long week of business meetings. Our party was evenly split with kids and adults. We arrived at 7:45, the restaurant was very slow, but we were seated in a corner that would never have worked to seat our party. 

By 8:10, we were moved to a larger table, but some of us had to stand for 25 minutes because the place they originally sat us was so inappropriate. I feel bad for the couple sitting at a nearby two-top that had a nice view of our butts as they tried to eat. 

We had the chips and salsa, adding guacamole, and then cheese dip to keep the kids happy. The guacamole was ok for my tastes with cilantro and jalapeños in it. For out of town kids, it had too much zing for some of them. I can live with that. The cheese dip was melted white cheese (jack?) with a creamy sauce like Alfredo in it. Not at all like what I would expect. 

We ordered, and the food finally arrived around 9pm. One of my kids was studying astronomy in school and pointed out at 9:21, lights could be seen streaking across the sky. All the kids went outside to the patio to see this phenomenon, but the men stayed inside and continued their conversation. 

That's when the problem started. A busboy asked me in broken English with one hand on my plate if I was done. I said yes. My plate was whisked away. 

A few minutes later, the rest of the party returned to find all of their plates had also been taken, quite a few with significant food remaining. A pork chop with one bite out of it. A salad with a large amount remaining. A taco plate with one of two tacos eaten. 

As a former restaurant manager, I can say with authority that when an unusual amount of food is left on the plate, it's appropriate to ask: \"do you want this to go?\" \"Are they done eating?\", \"was everything ok with the food\"?, etc. it should give any restaurant worker pause to ask under those circumstances. Apparently not at the old town tortilla factory. 

When the party came back after 5 minutes, the whole table had been cleared. Children were upset, adults disappointed. My wife approached the manager and said this isn't right. He immediately blamed me for saying I was done as that was good enough to take whole meals away to the trash. My wife said they weren't done and he essentially called her a liar. He did not ask the other adults or children in our party what they were missing. He wasn't present when I said I was done with my plate. But his steadfast commitment to the position of \"too bad\" is really unacceptable. 

I am a business owner for a local business that often hosts out of town guests. Three times I have used Old Town Tortilla Factory for planned dinners for parties ranging from 40 down to 10. (Not counting this dinner). 

Reading all these negative posts have an underlying theme: management doesn't care. They don't want to create satisfied guests every time. Their inability to resolve this incident has just lost them my business, and I encourage you to try elsewhere. 

Tip to the owner, resolving this gap will net you spring training like crowds, even in the summer, instead of sparse dinner sales. Well worth the investment to hire leadership who cares."}
{"text":"When we found out that they didn't take reservations for parties of less than six, we decided to go early.

We arrived just after 5:00 and found plenty of parking.  We were greeted warmly, and immediately ushered into the dining room after being asked our seating preference.  Our server, Concetta, was efficient and friendly - explaining the Deal Chicken \"can have and can not have\"s.  There was no \"coupon vibe\" at all.

The menu is not extensive and the Deal Chicken deal eliminates most of the pricier entrees.  Still, there is plenty to choose from if you remember that you are in a Mexican restaurant.

The decor is Old Town old - comfortable, but I don't think you'd take your camera out.  The patio looked nice, but hey, it's 104 degrees out - I don't care how many misters you put out there.  And for me, misters over my food is not something I feel great about.

The Chorizo Fundido was the only appetizer available with the deal - but that's ok, it was great.  Slightly splice with lots of chorizo and peppers.  I think some reviewers may have mistaken the peppers for \"coagulated\" cheese.  We ate the entire serving.

The 4 margaritas that were part of the deal were \"OK\", not bad, not great, certainly not over proofed.  Just fine for a dinner that you might want to be able to drive afterwards without being overly concerned about being impaired. They are served in plastic shakers and they hold enough for a few \"top offs\".  They go well with the food.

Concetta was continuously monitoring our table and making sure we were ok, filling our water, asking if we were ready for more margaritas and in general looking after us.

We ordered the \"Old Town Tacos\"  and the \"Achilote Ribs\".  The tacos were, again \"OK\".  Nothing that you would urge your friends to have, but nothing you would try to dissuade them from ordering either unless they asked for your advice.

The ribs - a large portion comes with french fries and coleslaw - was again, \"OK\".  No spice on the ribs stood out.  There wasn't the heat I expected. They were just short of falling off the bone done. They had obviously cooked previously and then sauced and fired.  The hit of the plate was the coleslaw.  It had a cumin component that made it really stand out.  The french frys were wilted and soggy, but that's not uncommon when you get 'Q'.

At this point we were stuffed - and we still had two deserts to go.  Our server recommended the Banana Crisp to have there and the Flan to take home.  The Crisp is sliced bananas in a tortilla that is deep fried and then sauced with raspberry compote.  I can only say that I am not a desert person and this did not make me want to become one.  A cursory taste and we were asking for the bill and a chance to walk some of the food off.

The bill, $106.50 before Deal Chicken was $4.30 after.  We were happy to have had the opportunity to try the place for more than 50% off.  Big eaters will appreciate this place more than those with smaller appetites.

We probably won't go back for dinner, but could stop by for the Chorizo Fundido and a couple of beers."}
{"text":"Sucks. You can't even order cheese enchiladas, only chicken, which essentially means it is all pre-made.  So the chef is really just a master of the microwave. Seriously. You have to drop $5 for chips and salsa, and those aren't even good enough to be free. Avoid this place, there are tons better Mexican choices in Scottsdale, some within less than a mile."}
{"text":"The service was great, the drinks were good. We had chips and salsa and chorizo fundido. The chips and salsa were just fine. Nothing to rave about. The fundido was good, but there was no chorizo in it to be seen. I ordered the tortilla soup. Which was sort of like a bowl of enchilada sauce. I wouldn't recommend it. I had the grilled shrimp salad, it was good. My husband had the pork chili verde and it was not good. The pork was fatty and more like pork soup."}
{"text":"Love the home made tortillas but price is a little steep for the food sometimes. Still and easy 4 star rating"}
{"text":"Really good. Great service. Margaritas were awesome! Food is really good. Definitely coming back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Really really good, I ordered the \"green enchiladas\" the flavor was amazing and I also had a frozen margarita with a shot of chambord and it was just what I was looking for. The staff here is amazing and the vibe is perfect for some conversation and good laughs. I would recommend this place to anyone.

{"text":"Great place! I just went to OTTF for a first date on Friday and it was a fantastic choice.  Great outdoor ambiance with open space, ample shade, good lighting, and cooler temperatures provided by the mister system.  The food and service were top notch.  The margaritas were the best I've had.  It's not cheap, but what you get is great quality. Definitely coming back here for another special occasion."}
{"text":"15 minute wait turned into 45 minutes, one drink took 1/2 an hour then it wasn't frozen as requested, waiter was rude and said well \"you get more liquor with this type of drink\".  Really.  Now we have to wait another 1/2 hour for another drink Then no chips and salsa anymore without paying for them....really! We just had to get up and leave'"}
{"text":"This place has a great outdoor atmosphere. The food and service was very good. Enjoyed every bite of the carnitas and tostadas."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was 4 stars! Beautiful outside ambiance. Inside seemed a little crowded but felt comfortable. I did think it was very loud and continually had to talk over the other tables.
Service was 5 stars! Our waiter was very good at his job. Attentive polite and funny.
Food only 1 star. Food is where I was a little disappointed. 10$ for chips and Guac is a little much even though the Guac is fresh and delicious. I got the filet medium and it was medium well borderline well done and dry for a filet. A filet should stand alone without needing additional sauce, this one did not.
The corn on the cob I realize is grilled but it was very dry. Inedible. Potato mash was good not great. 
THE DESSERT! Wow! The chocolate cake was so good! Must try!"}
{"text":"Really great service.  For some reason our server was held up and she gave us a free appetizer.  Drinks were very good and the meal was huge.  I hadn't had a lot to eat during the day and when I got my dinner, I managed to polish it off.  The atmosphere was really good."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night. All four of us agreed it was the worst meal we have had in some time.  2 of us had Carne de Fuego. The meat tasted and looked like it had been frozen. We couldn't decide if the sauce is what tasted so bad or the meat itself. Other 2 had the chicken enchiladas, they smelled like cat food. One couldn't eat hers at all and asked to have it taken off the bill. We have NEVER done that before and we eat out together once a week! Not to mention everyone's sides were cold and the rice was hard, as in not cooked. So disappointed."}
{"text":"If you are going to Scottsdale anytime soon The Tortilla Factory is a must!!!!  The patio is amazing and they have the best Margarita's in town.  It just has a great feel and the staff is very accommodating.  I'm a monthly regular from Orange County and love to take my sales team to the Factory. They handle our relatively large group of 10-15 people with a high Quality product and a even better customer service. We can always depend on a great meal and consistency!  Whether its for work or a dinner with a loved one you will have a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"We came here over the Christmas break with family - 11 total.  The waitress was good and the margaritas were good.  However, the food was sub-standard especially given the price.  Mine was particularly bad.  I had the sea bass which was described as pan fried but came out as a grease soaked piece of fish that did not taste at all like any sea bass I have ever had.  I sent it back (which I never do) after one bite.  The waitress very nicely offered to bring me something else - the carne del fuego.  Although it was edible, it had no seasoning, the vegetables were barely cooked and the stuffed pepper was lukewarm at best.  No one at our table enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"The drinks were too weak, what is advertised as hot is not. We had the Shrimp Diablo which was bland (as were the home made tortilla). We were one drink and out.."}
{"text":"Nice patio area but the food is nothing unique and very plain.  Service was ok but I believe they can do much better with a new menu that tastes better. They are missing an opportunity since there are not that many good Mexican restaurants in the old town area."}
{"text":"Great spot. Bad service and cold food even after asking if they could please reheat 3 of the 4 meals that were served to our party of 4.  As we were walking out I thought the management would appreciate discussing my concern but the management apparently wasn't concerned enough to visit with me.  When you pay for quality service and food you should get it."}
{"text":"For a place with \"tortilla\" in the title, there really wasn't much there that required a tortilla for the eating of it.  There was meat loaf, pasta and mashed potatoes on the menu.  That's Mexican?  It was very weird.  I had  the quesadillas, which were filled with vegetables and very tasty, but they should have grilled it more since the cheese wasn't fully melted.  The portions were a good size, and flavors were good, but not fabulous.

The tortillas with butter are a bit confusing to me.  What am I supposed to do with it?  Eat it like a piece of bread?  I'm a Midwesterner, so you might have to explain it a bit to me.

Our server was fantastic (and adorable).  He checked on us just the right number of times, and was friendly without being overbearing."}
{"text":"Love the Patio, dining under the stars !!!
Super nice manager and wait staff"}
{"text":"A busy spot in Scottsdale, lots of tourists, spring training baseball fans. We had a great waitess, Jessica, which made our dining much better than others. Noticed slow service by other waiters. Food was ok, ate in the bar, beer was served warm, had to ask for ice. Probably will pass on this place for second visit."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in our experience. After waiting for an hour for a table, we were taken to the bar section of the restaurant which smelled like a fraternity basement. I was also offended to see the blue tortilla's made in an open public area by an individual not wearing gloves. Gross!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and service but the food is so bland and over priced compared to other Mexican restaurants in the area. No house chips & salsa which you will need to pay $6 for... No thanks.
Instead you will get complimentary tortillas and butter (I get it Tortilla Factory) but no. If your looking for tasty Authentic Mexican walk around the block for it literally."}
{"text":"Wow. All I can say is wow. I have lived in Scottsdale for a looooooong time and usually when I dislike a place, it's for something like customer service, or overcooking my $35 steak, or a hair in my corn chowder, but this, this was an EXPERIENCE. My best buddy moved back from San Diego this past year and it was her birthday. She loves Mexican food and I had heard about the \"great patio\" and \"delicious margaritas\" this place had. It is also next to one of my favorite hotels, the Valley Ho. Well, everything I heard about this place IS true. The margaritas WERE good (better be at over $9 a pop) and the patio is breathtakingly lovely. But OH MY GOD... the food is INEDIBLE, and when I mean INEDIBLE, I mean I swing by McDonald's on the way home for chicken nuggets. THAT inedible. The salsa was so weak I had to ask for hot sauce to basically make it go from tomato paste to some flavor. We ordered a crab dip, and it was just chunks of crab (which I was fairly confident was imitation, but mind you, I was sucking down as many margaritas as I could to mask the horrendous meal I was consuming) and avocados. I didn't even understand it. I ordered mole ribs, and the were inedible. I took two bites, and threw it away when I got to a dumpster. Normally, if it was me just dining alone, or with my fiancee, I would have wigged out, but it was a birthday, for my friend, and in all honesty, our server was top notch. She was so sweet, attentive, and wonderful, and took all of our pictures, and helped us cut the cake and everything. I would have felt bad complaining, ruining a birthday, and frankly, what would I complain about? \"Your food tastes flavorless\"? \"I have had better Mexican food at Del Taco\"? I am at a loss at how this place is still in business. It was SLAMMED when we were there. Please, if you want Mexican food in south Scottsdale, go to the Mission. I am embarrassed to say I did not check out what my fellow yelpers would have said about this place, cause I would have steered clear! Dear Tortilla Factory, go to Mexico for a while and learn what a taco tastes like, heck, just save yourself the trip and go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Went here while visiting Phoenix as it was advertised in every magazine I opened.  While this place had some delicious food, I am not a fan of pretentious Mexican food trying to be something it is not.  Also, prices were extremely high for all drinks and food.  It seemed very much like a yuppie spot for hip 20 somethings to eat outside and drink overpriced booze.  So while everything tasted great, I am not heading back here any time soon or possibly ever again as I do not live in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've been to Old Town Tortilla Factory several times and always recommend it for out of town guests because of the great patio. On my last visit, all four in my party were terribly disappointed with their dishes. There was no flavor, no spice - even though we all ordered the \"spicy\" dishes, and completely disappointing considering the high prices. The margaritas - at $12 a drink did not contain much tequila and were watered down."}
{"text":"Don't arrive too close to closing time! My wife and I have been going here for years. Not the most amazing food, but we like the location and atmosphere and we like trying to support non-chain restaurants. But that is all based on the premise of good service. 
We showed up last night 20 minutes before the posted closing time. We stated that we knew we only had twenty minutes and just wanted dessert. The hostess told us that they were having a problem with their system and could not accommodate us. I found that weird (what kind of a computer system do you need to bring out a slice of chocolate cake?), and then she added to the white lie that they had actually decided to close an hour early because of the problems with their system. At this point the restaurant is about a third full. Very confusing and maddening as we had driven very far out of our way to go there. 
Unfortunately, we will never return."}
{"text":"I bought their living social deal.  Good service, chips were stale, appetizer was lukewarm, drinks were watered down, enchiladas were ok, flan was horrible.  
If you're thinking about buying their livingsocial deal, don't bother.  It really wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"We have dined at the Old Town Tortilla Factory several times over the years and as recently as two weeks ago.  

The outdoor seating area is very nice, there is a roomy bar and fairly large indoor restaurant (I agree with Sarah K., bring a sweater).  

The Chorizo Fundido is delicious!!  They serve it with a large bowl of chips.  I always ask for a side of soft corn tortillas too, they are a nice change from the chips. 

The Plato Appertivo is gigantic, you could feed four people with this thing.  The nachos, ribs and quesadillas were all fantastic.  There is a generous scoop of their great guacamole on top and a bowl of salsa on the side.  You might want to ask for the chipotle sour cream on the side rather than on the quesadillas - it has a great smoky taste but can dominate easily so I prefer to regulate the portion.

The enchiladas and soft tacos are very good.  Their flour tortillas are great (when they bring them).

Margaritas were excellent and generous for the price.

Service can be spotty.  If you're in a rush or are frustrated by slow service to the point it impacts your food enjoyment, this place may not be your cup of tea.  I enjoy the food/drinks so I go when I know I have the time to be patient.  Test it out during a leisurely happy hour and see what you think."}
{"text":"Food is so so.. but outdoor patio is a must do it's great for a date night and to relax and have a drink. I definately would return even if just for the patio.. nice staff, quick efficient service ... and weather was amazing ...all in all a relaxing place."}
{"text":"At first we thought we were lucky to get in on a Friday night after 6. In retrospect it's understandable to see why they weren't busy and we got right in. This was to be a reunion dinner for my Mom (83 yo) and my brother and sister and law visiting from CA, and my wife - and it was my decision to go here. What a mistake. 

The reception was impersonal and she tried to put us in a dark corner inside. I pointed out two tables by the fireplace and was told that those table were for parties of eight and we were only five. Except for one other couple - we were the only ones in the room! Wife and I went to the two tables - put them together and we sat down. 

OK - fast facts - I was told no beer on draft only bottles - so I ordered DXX amber - a bottle of DXX (no amber) arrived with lime sticking out of top. No glass at these prices? Wife had Margarita (rocks no salt) - came with salt and tiny glass with refill. Tasted like crap so she switched to Cabernet. So much for the beginning of Mexican food experience. 

My Pork Chili Verde was tough with gristle running through it. Tasted boiled and sauce ladled over it. Pure garbage. I returned it and ordered the chicken pasta. More garbage. Cold, no flavor, runny cheese sauce and hardly any chicken. My Mom had the same dish and ate without complaint - I was embarrassed for her - she was just happy to be with the kids.

Wife had fish tacos. Terrible - no flavor, cold. I didn't find out until this morning that she hated them. 

The tortillas they brag about were cold and tasteless. The chips were stale. The guacamole dip was OK if you like only mashed avocado - I've had better at Taco Bell.

Our server was attentive and did the best she could - she took over after the first gal that took drink orders then disappeared. No complaints with her service but reception and the first server were inattentive and poorly trained. 

Funny, even after the returned food - we never heard from the manager or anyone. This place is horrible - go somewhere else. I'll never return.

I don't understand the 4 star ratings unless management has insiders writing glowing reports."}
{"text":"I love the outdoor ambiance but I have to be honest the food and drinks are awful.  The margaritas taste like a whole lot of water and no alcohol.  Their sweet and sour mix taste like Sprite.  I am so surprised as to how this establishment in a nice area can offer such bad food.  
The chips are out of a bag.  They are the low fat kind you buy from the grocery store.  Oh and you have to pay almost $5 for chips and salsa.  They use to serve a fresh flour tortilla and butter but thats no longer an option anymore.  I waited over 40 minutes for my entree.  By the time it came to my table I realized the wait staff forgot it.  The only saving grace was the sweet waiter.  This place is a major tourist trap and they apparently can get away with charging people over-priced dishes and watered down drinks because of their location.  Do yourself a favor and skip on this restaurant.  I promise you will enjoy a better meal at Rubios or Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place out with the wife for a friends birthday dinner. Atmosphere was great even for June on the patio. They had black bean tortillas and whipped butter on the tables that was delicious. Margaritas were good and that would probably wrap up all the good. 

Now the ugly, we were with a large party that showed up in groups. Which most service people would assume separate checks or at least ask. This wasn't a concern until the end of the evening, when our server presented 1 check and expressed dismay along with words of discouragement that it would take a while to split, very unprofessional for an upscale Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. I believe that the management at this establishment is non existent. Servers seem to do as they please, reach over guests, place plates in front of incorrect guests. Many of the simple things that management would typically ensure that there staff is engaged in doing correctly. 

Now the food. Carne y Camerones (steak and shrimp) great ingredients but poor execution. The steak was overcooked as well as the shrimp and served cold. The mashed potatoes were tasty but dry and cold as well. I feel that the cooks had their timing off, maybe because of the large party or just the fact that they didn't care. The technique and the ingredients were there for a great meal but it felt thrown together and was served cold. 

This restaurant could be great, they have a good menu, good drinks, great atmosphere, but the service, execution, professionalism, and passion is not there. I blame the management."}
{"text":"Perfect outdoor dining.  We found this place on a brochure and we are sold right away.  The set up was impressive as you walked in.  But was not impress with the food.  I had the pork chile verde and it was salty.  Although I have to say on a nice evening it's a  place to relax."}
{"text":"First of all a Mexican restaurant that you have to pay for chips and salsa should've been my first indication. Second when you can't order a cheese and bean burrito that should've been another red flag. And you can't have anything all a cart I should've got up and walked out. Don't order the house margaritas they taste like they made them with club soda, worst margarita I've ever had in my 54 years. Four people my bill was $120 for Mexican food outrages.......  I will never go back I do not recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"While I enjoyed the food (shrimp tacos), I was utterly disappointed in the service. I went last night for dinner and was surprised at the very long wait for a) my drink order, b) my food order, and c) the check. We were some of the last people to leave (it was still early!) and you could tell the staff was supremely annoyed with our presence. Dirty looks from at least 4 people. If I return, I think I might go during the day."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh..  This restaurant is amazing.  Love the patio and the atmosphere of the restaurant.  The blue corn tortillas are totally yum.  (Mouthwatering just thinking about it.).  They have great margaritas and menu. 

If you have not been here, go like NOW!!! If you are ever in the Phoenix area, you need to try this place out.

It is a casual place with a higher end price (otherwise if you are on a limited budget, this is a special occasion place)."}
{"text":"Foodies, stay away, save your money and dine elsewhere!!!

I only gave this restaurant one star because of the ambience. Aside from that the restaurant suffers from an identity crisis, the cuisine is neither Tex-Mex nor good. 

I have been coming to this restaurant three years in a row, and sadly the food has declined year over year. To begin with, I ordered a margarita, that was awful! That should have been my first clue. The second one was just as bad. Disappointed and not wanting to try a third time, the Coke I resorted to didn't have enough syrup. The meet for the tacos was dry and the shrimp was frozen and over cooked. One of them tasted like it was past its expiration and smelled fishy. The tortillas stuck together and had been sitting under a warming lamp for a long time. Given the name is the Tortilla Factory, they should take pride in these, however only the appetizer tortillas are made in house. The others are purchased elsewhere. Meal was grossly overpriced and awful!"}
{"text":"My experience at Old Town Tortilla Factory is probably very different than that of the average patron. I dined here with a semi-private party with 40 other guests and we were served buffet-style.

Our group was seated in their outdoor dining area, which I absolutely loved. I thought the atmosphere was great and brought an authentic Southwest feel and vibe to the restaurant. The food was as decent as you would expect sharing buffet-style with 40 other people lined up outdoors: nothing mind-blowingly memorable, but nothing too bad, either.

My one complaint would be the servers. Especially at our single table of 8, it did not seem the server we were assigned was equipped to take care of a large group. There was much unnecessary confusion at the end of the night when it came down to settling some bar tabs. Overall, it did not ruin our experience, but definitely took away from the overall positivity. 

Regardless, I would love to come back here with a smaller group and enjoy a fresh plate of food! The outdoor dining is definitely something you can't pass up..."}
{"text":"Fun place for good margaritas, enchiladas and more.  Very nice patio and hand made tortillas.  Service was very good and we will return soon."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to the \"Award Winning\" Old Tortilla Factory having very high hopes for the Mexican food - we're from New Mexico and like hot & spicy.  I thought the courtyard was nice if a little run down (could use a re-fresh).  We  had good service until we were ready for our check - it had gotten busy so we had to flag down our waiter.  The food was just mediocre; not enough spice and flavor.  My daughter had a gargantuan plate of nachos that were just mediocre, nothing special.  I had the shrimp tacos that were flavorless, the corn tortillas were like cardboard and there was no white creamy sauce that's usually served on tacos - rather disappointing.  The best thing we ate were black bean tortillas and herb butter that were not even part of the menu and served as a pre-meal bread.  I wish I had eaten only the black bean tortillas and butter!  This looks like a place that had its' hey-day once and now are just old and tired of it all.  I think it could be brought back with new menus, some bright updated decor, and new management/owners.  We don't have to try this place again; I'm pretty sure the people that really like this place have had a few margaritas before dinner."}
{"text":"awesome time, drinks ,food. Ask for Emily, she was attentive and courteous. Im from San Diego just visiting AZ and I would definitely recommend this to anyone! We ordered a shrimp dish and hubby ordered the meatloaf , all very delicious. Specially the tortillas they served us as soon as we sat down! Try the margaritas!! Just awesome! Cute lighting decor and heated outdoor seating!
oh and dont forget to order the banana dessert with blackberries!!so good!"}
{"text":"Last weekend I had the opportunity to go the Old Town Tortilla Factory in Phoenix. When we got there I was amazed by the under-the-stars seating and the authentic Spanish arch entrance made me feel like I was walking deep into the heart of Mexico.    
     The Hostess greeted us with friendly brown eyes but ripped our hearts out when she told us that it would be an hour wait. Thinking it would be worth it, we decided to wait on it and even run some errands in the mean time. 
     When we got back our table was ready and we were seated right away. We were treated to delicious chips and salsa and I must've had at least three bowls by myself. Our waitress was super friendly and made sure we were 100% satisfied. I ordered the Gaucho Burrito and it was everything I could've ever imagined. It was smothered in hatch Chile peppers and my mouth was on fire by the time I was finished. When we got the check my parents seemed to be satisfied even though we didn't leave much of a tip. 
     In Conclusion, I thought it was a memorable Mexican experience. Every now and then I had to remind myself that I was still in the states. The best part was that I couldn't finish my burrito so I got to eat it again for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the Old Town Tortilla Factory, and it will likely be my last. I'll break my experience down this way:

Food - If I wrote that the food was mediocre, I would be charitable. The queso fundido came out with a texture more like soup than melted cheese. The flavor was not too bad, but the texture was too hard to get past. It was served with in-house flour tortillas, which were nice, but the corn chips that were also served were commercial, mass produced corn chips. You would think that a place that calls itself a \"Tortilla Factory\" would have made their corn chips in house. It's easy to do and would have made a huge difference.

I also order the chicken tortilla soup. It is a chile-based soup with an odd, thick texture to it, as if somebody went a little overboard with the corn starch. I can't say it was as think as Jello, but it did jiggle! It had very little flavor. I would not order it again.

Service - Our server was very pushy, insisting that she new more about what we should order than we did. As this was a birthday celebration, I wanted to buy the guest of honor a \"Millionaire Margarita\"; it's an expensive cocktail but it would show some generosity to the birthday girl and perhaps make her feel a little special. Our server, however, immediately discouraged that order and suggested a different drink. Opportunity robbed. 

Drinks - Here's where the Old Town Tortilla Factory shines. I tried several different drinks and I loved every one of them. Tasty, well made, and generous quantities. Here's the only part of the Tortilla Factory that would entice me to return. Kudos to the bartender!"}
{"text":"I would not consider this Mexican food but they sure do make a delicious tortilla and a yummy margarita that comes with a shaker to top off your glass throughout your meal.
I sat on the patio on a normal 108 degree July evening in Phoenix and even the misters were not strong enough to battle the heat.  My skin kept sticking to the cheap plastic patio furniture when I would try to move.  The ambiance made up for all of that.
It took a while for the server to come over and take a drink order but I was given an extra large glass of water as soon as I was seated so at least I stayed hydrated while waiting for my Mrs. Sames Original Margarita.  I ordered the Old Town Tacos w/o shrimp.  Took a while for it to come out and they don't bring out complimentary chips/salsa ($4.99 on the apps menu) so my Margie kept me company.
The plate finally came out piled high with steak, chicken, black beans, rice, lettuce, pico de gallo and guacamole.  They also bring out flavored tortillas and butter with the meal which they say is their version of bread and butter - could have used them around the same time an Italian restaurant serves their bread and butter.  Anywho, tonight's flavor was cheddar cheese tortilla with a sour cream and chive butter.  They were really good.  As for the taco plate, the steak was good but too smokey flavored to eat on its own.  It was just right when wrapped up in a tortilla with all the other fixin's.
For dessert, I had the banana crisp with blackberry compote.  It was good but nothing to write home about. The cinnamon covered tortilla that the bananas were wrapped in could have been crispier and the blackberry compote did not have enough flavor.  The compote would have also been better if it had been served warm.  The whole thing was just too mushy for me.  The one thing they got right with this dish was the presentation. It was so pretty that I took a picture before I took a bite.
One more thing they could improve on - the music.  It was a step up from elevator music.  Not what I want to hear at a dinner table.
The end."}
{"text":"So I'm not usually one to negatively review restaurants as I know each diner has their own palate and desires but I feel this one needs a little forewarning to out of towners looking for a great Mexican meal. We were in town for Spring Training and saw advertisements in nearly every publication for this spot and it appeared like a very cool, relaxed, romantic outdoor environment so we said let's do it!

Upon arrival the outside decor looked amazing and like the perfect dining spot for a great meal, drinks, and conversation after a couple of hot days watching baseball. To our dismay the wait for the outdoor courtyard/patio was an hour and a half (understandable though on a Saturday night. So we decided on the 45 min wait for inside and headed to the bar/cocktail area. After waiting nearly 10 min at a cocktail table we were finally addressed and were able to order chips, salsa, and guacamole and two of what were plastered over all their advertisements as \"Arizona's Best Margarita\". The chips and salsa and guacamole were fantastic!!! The margaritas, although accompanied by their own plastic shaker with refills in it, left far more to be desired. Very sweet, no sense of alcohol in it, and on the watered down side... Suppose we should've heeded the other reviews on here about them. Finally our table was ready and I had to chase down our cocktail server to tab out for about 5 minutes since the bartender was unable to assist us with paying as he appeared far less busy than our cocktailer. 

Our table was nice, the server very friendly, and we selected a few apps to share since we had filled up on the tasty chips and salsa. The water had a funky taste to it so we passed on that. Chicken quesadilla was okay but I've had better. The Spicy Shrimp Diablo clearly was a lost dish on this menu... Embedded with sundried tomatoes mushrooms and garlic, no heat or sense of spice or Mexican cuisine, it clearly felt like it belonged in an Italian restaurant - the shrimp were cooked perfectly though! 

Did see kitchen staff nearly run over three guests as the restrooms are in the same location as the kitchen exit and I'm sure there's numerous instances where collisions and food spills happen because the staff is rushing out without regard for patrons. I guess the woman's restroom is very small and difficult to maneuver around - and my friend is very petite!

Overall I'm sure there are probably really delicious dishes on the menu based on the number of clientele dining but we were left with far more to be desired from this experience. Just a warning for those of you looking for a great Mexican meal."}
{"text":"Nice patio with white lights strung overhead.  Nice hostess and waiter, andres, was great.  Mexican food is our favorite, but the flavor was lacking.  Actually had to ask for some salt from the hostess for my Mahi mahi tacos."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance,  but food was not bad nor good. Tortilla soup was more in the tomato-based side. Seemed like the mac n cheese the kids ordered was cold. Our food was served in good portions yet the tortillas were hard and not soft like we thought they should be. To me the food was waiting a long time to be served. Disappointed; with so many choices around us, we picked the restaurant with the catchy name. Well they sure caught us."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday evening and there was no crowd. We sat outside, and although it was 90°, the restaurant has misters running and was nice and cool. We had chips and salsa, and I had the chicken margarita. The chips were fresh and tasted good. The salsa was fresh, crispy, and great tasting, slightly spicy with no bad aftertaste.  The chicken, potatoes, and vegetables were all cooked perfectly. The chicken was stuffed with peppers but was not too spicy. The overall cost for three people was $93. It was not outrageous and I were definitely recommend another trip there."}
{"text":"I am also surprised at the not too good reviews, I was pleasantly surprised to find an absolutely charming large and inviting patio.  The wait was not too bad for a Saturday night (20 minutes), and the margaritas were quite good (though not on the cheap side).  I love how they have different and very unique flavored hand made tortillas, and oh man, the guacamole? YUMMM! We all went with the steak tacos, and they were really good, loved the marinade they use for the steak. The only downfall I would say was the limited parking but other than that, I am a fan!"}
{"text":"This was such a disappointment. Four of us went to dinner last night (Tuesday December 4, 2017). The chips tasted like store bought stale chips, the salsa was bland. Three of us ordered tacos and one ordered green Chile pork. The green Chile pork was a bowl of watery soup with a tiny bit of finely shredded pork and a whole bunch of potatoes! The tortillas served on the side tasted homemade but the tortillas that came with the taco meals were dollar store tortillas. The meat was good--chicken, shrimp and beef, but no cheese with the tacos, only black beans and rice. The guacamole we ordered was ok but it was $13. Two at our table had beer, one had a glass of wine and I had a soft drink. The bill was a total shock. $114 for four awful meals. The service was poor too. Nice but not at all attentive. We all could have had a far tastier meal at any other Mexican restaurant for a fraction of the price. I guess they are really proud of their ambience."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant, but below average food. I was surprised they didn't offer offer one vegetarian entree on the menu, as most restaurants now do.  Tortillas were cold and tough to chew, the taco meat entree that came with rice and beans included, that I requested a vegetarian substitute, did not come with rice, which is beyond me in terms of reasoning.  I had even asked when i was ordering to make sure rice was included.  Fiancé had the carne de fuego, which did not have any sides or tortillas with it, which we would have expected. Below average service, took 10 minutes of waiting after we were done before any one noticed to take our plates away.  Its a damn shame we had such a bad experience, as it is a nice looking property and we were thinking of possibly having our rehearsal dinner here.  Unfortunately, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I actually thought the food was OK and had the service been ok, I would have given this three stars.  However, the service was just short of horrendous.   The server disappeared for long periods of time, then came back and forgot multiple items we had asked for.   We felt like we were putting him out just asking for refills.   I would say there is a systemic issue with this place.  It is crying out for some basic server training and management."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here on Saturday night, not only did we have the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant, on an extremely slow night, the manager and a bachelorette party sitting next to us ended up getting into to a physical and screaming fight next to us where the MANAGER began to cuss out the women, after their servers messed up on all of their tickets. I love the overall look of the place but will not be going back for a long time, hopefully they hire new Managment and servers soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here with our best friends expecting to eat some of the best homemade tortillas we had ever eaten. Although the tortillas were very unique (I have never had flavored tortillas before) they fell short of our expectations. Our server, Mina, was great and she did a fantastic job and was very attentive to our needs. The margaritas were good and I really liked the tortilla soup and chicken salad I ordered. My friend ordered the diablo shrimp and she said it was just ok. My wife ordered the shrimp cocktail and, again, it was just ok. Finally, my buddy ordered the Maui tacos and he said they were average. I don't know what else to say except we were really expecting the food to be better than ok. 
The best thing about our experience was the service that Mina, our server, provided. And the patio was really nice but it was too hot to eat outside. 
I asked everybody in my group if any of them would eat here again and sadly each one of them said no."}
{"text":"If I had to break down our experience,  it would be: 4 Star Ambiance, 3 Star Food, and 2.5 Star Prices. My Carne de Fuego was pretty good but my wife wasn't impressed with her Flautas con Mole; my meal was $16 and her meal was $10. I've paid less money for better tasting food, but the meals were not bad at all. They also served black bean tortillas with cheese flavored butter which was Delicious.  Outdoor seating was quite pleasant but I wish the staff would've been more proactive in turning on the heaters as it was chilly outside (we asked at the beginning of our visit but they forgot about it until we tried to turn the heaters on by ourselves).
In summation, the experience was visually pleasing but there was still room for satisfaction in the taste and wallet region. This place is an \"okay\" choice for a night out."}
{"text":"So I have completely been MIA lately! It makes me sad, and I realized that I haven't not been going to as many new places or seeing new sites without Yelp's guidance! So this is my return.

Old Town Tortilla Factory was a-ok in my books! I had the enchilada and it was truly delicious. It was almost tex-mex and not truly a \"mexican\" enchilda, but it was still tasty! The sauce had just the right amount of kick, the tortilla appetizer was delicious, and our server was friendly and gave us space. I'd definitely recommend it as long as you keep in mind that it's not TRULY mexican food...

The only thing I would change? It was cold and windy and the heater wasn't close enough to our table to really warm things up ... but if that's my only complaint it wasn't too shabby. :)"}
{"text":"Last week I bought a deal on Living Social. It included an appetizer to share, two entrees, and a dessert to share. Oh, and four margaritas. It was a good deal, needless to say. We decided to redeem our voucher on a Friday night. I called to make a reservation, and was told they don't make reservations for parties less than 6, but to come in and they would seat us. No big deal. We got there a little after 8.

We asked for a table outside, sat down, and I ran to the restroom. By the time I got back, we still didn't have a server. We sat there for nearly 10 minutes before I was going to say something. Then, finally,our server came over. He was nice, and took our drink order. I told him about the Living Social, and all night he proved to know little about it. He even mentioned that this was his first one. That's fine, the voucher hadn't been out long... But if an establishment is going to run a deal like that, the entire staff needs to be aware of it before greeting tables. As you can see in other reviews here on Yelp and other networks, the voucher has been redeemed several times already.

We ordered our first round of margaritas. Sheryl asked for frozen. When he came back, hers was not frozen. Our server corrected the issue, but why would he bring a drink that was not what she ordered all the way from the bar? Then we ordered our enchiladas. We asked for both with no sour cream. When they arrived at the table, both had sour cream on top. You can see where I am going with this.

Once my entree hit the table, I asked if they had any hot sauce. \"Yes, we have a nice habenero hot sauce.\" I asked for some... Never came to the table. It was literally one thing after another all night long. By the end of the night, I needed to inform a manager of our experience. I did, and she offered us a round of drinks. We had already consumed two margaritas each, and didn't want another one. Then she offered us a dessert. That was included in our voucher. Again, she was nice, and I didn't ask for anything... Just wanted her to be aware.

A few minutes later, the server grabbed our dishes to box up... We only ate about half. There was a lot of food! He then came back, and we asked for the check. He made a snide comment about the experience not being \"up to standard,\" which it wasn't, and walked away. Why would the manager mention that to him while we were still in the restaurant?

We left happy with the food... But the experience was the worst I had seen at the Old Town Tortilla Factory. I remember the first time I visited the Tortilla Factory. Such great memories of sitting outside under the stars eating delicious authentic Mexican fare. I once would recommend people visit the Tortilla Factory, but with the recent experience we had, am not sure I can recommend it again. The food was awesome... Always is. But the service needs work. Hopefully the next item I go everything runs smoothly."}
{"text":"We went here last night with a large group. The place is so interesting. Honestly, the food was wonderful but what made the difference was our wonderful waiter. He was welcoming, funny, kept great tabs on us. I would go there again just for the service!"}
{"text":"I was forced to even give this 1 star to post a review. We were seated right away but that is the only positive. Food was over priced, terrible and it took over an hour. No flavor, extremely bland. Service was terrible. I went inside to the bar for drink refills, salt and pepper. I still could not find anyone so I went back to the hostess to get service. Horrible first time experience, we will never go back.....EVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"Three of us went here on a nice warm winter evening. The patio was great but the food was poor. My wife had the tacos which were only mediocre. My sister had the red enchiladas and they were poor. I had the steak fuerte. Again very plain. Even the margaritas were the worst I have ever had!  I think they were made with Sprite and very little tequila. We expected better in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I brought family from out of town here.  They enjoyed it, and the ambiance of the outdoor patio was just what I was looking for.  The service was also great.  But unfortunately, the food was just OK.  Everything needed salt or seasoning of some sort, it was rather bland.  We started with the guacamole.  Nothing special there.  The sea bass was supposed to be topped with a jalapeno hollaise sauce, but there was so little of it that I could not even taste it.  The red enchiladas were very bland.  The meatloaf was pretty good after adding salt.  The best out of what we ordered was the penne con pollo.  The balsamic reduction was very good and really made the dish.  I would probably not come back though since the majority of our meals were not great."}
{"text":"Dined here tonight. Won't be back. The good: nice ambiance. That's about it.
The average: (nothing really terrible here, just average all around) 
Chips and salsa: $6.00 really? Complimentary at nearly every other Mexican restaurant. 
We did get complimentary tortillas and chipotle butter. Now for a place named \"Tortilla factory\" these should be nothing short of stellar. Ours were undercooked and very doughy tasting, although the butter was nice. Randombertos tortillas are much better. No fajitas, burritos, chimichangas in the menu. I had the chef recommended green enchiladas with chicken. These were the most boring I've had in a long time. Rice and beans were plain and bland, enchiladas were mediocre, at a high $16.00. Overpriced, unimaginative menu, slow service, and poorly prepared."}
{"text":"If you are from TX steer clear of this place.  This is no where near TexMex.  The tortillas, \"queso\" and \"salsa\" will make you cry and want to grab the first flight back to Texas.   

I had the mahi tacos and they had no flavor and the corn tortillas were tough as leather.

Why did I give them 3 stars you ask?   Because I'm biased.  Maybe to everyone in AZ this is top notch Mexican food.....and my waitress was very nice.

Sadly I'm a bigger fan of Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Great ambiance!!! So beautiful to eat outdoors on the string lit patio! Food is yummy! Jalapeño butter with homemade tortillas is to die for! Love their build your own tacos plate! Little pricy! But def a nice place for special occasion or treat-yo-self occasion."}
{"text":"Old Town Tortilla Factory's patio and outdoor ambiance is beautifully romantic. On a perfect Arizona evening in the spring or fall, it's an excellent spot to enjoy the comfortable climate. One star awarded. 

But if you do anything besides sit on the patio, you will be disappointed. Four stars deducted.   

Our server took our order after we had been seated for about 10-15 minutes. Then it was like she completely forgot that she had to actually bring us our margaritas and food. Total space cadet. We asked for things, like waters, that never came. 

Call me crazy, as most people do, but I was also highly irritated by the fact that the chips and salsa here are not complimentary. That's something I expect from a Mexican dining destination. For the top shelf pricing, they could at least throw in a measly chip and salsa bowl on the house. Yeah, their tortillas with cubes of butter are supposed to replace the chips and salsa...... but tortillas and butter? Methinks not. Methinks that I'd much rather have chips and salsa!

The food is mild to bland, yet it costs a pretty peso. I ordered the \"El Tesoro Del Mar\" - a salad (consisting of mostly iceberg lettuce ick), spicy honey chipotle dressing (waaaaay too sugary with too little spice), pico de gallo, corn, black beans, tortilla strips and large gulf shrimp (only 4 shrimp!! and they were hardly large, more like small to medium sized!!). This disappointment of a dish cost about $15. Overrated. I can honestly say I've had a much tastier shrimp salad at Baja Fresh, for half the price and double the shrimp nonetheless. 

I tired some of the enchiladas that Matt ordered, and they tasted forgettable at best. I've had better enchilada sauce from a store bought can. And then my mother, who was in town visiting for the weekend, ordered the grilled salmon. She was so unimpressed by the meal that she didn't even finish it... and she always finishes her food. It takes a lot of skill to mess up something like a grilled salmon. 

As far as their margaritas go, they are good but with the $8.50 to $11 price tag I'm just not convinced that they are worth it. I've had better margaritas at places with better menus. I can honestly say that after eating here once, I have ZERO desire to ever go back."}
{"text":"The outside patio at OTTF is beautiful. At night it's all lite up and if you go in Spring, the weather is perfect. We had a large group there last Saturday and they accommodated us well. Food was out in a timely manner and the server was friendly. 

Sadly, the food was not impressive. The Old Town Tacos were pretty basic and the margarita I ordered was watered down. The chorizo fundido was a good app. But I would need to revisit and try other menu items, before I could give this restaurant a rating higher than a 3."}
{"text":"My mouth is watering just thinking of the fluffy floured freshly made tortillas.  The tortillas along with their cilantro butter are nothing short of amazing. And they should be.  I mean, it IS called the Old Town Tortilla Factory, so they had better be delicious.  

Other than that and the expansive twinkle-lit patio, there's nothing to really write home about here.  I found myself here twice in the past week so I was able to enjoy some great patio dining.

It seems like every Mexican/ Southwestern restaurant says they have the best margarita in Arizona.  OTTF makes that claim on the back side of their menu, along with a litany of other awards mostly from Citysearch.  City what?  City who?  The award-winning Treasure margarita looked impressive and robust presented with the shaker - providing an extra drink or so.  The taste was not anything out of this world like I expected.

The patio is really huge and makes up probably 70 percent of all the seating in the establishment abutting the quaint historic adobe home - meaning fall and spring are definitely the times to go here.  But the green plastic chairs - gahh!  A charming and impressive patio is diminished by the cheap picnic ambiance the chairs emit.

The food is ok.  The first time I had the Poblano de Mariscos -- stuffed poblano peppers filled with crab, cream cheese, herbed butter, roasted corn, diced red bell peppers with a shrimp cream sauce. The reality?  Stuffed peppers with mostly cream cheese and a smattering of crab flakes.  I couldn't even taste the crab.  The second time I ordered the tortilla soup and it wasn't all that great either.  It was more red than orange and had more chicken and not enough tortilla than I have had elsewhere.  It's ok if that the way you like it, but I will pass.  

The salsa was the worst though.  Mostly a red tomato sauce with bit of chile included.  It was the most mild and un-spicy salsa I have EVER had in my life.  I think Pace mild sauce is hotter than this stuff. Since I was with my friend Maya and a friend visiting from Queens, I was shouting \"New York City?!\" - mocking the old Pace commercials.  Maybe they accidentally served us Ragu.  Who knows? All was fine once we asked for habanero sauce to spice it up. 

2.5 stars overall. 5 stars for the tortillas."}
{"text":"I don't get all the bad reviews.

I popped in for dinner last night. Saturday. 7pmish. Yes, it was busy, and the wait was about 90 mins or so.

Our party went over to the bar and promptly sat down. This is where things could have become a bit of an issue. It was a bit of a clusterfuck in there. No servers, one bartender. We had no idea what we were supposed to do.

Wait at the table? Go to the bar and place an order?

Eventually, we were able to order our food and drinks. We summoned someone to come over and the service ended up being great from there. 

We received our drinks and appetizer in a flash. We ordered the crab dip. It was tasty, but a little bland. Perhaps it needed salt....but it definitely needed a kick. Make sure to ask for a few hot sauces (cholula at a minimum). Also be sure to ask for chips and salsa. It seems like this is by request only.

The crab dip came with just six chips. Kind of sad. Oh well.

Like I said though....the speed of service and general attitude whenever we needed refills and whatnot was good. This made up for the potentially disastrous start to the evening.

We were eventually seated at our table in the patio. Oh yeah. Don't ever come to this place and sit inside. It's a waste. Trust me....I am usually the kind of guy that prefers sitting inside.

The patio is dimly lit, is very romantical. Perfect for a date....if you are brave enough to take a date to a mexican place.

Service was no issue from here on out. So if you read all the other reviews and see notes on bad service....you heard it from me. Mr. Elite Yelper. The service was great.

While the server took our order, she brought out red pepper tortillas with garlic butter. Nom.

I ordered the Carne De Fuego. Tender pieces of steak in a honey chipotle sauce, with peppers, onions. Garnished with a green chile pepper that was stuffed with a mashed sweet potato.

The food was VERY good. Everyone seemed to really enjoy their meal. I heard no complaints.

Also, our server was pretty friendly. Made good conversation and even took our photo at the end of it all. 

A great night, with great food, but most importantly....great company. 

Bring your friends. Bring your lady. Bring your man. Bring someone. It's worth sharing."}
{"text":"The best restaurant patio I've been on in Scottsdale.  I've been here twice ... the customer service is great, the food and drinks are great, but the ambiance is the best around."}
{"text":"Had a deal chicken for this place and heard it was fabulous so I spent $49 on a deal chicken...I was really very very very disappointed with this place.

The service was awful, which should have been my first sign.  The food, especially one that is promoting a \"tortilla factory\" was bland and really nothing special.  

The chips were cold, the chorizo queso was coagulated and our meal wasn't anything you couldn't get at a mexican restaurant for half the price and double the flavor. 

The margaritas were watered down.  

The best part, dessert.  The chocolate cake and the cheesecake are both pretty damn good, hence the 2 star.

Oh, and parking sucks too."}
{"text":"First night in town and we decided on Mexican food. This place was recommended by the concierge thus we tried it. The outdoor dining area is terrific but was awfully dark making reading the menu difficult. The menu items were more of an \"upscale\" selection. Our dinners were fantastic, but I would prefer some more traditional choices, as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely GROSS!!!!
Ordered Sea bass, was a cheap frozen piece of fish in batter, disgusting, didn't eat it!

My boyfriend ordered the ribs, fowl!! Over cooked with congealed disgusting sauce & soggy fries.... YUCK YUCK YUCK!!!!!!

Do not recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here while on vacation. The atmosphere on the outside patio can't be beat. I live the lights and the tall trees. My husband ordered a specialty margarita and enjoyed it. I am a very big fan of the warm tortillas and butter they serve before dinner. We both enjoyed our meals. I had the verde enchiladas which were advertised as spicy. I did not find them spicy but I can tolerate a lot of heat."}
{"text":"I pretty much agree with the lukewarm reviews.  This is another case of style over substance.  Old Town Tortilla Factory is to Sonoran what Sassi is to Italian, except where Sassi gets 5 stars for ambiance and 3.5 stars for food and to me is worth the price, OTTF gets  3.5 stars for ambiance and 2 stars for food and isn't worth the price.  So I think I'm being generous with the 3 star rating.  After reading the yelp reviews I made sure to not get my hopes up, but before leaving Boston my co-workers gave me a gift card here so I had to give it a shot. 
 
On to my particular experience. . .
 
The outdoor seating is very nice, but I wish the chairs weren't plastic.  Plastic works at brunch on a farm, not dinner in Scottsdale.  And I still can't believe how many heaters they had going at full blast, it was a calm 62 degrees when I was there.  If you get cold, throw on an alcohol jacket. 
 
Which is what my husband and I proceeded to do.  He had the Treasure Margarita - at first he balked at $11.25 but they give you a shaker to pour it yourself so it comes out to be like 1.5 - 1.75 drinks.  He liked it very much, but laughed when I had said another reviewer had called them \"sublime\".  I had a sauvingon blanc which had a funny taste to it.  Meh. 
 
Instead of bread and butter, there gimmick is, as you would guess, fresh house made tortillas.  When the waitress brought ours out she remarked that the spread was a cilantro butter, then proceeded to open the tortilla holder and said, \"Oh, and the tortillas are cilantro flavored. . .they make new flavors all the time so I guess this batch was cilantro. . .\"  Quick hint to OTTF - if you're serving cilantro butter, skip the cilantro flavored tortillas.  The tortillas were very good no doubt sans extra cilantro flavored butter. 
 
We started with the Chorizo Fundido which was nothing special.  It was a bit too creamy (think sour cream) and not cheesey enough, certainly not the Queso Guillermo at El Encanto which is a bowl of melted cheesey goodness. 
 
Since I'm sort of a wimp when it comes to spice, and considering nearly every dish is marked with a \"spicy\" chili logo, I asked the waitress how spicy the Chicken Calabacitas were.  She said that they are very safe with their \"spicy\" designation and none of the dishes have overpowering spice.  \"It's not like you'd need a sip of water after every bite.\"  I trusted her unfortunately, and was disappointed that I needed a sip of water after every 2 bites.  Besides the spice, the dish was good and bountiful.  My husband ordered the Pork Chile Verde and was disappointed at how tough and chewy it was. 
 
The highlight of the meal was when we paid with the $75 gift card for the $67 meal (being so underwhelmed, we were willing to forfeit the additional $8 without getting anything else).  The waitress came back, apologized that she couldn't get the gift card to run properly, so instead of being left with $8 on the card she just gave us a new $10 card.  Of course, this now means we'll have to go back. . .at least for a drink. ."}
{"text":"This was a very enjoyable dining experience. Sat at the bar detached from main restaurant waiting for friends and ended up staying the entire time. Our bartender, Chris, was engaging, friendly, professional, and quite knowledgeable. He answered all my questions about they're extensive tequila selection and made a damn delicious margarita. Food was very good as well. Pollo marg was solid and the Mahi tacos were tasty, but the apps impressed the most. Mole flautas were exceptional, and chorizo fundido was unique and hard to leave for any of my cohorts! Positive atmosphere, good food, great service. It's certainly a spot I'll return to"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. I'm sitting here with the worst tummy ache from eating at Tortilla Factory last night. I really wanted to love this place but the only thing to love is the patio and the sweet, albeit late servers. My friend D's veggie quesadila came...it was microwaveably uninteresting. My steak dish -Carne Del Fuego I think, never came, and when I asked to cancel it, it was brought out and unfortunately prob the worst concoction of flavours I ever tasted. It was as if someone chewed some meat up in their mouth, spit it out on my plate and covered it in warm honey mustard. It was reminiscent of spaghettio's. Sorry Tortilla Factory, I really am...and if I didn't have such a headache I might wax more poetic about the atmosphere. Bottom line, order some wine and soak in the beautiful patio. That's at least worth a few stars."}
{"text":"Not terrible but with all the other food options around I would try somewhere else. The food is okay, I expected it to be much better for the price. I got the old town tacos which are a build your own platter with shrimp, chicken, and steak. The shrimp was good but everything else I barely ate any of. The portions are very big. The margaritas were even disappointing, I got the premium marg and it was very sugary and served in a plastic margarita glass with a palm tree shaped stem...cheesy. Everyone else's margaritas didn't look appetizing either, they looked like they were straight out of a slushy machine and had either too much pink or green artificial dye. I did appreciate that they had a gluten free menu."}
{"text":"What an amazing place!  The ambiance was wonderful,  the food was delicious,  and the prices were fantastic!  The margarita was perfect and the service was exceptional.   I believe we have found our new date night place!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great ambiance, but the quality of food does not match.  First off, you have to pay for chips and salsa, which is fine, but I find pretty annoying for a Mexican restaurant.  I do expect if I'm paying for chips though, that they are made on site.  These tasted bagged and almost stale, though the salsa was good.  They are definitely trying to offer more upscale Mexican-influenced entrees, but the menu left something to be desired.  I ended up making a meal of sides.  The veggies were cooked fine, but the garlic mashed potatoes were gummy, and had absolutely no flavor.  For a restaurant that was a bit pricey, it's sad to walk away disappointed with your meal."}
{"text":"I was hesitant since the ratings were low, but my friend really wanted to try it.  I was surprisingly impressed.  We started with the chicken nachos - yummy and filling!  The we split the fuego and added shrimp.  Very large portions.  I loved the roasted red pepper tortillas with sage butter!  overall great experience, including the selection of margaritas!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was wonderful.  The tortillas were wonderful and the meal was good.  A bit disappointed that when the bill came we were charged for 2 sodas.  Apparently, there are no refills, so for anyone going be prepared to pay an outrageous price for a glass of ice and a little soda- NO FREE REFILLS.  To top it off I had not asked for as second one either."}
{"text":"I was asked to check our this restaurant while I was on vacation for a possible future work function and I cannot wait to go back. The surroundings were amazing along with fantastic service and stellar food. The Chorizo Fundido dip is a must for an appetizer and the Flan is a work of culinary art, I can't wait to have dinner here again."}
{"text":"Wow how did we miss this place! The food was amazing, service good and fast. We had fundido and tortillas to start with and carne de fuego to share and chocolate cake for desert. The jalapeño flavored butter is also to die for.  Highly recommend this place, will be coming back:)"}
{"text":"I found this place last April when I took my first work trip to the greater Phoenix area. It is located just west of the main drag of art galleries in Old Town Scottsdale. For someone who prefers mild warmth to severe heat, the atmosphere was perfect in April. Having just been there in February, the temperature was a little chilly.

The restaurant has an indoor seating area, though I cannot imagine a scenario when I would try to sit there. There is also a full patio which is why you have no reason to go inside. 

The patio (covered in the rain) has space heaters if it does get cold out. There is a beautiful fountain in the middle of the patio that mixes a fire and water show with ambiance. 

The menu is a modified Mexican. Traditional Mexican meals and tastes presented in new ways. The food is very good and I am told their margaritas, though not the best in town, are very good as well."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but the food is sub par compared with what you can get at other Mexican restaurants close by...over priced as well."}
{"text":"I had my first date with my Wife here about 4 years ago (2005), and I really like this place! Great Scottsdale atmosphere- Not snooty or pretentious, just classy enough! Nice quiet bar for drinks, and really good food."}
{"text":"We were very excited to eat here after reading some very good reviews. We just had to walk out because after 30 minutes we had not been acknowledged by any of the servers. Three walked by and did not even look at us. VERY Disappointed. Definitely wouldn't recommend. Plus nothing special was on the menu that impressed me."}
{"text":"The margaritas are watered down. There isn't a point of paying $13 for one. The food wasn't anything great. The food was over priced and not anything like Mexican food. The guacamole was watered down and looked like green chile hot sauce. The restaurant is hot! It felt like the AC was broken. A couple of tables complained how hot it was inside. 

My husband and I wouldn't not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"One star is for Samantha, who was great, and the second star is for the chocolate cake.   If the rating system could be negat8ve, our party of 5 would rate this place a minus 10.  It is ironic that a place with this name  DOES NOT know how to make tortillas!  The food was tasty, but, served COLD!!  Plates were not even heated.  It was like they were serving us leftovers from the refrigerator.  NEVER had cold Mexican food before except for salsa.  The tiny little tortillas are tasteless & made without salt.  Anyone who has ever eaten a\"real\" tortilla knows that they should not taste like  paper plates & napkins, both which have more flavor than what they try to pull off on tourists as tortillas.  They need to change their name to \"The Tasteless Tortilla Factory\" where everything is served cold. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!  The chocolate cake dessert served to celebrate a member of our party was best of all.  I would return just for that, which of course is cold with the ice cream & whipped cream.    Samantha, our server, has been there 10 years is one of the best servers We have ever had at any restaurant. We should have sent everything back to be served hot and asked her to go buy some tortillas from Manuel's, Garcia's, or Macayo's.  We felt embarrassed for Samantha to take it all back and we feared that their cooks.might spit on our our food, so, we boxed most of it and brought it home to heat it up properly,  today.  We could not believe they have been in business this long with the horrible bad recipe tortillas.   We all guessed that they cater to tourists who know nothing about how good contemporary Mexican food should taste.  We most certainly will NOT return & eat their overpriced cold food & tasteless tortillas.  Samantha and the chocolate cake were the only things good about our visit.  Don't waste your time and money at this joint!  They are too mamy other good fusion & traditional Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale that serve their food properly and whose tortillas taste better than toilet paper."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and both times we've had a good experience, the only reason why it's not 5 stars is that both times it took 10 minutes for someone to come to our table to get our order. We would get waters or our drinks, but then end up staring at each other since there was no waiter around.

I loved the house salad: field greens tossed with honey balsamic dressing, jicama, pico de gallo & mandarin oranges. Very fresh and nice blend of dark and light greens. Perfecto.

The Carne De Fuego entree was not bad, it was steak with chipotle honey sauce, good portions, I was stuffed at the end of the night!

Their Platinum margarita is delicious, I liked how they gave me whatever they couldn't pour in the margarita glass as well.

The outdoor patio dining area definitely made it a little more special for me and the hubs. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Fresh warm tortillas with garlic butter on the side were delicious and old town tacos were pretty good but rest of our food was dry, bland, over cooked and over priced. Very limited kids menu. Not the Mexican food restaurant we were hoping to eat at with free chips/salsa, burritos, tacos, etc. We did go in the early evening and the server told us they were unusually busy due to a groupon (although they didn't seem too busy and we got a table immediately). No one was seated outside, so unsure what the outdoor eating experience is like but photos look nice."}
{"text":"Uh... mazing! Hung out at the bar and had the apps which were all wonderful. Rick at the bar was the best. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Homemade tortillas weren't that great food sure didn't seem to be authentic Mexican cuisine.  Ambiance of lighted patio was wonderful but that was really all that was wonderful.  Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Location = awesome
Patio = awesome
Food = really good
Drinks = really good
Prices = are you kidding me expensive

That kind of sums it up. I love this place and all it's character, but every time I've gone I'm flabbergasted by the prices on items. I've eaten at plenty of fancier Mexican restaurants and this has got to be 25% higher than normal. That said - if they can charge it and stay busy then good for them :-)

It's cool how they make all their own tortillas and switch out the flavors all the time, and the variety of margaritas is impressive.

Fundido dip appetizer - yum! Rib were good, a bit dry. Tortilla soup - just ok. Tacos are delish and big enough for two.

I guess in summary it's a great restaurant but you'll drop a pretty penny on dinner."}
{"text":"I would probably pass on going here again. I love margaritas and they have a nice selection of tequilas. Problem is, they add some sort of mixer, maybe lemon lime soda to all their margaritas. There were four of us and no one cared for them. They are all pretty top shelf so $12 and up. Guacamole was pretty good. The queso with chorizo wasn't real great. The outside area was wonderful!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I've had a real hard time finding decent Mexican food in the valley and for once, I found a place that didn't disappoint. 

The atmosphere is fantastic!  Best I've found in the Phoenix area and the service was spot on. 

The food is pretty good but there are things I'd do different. Such as their use of aneheim chiles in their green chile dishes and sauces rather than authentic hatch New Mexican big Jim's...  but, I've found that most Arizonans hate anything spicy, so I understand. That's a Sonoran thing...  Part of being a successful business is knowing your market.  That said, as far as Mexican food goes, this place lands squarely in what's known as \"southwestern style\". Which, frankly, is a nice break from all the \"Sonoran\" style places around the valley.  (Sonoran is a Spanish word that means \"bland\") (lol)

The chips were average but the house salsa was pretty good. Nice flavor and a bit of heat. I asked for \"something hotter\" and was brought a ramekin of their habanero which had plenty of kick!  

For my main dish I had the chicken enchilada dish and the server told me the green sauce, even though not hatch green, was pretty good. I was skeptical so I ordered \"Christmas\". Once I explained what that meant, I got a dish with both the red and the green chile sauces. The red was pretty basic but the green, even though not hatch, was delicious. 

Moms had the old town tacos, which she said were delicious and Costa had the penne con pollo which he devoured. 

All in all it was a great meal and the staff didn't seem to mind a bit that we hung around for three hours even though they were pretty busy for a weeknight due to cooperate events they were hosting. 

Although the place is a little pricy, I can't wait to go back to try more stuffs!"}
{"text":"This could be so much better......great outdoor dining......asked for a Mojito....they didn't make them but was then told they have a full service bar.....still scratching my head......service was 3 stars.....food was just 3 stars....we had a party of 8 and it was just ok.....there are so many better places in this area.....it has the ambiance......that's about it."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. The service was outstanding (thanks Alex!). And enjoying our casual dinner with long-time friends outside under the strings of lights and fountain was perfect!  I'll go back when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Went with a large group on 1/29/2013 I thought it was going to be mexican food so was confused by the vegetarian quesadillas with light cheese for appetizers & dinner without beans, it was rice, vegetables, lots of zuchini, salad  had jicama which made it good & the steak with chipotle was quite good, it looked a little dry but ended up being nice and juicy and delicious. The chicken on the other hand was dry and the sauce was used sparingly so not sure what it was supposed to taste like, I was turned off after a couple bites. The salsa is not spicy so if you like spicy, which i do, it's disappointing but again...this is Tex-Mex so maybe Tex-Mex isn't supposed to be spicy. Margaritas were very lemon & like it had sprite or something in it, I had asked for cadillac margarita and I guess thats what I got, couldn't taste any alcohol. The good thing the food seemed much more lighter and healthier if  that's what you are looking for. The place is really cool looking too."}
{"text":"I really loved this place! Don't know what the reviews are bad because i had a great experience. We started with the chips and guac and there was a ton of guac and it was so delicious. I had the tacos which were awesome and lots of flavor and also huge portions. My friend and I both had margaritas and loved them as well! Only issue is the wait is ridiculous and they don't take reservations..."}
{"text":"Great place to sit outside and enjoy a Margarita!  The Pork Verde is the best and also love the homemade torillas!"}
{"text":"The outside patio is so fun!! Service is good and the flour tortillas are amazing. It's definitely a different take on \"Mexican food.\" I had the stuffed chicken and it was really good. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Amazing. The food, atmosphere, service, margaritas..everything was amazing. I had chicken nachos and Mahi tacos that were soooo good. I also had a blue agave margarita that was one of the best I have ever had. I would definitely recommend this place for good food and drinks with friends!"}
{"text":"Bueno. No muy fatastico.  I could have had those enchiladas at cafe rio. But a nice ambience. Service was timely and food delivered warm not hot. For $50, Eh."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. I had to ask the manager to find out about our food since it was more than an hour wait from the time we ordered. Our waitress did not update us to why there was a delay and did not refill our drinks. I know that since I don't drink alcohol I do not get looked in on as frequently but an hour without service?  Then the food was brought out by the manager cold. Also miraculously the waitress came to the table when the manager brought our food. I can count on one hand how many times I have not tipped in my 48 years since high school paying for my meals. Last night was one of them. The food wasn't good either."}
{"text":"Warning: My review might be jaded because I had just had amazing Mexican food at Dick's Hideaway (yum!) just the night before.  

The outdoor patio lighting was nice, but failed to give us the romantic atmosphere we were hoping for.  It also kept starting to rain on us.  One additional star for the waiter for being super willing and nice and able to find us an indoor table that we passed on 3 different times.

I love Mexican and Tex-Mex, but this restaurant was sub-par.  We had the appetizer sampler platter.  The santa fe roll was weird.  I dont like that the shredded/mashed beef was cold.  The flavor was just weird. The cheese sauce on the nachos was decent, as well as the pico de gallo that came on top. The ribs were okay, and were served room temperature.  The quesadillas were also just okay.

I was confused by the pablano pepper tortillas and butter they brought out.  I didn't know what to do with them.  Tried the butter on the tortilla.  Tasted like regular tortilla.  

I couldn't find the stuffing in my stuffed filet mignon.  It was just an 'okay' steak. 

For dessert we had the flan.  The almond liqueur gave it a good kick and was a good differentiating factor.  The slivered almonds was nice.

Sorry, but I won't come back.  There are plenty of other good & better Mexican restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I've never been terribly impressed with the food. Way overpriced for the mediocre entrees they're serving up. But this is a great place to go for drinks & appetizers - sit on the patio around the fountain. The appetizers are decent and fairly priced and the ambiance is really nice. I like to take tourists here when they visit me. (Then if they're still hungry, we'll go to Los Sombreros for dinner!)

Do try their homemade tortillas with flavored butter - they're better than anything on the menu."}
{"text":"service was decent, food was good. i wouldnt say the food was amazing. but the portion size was a bit small for me. and for the price i was paying i would say that this place is a bit overpriced for what i was getting. i have had better food for less but the food is decent, just like the service. nothing to remember."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a drink one night after dinner. It was OK. I had the cactus margarita which was really strong on the Midori and cactus juice not much tequila. Which was disappointing as they are known for the 100 different kinds that they carry.  Staff and service was OK but they were distracted by the AZ  Monday night football game. We did not eat so this review is mostly for the bar."}
{"text":"Only a 2 because of the great atmosphere. The patio and lights were terrific at night.

Unfortunately the food was terrible.  Possibly the worst Mexican food I've ever had (and I've had a lot!).  I was vacationing in Phoenix with my wife and fell for the pretty pictures of the patio.

They attempt to be innovative (eg cilantro tortillas with butter for an appetizer ... Which was awful) but it doesn't end up tasting like Mexican food or frankly anything that I'd care to eat

The chili verde was nearly inedible.  The sauce was soupy with very odd flavors and the meat was gristly and of low quality.  

Avoid and hopefully the'll close down and something else will move into this great location"}
{"text":"I visited the Old Town Tortilla factory about five years ago with fond memories so when back in Scottsdale tonight I decided to give it another go.

I should have read the Yelp reviews before going, my experience was nothing special. My waiter was friendly enough but the food was just OK. I ordered the Grilled Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos. Upon my waiters advice I order the \"sauce\" on the side because I was concerned about them being too spicy. What I received was three \"chunks of fish\" on three mini tortillas with four small condiment bowls containing the black beans, jalapeño sauce, guacamole and a white cucumber sauce? It just looked kinda strange and the fish wasn't all that fresh. I didn't complain because my waiter only asked if I wanted dessert. 

Maybe it's me but it just wasn't what I expected. I think there are a lot of other good choices in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've been so excited to try this restaurant and finally did this week. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment and probably one of the worse places I've ever eaten. This includes food and service. Our server, Mike, was horrible and inattentive. Perhaps because he was so young and had little if any experience serving. Don't get me wrong he seemed like a nice kid just horrible at customer service. We stared with the chicken lettuce wraps which sounds refreshing with chicken, strawberries, and pecans but were served drenched in dressing and the chicken tasted as if it came from a can. I had one bite and my husband ate the rest only cause he is always the nice one and doesn't believe in returning food cause he said they just throw it away and that's a waste. For dinner I ordered the pork chili. Mike said it was one of his favorites??? A bowl of shredded dry pork with some diced potatoes arrived. For $17 I expected a bit more. I had one bite and no more. Mike our server must have walked by us at least 5 times and never stopped to ask how anything and when he did he asked if I wanted a to go box. Sure why not I got two dogs at home. Wouldn't you wonder if something was wrong if your customer barely touched their meal. Oh well $76 later and I can take the Tortilla Factory OFF my list for good.  Please save your money and time and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Trent is down home friendly. Works a bottle opener like a gunslinger and never forgets a name. Was a pleasure. I will definitely be back to try the menu."}
{"text":"Although I did enjoy the food here, I was completely unimpressed (and slightly annoyed) by the overpriced margaritas.  I ordered a platinum which contained \"fresh\" juice.   It tasted like it had sprite in it, so I thought surely she gave me the wrong one.   It turns out that \"fresh juice\" is really margarita mix on tap from the same gun as the sprite.   I asked for something fresh to replace the horrible margarita and received a rocks glass with just muddled lime and a salted rim.   I'm not sure it contained any tequila.   Horrible!   It's not that hard to make a fresh margarita!"}
{"text":"i heard so much about this place, so came with very high expectations.  the outdoor patio dining space is nice, the lighting is cute.  they have good tortillas and the tequila sampler was good.  everything else was just edible.  the funny thing is that everything looked tex-mex, and the ingredients were mexican but it just didn't taste so mexican to me.  maybe they should rename this place fusion tortilla joint - this way people can better prepare their taste buds and expectations.

lesson learned: filter the concierge recommendations with yelp."}
{"text":"I have seen the advertisement many times in the magazines at the phoenix airport. Also got postcards in the mail many times. They have very good marketing system. 

We went there on Friday night. It took long time for the \"Tortilla and butter\" that they provide upon sitting to arrive. And then it took over 30 minutes after we ordered the food to arrive. The taste was pretty bland. We were hungry and we still could not like the food. 

The sitting arrangement was the only thing nice and the nice weather helped. It is over hyped. None of us in our group will go back there again."}
{"text":"Fantastic, the food was great salsa was good and spicy. The tortillas were nice and thin."}
{"text":"Old Town Tortilla Factory is a fabulous find in old town Scottsdale.  You begin your meal with delicious homemade flavored tortillas. The food is just as delicious as their tortillas. I had the build your own tacos and it came with 3 types of meat, beans, rice,  lettuce and pico. The meat was cooked to perfection. The outdoor patio is perfect for a night out with friends,  a date or even a large group of people.   The staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"The outdoor seating is a must on a night in Scottsdale with the fountain and lighting on a large patio making it a fantastic atmosphere.  When we sat down we were brought fresh tortillas with a hint of jalepeno and some garlic butter which was a nice change of pace from chips and salsa.  The margaritas were good and combined with the extra amount in the shaker there was a fairly good amount of it too!  The green enchilada was good but for the price there are better options out there.  

Overall:
Great Outdoor Seating
Liked the tortillas instead of chips
Good margaritas"}
{"text":"I've been to Tortilla Factory several times with mixed reviews.  The food is solid, but tourist Mexican with no real hot food options on menu.  Beware of the \"Chile Verde\", it's a tomatillo based water sauce that is a joke.  Drive over to New Mexico to get proper Chile Verde.  

Last night we were seated in the beautiful courtyard Nextel fire and waterfall. Unfortunately our server was more d in the girl waiter he was flirting with than our service.  I've heard that the kitchen takes forever and this trip was the worse of all.  Sat with our kids for an hour to get our meal.  Restaurants that don't work to the end of the evening are just poorly managed and this place is obviously very bad in that department.

It's a cool Scottsdale location, but beware unless you are patient enough to put up with poor service and a long wait."}
{"text":"I've got to add to the chorus of one and two-star reviews for this place. Another Scottsdale establishment that's faaaaar too pricey and waaaay too full of itself to justify the median price of $11 for margaritas (mine was served in a small, 10 oz. glass, and was mediocre. And don't even get me started on the food menu - which I gladly passed on, though I could have eaten). 

The atmosphere in the daytime is blah to average at best, with a gaggle of servers all congregating and giggling amongst themselves too busily to distract for something called...\"service\". And, servers? Listen up...never, ever address your valued customers as \"buddy,\" or 'bud\". It's plain condescending. That's \"sir\", or the name on my gold card. And your server's salary is much too jeopardized to be smirking your way through your Tom Cruise in Cocktail trying-to-impress-the-girls-not-the-customers fantasy...okay, bud? That's why you got a 12% tip tonight. Oooooh, I know it hurts, but you need to shape up and read a book called \"Customer Service for Beginners\", grow up and step into the real world, bud.

Alternative to night out at Douche Factory: grab some Fresh and Easy tortilla chips and awesome restaurant-style salsa, a sixer of Corona, some fajita fixins and a friend, and settle in for an actually ENJOYABLE evening - all for about a fifth of the cost (or less) of this sorry-ass place."}
{"text":"A group of us went to Old Town Tortilla Factory as a local recommended the place. We sat outside on the patio, and it was nice to feel the water mist.

The food is NOT worth the price. I shared a Green Chile Enchilada Stack ($12) and Pollo Margarita ($20) with two other friends. The entrees were not impressive. The enchilada had so much cheese on it and I could barely taste the tortilla and the chicken. The enchilada sauce didn't bring out any flavor to the dish. The Pollo Margarita was stuffed chicken breast with cheese and peppers. It was topped with tequilla citrus sauce, and included potato cakes and vegetables. The chicken was sooooo dry. For $20, I was expecting to eat excellent chicken.

In addition, we had to ASK for the homemade tortillas. Come on!! Since they are known to make the tortillas, I was expecting tortillas to be made constantly.

Eh, not a good restaurant."}
{"text":"I always here great stuff about this place.

The food and service totally suck.

The tortillas are pretty good and the scenery is great but seriously, a blind homeless guy could cook better.

Complete rip off, dont believe the hype."}
{"text":"My first experience at Old Town Tortilla Factory was nearly 11 years ago and this place is just as good as ever.  I hosted a large group dinner (120+ people) in May and we thoroughly enjoyed a buffet dinner sitting under the lights and stars of the beautiful patio.  The food was great - just the right amount of spice and flavor, the staff was efficient and friendly and the atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"I read really great reviews about this place and had the impression that I HAD to come here while I was vacationing in Scottsdale. The tortillas were good, no doubt. But everything else was just kind of bland. We did sit outside and the mister system they had was leaking on our table, which didn't help matters. I wouldn't rush to go back if I were in town."}
{"text":"Well, folks . . . . It's all about the atmosphere.  Courtyard dining under festive  lighted trees.  Great, fresh Mexican plates and a vast assortment of our favorite tequilas.  The setting is casual and authentic.  We loved it.  Service was attentive and prices were very reasonable considering to volume of delicious food presented to dining guests.  The only thing missing was a strolling mariachi guitar band doing our favorite songs.  Loved all of it.  Treat yourself.  If on a date, if you don't score tonight, you need training, amigo."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad but the ambiance and outdoor seating really make for an enjoyable dinner. 

The chips and salsa or overpriced but the Old Town Tacos are a pretty good deal and usually have the right amount of flavor. Nothing is overly spicy or full of flavor which is a plus for those adverse to spice. I usually end up adding all sorts of salsas and hot sauce to get it where I want lol.

The food would be about three stars for me but once you add in the outdoor seating and ambiance it quickly jumps up to a four. It's a nice place to go with someone you love but I wouldn't go in expecting to be blown away by the food alone."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. My first time here was great. I sat outside and the atmosphere was awesome. The service is good and the portions are large. I love the Margheritas and the guac is very tasty.  The old town tacos are amazing. However, the second time I dined here I ate inside and  the atmosphere was dark and crowded. The tables were too small and the space is cramped. I would go back here in the summer when the weather is nice because the experience is completely different when you can sit outside. It was like going to two different restaurants depending on the weather."}
{"text":"Beautiful day for outdoor dining.  We were early for dinner - they were not yet busy. Our service and food were good and we will return on our next visit to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Make no mistake - this isn't a mexican restaurant, and the menu seemed somewhat random to me.  Anywho.  

My husband and I arrived early to head to the bar for a drink before our reservation.  I ordered a margarita, and loved the extra shaker that went along with it - nice touch!

The group arrived and we headed to the patio, which was made quite warm by the heaters.  We started with one order of the Chorizo Fundido, and were brought two big bowls of chips and salsa to go along with it.  Word on the street was that it was delicious, but as a vegetarian I withheld.  A little while later, we were served some yummy warm tortillas and butter - a nice treat!  

There aren't many vegetarian options.  I was able to ask for the tacos with extra black beans instead of the meat, and our server was extra accommodating.  It came with 3 small tortillas and a plate full of lettuce, guac, beans, tomatoes, and rice.  It was good....but a little pricey for what it was.  

Overall, this was an A-Ok restaurant but our server made it a Yay!  He was friendly and helpful.  He was professional.  He offered, pleasantly, to split checks for our group of 8 and even knew who was together.  Kudos to him!"}
{"text":"Terrible place. Dead atmosphere, you have to pay for chips & salsa, wouldn't even make accommodations for a vegetarian plate, etc. We enjoyed the water, but not the service and options. We left."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you're a foodie looking amazing flavors. Go here if you are looking for good margs and a great atmosphere. Disappointing."}
{"text":"We were walking around Old Scottsdale, trying to settle on a place to get a relatively quick bite.  When our first choices were further away than anticipated, we opted for Old Tortilla Factory, thinking from the description that it might be a tad kitschy.  When we saw the patio, we thought, \"not too bad\" and decided to stay.

Unlike the other reviewers, our server was friendly and helpful and attentive to our requests.  I was not, however, terribly impressed by the food, even those famous tortillas. 

We started with the queso fundido, which was very watery, and not nearly as flavorful as I'd expect.  This was served along side some red pepper tortillas with jalapeno butter.  The butter was good.  The tortillas were ok, a little on the dense/doughy side for my liking.  Admittedly, I prefer corn, so I was biased from the start, but they tasted just like any other flour tortillas I could find at a supermarket.

For the mains, we got the chicken calabacitas and the pork chile verdes.  The sauce on the chicken was the highlight of my meal - creamy, garlicky, full of flavor.  The chicken underneath was moist, and the accompanying relish was quite tasty.  The pork chile verdes was disappointing.  The pork was dry, the sauce was watery, the potatoes undercooked.  Definitely not worth it.

The drinks were good.  The patio atmosphere was relaxing.  But the food wasn't worth the cost."}
{"text":"Old Town Tortilla Factory does a fantastic job with Mexican/New Mexican cuisine.  The chicken pinwheels that were supposedly featured on the Food Network or something are phenomenal.  There's a good variety of entrees featuring different types of seafood and meat, and plenty of southwest flavors.  The margaritas, served with a little shaker of extra, are excellent too.  My mom actually drank a whole one, which, maybe you don't know my mom, but, trust me, is saying something.  The ambiance out on the patio (when it's not too hot outside) is quite comfortable and cozy, with the fountain and the strings of lights.  Also, they have homemade flavored tortillas, with different flavors featured daily, but sometimes the waitstaff doesn't seem overly eager to give them out.  Had to deduct one star for service.  Other than that, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The best homemade tortillas in Scottsdale!! Located in a historic adobe home in Old Town Scottsdale.  Dishes include ancho raspberry-encrusted pork chops and Shawnee sea bass with a cheese and rock shrimp quesadilla, topped with shoestring sweet potatoes. The banana crisp wrapped in a sweet tortilla with blackberry compote is out of this world."}
{"text":"Terrible service. After sitting at our table for 25 minutes we left and checked in again at the hostess station.  We were seated at another table and explained our situation to the hostess who said she would send a manager over. This never happened and we did not receive service for 15 more minutes. We watched 2 tables in the same section leave. Waiter didn't care and service was very slow still. Food was okay but $17 for enchiladas??? Skip it!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful on the outside of the restaurant, but it was a cold day and we went inside.  Not very attractive, but warm.  the waitress was also very nice.  Asked for quesadillas made extra crispy with condiments on the side- got neither bc it was baked, not crisped in a pan and the condiments were on top.  So changed to nachos, but no cheese on them. when i asked the waitress, she said the sauce drizzled over top was cheese sauce.  but if it was, it was watered down with sour cream. my aunt got tostadas- meat wasn't so good, no beans or cheese on them. on one positive note, the green enchiladas tasted good per my uncle. agree with other reviewer- awesome ambiance outside but the food lacks substance."}
{"text":"Just decided to walk here for an easy dinner.  Went into the bar and the bar tender took care of us all night even though we only ordered a drink each.  

The amount of Tequila and varieties I've only seen at a bar on St Thomas.  Impressive!  

I ordered a Victoria and she ordered the Blue Agave Margarita, the lady thoroughly enjoyed the margarita which was worth the $10 as you basically got three smalls in the shaker after than just the one glass.  

I ordered the Carne de Fuego which was excellent and on second glance I took notice of the sweet potato puree stuffed in the Anaheim Chile.  I liked that look.  She ordered the green chile chicken enchiladas, they were delicious and in her safe zone...I didn't even notice this was Tex-Mex because it was so GOOD."}
{"text":"Breakdown:

Ambiance and Atmosphere - 5 Stars
Food - 3 Stars
Food vis-à-vis Price - 2 Stars
On the Balance - 3 Stars

Old Town Tortilla Factory isn't as bad as some of the reviewers on here make it out to be.  It's a beautiful place to have a nice dinner and enjoy the lovely Arizona desert climate, and the food is acceptable, too.  Where it really stumbles, however, is price, and for that reason my overall opinion is that Old Town Tortilla factory is simply average.

Ambiance - This is where Old Town Tortilla Factory really shines.  The place is in a cozy cottage compound with a couple of buildings (one being an old house).  The architecture is reminiscent of older architecture in the area, and this place can accommodate anything from small romantic dinners for two to huge banquets and anything in between.  The real star is the patio.  It is lovely year-round, and the lighting and water details make this a very pleasant place to dine.  They even have heaters for those who may get a bit chilly.

Food - The food is just average.  It is a fairly standard/conservative/traditional style menu.  There isn't a lot of avant-garde cuisine coming out of this place.  Still, what they do is done competently.  The food was hot, fresh, and perfectly good.  It wasn't as good as some of the more authentic Mexican places in town, and you can easily find more flavorful, complex, and spicy traditional food.  Still, it's not like their food is bad.  It's pretty good, it's just not anything special.

Food vis-à-vis Price - If you're out on the town for a gastronomical experience divorced from ambiance, the Old Town Tortilla Factory does not offer a particularly compelling value.  As I said above, the food isn't bad, but it's just standard.  If you put their food in a lineup with dishes from several other restaurants across the southwest, you're not going to be able to distinguish it out of the crowd of other fairly similar dishes.  Despite average food, they have significantly above average prices.  Expect to pay at least $25-30 per person with one drink and a shared appetizer to go along with one of their lower priced entrees.  If you dine toward the top end of their menu, where entrees can reach as high as $35, it's going to be a pricy night.  That, combined with the fairly expensive drinks and the $3.99 sharing charge on split entrees, you're not going to walk away from this for the price of  \"FourthMeal.\"

On the whole, I give this place three stars.  If I were simply simply reviewing this place based on the food, and I were to divorce the ambiance and atmosphere, it would be a two star joint primarily because of a poor value proposition.  However, considering how compelling the atmosphere is, I'll give them the third star.  The patio is really remarkable, and it's just a very nice place to sit and relax in the Arizona desert.  It's near old town, but it's much more intimate than the very loud establishments closer to Scottsdale Road.

I tend to focus my reviews on food quality, but ambiance is definitely a part of the dining out experience, and that's where Old Town Tortilla Factory shines.  The food is average but overpriced, but the space is just lovely.  It's not an everyday place, and it's not even a place I would go if I were only craving some Mexican food, but if you need a dining experience where the atmosphere is important (perhaps entertaining some out of town guests), Tortilla Factory is worth a look."}
{"text":"I expected tacos, tacos and more tacos..  What I ordered didn't even come with beans.  the tortilla du jour was spicy, and not amazing. However the food was pretty good.  One of our entrees was pasta, and it  was very good.  My Something Fuego, had far too many green peppers, and nothing to do with a taco.  Ok, I could have spent a lot more time reading the menu.  What I read was on Yelp, and I didn't get it.  Margarita was VERY good... at one of the lower priced drinks.  No meals in the bar"}
{"text":"Great place to eat outdoors.  They have tons of flavors of tortillas and give you some of their freshly made tortillas of the day with some sort of buttery spread complimentary before your meal.

The House Margarita is pretty excellent and you can refill your glass with the shaker they leave at your table.  Almost 2 glasses worth.

The outdoor area is filled with plants and trees and twinkling lights.  If you're in the mood for outdoor dining, this is a great option!"}
{"text":"$85 on dinner & it wasn't all that. We got 3 cocktails, chips and salsa, and 2 meals. The both of us got the tacos that included the steak, shrimp, and chicken. First of all, it's insane to pay for chips and salsa when I'm paying $60+ on a dinner for two. The chips and salsa were ok, salsa wasn't very flavorful and had no spice at all. I like my salsa to be at least a little spicy (personal preference). Anyways, my friend had about 2 pieces of shrimp on his plate, while I had about 6. There was close to zero amount of other things we could fill our tacos with & the chicken was completely bland. And let's not forget that we walked in at 6 and finally walked out at about 7:30 and there were only about two or three other guests. So, yes the service was nonexistent. The server was rude, no personality, he barely waited on us, never refilled our drinks or came to check on our food. Nothing! & it's a shame because we would have probably gotten a lot more cocktails if he would have come over, so their loss. I definitely wouldn't make another trip back here, completely overrated and way better selection of Mexican food in this area."}
{"text":"I would describe this is A-OK, nothing blew my mind but nothing was bad either. The only thing I would give 5 stars to was the venue itself. Sweet separated bar area from the dining area and an amazing outside patio/courtyard.

I went on a Saturday night with my family and we had a lot of dishes. I really wished the queso was hotter (temperature wise) and a much larger portion. My combo plate was good but not amazing as I had hoped for. Again nothing was bad I was just hoping for more. The different tortillas we tried we all delicious. Id go back here again just to drink in the courtyard and snack. Im not sold on the full dinner experience as it was just so-so. The service was stellar though"}
{"text":"Every time we visit Scottsdale we visit Olde Town Tortilla Factory. They make different flavored fresh tortillas. The night we went they had cheddar tortilla with a basil butter. My favorite is the sun dried tomato butter. 
Must start with the Chorizo Fundido, a quest sip with chorizo and peppers. 
Not the place for basic Mexican food, go for steak, Carne de Fuego or the Grilled Salmon. 
Service is not memorable, the girl suggested the most basic item, like tacos. Server tip 101 don't suggest the cheapest item on the menu. 
Quality of food and atmosphere are enough to compensate. Sit outside if you can, it's beautiful out."}
{"text":"Seriously 5 stars for ambiance! This place is very original since it was an old house turned into a restaurant. The garage is actually the bar, but it does not have a garage feeling or look. Had \"quite a few\" of the Horny Margaritas and they were delish! Fresh squeezed citrus juice with sugar water they actually make. They know how I do margaritas! Had the fish tacos, simple, but so fresh and tasty. The prices are on the higher end, but it shows in the quality of food, location and decor/ambiance, etc. The service was decent, nothing spectacular, but certainly not bad either. Never felt rushed, very relaxing and enjoyable! Great spot to have a nice fresh meal, few adult beverages and excellent conversation!"}
{"text":"Fun tequila bar in authentic Old Town setting. Perfect for locals and visitors alike! Food was superb and margaritas were even better! Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"It has a nice patio and decent quality ingredients however the flavors are geared for tourists who want to tread lightly. 

To best enjoy yourself here come order a marrita sit on the patio and snack on some chips with your dip of choice. Note the salsa is quite mild again for the tourists I believe. The service here is quite good as is the selection on the menu."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, as was the service, no complaints there.  The food and drinks - let's face it, you can find better in and around town.  Not sure our margaritas had alcohol, though they were pretty tasty and for the price should've come with a fifth of tequila. For $15-30 a plate, you think you'd get a little more for your dollar, like chips and salsa included. 

We'll probably stick with the more traditional Mexican from now on, but if we've got family in town this might... Might be a choice."}
{"text":"3 stars for the nice outdoor dining (when cool enough) area and the service but more importantly in this case 2 stars for most everything else.

Had one of their recommended margaritas and although the taste was nice and light for a warm evening there was a reason it was nice and light...I don't know if they pour extra warm ingredients over the ice then shake it up a lot for a watered down taste or if there is simply no booze in the drink but was extremely weak and my guest said his was the same.

I ordered the fish tacos of which there were three and they were just OK.  Served on tiny corn tortillas with a very small amount of jalapeno sauce and no roasted corn guacamole which it should have come with. My guest had the achiote ribs which surprisingly came as an entire slab. Neither he nor I were familiar with achiote sauce beyond knowing that achiote is a spice but even if we were we would have expected the \"glazed with...\" description to be an actual glaze and not a 1-inch thick bland paste. The ribs were tender just not as flavorful as one would have thought.

Overall the place was overpriced for the quality for food and beverage.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Food = Great
Atmosphere = Great
Service = So So

We were told we had an hour wait and went to the bar for drinks and appetizers. Waited 15 minutes to get acknowledged. We finally got to order (had to pay for chips & salsa?!?) and just got our drinks when our table was suddenly ready, which was a nice surprise.  Once seated we had pretty decent service and the food was great.  Wouldn't recommend during Spring Training season or on a busy night but would on a slower night."}
{"text":"Watered down marguerites. I think they put sprite in their house drinks which is sad.  The food was bland and needed salt. The service was very slow and the waitress was not attentive. We ordered guacamole with our chips and got it 40 mins later after asking twice for it."}
{"text":"This place is just plain rank.  We were seated late - the food came cold and late and the time between the first plate and the last plate brought to our table was over 20 mins. I do not care if they comped the appetizers or the last entree' the place is a joke, and some loser in the bathroom asked me Hurry up while I was peeing in the urinal!!  It almost got violent.  Not only is the restaurant a loser the customers are also."}
{"text":"Great spot for a large gathering. The place has great ambience being outside while enjoying good food and drinks."}
{"text":"This is a must for Old Town.  We had a friendly efficient waitperson.  The mahi mahi tacos are fresh and delicious with tons of fish on each one.  Two people in our party had red enchiladas and they thought they were some of the best that they have had.  The house margarita is fair not anything special.  The atmosphere is very pretty with lots of seating options."}
{"text":"Went to the Factory thinking that it was going to be some great place that gives you beans and rice for some spectacular tortillas.  One would be lead to think since they are called \"The Tortilla Factory\".  But this wasn't the case.  As someone stated below the tortillas are your starter.  They give it to you in place of chips and salsa, or bread and butter.  

Looking at the menu we really didn't see what we thought we were going to see, we got some recommendations from the staff and ended up with Meatloaf (very good by the way) and a dried out pork chop that was covered in a chipotle raspberry sauce (gave me a great idea for my next BBQ) they stated this dish was there best/fav. dish.  

Very overpriced.  Margaritas that can run you from $8-$35.  Yeah it was good (I got the $10 marg.) and would have loved to ordered another, but we still had to pay for the food.

Overall, I would go back knowing what to expect.  We would order less and eat more of the free tortillas and salsa.  We could have even shared an entree, and gotten some appetizers.  The entrees were large and we had take home.  The flavors of the food were terrific.  The meatloaf was wrapped with bacon.....tasty...."}
{"text":"This place is only for cocktails on the patio for the nice local. The menu was nothing but heavy-heavy dishes in the heat of Spring they need to lighten the menu options. I mean really- Rack of Ribs, Steak, Stuffed Chicken and some other options that weren't very good. 

Don't get me started on the staff!  Our waiter was arrogant and uninformative. If you don't want to be known as a Mexican restaurant maybe you should change the name....last I looked tortilla's were strictly a Mexican dish. So what kind of restaurant is it?  Over priced and living on it's historic name and local. 

So if you go for drinks, I'm with Noah the house margarita is the best and it packs a kick so be careful!  My friend had the fancier version and didn't like it as well as the house."}
{"text":"The food here is decent and the patio is cute, but the service is terrible. And the prices, for the quality of food, are a bit high. My husband and I don't eat meat so we tried to order a dish without the steak and with shrimp instead. They charged us the full price of the dish for steak AND THEN the cost to add shrimp. So a Mexican dish ended up costing $30. When we pointed this out they took $4 off our bill. Super disappointed with this place as it has potential."}
{"text":"Rolled in last Saturday...still hot so we sat inside. Great atmosphere...service kind of slow however our waiter was very helpful. We ordered margaritas (platinum) they were served in a shaker A+ for that as we re-filled our glasses twice-good value. The chips were a bit stale the salsa OK, the flavored tortillas were great! I ordered the pork chops the wife a salad...the wife liked her salad and my chops were fantastic....the portions of both meals were huge A++. The overall dining experience with atmosphere was a solid 3-1/2 stars so I will round up because our waiter did a great job."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, friendly service and fantastic margaritas in a wonderful back patio. We love this place and also go back when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"You know how your wife or girlfriend is always whining about how you never listen to them? This of course as a shoe comes whistling past your cranium.
Well The Tortilla Factory must have the same listening skills....their management never listens either.

You would think that after 111 reviews, someone over there would recognize there's a problem with the service. 
Nope.
This would lead one to conclude no-one in management knows about Yelp, or, and I suspect this is more the case, they can't read,

Prior to writing this, I read some of those 111 reviews in an effort to see how my experience last night paired-up.
Uncannily, it was true to form, explaining why this place gets two and a half stars.

Service was bad with waiters only stopping by to sell more drinks.
Had to ask for the tortillas twice before ever seeing them..appx 20 minutes waiting on the free tortillas.
Hey TF, do I need to remind you of your namesake???

And the prices for the amazingly tasteless food will stupefy you. (I sampled everyone's food in our party of eight) 

Old Town Tortilla Factory...you're really one sneaky bastard.
Laying in wait....for all the unsuspecting Scottsdale visitors looking for the 'Mexican Food' experience, and instead ambushing them with your bad service, high prices and tasteless garbage you call food.

But you do have some nice attributes, which is why, similar to my situation of never listening, I still have a wife.
Only I'm not sure how a fountain, large patio and a cutesy margarita cup are going to keep you in business.
Oh well, who cares...right?
There'll be another plane full of visitors headed your way tomorrow. 

Are you related to Rustlers Roost by any chance? 
You both have so much in common."}
{"text":"I had my rehersal dinner here for my wedding.  I had a lot of people coming in from out of town and staying at the Vally Ho so we chose this place because it was within walking distance.  I must say I was hesitant because I went with my then fiance (now husband) for dinner one night just to check it out and I was not impressed with the food.  However my very large group was so well accomodated, I couldn't have asked for more.  I would hightly recommend getting the hors d'oeurves packages that they offer.  A great price and something for everyone, they can get a plate and munch at bar tops with drinks while talking to everyone.  It was like having a bar with drinks and food just for my wedding party and family.  A truly great experience and I look forward to using this restaurant in the future for any event that requires a great atmosphere with great food and great service, for a large party."}
{"text":"This is a staple Mexican restaurant for me, the food is delicious and the patio is lovely. Great place to grab a bite and sit outside as the weather starts to cool down!"}
{"text":"This place is the perfect example of a tourist trap.  Nice location not far of the main drag of Old Scottsdale, beautiful building and layout.  The margaritas are good, but probably $2-$3 more expensive than they ought to be for every one of the many styles.  I thought paying $5 for chips and salsa was a rip-off, but then when the chips tasted stale, I was even less happy.  C'mon, if you have tortilla and factory in your name, you ought to have fresh chips.  I thought the tortillas themselves were okay, not great, but okay.  The carne fuego, or whatever I had the waitress recommended, was not good.  Small chunks of fire roasted steak completely ruined by a gloppy sweet/hot sauce. The veggies that went with it were just okay and the sweet potato-stuffed chile was weird.  It could've been great, but it was nowhere near good.  Unless your Aunt Hattie who has never had Mexican food is in town from Ohio, i'd skip this place altogether."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner this evening at the Old Town Tortilla Factory in Scottsdale.  We didn't know what to expect after reading some of the reviews.
We got right in and seated as soon as we got there. Water was brought to us as soon as we sat down.  Our waiter was excellent, very attentive.
We had the Carne De Fuego and the Pollo Margarita.  Both meals were great.  Food was well prepared and hot.
Thought the place, service and food were very good and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Texas visiting this weekend.  GREAT patio. OMG loved every bit of being outside.  The food is really pretty good but the tastes here are a smidge different than Texas.  I like my food spicy. I had the green enchiladas that were just wonderful and the black beans were NOT bland.  The salsa and guacamole are wonderful here.  Beer ice cold too.  Would come back again."}
{"text":"Came again recently.  Similar experience to last time.  Long wait even with reservations.  They charge you for chips, wow.  We had a waitress that was in a bad mood just seemed unfriendly.  Outdoor patio is the best thing about this place very charming.  Food choices are strange for a Mexican place there is very few Mexican dishes.  Food was OK overall.  Probably wont try this place again for a few more years."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good food, steer clear. We are never ones to not finish our meals, and we will eat just about anything - and neither of us finished what we got. 

I will say, the patio is nice, our server was great, and the margarita was good as well. If you are looking for a happy hour place to grab drinks, then come here. But don't eat."}
{"text":"This place used to be phenomenal.  The last two times I've been here, you can tell there has been a decline in food quality & service.  We arrived right as they were opening.  When I called to make a reservation (which they don't take for small parties), they never informed us the entire main restaurant was closed for a private party.  Our only seating options were inside the bar area or outside on the patio in the 107 degree heat. My boyfriend's parents can't sit in 100+ temperatures.  The bar area we were seated in, wreaked of a wet, dirty bar.  Exactly what you'd expect.  I asked for chips & salsa (standard at almost all other Mexican restaurants).  Was told it was an appetizer.  I ordered the $6.00 chips & salsa and the generous portion of chips were old & stale.  The salsa was watered down & tasteless.  The homemade tortillas with flavored butter are still very good.  I ordered the Old Town Tacos and my boyfriend's parents ordered the Sonoran Meatloaf.  The food was decent but the overall experience was average.  There are too many great restaurants in this area of Scottsdale, to settle on this spot."}
{"text":"The good: Margaritas, fresh tortillas, service.
The bad: bland, over-priced food.  Don't put a pepper beside a dish on the menu representing a \"spicy\" dish and then have it be bland of flavor and heat.  I had the pork chili verde and the pork was boiled and tough.  
I really did want to like this place more-the ambiance is great and if you just want to meet up with friends for some nachos and drinks, then you will be fine.  But, if you want to go and have a good meal....there are many better choices in the area."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful specially the patio area. Now they have all this different rules and things you cannot do and they will charge you for breathing. This place is expensive and I am sorry but it is Mexican food so there's no reason for it to be this expensive in my opinion.

We wanted to watch some of the football games and the only place we could was in their tequila bar area, which was empty, but the worse part is that the TVs were so small that we could not really see the game anyway because we couldn't even read the score, so definitely do not come here to watch any games...

We were seated and greeted by our waitress. She did not come by often and I do not believe she was that smart either but she got her job done I guess. The food was ok and again not worth the crazy prices. I am just not truly impressed."}
{"text":"I gave it a good rating, because I experienced a new flavor today. No one gets five stars from me though

Okay, look, I've been to literally HUNDREDS of Mexican joints in my life. All over the place. Small and cheap shacks, taco trucks, high-end (is there such a thing?) restaurants, etc. This place is average plus, nothing to write-home about. 

Their chips are blah, but the salsa was very tasty, and blended to a good level. I don't like thick n chunky salsa, but blended. Their guac is okay, and the carne de fuego I ordered as my entree was interesting. 

The meat was cooked well, but interestingly, it wasn't spicy. I thought with a name like carne de fuego, it would be hot n spicy. Not the case, as the sauce was quite sweet, actually. 

The new flavor that I experienced here was the creamy sweet potato that was encased in a chile. The chili imparted a spicy flavor onto the sweet potato that I had never experienced before, and for that reason I was happy today. 

But at a $30 plus price point, I feel that I could have gotten an almost-as-good experience at a place like Acapulco for around a third less. I know you think it's lame to compare this to Acapulco, but not really. I give this place a good rating for my unique flavor, the salsa being good, and the layout of the restaurant being excellent, with a separation between main indoor restaurant, outdoor experience, and separate sports bar area."}
{"text":"This place was fabulous.  It was an hour and a half wait but in the meantime we tasted delicious Tequilas and they let us keep the super cool bottle!  
Had the amazing stuffed quesadilla for an appetizer (I mean seriously delish).  Then we headed inside for our main meal.  The cheese tortillas with chive sour cream were delish as well! 
When it came down to the main meal I was way too adventurous for a tex-mex place and ordered the Mexican meat loaf.... eh.  I am sure some would love this but it was definitely smothered with too much chipotle gravy, and the asparagus was, well..... limp.  
No worries though, the service was fabulous for the most part, although a little slow to get our bill out to us but that's fine.   
The place is really fun with a cool vibe and totally worth the semi-expensive cost.  
I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Was there Saturday night and they were busy but we were seated right away. Server took our order quickly but food took a long time to come out. There were two large parties so I'm assuming that is the reason. Our server took pretty good care of us considering he was waiting on a large bachlelorett party also. Food was yummy, the chips and queso were awesome. Nice ambience on patio."}
{"text":"Good customer service, but such a long time for the wait.  Food was dry and bad flavor combination,  I rarely give bad reviews, but for our 13 people bachelor's party, less than half were happy with our food.  It was a busy day, so we believe they waited for all the food to be ready and then brought it all out.  What a weird taste combination and dried meats."}
{"text":"It may be 100-plus degrees outside, but that isn't going to stop me from sitting on one of the prettiest patios in the Valley for dinner. I went to Old Town Tortilla Factory in Old Town Scottsdale, which combines two of my favorite dining elements-a classy atmosphere with tasty Sonoran-influenced food (the menu also has Native American influences, too).

The restaurant is known for its gorgeous outdoor seating, with candlelit tables and twinkly lights decorating pecan trees throughout the patio. It also has a really cool outdoor bar, which serves excellent margaritas-I had a Blue Agave Margarita ($8.50), with Blue Curaco-it was really sweet, which I liked.

I had been there once previously with a big group, and while everything went smoothly then, things this time were a little rougher. Our server, who was busy with several other tables,  didn't write down our order, and the chips and salsa ($4.99) we ordered came after our salads, only after we asked our server what was up.

I got a Tequila Lime Salad ($4.50), which was amazing and would be a great meal in itself (there's also a dinner portion for $8.99). The leafy greens were topped with refreshing pico de gallo and covered in a tequila lime dressing that had the perfect amount of tart to it. It was so good!

I also really liked the yummy handmade tortillas that were delivered to every table, which were accompanied by a really scrumptious butter. I could have had a meal of that alone!

For my entree, I ordered the Green Enchilada, with cheese and tomatillo sauce ($13.99). Even though I specified I didn't want chicken in it, the enchiladas came with chicken in them, and I didn't have time to eat a new order, which I had to take home. It's just a reminder that no matter how uncool it may look, servers should write down orders to get everything out right. Having disappointing service sort of made the beautiful surroundings a little less appealing, but I would probably still go back because the food, when it comes out correctly, is so delicious."}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews are so bad. The salsa for the chips was amazing my mom couldn't stop eating it. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Loved the outdoor patio with the misters. The service was also great"}
{"text":"The food was alright. I've been to better Mexican places.  Drove from Phoenix to come here, but wasn't that amused with the service or food"}
{"text":"Really nice evening. Our waiter, Shane, did an excellent job - good recommendations of appetizers & entrees - queso & chips, carne de Fuego, and red and green enchiladas. Platinum Margaritas were very good (frozen & rocks) but kinda pricey ($12.50). Potato tortillas with Basil butter were unusual but tasty. They don't open til 5:00, so be early as they fill up quickly."}
{"text":"Awesome waitor(can't remember his name), awesome margarita, awesome patio, awesome tortillias, ok main entree(pollo margarita), awesome dessert (banana crisp).  I think that covers it."}
{"text":"Large Mexican restaurant that is famous for their homemade tortillas made fresh daily. The special tortilla of the day is brought out with chips and salsa. Ours happened to be a potato tortilla served piping hot with a garlic and herb butter. To say we couldn't get enough of the tortillas is an understatement. We also devoured their chorizo fondu for our appetizer and would hand down get it again. The margaritas and enchiladas were good but nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Great location in Scottsdale, excellent outdoor seating area. Plenty of patio heaters and room to move. I had the pollo margherita, spendy at $23 and sadly a little bland. Large portion however. My Margarita however was very good and smooth, said to be the best in Phoenix."}
{"text":"so this is 2 star reviewed for the second time in a row. we had a former arizonan in town for the week and she really wanted to go to the Old Town Tortilla Factory so we headed there after a hike up Piestewa.

i can't figure out why my first experience here was so good, but so bad since then. tonight, our service was well below mediocre. we had to wait, and wait, and wait for everything....menu's, the tortilla's, our food, our drinks, our water, the check, etc. 

my wife's salad had cold, overcooked shrimp. our other dinner guest ate only half his carne dish. he even commented that while the margarita's were good, if they put any alcohol in them. 

i love the patio here. i think it's so charming. but 2 times in a row of sub par service and lackluster food pretty much does it for me."}
{"text":"We went to Tortilla Factory on Tuesday, which you would think it would be dead right? WRONG? It was packed! We were told March (because of spring training) is one of their busiest months. This is my first time there!
Our family arrived before my husband and I  (a little before our reservation at 645PM) and they waited about 5 or 10 mins and were sat. When we got there, they were already sat. Trying to get a parking spot is a joke and they do not have valet. We drove around for about 10 minutes until we found a spot, finally in a dark unlit area. That is my main complaint. Their parking lot is soooo tiny, for how large the restaurant is, I was surprised. We were greeted by a young smiling girl (who knew right where our other 4 ppl were at) and brought us to our table outside on the NON smoking patio. That is a huge plus for me. So many spots in AZ. are now allowing smoking on their patios during dinner! YUCK! I dont want to smell someones nasty cigarette OR cigar while eating. I think they might have another patio that is smoking, but not sure (The sign said MAIN patio is non smoking). 
Now for service. Keely was a our waitress who was great. She was friendly and quick at her job. She was slammed and still made us have a good dinner.
My father in law ordered the large sampler thing with nachos, quesidillas and ribs on it. It was decent. The ribs were kind of bland. I didnt try the quesidillas, because I heard they were really spicy. The nachos were underneath everything on the bottom, those were decent. I wasnt too impressed with any of it. I ordered the chips and salsa and it was awesome. I liked it, because it was not spicy and I could eat it, but had great flavor as well. The guys ordered beers and us ladies had non-alcoholic beverages so not sure how their Margs are, but as I could see many people ordered them, so they must be good. Their bar has a million diff. bottles of tequila lined up, so if you are in the mood for tequila, you can prob get anything you want. 
We all ordered the same thing pretty much, two of us got red enchiladas pretty good. Nothing too special, but good. 3 got Build your own tacos, you get shrimp, chicken and steak.. A little weird because you have to pay extra for cheese and sour cream, you get guacamole, lettuce and pico. Dont ALL tacos come with cheese? lol Seemed weird. They all liked it tho. Lots of food that is for sure. The last person got a shrimp salad and she liked it. Almost all the way done with the meal my mother in law said they usually give flavored tortillas as a starter. She asked if they had any? Keely brought out Cilantro maybe? they were bland and had no flavor. I was full anyways, but I wanted to try it. For a company that has the word TORTILLA in their name you would think it would be amazing ya know? It was my father in laws bday so we got some deserts. I was so stuffed didnt even eat half my dinner. I did try some of the cheesecake we ordered it was regular with raspberry drizzle. AMAZING. They also got a piece of choc cake, they said it was great! It looked like it could serve a part y of 10. It was HUGE! All in all, I would give the food a 3 out of 5 stars. BUT Keely was such a great server I had to up it to 4. Keely did tell us that the weekends are crazy busy and there usually is a longer wait, so for people that had a long wait I would advise to go back in during the week. The patio also had a fountain and heaters. It was so nice out there, I could have just sat outside for hours."}
{"text":"Great place to chill on the patio with friends! Loved the patio! Their margaritas ate good and the food was delicious! Good vibes all around here!"}
{"text":"Now this is the meal I've been looking forward to.  Great ambiance, decor, and food!  We started the evening with a margarita with a shot of Grand Marnier, it was a bit light for my taste.  We enjoyed a massive basket of chips with a tomato based salsa, it had nice chunks of onion and jalapeno, perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of salt.  For the main entree, I ordered the green enchiladas.  Presentation was on point.  Three chicken and cheese filled enchiladas topped with spoonful of sour cream took up half the square plate with beans and rice filling in the rest.  Serious flavor points!  

Want a satisfying meal?  Come here.  Want a good margarita?  Go somewhere else.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place for large groups in Scottdale. Food is good but the outdoor patio atmosphere makes it. Definitely would go atain."}
{"text":"It was my first time ther and we went with a group of girls and had a great time the foor was great and it was such a great night to sit on the patio!!"}
{"text":"Brought a group of 16 people to dinner.  For having a big group they did a good job attending to us. Set us up outside real nice set up with lights and nice weather that evening.  
Food was very good, if you like spicy food, this is a good place for it.  Platinum margaritas were delicious, wish the would sell by the pitcher, cause their prices for drinks were a little high.  Margaritas should not be more than $10 dollars for top shelf, unless your seeing 12 oz or more. 
Nice place for a night out and location gives you options to walk and see art gallery and hit many of the other bars in the area."}
{"text":"I'd say a three star review from the Yelp community is pretty accurate. The food isn't anything special. The tortillas are phenomenal, but that's the only culinary win here. 
We were originally headed to Craft 64 next door, and should have gone there because I really wanted some pizza,but the patio here lured us in. It's a LOVELY PATIO, but I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Caution. Do not eat here, this is the worst restaurant I have ever been to in Scottsdale. Save yourself the time and money and go to the heart of Old Town and pick literally any restaurant , and I guarantee it will better. 

First, look at the menu and notice the prices. I'm all for going out and spending $20 or more for an entree but I expect something better than what I would get at chipotle. I ordered the mahi mahi fish tacos. They were horrendous. The portions were small and I still couldn't finish it because it was so bad. The fish was far beyond having some color, it were totally burnt. Absolutely no seasoning and the sauce was bland and strange tasting. The tortillas were clearly store bought. Dry and stale, probably left over from the night before. I have been to Mexico and know what handmade tortillas taste like. I also know what's like to buy tortillas from frys and leave it in the fridge for 3 months. I experienced the latter, big let down since the name of the restaurant implied that they make their own. Drinks were expensive and didn't have more than 1 shot of tequila. Service was slow and didn't even bring chips and salsa out. Total joke."}
{"text":"I am so not a tequila person.  (Long story involving training police officers, shots of Hornitos and throwing up on a room mate).  Point being, even margaritas can be painful for me.  Although I make an exception for this place.  I don't go often (again because of the Tequila issue) but when I do go I go all out.  The food is good, more Richardson's style than say Garcia's mexican style.  The margaritas are huge.  $10.00 for two good pours.  A fun place to go with friends and sit and catch up.  There is generally a long(ish) wait but well worth it.  It's even worth braving the tequila monster."}
{"text":"The food, service, and atmosphere are great, but for the money you can get better elsewhere.  It is a good \"first date\" place or anniversary meal place when you want to talk during your meal - nice and quiet.  I'll probably go back but not frequently.

Try a Tequila Flight!  Very educational and a nice way to sample several tequilas and not get plastered.

They could put just a little pizazz into this place and make it really neat - a \"must do\" activity."}
{"text":"Wonderful environment. Very very pleasant and beautiful location. I loved the homemade jalapeño tortillas. My food was good, especially the rice. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nice patio and large enough for a crowd.  X-mas lights and the water fountain reminds me of the Friends opening credit - Yes, I'll be there for you!

Came here with my gang and it was buffet style but regardless I must rate the place. We had a nice baby green salad with some balsamic vinaigrette, but things went downhill from here fast. Let's start with the pork; Cough! Cough! (Pound the chest!).  Someone pass me some water cause as much as I chewed it didn't go down - It was so dry it soaked up my saliva! Atop of it were some chili flakes so that didn't help much. The stuffed chicken came with a nice creamy sauce, but I don't recall what it tasted like.  The pork overwhelmed me and to add insult to injury don't serve mashed potatoes to dry out my tongue more!

Regardless, a friend of mine made a great point; we are served what we did not order.  Saved!  Therefore, I shall return on another visit to give my full report so stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, service was great, margaritas were great. I had the carne de fuego which was really good. The menu is a limited for vegatarian wife, but she was still happy with experience.

It's interesting to see all of 3 stars and below. There are a lot of really good restaurants in area and foodies in scottsdale, so I wonder if the bar is set ridicously high for some folks..."}
{"text":"Not even going too lie- Love to eat there black bean tortilla's.... They are very good. I had the Pork shank or chops, don't remember-what they call the dish,but they were good. One time it was good and second time, we went was not good at all. Thought it was pricey for the food quality and service received. On the fence, but love the black bean tortilla's... Ha"}
{"text":"Majority of the seating is outdoors, and the night felt pretty nice. I can't imagine what it will be like in 100+ degree weather! LOL. We had a giant party and the staff was exceptional. They had us covered all night.

I ordered the Carne de Fuego which was steak in this spicy and sweet sauce with some sweet potatos stuffed into a pepper. The overall meal was good. I wouldn't say it's the best steak or Mexican food I have eaten. It was ok. 

It's not a bad place to eat. There's definitely better Mexican food and cheaper Mexican food. But for something different, this might be the place."}
{"text":"Our stop was a spontaneous drive by, the place was packed...so we decided to stop in because my sister was in desperate need of her spicy Mexican fix.  The service by Trent was fabulous! My sister offered to marry him for the fish tacos and his extra attention to the side of cabbage.  The  house salsa was incredible, and the banana crisp with raspberries was incredible! Worth the extra 30minutes on a treadmill afterword.  We both had the house chips and salsa w gauc, the fish tacos with sauces to which we had the added shredded cabbage, and we split the banana crisp.  Thank you for a great evening Trent!     - from Ohio"}
{"text":"I'm a little shocked at some of the poor reviews of this place. I've gone twice with the first time being my boyfriend's birthday dinner and the second just a dinner out with friends. I would agree that the service here isn't stellar but nothing horrible enough to write/complain about on a review. 

Pro's: Great patio and indoor atmosphere, great tortillas (I've had the cheddar cheese and red pepper), good food

Con's: Weak margaritas (for the price), limited indoor seating and limited menu

Overall, I had a nice time both experiences and would recommend to others. I would like to go back when the weather is cooler so I can experience the patio."}
{"text":"We came here because it was across from our hotel. I was worried because of the so-so reviews but our experience was really good. We arrived a half hour before closing but were still given amazing service and were in no way rushed at all. Our waiter gave us a sample of the sangria before we ordered it. The food was a little expensive and I thought it was kind of lame that they charge for chips and salsa- especially when \"tortilla\" is in the name of the restaurant. Also- they ran out of the corn tortillas that came with my entree which I wouldn't have noticed if the waiter didn't mention it- but he did so we were kind of laughing about it. They gave me different tortillas so it was fine, and I appreciate him checking with me in case I had an allergy. The food tasted good, perhaps not the most flavorful southwestern food I've ever had but it came out hot and the portions were big. I really liked the green sauce that came with the old town tacos- not sure what it was but I couldn't stop using it. Our waiter was sweet and took pictures of us in the super cute courtyard where we were seated. The ambiance was great for a special night out."}
{"text":"It's not bad and it's not great.  I definately don't think it's worth the price.. But, I get why people go here.  I guess I'm just one of those folks that doesn't need an expensive diner menu to feel that I am getting quality mexican food.  In addition to this, we were starving when we got there, so we wanted some chips and salsa, which we ended up paying for.. Which is fine and all, but I kinda like when those are complimentary..

The tortillas they had the night I was there were potato.  They were delicious.  I could have lived off of them, and the margaritas.  Which, btw, were a great price during happy hour. ($5)  I had an enchilada dish and it was good.  My boyfriend had a pasta dish, and it was also good.  All in all, what we ate was good.  That's all, just good.  If I go back, which I don't know if I will unless someone else suggests it, I'm going to live off the tortillas and margs..

Soo, overall, 5 stars for the tortillas, 4 stars for the margaritas, 3 stars for the service, and 2 stars for the food quality vs. price..."}
{"text":"The food is very delicious, but they will not do separate checks and the waitress was very annoyed when we tried to split the bill."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have to give a star to this place in order to provide a review.

Had the worst restaurant experience, EVER, at this establishment.  The food was a nightmarish mess.  It was so bad it was hysterical!  Service was absolutely 3rd world!  The nerdy waitress had the nerve to overcharge our table $40.  The manager stumbled out bellowing, \"What's your problem now?!\" 

\"FIRST OF ALL, we aren't pleased with the food and the waitress overcharged us.\" I retorted.

\"Well get out, we're closing in 20minutes anyway!\" he snickered.

Long story short --- this place is an overrated outhouse."}
{"text":"Food is better than average Mexican food. The tortillas are excellent: fresh, soft, warm, perfect texture - love them. The patio seating area is great for eating under the stars. Two thumbs up for the atmosphere with lit up trees. Service doesn't quite measure up. Overall reasonable value. With some top notch service to go along with the tortilla and the patio, this place would be a top pick. And ya, parking here sucks."}
{"text":"The outdoor space is really the attraction here.  It's great to sit outside and enjoy the tasteful lights, landscaping, fire pit and a fountain.  Ample seating inside or out. The food was good but a bit pricey, it's not anything authentic."}
{"text":"My roommate and I took his parents here while they were visiting. We were in the mood for Mexican. I couldn't believe I've lived so close to this hidden gem for so long and never knew it was there! The spacious patio area is great. A perfect setting for a date. The food was really good too and came is pretty large portions. We left full. The ONLY reason I did not give 5 stars was because my margarita tasted like it didn't have much alcohol in it. But overall a great experience. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place because it's right next to Hotel Valley Ho, where we are staying. This is a tourist trap full of less than mediocre food. The Carne del fuego or the \"Meat Wreath\" as my wife called it was forgettable. No one brought us the  famous tortillas they seem so proud of, so we can't weigh in on that featured item. They get one extra star because the margaritas weren't too bad although very light on tequila.


Go for drinks, dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came in expecting good food and good service. Waited 10 minutes to just get water. Never came. Totally ignored by the wiaiting staff.   After finding a dead bug on the table, and the plate that was dirty, we decided it was better to just walk out, which is exactly what we did."}
{"text":"We had a huge party last night, and on top of that it was so slammed anyway, Samantha was our waitress and she was so great. Being in the service industry is so hard sometimes and even with how crazy it was and how crazy we all were she was really delightful. Thanks for taking good care of us Samantha!"}
{"text":"We had a group reservation for The Old Town Tortilla Factory, that was great. The problem was that was about all that was great about the place. The credit card machine in the bar was down for the time we were waiting for our table, chips and salsa was $7 and the food was not really good at all. I had asked our waitress about two items and she suggested the restaurants signature dish Pollo Margarita, stuffed chicken breast with chiptole mashed potato cake and seasonal vegetables. The chicken was extremely dry the stuffing was bland and the mashed potato cake was the same bland and dry. The only thing good to eat was the freshly made tortillas."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio...but that is about it.  Went last night and the highlight of my meal was the cheese on the nacho appetizer.  I tried their signature margarita chicken dish...what a disappointment that was....had no taste and wasn't hot."}
{"text":"I like visiting this restaurant every time Im in town. Good food, GREAT margaritas, fun atmosphere. The patio is great and the tortillas are literally hand made right inside, you can watch!"}
{"text":"Pros: The patio dining is beautiful.
Cons: Parking.
Overall: Great dining experience with so-so food.
The restaurant and the environment is wonderful, especially at night.  Eating outside on the patio was pleasant. 

The food was mediocre at best. Tried the Red Chile Pork Chop.  The pork chop is thick cut and grilled perfectly.  The ancho raspberry sauce could use more of the spice and smokiness of the ancho chiles.  The garlic mash potatoes and seasonal vegetables were good, nothing spectacular about them. Tried the Red Snapped as well.  The fish was baked to perfection. It was simple seasoned with salt and pepper and herbs and lemons.  The garlic rice could have used more of a garlic taste.

The staff is friendly and quick. The patio dining very pleasant with a fountain in the middle. The water running from the fountain gave a great ambient sounds.  The only downside is parking.  Their parking lot is small but they do offer a valet but it's not free.  If you're lucky, you may park in the street."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and this restaurant is very accommodating to my food preferences. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and give great service. The margaritas are divine and the ambiance is spectacular."}
{"text":"disappointing. we asked the waitress for suggestions and she provided a couple of suggestions including the \"starred\" pollo margarita. waitress recommendation, star on the menu, highlighted in red.. must be good right?

WRONG. the chicken was dry, the potato cake unimpressive, the seasonal vegetables were okay. this dish was so not very good that my mom who hates wasting food.. refused to help me finish it.  she hardly ever says that she doesn't like a dish, she'll usually just say \"oh its different\" or \"its okay..\" but she was pretty straightforward in expressing her displeasure at this dish.

this place is a bit overpriced, service was just okay and the food... i could have done without..  i don't live in the area, but even if i did, i wouldn't come again.. nice people, just didn't care for anything else.."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and attentive, the food was spicy when it shouldn't be, the menu had very few Mexican food items on it, and it was way over priced. I can pay much less for an authentic Mexican restaurant that serves excellent food. I have no desire to return here."}
{"text":"I'm torn by our experience there. My girl friend and I went to celebrate the evening and the place looks terrific. Let's hit the low notes first-

When the salsa and chips arrived we were shocked at how bland the salsa was. Tasted like it came out of a jar. The chips were boring and tasted and felt like they were made in a factory.  Like maybe in Mexico a few weeks earlier. 
So the name is apt. 
Come on folks this is Arizona get it together with the salsa and chips. 
. 
The enchiladas ( cheese and chicken)  were boring. The sauce tasted like canned Las Palmas. 
The rice was a bit bland also  ( are they cooking for Amish children and Wisconsin wimps?)
The beans however were great. Surprise. 
Now. I have to say the fish entree was totally fabulous. Really great piece of white fish. Plump and juicy and prepared excellently!!
We concentrated on the fish and left the rest pretty much alone. 
The gal who served us was very sweet and made a lot of effort to correct some errors for us. I felt bad that besides the fish the rest of the meals were sub standard. 
Atmosphere and service great. Mexican Food was poor. The fish fillet great!   Good luck!
Too many other great Mexican restaurants around town to bother to go back to this one."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here - tasty green enchiladas and loved their guac.  Homemade tortillas were a huge hit with our table!  Service was great - quick, but not rushed and very attentive.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying I have been wanting to go to this restaurant for quite some time just walking by and seeing the outdoors seating area I finally was able to try this restaurant last night. I had friends in town and we chose this restaurant and was so so so disappointed !!! What a waste!! The only thing that was good was the outside bar the bartender, he was very good,he used our names & gave great service  and the margaritas were good also . The food was such a disappointment!! There was four of us and nobody was happy with their entrées. We ordered the Seabass ,tortilla soup ,stuffed quesadilla,and the nachos. It took for ever to get our food the restaurant was not even busy for a Saturday night about 7 o'clock. Seabass was cold the quesadilla was greasy the tortilla soup was bland the only thing that was semi-good were the nachos but it was also cold. I wanted this place to be good and I was so disappointed it could be so much better."}
{"text":"Dirty, outdated, and dumpy!  Terrible service and the food is nothing to write home about.  We ordered chips and queso, received a basket of tortilla CRUMBS and luke warm dip.  We asked for more chips, but they never came so the dip turned cold and was wasted.  The table actually had dirt on it and the plates were dusty from sitting outside.  It was a huge letdown as we went for my fathers 75th birthday.  Wouldn't recommend this place or go back again!"}
{"text":"Solid 3 star dining experience.  Food is decent.  Not great but ok.  Drinks are good albeit a bit pricey depending on what you order.  The best part about this restaurant is their charming outdoor patio.  Eating under the stars with good decor, ambiance and space heaters in the winter makes for a nice dinner.  As the name alludes, their fresh tortillas are really their signature item.  They comes fresh to your table instead of chips and are served with butter.  They are quite good.  As to the food?  It isn't the best Mexican you will ever have but it isn't bad."}
{"text":"this is my absolute favorite restaurant in Arizona! I love the ambience, the outdoor patio (huge) the menu is diverse and outstanding!  The wait staff is top notch! and the food is incredible!  I always bring out of town guests here, for a special dinner!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with some friends.  Very disappointed in food and margaritas.  Food bland not much flavor man someone needs to use salt and pepper in this restaurants kitchen!  Mahi Mahi tacos smelly and not fresh.  Green pork chile more potatoes than pork and very runny just in a broth.  Crab dip bad... rubber crab texture and bland like most items on this unseasoned menu !"}
{"text":"We used a deal chicken which was a very good value as the menu items vary from 15-33 dollars.  Rather expensive for a Mexican restaurant.  We had a wonderful reception when we arrived. We were greeted by two different people.  Seating was timely and very pleasant.  Our waiter came immediately to our tables, got us started on our Margaritas and brought the included Fundido appetizer which was very good.  Contrary to other reviewers we did get a basket of chips and salsa as well as fresh tortillas within a few minutes of being seated.  The Margaritas are big and really good.  Again, to get 2 each was a great deal.  Our waiter, Trent, was very pleasant, efficient and nice.  No bad attitude about the deal chicken voucher.  I had the taco plate, shrimp, beef and chicken served with beans, rice and 3 more tortillas.  Good but a lot to eat!  My daughter had a spicy chicken dish, she really liked it but, like me, said it was too much food.  It seems the reviews here are based on the poor service as opposed to the quality of food but I have to give the establishment 5 stars because I can't fault to service in the least.  They really went out of their way to make sure we had a good time.  We sat inside, too hot outside, but there were 20 or more people enjoying the evening on the beautiful patio under the mister system.  Would I go back?  Yes, with a deal chicken.  Had we paid full price the dinner would have been over $100 total  including the drinks which to me is too pricy for a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  Because I live on the east coast I only go here once a year, but everytime I go the food is excellent and the service is good, too.  The meatloaf, salad, enchiladas are top notch.  As is the atmosphere.

I know I'm in the minority, but this is one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"As far as the food goes it didn't seem to be the traditional Mexican type of food that I'm used to I had the chicken enchiladas and the sauce was not very good. But the fried banana dessert was excellent.

Seems to be a very popular place that you would need to make reservations for which we did the ambience is beautiful. 

Service was great. But if you're going for good Mexican food and you might want to go someplace else."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife for a nice dinner while we were staying at the Valley Ho next door for the night and the food was inedible.  We were seated at a table right next to the bathroom, even though the restaurant was completely empty.  Our server took over 10 minutes to even come over and offer drinks/water.  The water arrived in dirty plastic cups and the water looked kinda brown, so we didn't drink it.  She took our order and brought us some of their \"famous\" homemade tortillas.  Wow were they bad.  And by bad, I mean they were the worst tortillas I have ever had the misfortune of putting into my mouth.  It was pretty surprising how bad they were since it is the \"tortilla factory\", they should know better.  When our main courses arrived, they looked ok, but tasted awful.  I had a steak and my wife had shrimp tacos.  The steak was over cooked and rubbery, while my wife's tacos were unfortunately served in those same disgusting tortillas.  Even the shrimp and other toppings in her taco were not just bland, but tasted really bad.  I got about 2-3 bites into my steak and her trying her tacos and then we looked at each other in utter shock.  We decided we were going to leave, as we were really hungry and couldn't eat these inedible creations.  We tried to flag down our waitress to get a bill so we could pay and leave, but she was no where to be found.  We did some math and figured out what our tab would be with tax and tip, left the cash, and quickly exited.  Thankfully, Valley Ho's room service, while not amazing, was at least edible.  We will not be going back here, ever!"}
{"text":"A group of friends and I tried here too on Saturday.  The margaritas were fantastic, but the food was so-so for everyone at the table.  The setting is really unique and fun to hang around.  I would go to the Tortilla Factory again...as long as we were just going for drinks and atmosphere - not for food."}
{"text":"3 stars might be generous when it comes to the food, but the service was a solid 4 stars and the atmosphere and drinks are 5 star which is what made me bump this up to a 3. 

Living in North Scottsdale, I don't venture down to old town very often, but when I do it's to try a new place to eat. I've heard a mix of things about this place and decided to try it out with a couple of friends. As I stated above, the service and ambience are great, as are the margaritas! 

Chips and salsa are not standard, they'll set you back an extra $6, but they do have what I gathered to be a \"tortilla of the day\" type situation and that's given freely and in a generous portion!

Let's get to the meat and potatoes of my issue (literally), myself and one other person ordered the Sonoran Meatloaf, which on the menu sounds phenomenal. The plates arrived and looked very nice, though the bacon that's wrapped around it was burnt to a crisp, literally black and bitter. I didn't mind and peeled it away from my meatloaf and started in on the asparagus, sadly it was over cooked and under seasoned, lacking any true flavor and being limo and borderline mushy at the top, but woody and tough at the bottom. No matter I told myself, the meatloaf and mashed potatoes looked delicious...LOOKED, but sadly they too were a disappointment. The meatloaf was very mushy, which commonly happens when there is too much filler (eggs or bread crumbs), the mashed potatoes were basically glue and the theme continued of a lack of seasoning! Normally I'll season food myself at the table (which never can save a dish, but at least helps) but they had no seasoning on the table, no salt or pepper. I can understand this in a restaurant of a certain caliber, when the chef has a deft hand with seasoning and additional flavor as an after thought aren't needed. 

The other person at our table got the tacos platter, I was impressed with the assortment of protein (shrimp, steak and chicken) he was slightly disappointed that it was served fajitas style instead of crispy tacos. He did eat them and said that the dish was alright! 

Overall if you're down for a cozy little place with a huge outdoor patio and tasty drinks, this is your place. If you are like me and look for those plus a great culinary experience, you'll leave a little disappointed."}
{"text":"My family and I came to Scottsdale for vacation and went to the Tortilla factory for our first  meal. I'll start by saying that my 19 year old daughter liked her enchiladas. We also chose to pay the $6 for chips and salsa ($6! Really?). The salsa was really good. As other reviews have said, they serve you tortillas with a yummy butter of some sort. I'd rather have chips and salsa. My husband and I both got the Old town taco plate with all three, steak, chicken and shrimp. I liked the shrimp, the steak was just OK and the chicken was dry. Our waiter was very nice and the patio was beautiful but that's the most I thought it had going for it."}
{"text":"This place is always worth the wait.  The atmosphere is unique and the food is excellent.  Be patient! 

On both occasions I've dined here we passed the time with drinks and appetizers at the bar.  If you sit inside for pre-dinner libations, bring a sweater--the a/c is cranked up and it gets quite chilly.  

After finding a table at the bar we had to wait for our [nonexistent] waitress to come take our drink orders...but the Tortilla Factory redeemed themselves.  Our drinks came out in record time, as did our crab dip.  I wasn't impressed with this dish--definitely not what I was expecting crab dip to be.  Definitely ask for extra chips and salsa (and some hot sauce...the salsa isn't spicy at all).   The waitress later came by to apologize; the poor girl was running around servicing over 15 tables by herself!  

The 90 minutes quickly passed and we were soon seated on the expansive patio.  It's so intimate and the service is friendly and prompt.  I had the shrimp salad.  The prawns were huge and tender--charred to perfection.  The greens were crisp and plentiful.  The cilantro dressing was AMAZING.  Just the right amount of food. 

This is one of my favorite restaurants in town because of the unique touches: fresh, house-made tortillas with garlic butter...candlelit dining...a fountain with blazing fire...delicious food...AND unpretentious people!  Definitely a world of its own. 

If you're in Scottsdale, you MUST visit this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this restaurant is great; there are smaller, more intimate dining rooms inside, and a gorgeous patio with a fountain. I had an original and a peach margarita--both were good, although they could have been stronger. Before the meal came, the server brought homemade spinach tortillas and cheese butter. Amazing! The tortillas were soft and delicious and the cheese butter went very well with the spinach tortillas. For my entree, I had the Red Enchiladas, and all I can say is, HOLY CILANTRO, Batman! Unfortunately, the main flavor I tasted was cilantro, and I can't stand cilantro. A person who isn't as adverse to this flavor may have no issue, but I did. The corn tortillas that were used for the enchiladas were fantastic--I just wish I had a better idea of what the red sauce tastes like, but the overpowering cilantro prevented that..."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to come out for a large dinner and here is a break down of that experience:
1 star for the location, it has great outdoor seating and a really comfortable patio
1 star for the food, it was a large self serve style because we had a special group event, but it was delicious
1 star for the service, kind of sort of, some of the servers were great and some were not so great"}
{"text":"This is such a fun place to be! Best Margarita in town!!

We arrived with reservation but still had to wait, which I'm usually not a fan of.  But oh well, margarita will keep me busy for awhile.  We walked into the bar room, then someone came up and said that we can take the high table if we wanted to and order meals there. Yes! we don't mind to be seated early at all!  

We sat outside in the patio near the fountain, the outdoor is just so lovely with the sound of falling water and all the lights up between the trees and across the patio.  

The food was fairly good, with a bit commercialized flavor, meaning, it's not your home-made heartful type of mexican food.  I had quesadilla so it couldn't really go wrong.  But the portions were gianormous!!  We couldn't finish what we had and took the rest home.

Go there for the atmosphere! It's really fun!

{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever visited. Chorizo Fundido was so creamy and delicious! Yummy sea bass. Husband loved the Sonoran meatloaf. Have an iced Treasure Margarita. Dana is a fantastic waiter! Going back again tonight! Sit outside in the patio! Heaters if you get cold. Barratt Jackson visitors need to dine here!!!"}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant to bring my brother-in-law and his wife here based on the reviews I've read.  I agree that the food is not top-notch Mexican...if that is what you are looking for, pass it by.  However, for our occasion, it was perfect.  Lovely patio atmosphere in Old Town, the service was quite good and we were able to have a very relaxing dinner.  We went at 6:30 on a Saturday night, and there was no wait for a patio table.  I give the menu some points for trying to be inventive - I had the Pollo Margarita, as did my partner, and it was fine, but I understand why people criticize the food for being a bit on the bland side.  My brother in law had the meatloaf with chipotle sauce (he's the culinary guy in the group) and he was quite pleased with it.  SIL had the red enchiladas, and while not her favorite, she said they were good.  My partner and his brother were raised on homemade tortillas, so they were not impressed with the tortillas here, although they are house made and I thought very good, as a gringo.  So yes, three stars for a perfectly good place, but if they stepped the food up a notch, I would go the extra star."}
{"text":"Order appetizers and set outside.  The waitress was very helpful.  The food was alright.  I did enjoy the specially made tortillas and the spread."}
{"text":"First of all if you want to eat a decent Mexican food do not come here. Seriously. You can find better and cheaper places close by. The food in general is below average but there is something about the place that makes us keep coming back. The atmosphere outdoor is magical at night. The service is efficient and friendly. The complimentary tortilla is freshly made and they have different flavors every day. The quacamole is delicious. I love it. Well no, not just love it. LOVE IT. The place is perfect for group events or celebrations. You will have fun and a good evening if you try it. Unless you want authentic, tasty Mexican food."}
{"text":"Yum I love the food! The building is nice, its a little expensive, but I went with my sister who knew exactly what to order. We split an appetizer, entree, and both had great margaritas! If there's a huge wait, go early to miss the rush.
I can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"Food is great, and patio is very nice.  So many reviews that are poor for no reasonable reason.  Probably these are people that like Ajo Al's hehhehe.  Fish Tacos were tasty, fundido was awesome.  My kids devoured it."}
{"text":"After reading about this restaurant featured in a Phoenix Travel magazine for its patio dining, my hubby & I decided to give it a shot.  The wait was long, the servers were nice, the place was super busy and the patio was beautiful  (Minus the really cheap plastic patio chairs).

It was nice to wander the local art galleries during our wait time.

Food was decent.  I have no complaints, but I found myself wondering if any of the other patios that we'd past, may have had better more unforgettable foods on the menu.  Oh well.

P.S.  I didn't realize they were going to automatically bring tortillas to the table so I made the mistake of ordering chips & salsa.  NOT necessary unless you want to stuff yourself before your meal :)"}
{"text":"Not bad.  This place came up in a Yelp search for Mexican but I'm not sure I'd call it a Mexican restaurant.  Food was good, however, and different.  

I had the Pollo Margarita and really enjoyed it, especially all veggies."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, both were very different experiences. First time ain't half bad, the second time was pretty awful. 

The first time I came here was for a rehearsal dinner (something I learned they are well known for) and had a great time. We sat outside on the patio and it had a very relaxed feel to it. The food was good and they kept the margarita's coming. 

I went here last week and had a really blah experience. I grew up in Tucson so I am used to fantastic Mexican restaurants, and I was wrong to assume that this was in the same boat. I like when menus are five pages long, there are combo plates, rice and beans come with every entree, and chips and salsa are given (not ordered) and continually refreshed as soon as you finish the bowl. Old Town Tortilla Factory had none of those, on top of the fact that there was only one vegetarian option on the entire menu. I ordered the chicken enchiladas (minus chicken, meaning just cheese) and they were not great; they actually had a sour/tart taste to them. 

Our server was also not-so-great, he was MIA for the majority of the meal which made it difficult to get refills, condiments, and our check. Also, it was kind of pricey, especially since the quality was pretty low. 

I will say this, their order of guacamole is large and in charge (about 3 avocados worth) and pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Wow, each time I come here and not by choice but usually for someone's b-day they want to come here and I am hoping for them to grow up and actually buy fresh food to cook and not frozen. I have tried something different each year over the years and it never impresses or even makes me feel that was ok. I'm not expecting a fine dinning experience but Sad that a local company can't just do what's right. On a good note the staff was nice but the food continues to not be good. This is the last time I come here."}
{"text":"Eh...
We keep coming back when we visit Scottsdale, looking for a better experience, I think. Nice outside patio. Nice service. Food is ....eh...

Chips were stale. Tortilla soup was barely warm and tortilla strips in soup were stale.

Traditional red and green chicken enchiladas were mediocre and also not hot.

Homemade blank bean tortillas were yummy.

Ice cream dessert was icy and tasted old and frost-bitten. 

I don't think we will be coming back. Too many great options in Scottsdale. Such a bummer."}
{"text":"DO NOT TRY THE BLACK BEAN TORTILLAS!  Horrible! Service was the best thing about this restaurant.  I was very disappointed as I have been wanting to eat here for years. Again, disappointing..."}
{"text":"This place does not even deserve a star. Upon arrival get handed a pager with half of the restaurant empty. We still had to wait 20 minutes for a table. Tired of waiting asked I we could eat at the bar, was told no as a dinner plate goes to a couple at the bar. We finally get seated, starving thinking okay chips and salsa... wrong that's an appetizer that is 4 bucks. So we order what ended being a basket of stale chips and some fondidto (melted cheese). Well after the third attempt of serving the cheese actually warm enough to eat, it sucked. I am waiting for my entree as I write this only for the entertainment of how horrible this is going to be. Should of gone to Oregano's"}
{"text":"We have been to hundreds of Mexican food places across the southwest and this was one of the worst. The chips were cold and a bit stale. The salsa was way to tomatoey with little spice. The guacamole was ok. 
The food came out barely warm. This is sin for Mexican.  
Most everything was on the bland side and appeared to be not freshly prepared. The specialty tortillas were flour not corn. Wake up! Corn has flavor. 
The frozen margaritas were pretty good. The food portions were large. The building and grounds were ok. 
The service was nice. 
I think they microwave a bunch of the items. And don't make them from scratch. Pretty much a poser tourist ripoff. But you could suspect that given the location."}
{"text":"One star because zero wasn't an option. I can't believe a place like this is in business. I've never had such bad food at a restaurant. 

The service was fine, but the food was just SO BAD. I mean, slop-grade food.  We had the green enchiladas which can only be described as decent chicken wrapped in soggy tortillas. Only suitable for people who don't have tastebuds. We also had the meatloaf which looked like dog food and tasted like cafeteria food. 

The only explanation for this restaurant is that they're making the worst food possible to get bad Yelp reviews on purpose."}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place has such bad reviews! There are so many good things about this place! 

My co-worker suggested that I go here when traveling to Scottsdale for work. He really insisted. Then my other co-worker seperately decided to take me here because \"it is the best Mexican food ever\". He even claimed it is better than San Diego's Mexican, which I cannot agree with ;)

So, we went before I checked Yelp.... The patio is GORGEOUS. I took pictures, it was like a fairy tale land. The waitress was on top of it! Everything she suggested was awesome. We got the margarita that she said was the least sweet and oooh let me tell you, it was Uh-Mazing! She suggested the queso dip and that was another winner with nice big pieces of bean and tomato. I had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. if you like enchiladas GO FOR IT!!! So Good.

One thing I will say is that it is a little pricey. Work was paying for it but I definitely wouldn't have gone all out like we did if I had to pay, call me cheap... whatever... hatas gonna hate!

And the dessert was... eh... ok. the deep fried banana... wish I woulda got the flan or cheesecake."}
{"text":"YUMMY!
Pretty sweet and simple. I haven't had the opportunity to dine in, but I hear the ambiance is great. We generally do take out when we work late nights, and the food hasn't disappointed me yet. 

The Nachos del Sol is great..
Tortilla chips topped with chorizo, pepperjack cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole,chipotle sour cream & jalapeno peppers with house salsa. (not appropriate for those sensitive to heartburn) 

A healthier approach would be  the Tequila lime salad with grilled chicken. The dressing is a great touch and the flavors just mix well w/ the chicken and greens.

Last but not least- you must try the Chicken Tortilla soup. Thick, and sooo good with the touch of avocado and sour cream. 

So next time you're looking for a different touch for take out- you should try Old Town Tortilla Factory"}
{"text":"OK, the patio is great - fun drinks and lively place.  I would give the food an average rating though.  Not bad but not great.   I would go for some nachos and tortillas and enjoy a marg on the patio on a lovely evening."}
{"text":"Decent food.  Had the poblano de mariscos - stuffed pepper with creamy / crab meat filling.  very rich.

Homemade tortillas were good, but not as wonderful as I remember from last September.

Great atmosphere.

Service was a tad slow."}
{"text":"Dinner on the patio last night with some live music. The complimentary tortillas last night were spinach with rosemary butter - they were fresh and flavorful. Since it was hot out I opted for a salad - el torsora del mar - the shrimp had nice glaze and the dressing tied in perfect! Celebrated a friends birthday and she received a complimentary dessert which we all shared."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere, but adequate service and very inflated prices."}
{"text":"Best patio in Old Town and extensive tequila list."}
{"text":"Underwhelming.  First time back in 5 years or so and I was looking forward to eating here.  We had such a nice experience the first time.  We went on a Friday night, kind of late, around 7:45pm.  We were seated right away, outside on the patio, which is nice.  Good margaritas.  But, the service and the food, um, not so much.  We were really pushed, being served our soup before our appetizer and our entree while we were still eating our appetizer.  Also, the food, which we liked so much has really dropped off.  The pasta my daughter had was very oily.  My pollo margarita was dry and almost tasteless.  My son-in-law's ribs were good, but not outstanding.  Overall, a disappointment."}
{"text":"Great ambience, but mediocre food. Loved the outside dining with the exception of the party one table over who had 8 disconnected adults with 10 unruly, ill behaved children between 5-10 years of age. (Our 8 year old was glad when they left!) Loved eating underneath the light strung trees in the courtyard of this old home turned restaurant. The freshly prepared tortillas served before our meal were delicious, but that was where it ended for me. I prefer bold flavored Mexican and this was bland . . . My husband tried the ribs and the sauce was basically like a tomato sauce with very little flavor. Our daughter insisted on chocolate cake for dessert, which had been obviously frozen and in turn dried out. Our waitress was excellent; although, extremely busy with numerous tables so some things took her a little longer to deliver on requests. Perhaps if you are just going for drinks and apps, this could be a fun place!"}
{"text":"Decent place. Good device, the Red Snapper was wonderful. The bathrooms were disgusting."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor seating, which looks particularly neat at night time. The food is incredibly bland. The prices are unreasonable for the portions and quality of food. After living in the area for 3 years, we only happened to go there due to a time crunch. Certainly no intention to return."}
{"text":"To put it straight, our server was awkward. We were a group of four chicks, so I'm not sure if he was nervous or what... but there was some definite strangeness going on.

The crab dip is pretty bomb if you like big chunks of avocado... Which I do... Mmmmm.. Also had the green Chile enchilada is super delish. Supposedly it's a spicy dish but I'm super anti-spice and I didn't notice it.

The super awesome bigass patio is pretty cool, especially with all the romantic lighting. This COULD potentially be an excellent spot to just chill and have a drink with your buds, but we were surprised to be told at 10pm that it was time to close down shop. :P"}
{"text":"The service was borderline poor surpassed only by several of our entrees brought to us cold. When we asked for our food to please be reheated the entrees came back cold for the second time. Two soups were switched when served and upon my friends realizing the error (one had chicken and one did not) the waiter asked them if they could please trade with each other after they had eaten a few spoonfuls. Yuck! I was very disappointed in our overall experience and will not be back."}
{"text":"Service was good, the location is great and patio is awesome but the food quality and execution was unacceptable.  We ordered the chorizo queso fundido appetizer. The cheese was cold and the meat was not chorizo. They only have mango ice tea? What Mexican food restaurant doesn't have regular ice tea. My meal had rice and black beans. Rice was terrible and the black beans had no flavor. Mexican food is my favorite and I eat it all he time and I'm from Southern CA so I know good Mexican food. I wasn't expecting amazing but...There are many quick service restaurants that have much higher quality food and standards. Considering the location this place has the opportunity to do great. The menu prices I way over priced especially for the quality and execution."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with family while visiting Phoenix. The service was outstanding. The house made tortillas were yummy and the queso fundito was fantastic. Most importantly, the margaritas are made with fresh citrus. Would definitely go back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Cute outdoor space especially with all the decoration for the holidays. They have heat warmers which was a plus for my friend. 

The service was good, they were not as busy since we had late dinner. I ordered the beef, shrimp, chicken combo. However I didn't get the chicken, requested for just beef and shrimp and classic margarita.

They provide homemade tortilla with strawberry butter for the table. Which I thought it was weird but ended up being good.  When you order the margarita it comes with the shaker so you can refill your own glass. My dish was good but wow it was a big portion you can share. You will need to ask for extra tortillas. 

Overall good last outing with my friends before returning home."}
{"text":"It was a very nice scenery. The heater out side wasn't working properly so me and my wife went inside. There wasn't a long wait for our food because the waitress Samantha J was on top of her game. She was really friendly and fast. Food was cool me and my wife liked it."}
{"text":"My hubby and I are fairly new to the Scottsdale area and on the hunt for a good Mexican food restaurant.  We stopped in here because it had a nice patio area, but the menu prices were high.  We ordered chips & salsa and guacamole to start.  After reading the mediocre reviews on Yelp, we decided that this place was way over priced for what the offer.  Our chips & salsa and guacamole cost us over $11.00, (not including the tip). The guacamole came in a very small bowl and wasn't all that great...definitely not worth the more than $5 we paid for it.  We have opted to spend our hard earned money elsewhere.  BTW - where I come from, good Mexican restaurants don't charge for chips & salsa..."}
{"text":"I love the restaurant....but just tonight went to the bar for a cocktail and some food. The ambiance is great! It's like a little green room. You feel like your outside but you're in the cool AC which is important in AZ during the summer. The reason for my 2 rating? The bartender. What a jerk!! He was a know-it-all and had no interest in providing good service. I'll come back to the restaurant but not the bar. It's unfortunate."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Just gorgeous decor and atmosphere. My tortilla soup was ok, but for the price you do get a lot of it. The house salad was good, and it looked like the street tacos were the hit of our table."}
{"text":"We had a group of 3 couples. Two of us had the Deal Chicken coupon, $49 for $117.00. Our coupon gave us the tortilla chips with the salsa and fundido and two margaritas for each person. I thought for sure that after drinking the margaritas I would turn red from drinking all that alcohol. That's because I'm allergic to something in the alcohol whether it be beer, wine or the hard stuff. NOT!! These drinks were watered down.
Average price for their margaritas came to $11.20. Maybe if we paid full price for our meals, it would have been much better.

My wife had the Pollo Margarita, stuffed chicken breast . which was a lot of food for her. She brought half of it home. I ordered the Grilled Salmon which was so GOOD that I cleaned the plate. 

The next order was for dessert which I had the Flan and my wife had the Tuxedo cheesecake.

The service was excellent. maybe because the table we were at was reserved for 8:00. Our server. Samantha, was very knowledgeable and personable. She was on top of everything; water glasses were constantly filled and she would make sure all the finished plates were removed."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the food here as well as the atmophere outside.  The crab dip was a little bland, but overall the food here is excellent. My friends got a variety of dishes inlcuding a delicous plate of pasta, and the sea bass and both were amazing. I absolutely loved my food and always enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"Food ok we ordered the pork chops the menus said that they were 10oz I worked in the meat business for many years the pork chops we got were closer to 6 oz"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place .. super chill atmosphere and there tortillas ..  Amazing, I highly recommend this place the food is great and the over all vibe is very cool"}
{"text":"Well,
My wife got a deal on Deal Chicken for an app, 2 entrees, and 4 margaritas, and dessert for $44 (supposed value $110). I thought is was a great deal, but there were some problems with the food and ambiance. The food was bland across the board. the app we got with the deal was chorizo fundido (not much flavor) and the chips/salsa need some work. The salsa tasted like tomato puree from a can, and my entree (Pollo Margarita) had a great presentation, but the meat was dry and the \"Chipotle\" mash potatoes tasted like paste. My wife (Vegetarian) opted for the Penne con Pollo (without the chicken). The dish describes veggies in the pasta, but little was seen. The drinks were ok, but tasted like Sprite was added to the margaritas. We had enough of the food and got the cake to go, which actually was the best part we ate the next day.
It was 100 degrees that night, and we ate inside....SUFFER and eat outside...the ambiance is much better (fountain and lights) than inside (dim and plain). The service was great (the reason for 2 stars)!!!! But too bad the food/drinks couldn't match :(.

I felt the experience wasn't worth the $44, and could've got better tex/mex at a hole in the wall place somewhere else in Scottsdale.

Look at the magazine covers they have framed, about \"how good the Tortilla Factory is\"...they're all from 2002-2006...TIME TO UPDATE TORTILLA FACTORY!"}
{"text":"While the location and the outdoor area is awesome...everything else is consistently inconsistent.  During some visits the staff is great, however other visits they are LITERALLY non-existent and you have to go find them.  During some visits, the food will be some of the best you can get in the valley, however, other visits it is extremely disappointing and just bad.  I really want to see this place do well, however, I am not sure how much more I will consistently think about coming back."}
{"text":"We went here last night after more highly rated Yelp places nearby were completely empty.  It was a slow night for dining out although the weather was fantastic.  We saw this place and loved the outdoor seating.   

Service was terrific.  Our waitress was very honest about the menu and what she liked and didn't like. When I asked her opinion about an appetizer, she said not to get it but to have chips and salsa instead.

As for the meal, I took her feedback and ordered the grilled mahi mahi tacos. They were small but I am not a big portion eater.  Probably better as an appetizer for most people. They were FANTASTIC.  Best fish tacos I've had in a long time. Loved it was a small size and I sometimes hate eating at Mexican restaurants with huge portions.

Chicken Margarita was also great which was a waitress pick.  Red enchiladas had a lot of sauce (almost mole) and were just okay.  That person in the group wished she listened to the waitress.

Margaritas were all tasty, too.  We all will return when we are back in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews here and some were fairly harsh but others were positive so we thought we'd give it a try. We were pleasantly surprised! We knew we would pay for chips and salsa so that wasn't a big deal and the basket of chips was huge. The salsa was good but I wanted it with a little more spice so I asked Sydney, our server, if they had anything with a little more kick. She brought out some habanero sauce and I just added it to the pico de gallo.... just right and good flavor! When we chose our entree I asked Sydney for a few suggestions and she was spot on.. our food was flavorful and delicious. The service was terrific ( we split a margarita to start our meal and she brought out 2 frosty glasses so we'd each have our glass) we had ordered a beer to go with our meal and they arrived just as they served our entree. Enjoyed the experience and would go back!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of crowdsourcing, but in practice it has some flaws; namely, no filter often equals skewed and even poor input. Dinner last evening was a great example. 

Yelpers haven't been entirely complementary towards this establishment, but the group we had been working with had suggested this place for dinner, and my friend was interested in the homemade tortillas, so with my Yelp apprehension in hand, off we went.

It was a beautiful February evening, and having just come from Colorado, how could I not sit on the patio. They had plenty of heaters to take the edge off of cool, but they weren't needed last night. I need to take a quick back step though. When we arrived, the street and the parking lot were full, and there was an additional pay lot across the street. I figured this place must be packed, but we risked it and were pleasantly surprised how much room there was! I was very happy we could get in, but did wonder if the place was full, how it could impact service. 

We had a very pleasant waitress who answered all of our questions about the menu and ingredients. (My friend is allergic to tomatoes so Mexican can be a challenge). We also briefly discussed the silly Yelp complaints about having to pay for chips and salsa. Just because some places offer chips and salsa does not mean every Mexican restaurant must. More to the point, this place has complementary freshly made tortillas and chipotle butter. Last night they were spinach tortillas. I am not a flour tortillas guy as I find they often have a slight raw flour taste to them, and these were no exception. I was only able to eat like 6 of them (hey, that chipotle butter is great)!

I began with a Caesar salad. Not the quintessential Mexican starter, but they added jicama and red peppers. I didn't take a picture but unless you feel the need to really graze, the small salad was much larger than any dinner or side salad I have had before. The lettuce and other veggies were very fresh and crunchy as were the croutons.

It is interesting how much Yelp reviews can impact my menu selections. I like to put thought and time into my reviews, therefore I often find myself hesitating ordering something because of a Yelp comment. Last night I considered ordering the pork Verde, but because I had read a review that described it as watery any lacking pork, I crossed it off the short list and went with the red chili pork chop. Wow! If you are a pork fan at all, don't pass this up. It consisted of two grilled, bone-in chops (see the picture). They were done just how I like pork chops, juicy in the middle, a bit more done along the edges, and just a little suet to add the porky flavor. The red chili was very flavorful and had a bit of heat.

This is a good time to address spices and Mexican food, as several people felt the need to say the food here was not spicy, and even bland. \"Hey World, Mexican food doesn't have to, (nor should it) burn the roof of your mouth. You are confusing it with Tex-Mex.\" Nuff said.

If I had any critique, besides the slightly raw-flower taste to some of the tortillas, would be the too subtle garlic in the potatoes. I know I risk the same critique as I leveled above, but I will rationalize it by saying that I think it is okay to take liberal advantage of a named dish element. Ok, indefensible. 

Some odds and ends. 1) They split our ticket even though the menu says won't. 2) They gave my friend several chipotle butter cups to take home. 3) Every single wait person (4) I chatted with were friendly and engaging. In fact, they initiated the short conversations. 

So five stars because the evening began with pleasant weather and ended with two very satisfied customers."}
{"text":"wonderful atmosphere, fun place great food, awesome drinks will absolutely have a return engagement!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Mexican food place! Got chips and salsa for a starter and had red enchiladas for the entree. Pretty good service, nothing crazy good about the service or food. I wouldn't mind coming back here again, although I'll keep searching for the best Mexican restaurant in town! Can't really complain!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Some of these reviews absolutely floor me.  How can there be THIS much difference of opinion?

I just got back from a weeklong vacation with the family in Scottsdale, AZ and while looking for places to eat my wife had jotted down the \"Old Town Tortilla Factory\" on her pre-trip search.  She said the Food Network had them listed as some of the best Margaritas around.  So last Tuesday we stopped by for a few and some appetizers.  The kids ordered their non-alcholic cherry margaritas (on the kids menu) and some nachos. My wife, mother-in-law and I all ordered different Margaritas to compare.  We planned on getting the \"Million Dollar Margarita\" (well reviewed), but at $20 it just seemed steep.  But we were all raving about the Treasure Margarita.  Definately two thumbs up.  We also  some appetizers - \"Nachos Del Sol\" which is loaded with jalapenos, chorizo, pepperjack cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole and probably a few more things I can't remember. It had a kick to it, which I liked..... the small order was pretty well sized.  My wife & mother-in-law ordered the \"Plato Apertivo\" which was kind of like an appertizer sampler (ribs, Santa Fe rolls, nachos, quesadillas, etc).  They enjoyed that.   The Tortillas however, were OK.  they offer different kinds depending on what's the special of the day.  When we went it was Black Bean.  They were fresh and served with a dried tomato butter.  Interesting.  

Overall we had a great experience.  Good, friendly & prompt service and it wasn't crowded at all.  So good in fact that we went back for dinner on Friday night.  This time we went light on appetizers and ordered full meals.  I have to absolutely RAVE about the \"Poblano de Mariscos\" - it was two nicely sized poblano peppers, roasted and stuffed with a crab, cheese, roasted corn, red pepper stuffing over rice with a shrimp cream sauce.  It was AWESOME.  As good as a similar dish I like to get in a small restaurant I like in Cabo San Lucas.

My wife ordered the Achiote Ribs and my mother-in-law got the Pork Chile Verde.  All seemed quite happy with it.  My sister-in-law got the Penne con Pollo which she quite liked. The kids on the other hand, got orders of Mac 'n Cheese.  Hey, they're kids.

Overall I really liked this place and would definately go back again the next time I visit Scottsdale.  It beats the ever underwhelming, overpriced Cheesecale Factory or similar chains."}
{"text":"Was expecting more after a friend suggested this place while we were on a trip. The food was nothing special. They only serve black beans as well. A plus was the specialty tortillas and butter they bring out before your meal. The atmosphere is pretty neat and the outside patio looks like a nice hangout spot. Overall, I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Old Town Tortilla Factory is located in Old Town Scottsdale in the art district. It a historic 75-year old adobe home so it's as pretty on the inside and out!

They have an outdoor patio that is surrounded by 100 year old pecan trees. The patio is heated in the winter and in the summer months the patio is cooled with misters. You can also go inside by their fireplace for a warm atmosphere during your meal!

It's great for lunch and dinner dates or go during the night life for some drinks and music! 

I love any of their margaritas and any food item has been so yummy! (Not a fan of their tortilla soup though). My favorite is the queso dip with chips for an appetizer. I'll get it every time."}
{"text":"Thank goodness I used living social and only had to pay 47% for lack luster food and mediocre service."}
{"text":"2 people $70+ for $12.00 worth of food given the quality.  (and $12 is pushing it)

The patio is very nice and I think would be both fun and fine for drinks, chips, guacamole, and salsa.  The Salsa is quite good.  If your planning to eat, go elsewhere!

However, that's about where it ends from our experience.  Tortilla factory's food didn't rate on par with even some of the taco carts around town (some of which are actually quite good, so it's probably in insult to the carts to compare them with this place).  

We ordered the mole ribs.  The mole was not traditional and was very bad; ribs were dried out and cold.  I think maybe they made the mole early in the day, and then held it around.  The taste was sour, burnt, and harsh.  Not the subtle spice and flavor of a good mole.

We then went on to have several main dishes.. one of which was the green pork Chile Verde.  The presentation was awful and the dish looked washed out and very bad.   Think Alpo.   The flavors of the sauce as good but, the meat was dry and tough.

The other dish we had was a sweet honey steak dish.  The flavor was fair, presentation was decent however.

Overall, I'd have to say I felt sorry for the servers and anyone going here thinking that they are getting a taste of local fare.   Sadly, the food is a very poor representation of the city and its diverse southwestern/Mexican culture.

This restaurant has such potential due to its location, but, it's time to change out the chef or get a restaurant consultant in and refresh the menu for it ever to be taken seriously for anything but drinks on the patio.   If you want good southwestern fusion fair in old town Scottsdale, try \"The Mission\" on the other side of Scottsdale road and just a couple blocks south or Barrio Cafe in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wow - such horribly disappointing Mexican food.  Outdoor ambiance is nice, but that is it.  The salsa was truly the worst I've every had.  Completely, utterly, bland and watery.  It was just yuck.  Plus you have to pay for chips and salsa.  What??  Margaritas were pretty good, but very little alcohol, especially for the price, and I'm not one to want a ton of alcohol in my drink.  We were seated indoors because there was a big party or something that reserved the patio.  Okay - that's fine, we didn't have a reservation anyway for a Tuesday night.  We were seated right by the walkway to the restroom and the air conditioner was blowing on one of my friends.  We asked to move to the table right next to us, but were curtly told \"no\".  Okay.....zero stars for attitude.  Next came that awful salsa, which was even more insulting because we had to pay for it.  Zero stars for that.  Main dish - the quesadilla, was okay - three stars.  Service was okay - 2-3 stars.  Nothing was outstanding, nothing was great, nothing was really good.  There are so many other choices in the Valley for great Mexican food - don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"I would say that \"meh\" accurately describes my experience here. Came here a few weeks ago for the first time and was seated with a large group on the patio. The patio is fantastic and their drinks (treasure margarita) hit the spot. We started with the chicken quesadillas which I think were overthought in execution and didn't enjoy too much. Munched on the chips and salsa for a bit. I decided on the margerita chicken which was not what anyone who ordered it expected. The \"stuffed chicken breast\" is actually 4-5 pieces of chicken that are stuffed/rolled. In any event, it wasn't AMAZING, and the people who got the pork and salmon off of the menu seemed much more pleased then the chicken diners. I'll definitely come back and give this place a second shot"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Fantastic service. Food ok. Had the green enchiladas and they needed some spice. Their salsa is ok. Guacamole is ok. If you like no spice then ok. Otherwise you need some hot sauce."}
{"text":"This has become a regular place we bring people to from out of town. The outside patio is beautiful! It has great ambience! The service is wonderful. They bring out fresh homemade tortillas, free of charge, with butter. I love their salsa. This place rocks. Just check it out. You got to trust me on this one. I've had the penne con pollo, green enchiladas, fish tacos, red enchiladas, meatloaf, and tortilla soup. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The homemade tortillas are my favorite part of the dining experience! The drinks are tasty and the servers are awesome! 

The outdoor patio is a fun place to be in the spring. This is the perfect spot for a night out with friends or if you're hosting guests from out of town. 

Located in old town Scottsdale it's a quick walk to shopping and The Valley Ho Hotel!"}
{"text":"We were here while on holiday and the recommendations on Yelp. the atmosphere was a lot of fun. We enjoyed our drinks, but when it came to our food we were all a little bit disappointed. The common complaint was that the food was bland for our expectations. We were all requesting chilis just to add a little heat to our dishes.

This seems to be a be a very popular spot, as we were seated next to another group of people that were meeting up from out of town, also. 

Maybe it was an off night for the kitchen? Based on the atmosphere alone, it is a place that we would go back to."}
{"text":"Old Tortilla Factory is a great place for large parties; We were next to no less than four other parties greater than 8 people. 

The location and indoor/outdoor seating arrangement was nice. I suggest you eat outside on the patio, if you can. 

The food was good but came in generous portions. They have a kids menu and options, but it seems an afterthought compared to the adult menu. It would be great if they added a basic bean and rice burrito for the ninos. 

The margarita selection looked impressive."}
{"text":"Excited to eat here for the first time. Service and atmosphere were great the food just so so. We ordered the green chili enchiladas which were good, Mai Mai tacos which were over cooked and the meatloaf that was missing the meat!!"}
{"text":"My best friend was visiting from back East and she wanted some good Mexican food while she was here. She had never been to Arizona before and we had spent the day walking around Tempe and Scottsdale. 
We just ordered drinks and appetizers because it was 104 that day, and she didn't want to eat anything heavy. We had their chorizo nachos which was delicious with fresh jalapenos, cotija cheese sprinkled on top and crema, instead of sour cream. We loved it along with the guacamole dip.
My only complaint was that there was inside seating available along with the patio where we were seated. We should have been offered a choice, but we weren't. It wasn't the server's fault. The blame lies squarely with hostess."}
{"text":"I came here on a business trip and a friend told me about this restaurant and it was delicious. The shrimp Diablo was incredible also they serve homemade tortillas with cheese butter and I could've just filled up on that alone. The ambience was amazing and romantic and will definitely be taking my girlfriend back for our anniversary. It was super crowded but they still managed to get me a great table. Service was good I'll be back."}
{"text":"It was ok.   I had the pork verde, I thought it was a little bland, but ok.  Nice outdoor dining, service was ok, gave us our check without asking if we wanted dessert, so I guess Elijah saved us some money.    I would not say it was great, but it definitely wasn't bad.   I wouldn't make it my first stop when I'm back in town, but I wouldn't refuse it if someone wanted go there."}
{"text":"I had a decent experience here.  We had dinner with a large group of people (about 20) and they accomodated us nicely outside.  The nachos were very good (I hardly think heart healthy!), as well as their house \"treasure\" margarita (though on the pricey side--but work was paying, so I didn't really feel the $12 hit!).  I ordered the tacos and was somewhat disappointed when they came out fajita style--I wasn't interested in really \"working\" for my meal since I was with a large group of volunteers from work and was more focused on visiting.  But beyond that, they weren't half bad.  Much better than any Mexican food you can get in Ann Arbor, so I was happy."}
{"text":"Probably the worst food for the money that I've ever had. Pure tourist trap is the best I can figure. There is no other sane reason this place could remain open. The only saving grace was a pretty patio area. Regardless, avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"I had the Penne con Pollo - DELICIOUS - and it was a large portion.   My husband had the Carne de Fuego and he loved it.  The atmosphere was fabulous and the staff was great.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Not very many vegetarian options.  The home made tortillas were good, but they are cooked in lard.  

Nice atmosphere outside though.  Would be great for a wedding rehearsal dinner since it's outside and Mexican food, perfect for out of towners experiencing Arizona."}
{"text":"It was okay.  The staff seems a little all over the place.  The wait was 30 minutes so the hostess sent us over to the bar. No one took our order so I walked over to the bar and asked if someone could help us.   The waiter seemed suprised that we had been sitting in the bar. The bar is not that big but obviously the staff is trying to provide drinks for the restaurant as well as the bar.  We eventually got served and then they called us to our table - but wait.  The table was not ready so the hostess asked us to wait again.  She virtually ran back and forth a few times and finally managed to seat us.  Why they called us and left us standing with our drinks and appetizer in hand is beyond me. Most restaurants would have transferred drinks and appetizers for us.   Then we find out the bar and the restaurant have two separate billing systems and we should have settled the bar bill in the bar - how were we to know that?  The food was okay but really nothing special.  Chips and salsa is $6.00 - lots of tortillas with the meal. 
The kids got pasta but it was way too rich and they both didn't eat it much.  The heaters were on outside but it was still freezing.  The food and atmosphere were fine but more hype than substance."}
{"text":"This was the worst Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. We had to buy our chips and salsa ($4.99) and the chips were cold and stale. I ordered the fish tacos and asked for flour tortillas, our waitress explained the only flour tortillas they have are the larger ones and warned me that the fish will look small on it. Really? A tortilla factory and you only make flour tortillas in one size?! She was right the fish was small, each of the three tacos came with a small strip of fish...worst fish tacos I've ever had. My daughter had the mixed tacos that came with steak, shrimp and chicken and she enjoyed them...which is my only reason that I didn't rate this place just one star. Not only was the food a disappointment but the place was a dump. Skip this place and Old Town all together."}
{"text":"Yuck.   Great tequilas, food is not worth writing home about.  If you are into sundried tomato butter and flour tortillas, then enjoy.  The food was mediocre at best, not worth the time it took to get there.  Tex Mex, and their specialty are their signature potato flour tortillas.  They claim best in show (Food Network) and if that's the case, then I'd stop watching FN... not even worth appetizers.  HOWEVER, head over to the bar and talk tequila!  They are proud of their selection, and on a quiet nite out, even the most experienced tequila lovers will learn a thing or two.  As for the food, touristy and blech .  Im not a fan of tex mex... better luck next time.  El gusto del buen provecho, definitivamente no fue nuestro!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place, the dishes are different than most Mexican places. They have tacos and enchiladas. But, they also have meat loaf and pork with Mexican fusion.  Their margaritas are pretty good. I must say I've tried at of them and they make flavored tortillas in house, and the flavor varies from day to day. I must say I've had them all. The old town tacos are fair enough for the beginner; including shrimp, beef, and chicken fajita. I like the Spanish rice here. But mostly I love their tortillas. It's a fun place to come and sit, nice patio and night when you're not dying from the heat. Good for a date night or after work drinks. Come check it out!!"}
{"text":"Solid food, get the pork chop and the Shrimp Diablo. Dlish!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. Service was good. The food left much to be desired. The margarita chicken was dry and had little flavor. The ribs were worse. The texture was strange and they were tasteless. I was really disappointed since the atmosphere is so neat."}
{"text":"A beautiful little oasis spot in a gorgeous location, this restaurant has survived off word of mouth for ages. My sister nominated this place to me as having the best Margaritas back before I was old enough to drink. Sadly, today this place is a mere shadow of its former self (if a place can have a 'self'). 

Today, the Margaritas taste like they came from a mix you could by at the grocery store. Much of the food is sub-par and tastes pretty bland... there is talent behind the scenes though. Management just chooses to cut corners to save money. Honestly, this place could really be magic. It's a good candidate for Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares. Especially considering that word of mouth is dwindling on this joint. It barely gets by on walk-in business from out-of-towners staying across the street at the Valley Ho, but even this won't last. 

A friend of mine works here (as does or did the short and slightly douchey Mike from the Paradise Hotel 2 reality show) and even admits that the place isn't doing well. It's really a shame because like I said, this was once a place that earned its word of mouth praise which was literally heaped on at one time.

As it is, this place is merely okay... the ambiance is better than the food, but it's not horrible. The only reason I suggest staying away is because I hope someday they turn it around and make it worth going again so that I can truly recommend it. If you do go, please tip generously. ;) Best times to go are early evenings in the spring or fall or on only the coolest of Arizona summer days."}
{"text":"Nice little place for outdoor patio dining, and the Staff is very friendly. I had the nachos, I really didn't care for it. It had some spicy sauce on it instead of cheese. My wife had the Flautas w/ mole sauce. She didn't like the mole sauce but after scraping it off, she liked the flauta w/ beef. We will be back to try some other dishes, but until then....3 stars"}
{"text":"Best House Margarita in town, hands down. Honestly, I've tried to duplicate their tangy concoction a few times--the waitstaff says it's the standard stuff--I'm convinced they let the lime juice go a little bad to make it tangy. Call me crazy. Doesn't matter how they make it though, cause that shit's fantastic and it keeps me coming back. 

Can't remember their food too much. I mostly just remember that their vegetarian options are sparse or less-than-exciting.

If you've not been to OTTF, make sure to sit outside; you're wasting your time if you end up inside.

BTW, I've only dumped ice from the margarita tumbler all over the table once. Woohoo!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by a work colleague. We were in the area for a company meeting. We had a party of 14  and the restaurant was very accommodating. The atmosphere was very bland. We had an array of apps that ranged from guacamole, cheese dip, and nachos. The nachos were very cheesy to the point the nachos were soggy. We had a one person ordered a quesadilla that was churchy and buttery. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos. The chef could have cooked it less and could have added additional seasoning. The rice was very tasteful, along with the veggies. Margaritas were refreshing. I would recommend the platinum margarita."}
{"text":"Well, where to begin.... the server was awesome, the food however was not. Green over red sauce all day, the best item on the menu is the flavorful steak tacos, do not get the steak medallions fuego... the tenderness of the steak was great just had no flavor... I'd like to think they thought they were dumping seasoning on it but the top was still one he container... margaritas were awesome... however the cost for this place is not worth the one out of five patrons being happy with their food. Salsa, guac, and fundido is the way to go... don't forget to ask for the hotter hot sauce as well. I would only go back if someone was having a birthday there. One last note their house tortilla and garlic butter was amazeballs."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was extremely lacking.  Enchiladas were bland and undersauced.  Flautas were basically chimichangas.  Basically over Americanized food that is way over priced."}
{"text":"Mexican restaurant review numero dos...The Tortilla Factory.

How are the ratings on this little gem so low? I loved it. I visited the Tortilla Factory and sat outside on their lovely little romantical patio. The garden-ish area was lit by pretty white lights and the service was perfect. 

I ordered fish tacos and they were incredible. My +1 ordered the salmon and it was super good as well. 

Hit this place up, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Outstanding atmosphere, service and most importantly their food. 
Good for gathering and having great time."}
{"text":"Visited here for the first time while my mom and sister were visiting from Ohio after having 3 recommendations to try it out! 
Food was delicious and portion sizes were great! Everything was great, and the server even offered to take several photos for us to showcase our experience via Facebook for Ohio friends and family! (Haha) overall great positive vibe with great good and great service!
oh, and OMG!!  the chocolate cake for dessert was impressive!! all 4 of us shared, and we still took some home! 
margaritas were good, as well as all of our other food!!"}
{"text":"Nothing ticks me off more than having to spend a lot of money on food that doesn't taste good. The patio atmosphere was nice, and our waitress was attentive, but the prices were very high and the food was bland at best. Even the salsa was lacking. If you are looking for good Mexican food, don't look here."}
{"text":"It's in a pretty good location in DT Scottsdale, just slightly off the beaten path.  There's a large area outdoors for those nice fall/winter nights.  

The pros:  the bread (in this case tortilla) is really good.  It's served with a special tasty spread.

The cons: the rest of the food is pretty mediocre.  

Service was not so good for a slow night.  Waiter only came by about twice."}
{"text":"Old Town Tortilla Factory 

We really had no intentions of eating at the Tortilla Factory on our recent trip to Scottsdale even when it came highly recommended by more than one person. However one evening as we were driving through the Old Town area we saw the place and said there is the Old Town Tortilla Factory that we've heard about and the setting drew us in. If nothing else the outdoor seating area is worth the trip. Along with the usual chips and salsa they serve complimentary fresh made tortillas with butter. You know they are fresh as you can stand there and watch them made right before your eyes. My first thought was okay a tortilla how good could that be. I decided it could be that good, that night they were serving a black bean tortilla with a cheddar butter and it was delicious.  I went pretty basic that night and ordered the Old Town Tacos and was blown away by the size of the serving it was a build your own taco plate that came with steak, chicken and shrimp along with some black beans, rice a pico and some lettuce. The steak and chicken were outstanding. Surprisingly enough perhaps the highlight of the evening was off of the children's menu. The cheese crisp was amazing some melted cheese on a crisp tortilla, I so glad our granddaughter was with us otherwise we may have missed out.  If i'm in the area again I will definitely order from the childrens menu."}
{"text":"+1 star for cool, outdoor patio atmosphere and that I had a table along the fire-pit fountain. +1 star for a nice server and overall fast & attentive service. Other than that, food here is pretty gross. Very limited menu (with nothing you want, except maybe guac, 'cause the chips weren't even good) and pretty pricey for the dog food (\"beef\") you get. We had nachos as an app, and then actually chose to leave after that w/o doing entrees. Enough said. They did bring some jalapeno (?) flour tortillas and red pepper (?) compound butter as their version of a bread basket, but even this tasted somewhat off. Not bad, but for sure not worth the carbs. There are many great Mexican places in Scottsdale, so skip this one."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave the Tortilla Factory four stars is because it's not open for lunch.  What's up with that?

I think the food is good, personally.  My favorite dish is the Poblano de Mariscos.  I love seafood so this is the best.

Too start with, the margaritas are awesome.  My favorite is the raspberry...so yummy!  They have other fresh fruit flavors as well.

You can dine on the patio or inside...I prefer the patio at night.  It's all lit up and when it's cool outside it's just perfect."}
{"text":"A friend that has dined at OTTF several times recommended it for dinner while we were here on business. I was not disappointed! The margaritas are delicious - no sickly sweet mixer here! An enormous bowl of chips and fresh hand made flour tortillas with flavored butter are the perfect starter for your meal.

We both ordered the Old Town Tacos - build your own tacos featuring grilled steak, chicken and shrimp with black beans, rice & fresh salsa. They were delicious. The meat was tender, the beans perfectly seasoned.

My only complaint was that the misters could have been turned on sooner as it was 100 degrees, but we were sitting in the shade and weren't over heated.

A very pleasant experience with attentive service, perfect margaritas & delicious food."}
{"text":"Definitely not authentic Mexican food. The name draws you in, but I should have taken the other reviews more seriously.

The $13 margarita was watered down and the Chorizo Queso was warm (not hot as it should be served). The chips seemed like they were from a bag - Tostitos anyone? What's more there was literally one tablespoon of chorizo in the entire \"dip\", really!? After spending $50 here on 3 drinks and one appetizer we decided to go elsewhere for dinner since we were unimpressed from the get-go. 

Even the \"house-made\" tortillas lacked flavor. The only draw is the ambiance of the patio. Move on."}
{"text":"I first went to Tortilla Factory for my Senior High School Prom (2002) and have continuously gone back often. I can't rave enough about the patio, service and amazing food. This is one of our favorite spots in AZ and tell all our friends and out of town guests about it!"}
{"text":"Tortilla Factory is one of our favs in Scottsdale. The food is great and they have amazing margaritas.  Most of the seating is out on the patio. They have tons of patio heaters, so you are dining comfortably outside even in January.  The staff is always super friendly. Everyone that works there seems to be really happy.  We took our toddler there on our last visit for an early dinner. She loved all of the action. Check it out if you are looking for tasty Mexican food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Great patio at night during the cooler months.

 We recently enjoyed the nice weather with a southwestern feast here. The menu was definitely Mexican, but a little off-beat too. This is a great place to go with a group of friends to get the \"old town\" party started.

Overall good food, nice atmosphere, fair prices, and an amazing location."}
{"text":"Good place overall! The atmosphere is amazing and the outdoor patio has a great ambiance. As for the food, it is pretty good but very different from your traditional Mexican dishes. However, still very good! I would for sure come back again. Only con was that service could be better, but overall great!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst restaurants I have ever eaten at....

The service was left wanting to say the least, the staff were rude, inattentive, and seemed far more interested in talking to each other, texting on their phones or just doing their best to avoid customers... their were slow to take our drinks order, I looked at the time it took about 15 minutes... our food order took far longer.... then when our food come out it came out in four trips.... (there were four of us at the table, I am glad not more I would hate to think how long that would have taken)

The food.... while the menu looked good and the food sound appealing , although a little on the pricey side for what it was... when it came out I don't think it could have got much worse...  I order a chicken dish that was poached... I think that my napkin would have had more flavor in it... I am certain that it was just cooked in plain water and all of the flavor that might have existed in the chicken was left in the poaching water, I know that it wasn't in the chicken that I was severed... my wife ordered a dish she ask is this spicy? she was told not at all.... I would have liked to ask the server what their meaning of not at all is, if only I could have found him and kept him at the table away from his phone long enough to ask... I like spicy food as does my wife, but we could not eat it.... a-la Guy Fieri, Triple D, atomic chicken wings... I think that they put quite an amount of habanero if not bhut jolokia in it... fun thing was though they forgot the salt or anything else that might have resembled flavor.... my sons ordered fried chicken strips.... I think that they were left in the frier just short of becoming shoe leather... if they were trying to bring visions of the Sonoran Desert they did with the chicken strips!

From reading Yelp these guy are just all over the place... sometimes good... sometimes you get them like us.... I would like to hope that it was nothing we did to upset them.... if it was us I am sorry that we upset you that much!

The only good thing was they were able to serve the beer cold... it was the only the got right all night...

Oh when we went to complain... well good luck finding a server... paid... left... disappointed"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant for many reasons... 

Great service, great atmosphere, and great food! 

I recommend the Pork Chops, Seabass, or the Meatloaf. All the Margaritas are awesome. 

Located in Old Town Scottsdale this is a great place to start your night then head out the the bars after a great meal and a few drinks."}
{"text":"Came here expectations of a nice meal.  Started with the tortilla of the day, tonight if memory serves me, it was potatoe.  It was good.  Then ordered chips and salsa; we've had better.  For the main meal my husband had the pork chop, I ordered the Chicken Margharita...what a mistake I made!  It tasted like what you would think was boiled rubber!  No flavor, tough as shoe leather I couldn't eat it.  I gave some to my husband and he promptly cut his pork chop and gave me that to eat.  What bothered me the most is the waitress saw I didn't eat the chicken with exception of a bite or two and didn't bother to ask me about it to learn what my view was on that dish.  I would have politely told her that dish should be taken off the menu!  The pork chop was good, but not great.  Overall...it was a lousy dining experience and we won't bother to come back and will tell our friends of our negative experience.  The positive thing....the outdoor setting is lovely..now if they could just fix the menu."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed.......  It was a large group which I know presents some problems, but the server was not attentive (maybe because he know there would be a Forced 18% tip??). The food was OK, the drinks were OK, although a little on the expensive side. You have to BUY Chips, but thier so-so tortilla's are free.....  Checks showed up severl in a folio, but nothing was said, leading to some confusion. Then the server was indignat about it.  Not sure I would go back, which is a shame as the atmosphere was good.........."}
{"text":"The courtyard patio is nice... They should stick with that and change everything else. 
I called to make a reservation that day for two and was told they weren't taking reservations because rain was in the forecast for that night. We arrived after about 5 minutes of rain to find that they had a party of 90 that was outside that they were trying to accommodate inside. The hostess was rude and said they were trying to figure out what to do with all the people outside that had to be brought inside due to the rain and it could be up to 2 hours until we're sat. Ok. A party of 90 would have been booked well in advance. They knew there was a chance of rain and may need to accommodate them inside prior to the rain falling, that's why they weren't taking reservations, right? We asked if we could eat at the bar and were told yes, only to go to the bar and be told \"no because it suddenly got slammed in the bar.\" So we went back and put our name in because we saw plenty of dry tables throughout the dining areas and sat at the bar and had drinks. 
The bartender was friendly but we heard all the servers complaining and it was just a bad vibe all around. Thank god I was with good company here. I bought a 3 course meal for 2 on DealChicken that was going to expire and me lose my money or else we would have gone any place else. The margaritas were good. The appetizer, chorizo fundido, was good. We were done with those when it slowed down enough that the bartender said we could stay there and eat and our table was ready. We sat down at our table for a couple minutes without seeing a server and decided to go back to the bar to finish our food. The servers were confused about who was going to get our table, so it would have been a long time before we could have ordered our entrees if we didn't go back to the bar. My friend ordered tacos, which she had one and took the rest home since she was full on the appetizer and so much time passed between courses. I ordered the pollo margarita which was a little dry, but good. The potato thing was nasty. The chocolate cake we took to go and ate the next day was good. 
There's hundreds of restaurants in Old Town and this does not compete against any of them. If you want terrible food and service and a great patio, this is the place. If you go just a couple blocks northeast, you'll find great Mexican food, good service, and a great patio at a different restaurant. There's plenty of competition and this place must get by on a reputation from years ago, because it sucks now."}
{"text":"We live in Litchfield Park, but took the trip to Scottsdale based on this place's reputation. The building and decor are super nice in a throwback Spanish mission sort of way. The separate \"tequilleria\" and patio are attention getting. since it was 119 degrees, we sat inside. 

That is where the fun ended. 

We ordered chips and salsa for $5. No big deal, but where else do you pay for that in any sit down joints anymore? They do bring out fresh tortillas, gratis, but we didn't know that and it's not mentioned on the menu.

The menu is pretty limited and oh so pricey. $15.00 for two a la cart tacos. Holey Moley, they better be stuffed with caviar. There is no taco on the planet worth $7.50 (maybe worth $7 :-)) and I have had some great tacos. These are not those tacos.

The fish tacos were under seasoned portions of Mahi Mahi. The fish itself was not seasoned at all and actually had a fishy taste. Not pleasant. It was served with radishes rather than coleslaw which was interesting and the crema which was tasty. But as a whole, it was bland and underwhelming even after adding the accompanying sauce.

We also had the bacon wrapped spicy meatloaf on garlic mashed potatoes. Served with a zippy red pepper sauce and tree trunk sized asparagus. The sauce was very tasty, the meatloaf was tender and not  dry. There was something so rich in the meatloaf itself, that after 3/4 of one slice, I couldn't eat anymore of it. It just began to turn my stomach. The potatoes were cooked really well and had some nice flavor, but needed salt. That was funny, because there was no salt on the table. The asparagus was well cooked and still had some snap, but like the potatoes, it was under seasoned.

We ordered the banana stuffed fried tortilla in blackberry reduction and were disappointed there too. The tortillas were overstuffed with banana, so that you couldn't enjoy the crunchy texture of the cinnamon crusted tortilla. It just became mush. The reduction was not \"reduced\" and was runny, but tasty. 

For three of us, the tab totaled over $85 before tip. That included 2 bud lights, which WERE cold and refreshing. 

All said, the environment is far more interesting than the food. The place's reputation is undeserved at half the price!"}
{"text":"I had no idea one could find Mexican food THIS disappointing in Arizona.  This place wasn't just bad Mexican for Arizona, this would even be considered bad Mexican by Pittsburgh, or maybe even China standards.

Had the meatloaf (which we expected some kind of Mexican twist...) it sounded amazing.  AND the waitress recommended it!  So three people in our party of ten were stuck eating what tasted like meat flavored foam.  My step father ate all of his green enchiladas, but that means little -- he would eat anything someone put in front of him.  When I asked if it was good, he nodded with a \"meh\" expression on his face. 

The drinks were ok.   The tortilla bread service with butter was the highlight.  

Not inexpensive but not outrageous.   But if you're in Arizona, WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU SETTLE FOR SUBSTANDARD MEXICAN FOOD?   Just don't."}
{"text":"I loved my experience here on Saturday night. Our party of 20 was huge and our waitress was spot on the entire time. She made excellent food and drink recommendations and every single one of us left full and happy! The warm tortillas they send out with butter are ahhhmazimg (they rotate flavors of tortilla and butter I believe). 

The tacos were flavorful and you definitely get a good amount of food for the price. The platinum margarita is a MUST.

This place really wins me over with the outdoor patio. Beautifully decorated with lights and a romantic/fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Ever see the 2 girls, 1 cup video? I think I'd rather try that than ever eat at Tortilla Factory again.

It's that bad. Really. The worst (in every way) restaurant I have ever been to. In my entire life. 

Caveat emptor. 

For those who would like more details-- The food is literally the driest, most bland, worst in Scottsdale. The service is also the worst in Scottsdale. And there's a dude with a shaved head who appears to possibly/likely be coked and/or roided out who lurked angrily around the tables and flew into a psychotic rage when he asked us what we thought of the food and we gave him a tactful and polite, but honest answer. I'm pretty sure he's the owner and started the restaurant with money form his daddy who founded the Cold Stone chain."}
{"text":"Good place, great patio dinning experience. Food was really good, fresh ingredients and very well displayed. Would visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Came here for a work event with a bunch of co- workers. They gave us a prix fixe menu to pick food from. 

Everyone got the house salad, it was pretty average. They had chips and salsa on the table when we got there- decent. 

We got to pick between chicken, filet, and ribs. I picked the filet- it was juicy but still kind of tough to chew. My co- worker got the ribs and they were huge- huge stack. The food was average overall but they gave a huge quantity of it.

They also brought out their house made tortilla with butter. 

Service was really good but food was just average.  I wasn't super impressed by any of the items I consumed. Margaritas were pretty sugary."}
{"text":"Date night out on a cool evening so we  chose one of our prior, outdoor seating favorites.  They booked a large party complete with slide show that made it seem  like you were at a convention banquet, not what you want on date night. Seated at a dirty, small bar table. Cut night short soup/appetizer/dessert.  Tortilla soup was cold, the Chicken Flautas were good once you scraped the excessively hot, not mild as described, Mole sauce off of them, the chocolate cake was huge and delicious as described. They compt'd the cake for us due to the circumstances. In all fairness mediocre food, convention like atmosphere, friendly staff. We had fun anyway in this goofy atmosphere because it was date night out. I'll find out what parties are booked before going again in the future."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The patio is a definite need with this cooler weather. Inside is nothing specially. Certainly recommend sitting outside. The food was good. Tortillas were great. The main courses were good, but nothing that will blow your socks off. The service was rather slow. Waited a long time between appetizer and our meals. Then had to wait a good fifteen minutes before we got our check. I'd would recommend checking out once for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant exceeded my expectations. I'm visiting friends in Arizona and we decided to go here because of how cute the outdoor area is. It is beautiful and the food was delicious and the drinks were as well. All of us loved our food. We got the red enchiladas, tacos and chips and salsa. The plates of good were so big and the service was great as well. Our waitress was so friendly and helpful about everything since it was our first time there. Next time I am in town I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in forever. Recently came for my friend birthday dinner. We sat on the patio, it was so nice out. Love the Christmas lighting and it also had a water fountain, super cuteee. Love the ambiance.

The waiter was very patient when it came to me, I'm a vegetarian so I had ask 100 questions. Haha i end up making my own nachos. Fresh chips, black beans, pico de gallo, lettuce, jalapeños and vegetables, and Salsa on the side. It was phenomenal. It was such a big portion.  Glad I shared my entrée with a friend."}
{"text":"The margaritas were decent, but you need to drink a couple of them in order to not notice how dry the food is. The chips and salsa are great. The tortilla soup needed a bit more spice."}
{"text":"Some of the best Southwest Tex-Mex that I have ever consumed. A few coworkers and I tried this restaurant on a whim. The ambience is cozy and the service is friendly. More than that, the food is fantastic.

We started with the flautas appetizer with mole. Some of the best mole ever. I ordered the tortilla soup and mahi mahi tacos for dinner. The tortilla soup was perfectly seasoned and had great layers of flavor. My coworkers loved their dishes too.

The complimentary bread was jalepeno flavored tortillas which are definitely their claim to fame. Fresh from the oven and yummy with butter. We also shared the flan dessert. It had great flavor and texture, plus it was surrounded by strawberries and almonds.

I can't wait to come back when I am town!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin!!! My team and I were visiting from Atlanta, Ga and this restaurant was preselected by the team in Arizona. When I heard we were going to a Mexican restaurant, I wasn't too thrilled. I swear we eat Mexican multiple times a week. However, when we arrived the ambiance was beautiful, the weather was perfect and the wait time was null! Our wait staff was amazing. He was funny, helpful and very knowledgeable. Our appetizers were loaded nachos, which were AMAZING. We had a preset menu, which was awesome because I'm so indecisive lol. I ordered the old town tacos. It was shrimp, steak and chicken on tortilla shells. HEAVEN in my mouth. This was everything. Shout out to our waiter who continued to fill my water because I was not prepared for the dryness. Overall great experience and great food. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Lovely patio and they did a great job keeping up with our large group for lunch recently.  I got green enchiladas which were decent and my son loved his taquitos (which actually seemed to be made there and not frozen from Costco).  

But the salsa was *super* bland with no kick at all, and (whether reasonable or not) I tend to be annoyed when Mexican restaurants charge for chips/salsa service.  I did love their warm little tortillas/sour cream chive butter, but even that was weird, it seems to be their version of chips/salsa..... but only came out after we'd ordered several apps and with no warning - seems to me that a simple \"Hi, welcome!  We don't do free chips and salsa here but we have something even better coming your way!\" when seated would probably negate some of the whiny \"no free chips???\" reviews!"}
{"text":"So we came here for a company meeting I got to tell you at first I was kind of disappointed not because of the food or the place. but usually we go to go cart racing bowling stuff like that but let me tell you this place was amazing the service was top-notch the food was great some of the best steak and chicken I've ever had, with the great service and the great food I didn't miss the other stuff we use to do this place was the best and I wanted to say thank you to Suzannah Modzelewski for taking care of the BW group."}
{"text":"We were disappointed with our overall experience.  When we arrived we were told it was an hour wait for dinner.  Place looked great so we decided to wait.  Bar service was great, we sat at the bar and the the bartenders were quick, friendly and efficient.  We had chips, salsa and guacamole with our cocktails.  We were called to a table after about 15 minutes and were very surprised.  The table was a tall cocktail table in the breezeway with tall bar stools to sit on.  However the table was barely large enough to hold our chips, salsa and drinks we brought from the bar.  The whole experience was very un comfortable.   We had both the red and green enchiladas and the taco platter.  The green enchiladas were ok but not great.  The red enchiladas lacked flavor and we could not finish it.  Taco platter was probably the best.  Lots of things to add, shrimp, chicken and steak. The biggest problem was putting three people on a dinky cocktail table.  For the price the food was less than we anticipated."}
{"text":"Went there using a Groupon. Drinks were like water.  Food was all carbs and not very good. Value was supposed to be $112 for 2 people but cost us $55 for Groupon.  Not worth half that for a poor meal.  Don't waste your money on this place.  Have to say service was excellent but that does not make up for an awful meal. So if Groupons are supposed to introduce us to the great food and drink  we might enjoy next time, I am introduced to a place I will never go again!!"}
{"text":"Definitely try out their seabass, it's crispy on the outside, very fresh and was cooked to perfection.  
The rest of the dishes were all pretty average. Our waitress also recommended the salmon but we didn't get to try that.  
As for dessert, we tried the banana crisp, not too bad."}
{"text":"I loved living in Scottsale because of the warm weather and sitting outside! Tortilla Factory has a HUGE patio

I don't really understand all the bad reviews aside from the service being really slow. Slow service and bad service are not the same. We had to send our queso back because it tasted really watery and the server didn't give us dirty looks about it or anything. The margaritas are delicious (could probably use a little more tequilla..but i like to taste the alcohol), and the tortilla's they give you are really good too. The chicken entree I ordered was also very tasty.

Would probably come more for the ambiance than the food but it def does NOT deserve 2 stars."}
{"text":"Recently made my second visit to this restaurant with a friend.  Beautiful, large patio, excellent service, and great food.  Certainly not your typical Mexican restaurant - I would review the menu online before deciding on eating here.  Our meals have always been very good.  It is a nice place to go for an evening of visiting with friends without feeling rushed by a staff looking to turn the table.  It is also one of the better options for a larger party in terms of seating."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place!! So I'm a bit surprised to see the lower rating reviews. 

I came here for dinner with the lover. We sat outside on the patio which is absolutely adorable. They have a waterfall to set the mood. Lol. I started with the blue agave margarita. This was delicious! It also comes with a shaker!! My entree I ordered the carne de fuego. The steak at their restaurant is just extremely tasteful. It was perfect. Our waitress also informed us that they have custom tortillas that change on a daily basis. The evening we came we tried a red pepper tortilla that also came with a jalepeno butter. Oh my gosh!!! 

I thought that everything was just absolutely delicious and perfect. From the drinks, to the food, to the excellent customer service, to the cute outdoor patio. The only negative for me was I wish they had a bigger menu.  I'll definitely be back for more!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the Old Town Tortilla Factory. Great variety of food to choose from. We started with the Nachos and had enchiladas and quesadilla. Everyone was very pleased with their choices.    I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - 4
service - 4
Food - 1
Value - 0

Very disappointed!!! Service was great and Matt was a great server. All the people at my table (8) agreed with my star value.

The potato tortilla was really good, but that's it... Just order a beer and tortillas.

We ordered the chicken Monterey, Build your tacos, along with green enchiladas.

Chicken Monterey was dry and lacked a lot of flavor. When I added the table salsa, it made it worse. The salsa was not pleasant and it tasted like it was made from a can stuff... I say stuff, because I want to keep it clean.

Build your tacos w/shrimp was really bad. The shrimp had no flavor along with the chicken and meat. The tortillas it came with, was a lower end tortilla (ghetto) and wasn't homemade. They have corn, flour, and potato tortillas..  Stick with the potato, but sure you ask for them in advance, because the cook can stop making them anytime. 

The green enchiladas were ok.... They tasted a lot better than everything else... We all took a few bites and left our food... I told Matt I didn't want my food boxed, I just wanted a few more potato tortillas; however the cook stopped... I think the cooked stopped years ago. I wouldn't call him a cook... I would call him &$@&)...

Think twice before you go here... The whole table agreed, we all wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Awful. We had a large party of 18 and when we got there promptly for our reservation out table was not ready.  We were led to our table and only a portion of us could sit down.  The rest of the group stood in the middle of the restaurant while we waited for a smaller table to clear and pay their tab.  The salsa was tasteless, the salmon was gross and the ribs were worse.  Not a fan!!!"}
{"text":"There are lots of places to eat in Scottsdale. This is not one I would recommend. The food isn't that good and the margaritas are watered down. The atmosphere can be nice, as they have a large outdoor patio, but for the price and quality there are tons of better places around. Oh, and you have to pay for chips and salsa if that tells you anything."}
{"text":"Horrible food , horrible service . Food takes forever to arrive at your table and it does not taste good at all ! Being at the heart of old town Scottsdale , it was a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Seniors and senioritàs listen very carefully.... DO come to this place if your looking to spend a pretty peso on delicious food! If you want some awesome food with a Tex-mex flair then come here and you will be MUY BUEN!!!! Beautiful atmosphere, gorgeous twinkle lights, and cool outdoor patio seating...Now DONT come here if your looking for your traditional Mexican fiesta with the perfect enchilada, chips and salsa or taco....  chips and salsa was bleh (and also cost $6), my grandma was not satisfied with her enchilada and instead of chips and salsa you can expect a plate of freshly made tortillas with butter (again, delicious- but not what I expect when I think a traditional Mexican meal) if you want some true blue Mexican food go somewhere else--- if you want a fun night with a Tex mex twist and a fun atmosphere in awesome old town Scottsdale come here!"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!!! The food, ambience and  service from our waiteress Mary was AWESOME. We had a shrimp appetizer to start out with that was out of the world to start with along with their KILLER chips and salsa. 

We choose this place based on the Yelp reviews, and feel they were unfair or incorrect on their evaluations. We will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"So-So food. You eat outside, they have lots of heated lamps outside. The neighborhood isnt all that nice to have an expensive restaurant in.  From my experience the atmosphere is very strange"}
{"text":"Great place for a group party. We had a work retirement party at the Old Town Tortilla Factory and were placed in a room with a bar all to our self. The servers had kept the drink tub stocked and were very informative when it came to letting the group know that the dinner buffet was ready and when dessert was going to be put out. I didn't see anyone outside of our group in the room while we were using it. Food was average but that could be because it was a buffet. I would park in the arts district and walk the block to the restaurant so you can get a feel of the neighborhood, see the art walk and avoid tipping for valet parking."}
{"text":"Great old-school Tex-Mex restaurant that has been around for a very long time. I have not been in over 10 years but had a very good meal excellent service Andy Cool vibe from the patrons. Definitely worth checking out not the best place for Mexican food but definitely an interesting old school spot in Old Town Scottsdale. Ryan the bartender is the bomb he will definitely take care of you and make you feel welcome especially with his drinks and pours. Great guy."}
{"text":"This place is basically one or two notches up from your local El Torito. I liked how they had a variety of seating areas inside and outdoors and from where me and my family were sitting it felt very private which was nice. 

I got the Old Town Tacos, which was satisfying in portion and flavor but for $17 I expected a little more. If I remember correctly we had to pay for tortilla chips and salsa which I'm generally not accustomed to. A little skeptical if the restaurant lives up to their name as a tortilla factory because the tortillas were mediocre in my opinion."}
{"text":"Wow, surprised reviews from others were on the so-so, not too happy side. We really enjoyed this place. The inside atmosphere had a \"quaint\" kind of feel. The carne asada steak tacos were delish, they have great homemade tortillas.  I recommend this fine Mexican establishment if you are in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've written a Yelp review, but my experience at this place was so bad it had to be done!! First of all we for at least 15 minutes before our waitress came over to take a drink order. Our drinks slowlly trickled to the table one at a time, and were a combination of wrong and bad. Dinner w.as amazingly uninteresting. I had a caesar salad with grilled chicken - I know, it's a Mexican restaurant and I should have ordered Mexican food - but still I expected a nice, freshly grilled chicken breast on a nice salad. Instead I got a salad with virtually no dressing, covered with cold, pastey chicken. I tasted a few of my friends' dishes and didn't think it was a whole lot better. At the end of the meal, the famous fresh tortillas, which were supposed to be an appetizer, arrived at the table.

If you want a nice dinner with good service, look somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This place was good. 
Their queso fundito was tasty and the homemade tortillas were great.
Good service and the setting is great. 
Can't wait to return when it's cooler so we can enjoy the cute patio seating. 
: )"}
{"text":"We went here with visitors from out of town. They picked it. The atmosphere is great sitting outside on the patio in the evening. The wait staff was excellent. She was very nice about my dietary needs. Our dinners were very good. The margaritas were good too. I had mahi mahi tacos $19 for 3 small mini tacos, others had the mixed tacos, and fundido dip. Two things bothered me. One is that the food is pretty pricy. I realize it's right in the middle of downtown Scottsdale and many tourists probably eat there. Maybe more locals would if the prices were about $5 less per entree. The other thing is \"no separate checks\". This is so inconvenient for a couple reasons. Our visitors were not paying for our meal so it would have been nice to have two separate checks. We ended up paying for dinner and them trying to pay us back. The other thing is, because no separate check, our visitors sat there trying to figure the bill out. It got embarrassing until we took the check and paid. Not a fun experience."}
{"text":"So I'm gunna piggyback off of what my girlfriend Lindsey E. wrote in her review of Old Town Tortilla Factory. First off this place was indeed ¡MUY DELICIOSO! We ended up trying what seems like everybody and their madres recommended here on yelp which was their dish called Carne De Feugo! It was super tasty and fulfilling and was one of the cheaper dishes on the menu at $16 but totally worth it to me and Lindsey. The only reason we're giving it a four star was because this place is not going to satisfy your craving of Mexican food or atmosphere, but don't get me wrong it's super delicious food and the outdoor patio with all the lights and the unique fire fountain gives you a lot to talk and gawk about during your stay at the Tortilla Factory! Our waiter was increíble and gave us stupendous service so it was an all around great experience here! 8.5/10"}
{"text":"This is my first ever review, the only reason I writing it is because it was so bad. I use yelp everyday and it works very well. This place was bad enough that I had to tell others.
I ordered the tacos and steak was burnt chicken was burnt and dry. I could've stayed at my house and made tacos way better than this. These were $17 also, rip off!!!"}
{"text":"Tried to call to make a reservation number on web site was wrong never could get there"}
{"text":"This place is crap..where do I start. 
-the absurd prices considering the quality.
-the margaritas that seemingly have no tequila
-having to pay or chips and salsa. 
-the chips being crap
-the menu being all over the place. 
-the food just being bad
-the food giving me terrible gas that will leave you on the toilet for 20-35 minutes. 
-everything is bland an lacks authenticity. 

I could keep going but i have to get back to the toilet. Go to a real Mexican restaurant.  This isn't one."}
{"text":"Tortilla Factory is the quintessential Mexican Restaurant to be well expected in Arizona . The food and customer service is over the top delicious .   I went in with a work friend for drinks and appetizers . The margaritas are off the hook and there is no skimping on any part of the love that was used to make these drinks . The food was hot , fresh and delicious ! I don't typically order quest because I think it's too heavy but I'm glad I took the suggestion and tried it . It was amazing and cheesy-lious ! Hope to be back with the family for dinner sometime ."}
{"text":"You would expect a place called Old Tortilla Factory to deliver the best tortilla...as yelp would say on a 2-star, \"Meh, I have experienced better.\"  The chips that we got made from the tortilla was cold to start off with.  They gave us a tortilla separately with a cheese butter.  That was pretty decent, but when it came to my red enchiladas, I was not very pleased.  The red sauce on the red enchilada sauce tasted like very bitter vinegar.  I have tried enchiladas from many establishments throughout my life, and this has to be THE WORST.  

What saves this from a 1-star performance was pretty decent margaritas.  I may have to come back here to try something else, but it may be a very long time."}
{"text":"thankfully it's warm enough in the desert to eat outside, with the aid of heating lamps. the house margarita is sublime, the horny isn't that bad looking either. i loved their mushrooms & tortillas. while there, the bartender convinced me to have some partida tequila. i sniffed, ogled &  proceeded to let the smoothness trickle down. great staff- they're really accommodating."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, the food is bland. Nay recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with a very cool ambiance.   Great bar area with a HUGE selection!  They have a very large patio seating area, but it was drizzling when I visited so wound up waiting a half hour to get seated. It's probably wise to make a reservation for this place.

The food was great.  We had stuffed quesadillas for appetizers that were absolutely delicious!  The complimentary cheese tortillas when we were seated were also quite the treat!  I had the Fish Tacos, which were also fantastic.  

It was a bit expensive, but it was worth it.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for classic Mexican, this isn't the place for you.  I went in hoping for a yummy enchilada and a few strong margaritas.  

I came out with a taste of delicious fresh tex-mex, well made drinks, and a GREAT dining experience.

Granted, I went to Tortilla factory early in the evening before they were busy.  The waiter spent ten minutes chatting with us, educating us on the menu, drinks, and cuisine.  His recommendations and interactions are what made the experience above and beyond.

My recommendation is to jump right into the traditional \"entree\" cuisine, even if you are in more of a greasy enchilada sort of mood.  Ask the waiter for his or her recommendations,  (I loved the pork), and even if it's hot, sit outside.  The ambience is well worth it."}
{"text":"In all honesty ... 1 star might be overrated.  I rarely write reviews, but this restaurant needs to step up their game!  I would not only return, but I would discourage others from going.

WAITED - over 30 minutes ... after a reservations was made.
Food was awful.  Drink were awful.
There was a cockroach at our table.

I could go on and on, but overall, the management was rude, the food was not edible, and it was very disappointing. We had a lovely waiter that was doing his best, but could not compensate for everything else."}
