{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. It's tucked away just of W. 25th, making it easy to get to, great for stopping somewhere else before or after, but away from some of the madness.

I think this is one of the best happy hour options around and enjoyed coming for a burger and beer at the bar. But, most of my visits have been for sit down dining. 

The place is smaller and feels comfortable while still being \"nice.\" The calamari is spot on, even though it doesn't seem adventurous. So are the bacon wrapped dates. Nothing here is pushing the barrier of culinary creativity, but it's cooked perfectly. Every. Time. That to me is even more important. 

The house made gnocchi is a favorite of whomever I dine with any time we go. I also can never resist the duck confit when it's available. The pork chop is always being served differently but never disappoints, and when they have a walleye available it's another favorite. Again, the execution is always perfect. 

The Market at the Fig which is attached/next door is also amazing. Great sandwiches or charcuterie for lunch."}
{"text":"Flying fig is generally my go-to spot for brunch and for dinner with visitors to Cleveland.  In the past, I've had only positive experiences and excellent food.  However, I recently stopped in for brunch with a few visiting friends and am now questioning if I will be returning which is a real shame.  I should start off by saying that my friends visiting from Philadelphia and DC were surprised by how high the prices were.  The food was, as always, well-executed, but the service was so unpleasant and condescending that it was hard to enjoy the experience.  One of us is vegetarian and we asked if it would be possible to get the meat on the side for two of the dishes.  This seemingly innocuous request was met with a snide quip that \"the chef doesn't believe in customizing his menu for the customer.\"  Fair enough, but I should mention that the vegetarian version of the dish is the same price and that we were directed to the sides menu if we wanted to pay for a similar protein to that left off of our order for $4 which we grudgingly obliged to do.  When the dish arrived, it was not in fact the vegetarian version we had ordered which we discovered as we started to dish it onto our plates.  They did replace the item promptly, but also snatched our plates with the food that had already been dished by the non-vegetarians which at that point seemed petty and wasteful.  I genuinely hope the front of the house and the chef tone down the attitude, because I'm sad to say it's going to take a while before I'm up to eating here again."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL!
Best food on my trip so far. The calamari appetizer was astonishingly good. My polenta and my dining companion's pork chop were perfectly cooked, full flavored and just delicious. Service was warm, courteous and on point. Thank you Flying Fig for putting paid to the claims of Cleveland's burgeoning culinary offerings."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place gets good reviews. I love stopping by for cocktails or coffee and dessert, but in terms of food, it's nothing super special to me. It's definitely way over priced and tiny! A friend and I try a sampler of 3 appetizers and it wasn't enough for both of of to taste! The gnocchi came in a espresso cup for the love of Pete!!! Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent nice atmosphere. Second time there will diffently go again"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of the Fig for years - close to about the time they opened. They make fantastic drinks (their Espresso Martini was a phenomenon before most bars had even heard of it) and the food is about as good as it gets. Karen Small, the Chef-Owner, is a true star in the locavore movement and is a genius with her ingredients. The menu changes seasonally and now with the $20 for 3 Tuesdays, this make things even more affordable. The brunch on Sundays is worth waking up for! Service is always polite and attentive without being too friendly or chirpy as some places try to be. I can't say enough good things about the Fig. Oh wait...there's the really nice patio for the Spring/Summer/Fall time!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Flying Fig for a long time, however last night's mediocre experience may have changed that. Is the food still good? Yes, but the menu is tired. It's the same dishes that have been listed all year. The appetizer special? Mushroom soup - now that's some creative cuisine!. Time for an update. Although the menu has become a bit boring, the worse part of last night was the service. It was just plain bad. We spent most of our time there waiting and not eating. It's not a good night when your evening consists of wondering when or if you might get food or see a server. We arrived at 7 PM, by 8 we had managed to score a drink, however we had yet to see any food, as a matter of fact we had yet to even order any food. The service at Flying Fig has always been average at best - it's the food that's kept us coming back. After last night's meal with the tired menu and bad service I'm not sure we have  a reason to return."}
{"text":"Said it before and I'll say it again:  I am not a foodie.  But my husband and I were visiting for the holidays and I wanted us to take a break from family and have a nice couples' dinner out.  After reviewing my available local \"nice\" but not \"uberfancy\" restaurant options, I picked Flying Fig, mostly because we could wear our jeans, the menu included burgers, and Lolita didn't seem to use OpenTable.   As it turned out, Flying Fig did not put one foot wrong all night with respect to our evening, so I was very happy with my choice and would definitely visit again. 

Although this place advertises itself as a bar first and restaurant second, everybody I know goes there primarily to eat interesting food.  Not that the cocktails aren't good but there are lots of other places if you just want a drink.  The dining area is small at the Flying Fig, but on this weeknight it was packed for about two hours at dinner time.  I would add that due to the small size of the room, \"packed\" equated to very very noisy to the point where you pretty much had to yell across the table to be heard, particularly since the next table had about five drunk young women whooping and hollering over their plates.  It quieted down considerably after about 7:30 pm.  If the food and service hadn't been so good, the noise level would have been bothersome, but since we had such a great meal otherwise I'm willing to overlook it.

We started with an appetizer of chorizo-stuffed dates which were totally yummy.  Then on to the entrees:  husband had a very fresh, very large cheeseburger with crispy fries (I stole a few and they were done just perfect and in particular were not limp), and I had a glazed pork shop nestled in some cheesy grits.  (Although we picked meaty meals, I noticed that there were also several vegetarian appetizer and entree choices on the menu, in addition to a couple of pedestrian sounding salads.)  

The food was super fresh and  absolutely excellent.  If everything at restaurants tasted this good, I just *might* have become a foodie.  Our waiter was also awesome, a total pro who really knew what he was doing, even though the place like I said was jammed and seemed to be understaffed.  

Dessert involved some homemade fig ice cream with the best cookies I have had in a restaurant in a long time.  Thank heaven not everybody makes their homemade ice cream the consistency of soft serve (this was hard the way I like it), nor makes their cookies soft (the chocolate chunk was crispy the way I like it, and warm from the oven).  The coffee was also among the best cups I have ever tasted in a restaurant and the waiter helpfully informed us they get it from City Roast right across the street.  Score for the locals.  

Be aware that  the portion size varies dramatically and a bit wildly.  We ordered one appetizer to split because we didn't know how big the plates would be and didn't want to end up ruining our dinners.  The appetizer turned out to be a small plate (three dates), and the dessert was also a reasonably small portion, but our entrees were GINORMOUS.  The pork chop I ate was so huge it was like the whole hind quarter of a piglet, and the waiter even said that the chops they were currently serving were much bigger than that dish used to be.   My husband, who usually has no trouble putting his meals away, couldn't finish his big portion of fries.  We took all the tasty leftovers home of course, and ate them up next day, but if you're planning to consume a whole dinner here, I'd suggest you bring your appetite."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Flying Fig, and it was quite a disappointment. The food was as splendid as my first visit, but the service left much to be desired. The host was rather curt and not very welcoming. Our server, Dave, seemed unappreciative of us asking questions about the menu. When I asked whether a salad was served with an entree, he said if I looked at the menu, it would specify whether or not a salad was included. I was quite offended by his tone. At no point during our visit did we receive a smile or any gesture that would make us want to return.

In the past, I raved about this restaurant and encouraged folks to give it a try. I definitely won't do that again, and it's highly unlikely I will return. Such a shame. I really liked the food and want to support local businesses."}
{"text":"We went to the fig for my husbands birthday. Overall, we had a great experience. I really enjoyed the design of menu and bar area. I did feel though, that the dining area fell flat. It was far less romantic feeling than the bar. 
Our drinks were fantastic, as was the service. We started with the spicy tomato soup which was outstanding. Followed it up with a molasses glazed pork loin. I very much enjoyed this dish. The locally grown pork had a nice flavor. My only discrepancy was that it was not cooked to specification. I asked for no pink at all, and it came to us with the center extremely pink. 
Overall, I would recommend a drink and an appetizer in the bar. Cute bar for the area."}
{"text":"Can we say underwhelming? The two of us dropped by for happy hour around 6:30 on a Wednesday night and shared the tempura green beans and the trio summer salad. To drink, I had the house white and the cava. My friend had a beer on tap. The drinks were fine, but the food was bland. The green bean fries were simultaneously greasy and lacking in flavor. What we mostly tasted was the oil. The summer salads were a potato green bean with pesto (which needed way more pesto, as it was dry), a mint zucchini concoction (probably the best of the three), and a roasted eggplant red pepper medley (which was passable). For dessert, we had the chocolate molten cake with fig ice cream. The ganache topping that was supposed to accompany it was nowhere to be found as was the moisture of the cake. Maybe we just need to stick to the regular menu, but I walked away unimpressed. For all this, we paid a bit less than $50, which isn't unsubstantial for a below average meal. Maybe there won't even be a next time."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Cleveland.  I used to go at least every other week when I lived there.  

To start, it is tucked in a cute little alley across from the Great Lakes Brewing Company and a wine bar whose name I can't remember....friendly to foot traffic and twinkling with lights that are strung across the sidewalk.  The patio is a divine place to enjoy a summer evening.  

The wine list is excellent and very reasonable, with many decent wines under $30.  Servers actually know a thing or two about the wine, as well!  If you're not a wine person, they have an interesting seasonal offering of beer as well, in addition to a full bar.

Now, the food.  Can we talk about the short rib for a sec?  Oh, man.  It's always on the menu in one form or another, and while the sauce and sides change, the meat is always the same, in all of it's tender, melt-in-your-mouth perfection, with its perfect crisp edges.  My husband and I love it so much that we finally, on our 100,000th visit, asked our waiter if we could have the recipe.  Amazingly, the chef came out and chatted with us about his short-rib-cooking technique for a good five minutes.  What service!

Other not-to-be-missed menu items: the bacon-wrapped dates, the seared scallops, the tempura green beans (which I know are sort of trendy, but FF does them exquisitely) and - save room! - the molten chocolate cake with fig ice cream.  (If you're too full for a big dessert, at LEAST get a scoop of the fig ice cream - it's fantastic!)

I miss Flying Fig so much now that I've moved away from Cleveland.  Truly a standout dining experience, even by big-city standards.  (And at half the price as it would cost if it were in NYC!)"}
{"text":"Great spot and creative menu. One of the best spots in town."}
{"text":"Food? Great. Drinks? Okay. Service? Ehhhhhhhh.

After placing our drink order, we finally received our drinks ten minutes later after having to ask a random employee to ask our server where our drinks were. We were seated in a booth right in front of the bar--we saw our drinks being made, we saw our drinks sitting there, and we saw our server stand at the bar in front of our drinks, ignoring them.

Our server never asked if we would like a round of drinks. This is Serving 101. Why would you not want to boost our check and your tip?

And lastly, after we finished eating, our server asked if he could bring us anything else and we said we were fine and ready for the check. He walks away, leaving all of our dirty dishes on the table. Comes back and drops the check, and continues to leave them on the table. Comes back and cashes us out, and still continues to leave them on the table. It's unsightly and bad service."}
{"text":"Only giving one star because I can't give zero.  Listen.  I called and made a reservation several days in advance.  They called to confirm the reservation which was nice; but, when we showed up the hostess did not have us on the list.  Hmm... interesting but they had several tables open so we were seated right away. Crisis averted right?  Not so fast.  We were not helped for 10 minutes.  We decided to leave and head to Momocho instead.  Momocho understood our situation and seated us right away despite a busy crowd.  Love Momocho. Hate the Fig.  There you have it.  Headed back to NYC Monday and will tell everyone we know about Momocho.  Sorry Fig.  You suck!"}
{"text":"Big big fan!  Local style in it's best form for a great night out."}
{"text":"The beet salad was a nice follow up to the cheese plate appetizer. The winter squash had great flavor"}
{"text":"A+ food, wine, and service. More vegetarian options than I remembered. Cleveland tofu dish was awesome.

Just one question: why the dump of a bathroom?"}
{"text":"Yelp reviews are so ridiculous sometimes. I glanced at this page before we went and was surprised to see some of the negative posts. A favorite spot that wasn't amazing once? 2 stars. Somewhere we didn't even eat? One star. Well, our meal was amazing. We loved each course. The Brussels sprouts were particularly fantastic. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I liked this place. It isn't one of my favorites, but I enjoyed myself several times here and tried quite a few different dishes. I like the location, and atmosphere. The service is nice. I can't say I was ever disappointed by anything I ordered, but neither was I awestruck. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ate brunch here and it was tasty! I ordered the corn cakes and the flavor was amazing. I made reservations via open table for 11:30am on a Sunday and I am glad I did. It was packed by noon. The decor is inviting and modern and the service was on point. Start your brunch with a great cup of coffee!
I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the Flying Fig last night and it was one word...AMAZING!!  I had the pork shoulder which was fall apart melt in your mouth tender. It was so delicious. My husband had the lamb shank and that was just as scrumptious!  My brother and sister-in-law both had vegetarian dishes and they loved every bite of their dishes. This restaurant is by far one of the BEST restaurants in Cleveland.  We will be back to eat here very soon :) what a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Oh man, let me tell you about the three bites of heaven: 1)smoky bacon 2)salty chorizo 3) end with a note of sweet dates. Literally three wrapped Medjool dates. Dive down under, visit the Gods of the sea with a gulp of dark stout or the pumpkin ale-Oh-so-smooth. Return to the grassland with the local beet salad: pickled beets, whipped cloverton, bits of eggwhites, pistachios, multigrain croutons, and honey vinaigrette. Skip the bland watered-down shrimp ginger coconut soup! 

You got to try the dark stout. Find me here-happy hour. 

Oh yes, setting: upper end-expect waiting on weekends. And they play good background music. \"Heart skipped a beat\" was on yo!

Note: don't ask for the \"pumpkin ale-Oh-so-smooth\". They don't carry that. Just pumpkin ale (they have two kinds)"}
{"text":"Great environment. Very good service. And the food is absolutely delicious! Local ingredients and house made ice cream.. Very cool place."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at the Flying Fig.  I brought some out-of-town work colleagues for a Friday night dinner.  The ambiance is nice.  Server was excellent and able to gauge the needs of our table.  Menu was focused.  Wine selection was fairly priced.  I ordered two nightly specials for appetizer and entree.  Shared a chocolate cake dessert.  All were excellent.  My guests enjoyed their meals as well.  Definitely a great spot I feel comfortable bringing guests."}
{"text":"On a whim, went to Flying Fig....it had been years since we ate there.  Sat at the bar and the bartender made PERFECT martinis.  We stayed at the bar for dinner and the flank steak was tender and perfectly prepared.  But the striped bass was outrageously delicious.  Just melted in your mouth.  The side order of Brussels sprouts was uniquely prepared and I could just eat them for dinner.  Karen Small more than lived up to her reputation to being a Top Chef in Cleveland (and the US)."}
{"text":"Corn cakes, burger, polenta. Seriously incredible. Service was better than I thought possible. I love you Flying Fig."}
{"text":"Truly worth it.

Visited on a Sunday night and was not in a hurry.

Eclectic farm to table menu. Not exactly haute cuisine but pretty freaking close.

Tremendous starters with sublime flavor pairings.

Superb entrees of a generous nature.

Desserts worthy of a legitimate course's attention.

The experience was a delight and worth every penny.

A table of three professional culinary \"Bozos\", who can be rather annoyingly critical, were more than impressed and intend to frequent the aforementioned.

{"text":"Three family members entertained a cousin from out of town and had a lovely dinner and visit thanks to the staff at Flying Fig.  We ordered appetizers, dinner, dessert and drinks and enjoyed every bite.  ARTISANAL CHEESE BOARD, BACON WRAPPED MEDJOOL DATES, TEMPURA GREEN BEANS, GARLIC RUBBED TOAST, STUFFED ACORN SQUASH, PAN SEARED WALLEYE, ICE CREAM SANDWICH, WARM SEASONAL FRUIT & GRAHAM CRACKER CRUMBLE with Vanilla Ice Cream.  I had a great Long Island Ice Tea while others had some delicious wine.  I appreciated that the Flying Fig posts their menu online and we were able to preview food and prices.  We had a wonderful time.  Thank you Flying Fig."}
{"text":"Sunday evening dinner reservation for four...

Seated immediately, attentive but not overbearing service.

Started with bacon-wrapped dates and a dish of olives.  Dates were served on a nice tomato-based puree and were good, but not great.  I don't dig olives, but others at the table seemed pleased.

Dishes for four... I had the Rock Shrimp Risotto, wife had the hangar steak, and the two guests both had the pork shoulder.

If there's a better risotto out there, please tell me.  Shrimp were on the small side, but well-balanced with the corn-bacon-creamy risotto.  Topped off by (again) smallish but tasty mussels.  All-together, a perfect portion for an entree. Good stuff.

Everyone else raved about their meals.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good place to hang out after work and have a few beers and a burger , food and beer prices are reasonable. Easy parking and the folks are locals and friendly."}
{"text":"We just ate there tonight and the food was really good but that is only part of the experience the service was way below average and the noise level was so high no one could hear each other and we were seated in the area that the hostess said was the least noisy. Our waiter was rude, obnoxious, and really should not be a server. He had the gall to ask us if we were finally ready to give up the olive appetizer after he repeatealy asked us to take it away when we asked him not to.
We saw the high rating and was really looking forward to trying this restaurant we have experienced many of the other restaurants in this area and have found them to be really good. We will choose one of them before experiencing this restaurants bad service again."}
{"text":"I'm back in Cleveland visiting with the folks. P.S. Preseason Cavs games are cheap entertainment. My Pops wanted to go to B Spot. I suggested we find something new on yelp and go there. My mom is a dietary nut and can only eat wheat grass that is totally organic and was raised under only the most ethical conditions.

We arrived and found the setting/ambiance acceptable. I'm not big on appearances. I would eat great food in a mud hole and be content. The restaurant is semi dark with ample seating, blah, blah, blah.

I ordered the Pork shoulder with collard greens, corn bread, and a sour cherry/bourbon reduction. My Dad got a bowl of steamed muscles, clams, and scallops. Mom got the steak with purple potatoes. The food was excellent. We passed around the dishes and ate from each other's plates. The Pork Shoulder stole the show. The greens were amazing and were carefully prepared with some toasted corn kernels and candied bacon. The sour cherry and bourbon reduction sauce was of a high enough caliber that I would consider drinking it by itself. Furthermore, the appetizers were EPIC! CHICKEN LIVERS WITH CHEESE GRITS AND CANDIED BACON. GOAT CHEESE STUFFED DATES WRAPPED IN BACON. Need I say anything more?

Overall, the quality of the food justifies spending twenty something dollars per plate. The only issue I had was the lack of table bread and the small portion of steamed seafood. For $8.00 you could purchased a platter of four or five different breads with an olive tapenade and humus, but I didn't really want all that. Perhaps if I could simply purchase just one half loaf, I wouldn't find Flying Figs bread service so unwieldy. 

Great Meal. Solid Restaurant"}
{"text":"My fav restaurant in cleveland. Hands down. Always tasty, always great service. Chef/owner Karen has it figured out."}
{"text":"The husband and I went here on a rainy Saturday afternoon for some lunch.  Much to our suprise they had a wonderful brunch menu.  We had the pork shoulder sandwich which was awesome.  Also, I am a big fan of the farm to table concept.  The meat was from a local farm in Chardon.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My aunt and I went to flying fig last Saturday about 9:30pm without a reservation. To be honest we were out all day and didn't think of making one. We were seated without a problem. Started with a pinot noir from Oregon and the chicken liver starter. Absolutely delicious, chicken liver with grits, apple slivers, and arugula. I had the rock shrimp risotto and my aunt had the duck breast. Both were A+ dishes. We shared the molten chocolate cake with fig ice cream. I did not taste any fig in the ice cream, but it was still delicious."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that the best meal I ever had in 3 years of living in Cleveland came at the Flying Fig. Its ever-rotating menu tends to be somewhat paralyzing; normally I order food at a glance, but when I go there, I usually end up constructing a meal out of multiple small plates because so many things look good. The one thing I will say that keeps it from being perfect is that, based on the last time I went there, it's become more popular/crowded and the noise level has gone up dramatically; the lower-key ambiance it had before was part of the charm. Definitely try to go on an off-peak night if possible."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious, service good. 

My husband swears by their duck breast - it's the best we've ever tried, and he's tried it in many Cleveland restaurants, and we've been to Beynac and Soulliac in France = duck country. And Flying Fig still is the best. I've been a vegetarian for about a year now, and their veggie options are great.

Wonderful that they incorporate so many of locally grown products into their kitchen, and they've been doing before it was cool to be sustainable. 

Just a great restaurant, whether for a nice romantic evening out, or an evening with friends. Wouldn't go there if you're looking for a casual, quick bite."}
{"text":"So glad we came to the Flying Fig for our new year's dinner. Service was warm and friendly, and we never felt rushed. Best part was the food! The Faroe Island salmon was the best I've ever had, the chicken schnitzel was great and the  dinner could have easily served two and the lamb and chorizo meatballs were delicious, too. We have always loved this restaurant, but they exceeded our expectations this time!!!"}
{"text":"BEST GREYHOUND OF MY LIFE (and that is my go-to drink).  I got the veggie huevos rancheros dish, which was good, but not as mind-blowing as my greyhound.   The baked apples were pretty good too.  Server was very knowledgable and VERY helpful for the variety of dietary restrictions at the table."}
{"text":"I have eaten here multiple times over the years and have never been disappointed.  This is the type of place where you want to bring people from out of town and show them how foodies love C-town.

Some people complain the prices are high.  I don't agree.  We always have fantastic food, great service and know their items are as local as you can buy.  My only complaint, and it is what it is, is the noise level.   They have seating outside when the North Coast weather cooperates, and being in the midst of Market Square reminds you of the great things the CLE has to offer.

The Flying Fig menu is always innovative and I can't wait to try the new combos of ingredients.  I would never have thought to combine apple butter with brie on a sandwich.  I do now!

I particularly love their Sunday Brunch.  Nothing like great food with a mimosa!  Entrees range from $9 - $15 and their portions are huge.  When I go for brunch I typically don't need to eat dinner.

Flying Fig and Bar Cento are my two favorite spots in Ohio City.  While neither has the popularity of Great Lakes Brewing Company, if you want good food, avoid GLBC and walk across the street."}
{"text":"The Flying Fig was a last minute decision hoping to get a reservation which we did. The appetizer of dates was phenomenal with a sweet and spicy combo. The rest of our food was scrumptious but those dates just stood out to me. Our drinks were delicious as well and our server was attentive and kind. I would definitely go back to this small, delicious eatery."}
{"text":"The food was great but the snotty service we received was not worth it. Sent my thoughts through their Facebook page over a week ago and never received a response. Pathetic customer service. I will not return."}
{"text":"I  went to Flying Fig for brunch by myself. That took some guts, but the server was appropriately attentive and made me comfortable. I had the French toast and man was it good. It didn't really need any accompaniment, but I really liked the jam, butter and syrup that they provided, as well as the cinnamon mascarpone that was served with it. I wasn't as excited about the sausage that it came with, but it wasn't bad. I guess I should have gone with bacon. I sincerely hope I have the opportunity to return for dinner some time and to have that French toast again."}
{"text":"I like the Flying Fig.   Have been a number of times for Happy Hour.  Great burger.  Tasty fries with spicy aioli.   Sippable cocktail specials.

Like an old, reliable friend, Flying Fig doesn't wow me any more, but it's always there when I need it."}
{"text":"Went here because of the buzz from other Yelpers. While we weren't disappointed per se, both my wife and I felt the food here lacked inspiration -- even if it was technically prepared as advertised. Hard to put my finger on, but the food here just lacked the small details that set a five star review apart from the rest.

Started with the chorizo stuffed, bacon wrapped dates. A great start: flavorful, just the right amount of sweet with the kick of chorizo. Also had the tempura green beans: these were undercooked and a bit too stiff, having had these numerous times elsewhere at other restaurants.

My dish was the steak, a bone in strip: I'm a Texan, and in Texas we let the steak speak for itself. Here, they drowned this thing in butter. Flavorful, but I kept trying to get past the heavy butter to taste the beef. The side dishes served with the steak, while generally well prepared, were pedestrian: chopped and seasoned potatoes, and asparagus that, like the green beans, was undercooked.

My wife had the lamb. Again, solid but unspectacular: plated like you might at home, and with some heavy grains & cream that might be s mismatch with such a rich meat.

Service was prompt, friendly; not too crowded for main suppertime during a Sat night. Would I go back next time I'm in Cleveland? Probably not, but not because we had a bad experience -- just that there are better options (Lola, for example)."}
{"text":"Service was slow and inattentive.  
The food was average and overpriced.
When we mentioned the food was subpar the server got very defensive and said it was our problem.   Never again."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch sandwiches at the market. Nice find while visiting the area. Really helpful and friendly staff."}
{"text":"My dish was pretty tasty. A tad on the lighter side, but I left full. Drinks were mixed to perfection. Ambient atmosphere that would make for a good date."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited for Sunday brunch .... Needless to say we want to come back every week for Sunday brunch! Knowing the handsome Tony and Klint to back up the rep of this restaurant there was nothing more then amazement to happen after we settled down with our HOMEMADE CINNABUNS and HOMEMADE APPLE BUTTER! 
Let me tell you all this place is delicious! Highly recommend the Huevos Rancheros. Not only is this a rare dish but a beautiful display as well! And don't forget to stop next door at their quaint little supermarket and pick up some local foods to take home!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. I was just in recently on a saturday night and I enjoyed it so much I came back for brunch 14 hours later! Service is excellent. Seems like they have had the same wait staff for 10 years now. The food is fantastic. Clean, simple and local. Make sure to have the tempura green beans. I think its one of the few staples that's always on the menu. Menu changes frequently. Go support the fig, it truly is great."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch with the family was our first dining experience at  the FF.  We arrived shortly after noon and were surprised at how empty the restaurant was. We had our choice of seating and opted to sit in the rear of the restaurant near the kitchen since there were two young children in our party. 
The waitstaff were very friendly and competent, and certainly deserving of as much praise as the food. 
We ordered Tempura Battered String Beans to start. The batter was light and crispy, the string beans were cooked perfectly, and the accompanying sauces gave it just enough flavor to complement the dish. My 6 year old couldn't get enough of it. 
My wife ordered the Migas, which she thoroughly enjoyed. Needless to say, I didn't get to sample any of her dish. She gave her nod of approval. My 6 year old ordered the Buttermilk Pancakes and Sausages. Four blueberry pancakes were served with two nice sized linked sausages. My younger one was a bit more generous so I was able to sample the pancakes and sausages. I will simply quote what he said about the dish: \"these are the best tasting 'city' pancakes and sausages, but not as good as the best 'country' pancakes and sausages.\" My 9 year old and I both ordered the Grilled Short Ribs. WOW!!! They were fabulous. Two generous cuts of short ribs served with a heaping side of fries, fennel slaw and horseradish sauce. The short ribs were cooked perfectly. Slightly crispy on the outside, and incredibly tender and moist on the inside; packing plenty of rich meaty flavor. The horseradish sauce and fennel slaw were both excellent, each complementing and balancing out the rich flavor of the meat. I only wish a larger portion of the slaw was served. My 9 year old enjoyed it as much as I did. He was so full from the meat and slaw, he didn't even eat the fries, which was a surprise given how much he likes fries.
We left feeling completely satiated after our meal, eager to return to sample their lunch and dinner menus. My 6 year old gave the FF 'Two Big Thumbs Up' and has made a special request to return for round two next weekend."}
{"text":"We think this restaurant is probably really good for brunch but not as much for dinner.  Two of our party ordered salmon since they were out of walleye.  One was over-cooked.  The other was o.k. but not a lot of taste and no seasoning.  We all thought the $32 price was extremely high for the salmon plate.  Both the polenta and hanger steak dishes were excellent.  We did not feel overly welcome there.  Happily our next stop for drinks nearby was phenomenal and made up for this so-so meal."}
{"text":"I went yesterday for brunch which is every Saturday and Sunday from 11-3. We went around 2pm so there was no wait and we were seated promptly. The atmosphere is a little more upscale which I liked. It is right across from Great Lakes brewery so if you're thirsty afterwards it's a bonus for you! I ordered the croquet madam which was amazing and I would definitely order again! My friend got the frittata which I tried and just thought it was ok, but huge portion!! They also have a different frittata everyday so I thought that was cool. It came in a cute cast iron skillet which was creative as a serving dish. I loved the bread and apple butter, great way to start off a fall brunch in my eyes. All in all its my new favorite brunch spot when I'm out that way to go to the Westside market!"}
{"text":"Yes, it is a small plate but maybe be too small for CLE appetites. Food was tastey, and it was perfectly prepared, but wish there was more of it. Service and drinks were great. Excellent establishment for special occasion or weekend meal - just order multiple apps."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, but still haven't eaten. I am giving it the third star because I anticipate that the food is good. The first time I came here, the kitchen was closing in 5 minutes for brunch and lunch wasn't starting for a while. I hate ordering right at the end, so I held off. I had some drinks that were good. 

The second time I came here, I joined my friends who had already ordered. It was very full and it took upwards of 10 minutes for the server to come take a drink order, so I just went to the bar. Which still took a really long time to get a drink from. I was annoyed at that point and didn't feel like waiting forever for food so I just didn't order any. 

So if I can manage to get here when the kitchen is open and they aren't so slammed, I am sure it will be better."}
{"text":"Great food but bad experience with the service.My mother has serious food allergies and the waitress did not seem concerned or willing to help. After almost every meal coming out incorrect and an eye roll from the waitress we called management. They took a round of drinks off and were apologetic however I will not be going back. If you have any type of food allergy I would not recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"It's worth going here just for the olives! Every time I go they are slightly different and always good! Service is good as well and they are very happy to change something if I request it. 

Also stopped in their Market last week and they were nice enough to tell me how to make onion soup and get enough for me!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch on a saturday while in town with family and we were not disappointed. I had the huevos rancheros, the pork was tender, the spices were perfect and not overpowering, and the portion was very generous. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive. I also had a sour cherry mimosa which was great. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great service. Nice wine list. Scallops, polenta and chicken paillard excellent. Brandied fig ice cream!"}
{"text":"I was quite impressed by this place. The only reason for the 4 star is the price. The portions are just right but the price is high. The drinks are made proper. We found a reservation easily at last minute on the weekend."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had since coming to cleveland. The meatball appetizer was amazing along with the gnocchi I had for my entree. I feel like this is a place you can't go wrong with anything off the menu. We will definitely be back to try out some more stuff. The service was incredible as well. Our waiter was on top of things, checked in regularly and very informative of the menu and specials."}
{"text":"The Fig is a well rounded restaurant that allows you to try pretty much anything off the menu and walk away totally happy. Go ahead, pick something. It's a very thoughtful collection of entrees that has something for everyone. 

In the summer, the outdoor area is a great people watching watching spot."}
{"text":"Of course only my opinion-but this is hands down the best restaurant in Cleveland.  Karen is a genius.  This place is welcoming and friendly, never stuffy!  The food is flavorful, and they are locally and sustainably minded.  You must dine here if you're hungry in Ohio City!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this restaurant (especially since my friend paid for me!) but there are a few reasons I give this place a 4 instead of a 5:

Food:
- Market at the Fig Cheese Plate: I suppose we should have looked at the description more carefully, but I wasn't too happy that we only got 2 types of cheese on \"cheese plate.\" They were good, but I wished it was more.
- Roasted Local Winter Squash: The food is served inside the squash. Absolutely delicious, filling, and pleasing to the eye.
- House special of some white fish or other: Excellent meal. The wild rice was excellent, the fish cooked to perfection, and a little bit of grapefruit chutney added to the dish, done tastefully.
- Cheesecake: It was interesting. It had a different texture compared to the traditional cheesecake. My friend and I both thought it was good, but not great.
- Cocktails: We got the chaitini and the pear martini. I thought they were both great. The chaitini tasted like chai tea. I thought I would like it better than I actually did, which is no fault of the restaurant's. The pear martini, I thought was amazing!!!

Atmosphere:
I liked the fact that the huge space was divided into rooms to subdue the noise level a little bit. It was still a little noisy for me, but I guess some people like that.

Service:
Our waitor was very attentive and came by often. (I'm actually not a big fan of the waitor stopping by too often and asking every time we get something whether it's good.) We got everything we asked for, our water glasses were always filled promptly, and we got our check when we wanted it. 

In summary, we didn't love everything on the menu and other patrons were loud, but this is a solid restaurant and I will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"When my husband was looking for a date night restaurant, yelp users sealed the deal on his decision to take us to The Flying Fig. Boy, am I grateful!

The Flying Fig was fabulous in every way. It's not quite formal enough for an anniversary or Valentine's day, but not casual enough for an everyday night out- which makes it a perfect first date restaurant or a great night out with friends. The waitstaff was very attentive and answered our questions in a way that wasn't pretentious, despite the fact that some of the items on the menu were a bit obscure.

The food was absolutely delicious. I ordered a steak dish with sides of asparagus and potatoes au gratin. My husband ordered a pork dish wrapped in pancetta. Although I can't recall the details of the sauces, they were all unique, yet not overpowering. 

My only complaint is that the decor was lacking a bit. The lighting was nice, but sometimes low lighting is a clever way to hide a dull atmosphere. No worries, though- you can always hop across the street to the wine bar for nicer ambiance."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, our first and likely- only- experience here was less than ideal. Our waitress seemed put out from the very beginning of ordering. Severe food allergies to simple changes in multiple burger dinners went VERY awry! Long story short. Less than wonderful service, I never got my meal BUT the manager- Brian??- was very kind and truly did try to resolve the situation. Unfortunately, we waited too long to involve him and by that point we were ready to head out and salvage our celebratory evening! I think this was a single experience and not necessarily a true representation of the restaurant, but..if you are likely to want to alter or omit anything from what is listed on the plate, it might not go well."}
{"text":"\"Who put the bomp In the bomp bah bomp bah bomp?\" Don't know, just like I don't know who came up with an amazing beautiful delight known as a crispy poached egg! Served with creamy polenta, sauteed spinach and beautiful nuggets of taleggio, this was a bowl of tender lovin' goodness.  My Honey and I traded bites, and his  Migas  (not a euphemism, I promise) locally farmed eggs, with scallions, tortilla strips with their house-made chorizo should not be missed also.  Fresh squeezed juice is always good for a Sunday morning Mimosa, so hurry and get yourself here STAT!"}
{"text":"A trendy restaurant that serves delicious fare based largely on locally-sourced foods. As such, the menu changes often depending on availability. Flying Fig has one of my favorite happy hours in Cleveland. The burger is one of the best around, and has a lot going on-- onion rings, aioli, bacon, cheese and generously portioned. The drinks are delicious and similarly locally-sourced. Most recently, the happy hour special was a strawberry lemonade cocktail made with Ohio strawberries. 

Overall, one of the best happy hours in Cleveland. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The best meal we've had in Cleveland in a long time.

Friends suggested the Flying Fig.  These are the same friends we have dined with a L'Albatros, Table 45 and a number of other notable Cleveland eateries.  Those places are good; this place is better.

The food is interesting, well presented and simply delicious.

We started with the tempuraed green beans, the dates, and a special appetizer we don't remember.  Then it was on to a magnificent sea bass, the vegetable plate, a salmon special and a pork confit special.  All were well prepared with outstanding sides that were both tasty and complimentary to the mains they accompanied.  Every ingredient was fresh, apparently locally sourced and properly cooked."}
{"text":"As a discerning foodie and large fan of the Cleveland restaurant scene, I don't say this lightly: Flying Fig is by far my favorite restaurant in the city.  I've been here about a dozen times (all for dinner) since moving to the area 2.5 years ago, and it is my go to place for bringing out-of-town friends and family. 

In terms of food, I've never had a bad meal. They take such care when preparing the plates, and it's just... delicious. (Important side note - if they ever bring it back, get the duck.  Flying Fig is the only place in the city that will actually cook it medium rare, and it's mind-blowing. The fact that it was recently struck from the menu is a shame.) Their local beet salad is a must, and the charcuteries plate is consistently adorable. The drinks are always stiff, which is pretty much my standard for a good one.  Their specialty cocktails are all around $10, but when factoring in the amount of alcohol, it's a bargain. 

The location is great - being in Ohio city allows you and your friends to go out afterwards without having to drive.

Only tiny negative things: there's nothing special about the decor, and since a busy waiter station divides the bar and dining areas, the atmosphere can be interrupted if you sit in the wrong seat. There's a circular booth right across from this station - I recommend you avoid it.  From what I can tell, the music is just someone's personal playlist or Pandora station, so it rarely adds to the experience.  But everything else is amazing. Go here, now!"}
{"text":"The food here is a 5, but the service drops it.  Took forever to get our drinks, slow response to take orders, seemed not to care when we were just having a couple appetizers and drinks.  The last place we went to was totally cool about it, but this \"small eatery\" seemed let down and no, they were not packed.

But the food made up for it.  The figs, which seemed to be the only use of figs at the Flying \"Fig\", were awesome and just perfect heat with sweet.  The cheese flatbread was so good and the tomatoes were awesomely sweet.  Both our salads were good, but my wife is still talking about her beer salad.  The food here is a 5."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch, food was amazing! They had a very creative take on brunch but everything worked together wonderfully. Service made me and the rest of the table feel a little awkward and they also messed up several aspects of the order. Even with the problems with service still a wonderful meal and would return time and time again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Flying Fig last night and were delighted with the experience. We started with the cheese plate special (figs stuffed with blue cheese wrapped in prosciutto) and the warmed olives. Both were to die for, but I was particularly impressed with the olives. A dish of olives can be unexciting, but the variety of olives as well as the seasoning were outstanding. 

My husband had the Duck Confit which was served with duck sausage and spaetzle. It was very good. I had the lamb loin wrapped in pancetta which was served with horseradish mashed turnips. The loin was tender and flavorful, and the mashed turnips were light and tasty. 

The service was good, if not a little slow, but overall the experience was among the best we have had in Cleveland (up there with Dante and Lola)."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  This was one of my favorite spots in all of Cleveland for years.  This past weekend, we had the worst service and super disappointing entrees.  The evening started off great when the hostess worked with my wife and I as we debated finding the right seat on the patio (seasonal midges had made one two-top table less desirable, so she seated us at a four-top).  Unfortunately, the evening went down from there.  Our waitress not only couldn't speak to any of the drinks or menu items, and seemed almost depressed to be waiting on us (or the surrounding table).  At one point, we asked her to recommend a cocktail, and she responded with, \"eh, I guess it's okay.\"  As the meal went on, our orders were messed up, culminating in a sub-par presentation of the \"Grit Cakes\" entree, which seemed completely out of place for a restaurant of this stature and reputation.  I'm hopeful this was a one - time hick up and that the corrections can be made to keep the Fig as one of Cleveland's best dining destinations."}
{"text":"We have never been disappointed with our experience here.  Brunch is also great.  Flying fig is a must try... again and again!!!

Always great specials and friendly service.  They just seem to enjoy what they do and it comes through in the food."}
{"text":"a home away from home. 

always good, always great service, they seem to collect the clevo hotties and i love being waited on by a hottie, male or female.

great for a date or in the party room with a group.

fresh ingredients. just a great time all around."}
{"text":"The best food I've had in Cleveland thus far. The Cocktails were solid and the duck was even better."}
{"text":"I've had Flying Fig on my to do list for awhile now.  Meal included: Dates stuffed with House-made Chorizo, Wrapped in Smoked Bacon - OK, Salad - Good, Pork Entree - Pork was cooked properly and very moist and the best bread pudding I have had in a very long time.  I'm only giving it 3 stars because I was not wow'd from start to finish and for the $$$ I think I should have left feeling it was worth it."}
{"text":"One of my favorites when in Cleveland.  The staff is knowledgeable and the food is always good with local ingredients.  Always something new and unique on the menu.  Casual atmosphere and dress.  Great place to go before a play or game."}
{"text":"I went here for my monthly dinner with one of my good friends, and it was absolutely delicious. We started off with the Tempura Green Beans, and they were to die for. I highly recommend them (unless you don't like \"fried foods\", which is what my friend said when we got them at our table, so I ate most of them no problem). I ordered the Roasted Faroe Island Salmon, which was also so good. I am not a mustard person at all, but the mustard vinaigrette that it was in might have changed my mind. I wish I would have had room for dessert at the end, but the food was just so good that I finished it all and didn't have room for any. Maybe next time I go back!"}
{"text":"Had the biscuits and gravy which have seen micheal symon suggest.  It was awesome!  Corned beef sandwich was good also that husband had. Portions are just right.  Price was fine for such great taste   Will be back"}
{"text":"I'm definitely fatter after last night.

At Kimberly K.'s suggestion, I tried the egg nog martini.  Words cannot describe.  I usually don't drink bourbon, but this drink went all the way dowwwn.

I had the Ohio Beef Burger (very reasonable at $15), with buttermilk blue cheese and bacon.  It came with a side of extremely delicious fries which came close to Bar Cento's...almost.  Definitely had rosemary in them, which I love.  They also included some house-made pickles, which were surprisingly sweet.  I have a feeling the ketchup was also made in house, because it came in one of those mini-side dishes and just tasted so different and fresh.  But I was too embarrassed to ask our server.

My husband had a trio of small plate ($24) which included tofu with lentils, rice, and harissa yogurt; fried polenta; and mushroom gnocchi.  He enjoyed everything (and only gave me a bite of the tofu, the bastard).

We were actually too stuffed for dessert.  Like I said, definitely fatter.

Will return!"}
{"text":"Dessert pushed this 4 star review to 5!  So let's review this in reverse. 

Finished with 2 desserts on their special board, the spice cake and vegan salty caramel ice cream. Our waitress, who told me earlier in the evening if I didn't like the cab, she would drink it, said the same does not hold true for the vegan ice cream. But 8 had to try it, especially since I have a lactose intolerant daughter, always lining for safe alternatives. I'm here to tell you, it was excellent!  Though, the spice cake was out of this world. You could have told me the icecream was made out of mother's milk and I wouldn't know the difference. 

For dinner, we had baked rigatoni and chicken schnitzel. The pasta was good, as was the bird, but it was really nothing more than a fried chicken sandwich. 

Service was fast and friendly. Limited menu, so not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"The fig never disappoints. 

A friend and I came here for the Yelp Eats discount on the green beans. I wanted to share my love and it was successful! We also shared the smoked turkey sandwich--mouth watering delicious. It's great the next day, too! Homemade pickles?! SOLD. Also, the dirty bird martini is excellent--I just love martinis and this is one of the best I've found yet.

And, once again, the staff and service were great!!"}
{"text":"The bacon wrapped dates with smoked paprika and chorizo is truly an intriguing and bold flavored adventure.  A MUST order.  Also had the grass fed burger which was decent.  Oh, and the banana salted caramel ice cream with french toast dessert was outstanding!!!!!!  Friendly staff and super cool décor make this place a winner.  Big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local restaurants. Great patio seating. Their happy hour is one of the best in Cleveland."}
{"text":"My wife and I have come here about a half dozen times since we moved to Cleveland and I can honestly say I've never had even a mediocre meal here.  They have the most attentive servers, a great happy hour menu, custom crafted drinks, a fantastic menu...and the most killer green bean appetizer you'll find anywhere!

We've loved a number of other dishes over the years.  They make a great burger, mussels, steaks, chops.  Salads are always fresh and full of unique ingredients.  This last time we tried a meatball appetizer that was full of flavor with a tangy red sauce.

What more can i say...explore the menu, try a cocktail then sit back and relax.  You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"My first visit here was great! (I even posted a yummy yelp photo of my huevos rancheros with a bloody mary from that day). Granted that visit was over a year ago.... the recent rumors/bad reviews are true. It really is too bad, because this place is nestled right in the heart of such a cute area in Ohio City with all the potential in the world. I can attest to the accuracy of 2 other reviews stating a terrible experience involving a huge, live, bug wiggling around in my friend's salad (not to mention the original order was wrong to begin with, live bug not included). One of these reviews has been flagged from the Yelp filter (hey, they can't get them all right). The way it was handled was COMPLETELY unprofessional and downright insulting. Manager and waitress both gave zero f*cks and when she asked for a small slice of carrot cake in lieu of said-bug-infested-salad, it was dry and \"meh\" and they still charged her for ALL ITEMS. Excuse me, what? This is a restaurant. When there are live bugs in your food, you either replace or comp the dish. Or even if you don't, at least offer an APOLOGY and replace it with a bug-free version??

Get your act together, guys. It really is a shame that this place has gone to waste."}
{"text":"Corn and Andouille hot cakes for brunch will never do you wrong! I've been coming here for years - great food, especially for brunch since it's affordable!"}
{"text":"5 stars is an easy decision. I don't get to come here much ($$$$$) but I have had wonderful meals when I do. 

The first time I came here was after I was dumped...My dad wanted to take his little girl someplace nice. I was coming from the East side and got off the shoreway on w.28. It isn't super easy to make a left there and I was stopped for a few minutes. While stopped, a woman came over and tried to get in my car. Luckily, I am always expecting this and locked the door as soon as I saw her make a move (I have had this happen to me, for some reason, like 10 times). Once again, I thwarted a crazy woman from getting into my car. This did not make her happy, so she turned around and began slapping her backside. I looked in horror, which really did not make her happy, so she pulled up her jean skirt and pushed her bare bottom against my car window. Luckily, traffic cleared and I was able to make my turn without seeing any more body parts. 

What does this have to do with the flying fig review you ask? A lot. 
1) don't come that way unless you want to see crazy lady body parts
2) take your daughter to the Flying Fig when she gets dumped. She will always appreciate it."}
{"text":"This is my fourth time here so it is time for a review. 

The salads and vegetables here are stars. I am not a big vegetable guy but this place elevates them.  

Had the local beet salad with honey vinaigrette with walnuts and 6 minute egg. Absolutely stellar. 

The bacon wrapped medjool dates are very good but I think One Red Door does it better.  

The New Creations pork loin with shredded Brussel sprouts and corn mushroom bread pudding in a sour cherry reduction was really outstanding.  The pork was flavorful and tender, the Brussel sprouts were top notch with crispy pork belly and almonds mixed in. 

Had the butterscotch budino for dessert. A champagne flute of butterscotch pudding with a caramel sea salt layer and whipped cream with a little shortbread style cookie. A little too much whipped cream but otherwise a solid ending to a great meal.

Have had a couple meals here in 2014 that were a little underwhelming."}
{"text":"Having been charged with deciding on a venue for my birthday dinner with my wife, I asked myself a series of questions: explore uncharted waters or stick to the classics? Somewhere in the neighborhood or a little farther out? Something light or artery-clogging?  Lola, Pier W, and Crop Bistro were a few of the names thrown around, but ultimately we decided on returning to the Flying Fig.  Honestly, my last meal here had not been mind-blowing, but that was my fault--I'd succumbed to the siren song of the fish special, which is never, ever as good as you want it to be.  This time, I decided, I'd stick with what the Fig purportedly does best: seasonal, locally sourced, farm-to-table delights.

We arrived ten minutes before our 6:00 reservation, but we were seated immediately.  Our server, whose name eludes me, was very helpful and honest, and he made sure we didn't have any misconceptions about the size of the small starters we were considering.  With his guidance, we decided on sharing a bottle of 2010 Muirwood Pinot Noir as well as the charcuterie and cheese board.  The wine, to our admittedly unrefined palates, was on point, and the meat and cheese board could not have been better.  I'm not literate enough in charcuterie or cheese to rattle off a comprehensive list of the offerings, but I can tell you they included Spanish chorizo, prosciutto, manchego, brie, and a variety of accoutrements like local honey, dates, berries, and almonds, and that each of them was delicious.  The portion size was perfect for sharing, and while we had no trouble polishing off the board, we still had ample room for the entrees coming our way.

And thank god for that, because these entrees were the star of the show.  My wife ordered the herbed gnocchi with chicken confit, and it was excellent; the gnocchi practically melted in your mouth, and the chicken confit was pure salty goodness.  I ordered the confit of Ohio pork shoulder, a giant hunk pork confit slathered in peach BBQ sauce and served over collard greens, with skillet cornbread on the side.  The skillet cornbread was great, if a little dry, and the collard greens were fantastic, but the pork was some next-level shit.  It was rich, salty, and so tender that it practically fell apart when I poked it with my fork.  I raved about it all night, and even thinking of it now is making me salivate.  I'd better stop.

The meal wasn't done, however.  Graciously accepting our server's offer of dessert menus, we settled on the toddy 'n' cream, which consists of toddy-brewed iced coffee poured over vanilla ice cream.  It tasted like the best coffee ice cream I'd ever had.  The portion could have been larger, but then again, we could have (and should have) each gotten our own.  

This wasn't the perfect dining experience.  Although I didn't experience any of the rudeness or negligence that some other Yelpers have alluded to, I did find the time between courses to verge on the ridiculous, especially given the small number of diners in the establishment.  Still, the food was amazing, the wait staff were helpful and friendly, if not speedy, and the prices were reasonable, considering the quality of the fare.  Given the growing number of excellent dining options in the area that I'm determined to try, I can't say we'll be back soon, but if I dwell on that pork shoulder long enough, I just might change my mind."}
{"text":"Sad to say I haven't been to \"the Fig\" in a long time.  We went to celebrate a friend's birthday. As always, the food is outstanding, and the lac or combinations are delicious and interesting.  I think this place is THE place to go for the best pork in town.  The pork shoulder was flavorful and it fell apart so easily.  The short ribs were excellent, too.  The burrata cheese appetizer with olive tapenade...killer.  Service was super attentive.  Our server even brought our dessert out with a candle in it,  nice touch.  Always a good idea to make a reservation.  And their happy hour during the week is very popular."}
{"text":"Flying Fig was the restaurant of choice for my birthday trip to Cleveland. The menu looked perfect with a lot of local, health options. With just 2 of us we did not have to make a reservation for a Friday night (but it may be recommended to call ahead). We walked in, got seated, and were greeted shortly after. 

I wanted Flying Fig to exceed my expectations, and it could easily have if the service had been on par! However, our waiter just was not pleasant. He didn't ask if we were celebrating anything, didn't smile, he didn't even tell us his name... I was really disappointed because it just was not a friendly encounter. After getting our drinks he was pretty abrupt on us ordering, even though we had barely any time to look over or ask questions. 

After said encounter, we chose to order a course meal to split that included an appetizer, entree, and dessert. The food... Oh my goodness, it was fantastic. We got a nice cauliflower hummus, curry dish, and cookies and ice cream for dessert (all vegan!). I would easily give the food a 5 star. I'd also like to try Flying Fig again and hope for the best with service."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots in Cleveland, hands down. Their huevos rancheros are to die for. Servers are friendly, knowledgable, and efficient. The huevos come with an amazing red sauce with a perfectly cooked egg on top. It's a hearty, filling dish and you'll never go wrong. Bellinis are also refreshing and their cocktail selection is awesome! Couple the food with the location and you've got the makings for an Ohio City staple. Love this place!"}
{"text":"So, I'm not from Cleveland and each time I'm there it baffles me how many restaurants are CLOSED ON SUNDAYS?!  What?!  WHY OH WHY?

Anyway, wanting to go out to a nice Sunday night dinner, Flying Fig popped up on Yelp as being open, and after having passed it several times during some strolls around Ohio City, I finally went in.  Great date spot!  It's cute and romantic with a diverse menu offering a little bit of everything.  Our waitress was SO cute and friendly, and you could tell she was passionate about the food at Flying Fig, a good sign!  It also happened to be restaurant week, and all the menu items I wanted were on there, so $35, why not?! 

I shared the tempura green beans and the marinated olives as appetizers, both were great and the tempura batter is to die for.  Not to mention the portion size is massive.  I also got the stuffed acorn squash as my entree, which is very unlike me since it's a vegetarian dish but IT WAS AMAZING.  Like actually...BOMB.  The cheesiest goodness, packed with veggies.  Awesome!  The salmon nicoise salad which I tried was also very good and the salmon was quality, you could tell the fish was fresh and not frozen.  A few glasses of wine later and the apple crumble for dessert, I left with a full stomach and a happy soul."}
{"text":"Inflated pricing for overly salty, subpar food that wishes it were gourmet. We visited the Fig in August, were a party of four, and were all disappointed by the food and overall experience. Service with a smug attitude from a guy who really wishes you weren't there in the restaurant sitting in his section expecting to have him take your order --- or worse answer a question or two. The guy was pushy, questioned my friends order (was he sure about his selection), and completely disregarded a request to bring my friends soup out with the main dishes. Tried it based on yelp reviews and boy do i regret it. What a waste of my b-day dinner with friends, what a waste of money. I hope people really consider the bad reviews on here. I do not recommend, do not waste your time or money. This place may have once been worth it, but no more. With so much selection next door to that very restaurant, the Fig owner would be wise to review their chefs and wait staff."}
{"text":"Truly as good as it gets in terms of food.  On both visits so far I've sat in the front at the bar - which does seem to have different decor and a cooler vibe than standard restaurant tables at the back - but the food was truly top notch starting with the bread which was really fantastic and clearly homemade.  I've tried a tomato salad, fresh sockeye salmon entrees (perfectly cooked, and great flavors), and a couple different desserts that were fresh and great.  I lived in Oregon for 4 years so I RARELY order salmon at a restaurant but this is one of the few places in the country that I have no hesitation because I know it will be fresh, and great.

I will definitely be back often when working in Cleveland, Flying Fig is easily one of the best restaurants in Cleveland and I am confident it can hold it's own against any place in the country."}
{"text":"walking into the flying fig I had recalled how dark and cavernous the space had looked in the summer, but how inviting and lush it looked in the winter. my date and I took a seat at the bar- unfortunately, the only two seats available were by apparently what was the servers' watering hole at the end of the bar and we overheard them multiple times making fun of some of their customers of the night. professional!!!

the way the space is arranged allows a cold, forceful draft to swiftly make its way from the front to the back of the restaurant. not sure what can be done about this, but the draft certainly took away from the cozy ambiance of the place. i had some delicious bar chips and ordered an OC Breeze which was nice and potent, the fried oysters, and striped bass with risotto.

The fried oysters were disappointing, because the traditional structure of the dish had a lot of room for improvement. They were served with grits, a green onion butter and lardons. The lardons were a great touch to enhance the savory flavor of the oysters, but the rest of the dish was absolutely unctuous and fatty. There was no essence of lightness, and besides the fried coating of the oysters, the only texture on the plate was slimy and fat. The butter had no other element to it, and the grits were finished with.. copious amounts of butter. This dish demanded some acid and brightness- the tabasco that was promised on the menu would have done the trick completely, but I did not detect it.

the striped bass itself was really perfectly cooked; it was a beautiful, substantial, fresh cut of fish. the risotto was delicious and I loved the striking Parmesan flavor, but once again, heavy, with no herb finish or anything of that nature that you would expect to see on a traditional risotto. the Meyer lemon and onion confit was what really did this dish in- you would think this would add an subtle sweetness that was yet acerbic, but however it was rendered made it very bitter and inedible. 

some elements of the dishes are brilliant, but in the restaurant's mission for rusticness, can be very heavy handed, and ultimately it loses its refinement in that. lots of potential."}
{"text":"Wasn't a huge fan of this place. Came here for brunch over the weekend and I wasn't very impressed. The menu to me wasn't very good... Maybe one thing on it caught my eye. I felt like it was trying a little hard to be unique and have creative dishes that none of them sounded very good. I decided to get the special which was a squash ricotta mixed greens filled omelette. I thought it was over priced for what you got. My omelette was $12 and it only came with a few potatoes. If I'm paying that much for an omelette I want it to be appealing to look and delicious and filling! The flavor was okay nothing I couldn't make...Other dishes were priced higher then that and it wasn't a ton of food you were getting. Definitely think this place is over priced for okay food."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite restaurants ever, and I say that as someone who eats meat but appreciates nothing more than a well-done vegetarian dish. In my opinion, this is where Flying Fig shines.

Any restaurant can do a nice steak or burger, but it takes a really great place to excel at vegetarian dishes. And every time I come here, I'm continuously amazed at the quality and freshness of their vegetarian entrees and their awesome house cocktails.

I would highly recommend starting with their cheese board and one of the many great wines they have. They switch their seasonal menus often, but I think just about anything you get here will be great, especially if it involves polenta or squash. Tofu is super hard to do well, but their tofu banh mi bowl was AMAZING."}
{"text":"The worst service! The hostess had such a bad attitude and was willing to let a party of 10 leave just because she didn't want us to push two tables close to each other.  She claimed this isn't what we traditionally do!  The manager needs to provide some training on sales and customer service.  Our experience continued to go downhill when we had to deal with a not so nice waitress that also shared the same bad attitude as the hostess.  I gave it a one star only because some of the food was good."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try Flying Fig's breakfast and I have no ragrets! (Not even an E). It's in a great area and I can see why it has good business. Walking in, I was impressed how big it was. Huge bar, bunch of tables and little rooms for more of an intimate feel. Given that it was brunch hour, I kind of wish we sat closer to a window with more lightening. I was placed in the more \"intimate\" room, which would have been perfect for dinner, but it was very dark and it didn't feel like only noon. Other then that, I can't complain. I had such a hard time picking what to order because everything looked so good! I ended up ordering the brie chicken sandwich and it was delicious!! The brie cheese was melted perfectly, the chicken was soft and easy to chew, bacon was crisp, and the avocado gave it that perfect touch. Our waiter was kind and was open to explaining a few of the choices that I contemplating, leading me to my pick. Definitely want to come here again soon to try out the other goods on the menu."}
{"text":"I've only been here for brunch. Quite good. I could tell the ingredients are of above average quality. The salad was quite good, and would think about getting it when I come here for dinner / lunch.

The sticky buns were good. Shared it before the main dishes came out, and satisfied my sugar cravings. Would recommend the Shaksuka with the sausage if you are into a savory breakfast. The chilaquiles were okay, but probably won't be it again (here at least). 

Overall, the ambiance is quite nice, and looks like a trendy place for date night. The mid-range prices were in line with the quality."}
{"text":"Not the coolest restaurant in town but an amazing happy hour and it's all night on Sunday's! We grabbed a few drinks here and tried the salmon belly lettuce wraps and chicken dumplings - would recommend both! We had great service and the bar definitely filled up for their specials. I'm not sure I'll be back for dinner but I'm interested to see what their brunch is like!"}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant 10 years ago and it took 5 years to get here once I moved to Ohio.  It has been outstanding each time I have had the pleasure of dining here. 
We met friends for brunch on Sunday. Soft eggs is a simple but delicious dish. The pulled pork Benedict was truly wonderful. 
The melon board seasoned with ancho was very tasty and beautifully presented. 
I have moved out of Ohio but flying fig is only 2 hours away!"}
{"text":"While I liked my meal well enough here, it's not a rave. I have to say for the price, what I would consider really fine dining, it is too much of a raucous bar atmosphere. I'm sure I must be in the minority, because the place was packed. Granted, my friend and I stumbled in one night without reservations and they accommodated us by seating us in a booth upfront by the bar, still it seemed like there wasn't much separation from the bar and all the other tables, so I don't know that it would make much of a difference. The food was okay, but I don't know if I'll go again factoring in the price and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"PERFECT spot for brunch! Such friendly staff members (we loved Olga!) and yummy food choices. See pictured is the Biscuits and Gravy with a mimosa. There's not always guaranteed spots, so make a reservation!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to get here for years, but they are never open when I'm around. This time the wife and I were shopping at WSM and left just in time to grab brunch.

Inside was small but comfortable. Service was prompt. Food was great. What more do you want? Well, one thing was lacking, and I will get to that, but as far as food goes, I had the biscuits and gravy while the wife had hotcakes made with andouille sausage and Ohio maple butter... both were awesome.

The lacking part was the beer list. I wasn't drinking at the time, but why a place like this doesn't have a list full of local beer I will never understand. I will come here to eat again, but hit some other bar for brew."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I were searching for a fun brunch place on Saturday morning.  This restaurant was just opening up for the day when we came strolling past and decided to give it a try.  The menu appeared to have a few unique opitions and the idea of locally sourced food caught our attention.  The restaurant filled up pretty quickly.  

I ordered the smoked turkey sandwich that consisted of bacon aioli, gruyere, house pickles, arugula, and caramelized onion focaccia.  I liked my sandwich and all the different flavors it included.  The pickles and the bread were my favorite components to the sandwich.  My friends were not quite as pleased as they had picked from the \"plates\" section of the menu (which included more of a breakfast fare).  Their portions were pretty small and nothing that they could really get excited about.  They all agreed the sandwich may have been the way to go, after seeing and trying out my sandwich.  

We had high hopes for this restaurant and left with only mediocre feelings about our brunch experience at Flying Fig."}
{"text":"This place is Ok.  You get some nice choices and good portions but of the many upscale nice restaurants in CLE this place is a step down.  

I ordered the tempura green beans and they were Ok but not amazing like some other reviews have said. Also the decor of the restaurant is pretty plain. It looks like it was designed in the 90's and never remodeled. 

With so many other choices near by I think this place is down the list."}
{"text":"The flying fig seemed promising from the reviews and upon our initial entrance into the restaurant with a nice quaint feel. The relatively limited menu seemed to be a good sign as well with the expectation that only the best items would be served. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Both the gnocchi and a fish special were incredibly salty as presented. The gnocchi was particularly salty where water with each bite was almost required. The flavoring was adequate if not for the over zealous use of salt. The fish (so unspectacular that I didn't remember what it was) had a salty herb coating that was almost crisp, but the fish itself was dry and overcooked. The white beans on the side of the fish were actually undercooked and not very tender. Overall this was a disappointing experience with the waiter seeming to be more interested in talking to other staff than being attentive. There are many better options down the road in Tremont for similar price."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great experience at Flying Fig back in 2012 and hoped to recreate those memories for his birthday this weekend. I made a reservation so I was a bit disappointed that we were seated at a table in a tight corner while other four seaters were available when we walked in on time. 

We were attended to quickly for drinks but our server forgot my soft drink. We asked for a few minutes to look over the menu. Once we placed our order, we waited for close to 40 minutes for our appetizer to arrive, with no one checking on us for water or drink refills in the interim. Our chicken dumplings arrived and were a bit overcooked and chewy. 

Our entrees arrived immediately after our appetizer plates were cleared so the timing felt a bits rushed after having waited so long for the appetizer. I ordered the burger which had great toppings and the fries were delicious though a bit soggy. When ordering I initially asked for mine to be cooked medium well and then changed it to medium, but it came out at least medium well and very dry. The bacon was delicious though! 

Finally, halfway through eating our entrees we realized the side of roasted carrots my husband ordered never arrived. We should have mentioned it but by that point did not want them and they didn't end up on the bill anyway. Overall, it was an okay meal but we felt a tad neglected!"}
{"text":"Oh flying fig, how I love thee! This is a consistently delicious, high quality and creative Ohio City spot. Servers are friendly and helpful, and the rotating specials are always worth a try."}
{"text":"On Saturday I had brunch here at the Flying Fig and I have to say it was fabulous.

I had planned to take my out of town guest to hit a regular fav restaurant in the area for lunch but my friend really wanted breakfast and saw the Fig's sign for brunch.  I had dinner here when they first opened and my memory from years ago was that it was overpriced and not so great but thank goodness for second chances. 

We sat inside since the tables outside were full as it was a gorgeous day.  It was tricky getting seated inside as they had  no one greeting guests and the staff at seemed indifferent.  Once seated we had great service even with someone new to the staff who was in training.  

The coffee was excellent and was provided with a lovely side service tray of including raw sugar, sweeter and creamer brought with my coffee.  Next came fresh bread with butter and homemade blueberry preserves.  A great start to what only got better,  my meal was sooo good!  I had the migas which was local eggs scrambled with tortillas, peppers, scallions, roasted chili, aged cheddar, tomatillo cilantro salsa and crème fraiche served with the most perfectly seasoned, roasted fingerling potatoes.  The layers of flavors was perfect and my taste buds savored every bite.  

My friend had the omelette of the day with which looked awesome and she proclaimed as the fluffiest, best omelette ever.  I personally rarely order an omelette because i really hate a \"browned\" omelet which I find overcooked and tough.  Next time I may get the omelette after seeing her breakfast.  

Oh wait, I forgot I planned to get the creamy polenta with tallegio cheese, local greens & Killbuck Farm mushrooms and a crispy poached egg.   But then it again it might be that I'd have the whole wheat Ohio blueberry & banana pancakes (choice of sausage or bacon) and Snake Hill Farms maple syrup.  Ah, so many great choices but it could be hard for me to pass up the migas again.

Here's my advice, make plans to go support the West Side Market merchants and get your week's groceries  -- and enjoy a great brunch supporting this local Ohio City restaurant.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere and service. All three courses were prepared perfectly and tasted great. Suzanne was an incredible server. She took her time with us and had all the knowledge we hoped for to make the best decisions on everything we ordered. Superb."}
{"text":"I went with a few friends for happy hour/dinner on a Friday night and although my pappardelle entree tasted pretty good, I know some of the other dishes were a disappointment, especially with consideration of price and our expectations given the reviews. The service was mediocre, bordering rude, for the waitress made us feel like unwanted customers for taking up her time - and all 6 of us had purchased large entrees, starters and drinks!  We were cordial and polite, so I'm sorry she was having a bad day... However, given this was my first time being there, I honestly regret recommending this place to meet up.  Parking was difficult, but I do enjoy coming to Ohio City for food and drinks."}
{"text":"One of what I'd consider to be one of the top four restaurants in the Cleveland area (Lola's, Three Birds, and the Ritz-Carlton), the Flying Fig has really elegant food at reasonable prices.  It's spendy, yes, but you get a very good meal for your cash, and all the foodies I've taken here have been impressed.  

If you're in the mood for small plates, you can order a bunch of starters at around $8-10 apiece, and they're well worth it.  The food's amazingly flavorful, and the service is food.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  
The dining experience at Flying Fig exceeded my expectations.
To start our table shared the Bruschetta, Dates, and Cold Plate.  The prosciutto was like butter, it was sensational and I've never been a fan.  The Dates were unexpectedly sweet, and the fresh basil on the bruschetta was perfect.
For dinner I had the duck and it was perfect, not greasy at all and very tender.  The grits and chard accompaniments were perfect. Karen did not miss a beat!
A friend had the pork trio and loved the pork stomach.  Another friend had the Haddock and let us all try a bite.  It was so soft and buttery - SMILE.
For dessert we ordered two chocolate molten cakes - yum, the apple crostini - tart, and my favorite - the berry cobbler, I think they were picked off the bush that morning and the fig ice cream on the side was heaven.
I loved Flying Fig and can't wait to come back again.
One star missing?- the bartender was a little snooty, I hope it was just one of those days and not her true personality."}
{"text":"A MUST STOP IN CLEVELAND!  This is my first time at The Flying Fig and I will come again next visit to Cleveland.  I stopped in for a drink and brunch.  I had tbe Corn Andouille Pancakes with poached egg and potatoes.  Best breakfast plate I've had in a long time.  They also have their own homemade hot sauces (red and green) that add a nice to to the plate if you want.  Great cocktails and service as well.  Great Lakes Brewery across the street and small parking lot near by.  I came on a Saturday at noon and it was a full place with a minor wait.  Look forward to checking it out again at different times of the day.  A must stop!"}
{"text":"Food too salty!!
I had a Croque Madame that was disappointing . Don't want to risk dinner there :-("}
{"text":"Creative little restaurant with impeccable service. We wandered in one Thursday evening before a show at Playhouse Square. The menu wasn't descriptive enough for me to understand what the dishes actually were, but our server made some great suggestions. We shared an appetizer of the fried green beans, then split a dinner of chicken over a sautee of vegetables. Obviously those weren't the menu names, but that's what was on the plate! The wine list was full of labels I've never heard of before but our server recommended a great Spanish red which I loved. My mom also had a fall seasonal vegetable soup but she said was full of flavor. I'd love to return for brunch."}
{"text":"The Flying Fig offers mostly traditional fare but seemingly tries to push the envelop by adding an extra element or seasoning to most dishes and obviously the chef and her staff are topnotch because they make it work.

The same goes for the bartenders as their signature cocktails all have like five or six ingredients. I have to admit I couldn't identify each ingredient with the drinks we had but they worked well together. One heads-up, if you order an Old-Fashioned there, like Jeannene did, you better have your big boy pants on because the rye whiskey is front and center. (The bartender referred to it as a Pre-Prohibition drink in which the alcohol was the star compared to immediately post Prohibition in which poor quality liquor led to more oranges and cherries being added to mask the taste.) 

As an appetizer we had the artisanal cheeseboard ($14), which was quite respectable with four different cheeses -- a blue cheese, a creamy goat cheese dripping with honey, and two other firm white cheeses that I missed the names of but each offered a slightly funky taste. We usually praise meat and cheese plates based on the additional items and this one would rank high thanks to a fantastic apple butter which paired well with every cheese.

For main courses, I went with the Tagliatelle Bolognese ($22) and I found the pasta perfectly made and the dollop of minted ricotta to be a nice touch though I found the beef/pork ragout to be lacking in savoriness though Jeannene disagreed. She had the Stuffed Acorn Squash ($26) and raved about it and I enjoyed the scoop of very creamy farro and mushroom risotto she let me try.

This place continues to be a shining star in an increasingly competitive W. 25th St. area."}
{"text":"The tempura green beans might just be the most delicious things I've ever had. I'd come back to Flying Fig just for those!"}
{"text":"It's places like this that really, really make a city liveable. Having innovative, delicious restaurants in areas contribute to the health and vitality of a neighborhood and this one surely must lead the pack. It doesn't hurt that it's a farm-to-table restaurant either. 

Went in to a beautiful restaurant, dark and gorgeous and really fascinating art hanging everywhere. I was captivated.

Greeted by this really strange girl (sorry, it's the only descriptor I can think of). She seemed almost repulsed by me. It's probably the worst greeting I've ever gotten by someone in a restaurant. Anyway, sat down in the bar area in a nice booth and checked out the delicious menu. 

Yelp says it's vegetarian, but it doesn't identify that way. I'm glad Yelp did, though, because that's what drew me in. By the way, the menu DOES have vegetarian items that are worth checking out, and enough of them to keep me and every other vegetarian really happy. 

I decided on the tempura battered green beans with a pineapple caramel dipping sauce (they also had a ponzu sauce that didn't like; it was too much salt for me). I also chose the warm 'egg salad.' That's how they have it on the menu. It was called a gruyere-chive soft scramble on an olive oil toasted multi-grain bread and served with a side salad.

This was a lot of food for one person. It may have been really suitable for two. I did not care. I ate it all and I loved it. 

The green beans were crispy and just-the-right-salty. The sweetness of the dipping sauce really gave this dish a beautiful balance that just really engaged my taste buds. Mmmm, mmmm good. 

But, the best, very best part of this meal were eggs. You don't have to listen to anything I say, but this: you will never, ever, as long as you live, ever taste eggs like this. I can't even describe them except to say that you have to try them. Words could never do them justice.

The side salad was one of the best I've ever had as well. If all salads tasted like this I'd probably eat a lot more of them. They have these down to an art.

Now to service: the first girl was horrendous, but then had a really great dark haired guy that was awesome and a blonde waiter that was okay. I had to ask for stuff, he seemed a little oblivious, but it was okay. 

I went to the bar to ask for a refill on my drink and encountered weird girl again. She really needs to work on her customer service. When I asked if she minded getting me a refill she just stared at me. I said 'is that yes' and she almost jumped out of her skin telling me yes. Okay, okay, calm down, geez. Disliked her immensely. Everyone else was fine.

The food is the shining star here. It is divine."}
{"text":"It's unpretentious, it's chic, it's very tasty.

If I lived in Cleveland, the Flying Fig would easily be my favorite restaurant.  I love dining out in smaller cities because you can eat at excellent restaurants for excellent prices!  I read about this place on the plane ride over in the Continental magazine and immediately put it on my list of places-to-dine.

Service was the best I've had: our waitress was friendly (but not to the point of loquaciousness) and helpful (but not to the point of being overbearing).  She made sure to recommend the perfect wine to go along with fish and duck.  There's both outdoor and indoor dining.

I fell in love with the herbed ricotta gnocchi...  The pasta was firm but not too chewy, and was accented very well by fresh herbs and cheeses.  Unfortunately, the duck entree was a little dry, and a tad past my requested medium doneness.  The pain perdu dessert (brioche french toast w/ apples and ginger ice cream) was refreshing and a nice ending to a heavy meal.

If I come here again, I'm almost positive this rating would change from 4.5 to five stars."}
{"text":"Best brunch in town!! Cheddar biscuits are incredible. Steak and eggs special was divine. Yuevos rancheros were authentic tasting and rich in flavors. The braised short rib breakfast comes in a delicious brown gravy and it's served with buttered focaccia bread! Man it was good, we were almost in shock of how good everything was."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today with my beau and Dad for a Christmas lunch.  We were able to walk right in and be seated with no problems and no resos.  Our waitress was very patient with us as we chatted and she returned time and again to take our order.  The coffee was kept filled, as was the water.  

Our orders came up quick (once we finally placed them).  The bread with Apple Butter on the table was a nice touch.  The apple butter was yummy!  My Dad & I both got the Migas.  He really enjoyed it; I didn't think it was bad, but not as exciting as it could have been.  My beau got the Croque Madame, and oh. my. Lord.  was that AH-mazing!  Next time, I'm getting that and splitting it.  The beau was VERY happy & stuffed.  He enjoyed a belini and I had a so-so bloody Mary. 

The service was spot-on, the food was good, and yes, I will return.  There were very nice vegetarian options as well as those for the meat-lovers.  I think you'll enjoy Flying Fig."}
{"text":"The Fig is OK. If you hit one of the specials you will love it.  The rest of the menu is just OK.  The best thing to do is sit at the bar, have a drink and a small plate.  The people are great and you meet interesting people at the bar.  I wish somebody would just make a great steak, steamed veg and baked potato in Ohio City.  Am I asking for to much."}
{"text":"The food it self is really good. Everything is great actually. But, that one bartender who is snarky and wears little hats and treats you like shit . Well he's not worth my time. I would rather eat a bag of snails then look at him while I enjoy my meal. FIRE HIM. TAKE HIS JOB AWAY. The staff is a bunch of sniffed up bozos."}
{"text":"I am here, right now, and we are the only two here. 

Clevelanders, you suck. 

Great cocktails 

The bacon wrapped dates are amazing 

The calamari is fantastic 

Tha bartenders actually know their shit

And yet we sit alone 

I mean thank you for leaving us in peace but fuck all of you for not coming here and keeping this place open."}
{"text":"What do you do when you wake up on a mid-December Saturday morning, step out in street, and are greeted with a tropical 60 degree breeze? You carpe diem and make plans to enjoy the day! I had been to the Flying Fig a few months back for drinks, so I was eager to explore the brunch menu. I'm happy to report, I came away impressed with my experience!

We ordered the Broiled Grapefruit Brulee, Huevos Rancheros and Quiche. All three dishes were amazing in their own way. The brulee coating, helped intensify the natural sweetness of the grapefruit. The Heuvos Rancheros was a beautiful combination of braised peppers, tomatoes, feta, topped with a fried egg. 

I've been told that real men don't each quiche. We'll if it's wrong, I don't want to be right. The quiche was light and creamy. It came with a mixed green salad and ceaser dressing.

Our waiter was prompt and very courteous. I'm happy to report that I came away very impressed with the Flying Fig. Great atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"One of my fav restaurants in Cleveland.  Excellent selection of menu, very contemporary and chic.

I have had the seafood items and also the cheese plate and both were excellent.  The dessert is very good, I had the creme fruit cake...phenom.

The service is pretty decent and a good place to enjoy a nice meal."}
{"text":"After all the rave reviews, I have to agree... Flying Fig is really good.  4.5 for me.

We tried Eileen's bacon wrapped dates, Calamari Fritti, Antipasti sampler, Hanger Steak rare, and the braised ribs.  I tried a Sidecar which was appropriately prepared. 

Everything was very flavourful ... although the hanger steak didn't really appeal to me.  The tenderness of the ribs were much more to my liking.  

Decor is appealing also, with olive, and burgundy and a kind of squash colour.  Music is lounge-y and relatively unobtrusive.  

The Flying Fig is definitely worth a trip out... even though the parking isn't so very obvious..."}
{"text":"This review isn't based on the food, since we didn't end up eating there. We made reservations for Flying Fig on New Years Eve. We arrive and are told we must order from the $80 per person tasting menu. I really wasn't upset about the price, but I was upset about the fact that we were not told this when we called to make the reservation. I also was not thrilled about the hostess looking us up and down and saying \" you know it's $80 per person, right?\". Honestly the menu looked good and we probably would have given the mandatory menu a shot, had we been forewarned, but it really wasn't what we were looking for. 
Maybe we should have assumed there would be a mandatory menu we would have to order from? I don't know. I just didn't want a four course meal. All we really wanted was to share a few small plates before we started celebrating. I'm just disappointed we were never told (we checked out the website beforehand and we called to make the reservation). If we would have known prior, we could have had time to make arrangements elsewhere.
In the end, we were luckily able to find a table elsewhere, and shared a few apps and had some cocktails, which is exactly what we wanted. I'll probably try Flying Fig again, but I don't have a great memory based on the way we were treated this time."}
{"text":"After hearing about Flying Fig forever (magazine write-ups, friends), I came here with a few girlfriends to share the small plates. I can't believe its taken me several years to make my way here!

It really is one of Cleveland's best. Some of my favorites: house-made pasta (soft, fresh, delicious), medjool dates (chorizo, dates in bacon), and the fig ice cream (creamy, delicious - only needed a few bites!) Mmm.. drooling...right now.

Others that were still good: tempura battered green beans, mussels (mmm), roasted beet salad.

The overall environment was enjoyable and I had a great time with the girls!"}
{"text":"My first time at Flying Fig was definitely better than the second time. However, I still have hope for Flying Fig, so I'll be willing to give it a Four Star. To make my life easier, below are the reasons why it deserves a four star and reasons why it was disappointing at times:

Why I gave it a 4 star:
1) Great appetizer - try the dates, it was delicious!
2) Classy place to go for a date
3) Happy Hour food was decent with some fun drinks (chicken drumstick was good, bruschetta was interesting)
4) The majority of their dinner selections were pretty tasty - the duck was good.

Now, why I shouldn't have given it a 4 star:
1) We got a random gratuity charge when we went for happy hour - there was only 2 of us eating too.
2) I did not like their short ribs. The lamb meat wasn't as tender as it could have been. Overall, my second time dinning there was a bit disappointing - the price I paid wasn't worth the quality I received.

It's okay, overall, this is a nice place to go. I'd give it one more try sometime to let the restaurant redeem itself."}
{"text":"No valet and no parking lot. Very small restaurant with average cuisine. Liquor selection is marginal at best but the pricing isn't ridiculous so that's a plus. If you have any dietary restrictions don't come here as they refuse to \"alter the menu\" whatsoever. I simply asked for a bun to not be included and they refused. So I didn't eat and grabbed something on the way home from dinner. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I took my brother here for brunch on Labor Day weekend. We ate at the bar because we didn't have reservations but that was okay! It was a busy weekend for the area restaurants. I had huevos rancheros which can go terribly wrong but everything was right about it. Tasty black bean purée, sandwiched between good quality crisped tortillas, perfectly done fried eggs and a delicious chili sauce. My brother had the Thai salad made with Ohio City ramen noodles, very fresh veggies and a tasty dressing. I did not find the prices out of line for a small, chef run restaurant."}
{"text":"Made reservations for this place.

Location is right in Ohio City.  Parking can be a bit of a hassle, paid as well as free street parking around the area.

Coffee: one cup of regular joe is $3.25!!! 

Sticky bun: it was delicious.

Cinnamon apple pancakes: it came with three sausages. The sausages were good (according to me) and not good (according to my girlfriend).  

OVERALL IMPRESSION:
The food was ok and our waitress was nice, but I felt a bit miffed that the coffee was so expensive.  I probably will not go back unless another friend were to pick this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good, the bar area was especially nice and the bartenders very good and friendly.  The chips with their horseradish dipping sauce were especially good, although they do not quite go with a Manhattan.
My food was good but not great.  Actually, the short ribs were great, but the scallops were just okay: over buttered and cooked a little too long.  
I don't know if this is really the \"Zuni of Cleveland\", but it is true that Cleveland does not have many Zuni-like places."}
{"text":"What a great place! Casual, comfortable feel with upscale food. Locally sourced, in season. Do your self a favor and try the biscuits and gravy. Oh goodness the gravy!"}
{"text":"Holy wow. The Flying Fig was amazing. My sister and I went here for brunch after staying the night in Cleveland. I wanted to go solely based on the fact that they had a Croque Madame on their menu, and boy I was not let down. 

The place was kind of small and a bit tight fitting, but we got a table right away, no waiting - on a Saturday! Granted it was a cold and dreary day so I'm thinking that's not the norm. Our table was small but cozy. We both ordered tea to fight off the dampness, I got a ginger tea and my sister got a black tea. They also start you off with fresh bread and butter and apple butter or something. Man it was fantastic. 

So I got my Croque Madame, my sister got the biscuits and gravy. Oh man, that Croque Madame did not let me down! If you are going there, get it. It was absolutely freaking delicious. I would have devoured it all, but it was also fairly large and a ton of bread and right and delicious. It also came with a small salad, I'm assuming to cut through the fatty-ness of the sandwich itself. But seriously, one of the best things I have ever eat. Ever. The biscuits and gravy were good, but the Croque Madame stole the show for that brunch. 

If you are in the area, definitely go. I'm already planning a trip back to Cleveland just so I can go back."}
{"text":"Very good, consistent quality for lunch and dinner. Will definitely return with friends!!"}
{"text":"The Flying Fig is right next to a brewery so you'll smell some of that hot brew. It is a great place to get brunch and they have some specials. Since it was pretty cold the day I went, they had a special for chili and chips. I hopped on that as my first decision and my buddies got sliders and the steak and eggs. Although the chili was good, the portion was small and I mooched off my friend with the steak and eggs. What he got was delicious. It is a simple meal, but prepared very well nonetheless."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because my boyfriend bought the Travelzoo deal ($22 for two entrees and 1 appetizer). The food was pretty good, but I was hugely disappointed by the portion size. 

For starters, we ordered the Medjool Dates. It came with 3 Jolly Rancher-sized dates wrapped in bacon for the price of $8. The taste was great and all, but I am never going to pay $8 for that little amount of food again. To be fair though, the waitress did warn us about the size. For entrees, we both ordered the Grilled Flank Steak. I had the hardest time picking what to get because nothing on the menu seemed very appetizing :( The steak was very delicious, but like the appetizer, the portion size was small. My boyfriend and I ended up eating a second lunch after this. 

Overall, the service and food were great, but the portion size was just too disappointing for me to rate this restaurant anything higher than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Just a wonderful, friendly place for a fantastic dining experience.  I love good food, and though my wife is more of a foodie than I am, the Flying Fig really delivers the goods on elegant food.  

Marie and I celebrated our anniversary here and had a wonderful experience thanks to the friendly and attentive staff.  I only get to Cleveland every couple of years, but I'll be looking forward to another great meal at the Flying Fig in 2010."}
{"text":"Long overdue to eat here! At the Westside Market, we wanted a quick lunch and, being the day after the 4th, the market was jammed and waiting lines were long for about everything inside and nearby. Still close, and across from the Great Lakes Brewery \"megaplex\", sits \"Flying Fig\". Featuring locally sourced produce and meats, their menu was varied and creative. My friend had the beet salad, which she pronounced \"very tasty\", and I had a nice glass of Chardonnay and their burger, with cheese, bacon, and terrific fries. Yes, I know that   you may think that a burger may not be your best bet to judge a restaurant, but I beg to differ. Granted, they have more elaborate salad and sandwich offerings, but give me a good ole burger, and the quality of a restaurants shines.  In fact, I'm now inspired to do a list of Cleveland area's \"best burgers\":
Fire, Cowell and Hubbard, Flying Fig, Thyme2, and Moxie,....you're on deck!! Suggestions??"}
{"text":"I honestly can't believe I've never been here until last night.  It is right across from the Great Lakes Brewery in Ohio City and I've walked past this charming little spot quite a few times.  My cousin and I went here the other night.  Easily found street parking and we were on our way!

We started with the cheese plate and we shared the trout dish.  Both were quite good.  Washed that all down with a couple martinis each.  I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance.  Only complaint: the temperature.  It was just so warm and muggy in the restaurant.  I mean, it was kind of a strange day: warm but windy and spring is just starting to hit.  Maybe they were still set to winter on their heating/cooling unit.  

Either way, great dinner."}
{"text":"Very interesting place. Our second visit here, and both times have been good. We had a burger, frittata, peach bacon sandwich, and chicken thigh sandwich. Everything was well prepared, fresh and tasty. And close to the west side market and Penzeys!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the appearance...it's a cute little restaurant with a pretty nice little bar. One thing I noticed right away was the piece on the wall that was made of light bulbs by the front window and one was missing. It kinda stuck out and I wondered why they didn't replace the light bulb. Just a small thing but then I started looking around and noticed that there were quite a bit of lights out. Also, my table was being held in place with one of the server booklets to make sure it was balanced which I thought looked tacky but I guess better than having a table that rocks. It seems like management could easily fix these things with very little effort and make the place look a lot better. Now to the food. My girlfriend and I started with the beef carpaccio which our server recommended. It was EXCELLENT. The beef was very flavorful and had a lemon vinaigrette and fried capers that were outstanding - very well balanced and flavorful. The second dish we ordered was the goat cheese salad. It was a standard leafy salad with a crunchy piece of bread that had a lump of goat cheese on it. It was very average at best and just kinda lacked any real excitement. I guess that's kind of expected for a salad but then I guess it shouldn't be $12 and I wouldn't expect so much from it. The final course we ordered was the gnocchi. It was a homemade gnocchi with good density and was tossed with brussel sprouts. It was nothing to write home about and was overall pretty average I thought. The service in the restaurant was really great - our server was very attentive, recommended dishes when asked, very friendly, filled my glass when it was needed and I would rate her 5 stars. But, the food? I thought it was pretty average and pretty expensive to be just average..."}
{"text":"While not a traditional Steak House, I enjoyed one of the best Rib Eye steaks I have ever had here.  Matched with a perfect wine reduction.  Just excellent.  My guest had two beautiful pieces of  Walleye, and both meals were accompanied with local, seasonal vegetables.  
Great location in Ohio City, with easy and affordable parking.  Room is cozy and the cocktails are great.  Try the Manhattan if you enjoy Bourbon"}
{"text":"We have had dinner here several times and each time it is amazing! The food, service, and cocktails are consistently great. I have been to alot of great restaurants (some with michelin star chefs) and in my opinion the Fig is among the best of the best. I have never had a bad dish or experience here. The staff is very attentive and well coordinated. But enough about all of that, the most impressive part about the Fig is THE FOOD! Every dish is so good that when our dinner was over I was envious of guests arriving to start their meal. Just thinking back on our last meal at the Fig is making me hungry."}
{"text":"I had one of the best pasta bolognese dishes I've ever had in my life here! Also had an amazing cheese tray. The outside area is super nice and relaxing. Great dining experience."}
{"text":"Great comfortable and relaxed atmosphere, creative dishes and outstanding beverage pairing by bartender."}
{"text":"I try not to tar an establishment's culinary offerings with service issues unless it's systemic, so the stars here are all about the food.  In our case, we had a waiter who loved the sound of his voice and felt the need to pontificate on every selection.  After suggesting a wine for my one of our party who readily agreed to it, he announced that he couldn't in good faith bring it to her unless she listened to his description only then could she agree.  The description was of course filled with wine speak (\"it has floral notes with a touch of leather\", yada, yada).  It went on like this for the duration to the point where we avoided dessert to save ourselves the speeches.
In the pet peeve department--I'm annoyed by \"no substitutions\" rules.  I ordered a dish that had some coconut-based side.  I was told I couldn't ask for anything else and was basically instructed to just throw it away when it shows up.  Shouldn't a chef display his/her culinary skills by offering something else?  Or does he/she feel that there is no possible other combination that would do justice to the masterpiece being offered to a mere consumer.

Food wise is was a mixed bag, but generally OK.  The dumplings were light but a bit on the sweet side.  The empanada was crispy and spicy--best appetizer of the bunch.  The mussels (a special that evening) were immersed in a tomato base and over-seasoned with paprika that took away from the overall taste.  The focaccia bread was fine as was the simple salad.  My short ribs were tasty and filling.  That's the dish that featured a coconut-based cake/bread.

Fortunately the prices were reasonable so you didn't come feeling you were being gouged.  Not sure I'd return as the menu wasn't all that interesting."}
{"text":"Just had brunch with my girlfriends. We each ordered something different and sampled each other's meals. I ordered the whole wheat blueberry pancakes and I was in LOVE.  I did end up ordering a side of eggs because I wanted MORE FOOD! Everything was delicious, but if you're a big eater, you may want to order more sides.  I hope that doesn't make me sound too piggy!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and a great!  Happy hour.  I hate going downtown so location is always a minus for me."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service for dinner. The breakfast was not as good."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and it was great! First of all, the apple butter that comes with the free bread is awesome. For my meal, I got the chicken meatballs- for me, it was the perfect portion size, and it was really tasty! Also, it was a dish that won't make me hate myself since its relatively healthy with he protein from the chicken, a little bit of mashed potatoes, and some nice rapini. The prices were also very reasonable. I'd definitely return again since I want to try all of the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and very pleasant and classy atmosphere. Love the little shop on the side too!  Definite perk to use the CLEseats app!"}
{"text":"I have been in here several times for the happy hour special and drinks in the bar with friends.They have some nice and what seems to be reasonably priced items on the happy hour menu. The food has been generally well prepared. 

I downgrade them because 3 out of 4 times the tab has come and it has been wrong. Grossly overcharged. At my last visit I had a $7 food item and five beers and the tab was $66 before tip. Not! 

People seem to LOVE this place. I think there may be better options round in 2014.  Living on past success in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! It was fairly small, slightly darkened and romantic. The service was friendly and attentive but not in-your-face. I got the vegetarian bread pudding and my husband tried the chicken. We loved, loved our food. We didn't get anything else because we were heading out to the Market Avenue Wine Bar next door for drinks and stuff, but I would definitely come back here. Great for dates!"}
{"text":"Just had drinks and salads here last night (I'll come back to those) but I just have to comment on the service first. It was fantastic and just made it such a pleasure to be there. The hostess was friendly and accommodating. Our server was just SO nice, personable and gave off such a welcoming, happy-to-have-you-here vibe. It was great. 

We had two salads - the simple greens and the beet salad. Simple greens was ok. The beet salad was the absolute star. Pickled beets, arugula, whipped cloverton, a honey vinaigrette, and crumbled crouton. I loved having the crouton crumbled like that - it gave a little crunch to every bite. 

Their other food is great, too. On this occasion we just kept it light."}
{"text":"I've visited a few times. Menu is limited and the chef is not accomodating. But the few things I did order were delicious. Service is hit or miss. Loud atmosphere every time I visited."}
{"text":"Easily said, one of my favorite places to have dinner in Cle.

I usually start with a \"small start\". The Medjool Dates are to die for and I get them almost every time. The flatbread is also delicious! My favorite salad to order for the table would have to bee the Local Beet salad. It's delicious and is enough to split up before the meal arrives.

Now to the main dishes. My absolute favorite has been the Roasted Local Winter Squash. The squash is topped with quinoa, apple, mushrooms, leeks, herbs, feta, greens and toasted walnuts. It is soooo delicious. My second pick has been the Herbed Ricotta Gnocchi. Also available in a 1/2 portion.

Ifyou stop at the bar for drinks and a light bite or go for dinner....you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was my first time dining a Flying Fig.  A co-worker and I journeyed there for lunch.  I love the fact that the restaurant is tucked away on Market Street away from the hustle and bustle of W25th.   We ordered the calamari and rock shrimp appetizer to share.   This appetizer was SOOOO good, one of the best preparations of calamari that I've ever had.  The calamari was so tender, lightly breaded, mixed with pickled vegetables and served on a bed of arugula with a side of aioli.  The portion was very generous, more than enough for 2 people to share as an appetizer.  I could have also had this as an entree with a small salad or vegetable side.   On to the entree, I ordered the warm roasted chicken sandwich which was artfully prepared with sliced apples and brie on a warm toasty ciabatta bun with a side of homemade chips.  My co-worker ordered the burger, which arrived with a side of handcut fries, which she mentioned was very, very good.   I am very much looking forward to going back to Flying Fig for dinner and brunch.  This meal was a homerun!!"}
{"text":"Loved the food, did not love the service.  The timing was way off.  The waiter didn't come to our table for about 5-10 min after we were seated to take our drink order.  We received our appetizers just about on time.  However, it was at least another 20-30 minutes after finishing our appetizers before our main course arrived.  Will we be returning?  Maybe.  I would prefer Pier W or Greenhouse Tavern over Flying Fig."}
{"text":"I was fairly disappointed with our meals. Over priced for meals that can use some perfecting. 

I ordered an omelette and the eggs were a little overcooked, resulting in a overly chewy dry texture. Also, the peppers were cooked well but bitter. Nothing in the omelette was very complementary to the bitterness of the peppers. 

My husband ordered biscuits and gravy and that was a sad dish. The proportions were tiny for $13. You can easily get this meal for less than $6. The biscuits were really small so they don't have the soft flakey texture of larger biscuits. 

On top of that, our cups of coffee were $3.25. 

However, my friend ordered the chicken biscuit sandwich and that was delicious. No complaints about that dish."}
{"text":"Infatuated with Flying Fig! I adore the ambiance of the space itself and the intimate feel it offers. I have been there for dinner with my fiance and then on another occasion with a couple girlfriends, and it was perfect for both. It doesn't get loud in there, so it is easy to chat and have a fluid conversation while enjoying delicious food. Their calamari is so light and tasty, the sauce they serve with it is lemony goodness and doesn't give you that heavy, full of fried dough feel that some calamari tends to do. It might be the best prepared calamari I have ever had!!

For my entree, I ordered the polenta. SPOT ON. The combination of the polenta, ratatouille and fried egg sounded like an odd trio to me, but I trusted that FF knew what they were doing and man am I glad I did! Everything is so fresh and flavorful and allows  you to leave feeling guilt free. All the staff if super friendly and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"How do you describe this place...PERFECT! Omgosh! I love the servers/bartenders (Kevins knowledge of cocktails and wine is awesome and Denises bubbly and fun personality makes your experience!) Not to mention the food is UNbelievable!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the Sunday night happy hour.
I thought it was good.
Not great.
Not 4 or 5 stars by any means, IMO

We had tempura green beans, bleu cheese burgers, french fries and pork nachos.

Average.  Painfully average, as I went in here with very high expectations.

Poo."}
{"text":"TL;DR; Good food, GREAT service. 

Rolled in around 1700 to meet up with an old friend,  and someone is taking their high school pictures out front. Most of the surrounding businesses were packed, with people who have loved the Indians their whole life, but still have tags on their new Indians gear. I wasn't expecting a great experience. . . 

Ryan was the bartender (and server), and he did great work. Drink refills were prompt, and he had the right amount of small talk. He didn't annoy us or squeeze in, but he wasn't shy or ignoring us. 

They only had two things that fit my dietary wants, and the first thing I ordered was just plain terrible (Warm Montequilla Olives). Absolutely disgusting. It was a few very over crispy bread pieces, some pit filled olives, and vegetables that were just soaked with pepper juice. Awful. I ate what I could, but ended up ordering their other option. The Tempura Green Beans and Ponzu sauce were great. Ryan took the first thing off.

My companion went with Lettuce Wrapped Salmon Something's. She didn't seem impressed, but between the drinks, and maybe too much (added) hot sauce, I would take that with a grain of salt. It looked great!

At the end of the night, we actually came back and sat down to get some water and chat for a bit longer before heading out. Ryan was just as pleasant, and kept us hydrated. Great experience, and no hipster nonsense."}
{"text":"We started with drinks and apps tonight.. Never made it to dinner because of such terrible service. We arrived right before the kitchen opened and there were maybe 3 tables at most. We were not acknowledged for nearly 20 minutes even though the other server was helping people right next to us (visiting her table multiple times). Seriously?? Even if we are not in your section, you can greet us, no?? Our empty plates were sitting on the table long after we were finished... A server and (maybe) the manager hung around outside near our table... Again, no acknowledgement of the dirty plates. So disappointing. See you again never."}
{"text":"If I could afford it I would eat (and drink) here every night.

Every meal and beverage I've had here has been something more than I expected - and my expectations were high. Every dish has 3 or 4 layers of flavor that build and allow the diner to relish the ingredients and the creativity that was used to combine them. The drinks are well crafted and arrive bracingly cold - perfect. And do not miss their desserts - they seem to perfectly conclude the dining experience - like closing the cover to a fantastic book.

I've been 3 times in 12 months ... and am saving up for my next visit :-)"}
{"text":"Just had a great brunch here.  I had the burger & my wife had the pancakes. Everything was delicious (I tasted hers of course).  The bread & jam they bring beforehand was great too.  Would definitely come back & recommend this restaurant to all.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"5 stars all the way !  Came from California and had to stop here after Michael Simons recommendation. Not here for dinner , but for happy hour. Nachos and burger were wicked !  The custom drinks were tasty."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I wrote an email to the owners of the Flying Fig on December 1, 2013, and have yet to receive a response. It has been two whole months since then -- callous and unacceptable. The owners obviously do not care.

This was my message:
\"Had brunch at the Fig on Sunday. Ordered a Bloody Mary and an orange cocktail (acceptable). Also ordered Biscuits & Gravy (good) and Migas (okay). But what killed our experience was the HORRENDOUS service.  

Our server, Josh, was distracted and did not check on us.  When he did come he did not demonstrate knowledge of the menu.  I asked which he would recommend, between the omelette and Migas.  He ummed, ahhed, and failed to provide a coherent response. When the food came he did not see if the items were to our liking. When we asked for the check he delivered it and then failed to come back for our credit card in a timely manner. He walked by our table several times before I flagged him down in desperation. Instead of apologizing he feigned surprise. Terrible.

Suffice it to say the service we experienced at your restaurant left much to be desired. I hope that you will take these comments under advisement.\""}
{"text":"This place has been hit or miss for me in the past.  Sometimes it was great, sometimes it was a little off.  I guess it depended on who was in the kitchen that day.  Recently, my visits have been great!  Whatever caused the inconsistency problems for me are all gone.  I'll be back much more often."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a foodigasm.

This is definitely my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. The food is elegant yet not overdressed. The staff is knowledgable but not condescending. The atmosphere is romantic but still fun. 
The chef definitely takes pride in her craft and respects the ingredients that she uses. The menu is very seasonal making sure only ingredients that are in season and of good quality are used. The only recommendation I can make due to this is try the duck (however it is prepared it is decadent), the molten chocolate cake with fig ice cream (yumm), and the martini specials at the bar (a different celebration of flavors everynight)"}
{"text":"This is the best burger in Cleveland or all of Ohio as far as I am concerned. Has all the richness that grass-fed beef should and I love the mustard they put on it. At $22 the Miler Burger might seem a bit pricey, but if you come at happy hour it is under $10. Flying Fig has some other great flat-breads and their fries are very good too. I put this as one of the best places for happy hour in Cleveland and then you can move on to other places around W 25th street."}
{"text":"4 stars only for the limited menu.  Phenomenal service though, (I believe Annie was her name at the bar).  We got there at happy hour and each got a market sandwich and draft beer for 10 bucks.  Hell of a deal considering those sandwiches are normally 11-12 bucks on their own.

Just a really chill vibe and a staple in Ohio City."}
{"text":"Diabolical hot cakes

Amazing service

Dynamite location

Great specials

Never a bad meal

Will be going back soon"}
{"text":"I went to Flying Fig twice this weekend.  Once for happy hour/dinner on Friday, and again on Sunday for brunch.  The restaurant itself is very warm and inviting.  Both visits we had a seat near the bar and found the booths to be very comfortable and good for people watching.  Friday night we had a happy hour hamburger which is delicious and a steal at $5.  We also got the two-cheese sandwich.  This was simply one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  It consisted of very good quality, slightly aged cheese with walnuts, pickled zucchini, figs, and arugula on excellent focaccia. Simply delicious. The cocktails we got were excellent also, including a gin gimlet and a house concoction of St. Germain, gin, citrus, and soda.  

Sunday brunch was more of the same.  We tried the huevos rancheros and the polenta with deep fried egg and mushrooms.  Both were excellent.  The price is a bit steep for brunch, but the quality more than justifies it.  We had the same waiter both trips, and the service was excellent and affably understated."}
{"text":"Flying Fig is located across West 25th street from Cleveland's legendary West Side Market. It is nestled in a brick road, lined by tall shade trees, amidst a row of cafes and the Great Lakes Brewing Company; at the epicenter of the hip Ohio City neighborhood. This is a small restaurant in a charming location. In the summer months, I would opt for patio seating to soak in this lovely ambience. This is THE way to hang out and spend a weekend: to soak in the outdoor seating, architecture, people, and to be one with the city.

We were here for lunch. The local beet salad I had was a magical mix of flavors. The sweetness of the pickled beets, with the bitter arugula, the perfectly cooked 6-minute egg, and the salty croutons danced all over my taste buds. All of this was on a base of whipped cloverton. Cloverton is made from cow's milk but has the flavor profile of goat cheese with perhaps a quarter of its intensity. This was a refreshing surprise on that dish.

All-in-all, I'm a fan and I would definitely come back. This might be an excellent place to take out-of-town guests for brunch which I am looking forward to sampling, perhaps to be followed by a visit to the West Side Market and the brewery later in the day. I was definitely impressed."}
{"text":"Bummer!  I tried the Mahi Mahi, what a waste of money and time. Salty, tangy, small, incredibly spicy (spicy was not advertised).  The Mahi was served in a bowl on top of a runny scoop of rice that tasted like Uncle Ben made it himself. The fish and rice was floating in a broth made of what tasted to be 90% soy sauce and 10% water.  What a terrible dish all for $22.

I tried to get in earlier reservation but was told there were no tables available until 8:15 at night. When we walked in at 8:15 there were multiple large tables unoccupied in a half empty restaurant.  After this experience I don't care to come back."}
{"text":"PHENOMENAL menu and great customer service! Tried them for the first time at their stand at the Ohio City Street Fair! The pita was brushed with this amazing butter mixture, and the lamb & chorizo meatballs were TO DIE FOR! It was accompanied with a spiced yogurt sauce and an heirloom tomato & cucumber salad. I couldn't get enough! 

I can't wait to dine in at their actual restaurant and eat my feelings! Highly recommend 10/10"}
{"text":"Excellent little hipster bistro in Ohio City section of Cleveland. Vegetarian offerings. Organic ingredients, including beef. Genuinely friendly wait staff. Parking is rough."}
{"text":"Brunch review: Flying Fig is on the pricey side for brunch entrees but the food does live up to the prices. Everything was quality, offering up many local ingredients to guide the menu. They also had a number of daily specials, all of which sounded amazing. our group tried one special - the whole wheat apple pancakes with a side of bacon which were a hit, fluffy and tender with big chunks of seasonal apple. The tallegio polenta was unique, great texture and tons of flavor with an egg that was coated in maybe breadcrumbs and super crispy. The breakfast enchiladas were amazing and they have house made green hot sauce to add if you're into that. The corn and andouille cakes were also really good, pancakes with fresh corn kernels and smokey andouille sausage. We agreed that the potatoes with the corn cakes was a bit much and might ask for a side salad instead as it's a hearty meal. The ambiance at FF was relaxed yet upscale, we look forward to returning to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Fine Ohio City restaurant, with menu that includes grass-fed burgers ( Kettering?) and other locally-based sausage, poultry and veggie specialties. Sidewalk tables are in the middle of everything, including wandering minstrel who looked and dressed like aging Thor. Waitress was attentive, funny and awesome; referencing if you want a burger that's cheaper than FF, just visit other bistros serving SYSCO frozen \"beef\" that fell off  back of a semi. :). Is this Cleveland?"}
{"text":"What a delight! visiting from Pittsburgh & found the reviews for the FF & it was open on Sunday night. Drinks amazing. Bacon wrapped figs simply delicious (I'm still thinking about them)! We got three entrees and we all cleaned our plates. Outstanding."}
{"text":"Self-realization has led me to consider my rating system, as my reviews are heavy on the 4 and 5 stars.  This has me questioning whether I'm too easy on the places I frequent and as of late, might have caused me to be a tad more critical.

But this place gets the 5 stars anyway!

I drove from Solon to try this place and though some might say simply leaving the suburbian wasteland for Foodies tilted my tastebuds in favor of Figs-a-Flying, I relent.  But it doesn't change the fact that they've got it all right in this place.

Sat at the bar, struck up conversations with locals, and realized that this place is the real deal.  It's been here for years and was using local ingredients before that was hip.

I had the special:  The Grilled Marlin with a Chimichurri that was on a bed of Spinach-infused Couscous along with roasted Carrots.  

The carrots were perfect and I'm not a fan of carrots.  I wish there were more!  As for the couscous, much the same situation.  Usually, I think couscous is overrated, but this deserved serious attention (which it got as I devoured every last morsel).

The chimichurri was a delight on the marlin and if I had to complain about anything at all, I might say that the marlin was a little unevenly cooked with one side being a little crispy.

I'm hooked.  I get to Cleveland at least once a month and now I've found a new favorite.

Oh, what a Happy Plate I had!"}
{"text":"Totally disappointed. The tempura chicken was dry and the duck confit was dry too. We came for happy hour and had some drinks but the food wasn't my cup of tea. I only like the fries and that was it."}
{"text":"Great drinks! Haven't had a chance to sample the menu, but if it's anything like their bar tending perfection, it's out if his world."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. Everyone at my table enjoyed it. Only thing I was dissatisfied with is the hosts there. We put our names down on the waitlist and never got called when our table was ready. On top of that, when we showed up to see if the table was ready, the host didnt understand that she had to call us and rolled her eyes at us. As well as have attitude. If only I could get take out here as no one should be greeted at a restaurant like that- we are paying for good service..."}
{"text":"Yum! One of my best friends introduced me to Flying Fig a few days ago for some drinks and appetizers. I got a ginger margarita which was so delicious that I actually had a dream about it the next night. No joke. I feel like all my future margaritas will be a disappointment compared to that! We split the famous tempura green beans as well as the chorizo dates with bacon. Both were great, and I could've eaten far more of them! Our server was friendly and just the right amount of attentive, and I loved the atmosphere. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best happy hours in Cleveland. I have known this for years, but sometimes I just need to remind myself. Last night I did just that. For $5, you can get the best blue cheese/bacon burger in Cleveland (I dare you to find a better one at that price), or the confit chicken legs, which I ordered for the first time last night. I have never had confit chicken legs before, and they exceeded my expectations-especially with the added touch of pickled carrots. The happy hour runs from 4-7pm Tuesday through Friday. 

If you don't make it to the happy hour, you must stop into the Market at the Fig connected to the Flying Fig. I had the best sandwich of my life there two months ago, and it has made eating sandwiches anywhere else in Cleveland difficult. The market also supplies hard to find beverages and Utz potato chips. 

The only reason I give this restaurant four stars is because the happy hour menu is limited, and the normal menu can be a little pricey, but this is one place where get your moneys worth in taste. I also commend this restaurant for always buying local, and to me, that is worth the higher price."}
{"text":"The Flying Fig was once our go-to restaurant for nice nights out or to show off the best of Cleveland to out-of-town visitors. Our last visit, however, was such a disappointment that we haven't been back in awhile. It started off fine until our server realized we weren't going to order alcoholic drinks -- and his demeanor went from friendly to cold and dismissive much the same way Bruce Banner turns into The Incredible Hulk. He treated us like teenagers who didn't deserve to be in the restaurant anymore... and that alone overshadowed the entire experience."}
{"text":"Had an amazing brunch here when visiting Cleveland! Not only was the food great but I loved the location and decor of the place. They had a nice brunch drink menu (bar area as well) and a lot of great lunch options to choose from. We started with trying a maple bacon donut which I think the name says it all. Don't really have to describe how good that was. I got the biscuits and gravy which was amazing.  The gravy, the mini biscuits and scrambled eggs were perfect. My boyfriend got a turkey club I believe which he loved as well. Service was fast and friendly and  love to come back here again."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try their brunch as I've really enjoyed the dinner and happy hour menu here. Came this past Sunday and met a girlfriend there. We were sitting for several minutes and no one had greeted us. I asked a passing server and several minutes later the same server came to our table not knowing she had us. We ordered and my girlfriend got the Cobb salad with no bacon. I ordered the corn and andouille sausage hot cakes which were pretty good. Of course the salad came out with bacon which they quickly replaced with a new one. As my girlfriend is eating, she shrieks, and a large live potato bug looking thing comes waddling out of her salad. We almost puked. We quickly got the managers attention and he joked saying it was very fresh. No apologies nor did he ask if he could get her anything else. The server came over not seeming very concerned that a live bug was in our food. She asked if she could get my friend something small. She asked for coffee and their carrot cake, which was dry and average. The bill came and sure enough our server charged her for the carrot cake and then proceeded to argue with my friend and give us plenty of attitude. My friend said she had assumed it was on the house. The server stormed off, took it off the bill and then bitched that she herself had to pay for it. 
Needless to say, this situation was handled very unprofessionally and we will never return to eat here."}
{"text":"The Flying Fig is what food should be.  The world is a better place simply because I tried this place, located in Ohio City near the Great Lakes brewpub, West Side Market, and hundreds of thugs south of Lorain Ave.

I'm sorry if I was a little more to the point that I normally am:  I am BUZZZZED now.  The cocktails served at this place is bar none.  They can be dangerous, though; they are strong and rather tasty.  They also have complimentary homemade chips at the bar they serve that are coated in salt and some other glorious seasonings.

I ended up ordering a tender loin that was covered in carrots, radishes, jalapenos, yams, and tons of other things that don't belong on a tender loin - or so you'd think.  The price is rather high, but the quality of the ingredients and the skill with which they're cooked result in this place having some of the best tender loin in the city.  Their deep-friend green beans are divine, and I hate green beans with a passion.  Green beans, along with mushrooms, are the two foods that can repel me.  I can make an exception to that rule here.

The porch in the front is intimate and allows customers to mingle and drink over...things, I guess.  Meanwhile, the way the interior is lit is simply romantic and awe-spiring.  I would absolutely go here on a date if I lived in Cleveland.

If you are looking to go on a date, this is the place.  If you are looking to go out with friends, go here, then across the street to the Great Lakes brewpub to get drunk.  You'll be thanking me."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to try the Flying Fig so I checked it out.  When I called to inquire if the meat was antibiotic free, Josh said he didn't know - that he was \"just the host\"; he repeatedly suggested I could \"look on the web\" for the answers.  Yes, really.  Finally, a manager came on the phone and supplied the product information for the business.  

With that intro, it should not have been surprising that the evening was both underwhelming and frustrating.  The offerings were surprisingly limited, the menu was inaccurate (the no substitutions rule applies to all seven (yes, only seven) entrees, not just the $22 burger as written on the menu), the staff was as ignorant and indifferent as Josh was on the phone (\"I'm just the server\"), the decor was either intentionally ironic or unintentionally hideous, and the bartender was so intent on impressing with his knowledge of aperitifs that his every booming word could be understood across the room - how sports bar.  

As far as the food, the empanada was mercifully good, the soup of the day meager, bland, and contained a common allergic ingredient that the server didn't share - \"oops\", he later said), the meat came out undercooked - TWICE (the kitchen staff seemingly intent on proving once again they were not there to accommodate paying guests), the other main course was adequate although overpriced by a third.  Thank goodness for the yummy dessert - it took some of the bitterness out of the meal.  

It's easy to see why the flying fig was mostly empty on a weekend evening.  Maybe someone should tell the owners that there is no lack of competent competitors?   Or maybe they would shrug and just say they are \"just the owners\".   Surreal.  

(The empanada and dessert merit the second star; if only a meal could be made from those - and enjoyed  offsite.)"}
{"text":"This place is cute. It's a bit over priced but I came here with a girlfriend to eat and we had a delicious meal that came out quickly. If you want to check out a little nook in the CLE area this is a good choice."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it four stars because I have only eaten here once. I also tried a very basic menu item, the ohio grass fed beef burger. The burger was $19 and damn was it good. Like real good. Like I think it beat out Heck's Cafe in my burger rank. 

I've also met with... who I think is the General Manager now, Steven and he's a cool dude. He came here from Brooklyn, NY. He said they change the menu almost daily and go with the seasons. 

Works out great because they are located so close to the Westside Market and can easily pop over to scope the pickings.

Changing the menu that often is clearly what makes this place so intriguing. It's almost like trying a new experience each time. 

Service is solid, not completely blown away but not bad. Like I said, I've been here once for dinner. 

Looking forward to going back and trying more sophisticated dishes."}
{"text":"I went to Flying Fig for the \"Independent Restaurant week\" last year. It was $33 for an appetizer, main dish and dessert. Such a great deal! I love everything that this restaurant stands for. They support local farms and try to serve dishes with as many local ingredients as possible. I chose the cheese plate as my appetizer. It came with three different cheeses and we decided to get the bread basket which offers numerous varieties of breads. For my main dish, I can honestly say that it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. It was a piece of acorn squash with quinoa, goat cheese and mushrooms on top. It was creamy, savory, flavorful and downright delicious! My dessert was some kind of apple compote with vanilla bean ice cream. A great finish to the meal. Another thing that I love about this restaurant is that they have wine on tap!"}
{"text":"A co-worker and I ate dinner here on a Friday night while in Cleveland for business. We will make sure to return every time we're back! The food was amazingly fresh, not too complicated and overdone -- just tasty creative dishes with quality ingredients. I devoured my scallops in a citrus glaze over a cauliflower puree, and my CW nearly licked her plate of halibut. We also enjoyed the calimari -- not fried, but cooked gently in a Thai-like sauce of coconut and lemongrass.

Plus they serve one of my favorite wines in the whole world -- Naia verdejo. The perfect sipping-on-a-patio wine for a balmy Friday evening."}
{"text":"Blown away by how delicious the corn cakes were! Everything on the table was delicious...highly recommend their brunch!"}
{"text":"Aaaaaand we're back! 

I can't tell you how excited I was for Flying Fig to be a Yelp Eats 2011 participant--mostly because it's been way too long since I've been back to indulge. I think it's truly safe to say that this place cannot disappoint me. 

The items on the discounted menu were truly generous and looked divine and that drink menu... it gets me every time. I'm not one for sweet cocktails, but when you have a properly-made flight 77 for me to pour down my throat, you have a happy blonde. But then you add in some Ohio rhubarb syrup? Wow. Help my life. 

After a bev or two, we were finally ready to dive into Yelp Eats. I ordered some of these famous tempura green beans for the table to share. Simple, yet delicious. I passed on the pineapple-y sweet dipping sauce, but the other was salty perfection with these crunchy green guys. Yum. As we nibbled and grazed on bread and beans, the server took our drink and food orders, not missing a beat and actually stopping to chat. How refreshing! I love it when the staff is friendly enough to engage with their guests. I'd pass on the snooty, overly-proper-types any day. 

Then came the food. Most everyone in our party ordered the glazed pork loin and absolutely loved it--as in, 100% clean plates. I was a little jealous as I saw them slice into the tender pieces of perfectly cooked deliciousness. Another one of our party ordered the burger, which was no ordinary burger. In fact, after eating every-single-thing off his plate (including fresh fries and a huge, juicy burger piled high with chihuahua cheese and onion rings), he exclaimed, \"best burger of my life.\" Then, well, that left me with the most delicious striped bass ever. Tender, a little flaky, seasoned and seared perfectly. Another clean plate without that overly-stuffed feeling. 

Once again, a gorgeous experience, Flying Fig. Thanks for hosting!"}
{"text":"Have been here for brunch twice this summer.  I got the scrambled eggs the first time and then grilled eggplant sandwich the second time. I hesitated to give this place 4 stars because both of the entrees I got were good, not amazing. The scrambled eggs lack some flavor for me.  The sandwich was jam packed with veggies (yes!), but the bread was very thick and all of the pickled things made it a little too salty.  The people who came with me to brunch (two major foodies) cleaned their plates up so I went ahead with the 4 stars. Also, service both times was great and I had a baby in tow so it was very appreciated. 

My main recommendations are the appetizers - sticky bun and olive cake.  DELICIOUS.  I enjoyed the peaches with olive cake. It was moist and with a sweet lemon flavor.  The sticky bun is what you'd expect, but still perfection.

I'd like to try Flying Fig during dinner and see if an entree wows me.  I'd still return for brunch, but would probably get a mish mash of the small bites instead."}
{"text":"Slow service... waiters forget to bring stuff the first time and food is mediocre.... not all it's hyped up to be.... dark and dirty would not recommend for lunch or weekend brunch...maybe this place would be ok for drinks after dinner, but not much else...."}
{"text":"Went here for a Friday happy hour. Ordered the kale salad, pulled-pork nachos, and the chicken meatball pizza off of the happy hour menu as well as a glass of the $5 white wine. The man friend and myself split the snacks at the bar. 

We were really surprised to find seats and an awesome parking spot, considering that we showed up ten minutes before happy hour ended (5-7pm) (due in part to the fact that RNC closures hadn't been removed as we had anticipated) yada yada detours n' all.

The food was great, especially the pulled-pork nachos. I'd easily get these again. However, service... 

Silently tries to put a finger on it... 

What I don't understand is how 2 bartenders worked this bar yet they didn't tend to their patrons. A woman at the far end of the bar spilled her water and the hostess was the only one attentive enough to recognize the spill and clean it up. You're going to say, \"Well, maybe the bar was absolutely bonkers busy since it was happy hour?\"  No, sadly you'd be mistaken. You and your hot date for the evening could have come up and grabbed a seat right then and there too. 

I have a theory. Since everyone at the bar came in for happy hour - perhaps the bartenders felt like they didn't need to provide excellent service? I'm assuming here, but that's unsettling if it could possibly be the case. Our $30 tab could have easily risen. A bruschetta that appeared to be on special that evening looked really enticing. We would have easily stayed for the special and ordered another round of drinks. But the water refills were lacking, (the boyfriend didn't even get ice in his water) and the cash-out dance took entirely too long for bartenders that clearly had the time to gab to each other. 

I base these reviews not just on how I'm treated but how I see other people being treated. And across the board service was mediocre. I'd really like to see this improve because as I said before, the food selections were great and I'd love to come back again."}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly service, but it was just missing something special for me to make it spectacular. The cocktails were very good, tasty and not strong tasting, but potent. The beef shoulder was also very well cooked, though the mashed potato puree was a bit uninspired. I enjoyed the dish throughly, but it was just good, not exceptional."}
{"text":"The best American food I ever had, everything is perfectly seasoned. Their cocktail also great, the best brunch I ever had. I would say it's the best in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing service, bloody Mary's, and BLTs!!!! I'm visiting from Nashville and This is the best!!! Thank you Tony for being the best ever!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group. We were given a menu of 6 or 7 options. I was not happy with my dish at all. It was cooked okay and came out okay, it was just completely unremarkable. Perhaps I would have better luck with a full menu."}
{"text":"***If you have diet restrictions***



For being a restaurant that claims to be vegetarian we were very disappointed. One of the members of our party has special diet restrictions for health related allergies. When ordering the waitress was rolling her eyes and was generally annoyed by how we ordered food... so off-putting When the food came out the order came out wrong, our assumption was that the waitress put it in wrong because she didn't really care. The manager did attempt to reciprocate by buying a round of drinks but the waitress ruined the dining experience at what used to be such a nice place. 


Maybe try another restaurant instead of this one."}
{"text":"Stop #2 on my wine bar crawl of Cleveland.  Really empty - just a table or two occupied, and no one at the bar except me - it was a Wednesday so I should give them the benefit of the doubt, but there were more employees than customers, and while the bartender (maybe the owner? she seemed to be in charge...) was completely attentive, I felt awkward sitting at the bar - the only customer at the bar, mind you - while a gaggle of employees chatted loudly at the end of the bar.  

Aside from that, the wine and food were lovely.  They didn't seem to have too many wines by the glass, but the one that the bartender recommended for me was very nice.  I tried the chorizo-stuffed dates that someone else here recommended and they were great - very filling, even though you only get three.  

The atmosphere, at least in the bar area, was a little trendier than I personally care for with some uber-modern art on the wall and very low lighting, but this would be a very nice impress-your-date place."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for years. Long before I became friends with the wonderful chef/owner, Karen Small.

This place is perfect. The food is delicious, farm to table, local fare. The menu is on the smaller side (my preference!) and yet I always have a hard time deciding what to order because the menu is full of things I actually want to order. I have loved every single thing I've ever ordered at Flying Fig (and I can be a little snobby).

The small outdoor seating area is my favorite place on a beautiful day, but they recently completed an interior remodel, breathing some new life into the interior design of the place.

They always have a phenomenal wine list and the talented bartenders will mix you up a mean cocktail.

Flying Fig brunch is my hands down favorite in Cleveland. Eggs for days! :)  I'm all about the grits/polenta and some yolky eggs. But they have sweet pastries and lovely bread-based dishes and even an item or two just for the kiddos (at kids' menu prices)."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Tonight was my third visit here, and it was great, as always. Amazing dates, carpaccio, calamari... The ribeye special tonight was awesome. The wait staff is great, and they work beautifully as a team."}
{"text":"I was looking for somewhere to take my in laws when we met them in Cleveland for my wife's birthday this weekend.   Since we were all traveling, I wanted a sure thing where I knew that there would be a good meal and experience.  I was sorely disappointed.

Starting from the reservations, which we made 3 weeks in advance, we had problems.  The staff at the Flying Fig screwed them up 3 separate times, one of which included accusing us of missing our reservation.  When we finally did get seated they attempted to put our party of 7 at a booth that holds 5.  After some harsh words from my wife they agreed to move us to a table.

When we did get to our table our server spoke to us like she was a kindergarten teacher teaching country bumpkins to read.  She kept saying she would be happy to explain any words that we didn't understand on the menu. 

We ordered a plethora of food including appetizers and entrees.  The burrata was a good choice but the fried green beans were no better than anything you would find at a TGI Fridays.  As for the entrees, people seemed to really like the gnocchi but I thought it was a little large to really be considered a gnocchi.  My wife had the shellfish en brudo and all of the components were cooked correctly.  My short rib was good but lacked some balance. The standout was the burger that my father in-law ordered.  The burger managed to be juicy and flavorful even after my he ordered it medium well, which I told him was a disservice to hamburgers everywhere. We ordered a few desserts to split and it really seemed to throw off the pace of the meal because they took a long time to get to our table.

The restaurant's decor is pretty trendy when you walk in but it seems to be in a little disrepair. The seat on a original booth was badly damaged and the second table that they put us at we also very beat up.  It was a little disappointing for somewhere with entrees in the mid $20's

Overall, I would say that I was disappointed in our experience.  I hadn't been to the Flying Fig in a few years but had great memories of previous visits.  Maybe my memory is failing me or they just had an off night. I gave them 3 stars instead of 2 because I know what they have been in the past."}
{"text":"Terrible service, waitress had an attitude, bug in salad with no apologies offered- rather the waitress and manager treated it as a joke. To top it off - they charged me for the mediocre dry carrot cake which was supposed to replace the salad. I refused to pay and am never going back."}
{"text":"My hubby and I got a Groupon to go here for brunch and it was a great deal! We would definitely go back at Regular price. The food was amazing, the drinks were strong and delicious and we just had the best little time. It was really accessible and the area around the restaurant wad cute too. Unfortunately I forgot to take pictures because it was so good I got distracted :) we we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to go here for YEARS... Finally got a chance, for my sisters 40th surprise brunch! Making reservations for 9 was a breeze, the restaurant told me I could bring a cake too (Maybe they have a small service charge for cutting, but we ended up not bringing a cake). The food was stellar. I enjoyed the fried chicken and egg sandwich and others at our table liked the burger, the chorizo and corn hotcakes, and pancakes. The only downfall was they were out of my first beer choice...no biggie. I would go back and order the fried chicken again without hesitation. It was crowded when we arrived at 2:00 so I would definitely make reservations. While it was affordable, it's more than Bob Evans, but you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Brunch was fabulous! Drinks were strong (and freshly squeezed grapefruit juice with my vodka made me feel like my boozy drink was healthy). I highly reccomend calling ahead, or using Open Table to make a reservation, otherwise you may find yourself eating at the bar or standing around waiting for a table. 

Haven't tried dinner yet, but I'm confident that it's equally lovely."}
{"text":"Creative menu and cocktails, nice small lot wine list. Had two appetizers- stuffed mushrooms and green beans, both excellent. Sat at the bar and Kevin did a great job of suggesting pairings - wine and cocktails. Nice atmosphere, outstanding service."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food, and a sweet little market next door. Tasty homemade cookies for dessert. The bonus is a parking lot right next door for cheap."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour a while back and had a good time! Enjoyed all the food options and strong drinks! We had a good waitress named Amy who took good care of us!"}
{"text":"Meh. This place was alright. Went for happy hour, the service was great, but the food was just okay. I got the pasta special with lamb meatballs. The meatballs were great, but overall my experience was just okay. I probably won't return. Also, we went around 5ish, but the restaurant was almost completely empty, which was very strange."}
{"text":"A-OK indeed. I think this is my third time at Flying Fig, and I'm consistently underwhelmed.  This time I went for a boozy brunch with my man.

Drinks were good. Be warned though, the market cocktail is not for the faint of heart! Quite bitter, and took some adjustment.  For food, I had the creamy goat cheese polenta. It was incredibly creamy and delicious. He had the huevos rancheros, which were average. 

I'm not sure why I'm always so underwhelmed here, I can't quite put my finger on it. The food was fine, but didn't feel special and didn't make me want to come back for more. Although our waitress was great, the ambiance left something to be desired, which may have added to the feeling.

You won't go wrong here, but if you're looking for the best brunch in CLE, I'd keep looking."}
{"text":"The Flying fig is amazing!! Great service, cozy ambience and phenomenal food!! The tap wines and the corn bread are a must as is the gnocchi. The bruschetta is also lovely...fresh and light."}
{"text":"I went to Flying Fig around Christmas time. The place is quite classy although it is a bit noisy inside. We were well attended and our waiter was very friendly and explained the menu to us very well. For appetizers, I got the beef carpaccio and although I do not eat raw beef, the carpaccio was amazing! If you eat an entire slice with a bit of the cheese in your mouth, it almost instantly melts! For entree, I had their duck breast & duck leg while my friend got their lamb with Polenta. The duck breast & duck leg is delicious. I had it cooked medium (what the restaurant recommends) and when I cut the duck leg, it was so tender and juicy. The roasted brocolli was perfectly roasted too and probably the best brocolli I've ever had! The lamb & polenta were great as well. The lamb was delicious but not as great as the duck meat. However, the polenta was great-- best ever!!! For desserts, we got their apple crisp. It was heated just right and crispy and great. The apple was crisp and sweet and nicely made. 

Overall, the quality of the food was top-notched. However, it was a bit pricey considering I was able to devour my food easily and paying almost a $100 total. I would definitely come back again for another special occasion but not a restaurant I'd be able to afford to go regularly.

Another nice to to note was that the store owner walked around the room delivering food and greeting guests which was nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Super tasty sandwiches.   Cool hood, nice staff.  On point in general"}
{"text":"We have been very anxious to try this restraint, but no more. The food and menu looked excellent but the service so poor and our server so rude we left after appetizers, which arrived well before our drinks,plates, silverware etc.and got cold while we waited.  Our initial wait for service went into the 15 minute plus range when I finally had to go into the bar to try and get drinks. On top of all of that our server helped himself to an 18% gratuity for a party of two!  He did take it off the bill at my request but the restaurant charged my account for both checks. with all the great stuff on W.25th Street this place is not worth the effort."}
{"text":"We hit this place first upon arriving to Cleveland because the kitchen is open till 11.30.  It was a good first impression of the City.  The staff was nice and informed about the options on the menu.  

The menu has some great options, the starters/little plates, I forget what they called them, were cool.  The gnocchi was excellent, mostly because the rabbit was cooked perfectly.  The stuffed pepper was also very, very good.  Spicy and the sausage was really flavorful.  The bacon rapped dates were very nice as well.  We had a salad too which was quite a small portion for the price but very tasty.

Everything was excellent, well prepared and interesting.  The special dessert of the day was great, along with the Fig and Lavender Ice Cream.  The décor is sort of boring, very non-descript and seemed to be trying too hard to be something it doesn't need to be.  Maybe it was just the area it is in trying to hard to seem cool.  Totally not necessary when your food is that good but whatever you got to do to get people in the door.

Tasty Little Fig that we really digged.


RrL"}
{"text":"Best spot in Ohio City! Can't go wrong with anything on there menu and their dessert is to DIE for ESP the chocolate molten cake :)"}
{"text":"Oh Flying Fig, how I wanted to love you, but I just couldn't. Let's start from the beginning. 

I typically don't review the decor of a restaurant on these Yelp reviews, but I just can't avoid this one. The chairs were ugly and uncomfortable, tables appeared to be made out of the same stuff has a high school cafeteria (just stained darker). The bathrooms had teenager writings and drawings carved into the stalls, the soap appears to be the 99 cent soap from a local WalMart, and the paper towels were that of a fast food chain. Not a great impression. 

We skipped the appetizers tonight in hopes of landing a great dessert. Needless to say, we never stayed long enough to even see the dessert menu. 

Drinks - I ordered the Old Fashioned. Thus is where menu problem one popped up. According to the menu I was to be charged $8 for a Jack Daniels Old Fashioned.....ummmmm excuses me? $8 for a Jack Old Fashioned? When the star of the cocktail is bourbon and you give Jack we are not off to a good start. My best upgrade available was Maker's Mark, which I still wasn't thrilled about. I also paid a couple of bucks extra to upgrade this from Jack to Makers. Definitely very disappointed. 

Entree - I order the Burger. I was super stoked to get this knowing it was purveyed from a local Ohio farmer. Grass fed Burgers are probably my favorite thing ever, besides a pork product. I ordered the burger medium and it came to the table as such. 

Problems with the Burger - it was scalding hot. The meat was not rested at all before making its way out to. About 10 minutes into my meal, my medium burger transformed into well done. The meat they used was no less than a 90-10% lean to fat ratio. In my opinion, this is much to lean for a 10 ounce burger. There needs to be some substance and juice to such a hunk of meat! The only sauce offered on the burger was a mustard aioli. This appeared to be nothing more than stone-ground mustard and mayo. Not impressive. They cheddar cheese was non-existent (I honestly could barely see it, and definitely could not taste it). The onion rings were pretty good, as well as the bacon. The house made sweet pickles were neither sweet nor pickles. It tasted like cucumber that had been pickled for less than a day or two. The fries were crispy. However, they came to the table cold and not seasoned. Very disappointed with these as well! 

The prices charge at this place are definitely not worth the quality of the food you get. My fiancée and I love going to farm to the table places and one of our favorite restaurants is one. This place gets high marks for investing into the farm to table mentality, however both or our dishes were very poorly executed.

We left Flying Fig early due to the loudness of the restaurant. We are both in our 20's and were getting incredibly annoying by the 40 and 50 somethings in the table behind out shouting and yelling throughout our dinner service. I feel that if I am paying between $25-$40 for an entrée alone, the management staff has the right to tell a table of annoying drunks to shut up. Again, very disappointed. At least a compensated drink or dessert was deserved. We were not the only couple annoying in the restaurant. 

Definitely will not be back to this one."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Flying Fig with family on a Friday night. It was only okay, which was a bit disappointing.

The restaurant itself is lovely and in a fantastic location. The service was very good and the menu looked interesting.

Unfortunately, all 4 of us were not happy with our meals. They were all just okay, boring and mediocre even. Nothing was terrible but I won't be going back, and neither will anyone that I was with. 

Perhaps we were there on an off night, but when you spend $200+ for 4 people to have dinner, you expect the food to be delicious. I wish I could say that was the case."}
{"text":"Being a tourist has its downfalls.  Knowing that you might only visit a place once in your life, you have to choose the best dish on the menu in order to have the most memorable food experience possible.  I had a magnificent, tender duck confit with cheddar mashed potatoes one Sunday night.  It was the most perfect rustic supper.  Flying Fig is worth a tourist's time and money for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent cuisine . I enjoyed the muscles with a nice spicy sauce for nap. The entrée was excellent Bolognese pappardelle. The service was excellent and attentive."}
{"text":"You must wait until their happy hour starts! Great prices and delicious burgers. My cell phone needed to be charged and the bartender let me charge it behind the bar. The pork tacos were also very good but I ordered that before I learned about their happy-hour menu! Great location, great service, great food!"}
{"text":"Wow.  This place likely takes the prize for best restaurant in the city, though it's been a few years since I've been to Lola and have yet to check out Dante.  It feels like the only place I've been to in Cleveland that could survive in NYC, Chicago or SF based solely on the concept and execution of the food.

Decor/design:  swank and modern but totally comfortable in it's backed off minimal approach.  The service mirrored the decor...relaxed, but friendly.

As for the food...

Medjool dates - possibly the best take on \"devils on horseback\" I've ever had - chorizo, smoked bacon and paprika...no almond inside, but that was a nice change up, and who cares anyways when the chef lets the natural sweetness of the date come though without having to resort to using a maple glaze.  The chorizo is a brilliant idea.  Delicious.

Antipasto plate - one of the nicest (and largest) I've seen to date, full of an amazing array of small bites:  marinated olives, cured meats, a few different cheeses, nuts, roasted peppers, pickled fennel?, crostini, and chicken liver pate.  Really nicely done, with some thought and effort put into the dish instead of the usual boring, played out offerings.

Tempura Green Beans w/ ponzu sauce and pineapple caramel - these things were so good I could've eaten the entire plate on my own.

As for the main, the pork chop was incredible, and I don't say that lightly given some takes I've had at spots like Babbo, etc.  The chop is from New Creation farm, which is a family farm in Geauga County...you can totally taste the difference between these types of pigs vs. those from larger industrial farms.  Berkshire, to be exact...which is pretty much the dog's bollocks for me.  Done with a bourbon reduction, caramelized brussel sprouts and cheesy grits.  One of the tastiest, most satisfying pork entrees ever.  A1+.

So, yeah - this place deserves all the praise it gets."}
{"text":"This is the best brunch in Cleveland!  And they also have one of the best happy hours as well.  It is in a fun spot in Ohio City near the Westside Market and Great Lakes Brewery.  The menu is full of seasonal options and everything from the appetizers to entrees are made fresh and just right.  The Croquet Madame is my favorite when on the menu."}
{"text":"Service was superb. Bacon covered dates and chocolate ganache dessert were my personal favorites."}
{"text":"Insanely pleasurable cuisine at odds with its surrounding and service. The simple greens salad was fresh, crisp, and imaginatively interpreted (why is it called \"simple\"?). Pappardelle Bolognese almost made us cry - thoughtfully sourced ingredients prepared lovingly. And the Brussels sprouts? Oh, mamma, the maple is subtle but infatuation-inducing. The terrific wines by the glass offerings, while frugally poured, round out a stellar gastronomic experience. Detractions: a dated and somewhat tired dining room staffed by t-shirt wearing, shoulder-shrugging hipsters gamely tolerating the clientele. One of the best meals in Cleveland, but don't bother getting dressed up for it."}
{"text":"Perfect place for lunch after shopping at West side market .  Had a great German beer , our starter of calamari & wild shrimp w a lemon aioli was done perfect . Then I enjoyed their beet salad which was on the small side however made up for it with the best creamy 6 min egg . Also enjoyed was their 10 oz burger with yummy fries that we could have ate as a meal. 
  Severs was great and everything was described to us .They had a daily special w a vegan soup offered . 
   A must if  vegaterian or not . Be prepared for some food to have smaller servings . Myself I enjoy small plates which allows me to sample more on the menu . Cost for lunch was perfect at under $50 . This was with 2 drinks ."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I went for brunch with my family back in December. Some of the best coffee I've had in my entire life. I had the Kitchen Sink Skillet, and it was wonderful. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"What an awesome little restaurant AND market. I like that you have to walk through the market to get actually get to the restaurant. Gives people a chance to see the awesome wine selection. 

My guest and I were seated right away because we were there before they opened. Our server was polite and cheerful, which was an awesome surprise because early Sunday morning can sometimes suck. 

I ordered the bourbon sticky bun, quiche and some coffee. 
The coffee was delicious!  Definitely wasn't expecting it to taste so good. 
The sticky bun was mouth watering. You could most definitely see the bliss on my face after every bite, it was definitely my sweet treat for the day. 
The special wad a Cheddar, kale and Shallot quiche with a small arugula salad. 
I usually don't eat scrambled eggs, but it sounded too good. So I dove right in. The texture was fantastic, lite and fluffy. The flavors exploded on my tongue. It was definitely a delicious piece of breakfast pie. 

It was a pretty fantastic breakfast. I'll definitely be back. 
The one down side is the parking situation. It's terrible! $6 to park in a public parking lot? Or you can park and walk a few miles. It's a bit silly."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch with my mom. It's farm to table so everything is really fresh. Smaller menu and not as many vegetarian options as I thought they'd have. We both ended up getting the vegetarian frittata special. It was really good, great flavor but pretty big. It came with a small side salad with their house dressing. The salad was delicious and fresh. Although what I had was delicious not sure if I'll go back right away simply because there wasn't as many vegetarian/vegan options for me. But if you're a meat eater then I'd say try it, I'm sure they're really good based on what I saw"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch this past weekend.  Was told it would be  a 40 min. Wait which was fine.   They call you on your phone when ready so you can walk around.  

We were called back within 15 min. And asked if we wanted a bar spot and we took it.

The servers/bartenders are super nice.  My Irish coffee was perfect.  And the food, the food was amazing!   Omg.  Loved the biscuits and gravy , truly a must if you visit.  I forget what my friend got, but it had pork and was a more Mexican inspired dish, but they truly enjoyed their food as well.   

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The fig has one of the best brunches around. I've yet to try their dinner menu, but let's talk brunch food. 
I have never been disappointed with the menu or options. 
The atmosphere is very relaxed and welcoming. Our server this past visit was a gem. Sorry I'm not certain her name. She was very well informed with the menu, dietary restrictions, and made sure to tell us about the specials for the day. 
My husband ordered the special of a grilled cheese, with their loaded breakfast potatoes. He was loving that grilled cheese. And you can't go wrong with any sort of loaded potatoes. I ordered the avocado toast, and added an egg to it. WOW WOW WOW!!!!!! It is by far the BEST avo toast I have ever had, and I would like to think of myself as a connoisseur in that department. It had almond butter, arugula, bacon( gave that to the hubs) and the bread itself was awesome! I think after every bite I said aloud THIS IS AMAZING!!! 
I also made room for the breakfast potatoes, which are phenomenal as well. 
If your thinking of trying a new brunch spot look no further than the flying fig. 
Can't wait to try out their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Wow wow !. My wife and I came for sunday brunch,got a table as walked right in. We shared the special today ,the Apple cinnamon pancakes and also had the soft scrambled eggs.... wasn't a flaw in it. The pancakes were light and fluffy and so full of flavor . The eggs were plentiful and cooked just right,the added seasoning was  very complimentary.  All the sides were great ... bacon,potatoes  and the salad"}
{"text":"Service was very good. I was not extremely impressed with the overall food.. it was fairly mediocre especially with the amount of reviews talking it up. The wine selection was great, my only wish is that there was a Sauvignon blanc from New Zealand! I had the walleye which was very good but did not have a ton of flavor. The short rib special was good just not spectacular. I wasn't disappointed in this place but I also wasn't impressed. It was just okay. Prices overall were decent. Selection was decent, bummed the duck isn't on the menu anymore. Just nothing that made me want to run back unfortunately."}
{"text":"An undrinkable bloody Mary bad service disappointing food. This used to be a favorite restaurant terribly disappointed eve"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful Saturday brunch here. The ingredients were all great and the portions were perfect--enough to be satisfied but not too big. The meatballs in particular were excellent. Definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"Had brunch at Flying Fig with some friends from out of town. Great service, delicious brunch food! Had the avocado toast but it was very difficult to choose. I highly recommend making a reservation. It was quite busy even though they had just opened. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour on a Wednesday with my boyfriend, brother, and sister-in-law. Even though we were the only people in the place, we had a great time! Their happy hour menu is delicious and we ordered just about every item on it. The mac n cheese is amazinggg and the bartender said their $7 burger - which my boyfriend devoured in 5 minutes flat - is normally $22! I think this is an excellent place to go with some friends and grab a drink and bite to eat, but probably not the place to go if you're solo looking to find people to hang out with. We left around 4:30/5 though so it's possible it gets busier later. 

TL;DR cheap happy hour, delicious food, not a busy place during early evening hours. 10/10 would go again"}
{"text":"First time diners on Sunday night. The staff was friendly and professional, the atmosphere cozy and the food delicious!"}
{"text":"I have not yet been here for dinner, but I was here for brunch several weeks ago.  The service was good and the portions were decent.  I though the food was good, but a little pricey for what I got.  Definitely worth a try though!"}
{"text":"An amazing little bar and restaurant nestled in the large looming shadow of Great Lakes brewery. Sure the prices of some menu items might be a little high, but the presentation, ingredients and service make it worth the extra penny.  The beer selection is small but well thought out, as well as the cocktail list. The ambiance was great and included a nice little patio in the front. I had the flatbread appetizer with two pints of north coast scrimshaw Pilsner. It was the perfect amount of food and beer, would recommend to anyone that happens to make the same mistake I did... Going to G.L. On the one day they are closed!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited here looking for a nice little place to enjoy a weekend meal.  Although we didn't have any expectations (other than the 4.5 star yelp rating), we left a little disappointed.  The environment was nice,but the comfort was below average.  The chairs were small and wobbly and the tables were close enough together to hear what was going on with the neighbors sick grandma and the difficulty of her partners work/life balance.  
The food was good, but not great either.  Lets start with the basics - the bread.  As you can see by my photo, the bread just didn't do it. The olives were good (not to lolita standards), and the salads were literally iceberg lettuce smothered in oil.  The highlight of the meal was the hangar steak, but it was covered in caramelized onions which overpowered the steak itself.  
We both had a drink, an appetizer, a salad and we shared an entree and were out the door for $75.   All in all, not a bad spot, but I expect a little more for the pricetag."}
{"text":"I stopped by here earlier today for brunch with my wife.  The inside of the flying fig has an industrial like feel to it with exposed ductwork (painted white), hanging lights that look like they are from a construction site and grey, black and white colors.  There is a bar at the front of the restaurant and then a number of tables and booths in the back all done in black and silver.

For brunch my wife and I decided to start off our meals by splitting a sticky bun which our server had informed us had just come out of the oven.  Then for my entree I ended up ordering the maple bacon chicken sandwich while my wife went with the heuvos rancheros.  Our shared sticky bun came out first and was still warm from the oven.  It was pretty good and at different points of eating I was able to get the flavors of both honey and butter.  After we had finished that we had only a short wait before our entrees came out.  My sandwich was supposed to consist of pulled chicken, candied bacon, herb whipped feta, pickled fresno chilies, greens all on a ciabatta roll with a side of chips.  My sandwich tasted quite good since the chicken was moist, the bacon crispy and the arugula gave it some nice peppery flavor.  However I was confused as to why it was called a maple bacon sandwich as I wasn't getting any maple or candied flavor off the bacon at all.  Beyond that I didn't really notice the pickled Fresno chiles which when combined with the maple name were two of the reasons that I ordered the sandwich.  It was still a good sandwich but it certainly didn't blow me away.  My wife ended up sharing some of her heuvos rancheros with me which was great seeing how I had been debating about ordering it myself.  It was a solid dish but I ended up happy that I ordered the chicken sandwich instead.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  My wife and I both enjoyed our meals and I liked the atmosphere of the place and loved that they use local ingredients."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the rage is about this place. The food was mediocre at best and the restaurant itself is poorly designed - I could clearly hear the conversation at the bar from my table 6 feet away. I think I'd rather spend my time and money somewhere where there's more of a guarantee for good food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really didn't think hipsters existed in Cleveland until I visited this establishment. That being said, the food was pretty good. I had the bbq beef hash and was not disappointed. My eating companion had the meatballs, of which I had half. It was almost worth the subsequent interminable indigestion I experienced. The atmosphere felt pretentious which was confusing because the rest of the city was very friendly and inviting. The drinks were expensive for Cleveland and also the booth seats were at an acute angle to the table, which caused me back pain and discomfort. The complimentary butter and fig jam was exquisite and a pleasant surprise. Overall it was ok. I wouldn't go back though; I would try to find a more Cleveland-y place to get a good brunch - notably the Great Lakes brewpub across the street which was closed because it was Sunday."}
{"text":"If I could give Flying Fig 3.5 stars I would. I feel like I am cheating the establishment a little only giving 3 stars, but given the choice of \"A-OK\" and \"Yay! I'm a fan!\" I lean toward A-OK.

First, I need to give the folks there major props for being so nice. Our reservation on Open Table never made it into their system and yet they were more than willing to accommodate us on a Friday night. I was honestly expecting to be told that we were SOL, but they were awesome. 

The French 77 is a great cocktail. I drink St. G and 'pagne pretty regularly, but never with fresh lemon juice. It tasted like British lemonade. Yum. The small plates are really the stars here. The bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo were phenomenal. The stuffed banana peppers were really amazing as well. 

Entrees were a bit more \"meh\". The hangar steak was flavorful, but the chimicurri-style sauce overpowered the beef. The short rib was much better; it had a nice combination of caramelized exterior with tender beef flavored by fat renderings. Both the roasted potatoes with the hanger steak and the mashers with the short rib needed more salt. They were flat, bland.

Dessert was lovely: fresh, housemade doughnuts; two kinds served with an amazing fig compote. Perfect to split between two people to end the meal. 

I think Flying Fig really wants to be a tapas style restaurant and offers entrees for those who aren't ready for tapas. Given that, I would stay away from the entrees and order up all of their small plates and sample and enjoy. It is a much more enjoyable experience than the normal courses, anyway!"}
{"text":"Went here with the 'rents for dinner on my last trip to cleveland.  We decided to branch out from our usual trip to Lolita and, while Flying Fig was very good, I would rather go back to Lolita.

Chorizo Stuffed Pepper appetizer special - yum.
Bacon-wrapped dates - pretty good.
fried green beans with dipping sauce - my personal favorite app.
I had the pork belly with roasted squash.  delicous
mama had the osso buco and i had to convince her to eat the marrow - she loved it!
pops had the short ribs.  eh.
beau had the hanger steak (which they actually refuse to serve above medium!) - the meat was really flavorful.
None of the desserts peaked our interest.

summary: good food but when we only get one meal out in cleveland, i'm going to lolita."}
{"text":"The Flying Fig is a great restaurant spot in a bustling area of Ohio City close to many other restaurants and shops and a hop away from the Westside market. 

I came here for brunch with a few friends and was pleased with the menu options for brunch. Coffee was great and I was extremely happy with the polenta order that I made. The polenta was creamy and had the right amount of additions in mushrooms and kale to provide some texture and complexity to the dish. My friends orders of sausage and biscuits and the breakfast sandwich special was also well received. 

We had reasonable service with our waters and coffee staying full throughout our meal. It was a bit slow at times with significant time going between our drink order, meal order, and arrival. Still, people were friendly and it wasn't absurdly slow, but definitely not a place to go if you're in a rush.

Bottom line, with a good menu, location, food, and reasonable service, the flying fig should definitely be a consideration if you're looking for a good restaurant in the Ohio City area."}
{"text":"Apparently this place just doesn't care about it's customers. 

I sent an email about our mediocre meal, and no response. I waited a week to post this review in case it was a bad day, chef was sick, whatever, but management didn't care to reply.

In short it was VERY disappointing. Although we arrived for brunch at 1, we learned the Maple Chicken was already gone, which we were informed of after two of our party had ordered. 

I ordered the BBQ Brisket Hash, not good. The promised mushrooms, potatoes and peppers were hard to find, so not sure what made this a hash, mostly just lumps of brisket in a sauce that was very vinegary. After a few bites, no thanks. This just didn't compare to a GOOD barbecue beef brisket, not sure why you would serve something so mediocre.

One of our party asked for a skillet scramble without the peppers, answer was no.

Not one of our party of five was pleased by their meal. Only compliment, one person enjoyed the lamb sausage. There was just nothing special about the food.

We were really disappointed to have made the drive, there are far better and apparently more caring restaurants to enjoy."}
{"text":"Great experience last night at flying fig!  We have been here several times before and it's always very good. They have excellent vegetarian options. We started out with the burrata which was fantastic. For dinner I had the hoisin glazed Cleveland tofu which was great. The husband ordered short ribs which blew him away. They have a great wine list and a very good beer list. Our service was top notch and the atmosphere is very nice."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch spot with unique entrees that are all guaranteed to be delicious. It's worth noting it is on the pricier side, but if you're looking to treat yourself, head here and be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"The bacon wrapped dates in the trio dinner option are incredible.

I will never look at dates the same again."}
{"text":"i would give this place a 1star based on how rude the short pudgy bartender/floor manager was to us when we walked in there- a snarky & pretentious \"can i help you?\" as if he had no idea we were there to eat? other than that, the service is great, the food was great. probably one of the best burgers in cleveland. i've also been to their brunch which is usually pretty good, not too filling but you dont leave feeling like you need to go home and take a nap. the bloody marys are also pretty amazing- as long as they remember to use the bloody mary mix and not just tomato juice. so all in all, i would have rated this place much higher if it werent for how rudely we were treated when we first walked in the door."}
{"text":"Yummm. I am so into the Flying Fig, & I LOVE supporting one of the best female chefs in the city. Flying Fig's menu is traditional but creative, nothing too \"out there\" but everything with enough of a twist to keep you interested - & of course, all of it is DELICIOUS. 

They've got a nice happy hour. Though it's still a little bit on the expensive side as CLE happy hours go, you can get a full meal & a beer or wine apiece for under $10 total, which makes it a great deal for the Fig's regular pricing. I like their pulled pork nachos (so crispy & not-mushy!), & my boyfriend is a sucker for their burger.

They've also got a tasty brunch that's not too pricey. I visited during Passover, so my food options were pretty limited, as the menu is bread-heavy, but I pulled together a nice meal of sides: grapefruit \"brulee,\" boiled with brown sugar; a side of taleggio polenta with a nice red sauce; & \"loaded\" breakfast potatoes topped with bacon, onions, & cheese, truly the best I've ever had. Can't stoop dreaming about those potatoes. My mom had the polenta entree, which came with veggies & made her The Happiest. 

I like that the Fig is small & low-key, a little bit on the pricier side but not overly trendy. The food is simple & outstanding, not pretentious or trying too hard - just really damn good."}
{"text":"Based purely on the brunch....I still dream of the migas (best ever per this displaced Texan) and the pastry basket.  Oh my!  Juice was delish, but yes a bit overpriced.  I'll be back often to check out the other menus, but brunch will be hard to beat."}
{"text":"At last I finally squeezed Flying Fig into my plans during a visit back to Cleveland. My friend and I ventured down for dinner on a Saturday. It took some effort to find a parking spot behind the market, but we were able to get a seat at the restaurant without a wait. 

Once inside we saw the board of specials. I like that the restaurant has a focus on local foods and the regular menu and specials board reflect that. I also really liked the variety of portions available. The menu offers salads, small plates, and entrees. The cocktail menu looked great though I had to pass on this particular evening.

I started with Tempura Green Beans which had a light tempura batter that wasn't greasy and was finely seasoned. The pineapple caramel sauce and ponzu sauce both tasted great with the green beans, but the pineapple caramel was my favorite. This starter would be plenty for two to three people since it was a generous appetizer portion.

For my entrée I went with the Charred Asparagus Nicoise Salad and a small plate of Beef Short Rib. The salad had a nice bed of dressed greens with a topping of charred asparagus, tomatoes, potatoes, feta, and olives. On the side was a perfectly prepared soft boiled egg. I loved the flavor combination. The short rib was tender and nicely flavored. It was served with more fat than other restaurants serve, but it wasn't too bad. My friend enjoyed the Ham Special which looked delicious and was a large dinner portion. She said she really enjoyed her meal.

Dessert for both of us was the Fig \"Split\". Oh, my. This was so delicious. I'm glad we each ordered our own instead of trying to split one split, pun intended. I was sold at griddled sticky bun. On top of the delicious sticky bun was caramelized banana, vanilla ice cream, caramel, whipped cream, chocolate, and a cherry. The flavors came together so well for a truly decadent dessert. I would return for this dessert alone.

Our service was pretty good. The waitress was nice, but not over the top friendly. Her whole tone changed when we politely asked for two checks. It took her all of 30 seconds to get this for us so I can see why she was so troubled by the request (insert sarcasm). It wasn't even a busy evening since an organized run in the area seemed to deaden the usual Saturday night crowds. 

Overall, I was very pleased with this restaurant. I love restaurants that focus on local foods since fresh foods really speak for themselves in a dish. I also love that the menu changes based on seasonal selection so even a frequent diner will always have something new to taste. I'll definitely try to make it back on future visits to the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Had a great date night here. I've been meaning to eat here for a long time, as it's hard to find delicious vegetarian options in the Cleveland area.

Husband and I shared the bruschetta...super delicious! We both had the Goat Cheese Salad; definitely one of the best salads I've had (being a vegetarian, I've had more than my share!). May just be because I love goat cheese...and they use Mackenzie Creamery goat cheese. Score! I ordered the gnocchi, sans prosciutto, for my entree. The gnocchi were perfect pillows of potato goodness. Seasoned perfectly, and the shaved veggies added great texture. Just wish there was more!!!

All in all, the chef is doing a great job with the flavor profiles. Would definitely go back again :)"}
{"text":"Had duck salad.     The main courses were light and tasty.   

Waiter service was excellent, if not too attentive.    Desert was amazingly slow to arrive, perhaps they had to go shopping for a missing ingredient."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant, and I've gone here for many a celebratory dinner.  But, I'd like to note that their menu changes very frequently based on the current produce that is in season in the local farms.  Before you decide to try something at this restaurant mentioned in any of the other reviews, you might want to call and make sure they have it.

That being said, everything I've ordered at this restaurant has been excellent.  The portions are very large as well.  If they are available on the menu, try the short ribs or the bouillabaise.  For dessert, the bread pudding is PHENOMENAL - if they have it.  Also, the tempura green beans appetizer (which is the one thing that has always been offered when I've been here) is seasoned quite well, and they give you a heaping pile of them, which you will gobble up quickly like potato chips or edamame.  In addition, the service here is very good and they refill your water consistently.  And I've never been here for happy hour but I heard that it was great too.

One last thing - parking may be difficult at this restaurant if the neighboring lot is full.  It was full half of the times I've gone here."}
{"text":"I can't stress enough how fantastic this place is.  The service is amazing.  Start with the sticky buns, then go ahead and order the corn cakes.  I've only been here for brunch, but I have to imagine that the rest of their menu is just as good. It can be difficult to get a seat, but that's an easy problem to fix.  Make a reservation."}
{"text":"Sad to say I finally found a CLE brunch place that I don't plan to go back to. They have limited selection for breakfast based food and most things on the menu are just too crazy/fancy, for my preference at least. I enjoy a good classic breakfast that has toast, eggs, bacon, potatoes, etc, which Flying Fig has.....for guests under the age of 12. I tried to order an adult version and they said that's not possible. So I made my own and just ordered a side of potatoes and side of bacon. Their main pancakes are made out of corn, which could very well be good, but alas I'm a sweet not savory bruncher. 

A few people in the group got biscuits and gravy which they said was good, but the biscuits were literally the width of a quarter!! They tempt you with huge biscuits for sale up front, but only put 4-5 mini ones in the dish which I would find disappointing. 

Best thing about this was the sticky bun I tried though. Highly recommend that if you go, order the sticky bun!! Super fluffy, sweet, and worth it. 

Did they have food that was good quality and tasted good? Yes. That cannot be argued, just wish the menu catered to the true breakfast food lovers (French toast, pancakes, waffles, a basic breakfast, etc.)."}
{"text":"Flying Fig is tops in my book. Found it here on Yelp, so thank you Cleveland Yelpers! Last night tried the dates, broccoli cheddar soup, and short ribs. All good. Friendly staff, excellent atmosphere."}
{"text":"I must say, Flying Fig has always been a favorite.  Not sure if it was just an off night, but went last night for the appetizer menu which sounded fabulous, as always.  The food my friend and I both had, just fell flat.  The burger and the fries were flavorless, tasteless, not even  just ordinary.  My friend had the chicken chorizo empanada, which at first,  the waitress brought her the chicken dumplings, instead.  When they brought her the empanada, my friend said tasted like they took it out of a box from the freezer and reheated it.  

Hoping this was an off night and not a change in chef, management or philosophy."}
{"text":"This has become my go to spot for brunch in CLE. Everything I have had on the menu is outstanding. The sticky bun is perfectly sweet, and whoever goes to brunch with me that day has no option but to share it with me when we go. The decor is quaint and overall, it's such a good experience. I recommend making reservations for brunch on the weekends. No wait that way! I have only been here for brunch, but it's truly an incredible spot."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and delicious, with seasonal menu items. The risotto was cooked perfectly, and the outside seating is great."}
{"text":"Visiting a friend from out of town and came here for dinner as this place had been on her radar to check out. Loved the romantic ambiance and dimmed lights inside. We were seated promptly and had a nice chat with our waitress on recommendations and favorites. We started with the chicken dumplings, which were tasty and not soggy etc. For the entree I went with the one dish that stuck out from the rest (since it had Asian influence and the rest of the menu was American/European). It ended up being dynamite! The tofu bowl was delicious! There were 3 sizable pieces of tofu glazed with hoisin sauce and cooked perfectly on a bed of jasmine rice and complimented by avocado, cucumbers, shredded carrots, cilantro, and red bell peppers. It all came together for a fantastic filling meal! This looks like a place where the menu changes occasionally so try this out while it's on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad experience for someone that doesn't eat healthy. If u like carbs and lots of them, then this place is not for you. Thankfully they have Cleveland Bagel company bagels to save the day! I had my first quiche today. It was actually really good. If you have a thing with scrambled eggs needing to be hard, then don't eat this. Just an FYI! Their coffee was amazing! I really enjoyed the coffee. The quiche had kale in it which is actually a really great touch and which is why I enjoyed it so much. There was a balsamic dressing on the plate. Oh, and there were apple strips in the greens that was a nice surprise.  
The place filled up quickly. The seating is a bit odd. They put us, two fluffy people, in the worst spot so when I was leaving I was almost in the people's next to me lap. So best bet to sit at the bar to be honest. You will have some room. The location is ok. Pay to park is the easiest way to get parking but if you want free, find a spot on the street and walk. 
The waitress was super sweet and always checked on us. The coffee was always filled. She made the experience better. It's a bit pricey. $20 for a bagel, quiche and coffee. So be prepared to spend $$"}
{"text":"I have gone many times and been without seating so definitely make a reservation!

The food here is great, comparable in style and quality to Crop just around the corner but without the ridiculous prices. Also much more \"down to earth\" and welcoming. I appreciate their seasonal menu that is often changing. In over 20 visits I have yet to be disappointed with a meal."}
{"text":"The staff are all friendly and accommodating - sitting outside on a chilly morning they stopped by to see if we wanted to move inside, or if not, she had an armful of thick warm blankets we could use. The food is great, the drinks are wonderful, and it's a perfect spot for people watching."}
{"text":"Friend brought me here. Superb stuff.

Great vibe (think farm-to-kitchen style, dimly lit, but comfy and elegant), and the drinks were on point. Price was a little high, but the food was tasty.

Go ahead and treat yourself to the bacon-wrapped dates. Delicious; the paprika wasn't the obvious choice, but goes surprisingly well with the tomato sauce.

Pork chops were cooked well; not too tough, but not undercooked. Very juicy still. The accompanying sides (spinach? Or some other leafy greens) were well marinated in the sweet savory sauce.

Also, drinks are great. Choose to your liking! They all tasted decent. Of note: they mix egg whites into some drink to achieve frothiness. First time I've seen it done with cocktails, but it works well."}
{"text":"I was here on a business trip with a couple of co-workers. After reading a couple of reivews, we decided that the Flying Fig had an interesting list of choices. The Flying Fig is hidden in a small alley with a stylish image. 

We started off with the Trio - (3 appetizers of your choice) and Flatbread. We chose the gnocci, dates, and scallops for the Trio.  Everything was amazing! I've never had better scallops! 

I ended up getting the seared scallops for my entree - very reasonably priced - $19.  The scallops were tender, flavorful and seared to perfection - not too undercooked or overcooked. 

For dessert, we shared a Peach and Raspberry Cobbler along with the Salty Caramel Ice Cream and Fig Ice Cream.  This made my night! 

I would definitely come back here when I'm in Cleveland again!"}
{"text":"First Visit! Nice atmosphere helpful and personable staff! The young man who waited on us was very knowledgeable about the menu and made us feel very comfortable in making our choices!The crepinette I ordered was delicious, fresh and filling!! 
   The lovely owner ,Karen, and I share the same birthday we learned when she came by to conversate with us!
   I will definately recommend this resturant and will be returning!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was pretty disappointed by this place. I'm giving it 3 stars for service and quality of food, but our brunch wasn't anything memorable. 

I had the frittata in the skillet which was pretty dry. They cooked it twice to get the look in the fluffy skillet but my actual eggs were over cooked. My husband had a sandwich that was pretty plain as well."}
{"text":"Chef and owner Karen Small has been doing a lot right at Flying Fig for a long time. Lots of local ingredients backed by creativity and talent. It may sound like your typical farm-to-table place, but she was doing it before it became the latest hipster craze. If you're on a budget and want to enjoy some of the fare for less at lunchtime, try going next door to their little store and carryout."}
{"text":"Incredibly delish!!!  Wish I lived closer to this place.  Creative, healthy, yummy and lovely staff, too.  I brought a large party and they were quite accommodating."}
{"text":"With so many rave reviews I can't add much . We went for Sunday Brunch. Great food, beautiful outdoor seating, knowledgeable and friendly server. It exceeded my high expectations. Grateful that a place like this exists and I plan on returning often in the future. (The sausage biscuits and gravy were outstanding!)"}
{"text":"Tried the restaurant week menu here.  For the most part- delicious.  For appetizers, the chicken livers are tender on the inside, flavorful, with a nice breadcrumb crust on them.  The dates were also very good- a mix of sweet with smokey bacon and spicy chorizo.  For the entrees- Hanger steak- Tender! Great flavor!  Probably the best tasting steak I've had in some time.  The scallops with pasta- well, just OK.  The scallops were great, and the ingredients in the meal themselves tasted good on their own, but when combined, I felt like they were lacking a cohesiveness to make the dish taste just right.  Dessert was great- had some chocolate banana bread pudding and tried some apple tart.  Both had great flavor and were a perfect finish to our meals.  

The meals are good sized portions, and we had very attentive service.  I'd definitely like to go here again (but I will not order scallop pasta next time)."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. I loved being able to eat outdoors. The food was fresh and very delicious I ordered the croak madame came out piping hot. I asked for the eggs to be punched on top which I think was a good decision. Definitely more than enough food to share. The bloody Mary's were exceptional. The other people I went with also got drinks And were very satisfied.Wait staff was very attentive and the establishment in general is very well-run. We came on a Sunday around 10 AM and didn't really have to wait at all. There is an open market right next to the restaurant and we were able to do a little shopping after French set a location was convenient. 

I would definitely come back here, think it might be a nice place to try for lunch. Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm shocked I've never been here before.  Came for brunch today and it wasn't too crowded which was refreshing.  Started with the cinnamon bun and olive oil cake-both delicious.  This sounds so silly but the bread and butter was SO good, I swear the butter was extra salty or something.  Just delicious.  I got the turkey sandwich on caramelized onion bread and holy smokes was it delicious.  The bread was TO DIE for.  Homemade pickles on the sandwich hit the spot.  One person I was with got the polenta and cleaned her plate and the other person got the croque madame.  The sandwiches were huge and we both took half home.  Theres a market attached to the restaurant that serves sandwiches and has items to buy.  I'll definitely be back to try the dinner menu.  I was super impressed."}
{"text":"honestly... i chose this place because.... Lola isn't opened on Sunday and we only had Sunday free! oh well... it was a pleasant experience afterall... but 4 stars? i don't know... i'd give it a 3.5 if i could...

everyone says the bacon wrapped dates is a must try... but some of us don't eat bacon, some of us careless about the dates... so we missed it... we probably should have ordered it anyways? because the food to me is really average... nothing really stands out... besides the bread and the desserts! 

bread oh bread... we asked for more bread three times!!! it was that tasty!!! for the desserts, try the bread pudding and the warm chocolate cake, both very yummy... 

service was good too... we didn't know that the soup we ordered was 'chilled' and the server was nice enough to take it back and take it off from the bill (after all 5 of us took a sip... lol)

the neighborhood is quiet and pretty at night... 

perhaps what we had at Moxie the night before was much better that's why we didn't care too much here... but check it out! not bad!"}
{"text":"Really great brunch experience! It starts with the great customer service. We called to inform them that we would be about 5 minutes late and they responded \"take your time. Your table will be here when you arrive\". It was so reassuring to know that on a busy Sunday they were willing to hold our spot. Once we arrived we started with sticky buns and the olive oil cake. Omg both were great! The big hit of the day was the polenta entree. It was amazing! The ratatouille that came on top was a perfect compliment and that crispy egg on top was just to die for. Bravo. Such a great meal!"}
{"text":"On a busy Saturday, the manager was very considerate to all us walk-ins, found seats for parties quickly. Contrast to Great Lakes Brew House, across the street, with an hour-and-a-half to two hour wait. Could not possibly have been worth that. 

Burger and enchilada were very good, service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Not an amazing experience.

The wall near us was completely scraped off by the table and the dance music (with no dancing, of course, this is a sit-down restaurant) was too loud for the small space.

If a guest doesn't want fries with their burger, a restaurant with prices as high as the Flying Fig's are should be able to afford to substitute sides. It seems a little silly to say that it's fries or nothing. (Or you can add $5.50 to your bill to have something different with your $19 burger). This was after they said I couldn't have the restaurant week lamb burger fixings with the regular burger (they sounded fun, but I don't really like lamb.) I understand integrity of a dish, but it's not like I was asking for something crazy, hard to do, or wasteful. 

It is a good burger, though. Crunchy bacon paired with melted onions and cheese on top. House-made ketchup.

The service is rather underwhelming. Slightly condescending, but yet doesn't know the answers to seemingly simply questions. No one really needs to be told that the menu has information on it....

During the couple of times I've been here, they made themselves out to be too pretentious compared to the results. Something about the experience has to be amazing to warrant any level of pretension."}
{"text":"Ambiance was great, food was very good, and our waiter was great .  A touch on the pricy side, which is the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars.  We will be going back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a whim while waiting for our friends. I was definitely not expecting it to be as fancy on the inside and unfortunately I was wearing jean shorts and a t-shirt, so I felt really underdressed. We sat at the bar and for some reason I was having a really hard time choosing what I wanted to drink. The wonderful bartender sensed my decision despare and offered to make me something she thought I might like. I'm not sure exactly what was in it besides fancy gin and champagne, but WOO! My head was foggy after that, not to mention it was downright delicious. Lemon-y with a kick! I always appriciate a bartender who takes the time to really help you when you are unsure of an order.

After our tasty drinks we ordered the lettuce wraps as a late night snack. WOW, were they good. I don't take my wraps of any kind lightly when it comes to rating...but I was impressed. If you ask me the pickled carrots made the dish. What an awesome spin on an already wonderful appetizer! I would LOVE to give this a five star rating, but I feel like I need to try a full meal before that. Obviously I will not be hesitant to return for the meal and the review update! An Ohio City gem ladies and gentleman."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this restaurant, because who doesn't love a good farm to table restaurant? However, I felt that some of the food really shouldn't have made it to the table. 

I came here for dinner with a large group of people and ordered the pan seared walleye with bacon & potato salad on the side. There wasn't anything extraordinary about the walleye. It was bland and boring. The potato and bacon salad was unique and quite good, but I didn't pay $24 for bland fish and a small side salad. A friend ordered the grass fed burger which he stated was good, but not amazing and certainly not worth the price. I also agree with many other reviewers that have stated the portions sizes are small. Looking around the table at my friends' orders, many of the appetizers and entrees looked miniscule. I was expecting a lot more from a restaurant with so much hype. But alas, they can't all be winners."}
{"text":"Came for brunch. I've never been before, so I really enjoyed the location, atmosphere, and food. Brunch prices were a little weighty though, for smallish portions - averaging around $15 or so per plate. 

I got some sort of quiche concoction ($11, in case you're curious), and my bf got the peach pancakes ($14). I also was amused that they brought us a little plate of crusty bread and jam to enjoy before our meal.

My only beef was the service. While very pleasant, it was so slow it began to seem like complete neglect. People started flowing out of the restaurant within 30 minutes of our arrival, so it's not that it was so busy in there that such slow service was justifiable. For $15 brunch plates, you'd think they'd fawn over their customers a tiny bit more. Maybe they only do that for dinner =P"}
{"text":"Very cool area to go out in Cleveland, and lots of great eating options to choose from, but If you are looking for quality food- flying fig is the place to be.  Yes, you will be paying for it because the food is expensive, but high quality.  Nice for a special occasion.   

As a vegetarian, I especially appreciated a diverse set of veggie options, and a generous wine list.  My husband and dad meat-eaters also enjoyed their meat options.  Menu is somewhat limited due to boutique nature of the restaurant, so if you are into substitution or customization of your food, this is probably not a place you would want to eat.

We ate on the front patio so enjoyed people watching and a nice Cleveland summer afternoon!  Pretty easy walk to Indians baseball game afterward (if you don't mind crossing that huge bridge)."}
{"text":"Hells yeah. This place is the shit.  Definitely my new favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Can't wait to go back on my next visit! 

Sweet lord is their food delicious.  The bacon/chorizo dates??? Come ON! And DO NOT skip dessert.  I had the chocolate molten cake.  I could have eaten about 5 of those guys.  

Plus, the Fig supports local farmers and Ohio food peeps.  You gotta love any establishment that supports local business. 

The decor is very warm and inviting.  There is a really cool room off on the side that is used for private parties.  And, the staff is all SUPER friendly."}
{"text":"Flying figs biscuit and gravy is one of the best things I have ever had my whole life. If I ever have a food network show I will definitely feature it. Probably not though."}
{"text":"Went to the Flying Fig this week. Food was amazing! Great happy hour. Had the pappardelle Bolognese which was fantastic.  I used the CLEseats app and got a free dessert!  Will definitely go back. In Ohio city which is a great location."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch on Sunday and was very impressed. Beautiful and busy outdoor patio area, great brunch cocktails, and delicious food. I had the Migas and loved it. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been twice now, once to meet up for after-dinner drinks and tonight I finally was able to come for full dinner. 

Location/ambience: Cool spot in the Market District, right across the street from Great Lakes Brewery. Great location and with a cute little patio out front for the nice days. Ambience at the bar/up front is nice, chill and with some cool booths to eat in the bar area. Back in the main part of the dining room though, it didn't seem like much attention was given to decor. Tables and chairs are basic-looking and old. My original chair was super wobbly and the carpet seemed like it could use a good cleaning, if not replacement. 

But on to what really matters, the food!
Tonight our group split two apps: flatbread and calamari. Both were tasty. The flatbread was basic, nothing particularly special about it. I like a very crispy thin crust when I think of flatbread - this one was a little too floppy in my book. Still tasty, just not 5 star good. Calamari had great flavor and I loved the sauce that came on the plate. The pepper garnish was a bit odd, but still good. Texture was perfect - not at all rubbery. 

All four of us tried different entrees: Polenta, Swordfish (special), seafood pasta, and I had the pork/chicken crepinettes. All of us were quite pleased with our meals and cleaned our plates. The crepinettes are basically like sausages which are pan-seared and very very good. The asparagus and mushroom risotto that came with them was also quite tasty. After a while of eating the risotto, it seemed like there was just a bit too much pepper for my tastes, but overall a very good dish. 

I feel the portion sizes here are perfect. Not too small so you'll leave hungry, but not so much that you can't eat it all without being very stuffed. Menu is small with more appetizer choices than entrees, but the dishes are very well done and there's something to please any palate.

Flying Fig is pretty solid in my book. There are places that are better at this price-point, I'd say, but overall a good option with a nice wine list, good cocktail menu and tasty food. I hear the brunch is fantastic so I'm looking forward to getting back at some point to try that out."}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch a couple times, and alway enjoy my visit! They have killer bloody marys, and unique brunch options. Please note that substitutions are not allowed on the menu! Except maybe if you have an allergy? The staff is friendly and service is always great. Parking is tough, but if you don't mind walking a few minutes, you can park in the lot by the market for free. Definitely make a reservation for weekend brunch, as it has always been packed. I look forward to going back now that I see brewnuts donuts are on their menu, yum!"}
{"text":"My first visit here. Interior is bigger than it looks from the outside. Paid lot across the street was full, so we walked over from WSM parking.

Love the fact that it's locally sourced. We started with the flatbread special, which was delicious--melted leeks with sausage and arugula. I enjoyed the goat cheese polenta with crisped pieces of speck on top and local vegetables. Finished with the  amazingly rich molten dark chocolate lava cake with fig ice cream--perfectly cooked, and the molten center was decadent! My friend thought the rhubarb crumble with autumn spices was the best dish of the evening. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places to be! Service quality is amazing and some of the best food in Cleveland! I highly recommend the Taleggio Polenta with the crispy egg.  The fig is very vegetarian friendly. Plus it's walking distance to most of the coolest hangouts in Ohio City."}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch is amazing. I dream of their huevos rancheros and Blood Mary's. Absolutely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Brunch was outstanding. We had the chive biscuits, non-traditional but tasty. Entrees were Tallegio polenta (creamy, rich, and decadent) and Croque Madam which was outstanding. Great toast, light bechamel, egg a tad underdone, and very good ham. Came with a side salad that cut the richness of the Croque. Servie was solid.

Great cocktails as well, peach bellini and trad mimosa."}
{"text":"Well I had high hopes for this place.  My waiter arrived and had an awesome man bun! In the end however I was left saying \"meh\".  The food was mediocre and overpriced and when I asked to sub things like breakfast potatoes instead of a salad that was meant to come with my breakfast (?!??) I was told the owner didn't believe in subbing and I would be up charged.  I wanted a bagel instead of toast and OF COURSE that was an up charge too.  

Most likely won't recommend and won't go back..."}
{"text":"Slow service and the server failed to mention the specials. 

Ordered the french toast with chicken thigh at brunch. The bourbon bacon jam and the chicken were both excellent. However, the bread of the french toast was so chewy and required a steak knife sawing through it to cut it up...."}
{"text":"the suburbanites might come and visit town hall for a questionable dinner, but the locals visit the fig. great happy hour, amazing brunch, and top notch farm-to-table food. karen small is one of the ohio city original great chefs, and although her name isn't as recognizable as some, she is worthy of praise. i recommend fresh squeezed orange juice and pancakes on the weekend and the happy hour $5 burger during the week."}
{"text":"Definitely a solid 4 1/2 stars... My husband and I are huge fans of farm to table fare so when we read the reviews of Flying Fig, we had to check it out. We started with the Gnocchi which was amazing -  creamy, tender, complex flavors without being overpowering. My husband had the hangar steak special which he loved... the steak was tender and juicy, the accompanying root vegetable au gratin and green beans were delicious. I had the fish and chips which was spectacular... peanut panko breaded cod served with red cabbage slaw and polenta fries. The polenta fries are ridiculously good. The quality of the ingredients, presentation of the dishes, service and ambiance are all excellent."}
{"text":"I died and went to biscuit and gravy heaven. Scratch that, brunch heaven.  I need to go back daily until I try every last thing on their menu.  The biscuits and gravy had large chunks of delicious sausage.  The best part--- they made tasty homemade biscuit sandwiches with the sausage and biscuits- it was both adorable and tasty.  Much better than the typical giant biscuits swimming in over peppered, dense gravy.  My best friend got the polenta, which was very tasty, and a bit lighter.  They don't have giant portions-so you don't feel like you need to leave on a stretcher.  Mimosa was tasty, service was great, atmosphere was pretty decent too.  Do yourself a favor and eat here."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Cleveland.  Hands down.  Impeccable food, good service, small, independent and funky.  Great for dates or smaller groups as well.  Perfect portion sizes.  I just love it here at the fig!"}
{"text":"Quick recap:

Ordered the much talked about tempura green beans.  Just ok.  Probably not worth the fried calories.

Ordered the seared Duck Breast with leg confit.  The leg was incredibly tasty and properly seasoned.  The breast (the main portion of the dish), resting on the pumpkin puree, was entirely forgettable and fairly bland (I had to ask for salt).  I expect more for $26.  

My mother ordered the polenta and was only marginally pleased.

The kicker was (and perhaps there could be some argument on this one) I started out ordering a glass of wine ~ the Fidelity Merlot ~ and once it arrived was so offput (by one sip) by the incredibly chalky, earthy, dirty taste of it, I (after saying I NEVER do this) sent it back and asked her recommendation for a replacement that was lighter, etc.  I ended up with the pinot noir that was decent and drinkable.  BUT she charged me for both glasses.  REALLY?!?!?!?   I suppose the restaurant was within their fair rights to do that, but it made me incredibly unhappy as a customer.  I paid the full bill, but left knowing that I will NOT recommend the restaurant, based on that poor service element and the marginally pleasing food, and will certainly not return myself.

Hope the management reads this and realizes how unhappy this made me as a customer."}
{"text":"Stylish interior.  Nice bartenders. Expensive, but good drinks.  Expensive food that is just alright.  Hostess and wait staff were snippy."}
{"text":"Second time to the flying fog! Really like the place, prices are pretty good. It's a nice brunch spot to throw into the mix every now and again!"}
{"text":"Before I give  my review I must point out that I have Celiac's Disease and I'm restricted to a Gluten Free diet.  Therefore my reviews always factor in how a restaurant accommodates my diet.  Four of us had brunch at the Flying Fig, Sunday August 21st.  We all got the Migas w/ Chorizo.  The food was very good, however for the price the portions could have been larger.  My 3-star rating is due to my drink order experience.  I ordered a Bloody Mary and asked the server to check if the Worcestershire Sauce used was Gluten Free.  She went to check, came back and informed me that the BM batch was made the previous evening and she wasn't sure if the Worcestershire Sauce was Gluten Free.  Wasn't sure?  Doesn't a restaurant know what products they use?  I would give this restaurant another try, maybe for dinner"}
{"text":"En route to Los Angeles from upstate New York, the Flying Fig was our first stop for food. Even though the atmosphere and food could call for a more pretentious attitude regarding attire, they welcomed us warmly in our driving clothes.

Our server was very friendly and knowledgable, giving us ample time to choose from the menu while maintaining contact and not disappearing.

It was very difficult to decide what to have for dinner. Everything sounds good.

We started with a special appitizer of the day, an asparagus-bacon quiche. Unlike a typical quiche, this was fluffy, light, and full of flavor.

Next, my fiancé had 3 small plates: gnocci with rabbit, chorizo stuffed dates, and a crispy polenta cake. I had a pasta special of penne with smoked chicken and kale in pesto. Normally, we're fast eaters, but Flying Fig had us Oohing and Aahing at every bite, trying desperately to make it last.

It did not, and we were tempted to lick our plates. Luckily, our lovely server reminded us of dessert.

He ordered the chocolate lava cake with fig ice cream while I ordered the rhubarb cake with strawberry ice cream. Amazing.

And we left with enough energy to make it to Indiana that night."}
{"text":"Simply outstanding. 

From the warm friendly greeting of Tony Mellon.. to the excellent cozy table we were seated at ..the atmosphere at Flying Fig was welcoming and first class from the moment we entered.  

Our server Eric was friendly and informed. He showed us just the right amount of attention, and sensed instinctively when space was required. He was knowledgeable about the dishes and guided us towards the perfect dinner selections. 

Both of our meals were absolutely beyond perfect. The presentation was artful. We were perfectly satisfied ..and enjoyed every moment of our meal. 

Flying Fig is Devine. A master class in fine dining at it's best."}
{"text":"Had the ohio burger, one of the best burgers ever!!! Definitely will be back. My husband had the polenta and that was super good as well."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a couple of friends on Saturday around noon. I guess it was pretty busy but the food took almost half an hour to come out, we were waiting for quite a while. I got the soup of the day- cream of asparagus and biscuit with jam and butter, which were very tasty. The soup was very creamy and flavorful. The biscuit was very soft on the inside and fluffy and yummy."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite spots in Ohio City. 

I love the fact that it's kind of hidden away from the main road (West 25th) and it looks so tiny from the outside....till you walk inside and you are blown away by the actual size of the restaurant and the decor. Dimly lit, perfect for romantic dinners or just a night out for some good food. 

I had made reservations through Open Table for a friend and myself for 8pm on a Friday evening and we were seated right upon arrival. Our server was very informed with the specials offered that evening and was great at recommending drinks and appetizers. We both had a drink (I had a glass of wine and she had a mixed drink) which we both really enjoyed. 

We ended up just sharing two appetizers for dinner: Crispy Calamari & Wild Shrimp which was accompanied by Chiles, Scallions, Pickled Carrots, Arugula, Lemon Aioli...in my opinion it was amazing! One of my favorite dishes I've had in a long time. And the other dish was Ancho Crusted Pan Seared Sea Scallop which was made with Corn Grit Cakes, Braised Local Kale, Ancho-Honey reduction...it was ok. We weren't thrilled by it but it wasn't terrible. The only recommendation I would have is to provide customers with two pieces of scallops not just one since we wanted to share it. 

I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a relaxing but nice night out."}
{"text":"Walked in and was seated. The server brought us some water and never saw him again. Sat for an additional ten minutes before leaving because it was busy. Very disappointing because the menu looked great."}
{"text":"We were completing the Puzzle by the Glasses bar crawl and the first stop was Market Wine Bar but it was closed so we stopped next for at Flying Fig for a snack to get us started! It was such a nice little place! I was really happy with everything. There were a few bartenders on, all super nice! All the food dishes around us looked great and I regret not ordering a Mimosa, it looked so good. My boyfriend ordered the turkey sandwich which he loved and it came with housemade chips which were super good and I am not a big chip person! I ordered the mushroom melt which was also good. Both sandwiches are so big we only ate half each and packed the other half for lunch today! 
They had a pretty good wine and beer selection, nothing too crazy but a nice variety. But really the atmosphere and bartender were just great, it was a relaxing start to a Sunday Funday and I would definitely suggest brunch there which is way more affordable than we expected for a such a nice little place in Ohio City."}
{"text":"Recently, I dined at Flying Fig again and this time, I wasn't quite as satisfied. First, the menu was limited, so that was a little disappointing. Then, I noticed the prices were pretty high, especially for a hamburger. The hamburger is $22 and you're not allowed to change the dish in any way from how the chef serves it. That's the most expensive hamburger I've ever seen in my life. I wonder how many of them they serve. If they knocked $10 off the price of the burger, I might have ordered it. Their prices say to me, \"Don't ever eat here again\". But the place was full! They do offer gluten free options, however.

My braised pork rib was moist, tender, and very tasty. The potatoes were also very good. There was a lot of BBQ sauce on the short ribs, probably too much. It was served with a slaw over top. Our server was fast and friendly. Everything was good, besides the price.

Maybe we should try breakfast here sometime."}
{"text":"We love this place for brunch. The menu is full of interesting selections you won't find anywhere else. It kinda upscale but worth the extra $20 you'll spend for a meal and a couple drinks there. It's right across the street from Great Lakes Brewery and a great place if you're looking for an eclectic meal."}
{"text":"I've only been to Flying Fig twice -- both times for brunch. So while I can't comment on lunch or dinner, let's talk breakfast. I wasn't feeling a heavy breakfast after a night of eating plenty of junk at the Best of Cleveland party. So, the least meat-y and heavy option looked like the Scrambled Eggs. I wouldn't usually order scrambled eggs at a restaurant because it's one of the few things I feel like I can make as well at home. But I had a feeling I was in for a treat because everything here is a little special.

The eggs were slightly scrambled, and piled atop each other in a big sphere, like the top of a sloppy ice cream cone. Layered in the scramble were chives and gruyere, which gave them good flavor, but nothing that knocked me off my feet. The toast it came with was more of a crunchy bread, slightly and intentionally burned along the edges. Still good when you add butter. And it came with a wonderful, light side salad with a little cheese and light dressing. Surprisingly good combination. I tested a bite of the biscuits and gravy, and it was incredible.

It was enjoyable, but not spectacular. The service was very attentive, but not exactly friendly. I'd definitely go back, and I'm interested in trying other meals next time."}
{"text":"I've had flying fig in my bookmarks for some time now but never made it there until recently found myself near by and was able to try it. Service was really really good, the server was personable, attentive and nice. The flat bread with egg and ham was tasty and I would get it again, you should definitely try it. Otherwise I felt the menu was small with a small selection of choices. I also had their brussel sprouts and eggplant polenta and ehhh not too impressed. I would go back to try their brunch but not so much for dinner. Maybe get the flat bread to go."}
{"text":"A group of us participated on the Cleveland Bike Tour for a friend's birthday and stopped at this place for a drink. The bartender was extremely rude and condescending just because we were a large group of people celebrating a birthday. One person in our group attempted to get his attention and he blatantly ignored her, when she did get his attention she asked what she should get and he says \"nothing because your eyes are cross-eyed\". We also attempted to order shots and he just kept saying how he didn't have the types we were asking for. When we asked him for suggestions, he answers \"well I have a classic bar so I have no sweet stuff or mixers\". We were not a rowdy group but he treated us as if we were bothering him. We chose to go to this bar instead of Great Lakes because it was busy and that was the biggest mistake ever. The place was dead and they should have appreciated the business, but instead they drastically lost a lot of money with the attitude. Never again."}
{"text":"This review is of Flying Fig's happy hour. I went on a Thursday evening after work with a 5:15pm reservation. There was no hostess around to greet me so I wandered into the restaurant. One of the servers helped me sort things out but it certainly wasn't the smoothest start. 

Once seated, we were informed that the servers were meeting with the chef and wouldn't be available for a bit. Kind of odd to do this when happy hour should have already been in full swing but perhaps they were just running behind schedule. The booth we were in was near the bar and was pretty small - treading the thin line between cozy and uncomfortable. Nevertheless, the nachos and chicken tacos were good and the overall atmosphere was nice. I'd recommend for happy hour and will update this review if I try them out for dinner."}
{"text":"Driving through Cleveland and stopped to eat. Picked this restaurant as it had great reviews. Was surprised to see that the burger description had a \"no deletions or substitutions clause\"...while I appreciated the no substitutions rule, wasting so much food I didn't want was obscene for me. I wanted a bunless simple gourmet burger. We're Chicagoans and pay a premium for good food, but 22.00 was a bit much as well.
The burger itself was very good though and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"The Flying Fig is one of the best restaurants in Cleveland!  Their food is amazing, their service is great, and they have one of the best happy hours in Cleveburgh.  

Their menu makes great use of local ingredients, and it changes seasonally, although it often has the same types of dishes on it, just with seasonal flair.  I always love the duck confit, they have a great burger (although nothing beats Lolita's burger) and a number of fantastic other dishes.  

Their happy hour is amazing, but you have to get there relatively early to get a spot because it's only in the bar/lounge area.  

Favorite dishes here are: the dates wrapped in bacon, the warm olives, the mussels, the beet salad, ricotta gnocchi, duck confit, lamb chop, and the chicken.  For dessert, you can't beat the chocolate cake with house-made fig gelato.

They have had a great brunch on Sundays for a long time, and they just started offering brunch on Saturdays!  Woo hoo!  They change up their brunch menu, but it's really the best option for brunch in that area.  

This place is busy on weekends, but I'm always curious about why it never seems to be full on evenings during the week.  

This is a great place to take out-of-town guests to impress them about how great this city is.  

Overall, the Flying Fig is one of the best restaurants in the city.  Karen Small, keep up the good work, please!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot with amazing food! Local, fun and creative menu with a really nice drink list to go with it. I sat at the bar and got great service and will be back again to try the rest. Can't go wrong with anything I saw coming out of the kitchen. Great job!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great brunch! There is a lot of variety on the menu, including both brunch classics like biscuits & gravy, but also some more creative plates like corn & andouille hotcakes. I ordered one of their specials, which was a breakfast sandwich on a cheddar & chive biscuit with breakfast potatoes. The biscuit was a bit dry, but the apple butter on the sandwich was delicious! My friend ordered another special, the pumpkin pancakes, and they were incredible! So fluffy! The service was also very good. For a party of 6, on a Saturday morning, our waiter was super attentive. 

So, why the 4 stars? In my opinion, it was a bit pricey for what we ordered. Also, I was a bit disappointed in the drink options. I ordered an orange juice, which was not fresh pressed. Not trying to be a food snob or anything, but I expected an upscale foodie brunch place like the Flying Fig to have fresh orange juice with their brunch and more options for coffee than just House and Decaf. This is Ohio City! Where's the latte at?"}
{"text":"This was a very solid experience. I ordered the loaded potatoes and a side salad - both were very good! Also the staff were nice and accommodating. I would have given it five stars, but the menu was a challenge for me. I couldn't avoid starches, carbs, and cheese. In this case, though, it was worth it not to."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now for brunch. The food is amazing. I really enjoy it. I always get the scrambled eggs. Something so simple, yet simply amazing. The coffee is also delicious. Hats off to the chef. I love the ambience. 

The only negative thing, which will keep me away, is the service. I walked into the restaurant today and the hostess was on the phone. That's fine. But I was standing there awkwardly for almost 5 minutes, she doesn't even acknowledge me or say \"I'll be with you in a sec.\" It was like I was made of air.

Our waitress seemed very sad. No smile. She said the \"specials are on the board\" with a blank expression. She took our order without any expression change. We asked for more cream for coffee, then I realized I wanted some ketchup for my eggs, and asked her. She said \"what else do you want?\" in a pissed off tone. She brought it back and threw it on the table. We had also had salt which she knocked over with that ketchup fun, creating a mess of the table; she brushed it all off the table with her hands onto the floor (!?)  it seemed like we were really bothering her.... a part of me was like \"but isn't that your job.... to like bring us stuff...?\"

 I felt bad, maybe someone yelled at her or something; but still no need to spread the negativity to other people trying to enjoy a nice Saturday brunch...? It made me appreciate other places that had nice service."}
{"text":"Food was okay.  Service was awful.  Server messed up my friends order and didn't offer to fix it, discount it or comp it.  Also, after being told my friend was allergic to eggs brought bread to the table that we discovered was made with EGGS after we inquired... ?!?!?!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! We had the huevos rancheros (so good) and the croques madame. The croques madame was great too but I'd get the huevos next time. The potatoes with pork belly are also rockin. We didn't have any cocktails but the cocktail menu looked great."}
{"text":"This is our second visit here. Second time is the charm.  Had a table for 7 with the two grandsons. This is a true test of dining. Appetizers, salads and then the hamburger for the boys. Adults loved the short ribs and hanger steak and lamb. 
Staff was attentative, grandsons were well behaved and we all left happy !"}
{"text":"We came here for a late brunch after a three mile run in edgewater park. The Southern Benedict was awesome, it was what I want after my run!"}
{"text":"If you like overpriced, mediocre food served by snotty unprofessional staff who treat you like you are bothering them by eating at their restaurant, than this is the place for you!

I was looking forward to a special lunch after visiting the Rock and Roll of Fame and wanted to go to the brew pub across the street, but there was a 60 minute wait...

I had read good things, but was sadly disappointed.

The menu offered a lot of brunch items as well as a few sandwiches, salads and burgers.

I ended up getting the cobb salad without egg. It consisted of an average amount of spring greens, a few oven roasted tomatoes, chicken, a half piece of bacon crumbled and hardly any blue cheese. It was supposed to have a vinagarette on the salad, but I really couldn't taste any.  I know salads aren't the most exciting things to eat, but this could have been much, much better.

The thing that really put a bad taste in my mouth was the service. It was deplorable.


I'm not sure who the woman was who brought me a glass of water, but I really apologize for doing something to tick you off. It was clear you were unhappy by the fact you slammed the glass down on the table and spilled water all over my purse. No apologizes offered.

The waiter took my order and never came back except for when I asked for my bill.  When he brought it there was no \"thanks for coming in\", \"thanks for visiting\" or \"have a  nice day\". It was just \"here you go\".

There are a lot of great restaurants in Cleveland. I would not recommend this one, at all."}
{"text":"You know it's love when the one who seduced you makes you brunch.  Oh Figgy, darling, you made me fall in love with you all over again.  It's not the sultry but playful scene from the night before.  It's relaxed and requited.

I brought my 6 year old and Mon cher chou to brunch.  Herself Who Would Not Be Pleased was just aching to brood about something.  Then she got the whole wheat pancakes with apples and bacon in front of her.  Then Herself transformed into Queen Sunshine of Baconland.  Good bacon does that to her.

Mon cher chou and I started out with cocktails.  I had the grapefruit, which was freshly squeezed juice and a blend of booze, darling.    It was bright, pert and refreshing.  Mon cher chou's orange cocktail was heavy on the Stoli orange and a bit light on the juice.  This might not be a bad thing.

I had the fried polenta with a saute of spinach, muchrooms and pancetta.  The polenta was crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside.  The saute was cooked with a light hand and added a fresh counterpoint to the heavy polenta.  Mon cher chou had a decadent, moist, creamy marscapone french toast.  It was almost custard-like.  Mercy.

The sweet bread (not sweetbread!) basket was a bit small for the cost, but the baked goods were divine-- pound cake, zucchini bread, a muffin, all homemade.

The atmosphere is relaxed, easy and accomodating of children, although they do not have an awful dumbed down menu for them.  Every child would like the pancakes, sweet breads or french toast.  

It seems that they are still working out a few kinks in the service-- our orders were put through twice.  But there was nothing that inconveninced us.  The staff was their usual cool, friendly selves.

So, FF, you took me in, you spun me around and now you made me breakfast.  I think this is it."}
{"text":"The wife and I recently visited Flying Fig for a late evening dinner after a long day of digging out from the previous nights blizzard.  I was pretty surprised to find that the place was mostly empty at 10PM on a Friday, but I guess a lot of that can be chalked up the weather and a metric tonne of things going on in town that evening.

The sparsely populated dining room and bar were actually a welcome sight, having just come from a fun, but over-crowded gathering, and after we made ourselves comfortable in our booth we got down to the business of trying to decide what to order.  

I suppose that to say I've heard great things about Flying Fig is an understatement, and for certain friends, it has been their favorite restaurant in town for years.  Finally having a chance to take it all in in person proved they at least had a very solid argument.  

I ended up ordering the lamb shank, and the wife ordered the burger and when they arrived I'm pretty sure our eyes popped out of our heads.  My lamb shank looked as if it might have been a prop from the Flintstones, and my wife's burger looked mouth-wateringly good (as did the accompanying mound of fries and onion rings).  Both dishes tasted even better than they looked and it wasn't long before they had disappeared completely.

The service was friendly and efficient.  As I said earlier, it seemed as if we might have hit on a relatively dead night, but I feel confident we would have received the same treatment had we come at a busier time.  

In my opinion, Flying Fig has earned every word of praise I've heard about it, and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"While the ambience is good and it's definitely a nice place to visit, it definitely does not qualify to be listed as \"Vegetarian\" - there were hardly a couple of vegetarian / vegan items on the Menu that we could order. 

Food was OK. Not worth the price.

Tea collection was great! Loved the way they allow you to smell each option in little boxes before you pick the one you like.

Ice wine options were excellent!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Stopped in for a quick drink this week, and realized it had been way too long since my last meal here, which will definitely be rectified asap. I had the $5 signature happy hour cocktail: the Paloma. It was pretty spectacular! 

I look forward to trying the beet burger at happy hour!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with some friends. Ambiance was trendy and the dress was casual. 

Confused on where main entrance was but realized it was the same as the market entrance.

We came here for the happy hour menu and it didnt disappoint. The portion size was bigger than my group expected so that was a good thing. I ordered the chicken tacos and the flatbread and I was not disappointed. The tacos were pretty tasty in my opinion but my friends said the nachos were better. The flatbread was a good but my jaw was aching by the time I finished it. But despite that, I enjoyed it. 

Also had the highball drink of the day. It had grapefruit juice, vodka, ginger beer, and some other stuff that I can't really remember. The drink was good but I couldn't taste the alcohol at all. It was pretty much juice but for $5, it wasn't bad.

The staff was super friendly and nice. Only reason I gave it a 4 star was because the food took a while to come out"}
{"text":"Typically when I am in this area I head to GLBC, but the crowd there today inspired me to try something new. Wasn't let down. The Flying Fig had good food, good service, and a large enough selection of beers to find something delicious."}
{"text":"Flying Fig was very close to being empty on a Saturday night.  Which makes me so sad because it's such a cute place and I'm pretty sure it was the best meal I've had in a really long time!

Everything about our meal was perfect - the drinks came quickly and were really great. Anyone who knows how to properly mix St. Germain gets points with me!  Our appetizers were fresh and delicious - the dates (of course!) and a very summery fried squash.

But I've come to Flying Fig other times and left slightly disappointed in my entrees and wished I had only ordered small plates.  Well, not this time.  I had a beef cheek rigatoni that was out-of-this-world good.  I was too busy devouring my rigatoni to even ask how the husband's hangar steak was, and by the time I'd looked up to ask if I could try it, it was gone.  I guess he really liked his, too.

We ordered an apple dessert (I hate apple desserts, I just wanted the ice cream!) and mannnn, was it good ice cream. I wanted to buy it by the gallon and keep it in my freezer at all times.  And I don't normally get that excited over vanilla.

Overall, it was a perfect (but definitely pricey) meal and I hope the next time I go back it is just as lovely and delicious."}
{"text":"Solid brunch options with heavy meat options, I could devour these plates."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the city. My first time here was a few years back with my mother for some sort of occasion. I have been back for happy hour and brunch a few times. If you get drunk at brunch is that \"brunk\"? The brunch is probably my favorite more fancy brunch in the city. I have not had a bad experience yet. I would reserve coming here for special celebrations because some of the items are pricey. If you can afford eating here often, shoot me a message. I can be a lot of fun to talk to and hang out with."}
{"text":"Zuni or no Zuni, this was one of the best places I've eaten anywhere!  Wow!  Actually I never made it to Zuni's when I lived in the Bay Area, my friend said the food at Zuni's is OK but mainly that it is a really fun place to hang.

Anyway, we are talking about the Flying Fig now.  This place is across the street from Great Lakes Brewing Co.

First of all, you have a choice of happy hour food and prices or dinner.  We went for the main dining area.

We thought the martinis were pricey at $9 but one is the size of 2.  We started with the calamari with a pickled ginger aioli. There was some daikon slaw scattered over it which complemented it fabulously.  It was a huge, crispy, perfectly fried not greasy plate for only $8 and was the best calamari we had ever eaten in our lives. We were full after that but we HAD to eat all of it.

I had one of the little plates of toasted walnut bread, figs, Maytag blue cheese, balsamic reduction.  The blue cheese was phenomenal, however, it was a very small portion for $8.  I wanted to try dessert so I just had roasted beet salad ($8).  I cannot describe what mysteriously delectable things were in there,  It was so good.

My mother in law had duck breast ($23) and leg with a sour cherry reduction.  Ordered medium rare, the breast was the most succulent we had ever eaten in our lives.  It came with some carmelized onions, greens, and a butternut squash puree to die for.  The puree was extremely rich and lovely and out of the ordinary.  The only downside was that the duck leg turned out a little dry and not so crispy.  It seemed it had been reheated.  Still, it was very tastey.

Dessert was another \"best we've ever had.\"  Mascarpone cheesecake on shortbread crust with fig compote.  It was the best cheesecake ever.  Oh my god.  Dessert was a steal at $6.

After dessert, I FINALLY realized that the restaurant was aptly named, featuring a liberal use of fresh delicious figs.  HAHA!!!!

We went on a somewhat gray and rainy Friday.  There was a gentleman there by himself with a paper.  It seemed he ate there every night for dinner or something.  If I had the money and lived close by, I would definitely do the same.

I am sure the happy hour bar food (hamburgers, etc) is the best bar food ever.  But if you're going to go for the first time, eat in the dining room for god's sake and get dessert too!"}
{"text":"I loved my most recent visit to the Flying Fig..  It has been about 3 years since i was last here, and i wanted to see if it was everything I'd remembered it being..  I'm happy to say it was.. 

I wandered over late from the wine bar next door on a Sunday and got settled in for a light dinner..  I split a bottle of wine and 6 tapas plates with my friend and remembered why I tried to eat here every month when I was working in Cleveland over the course of 8 months.. 

As with my prior visits, the food was sublime and superlative at the same time..  little surprises awaited in every bite..  As mentioned by other reviewers, the bacon wrapped dates are wonderful, but other small dishes such as the gnocchi with rabbit and wild mushrooms, or the crispy polenta with tomato-fennel-mascarpone sauce blew me away with the creativity of the flavour parings and attention to detail..  I find it hard to find fault any time I've been here..

The service was perfect to a note..  warm without being overly familiar and professional without being overly stiff..  He was knowledgeable and attentive while giving us plenty of room to have a quiet dinner..  He could give lessons to servers in more formal restaurants twice the price..    

All in all 5 stars..  I hope to return soon.."}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I celebrated our 8th anniversary at the Fig.  I will try to keep this succinct.

The scallop appetizer: 4/5.  The spices were strong, but very delicious with a honey base.  If you like the natural light flavor of scallops, you may not care for this.  Small serving of two scallops.

Medjook dates appetizer: 5/5.  Incredible, but tiny serving.  3 dates.

Fish special dinner: 5/5.  Great risotto, fish, etc.  Good sized entree.

Hangar steak dinner: 4.5/5.  The cut was a TAD chewy, if I am going to be very picky, but I ate every bite and enjoyed it.  At $24, I feel it was a fair price for the size and quality (big cut) I received.

Apple cobbler dessert: 1/5.  It was moderately covered in sea salt.  While I can appreciate the combination of sweet and salty that is the fad these days, the salt was overpowering on this dessert.  Perhaps if it was lightly salted, but this was more than a dash.  It was the only \"miss\" of the night.

Molten chocolate cake with fig ice cream dessert: 5/5.  If you love molten chocolate, you'll like this, and the house specialty fig ice cream is awesome.  Portion size is small, this is probably not a dessert to split.

Ambiance including dining room, patio, and restrooms: 3/5.  It was OK, but considering the prices should have been one step up in \"class\".  For example, stall walls in men's room had a little graffiti on them.  Dial antibacterial soap in its plastic grocery store jug.  We ate inside, the patio tables and chairs didn't look overly appealing/comfortable.

The two of us left out the door at about $120 including 20% tip.

I struggled, 4 stars or 5?  Overall it deserves 4.5 stars.  We'll be back - the food was amazing enough to cover for the minor misses in other areas.

5/15/13: I came back to this review after really thinking it through more carefully, and after hitting up a bunch of restaurants while on vacation in comparison.  I still feel the FF is an excellent restaurant but I just can't justify 5 stars.  It's a solid 4 star experience -- if they can improve the tiny app portion sizes, take the decor slightly upscale, and perhaps tweak that apple cobbler I'd give the star back.  (Or leave the apps tiny, but make them $5-6 instead of $9-10.  It's just not acceptable that one person would need to buy two apps for about $20 to get that 'slightly satisfied' feeling that an appetizer is supposed to bring.)"}
{"text":"I have to first of all state that any criticism that I write here is purely nit picking and that you should refer back to the 5 star rating!  After all how interesting is it to read that our server was friendly and timely because she was or that the food was delicious because it was.

The dimly lit dining room and world beat music playing so loud it's like another person sitting at the table let you know that you were definitely in one of Cleveland's trendy restaurants.  Feeling very much in the mood I ordered the Chicken Confit with hericot vert and spaetzle, this isn't your mother's chicken and dumplings!  The chicken was moist, fantastic and falling off the bone but slightly salty.  The hericot vert or as they were called in my house growing up, green beans, had a crunch and wonderful flavor.  The spaezle was the perfect complement to it all and helped balance the saltiness of the chicken.

The dinner was capped off with bread pudding that wasn't too sweet and a smear of carmel that was just sweet enough.

The best recommendation I can give the Flying Fig is would I bring out of town guest to show off Cleveland's foodie community and the answer is a resounding, YES!"}
{"text":"This place is across the river from downtown, located in Ohio City right across the street from Great Lakes Brewery.  Came here for Saturday brunch, and were not disappointed.  I got the biscuits and gravy, and the portion size was perfect.   It came with mini-biscuits, which I thoroughly enjoyed, along with the delicious taste.

The level of customer service was also phenomenal.  Someone in our party asked for some cranberry juice, and upon the staff realizing they were out of cranberry juice, instead of telling us they were out of stock, they actually went out to the store and bought cranberry juice just for them.  Above and beyond!

Definitely check this place out if you're looking for good brunch in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is my favorite place for brunch in Cleveland. They serve local, fresh ingredients with great portion sizes. So local and fresh that after going to a farmers market across the street, the products were being served at the restaurant hours later. 

I have had most of the menu here and I love it all, but if there is one item I would suggest it would be the sticky buns. They are melt in your mouth perfect and I sometimes drive to Ohio City on a Sunday morning only for the sticky buns. 

If you're looking for a good place to take a friend for a Cleveland brunch that is embracing the farm to table movement, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Fun place to go when I was in Cleveland visiting my parents. This restaurant has a very tastey menu including seasonal options, which are all spectacular. The atmosphere is very chill and relaxing.  This is a well known place by many younger people that live in Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately no longer on Open Table ;( but still the best brunch in town in my book. And still always busy so clearly they don't need Open Table's help. Though to make a reservation you now actually have to speak into your smartphone (soon to be watch): 216-241-4243. 

I haven't written a review since the Brunch menu changed. My favourite Migas dish is no more, but it has been replaced by a new favourite - Shaksuka. Something that I've never heard of before, but have now had twice and love. It's so simple, yet so flavourful and always consistently good. 

The menu calls it spicy, but I'd disagree and just say well flavoured; it's not \"hot\" - maybe even a little sweet from the peppers and tomatoes. If you order it definitely add the lamb sausage. You get one links worth, about half the plate in size. It really makes the dish and adds substance to it - not optional in my opinion. 

Just like I was on the Migas I am hooked on this dish. Soon I will have to try something else as the rest of the weekend (still both Sat & Sund 1100-1500) brunch menu looks great! The sticky buns and apple butter sure are."}
{"text":"Good food... Susan our server was very good and personable!! Lovely patio ...
We will be back.. 4 stars due to long wait for food to arrive"}
{"text":"Started with bacon wrapped fig then the special hanger steak. Perfectly cooked, wonderful service. Amazing local place. Found this place by accident and so grateful for it!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Everything was fresh and unique. I wish the date appetizer was just slightly bigger, I think it only consists of 4 dates and the mussels were amazing. The drinks were wonderful as well, and I normally don't drink whiskey. It would be nice to see some specialty cocktails that aren't whiskey based, but it goes well with the overall vibe of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Farm to table concept restaurant. Lots of hits and misses. Short rib was fine but too fatty. Bit pricey for what it was in terms of portion too. Don't remember what other dishes we ordered - that should tell ya."}
{"text":"When we were greeted (sorta ...) by the brusque guy at the door who seemed to be bothered that we were there early last Sunday evening we were thinking going to this place was a mistake.  We were thinking \"no wonder this place is empty -- they don't WANT customers here!\"
We took a seat at the bar and were greeted by a barkeep with a great personality.  Very pleasant fellow!  
We had the pork nacho thingies (minimalist but very creative) and mussels (we ordered the ones slightly greater in cost with the chorizo).  The nachos were OK and the mussels were OK also, but one had to use one's imagination to taste the sausage.  The broth was quite excellent.
We had house vino -- red and while -- both were quiet excellent for house wines and were very fairly priced. 
We'd give the place a \"3\" if it were not for the excellent service at the bar.  A \"4\" is really a bit generous.  One does not have to go into the bowels of the \"dirty city\" to find a \"3\" or \"4\"  restaurant at which to eat.  So, why bother?
The owner really needs to get rid of the rude slob employee who hangs out at the door."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the staff is great!  Definitely recommend it and it's in a great area where you can go over to any of the bars after and make it a fun date night or just a night out with the girls"}
{"text":"Went here for weekend brunch and again for a weekday happy hour. Brunch food was all great. But it filled up within 10 minutes of opening. So I would highly recommend reservations. Happy hour was equally good. 1/2 price bottles of wine on Wednesdays, great bartender, yummy food. I highly recommend the goat cheese toast. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"The food was great!  We had the mixed green salad, which had an excellent light vinagrette on it.  We ordered the hanger steak and lamb loin.  Both were cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly.  The meat was very tender and the vegetable sides were delicious!  Highly recommend the brussel sprouts!  It seemed odd that they wouldn't allow us to substitute sides in the dish, but everything was still very good.  The server was the worst part of the evening.  We ordered a bottle of wine that never came after we sat there waiting for almost 20 minutes.  Then a manager noticed that we were sitting there for a long time and asked if we wanted something to drink.  We let her know that we ordered a bottle of wine already that never came, and she came back immediately with the bottle and said that they would not charge us for it.  The server finally returned back several minutes later with the bottle of wine and was shocked that we already had it.  He was not attentive throughout the evening.  It seemed as if we were his only table in this section of the restuarant, as we barely saw him.  When the bill came, it even had the wine billed on there.  When we brought this to his attention that we were told that the wine would be comped, his looked at us funny and went to look into it.  Nonetheless, he did return to say that the manager was not there anymore, but he went ahead and took it off the bill.  They are definitely lacking communication between the staff here.  I would still go back for the good food and hope for another server..."}
{"text":"After a particularly busy week where all we did was cook in, we were ready to take our taste buds out on a date. Not wanting to enter a bar scene - where the noise level and characters make us want to turn right around and crawl back into our cave of homemade suppers - we chose the Flying Fig because the seasonal menu never seems to disappoint and the atmosphere is classy and calm. We've always requested a table, but on this particular Saturday night we decided to host an intimate affair at the bar where the full menu is always served. The staff was friendly and attentive and our entrees hit the spot. Try the Taleggio Polenta and tell me you're in love with the crispy egg on top, too."}
{"text":"The food is just ok, and the waitress messed my order. I would not come back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Flying Fig for several years, but never thought to leave a review. The staff is awesome, and the food/drinks are always top notch. I'd highly recommend stopping in. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Be sure to ask about the toast of the day. So much fun and such a unique appetizer! Service is great and ambiance is wonderful. Perfect for a special evening out in Ohio City."}
{"text":"Overall my experience here was nothing special. The place tries hard but falls short. The service was attentive, I'll give them that, but i didn't really enjoy the food, especially for the prices they were charging.

Flying Fig has a lot of the same menu items as other popular eateries in Cleveland (i.e. Lolita, Greenhouse Tavern), but the execution just wasn't there:

Steamed Mussels - very fishy and weird tasting. Somehow the balance of the ingredients was off, and the chorizo didn't really seem to go well with the mussels. We left most of this untouched (But the same exact dish with chorizo and mussels at Lolita is pretty amazing. You need to go try it if you haven't)

Buratta Cheese - Can't really mess up putting cheese on a plate. The burratta they had was good, and while I'm not a fan of olives, the rest of my party seemed to have enjoyed the olive tapenade. One thing though, I'm pretty sure burratta is spelled with two r's...not sure why they only put one on the menu...

Ancho Crusted Pan Seared Sea Scallop - This was $10 for ONE scallop. The scallop wasn't THAT big either. Flavor wasn't bad, but not worth it at all.

Cornmeal Crusted Chicken Livers - not bad if you like chicken livers. I don't usually eat livers, but tried some and didn't hate it, so interpret that how you will...

Local Beet - unfortunately the beets were pickled, which made them too artificially sweet/sour. Why mess up perfectly good fresh beets? Should have just served them straight up.

Herbed Ricotta Gnocchi - Gnocchi's are potato pasta dumplings. These were rolled up wads of dough with nothing inside (at least I didn't taste any). Too oily and didn't taste like much. SKIP!

Hangar Steak- Well cooked and tender even at medium. Solid choice.

Chicken Meatballs - This was good. I feel weird ordering meatballs as a fancy $20 entree, but I guess at least it was tasty. Worth the money? Probably not.

May we just came on an off day, but based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend coming here for dinner. It seemed like some of the other patrons had travelzoo deals. If you can locate some sort of discount, this may not be a bad place to take a date (just don't bust out your deal on a first date). If you're planning to pay full price though, I'd go somewhere else."}
{"text":"What a great experience. I wish I could give the Flying Fig 6 stars for their food, ambiance and friendly staff. I wasn't particularly hungry when arriving but after smelling the freshly baked bread and breakfast items, my stomach instantly growled.

Deciding on what items to order was difficult, as everything on the menu looked incredible. I ultimately went with the avocado toast (yes, I am a basic white girl). After I saw the loaded breakfast potatoes that my friend ordered, I immediately ordered those on top of my toast. I can firmly say that was the best decision I made that day. Both the toast and the breakfast potatoes were out of this world and made me sad that I had to leave this wonderful establishment. If I am ever back in the Celveland area, you bet I am coming back!"}
{"text":"It's not every week you receive an invitation to visit a new friend with the intentions to check out martini bars and new restaurants. Flying Fig was my friends first choice for eating out in Cleveland. I'm no expert in this state, but the Flying Fig may have one of the most stylish decors in all of Ohio. Certainly Cleveland has never seen anything like it. The Flying Fig clan poured mucho dineros into the design alone. And the food...

 My friend ordered a huge hunk of hangar steak and potatoes dipped in duck fat.  She gobbled it down with pleasurable mmms. My order had simple ingredients done in a very interesting way.  Richly wedged polenta, as well as flat bread pizza with ricotta and mushroom. The portions were fairly small and a bit overpriced. Though, the food was exquisite. 

 Whether you like the look or not, you've got to applaud such investment at a time when the humble gourmet eatery has become an endangered species in many towns all across the US."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and loved it! Their HH cocktails change and are signature drinks. Mine had bourbon and was well made. The food was well priced at 5/6$ and was delicious. HH options include pulled pork nachos, burger, fries, cheese plate, vegetarian empanadas and more. Loved our waitress, Amy, she took great care of us!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner.  The wine list is a little hard to figure out (mostly European labels - didn't get a lot of guidance from the server), but found one that we did like.  
The cheese board was great!  Lots of things on it (needed to have more crostini's). 
The goat cheese salad was awesome. 
The dinners were very tasty and well thought out with complex tastes.  The service was so-so, but  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Mmm, I really like this place. I've been to their brunch a handful of times and, for me, that's really the way to go. I'm sure their dinner is delicious, but I've only had it once because my pocketbook yelled at me the first time. 

Service has been on point, especially during my most recent brunch visit with a friend. Our server was cheerful, attentive, and quick to offer suggestions when asked. Five stars for that. 

This weekend I had their avocado toast and started with their biscuit and some coffee. Coffee was tasty and refills were free. The biscuit had great flavor; I wouldn't say it was the most delicate biscuit (maybe slightly over handled prior to baking), but seriously no complaints here. It came with butter and apple butter. That apple butter was divine!

I would order the avocado toast again. The sandwich was hearty but not overfilling. I loved the almond butter on the toast (and I really wasn't sure if I would).

I've also had their sticky bun and chorizo and corn cakes. The seasoning on the corn cakes needed a little work and the cakes were dense (again, like it was a little over-mixed) but overall not a bad fish. The sticky bun was yummy (how can you go wrong?). 

I would rank Flying Fig as one of my top brunch spots in Ohio City. Even when I come during peak brunch or market hours, parking a few streets away and booking a reservation ensure a happy experience!"}
{"text":"Cons: 
-Sat us by the door, it was very unpleasant to feel the Ohio winter cold every time the door was opened.  You shouldn't seat people there during the winter!
Pros:
-Our charcuterie board was artfully plated.  Also the meats and cheeses were well-paired.  Fried livers were awesome too.
-Wait staff was very attentive and friendly.
-I think the prices are very fair for what you're getting
-Very attractive space, good place to go on a date."}
{"text":"After a failed attempt at trying to come here reservation-less during restaurant week, we decided to do my friend's birthday dinner here this past Saturday. We had a party of 10 and when I called to make the reservation, the girl I spoke with was SO friendly and helpful- I told her we were trying to get reservations for 8pm and after looking at the schedule, she said she would switch some things around (I figured where people were sitting) and would make sure she could make it work for 8pm (so generous, she could have easily just said to come in at a different time instead).

Anyways, I was the first to arrive at the restaurant and was actually a few minutes early (SHOCKING for me, trust me) and our table was already set up and ready for us.  I was seating and promptly greeted by our server for the night. His service was wonderful throughout dinner. People came in at different times (running late due to traffic/various reasons) and he would come by right away to get drink orders. 

Drinks were great. I had a glass of Cab and then switched to Grey Goose and Vodka with lemon. Whenever I neared the end of my drink, he would be on top of it and ask if I wanted another one (as he did with everyone). They made the drinks pretty darn strong, which was great. I would be pretty upset if I was paying the money and getting weak drinks! My friends all had a variety of cocktails from the menu and they all seemed to enjoy it. No one complained - except for the occasional \"wow that's insanely strong..\" but is that really even a complaint?? The biggest rave was probably about the margarita - I never did try it, but will the next time I'm there.

Overall, food was great. I wasn't too fond of my entree, but literally everyone else enjoyed their choices. We started with a few apps. We got the calamari which everyone enjoyed (I don't eat seafood, but tried calamari for the first time, but I won't review the taste since I have nothing to compare it to!). We also got the artisan bread plate. It came with a baguette, some focaccia type bread, and some thick multigrain bread. It was all so soft, fresh, and delicious!! It came with hummus, olive tapenade, fig, and butter. YUM YUM YUM!!! My fave app was the flatbread - butternut squash, ricotta, pecorino cheese, shallots. YUM YUM YUM. I'm a newfound fan of butternut squash thanks to this place!!! For dinner, I got a half order of the herbed Ricotta Gnocchi. I did the half because I was dumb and thought it would still be a decent size. I was highly disappointed in the portion, but I guess it's my fault for assuming what the sizes would be. But everyone else's plates were HUGE and if you doubled my portion it would def not be comparable. I also found the dish to be very bland :-\ but everyone else enjoyed their meals!! So I will just have to try something else next time.

Since it was my friend's birthday, we got a molten chocolate cake with ice cream on the side which was delicious! The waiter mentioned they do that for birthdays when I asked, but never mentioned that it's not complimentary and you will get charged for the cake - but it wasn't outrageous so it was fine. I just wish he would have communicated that better.

This place is definitely not cheap in my opinion, but you kind of go there expecting that! And, you definitely pay for quality - food AND service. I think overall it's all worth the prices they charge (except maybe my entree ;-) ...)

Overall, it was a great experience and I'm sure I'll be back! :)"}
