{"text":"I was craving steak and eggs - the $10.99 special is pretty good! My steak was cooked to my liking, the eggs were a little too runny but tasted great on my toast though.  I'd come back for something quick."}
{"text":"So they have a catch the lobster machine and you pay money for it. Second time I caught a big one and when it went to drop it, the machine pulled up and put it back in the water. The claw doesn't open to drop it. Bartender said it happens all the time but it doesn't get fix. So you don't get your money back or the lobster and there is no sign to say it's out of order. Bartenders were nice and said you  play at your own risk"}
{"text":"Save your money, this is the absolute worse in casino eating I have experienced.   Avoid the omelette, talk about overcooked eggs.   Coffee was absolutely horrible being  both weak and bitter, tasted like it was water with coffee flavoring.  And other family members complained that the steak was tough as shoe leather.   Avoid this place, you are better off getting your coffee from a minimart, and you can save the tip."}
{"text":"$6.28 for 2 scrambled eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and sourdough toast. What a deal! Ingredients were fresh and delish. Service was friendly smiley and quick.   Its located in the casino so its a little smokey inside but not so much in this restaurant. If there were anything to really gripe about itd be i had to butter my own toast. Lol"}
{"text":"Open 24 hrs!!  I dropped by w/ a party of 13 on a Saturday night at 2am, perfect timing... They have a late night dining menu w/ these awesome specials.  Sun-Thurs: Midnight - 7am Friday & Saturday: 2am- 7am  Here's some of the stuff we ordered:  Two eggs breakfat $1.99: Two eggs cooked any style , bacon or sausage, and breakfast potatoes.  T-Bone steak and eggs $4.99: 10 oz T-Bone steak w/ two eggs cooked any style, and breakfast potatoes.  Breakfast burrito $3.99: Large flour tortilla filled w/ scrambled eggs, diced sausage, bacon, green onion, home fried potatoes and cheddar cheese.  *The orders all include toast and jelly.  In addition, this place serves appetizers, soups, salads, burgers and dogs, side orders, hot and cold sandwiches, open faced sandwiches, entrees, italian entrees, eggs, skillet breakfast, omelets, pancakes, waffles, french toast, desserts, milkshakes, beer, and mixed drinks.   *Additional charge on take out orders, and 18% gratuity on parties of 8 or more.   For the price, the food is definitely worth it. We left paying less than $70 w/ tip included!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad, but not great.  What you get in terms of portions is on the generous side.  However, the service leaves a lot to be desired if you're trying to get some food.  On at least ten occasions, waitresses and bar personnel passed by and ignored me when I was there a week ago.  I wasn't noticed until I was there for 45 minutes.  Good thing there was a football game on screen that held my interest.  As for the bar, they display the typical \"F*** YOU!\" customer service attitude that is so common to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Party of 5 for lunch only 7 other tables occupied but it took half an hour to get our food. The only reason I rated it as high as I did is due to the bus person working our area. She was fast friendly and on top of everything! She handled 2 waitresses. Food was just ok nothing special. But props to that hard working woman."}
{"text":"Not the place to go if you want food.  Service was slow   Ordered Philly steak sandwich.  Wife ordered Chicken sandwich. Philly had no cheese or sauce on it.  Fries were good.  Chicken sandwich was uneatable. Could not cut it with a fork. Like rubber. No sauce or mayo on it.  Waitress did take the price of the sandwich off bill. Good place to watch a game and have a drink.  No food."}
{"text":"Good food and great prices! Honestly there is nothing on the menu I have tried and not liked so far.Sometimes service is a little slow though.This is the only good place to eat in the Cannery.Stay away from the diarrhea buffet lol"}
{"text":"I like this place but sometimes its a hit and miss.  Just like anyplace, peak times cut down on food quality and service.  The food is good and prices are reasonable.  One of my favorites meals is the chicken club sandwich...delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is usually good, but a week ago i passed by the bar with a friend who decided to drop a couple bucks in the lobster machine. He caught the BUG clean, and when the claw pulled back up it just opened up and dropped the bug back in the group. We looked over and saw the bartender and a couple patrons laughing at us. This was 12-17-14. I will see that I don't spend any money there for quite awhile!"}
{"text":"The food inside victory cafe in the cannery is horrible ! Low quality food!"}
{"text":"Last year on St. Patrick's day I came here to celebrate. Sat down at the bar and ordered an Irish Car Bomb. A traditional ICB is 1/2 pint Guinness Bailey's and Jamison dropped into the pint glass for those who don't know. THIS year, all the ad's say $1 car bombs. So, of course I order up an \"Irish Car Bomb\". The bartender tells me that they ARE NOT serving traditional \"Irish Car Bomb's\" and their version was \"green dyed Pabst with house bourbon. At that point I drank my Guinness and walked out. Last time I go there for drinks."}
{"text":"A good-enough breakfast restaurant.  We happened to be in the area and breakfast time and gave it a shot.  I had a build-it-yourself omelet, which can get rather expensive if you go for a lot of ingredients.  If that would be your choice I'd go to the buffet.  My wife had a some kind of Mexican concoction that she enjoyed and there was plenty of it for even the most ravenous appetite.  The food was all good, but nothing special.  And it's open air to the casino which may be a plus, minus or neutral depending on the individual."}
{"text":"The early 2 egg, hash browns, toast and choice of bacon or sausage for $2.99 before 7A is so worth getting up early. Service is quick, friendly & accurate. I hit up this spot every morning I'm in Vegas no matter which hotel I stay at."}
{"text":"Marietta has to be the rudest person ive ever seen. Trying to force me to sit down.when i wanted togo. Askes for drink to go nothing asked for my wings how many come in it she says 10 or 12 ask for light sauce is like in a pool wtf. Then tells me i know the menu up and down inside out. Bever go back if she is there the other girls are better hosts"}
{"text":"BEWARE:  I do not recommend eating here, but if you do, double-check your tab!!  They overcharge for food.  Very sketch and shady place.  I came here because I had a coupon for a buy one, get one Victory Breakfast (valued at $3.99) that came with the hotel stay at Cannery's.   I ordered two entries, which was supposed to be $3.99 each as stated on the menu, but when the waiter brought up my tab, it was priced as $5.99 each.  When I flagged down a waiter to clarify the discrepancy, he acted confused and then said that the price change would be reflected when I went to pay at the cashier.  So I waited until everyone finished eating to pay...and guess what?  The price didn't change.  The cashier pretended like everything was fine, and since I had already made a big scene with the waiter, I didn't want to seem \"cheap\" and bring it up AGAIN--it just felt incredibly embarrassing even though I knew I was right.  I also used the buy one breakfast, get the $3.99 victory breakfast free coupon, and INSTEAD of taking off the $5.99 charge for one breakfast, they used it as a -$3.99 coupon off the $5.99 they incorrectly charged me with!!!!!!!!!!! WHY state that the breakfast is $3.99 on the coupon BUT THEN CHARGE THE CUSTOMER $5.99 for it??? Absolutely atrocious!   As for the level of service, I felt uncomfortable while eating here...the staff members are \"fake\" friendly.    This experience left a bitter taste in my mouth.  Even though this review is for Victory's Cafe, I would reconsider the possibility of NOT staying at Cannery's hotel again because of this sketchy cafe."}
{"text":"wow! what an awesome place for karaoke!! the dj was soooooo incredibly awesome!!!! we danced and sang and he created such a fun atmosphere!! i was soooo sad when it ended!!  dj tiny rocked it! im coming back next saturday!!! fyi  friends sat 9pm-1am  victory bar and grill!! cheap drinks and lots of great memories!"}
{"text":"We stopped in Victory's Cafe for lunch before seeing a movie at the Galaxy Theater (which is AWESOME, BTW), and we were both pleasantly surprised at how good the food and service was at this hotel-casino diner. (Not sure why it's listed on Yelp as a \"bar and grill,\" but whatever...)  My husband had his old standby: fish and chips. I wasn't too hungry, so I had a half-size Chinese chicken salad. First off, I love the fact that they offer half-size salads because I can never finish a full-size order and it's sometimes not feasible to bring the leftovers home (like today). This salad wasn't the best I've had, but it was pretty good. And my husband LOVED his fish and chips. Three big fillets, a HUGE pile of fries, some bland cole slaw (could have left that off), and a small ear of corn (?).  At restaurants like this, I usually order a club sandwich but, as I said, I wasn't that hungry and I didn't want to bring back leftovers, so I opted for the salad. A customer at the next table DID order the club sandwich, and it sure looked tasty. In fact, all the food around us looked and smelled great. And our waitress served up a smile to each and every customer in the place. Although the location is a little far from our home, we've found a new favorite theater in the Galaxy, so we'll definitely be coming back to the Cannery. And we'll probably be stopping in at Victory's Cafe, only next time it will be AFTER the movie, so we can take home the leftovers!"}
{"text":"I come here at least twice a week and use my comps for food. So far I like their chicken fingers but their patty melt is very good.  I also love their breakfast sandwich as well. I usually get it with bacon, sour dough, over easy egg, and cheddar cheese.  Definitely better than fast food if you have 1o or 15 minutes to wait. Or you can dine in. I havent tried a lot of their food but so far so good."}
{"text":"Great food service and pleasant staff. We ordered blueberry pancakes $6.99 and a custom jalapeño omelette meal. They are always surprisingly consistent with the pancakes - blueberries were plump and fresh never frozen and the 3stack pancake was HUGE. The staff were also kind enough to have substitute sugar free syrup upon request. The omelette was folded nicely filled with a generous amount of jalapeños - a hefty serving of hash browns and white toast. I'll definitely do spinach and Swiss cheese next time. Place was busy but our coffee cups kept filled."}
{"text":"I have been going to Victory's off and on for years. Great onion rings this last time, and ordered a tostada salad to go. We were having a meeting there in the afternoon. Nobody rushed us and the first server was great. He went on break and the second server was not so great. The problem with Victory is service and food is inconsistent.  Prices are good, and in the afternoon, smoke not such a problem."}
{"text":"Cheap, basic and tasty.  Cruised through while driving to cali and needed a quick breakfast.  Fast service and funny people to entertain.  Definitely a down-home feel to it."}
{"text":"This is a 24-hour diner-ish place in a casino. Therefore, I am rating it as a 24-hour diner-ish place in a casino.   Ate there 3 times. Had a Spanish waitress 2 of those times. Her name escapes me. She is excellent. Upbeat and on point.   The food is as you'd expect from such a place. Had breakfast once and dinner the other two times. Not going to knock your socks off, but it's not supposed to. Just a decent meal, which is fine.  Very thankful Cannery has a 24-hour dining option."}
{"text":"Love this little gem hidden away inside a smoke filled casino! We've been here maybe 20 times now? Every sandwich is delicious. Brings back good memories of east coast diners. Don't be silly and order a dinner entree here, go to the steakhouse for that. The breakfast and lunch entrees are the best. The Reuben and Buffalo chicken are my favorites. You can't beat it for under $10. Eggs Benedict is also really good and hard to find in Vegas. Everyone is so friendly at Cannery, from the dealers to the pit bosses to the waitresses. If they could do something to ventilate out the cigarette smoke it would be the best locals casino by far."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I rolled in after 11pm last night to split a club sandwich. I don't know what it is about this place, but they know how to make a killer club- I've tried imitating it with no luck.  FOOD: The sandwiches here are huge, so Jason and I always split the club. We special order it with half ham, half turkey (it usually comes as a turkey club). On the side we got chips and cole slaw. All of the food was awesome as always, it came out exactly as ordered and split on two plates, both had garnishing. We were pleasantly surprised that it came out like it was meant to be two dishes. Loved it.  SERVICE:  Amazingly, better than the sandwich was the service we received this time around. Our server, May (according to the receipt), seemed to be reading our minds- a quality of a superior wait staff. Our drinks would linger with one sip in the bottom and she'd be out with another glass. I hate when servers drop the check while I'm still dining (even when they make sure to say that there isn't a rush, it always makes me feel a little rushed), and May dropped the check off a few moments after I finished my last bite. I love not asking for anything while I'm dining, and May received the first 50% tip I'd given out in quite a while.   Absolutely no complaints about the food or service- Refreshing isn't it?"}
{"text":"Weekend breakfast was excellent! I had the 2 egg breakfast and hash-browns for $3.99 plus I added 2 thick maple smoked bacon strips for $2.00 more and wonderful sourdough toast. My coffee was great and my waitress was very attentive and friendly. Wife order delicious Texas size (enough for 2) French toast. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"If you lose all but $20 in the Cannery casino, stop gambling and spend it here. You'll need a cheap filling meal before you drive back and lie about how much money you actually lost.   We went here because it was my brother in law's birthday. He is the cheapskate in our family. He is a former accountant after all. He recycles aluminum cans, loves the Goodwill store, is not impressed by designer labels, and loves a bargain. So on his birthday, a favorite meal, prime rib, was the same price as a McDonald's meal. It's not fancy, it's not great, but it's good. Victory's is a working man's 24/7 cafe in the center of the Cannery casino off Craig Road way off the beaten track of Las Vegas. It's loud, smokey, bright, with sounds of bells and sound effects from the slot machines nearby.   Their usual special, an 8 oz, Prime rib dinner was $5.99 served au jus, cooked to your liking came with a small salad, small bowl of cooked frozen veggies, mashed potatoes with brown gravy, and roll.  The salad was slightly dry but fine.  Their mashed potatoes were reconstituted, and rolls were just okay.  The meat was tender and good. Of course, it was the big seller.  My sister ordered the taco salad for $7.50, and definitely looked yummy.  Coke was $2.00. Other great specials are $10 one pound Porterhouse,  the T-bone $4.99 steak and eggs, and the $6.00 Sloppy Joe sliders.  Clientele was mostly average Joes and Joans of various colors, sizes, and persuasions.  For example, the party of four next to us had one scruffy guy wearing a \"I love Deer Hunting\" cap while his bald and bearded friend wore a Harley Davidson vest. Their wives looked like they were fans of Laura Ashley.  Lots of hip hoppers, families with crying kids, two women sporting their lumberjack outfits.  No one comes here dressed up, especially with the smell of smoke from the casino permeating every fabric thread and hair on you body. So, fancy no, but crowded and popular, yes.  However, service was good. Our waitress was efficient, a smiley chubby All American girl type. Our drinks, salads, and food all arrived at the same time.  She was good about bringing refills, styrofoan \"to go\" containers, and getting the check ready promptly. Lots of sad faces throughout that casino.  Probably not a great night for gambling.  But it was a decent meal for the price.."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here a few times and for the most part have been satisfied. The chicken fried steak and corned beef and hash are amongst my wife's favorites. Although the hash is clearly out of the can, they do it right."}
{"text":"This cafe is probably one of the last that has decent prices for graveyard specials.  But not just that, even tho I only come here for the graveyard special, they give service as if you ordered a steak and lobster dinner with wine.  My waitress, which I now request everytime I go here, is on top of her game.  Ask for Tina, and get your hashbrowns extra crispy!"}
{"text":"My bf and I come here when it's late or when we don't know what we want to eat. The food is good as well as the service. No matter what time of the day you come here... Staff is always friendly! it's inexpensive and one of the better places to eat when you're hungover at 3am!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast, good prices and service. I ordered the NY Steak and Eggs  (10.99) and it was good  Would I go back.  I would"}
{"text":"I've come here a couple of times while staying at/near the Cannery. Was going to the theater and wanted a bite to eat before the show. My fiance ordered breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, and toast. I asked for a couple minutes to look because I didn't want breakfast (it was around 11ish).  After about 5-8 minutes later (the server walked by our table and took other tables orders and I tried to flag him down 2-3 times), he finally came over to take my order. He brought out my fiance's food in record time and he started eating it--the eggs were overcooked and the bacon was limp and had probably been sitting. He thought it had been already been ready and waiting for another table or something, because half of his stuff was blah, but he didn't want to complain. I sat there for another THIRTY minutes waiting for my sandwich. My fiance finished everything he would eat off of his plate and his drink. The server never came over to our table to tell us what was taking so long or to offer us refills. After over thirty minutes went by, they brought out half my plate--and said they were waiting on fries. Fries take about 5 minutes to make, max. Seeing as I ordered a whole half an hour before, I am thinking he forgot to put my order in at all and had royally messed up. I ask him to refill our cups and we'd wait for the fries, not that he offered anything else (I would have subbed fresh fruit or chips or something at that point).  When the fries came out, I was half done with my sandwich, my fiance had been done with his meal for about twenty minutes already, and we'd been there over forty-five minutes. The server had also messed up the next table's order pretty badly (whole wheat toast for English muffin? lemonade for orange juice? missing oatmeal?) so I don't know what was up with our server or if he was all there, but it was really sub-par service. He spent most of his time hiding in the back.  When we were ready to leave (the server dropped the check with the fries at the table), we asked if we could get our drinks to go--actually, I asked a passing busboy because our server disappeared again and didn't check on us. He goes, \"yeah, yeah, in a minute\" as we are on the edge of the booth waiting to leave. We asked a third person to bring us to-go cups, and they did, so we could finally pay and leave. The first busboy was standing at the front chitchatting to the cashier, which was holding up the line, keeping us from leaving. Our server still hadn't come out of the back after dropping off the other portion of my plate to check on us, and we were waiting to pay.  All in all, we had some realllllly slow crappy service here today. We've had a lot of good food here for reasonable prices in the past, and it's always been a good place to stop before or after the movies, but now I'm just tired of the BS. Poor service = no return. Only thing saving from it being 1 star was that my chicken sandwich was really well made and tasty."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very inattentive. She got us our food and we barely saw her again except as she was walking right by us. Got the Cheesesteak with the macaroni salad. The cheesesteak had no flavor and the macaroni salad tastes like cardboard. The French fries taste like they have soaked in grease for days. Will definitely not come back"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. I don't think they cook much of anything. Everything seems to taste like it's either frozen or canned. Even salsa and marinara - all canned. With the marinara you would think they'd take time to heat it and add spices, but no. Just straight from the can to your table.   The dishes are never really consist. Sometimes you'll get burnt food or overly spicy - it just depends on who is working that day. The catfish is pretty good. I've had it a couple of times.  The service is hit or miss, which doesn't bother me too much. I'm pretty sure I'll be back because it's cheap and convenient. Just don't expect greatness."}
{"text":"Always enjoy the service and food here.  It is cafe style food and we usually get wings to start then a sandwich with one of their delicious (I think pickled on site) dill pickles...delicious!"}
{"text":"I have family who lives in Las Vegas - one who has VIP status at the Cannery Casino in North Las Vegas - which is how I ended up at Victory's for breakfast one one of my visits there.  Service was excellent, which I would expect, not because of the VIP status, but because there wasn't a lot of people eating there when we were there. It was early and a lot of people were probably in church before heading here for their meal and to give their offering.   Food was good - definitely not gourmet but good enough that I'd go back if I was looking for a place to sit down and eat - and not pay an arm and a leg.   Lots or parking at this property and it's not close to the strip so there's no crowds of crazy tourists.   Been here a few times and I've not had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"OK for a casino restaurant. Decent chicken caesar salad. We did have to sit in the back to get away from smokers as best we could, but that's what you deal with in a casino.  Good service."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed as a breakfast lover....I mean who puts sliced cheese on a omelet??"}
{"text":"Every Sunday the ruffle different thinks if you buy bear the give you a red ticket but at the time the manager from the bar get the tickets and said Who is the winner never said the ticket number or read the name always it's the people she know every week it's the same people after there friends Winn she walk and spoke with them and it's only the PEOLE she know the it's really unprofessional and make looks bad to the casino"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times over the past four years and it's always been \"okay\".  Not bad enough to avoid, but only good enough that if I had other reasons to be there, it was an acceptable meal because of convenience.  Teetering between two and three stars, I've never rated it before, following what mom always taught me:  if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything.  After yesterday though, the scale firmly tipped downward.  And mom doesn't Yelp.  Service:  The service was below average.  It was so-so before, and worse this time.  Oddly, our waitress was training a new waitress, so I'd expect that the service would be rock solid if not a bit on the \"too much\" side as the trainer is ensuring the trainee sees everything.  Our waitresses were very polite but their visits to the table were intermittent.  There were several other members of the waitstaff who seemed to periodically notice our glasses were empty and would ask about refills.  It was pretty random.  Food:  There were four of us in the party and none of us finished our meals.  The food tasted bad and in the case of mine, it actually smelled bad.  Two of us didn't get the food we ordered.  If I wasn't pressed for time and there for a business lunch with colleagues, I would have taken the time to track down management, but we had to go.  Because I don't want to leave this hanging, I intend to track down the restaurant's management next time I'm in the casino.  Needless to say, seeing the service and food experience go from a 2-3 star level across time, to a solid one-star compelled me to finally write a review.  While I'll go back to talk to management, I won't eat there again."}
{"text":"After all these years, I am STILL a fan of Victory's!  I used to live in North Las Vegas, but moved out of the area around 2012. What that means is that I now rarely get to visit the Cannery on the north side.  I happened to be in the area again and stopped in to enjoy Victory's Cafe once again. Service was on point, as usual. The food is solid and at affordable prices. It's not the kind of place you drive across town for, but if you happen to be at the Cannery casino, it's a great option for good, affordable eats!   still 4 stars."}
{"text":"Still a fan.  This place is very consistent.  Most recently, I had a taco salad with a cup of southwestern chili.... very good stuff!!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across the lovely Victory's during my free play and stay package from the station casinos! There was no wait and we were seated right away which is always a plus!! After accumulating so many points my friend was able to score us a free room along with some food vouchers that gave us $25 off any restaurant located within the casino! Well we actually picked this place by default because it was so late and everything else closes at either 9-10 PM! Glad we did they had pretty good service for the most part AND some amazing fish and chips!! Ordered that along with the catfish platter and mozzarella sticks everything was super fresh and came out in a very good time! Didn't have any room for desert but I'm sure that would've been just as good as the rest of our meal!"}
{"text":"Worst food I have ever had... do not get the gyro's atleast... they have no idea what they are doing and served dehydrated meat that was hard as a rock with no taste... what a waste of money. Shouldn't be serving nasty old food to people but also got it to go... probably could careless at that point if you're taking it home."}
{"text":"Wound up at Victory's kind of by default. It was the only place to grab some grub inside the Cannery after 10:00pm. As far as \"cafe\" food goes, it wasn't too bad. The french fries were hot and crispy. The service was good and the Club Sandwhich hit the spot. The iced tea tasted instant and I was a little disappointed with the cheese stick appetizers. They seemed a little generic, kind of like you would expect to make at home from your grocery store's freezer. There are plenty of other eateries in the area, but for what it is, Victory's Cafe puts one in the win column. Nothing that would keep me from coming back, but I won't be driving across town just for the food."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since it opened and then we moved away. Went there the other day for lunch with my husband. I had opened faced turkey sandwich and my husband had the pastrami sandwich they were both very good. I asked the waitress if this was always the case and she said that  the food was homemade and she has served many.  When in the neighborhood will try them again."}
{"text":"Holy hell. This restaurant needs serious help. They need to make a call to Robert Irvine from Restaurant Impossible or something. The service was great but the food was weird. And just bad, really bad.  Ready for this?  I ordered a Chef's Salad (minus the meat) Roughly $8-$9.00  It had slice American cheese on it. SLICED. PROCESSED. AMERICAN CHEESE. Like the kind you put in kids grilled cheese sandwiches. This cheese was cut into strips and laid on top of the salad. The tomatoes were cut so huge I couldn't fit them in my mouth I had to cut them up! Never in my life have I seen such a horribly pathetic and tragic attempt at a Chef's Salad. Who allowed slice cheese on a salad? That's all I want to know.  The mozzarella sticks looked like chicken fingers? It had the same type of breading. And it was wayyyy over salted.  Oddly, the french fries were actually really good. How does that happen?  My bf got a patty melt, surprise surprise, it was a little undercooked, horribly greasy and ultimately flavorless.  Onion rings were burnt.   Pretty sure their water is straight tap water. It tasted like unfiltered hose water.   Come on guys. Really? Get help and hire some trained professionals, please!"}
{"text":"Perfect quick bite before a movie.   We got a buffalo chicken sandwich.  Yum!!! Crunchy and huge!  also got a Cobb salad.  It wasn't amaIng but was what was expected. :)"}
{"text":"While in Las Vegas I met my dad here to watch the Detroit Lions kick off the NFL season. We sat down and waited 10 minutes to get a drink, which was odd because there was only 3 people in the whole place. The Victory Cafe had just reopened after being closed to remodel, and if you ask me there was a lack of tv's and too many tires.  Note to ownership, people don't watch car tires they watch tvs, way to much waisted space.  We ordered an app which was disappointing. The sampler app had 5 things on one platter all done poorly. Chicken wings & strips tossed with a boring sauce.  Cold fried cheese curds, mushy fried mushrooms and some onion rings that were inedible. The Wifi did not work and they were no help getting it fixed.  The Lions game was supposed to start at 10 and they couldn't get it to work. I know you just reopened but Its not hard to turn it to the channel the game is on. We ended up talking our show on the road down Craig street to Bdubs. Get it together guys."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, over priced cheaper quality meat. No local late night special $11 for steak & eggs same steak & eggs you get anywhere for $4.99-$5.99. Breakfast Sandwich Bagel not toasted bacon cold. Food very Greasy, Staff was very friendly. But food and price is the reason not many people in Restaurant late night."}
{"text":"This review is for during lunch time. Also, some of these reviews are for the restaurant - this is specifically for the bar.  We had a couple $10 food credits to burn, so we decided to stop by this place. My husband wanted to watch the game and he liked their TV setup, plus they had a couple tables that were not high tops. Originally I was given a very limited menu, but when I asked if I could order off the actual cafe menu next door, the server obliged and brought me out a regular menu. Our server did let us know though, that if it's busy, there was no guarantee that I could order off the regular dining menu, so YMMV!   I got the Asian Chicken Salad. Everything was great about this except for the chicken. Would have liked a little higher quality meat. But it was a very hearty salad and the dressing was very good!   My husband got the pastrami sandwich and he greatly enjoyed it. We also got our fries extra crispy which was a nice tough per our request.  Our server, Chris, was on the ball. We had a few drink and food requests and he was good with everything. Service was prompt and efficient. Granted, it was a slower part of the day but we were both pretty happy. The food was reasonably priced too, even before the dining credit."}
{"text":"This place has a great breakfast special for only $5.99 ( eggs bacon hashbrowns toast) and it was a huge portion. I liked how the toast comes in a basket..very cute. Although it was busy on a Friday morning ( buffet is closed until 10:30) the service was great and food was good. Great job Cannery!  You stepped up your game. I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"The Cannery casino & hotel is basically down the street from me they have a luxury movie theater that I go to all the time and which I love. But last night a couple of friends and I went to gamble and afterwards got quite hungry so we decided to come here. I give it 2 stars and here's why.   The reason I give this place two stars is based on the food alone. I ordered chicken wings hot with a side of onions rings. Now usually I don't like giving reviews on just one experience but this needs to be done. The chicken wings were severely over cooked! I felt like I was just eating the bones! How could you serve someone something like that and be fine with it. It's like the chief went into the freezer threw the chicken wings into the fryer forgot about them ,somehow remembered again and took  them out threw franks red hot on them and said here you go enjoy.  Ugh at least my onion rings were decent. Now I did eat the chicken bones oops I mean wings, and the only good thing about that is I'm pretty sure my jaw muscles are stronger than ever now.  The only reason I didn't tell them to take them back is because I've already been waiting a long time and I was super hungry so I didn't want to wait again.   This review is not on the restaurant it self ,the service was excellent the server was super friendly which I enjoyed . But bottom line chiefs you should be proud of your work never put out anything less than amazing. How do you over cook chicken wings ?  Anyways I love The cannery and I'm sure the other items on Victory grill cafe are much better than they're wings.  Just don't and I repeat don't get the wings. No ! No! No!"}
{"text":"I ordered the hamburger with mozzarella cheese,  which was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. The homemade potato chips was perfect. The service was good. Will come back again if at the Cannery."}
{"text":"Breakfast was fine, and dinner was just okay. Nothing special about the food, but the staff was excellent.  We had the prime rib roast and the prime rib and both were bland and tough! Best thing going for this place is the cost. Oh, and the smoke is overwhelming."}
{"text":"Manager was very welcoming. Patti got everyone's order correct and there was 11 in my party."}
{"text":"The hot roast beef was good. The price was cheap but so was the service. After seated we waited five minutes and when the the waiter greeted us he said, \"are you ready\".  He acted like he had been waiting for us."}
{"text":"Food is usually pretty good.   I had the Fish and Chips this time and they suck!  The Chicken sandwich for $5.99 is great if they still have it.  Prices are OK, gets cheaper at night but the selection on the graveyard menu is poor.  I have probably ate here 50 times, yeah, I'll go back again.  Only 2 stars because the fish is terrible, didn't even finish it."}
{"text":"Man, this has to be the worst experience I've had in years.   - 1 star for service: My party waited for 10 minutes to even be acknowledged. Despite the fact that there was an employee wiping tables and an employee right at the cash register, they all saw us and chose to ignore us. A simple \"someone will be right with you\" would have sufficed. I would have even been fine with a smile.   - 1 star for food quality: We had a pretty big order and here's the break down -- wings (good), chili cheese fries (sour cream tasted like rotten milk), steak and eggs (steak was skimpy), and an order of French toast (raw in the middle).   - 1 star for employee(s): A heavyset younger girl with blonde hair firmly avoided eye contact with every customer, cussed during conversations with other employees while rolling silverware on a table, continually kept asking other employees if she could leave.   - 2 stars for environment and lack of management: A large party of clearly drunk and loud men came in. Immediately when they were seated, the entire dining area was disrupted by their belligerence and witnessed them demeaning the middle-aged Hispanic woman who was simply trying to help them. It disgusts me that they continued to serve them and subject this employee to this treatment."}
{"text":"To be clear, this place is split into its bar and grill area and it's just regular restaurant. The bar and grill area only serves quicker and mostly fried bar food whereas the restaurant has the full menu.  While I thought my food was good - I ordered a beer beef stew pie concoction - the rest of my party didn't enjoy theirs for the most part. That wasn't helped by the fact from time of ordering to time of delivery, it took 1 hour and 5 minutes or several requests to get water to our table.  We saw several other guests turn their food back in because it was cold or something else was wrong, though that wasn't an issue for us.  You will still be exposed to some smoke for the casino, and the bar area is definitely smokey.  Overall, avoid if you can. This place stinks."}
{"text":"This review is for the bar FOOD only! The portions absolutely suck!  A 5\"x4\" dish with soggy thin bread things that take up the whole plate., leaving a sorry amount of lettuce.  Basically expect a plate of soggy bread instead of a Cesar salad.  The bar itself and the bartenders are awesome.  80\" TVs everywhere and a lobster machine.  I just wish they would have left South park pinball out here instead of moving it back to galaxy theater arcade which is not 24 open hours.  I will definitely return; however, i will not be ordering food."}
{"text":"Stop by here for breakfast again hoping to give them a another chance before I posted my review. This place is set up nice with good spacing and waiters are very nice. But the food isn't the greatest. The first time I ate breakfast here I got the make your own omelet which was just ok, I asked for very light cheese and they smothered it with cheese and omelet was a little warm which calls the cheese to be clunky. I returned it back and still wasn't impressed. So today me and the wife cane again and I order the steak and cheese, the steak had zero flavor and had to add A1 sauce all over, hash browns tasted like mashed potatoes with strings and the eggs were eggs it's hard to go wrong on that. Over all I will not try this place again not even to pass time. If you stay in the Cannery just go across the street to Starbucks or just take a trip out to get breakfast. But like I said earlier the waiters and host was wonderful."}
{"text":"My relatives brought me here for dinner while I was in Vegas.  Alright, its a casino cafe, parking was busy, loud because of the gamblers and machines...  But the food was good and portions were good. price wasnt bad. The service was great the staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Came to Victory's Cafe on a whim since it was late and a lot of other places were closed for dining.  24 cafe baby!  Not bad when you are super hungry and have not-so-super amounts of money in your pocket (damn you...slots).  Of course, this being a 24 hour joint, late at night you do attract some interesting people.  This night, I swear half the patrons eating were buzzed, drunk, super drunk, or well on their way on getting super duper drunk.  It was a bit loud and the air reeked of stale Heine(ken)!  Interesting, but not typically my type of crowd.  Luckily no belligerent drunks were trying to bully me, so I kept my left & right guns in their holsters.  No gun show tonight!  P90X you have become the bane of my existence.    Victory Cafe does have some late night specials as well as serving breakfast all day, which appealed to me.  Omelettes, skillets, pancakes, waffles, French toast, could all be had.  Because sometimes...you just want breakfast for dinner DARNIT!  The wifey thinks breakfast for dinner is illegal, so I constantly ask for Portuguese Sausage, Spam, eggs & rice for our evening meal.  Yeah, I'm like that.  The $9.99 Prime Rib special looked like a decent cut, but I wasn't feeling it that night.  So we just ordered off the regular menu.  I got a Build Your Own Burger, which I kept pretty basic with just Cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle, and onion with a side of fresh potato chips.  The lady got a Philly Cheese Steak that had sliced beef with onions, peppers, and mushrooms topped with Swiss cheese with a side of potato salad.  Sounds like late night eats to me!  Overall the food wasn't bad.  Nothing great, but it's hard to mess up a burger and a sandwich.  It's akin to what you would find in most late night eateries in just about any casino cafe here in Las Vegas.  Food for those that need to sober up so they can take their losing @$$es home.  Yes folks, majority of us gamblers here are LOSERS.  Make no mistake, that 99.7% payback on video poker and slots eventually lands you to ZERO!  My burger was cooked right, medium with a bit of pink, and the bun was thankfully toasted on the grill.  Cheese was nice and sharp, and the produce in my burger was fresh.  The big surprise was the fresh made potato chips!  They were great!  Nice, hot, and super crisp.  I ate these up with a side of Ranch dressing.  But they were just as good with a splash of hot sauce on top.  A welcome substitute for fries.  The wifey's Philly Cheese Steak was OK.  Nothing notable to write about, it just wasn't the best she's had.  Her potato salad was good, but for some reason it tastes very similar to the kind you can find in bulk at your local Costco or Sam's Club.  Which isn't all that bad, but something more home made would have been nice.    I will gladly go back to the Victory Cafe again if I'm on that side of town and want a quick and cheap bite to eat.  And possibly if I'm as drunk as a skunk.  There's a lot of heft in their menu and other things I would definitely give a try.  I love a good Denver omelette or a Club sandwich.  But I will definitely go back for some of those fresh made potato chips!  Victory is mine!"}
{"text":"Great prices, good comfort food and total epic fail on service.  That about sums up all the times I've ever eaten here.  Yesterday was no different, I was driving in the area and my tummy was talking to me.  Out of mere convenience I stopped in here for a quick bite.  The meal was fine but as I was leaving I was told the credit card machine was down.  It would have been nice to know that maybe before I was seated, you think?  Shady shady shady, so anyway I'm told to go to the ATM.  I could have easily dined and dashed but that's just not my style.  When I returned after having paid the ATM surcharge, and my banks surcharge, no sorry, no thank you, no discount for the inconvenience.  Over all my meal was more than double because of that.  So I won't be back, and The Cannery will no longer get any of my business."}
{"text":"My client is in North Las Vegas and this is close to his business. The restaurant is located in the Cannery Casino and never closes.   My lunch choice was the prime rib sandwich with cole slaw. To my surprise the food was really tasty! The prime rib sandwich was tender with tomato, lettuce, onion on a large roll and the cole slaw was quite good at a reasonable price.  This location is really North of the strip and I got the feeling many locals come here to gamble or eat cheap."}
{"text":"Doesn't sound fancy but if it was on my list for places to go for my bday dinner with friends then that must say a lot. I've never had a dish lacking flavor or size and I've tried many dishes from here. My family loves it and they will continue to get our service!"}
{"text":"Victory's Cafe is a total VICTORY in my book!  We popped into Victory's Cafe to grab a quick bite to eat before a movie.  When we got to the host stand, we were greeted with a big hello and a huge smile.  What a great way to start the meal!    We were seated immediately and had our drink order taken within a minute.  The guy who took our drink order was so happy and friendly.  Our server came over to us within another 2 minutes.  She was friendly and welcoming too, as well as good at her job!  Seriously, everyone in the joint must be on happy pills because they were all so nice.  I am just not used to this at most of the local casino cafes.  It is so nice to be around happy people!  The menu here is pretty large with a lot of variety.  They also have a lot of different specials going on throughout the week.  The prices were all very reasonable too, especially when you see how much food you get on your plate!  Almost everything was under $10 for a full meal.  We went with the Rueben and Buffalo Fried Chicken Sandwiches.  Both were awesome!  I'll start with the Rueben.  It was a triple decker style club style sandwich.  It easily had 1/2 a pound of meat alone on the thing!  It was a super duper tasting Rueben and one of the best ones in town that  have tasted.  The Buffalo Fried Chicken Sandwich was fantastic as well.  It came with a huge fried chicken breast covered in a spicy Buffalo sauce.  The chicken was cooked perfectly!  It was golden brown with the perfect amount of crunch.  DROOL! The Buffalo sauce was just hot enough to make your nose run a little and give you that oh so good burn on your tongue.  I had it with some blue cheese dressing and it sealed the deal on my love of this sandwich!   Now for the beauty that is now as a french fry.  The sandwiches could come with all sorts of sides like potato salad, veggies, and of course FRENCH FRIES.  Seriously, is there even a choice when french fries are an option?  Not in my book, baby!  The fries were thing thin style fries with some sort of coating on them, similar to beer batter.  My fries were the definition of perfection!  They were prepared wonderfully, with a slight crunch on the outside with a little bit of fluffiness on the inside.  Yum, yum, yummy, yum, yum!!!  We aren't regulars at the Cannery, but I see us eating here every time we come to this part of town.    Well now that have have relived last night meal, my mouth is watering for my next meal at Victory's Cafe!"}
{"text":"We live near the cannery and decided to give this place a try. Their portions of food are big and will get you full. They have a lot of great breakfast plates that beat Ihop. Plus its ok to bring your kids here. Will definitely be back here..."}
{"text":"Very moderately priced for a casino diner, great breakfast!!! Burgers are greasy and beautiful"}
{"text":"Had the Meatloaf and Chicken Parmesan and a Root Beer Float.  Both meals were well portioned, cooked to tenderness, seasoned to perfection - I mean, it's been a while since we've had a \"home cooked\" style meal. Customer service was great and the staff are always friendly.  The float was huge, so I'm glad we only ordered one and shared it. Glad we decided to do Victory's instead of the buffet."}
{"text":"This was my first visit for lunch.  The restaurant was located in the Cannery Hotel Casino on Craig Rd in Las Vegas.  My friend had a $25 food voucher and I had a $5 food voucher from spinning the wheel on Web Pass.  We were able to use both food vouchers on one ticket since the vouchers were in different names.  I ordered the Mighty Prime Rib Dip with fries.  The Prime Rib was a little fatty.  The creamy horseradish sauce was good.  The fries were hot and crisp.  I also ordered a NY Cheesecake to go.  The cheesecake was rich and creamy.  My friend ordered the Taco Salad and Plain Chicken Wings.  The wings came with carrots and celery and Ranch dressing.  We will be back since we have more food vouchers."}
{"text":"Holy Jesus was this place horrible from top to bottom! First we waited 20 minutes to get acknowleged with only about 10 other guests present....then it took another 45 minutes to get our undercooked steaks, overcooked hashbrowns and untoasted toast (yeah, it was bad). Refills on our coffee???...what refills.....I begged for a refill and still didn't get one. TAKE MY ADVICE AND EAT OUT OF A DUMPSTER BEFORE EATING HERE! You have been warned!"}
{"text":"Came down here to grab a late meal with a friend after attending the Formula Drift event at LVMS just a few miles away. A go to place after a event there. I ordered a chicken fried steak skillet and it was awesome LOL. Probably the best I've had in a long while. It was cooked perfectly and the country gravy did not congeal like some other places. Service was nice and drinks were refilled quickly. A downside is how smoky it is due to the open layout of the cafe to the casino and in the past service has not always been so good."}
{"text":"This is our Friday breakfast spot. It's close to home, it's consistently good, we never to have to wait for a table and it's cheap.   At least once, get the Idahoan omelette. It's epic -- hashbrowns, bacon, cheddar and sour cream inside  an omelette, served with toast and more hashbrowns.  But the best deal has to be the $3.99 egg & bacon breakfast, served with toast and hashbrowns. Cheap n' cheerful.  May is our favorite server, but Oscar is great, too.  Go, go any time you like (they're open 24 hours), but not on Friday mornings -- I don't want to have to start waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Ah what can I say about this place.. it's a small bar/cafe located at the side of the casino floor. If you want a nice ambiance with unique food this is not the place, but if you want greasy bar food with NASCAR flair, this is definitely your spot.   The menu includes typical bar food type items like wings, burgers, fried appetizers and a few sandwiches. There isn't much that's pescatarian or vegetarian friendly, but I ended up getting a Caesar salad, The portion was a large size which was nice, but it tasted just like a mix salad bag you can buy from Smith's aka nothing special. I guess the only things I did appreciate were the options for beer towers and the laughable menu names.  I can't say I'd come back anytime soon otherwise it was just to grab a drink."}
{"text":"Came here at like midnight and it was poppin'! Our waitress was fast, efficient and friendly.    I had the club sandwich and it was HUGE and delicious. Big slabs of thick bacon, not all soggy and nasty.   Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had an OK dinner. I say it was OK because I ordered the Siamese soup with shrimp for 6.99. It tasted like ramen soup with shrimp in it. Far from spectacular."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars I would. The bartenders are so rude! The blatantly ignored my friend and I. The other bartender told his coworker we were waiting, looked at us, and walked away. I've never been one to get mad and not order but this place definitely pushed me there."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while but for whatever reason I would just never find the time. Well this past weekend, I got together with some friends and we decided to check it out.  Victory's Bar and Grill is located inside the Cannery Casino, it's easy to locate because it's an open bar and grill, there are no walls in the front, and you can pretty much see the inside from the Casino floor. Since it's inside the Cannery yes you do have that smokey air quality but it's not too bad in the seating area inside victories.  We went up to the counter and the lady there was very nice, we were able to be seated fairly quickly ,and our server was there taking our drink order and within a few minutes we had our  drinks on our table.  There's a pretty cool Vibe, there's a lot of nice decorations on the wall, my first Impressions was that it was nice and clean, pretty well organized and there was quite a few people eating which is always a great sign.  I decided to order the chicken fried steak which also came with two eggs, with a side of wheat bread, and an iced tea. Our server had a good attitude by the way which makes your experience Pleasant obviously.  I believe you must have waited roughly 10 to 15 minutes to get our food which is not bad considering the amount of people that were seated at the time. Well I do have to say it was worth the wait because once I got my chicken fried steak I was impressed at the size of the chicken fried steak at that price. Well the chicken fried steak look good but did it taste good is the question.... not only did it taste good, but to my surprise I have to rate it as one of the best chicken fried steaks I've  had. It was crispy on the outside tender on the inside, the flavor was really good, and  the gravy complimented it very well. It also came with a side of hash browns which by themselves were actually quite good as well. I couldn't believe how good the food was, I don't know what I was expecting but to be honest I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm glad I came into victory's bar and grill and tried it because it turned out to be a nice little spot to have a good breakfast. Sometimes Impressions matter and I was fairly impressed,  so definitely I will be back in the future. Overall I give this place a 3.5 star rating."}
{"text":"June 8 @ 2:50 am I am standing behind a woman and man waiting my turn in line. After waiting, a few minutes and the lady standing across the restaurant rolling silverware, I started to get a little impatient. I asked the two people in front of me of they placed their order and the girl replied no. So, I walk up to the lady and ask her if she's working and if she plans to help the people waiting or continue to stare at us with confusion. Her response, \" oh I thought you were with them\". Not an apology or some kind gesture but that response and regardless of I have as with them or not, she still never came to see if she could help any of us with anything. When she was went to get the other lady from the back, I asked her what the lady standing in the back staring at the customers name was and her name is Tracey!!!! Tracey, may I say that you have horrible customer service skills."}
{"text":"Not bad on a Friday after work. Great beer prices-happy hour. Music starts at 8/9pm. DJ walks around. Introduced himself and asks what you want to hear. Smoking really starts to kick in around that time too unfortunately.  It's not well ventilated in this casino.  I did have buffalo chicken strips. They did NoT feel cooked very well so I did send them back. They were cooked second time so wasn't horrible but I'd still be skeptical to order again. Waiting staff was nice."}
{"text":"Very good chicken wings and chili cheese fries. Our server Scott was awesome!!! The rest were rude but I will still come back."}
{"text":"I spent my birthday watching a movie at the theatre that is next to the casino. After a fun time there, I was hungry. I came to Victory's for a bite to eat.  I ordered a bowl of chili and wings. The chili had a ton of green onions and grated cheese. It was hearty and so good! The wings are delicious, and came with veggies with ranch dip. Yum!  I celebrated with a beer to wash everything down. I also watched a baseball game on the giant TV screen as I ate.  It was a wonderful birthday in an area of Las Vegas that I had never been to.  (236)"}
{"text":"Never again! ! I ordered a steak medium and got a dried out piece of paper!  The manager was low key rude at first about it. So on top of waiting forever the food was super bad. They made me another steak that had zero flavor. Must have been marinated in water. They only charged us $10.80 for our whole order in the end. They need a better cook and faster service.  I still left a tip."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite after hiking. This review is for the sports bar which is next to the main cafe.   We sat for about 5 minutes waiting for a waitress. Luckily the bartender offered to get drinks. $9 pitcher which was nice for premium beer. When still no waitress showed up we went to the bar and put our food order in with him and went back to our table. The waitress did bring our food out later and apologized that she was late. Glad their bartenders stepped up.  Now the food.  Just had a burger which was average. Cooked well but nothing special. My husband got the chicken sandwich that according to the menu was grilled with chili spices and a spicey blue cheese dressing. No spices and plain blue cheese dressing. At least it was inexpensive."}
{"text":"Great chicken fried steak.  I'm a coffee lover and I salute business that leave a carafe on your table!  Great service @ 2300,left full & happy!"}
{"text":"Flavor-wise, this was the best bloody mary I've ever had. I just wish they would serve it in something other than a mason jar, as that makes it a little tough to drink. I ended up giving in and using a straw to get at the last of that liquid elixir dripped from the thighs of a goddess.   Breakfast was good, nothing too special, but at $3.99, it's hard to beat.  If you decide to go here, the cafe is next to the bar. Don't make the same mistake we made, and sit at a table in the bar; the service there was nonexistent. We'd still be sitting there if I hadn't gotten up and asked someone about breakfast."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere at this place. The service is good and the wait times is not that long."}
{"text":"If you are drunk and hungry this place will do the trick. If you are a healthy eater steer clear of this place!  Fried chicken and mashed potatoes, a gyro , or some late night omelettes are what you are going to find here. oh yeah and french fries they have lots of those."}
{"text":"Good food for the price!!! Recommend getting the chili cheese fries!!! They're delicious!!! Breakfast is always a winner too!!!!"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday 8-1-15 around 7PM.  This restaurant is located inside the Cannery Casino on Craig Rd. on the NW corner of the casino.    I ordered the prime rib ($14.99) which the menu states comes with \"seasonal vegetables, dinner roll, and your choice of potato\".  The top of the menu says you can add on a soup or salad for $1.99 extra.   So I asked for a caesar salad and the waiter says no, caesar salads are full price($7.99).  You can have a garden salad with caesar dressing on the side for $1.99 extra.  This is a crock of shit.  A dinner salad has mixed lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes,red onions, black olives, and croutons.  A caesar salad has romaine lettuce and croutons for $7.99.  Explain to me this logic??? Half as many ingredients for 4x the price!! This is a ridiculous policy and I'm not going back until they change it.   No dinner rolls were ever brought.  I didn't ask about them.    Server was nice enough and brought refills without having to be asked.    Unfortunately I have a sinus infection and I cannot taste anything so I'm guessing the prime rib was great.  It came with french fries (they remind me of Long John Silver's fries) and undoubtedly frozen-dumped-out-of-a-bag california mix veggies.  If you are at the cannery this is a decent place to eat.  I just don't like their asinine salad policy and they never brought me dinner rolls."}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing. I ordered a grilled cheese and it was soggy and barely melted. Processed cheese was used and still in a perfect little square. The manager was very attentive when I sent it back. They replaced my order with a chicken Caesar salad. How can you go wrong with that? Wrong! It was old lettuce soaked in dressing. I didn't eat the salad and just ended up paying for my meal to get the heck out of there. I would go elsewhere if you have a choice. Maybe they have a better breakfast selection."}
{"text":"HAIR IN FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! order the breakfast platter with eggs bacon and hashbrowns. I found a hair in the hashbrown........... Lost appetite after that.. No more victorys for me or the family."}
{"text":"Came in with 3 others for sundaes.  They have a \"warm brownie sundae\". Great price $5.49. Someone forgot to warm the brownies and used a brownie that was over a month old off the shelf.When you cut into it ,it turned to powder. Lol.. The vanilla ice cream , chocolate sauce and mounds of whipped cream were great. Skip the brownie ,,,just get the ice cream."}
{"text":"This 24 hours cafe is located in North Las Vegas in the Cannery Casino.  It is a nice friendly spot to get some inexpensive food for the locals residing in this part of Las Vegas.  I actually came here with classmates who are waiting to pick up their projects, which is being graded by the instructor during class.  So it is basically a free day and there is not much to do in N. Las Vegas ealier in the morning, except go find a spot for breakfast.  I wasn't hungry and ordered their Beer Bratwurst with a side of Macaroni, while my classmates all ordered some kind of egg breakfast.  Our waiter was super friendly, and took our orders like a pro.  Drinks were soon delivered to the table and most of our food arived a little after that.  I think mine was took the longest, because everyone was ordered breakfast items.  But I wasn't in any rush, since we were there to kill some time anyways.  The egg breakfasts all looked great, especially for the low prices.  My $4.49 Bratwurst when it did finally arrived didn't look too good. Flavor was okay, but it was really overcooked and really dried.  For the low price, I didn't have high expectations for the food.  But the attentive service was very good.  I will not be making a trip out of my way to come eat here, but if at the end of next semester we need to kill a few hours before going back to fetch our semester projects,  will probably be back.  BUT I will not be ordering any of their fancy hot dogs.  Value - very low price points. Service - very good Location - Great for locals living in the N. Las Vegas area. Parking -  Plenty to go around Food - Not the best, but it also does not cost an arm and a leg  It is a 2-3Yelp star review for me, but I will bump it to a 3 based on the fact that everyone else enjoyed the food, and the service was friendly and good."}
