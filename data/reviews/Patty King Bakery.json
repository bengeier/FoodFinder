{"text":"Fantastic place for some island eats. Patty's, Jerk Pork lunch highly recommend. Even have lamb and stew chicken and all around $6-7. What a deal, cheap but delicious eats."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the jerk pork (rice and peas) for the past 5 years for lunch every few months.  It has never ever let me down. Although the portions are lunch portion it's only $5  I've practically tried all their lunch meal items (jerk pork, chicken, roast chicken, ox tail, etc)"}
{"text":"I was driving by scarborough Town Center, saw them from the street and decided to check it out. They have all kinds of Caribbean food but I only tried the spicy beef patty and jerk pork on rice and peas. The patty tasted fresh and had a lot of filling, but the best part of the meal was the jerk pork. It was really tender. For 5 bucks a small box you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Best lunch special!  1/4 jerk chicken, curry chicken, stewed chicken, or jerk pork with rice and peas and a bit of coleslaw for only $5!!!  Can't be beat!  My favourite is stewed chicken and I always ask for extra gravy.    Service is fast and efficient.  There is only a take out counter.  There are a couple of high tables for people to eat at, but most just grab and go.  Only negative is the parking situation, which can be really annoying when people block the pathway."}
{"text":"Very good quality Jamaican take-out food.  This can be difficult to find.  The name would suggest otherwise, but there are a lot of other types of Jamaican food being offered here besides patties.  There is Jerk Chicken and curry goat amongst the other offerings.  Definitely worth the trip out."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch and while at first didn't love the food, it has begun to grow on me. This is definitely one of the best deals for lunch in this area. Five dollars for a small jerk pork or jerk chicken dinner, and the portion size is more than enough for a nice lunch. While I am not a fan of their rice (I feel like the rice and peas are not flavourful enough, and it's pretty aoggy) their jerk pork is very good. Nicelu cut into cubes and the right amount of spice. The coleslaw on the side is also a nice touch.   I am not a fan of their jerk chicken or patties, but they are decent for the price."}
{"text":"We came here to stock up on the beef patties, which are great. We tried some of the frozen samosas and they are even better! Highly recommended if you don't have a local purveyor."}
{"text":"The small jerk pork or jerk chicken with rice and peas is the best lunch deal in the city. A generous portion of tender meat with great jerk spice on a huge bed of rice for only $5.50.   Can't be beat!"}
{"text":"There's really no parking available here as you see at any one time there are 2-3 cars just parked in the front for a short time while they jump out and make an order of various Patty & Jamaican favourites at the retail end counter area although there is a small 3 table on the side for your standing pleasure.  Most people already know PATTY King at their local Grocery Store fridge or grew up eating these with their lunch allowance at Public School.  I guess this would be the lunch spot for the grown ups since it's within an industrial area but you'll see people from all walks of life.  Mom and her kids, UPS guy, Mr. Coffee guy, hungry 2 Patty guy.  Ox Tail(Small/$6.72) was beyond fall off the bone as even the bone themselves had the sauce/gravy colors.  The Tails were cut prior to cooking as you can see that they weren't cut off at each natural section, just something I noticed that doesn't add/subtract from the meal.  A good portion was provided as it comes with your choice of White Rice or Rice & Peas.  There are Jerk items, Curry items on top of Lunch Specials.  They carry Grace Pop/Juices and on one of the table there is a bottle of Grace Hot Pepper Sauce awaiting those more adventurous.  While I ate in, everyone else was taking their bags/boxes/individual Patties to go."}
{"text":"Came here early one morning and was greeted by the sweetest old man. He's old, he moves slow, but he has the sweetest personality and smile. I have more than enough patience for his service.   I came here looking for a dozen spicy beef patties and jerk chicken after a friend had raved about the two. At $5.50 for a dozen spicy beef patty seconds? That's a steal. After bringing them home and throwing them in the toaster over for a few minutes, the crust comes out SUPER crispy and flaky, the filling plentiful, flavourful, and packs a decent kick.   The small jerk chicken I ordered was ready in just two minutes! It was served over rice and peas and came with a small serving of coleslaw. The three pieces of jerk chicken was juicy, and quite flavourful. The rice and peas underneath, soaked in the jerk chicken juices was fresh and moist. Delicious! The small box actually fed me for two meals. I definitely need to come back for this one."}
{"text":"Don't judge me, Patty King is my favorite patty. The fact that this place will sell me 12 patties for $6 or so earns it an automatic 5 stars. The cheap patties are \"seconds\" so make sure you ask for seconds if you are on a bargain hunt. In actuality there isn't much different about the seconds from the regular product. Sometimes there's a little chunk of filling busting out of the seam but I've seen the exact same issue in the expensive boxes I buy at supermarkets so don't worry about it."}
{"text":"We come here for our patties and sausage rolls. They're yummy and fresh. They also have cooked/hot food if you're hungry in the area."}
{"text":"If you're hungry but low on dough, be grateful that there are places like this where you can score some food that'll keep your hunger at bay.  $6.25 lunch specials gets you a savoury chicken or pork dish, plain rice or peas and rice, with a can of pop. Generous portions for the price. Hubby liked the spicy jerk pork and I preferred the tender stew chicken.  Jamaican patties are 95 cents each or 3 for $2.48. Spicy beef patties (red dot) have a flaky exterior and spicy but pasty filling. Order it hot and eat it before it gets cold because it won't taste as good later on.  Go early because they will run out of certain items. Arrived at 4pm on a Wednesday and they were out of curry chicken and jerk chicken.  Sweet elderly woman who took my order gave me an extra patty for free because she said the first one was not hot enough. Happy to add this place to my \"$\" list."}
{"text":"I love to get bags of frozen patties here as they sell seconds at a cheaper price then patties anywhere in T.O. Also as an added bonus they have a wonderful hot table full of delicious meals. And the daily special is so cheap and includes a drink. The only thing negative is that they do not sell the wonderful baked goodies that the Patty King shop in Kensington  Market has."}
{"text":"Patties have to be eaten fresh. Like right out of the oven fresh. You can get that here. More of a takeout joint through. Try the patty with a freshly made coco bread. The cocobread here is huge and so soft when its fresh. There is constant line up since the food here is good, low cost and filling.  Also tried the jerk pork sandwich. The portion of pork meat is very generous. I gound the meat a bit dry though. Highly recommend the patties if eaten within a short period of time."}
{"text":"Ordered the jerked pork with rice and peas. The pork was tender and juicy. $6.50 combo can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I had never tried a Jamaican patty until I travelled to Toronto and they were on every corner like hot dog carts in Vancouver. My first was at a bakery in Kensington market but I assume Patty King sells all over.  They are delicious. Slightly spicy, very greasy and packed with curry and all spice flavour.  My Gawd  if you could find these all over Vancouver they would become my new favourite drunk snack.  And you know why their so good right? Suet, and lots of it. Combined  with a pasty meat slurry in the greasy pastry. Man these are good.  But im kinda glad you cant find them everywhere in Vancouver !!"}
{"text":"You gotta love the prices at Patty King - so affordable!!!  Get the Spicy Beef Patty with Doubles for $1.30.  The lunch specials are also great value.   Parking is challenging on the front but space is available in the lot in the back."}
{"text":"Patty King is good for cheap good eat!   Jerk Pork with Rice ($4.43) eating that made me really happy. Tender pork with the perfect spice and at under $5?!!!  Now I know why there is always a line up at Patty King! And it definitely worth the wait.  There are a few small standing table if you want to dine in."}
{"text":"This is the magical place where all the Patty King patties are made. It's a factory, but they have a retail area in the front that gets crammed with people on lunch breaks around noon.  The reason I love Patty King is because they sell all sorts of Jamaican treats -- Jerk chicken, rice and peas, those coconut nectar drinks, sweet breads, and of course, every kind of patty you could dream of. Patties are chicken, veggie or beef in varying levels of spice, and if you buy them in the store they're only a dollar. Lunch specials of chicken, rice and a drink range from $4-$8.  But the real reason I come here isn't for the lunch special. It's because you can buy a bag of frozen patties that weren't pretty enough to make the boxes they sell to grocery stores, and they're craaaazy cheap. Literally they end up being around 30 cents each. For a package of 12 patties, I remember it being around $4. Grab a couple of bags, stash them in the freezer, and whenever you get the patty craving, pop one in the oven for instant gratification.  The factory is on Progress Ave, pretty close to Scarborough Town Centre. It's easier to get to if you have a car, but there's a Progress bus and it's not a terrible walk if you're feeling adventurous. It's totally worth it, plus Dad's cookies is on the way, so you can get your fill of cheap snacks and go home happy."}
{"text":"Delicious beef patty if you take a fresh baked one in winter time. No place to sit in the place. Generally buy a $5 pack with 12 patties and heated at home."}
