{"text":"So I was high as fuck last night at about 3AM and decided I wanted a pizza (in a shocking turn of events).
So since this was one of only 2 places open at this hour that would deliver to my house, and I've already had food poisoning from the other one, I blindly ordered this.
I was expecting some half-assed turd of a pizza to show up, but it was actually delicious. 
Just in case my judgement was clouded previously, I ate the rest this afternoon.  Still delicious."}
{"text":"It's a classic pizza delivery place, open late and cash only. Good quality crust that's nice and chewy, quality ingredients and they don't hurry the delivery so it always arrives cooked properly. 

Gets a 4 star as it's the safe choice  - there is better, but those places are eat in and usually busy always."}
{"text":"My favourite pizza place.

I have been getting the pizza from here forever, it is so much better than any other place around. Their crust is perfect not too doughy, just right! Tons of great toppings to choose from as well. 

I have always either ordered for delivery or ordered ahead for pick-up. The service os not so great here, when you call up what you hear on the other end of the phone is a very gruff GIGI! haha there are no niceties here.
Going in for a pick-up is a little scary I will admit, the place is frightening inside and the guys working in there are even scarier. They kind of look like they just got released from jail!!! they all stare at you when you come in (at least this is what happens to me) it's a little intimidating! Again no niceties it's basically what do you want! hahaha Pizza I think!

The last time I was in I'm pretty sure they were smoking while they were making the pizza, since this was all I could smell! It's no wonder I've never actually seen anyone eating in there.

As bad as this review may seem, I still say they make the best pizza and I'm willing to risk the scariness of it all! :)"}
{"text":"Okay, so they're one the only pizza places open really late and they deliver. That's great. But the pizza is bland. It has tasteless sauce, cardboard crust, and boring cheese. Go elsewhere unless there are no options."}
{"text":"BEST pizza in Toronto!!! Been ordering from Gigi's for years. Try the Sicilian...super thick crust with your favourite toppings and then topped with parm and garlic. Perfect for those Friday night comfort food sessions!"}
{"text":"Drop'd by this dive couple of days ago. 2 grey-haired, gnarly burn-outs behind the counter. Both have seen waaaaaaaay better days!!!! 

Pick the hot sausage slice. Politely ask them to just simply pop the slice in the oven for a quick re-heat.Repsonse . . . . 'it just came out of the over'. Yeah ok pal, there's 3-5 slices gone from the tray. Took  'touch test', yup, just as suspected . . . stone cold

Again standard request . . . ask to please cut slice in 1/2. After some serious attitude,, burn-out 2# pulls out the roller-cutter and does his thing. 

How these 2 has-beens survive the pizza game now days is waaaaaaaay beyond me. Shitty attitude, shitty pie (next to noooooooooo mozerella). No big suprise, rolled into their pad - prime-time (6pm) - place totally empty, heeeeello!!!!!

{"text":"Rudest people that can be found in Toronto but their pizzas are good enough so that people come back. Begrudge paying such unhappy, rude people but I do get a pizza from Gigi's once in a while and it's decent as far as pizza goes. When they are busy pizzas can take a while longer than they tell you. No apology of course. If you don't mind a complete lack of customer service or even friendliness, give Gigi's a try. If not, stay well away!!"}
{"text":"Just found out about this place two days ago. Phenomenal pizza and great customer service and punctual delivery. Have already ordered twice. Was always a Pizza Hut fan but after tasting Gigi, it's gonna be my new go to. Thanks for making my pizza experience a delight.  Cheers"}
{"text":"late night delivery, claimed it would take 45 mins to drive to my location (15 min drive), said cash only...ok, then I order a large pizza he cuts me off to say it's not worth it, laughs then hangs up. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Top 5 pizzas in Toronto hands down. We live in king city,but every time we're downtown,we try to hit gigis for a large gigi special."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!

Don't order from here. After an hour waiting for delivery I called and they explained they couldn't complete the order because the phone number was wrong. I asked what number they had on file and it was indeed my number. I had told them that I was watching for them as well and had seen no drivers come near our home. She rudely told me it would be half an hour for a new pizza and full price, and hung up on me. 

If you're looking for late night eats don't order here."}
{"text":"Long time Gigi client here but not anymore! The declining pizza quality and then the bad customer service I got last night definitely sealed the deal. I'd rather eat dominos.. online ordering and multiple payment options. And NO guilt trips when you realize within 2 mins you don't have cash! So much hostility. Bye Gigi!"}
{"text":"My cousin Tina and her husband Paul (who both attended U of T,  almost 30 years ago) were so enamored with Pizza Gigi, that whenever they have subsequently visited in Toronto, they have never failed to order a pizza from Pizza Gigi. They have sung the praises of this place to their children and many other family members for years and years. i call this deserved devotion."}
{"text":"Yum.

I have been looking for good delivery pizza for a long time, and I will probably never order from anywhere else again. 

I am a fan of thin crispy crusts too, but tonight it was the bready pan pizza that I was craving. My boyfriend and I were starving and ordered the #10 Sicilian, large. Mozz, parm and oregano. It arrived right when they said it would and it is massive and amazing.

I ate 2 slices and couldn't even imagine trying to scarf another. We still have a whole half pizza for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had from independent shop in town! Could be more adventurous with toppings but not if that means upping the high school lunch price. Thanks!"}
{"text":"New here in town and this was one of the first pizza delivery joints to come up on google

Ordered the 4 cheese and spinach large thin based pizza - wow . The cheese and the spinach blended perfectly with the thin crust and made for a delicious pizza enjoyed with a couple of cold beers , mixed in with some breaking bad it was a fantastic night in

Delivery was around 40 mins exactly as promised and the pizza was hot

Highly recommend, will definitely be calling again"}
{"text":"quoted at 40 minutes, arrived in 18. Price listed as $18 and showed up as $25 without tip. pizza was hot and alright"}
{"text":"Good pizza. It's definitely worth stopping here rather than across the street at the chain pizza place. I don't know the deal with Torontonians' obsession with chain pizza places. At least in this neighborhood you can skip them altogether. Hit a local place and you'll thank yourself later. 

Just remember Gigi is cash only. 1 slice = 2 actual slices. That's the culture in this area I guess... Every independent shop does huge slices and charges what would be acceptable for 2 normal slices."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great value! We really enjoyed the hot and fresh pizza. The mushroom pizza and black olive pizza were great with just the right amount of sauce and cheese."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Unfriendly staff. Deliciousness of pizza outweighs unfriendliness of staff."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, pizza! Amazingly, I didn't like (or even try) pizza until I was about 18 years old. It's still something I rarely indulge in, but when I do, it's *always* from Gigi. They make it just the way I like it, with the perfect crust, cheese, sauce, and generous toppings. Cash only for delivery, but they are fast and open late."}
{"text":"Ooooooy Gooooooy cheese and crust that you actually want to eat!


Thanks to all!!
Really glad I followed my fellow Yelpers advice on this place!

Was staying downtown with the family for a few days when one of my kids suggest we kick back at the hotel and order a pie!

After reading the reviews from the clan here, we decided to order a custom pie and WOW did Gigi deliver!!!!@

One of the best pizza pies I have had in a very long time! 
Well made with quality ingredients and even better flavor!!!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong.  The pizza is great.  But they literally told me they were too busy to deliver to me despite the fact that I was well within their delivery zone.  Horrible operation and customer service.  Will do research to find more reliable late night pizza after this ridiculous excuse for not delivering."}
{"text":"I visited Pizza Gigi late in the evening and got the pepperoni and mushroom slice. The pizza in the display case looked EXTREMELY dry and unappetizing but I ate here because I had no other choice at 10pm. They also lacked variety for those who enjoy protein/meat on their pizza since most were veggie. 

Truly disappointed in the quality of the dough and the slices had no flavour. I layered on spices, garlic powder and oregano to compensate for the cardboard-like texture of the crust and it's dryness. 

Not to mention there were 5 men working at this time (2 delivery men, 1 owner and 2 makers) who from what I could tell were rude to a customer on the phone, laughed and hung up. They were also discussing women lingerie models in a magazine while I sat right there. The vibes I got while eating there alone were not comforting and I wanted to hurry up and swallow this dry pizza ASAP. 

For the price you pay, you should try Blaze Pizza near the Eaton Centre or Pizza Nova right across from Pizza Gigi. Won't be coming back here when there are so many other better pizza stores in the Annex area."}
{"text":"Delicious Pizza , I like it so much 
And also good and fast delivery service !!!



Thanks a lot ."}
{"text":"Wow I just called for delivery and got turned down because of where I live, how can people say no to the $? Like I'm already paying a delivery fee.... I just want pizza!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is very average take out pizza. Really nothing special, not quite sure what all the hype is in BlogTO. They charge a premium for some toppings that are nothing to write home about. For example the sausage is some sort of pepperoni variant. Cash only FYI"}
{"text":"This is widely regarded as the best 4am pizza in Toronto, but in truth, it is the best pizza at ANY time. So what if they're drug dealers?! Being the pizza of choice for potheads is an accolade, not a liability."}
{"text":"Best Pizza Delivery I've had in Toronto.  A little more expensive if you like to pimp out your pizza like I do but totally worth it."}
{"text":"I read the other reviews and went ahead and ordered two pizzas; both were so delicious. The pizza ingredients tasted fresh and crisp. It was full of yummy aromas and not greasy at all. The large pizzas are slightly bigger than normal but perfect and filling for a family. They're also quick to deliver which is another plus! If you're wondering whether or not to order from here I highly recommend this place. Go for it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is so hot right now... Watch out for the XXL though - it barely fits through our door. 24 inches of deliciousness... Awesome pizza!"}
{"text":"A decent pizza place relative to the price. You can get a medium 4 topping pizza with tax and delivery for $22. The best part is that they do late night deliveries so if you are craving late night pizza, this is the place to call!"}
{"text":"Went there at around 9pm, ordered 2 slices of pizza. Felt like I was eating cardboard instead, so poor and disappointed. If you want pizza at night, go to Fresca or Blaze instead. Never again."}
{"text":"This is the only place my fiance will ever go for pizza, especially a late night one. 

For $4, you can 2 slices. I've actually never been inside and only waited in the car as most times it's super late and we're illegally parked. 

The pizza is divine - thin crust, every bite crispy and crunchy, toppings are not over powering (last night was pepperoni and mushroom). 

*finger smack*"}
{"text":"Best late night slice in town! I have been coming here for years as my late night munchies spot and always leave satisfied. I wish the prices hadn't gone up, but $4 or $5 isn't bad for a quarter of a pizza!"}
{"text":"To be clear, I am reviewing for delivery orders only. Done it twice, both times the driver was late. Pizza wasn't hot, but okay, I mean delivery does take some time and the pizza does sit so I understand. Got the super special and the margherita both of which tasted rather bland. Didn't really live up to the great reviews for me."}
{"text":"I'm torn between one and two stars. I used to avail myself of the 2-3 AM slices available at Gigi. Never really thought about whether it was good or bad pizza. Was in the area and thought I'd give it a try. Man, that is bad pizza. I did eat it regularly 20 years ago. But I never really liked it. Friends liked it. I didn't like the za. I didn't like the servers. It just was not comfortable or tasty. I thought I'd give it another chance. After 20 years of good pizza (including living in Italy), It's just not good pizza."}
{"text":"Whenever I get takeout pizza from anywhere other than Gigi, I feel let down; that's how bloody good it is. Great toppings, great crust; great regardless of your state of inebriation."}
{"text":"Ordered Pizza Gigi for dinner last night, and it arrived in 30 minutes, just as they told me it would.

It was still piping hot, and tasted delish. 

Love this place!"}
{"text":"This pizza joint is as good as any pizza joint could possibly get. Late night delivery and the most delicious, piping hot pizza I have ever had in my entire life - and I know my pizza! Would never dream of ordering from any other place."}
{"text":"Fantastic old school pizzas, reminds me of a NY pie. Crust is medium thin with a tender chewiness to it compared to those cracker crusts at big chains.  The sauce is bright and has the right hint of herbs and spice.  Right balance between crust, cheese, sauce, and ingredients.  Better to get a whole pie than a slice."}
{"text":"I usually stop here for a slice late night while Ubering.   The service has always been great and the food/pizza quality is the best by far.  I used to stop at Bitondo's but their slice quality has definitely degraded.  This is my new pizza stop!"}
{"text":"A beacon of late-night munchies salvation, 365 days a year.

Yes, that's right- GIGI is open till 4am every day of the year. In fact, you'll probably encounter the same fine gentleman toiling over the hot oven most nights of the year.

Gigi is in the \"upper crust\" of pizza joints, along the same line as Cora or Amato. I think Gigi is more renowned for it's slices than it's full pies. What separates it is it's insanely late hours.

Drop by for a slice some time at 3:37am!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here before and ordered many times. Not sure what happened tonight. when I called I was put on hold for 5 minutes. After I got through I placed my order for a half pepperoni and mushroom and a half Hawaiian pizza, before I continued the staff member said \"yeah... we don't do that\" ... I said that I've placed the exact same order many times to which he responded \"yeah... it's too busy tonight. We don't do that\" meaning 1/2 and 1/2 orders. I've worked in a high volume pizza shop before and the time addition is under 5 seconds... this just seemed ridiculous. I tried to find an email contact so as not to air this issue publicly but the owners need to know the quality of staff they have working. As for me, I hung up and called Papa Ceo. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"It's kinda of sketch looking, or maybe very sketch. I would have never gone here in my life if I wasn't on a \"pizza and beer\" hop through the city. I'm glad I stopped by!! The pizza is amazing, the crust is the perfect texture and it tasted amazing on its own. I had the mushroom, red onion and chicken (whatever it's called, seriously who am I to remember all these oregano shmeregano names...) and a 1/2 of veggie with peppers and tomatoes. I don't think it really matters what you get on it, the toppings were perfectly blended and unless you really really dislike eggplant or zucchini or something, all the slices will taste good. I'm prime example...veggie pizza? I've crossed over to the dark side...

The staff are fine, it looks like they feel at \"home\" and don't really care if you like the service or not. They seem kind of...strict? But I really liked them, no bullsh*t - just straight up quick service and no fake smiles. The lady cut my pizza rull good :)"}
{"text":"This review is based on two visits where I ordered the exact same thing each time. Double pepperoni, double cheese. The first time I'd have given it a 5 and I was so excited to order it again. This one I just bought it garbage. Barely any cheese and barely any pepperoni.  The crust was never that great but before when I got the toppings it was good. Tastes like cardboard and it makes me angry."}
{"text":"They dont deliver to the areas they say they do. Bullcrap."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were craving pizza last night and went online to find what was open at 2:30 a.m. and discovered Pizza Gigi is open until 4 a.m. We ordered a medium pepperoni pizza and a medium vegan (pineapple, olive, basil) pizza and they were both good. The pepperoni was a bit of a bland choice, next time I would go with meat lovers. But all around a good, late night choice."}
{"text":"Much like Joel O's review stated, I was also high as a kite when I ordered this delicious cheesy saucer carefully crafted by some dude probably named Steve. It did not disappoint. This incredible synergy of all of the four food groups satisfied not only my hunger but the restlessness of my very soul. 

tl;dr - order this pizza what are you even doing with your life"}
{"text":"Available anytime hunger strikes (for pizza) delivery 7 days a week until 4 AM!

The pizza is fabulous to boot, medium thin crust, with just the right amount of cheese and sauce, cooked to perfection.

Fresh toppings! Fresh Pizza!"}
{"text":"Good and fast delivery service, under 40 mins. The guy on the phone was efficient and talks pretty fast, but did not come across as rude as some of the reviews have said. The crust is quite \"bready\", almost like chewing on a baguette. The toppings are cheesy and gooey which is just how I like it. Over all pretty good considering how late they deliver."}
{"text":"This place is a joke and probably has the worst customer service of any pizza establishment in Toronto. After waiting an hour for our pizza to arrive the delivery man informed us it was cash only. This is not stated on the website and we were NOT told this on the phone. The delivery man called the restaurant and inquired what to do, the woman told them to take the pizzas back. The delivery man left with our dinner.  We called to inquire what had happened and if there was anothe option (what a waste of pizza) and the only other option was for us to go get cash from an atm. When we told her that would take 20 minutes, she said nothing and we received no apology from the lady on the phone or the delivery man. Will never order from here again or recommend it to anyone. So many other amazing pizza places in Toronto don't waste your time on this place."}
{"text":"Been eating pizza here for nearly 30 years.  The folks are a little rough around the edges, but come on, people! It builds character! Not everyone need be a corporate drone primarily concerned with customer relations.  As for the pizza, they've used the same recipes for decades.  Good stuff, especially after midnight.  I suggest the pepperoni and mushroom to cover the four basic food groups."}
{"text":"Worst customer and delivery service. And Pizza not so good. They take cash only at night."}
{"text":"GiGi is definitely the best pizza in Toronto during the wee hours of the night/morning.

They have fresh toppings and will make you pie before you sober up enough to remember the bite you're about to take is scorching hot (happens every time!)

The slices are decent but if there is more than one o' youz, I would recommend a fresh one made with the toppings of your choice. Worth the trip late night if you're craving pizza."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!! Expensive as shit to get delivered.   Had it delivered last night - one large meet lover pizza, and two drinks was $36.00, $40.00 with tip.  

But so good!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place 20 years ago, and as a night owl, they're open when others are not - but in recent years I've noticed the same thing every time I (made the mistake of) ordering from them - and that is the pizza has a REALLY weird taste to it.

I don't know what it is - but there is just something strange and 'off' about the flavor - and it's not pleasant.

And it's expensive."}
{"text":"We felt like this pizza was overrated.  Plus we got charged more than what was indicated in the website!"}
{"text":"I have a new favourite pizza from here! I have a new favourite pizza from here! Awooga!

Small Mediterranean: olives, feta, purple onions, tomatoes and spinach on their gooey mozza and perfectly balanced sauce for only 15.50. If you have a salad at home this size can be dinner for two.

Still cash only. Still not surprised."}
