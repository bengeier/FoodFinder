{"text":"Yes, I would have to agree with the first poster for this joint.  If you have a death wish, and also have developed a tendency to hang out with degenerates (young and old) and hillbillies, then this place is for you.  This place has plenty of cheap drinks, off track betting (on horses and greyhounds), and a free Texas Hold 'em Poker tournament nightly.  They have Blue Moon on tap, which is ok.  The bartender cannot for the life of her slice oranges for her cold beer.  Their appetizers were not on much of the flavorful side, but they serve their beers cold here.  I played in the Texas Hold 'Em tournament and finished on the final table, but did not win.  They are pretty nice people there.  The race book writers are pleasant and funny.  The guy running the poker tournament knows what the hell he is doing.  I will give it another try over here."}
{"text":"Went here and wish I never would have!  We only came in to play some pool and we had a FREE pizza coupon that we got from winning a poker tourney here. We ordered the pizza and the bartender said we had to either order a drink or get at least 1 topping for the pizza in order for it to be FREE.... Wait a minute... I now have to PAY for my FREE pizza that YOU guys gave me?? UNBELIEVABLE!!  Since our tab was only $4, they weren't exactly \"on-top\" of giving us our bill right away. We literally waited 20 extra minutes to get our bill!  We then found out that in order to pay for this \"FREE\" pizza with my credit card, it had to be a bill for $10+    What a freakin night!   I will NEVER go back and am now posting this so NOBODY else does!"}
