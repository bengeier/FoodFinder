{"text":"This is a great hotel bar that's inside but overlooks the pool. They serve cookies all day and breakfast in the morning. They have a light bar menu which is good because the restaurant closes between 2 and 5pm. The bartenders are really great and we had a wonderful time sitting at the bar and having a drink and a bite to eat. Pricey but great!"}
{"text":"The bartender was rude and seemed to be put out to be there. Total bummer because we are staying at the resort and hoped to have cocktails at night here with our friends. I think we will head out to town the rest of our stay.   Limited cocktail menu."}
{"text":"A decent happy hour option at the Scottsdale Resort at McCormich Ranch.  A decent lineup of beer and wine specials as well as appetizers at reduced prices.  Not a bad place to kick off the night."}
{"text":"The worst bar... don't waste your time here. Happy Hour prices are higher than normal prices at other great bars in the area. The bar fare was limited and didn't match the description on the menu. Service poor and pours poor! Our bartender acted like we were working for him. The only thing going for this bar is that it's in the SCOTTSDALE Resort at McCormick Ranch. A really nice hotel."}
{"text":"Our drinks were great. But the bartenders were super annoying flirting and cussing up a storm. They barely spoke to us and we wanted to ask them recommendations to eat for dinner. We are staying here for a week and won't be back to the bar. We ended up taking our drinks near the fire less \"gossip and being annoyed.\"   *matthew you are super annoying!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this bar is the patio view in the evening. They light a huge fire in the fire pit, and you can see the backdrop of the golf course and palm trees behind it...beautiful.  I was excited to see shishito peppers on the menu, but they didn't have that dish available during our stay. We tried the fried cheese curds, and they were fried to the point where the cheese had left the building! The shrimp and herb crostini were buttery and rich. Pretty perfect with the Hess Chardonnay. We also shared complimentary flat bread served with tart cherry jam and a tomato compote.  The food was decent as was the service. It wasn't a stand-out experience, but we left feeling pretty satisfied."}
