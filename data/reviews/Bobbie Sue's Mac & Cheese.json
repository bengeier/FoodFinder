{"text":"the staff seemed pleasant enough, until after a lengthy exchange in which I, as a first time visitor, asked about 3 or 4 of the options, and finally made my choice, was then told that the one I wanted they were out of :(  given the staff was at the station preparing another mac and cheese as we spoke, and it wasn't busy, I was very disappointed they didn't tell me up front what they were out of.

and more importantly, after waiting a few minutes while the food was in the oven, I walked the short 4minute walk home to eat a small $7 mac and cheese that was unevenly cooked. some bites were hot, others were lukewarm. if this is all you are selling, it would make sense to make sure the food is thoroughly hot?!

i like the concept and want to return, but not sure it is worth the money."}
{"text":"This place amazing! The green trees is my favorite. The wait can be a bit long but it's worth it."}
{"text":"The best Mac and cheese I've had: I had the small classic, and it's everything you would want a Mac and cheese to be. Salty, creamy, a bit peppery, with a crispy top. Such a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Service here was very poor. I asked the girl \"do you take debit\" and she held up the machine and said rudely \"what do you think this is for\" ... we waited 30 minutes for our order. A woman who was waiting before us asked why others who came after her were getting their food before her. As soon as she left with her food the same rude girl told another girl behind the counter \"oh my god that lady sucked\" loudly enough that everyone waiting could hear. When I asked why our order was not ready on time she said really impatiently  \"we only have two ovens\" as though it was an extenuating circumstance not their insufficient setup. Food was lousy. Half the pasta was dried out from not being covered in cheese while cooked."}
{"text":"A very lovely mac n cheese shop in the hipster Ossington Avenue. Interesting options apart from the classic mac n cheese, I ordered the Curry in the Hurry (curry, tuna and green peas), loved it. Went into a food coma after finishing the dish.."}
{"text":"After hearing really good things about Bobbie Sue's I was pretty psyched about trying their Mac and cheese. I have to regretfully say that it did not live up to the hype. I got the \"hamburger who lends a hand\" and it was pretty dry as there was definitely not enough cheese sauce. It was underwhelming to say the least.

Perhaps they were having an off day but regardless, I was massively disappointed."}
{"text":"We love Bobbie Sue's! Our first time here was summer of last year. We loved their classic, pulled pork and butter chicken. 
Stopped by here again last night for take out. We got the classic for our picky eater and he is still raving about it. Staff was friendly and helpful. We'll be back."}
{"text":"the mac 'n cheese from this place is absolutely heavenly. my single, solitary complaint is that they don't send any cutlery with their uber eats orders. do you want me to eat this mac 'n cheese with my bare hands like a barbarian, bobbie sue? is that what you want?! because god damn it i will. don't test me, bobbie sue. the mac 'n cheese is just that good."}
{"text":"Real cute take out spot, Gourmet mac and cheese! Super friendly staff, very nice decor. And super clean.
Can't go wrong with Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"As I was walking on Ossington in search of some dinner, I spotted a crowd in a take away stand. Then I saw the sign: Mac & Cheese. I couldn't help but to check out what they offer. $6 for a classic mac & cheese? 

The girl taking the orders seemed a little grumpy and frustrated, but  it didn't bother me too much as all I wanted was the creamy, cheesy pasta. I waited about ten minutes for my food, served in a dish within a pizza box. When I asked for a lid, they helped me wrap the dish in aluminum foil. 

I brought it home with me, heated it back up in the oven, and it was one delicious mac & cheese. Although I would have preferred a crispier top, the flavour, creaminess, and the texture of the macaroni was perfect.

If there was a spot like this back home, I am almost certain that this place would be a weekly stop.  Who doesn't love mac & cheese, served in under ten minutes? Up next on the to-try list: carbonara mac & cheese!"}
{"text":"Updated...
Another near closing time visit. Ordered the Classic again and this one was super bland. Lots of cheese melted on top, but the overall 

Original...
Went to Bobbie Sue's on a Friday night near closing time. 

We ordered the classic Mac and Cheese and it was great. Very cheese-y and very yummy! The spiral pasta was cooked to al dente perfection and the buttery topping added a pleasant crunch."}
{"text":"We shared the large Buffalo Blue Mac ($12.74) - kind of expensive for mac and cheese. Having said that, it absolutely satisfied the craving and was just a little bit spicy. Super greasy but super yum. I'd come back to satisfy a mac and cheese craving in the future!

It's primarily take-out with one long table downstairs in their storage area and some outdoor seating (which seems to be part of the coffee shop next door)."}
{"text":"I ordered the Carbonara mac and cheese off Uber Eats. Despite a 20 minute difference, the mac and cheese was still quite warm and good. I ordered the small ($8) and it was very decadent and filling.

I just personally didn't like the diced up pork on top of the pasta which is why it wasn't a perfect rating. Although flavourful, I found the pork really dry and just took away from the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I must admit I have a weakness for Mac and cheese. When I want to indulge judgement free I come to Bobbie Sue's for some classic home style Mac and cheese made to order. 

I always get the original though they have a vegan version also. Baked breadcrumbs top the unique pasta they use instead of the classic elbow macaroni. Sauce is on point and is a good match for the pasta. 

When I'm too lazy to walk here I know I can order online."}
{"text":"I've picked up from Bobbie Sue's and had it delivered via Uber Eats, and every time it's been great. 

My husband gets the Classic Mac which he claims is delicious, and I go for the Vegan Mac is also yummy.  I get the small size which is still a very generous portion.  The Vegan Mac uses Nona's cheese sauce, and I've tried to make it at home and it does NOT taste the same so Bobbie Sue's must be adding something special!  After plowing through a $7 jar for mediocre results, I'll stick with paying $6.30 & having someone else make it!"}
{"text":"If you could turn a warm snuggly Christmas blanket into an entree, this would be it. Bobby Sue's has succeeded in taking the best comfort food around, Mac n' Cheese, and cranking it up a notch with their own flair. Awesome flavors, big portions, and food as comforting as a Lazy Boy recliner by the fire make this one of the \"must try\" spots in the area."}
{"text":"babysitting my niece, my cousin and I were looking for a quick place to eat,
where the food was still delicious. We wanted to go to Bell but it was too much of a pub to go with a stroller and a toddler. 

We kept our trek up the street when my cousin remembered that he really wanted to check this place out, so why not stop in.

it's a cozy little play right, but it gets warm once you step in. they have a decent selection of flavours. I got the traditional Mac and Cheese and he got the one with the hamburger in it.

needless to say we were delighted with the size and quantity of the small serving. My niece really enjoyed it too, she ate more than half my serving :) 

id totally consider it comfort food!"}
{"text":"Came around 5 and ordered a buffalo chicken mac. Generous portion but the lady seemed sort of miffed and after tasting the mac and cheese, the price point of about $10 made it not worth. The cheese was heavy but bland and I got about 4 pieces of chicken. The chicken was good but seriously, 4 pieces?? 

Tdlr; tasteless and heavy, would not buy for the price"}
{"text":"This Mac and cheese place proved to be such a great decision after a long hike in the morning... they definitely don't cheap out on the cheese sauce and ingredients and everything is freshly made. we would come back in a heart beat if only they have one in markham. My favorite is their pullled pork... the sauce is great in cutting out the rich cheesy sauce... my friends really enjoyed the carbonara... would definitely come back if we were in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"After doing some yelping on what is around the Ossington and Dundas area, I stumbled upon Bobbie Sue's . So I made my way and I found out that the storefront is just off Ossington on Foxley street.

I ordered the large size carbonara mac n' cheese. The employee recommended the green tree, classic or pulled pork. I'm a fan of carbonara pasta in general so I had to try it. The mac n' cheese took about 5 minutes for them to make. It came in a box and I asked whether there was a dine-in area and the employee said either downstairs or the lawn chairs and benches outside. I opted to go downstairs since it was a chilly day.

The mac n' cheese was great. The texture and flavour were there but I found the bacon bits to be a little bit too salty for my liking. The saltiest of the bacon kind of ruined the entire mac n cheese for me. The noodles were pretty good as they were corkscrew shaped. 

Overall, I would come back again and try one of the employee recommendations and would not opt for the carbonara. 

PS: if you opt to eat downstairs, it feels like half a kitchen and half a storage unit. But it is nice of them to put a table down there even though it gave me a weird feeling."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!! The mac and cheese is out of this world, honestly. Def a must try!!!!
I got the pulled pork one and I absolutely loved it. Also tried the classic one and so tasty, cheesy and just awesome."}
{"text":"Have been 3 times now...the mac and cheese is awsome..
Just no where to sit so I have mine in the car.
Will be back"}
{"text":"I heard about this place through a friend and decided to check it out myself, since I was also craving for some mac and cheese. This place has no sit in area since the place is really small, just a heads up! But the menu had a lot of flavours that sounded really good. Got the carbonara Mac and cheese and pulled pork Mac and cheese and they were both delicious and filling. Got a small size but still thought it filled me up. The sauce for the pulled pork one tasted good also. Overall I think this is a pretty good Mac and cheese place to check out and would come back to try others!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. I've had the pulled pork mac quite a few times now and it was so delicious everytime. Perfect amount of cheese.  I've had the original mac and it was delicious on it's own. I have had the one with chicken I'm not sure exactly what the name was but it was also good, but my favourite is the pulled pork.. This place truly makes comfort food. If I'm in a less then great mood I put on my PJ'S, order from Bobbie sues and watch Netflix with my puppy. ( he is also a big fan of the pulled pork) . Eat here."}
{"text":"Great customer service, friendly peeps. Hamburger Mac n cheese tasted like a hamburger! Carbanora Mac n cheese was a little disappointing. Keep in mind we had 15 minute car ride home so they got cold :( not Bobbie sues fault. Good value. Would try again! With ketchup shhhhh"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this via Instagram 

A must try place! A very cute window store front. There are outdoor seating area right beside the store front. 

The large is the way to go, small portion is like snack size..."}
{"text":"Perfectly al dante pasta smothered in melted cheese... what's not to love? Cute take out place in a great location. Can't wait to try all the variations! Staff were friendly and let me know I could customize however I liked, as they are always made to order. The prices were totally reasonable. No space to eat there, but I saw an Uber Eats driver so you can probably get it delivered for extra convenience."}
{"text":"Some of the best mac and cheese I've had! Haven't had the chance to try every about but the classic mac is definitely my go to. Happy that's it's also opened until 12 am."}
{"text":"O.   M.   G.  !

Finally I had the luck to try this little gem hidden in one of the side streets of Ossington. 

If you happen to have an uncontrollable love for mac'n'cheese, this is the joint for you. 

Large variety of choices, all prepared on the spot by a team of super nice people that definitely know how to deal with customers. 

Every recipe comes in two size: small and large. Small if you are hungry and large if you want to share, if you either super-hungry or either you are gluttonous. 

What stroke me were three things:
- the pasta wasn't overcooked. Whoever does the cooking found the perfect way to cook ahead and leave the large amount of pasta sitting and ready for serving without having to eat playdough.
- the crunchy top: an absolute pleasure to jab with your teeth. 
- last but not least, the full flavour: well balanced so that ingredients don't overpower each other. 

A very enjoyable experience. 

You can take away or, if you'd like, there's a tiny little room downstairs where you can enjoy your serving of mac'n'cheese right away. 

Go and get one next time you crave for some. 

:)"}
{"text":"Bobbie Sue's is a macaroni & cheese lovers dream.

No indoor seating, but the ability to walk up to the window and get an order of macaroni quickly makes it perfect for a summer day (they offer 2 benches), eating on the go, or even taking food home. 

Could use a little more sauce, but otherwise great. The portions are also very generous for the price."}
{"text":"Our \"waiter\" didn't wash his hands after handling money and working the counter. We watched him make our food and manhandle it. Plus he got the order wrong. Pretty unappetizing. Plus they were not friendly. At all."}
{"text":"I'm  not a mac and cheese lover, but have always passed by this joint in this area.  Very straight forward menu and friendly service.  They have a set of muskoka chairs and a bench where you can sit if you go on an off-peak time.  I ordered the classic and thought it was delicious.  There was a nice crispiness to the top and have a great, not-too-over powering taste.  You can add condiments such as ketchup and hot sauce.  I couldn't finish mine and just reheated mine the next day and it still tasted fabulous to me!  I'm a leftovers kind of gal though!"}
{"text":"The blue buffalo chicken mac and cheese here is to die for. I've tried the classic, broccoli, and pulled pork variations, which also are delicious, but the perfect blend of tangy blue cheese sauce with the curly noodles and cheese hit a home run for me. If you are nearby (or hungover), come here and you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is my go to on Uber eats. Super cheap, super cheesy, super delicious!!! I only order the classic mac because I'm scared the additional toppings would ruin that's simply already soo delicious!!! I've also walked by it in ossington. Note: it's not a sit down enclosed restaurant, it's just a take away counter outside!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this restaurant by  accident but what a great find! Came to Canada for my cousin birthday and we were out all day doing \"touristy stuff\" We had a dinner reservation later on that night but we wanted something quick. We thoroughly enjoyed our mac n cheese, especially coming from the south. We  even came back the next day, though it was out of our way. Definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I had the buffalo chicken....... so good. Was baked to nice and crispy on top but soft and gooey on the inside. Cheese sauce tasted great, mix of flavors was great. The chicken tasted great as well, kinda like a rotisserie style flavor chicken, but it was scarce which was my only complaint, if they put more chicken I'd give it the full 5 stars because you can't really find Mac n cheese to this quality with the selection they have at many other places. I tried my friends vegan Mac n cheese and that was super tasty as well. I'm not even vegan but would order that for myself any day."}
{"text":"Pretty good mac and cheese, probably the best available on ubereats in my area. Would definitely recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"Came here pretty much for dinner appetizers. Service was great and quick. Parking was obviously difficult in this area, but food was delicious! We got the BBQ mac n cheese, which is quite large. It was way too much for an appetizer, but we devoured it quickly. The outdoor seating is cute, but very limited. There is one picnic table set up outside, but it's probably better to order this as take away, even though the mac n cheese would probably not be as hot when we you finally get the chance to eat it. We'll be back soon to try some of the other fun flavors, but the classic mac n cheese is hard to go wrong with--highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's about time Toronto has a place that only serves mac and cheese! I am actually surprised it took so long to happen, but boy am I glad it did! I am one those people who will order mac and cheese at any restaurant that offers it. And to now have a place where I have not one, but TEN options to choose from?! Yes, I am indeed in the mac and cheese fantasy land I always dreamt of. 

For my first glimpse into this magical land of mac and cheese, I decided to get the small ($5.30) Classic which is a 5 cheese blend masterpiece of ooey, gooey melt-in-your mouth cheesy divinity. It was comfort food at it's best, and I will surely be returning for more.

However, I would say the only downside to this delicious world of mac and cheese, is that 
they only have TWO vegetarian choices, ONE Vegan and ONE Pescatarian. Ideally, I think having at least 3 vegetarian and 2 vegan options is fair for a menu of ten items. But, the fact that they have at least 3 vegeprefarian options available is sill pretty damm good."}
{"text":"Best vegan mac & cheese in town! Great texture, good cheese, hmm good. Not cheap ... (And wish they could do it without disposable plate ... But that's Toronto restaurant code 's fault. )

Vegans of the world (or at least of the city): go !"}
{"text":"Cool vibe, good food and friendly service. We ordered the buffalo blue mac and the carbonara ($25 total)

Buffalo blue mac: I'm a big fan of buffalo & blue cheese and loved the idea of having it in mac & cheese form. The cheese hot sauce pasta combo was great however there was a little too much chicken in this dish for my taste. I would advise ordering a small unless youre extremely hungry or plan on taking some home. 

Carbonara: Excellent take on an italian dish however I wish I ordered the classic because this wasnt as close to a traditional mac and cheese as I waw hoping for. I like a lot of cheese and this was lacking that. If you are a fan of carbonara or alfredo pasta then this option would be great. 

When we return , we will try out the classic ($6 for a small) which I'm sure will be great!"}
{"text":"After some browsing on Yelp the other day, I decided to check out Bobbie Sue's for some fancy macaroni and cheese. I guess at this point, every other food has been \"up-scaled\", so why not that Canadian staple of mac+cheese. I guess I should have looked at the photos too, because this place was the dictionary definition of not-what-I-expected. It's basically a walk-up window with a small wooden lean-to built in front, and some plastic covering the open side since it was a cold winter evening. There were two Muskoka chairs and a bench under the lean-to, along with some plastic cutlery, so I guess most people take their food to go in the winter. (Apparently there is some seating downstairs, but I didn't check it out.) The servers were very friendly, and let me know that it would be about 6-7min for my food.

I had a small Blue Buffalo Chicken, which has chicken and blue cheese and Frank's RedHot sauce. It was very good, not too spicy from the hot sauce; it was steaming hot from being freshly made, which was good since I ate there despite the cold. The portion size was pretty good too, and there is a larger size for each option. Small bowls are mostly $6-7, and large $10-12. Other options available are the classic, curry, vegan and gluten-free. Overall, a very good meal, and I am sure to return to try some others."}
{"text":"I saw this place on BlogTO and went to try it. I can tell you that it is quite simply the best mac and cheese I have ever had in Toronto. I recommend the ground beef one.... so damn good."}
{"text":"Wandering down Ossington with a hunger in my belly, I stumbled upon Bobbie Sue's mac and cheese shack and decided that it was meant to be.

The premise for this place is pretty simple. What you've got is a take out window dishing out containers of gourmet mac and cheese. There are 10 options to choose from, including traditional cheese and vegetable based dishes, up to the ingredient topped options including hamburger, pulled pork, pancetta, and even curry with tuna to name a few. If you've read my Yelp reviews of the past, you may have noticed my affinity towards all things pulled pork, so my decision was simple.
After ordering, it took about 5-6 minutes to prepare before receiving my pizza box encased pie tin filled with tasty pasta. They have small ($5-$8 pre tax) and large ($8-13 pre tax) options, but as a hungry male I was able to crush the large without issue, so I'd consider them more like \"snack\" versus \"meal\" sized options as if I had've gone with the small I likely wouldn't have been so satisfied with my investment.

The results? Quite delicious. The pasta used, rather than traditional elbow macaroni, is a larger corkscrew shaped pasta sometimes known as Scoobi Doo pasta (Primo and ItalPasta both use this title, but the traditional name of cavatappi I believe also applies). Not only is the pasta cooked to perfection, but the larger noodles also means bigger forkfilled bites of pasta that also create smaller flavour divots which encapsulate your added ingredients for easier eating. The pulled pork had a good flavour, which rounded out the meal well. I'll admit that the pork was a bit tough and if it was in a sandwich would likely have disappointed, but mixed with the melty cheese and pasta the density of the pork actually worked to the combined results. Franks Hot Sauce is available at the counter as well, and I'll admit did add some extra flavour enjoyment. 

Random sidenote: I've always found it interesting to see whether people opt for a fork or a spoon when eating mac & cheese (using a spoon just feels right for me, which I think stems from many meals during college of eating Kraft Dinner straight from the pot with the oversized plastic cooking spoon as my eating utensil)... My recommendation with this place though, go with one of each. The spoon to help penetrate and cut up the crusty top layer, while using the fork to spear the meaty chunks within. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better places for mac and cheese in the city. Their sandwich board always caught my eye walking down the street so I finally went to check it out. Its a small shack with an order counter with only a bench with no table for eating. 

I got the small Carbonara Mac $8. You get to see them make it in the very small kitchen behind the counter and took less than 10 minutes to make. It had a good strong cheese flavour and the right amount of saltiness to make it really savoury. It needed just a bit more sauce but the toasted cheese on top made it good. Its comforting and satisfying. 

It was a cooler day but they had heaters inside their shack and was able to sit on the bench to eat quickly. They have a great selection of flavours and its a great place to pop by for take out. Would go back if I was in the area and craving mac and cheese"}
{"text":"This was so legit. I think it was the best mac and cheese I've ever had.
I have eaten a LOT of mac and cheese. My love of mac and cheese is beyond a hobby, it's an obsession.
It's affected my life in the following ways:
I no longer care about friends and family.
I've lost my home.
...just kidding but I felt about 5 bites away from that while eating Bobby Sue's mac and cheese. 
I had the carbonara while my friend had the pulled pork.
They were both so good! I think it's about $9-12 for a large, we both had a little bit left over.
There were so many foodora and uber eats food runners here. As there should be. It's damn good!
Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Cool little mac and cheese joint just off Ossington. Got a large which is quite filling.  They have a few different dishes to choose from including a curry mac and cheese. I did really enjoy trying this place out and would recommend it but at the same time I was really wow'd."}
{"text":"I can finally say I have had REAL mac and cheese. Bobbie Sue's puts every KD box you have ever had to shame. I am not a mac and cheese lover but Bobbie Sue's has made me come to the cheesy side. I had the Carbonara Mac & Cheese and it was the best thing I have ate in a LOOOONG time. I have been talking about this place for over a week now since I last had it...

I will be back Bobbie Sue's..I...will...be...back!"}
{"text":"I came here to try the food and the woman at the counter was so condescending that I turned around and left. Not a good way to get a new restaurant off the ground and in such a competitive area, I doubt this place will last to the fall."}
{"text":"Meh. If your drunk and need to fill the void then do it. Even then pretty dry and lacked seasoning."}
{"text":"Mac & cheese is like sex...even when it's bad, it's still not a bad way to spend the evening.

But for a place that specializes in mac & cheese, Bobby Sue's was disappointing.

My friend Ange felt the same way. We both ordered classic mac & cheese--which, by the way, the chick behind the counter explained was her personal favourite. \"Why mess with a classic?\" she asked us rhetorically. And we agreed.

But the mac was over-baked...too chewy and al dente for my taste. And the cheese was far from the ooey gooey goodness I was hoping for. Ange also rated it a solid \"meh\".

Sorry Bobby Sue! Maybe you were having an off night?"}
{"text":"I've never actually been into the place, but it's one of my go to's on Uber Eats. Who doesn't like good mac and cheese - and they offer some pretty interesting takes on it - personal favourite is the Buffalo Chicken, the Carbonara is also delicious."}
{"text":"Tasty comfort food but not a cheap eats place.  Don't know when the price went up but most reviews say it is $6 - $9 for the small serving and now the entry point is $8.
Still great mac & cheese with the noodles being cooked just right, tonnes of gooey cheesey-ness and a totally carbo-coma inducing calorie bomb though."}
{"text":"So, you don't eat here and then say, wow, that was the best meal!   
The reason you don't is because, well, ultimately it is just macaroni and cheese.   

You do eat here and say, wow, that is fantastic macaroni and cheese.  Bobbie Sue's has picked one thing and is excelling at it.  

I ordered a large traditional and it was crispy on top and gooey inside and was big enough for two meals. My personal preference leans towards more cheddar but that is just me. 

Would I eat there again? Maybe 

As a side, UberEats is the best thing in the world"}
{"text":"Such a cute little pop up restaurant! Came at the perfect weather to enjoy our mac n cheese on the patio:)"}
{"text":"We ordered a large Buffalo Blue Mac ($12.74). The wait for food was short and the mac came nice and hot. The mac and cheese was delicious. There was a good amount of cheese... it was just ooey gooey goodness. The chicken and blue cheese went well together. I would come back again and try their other menu options. 

As others have mentioned, this is mainly a take out place. There is a table if you go down the stairs located next to the cashier but it isn't exactly a dine in place as it's in the same room they store their food."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Standouts are the buffalo blue, pulled pork, and the green trees. Flavours are complex and the textures are perfect (soft and chewy on the inside, slightly crunchy on top). Service was fast and friendly and the portions are quite good. There is only one small bench for maybe 3-4 bums, so plan to stand or take your Mac and cheese to go."}
{"text":"Pretty solid mac and cheese (especially if you're looking to soak up some booze or grab something to take and eat in the park). It's a little shack off of Ossington that does takeout only, however there are some benches for you to sit on.

I've had the standard mac and cheese in the smaller size, which I considered to be fairly filling for lunch. I've also had the blue cheese and buffalo in the large size which was really good - you can definitely taste the blue cheese, skip it if you're not into blue. The large size would be good for dinner and you can realistically expect some leftover (or you could share it with someone).

Service has been good each time I've been there and I haven't waited longer than ten minutes for my food. Smaller sizes are around $6 and larger are around $11, which I think is reasonable for the quality of food."}
{"text":"This place had been on my bucket list for quite some time! Tried the buffalo chicken mac n cheese but opted for the traditional cheese blend vs the blue cheese. It was good, my only change would be that it had buttered bread crumbs on top. Definitely a place where you need to forget about the amount of fat and calories you're consuming. I think it would make a better side dish then a meal ;)"}
{"text":"You're walking down Ossington and suddenly spot what looks like a large shed made of giant coloured popsicle sticks. Out of curiosity you decide to walk a little closer. Next thing you know it's a food stall for mac & cheese. Delicious mac and cheese with a variety of toppings. I got the pulled pork and it was yummy. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Suuuuper tasty. I saw it touted as Toronto's first mac and cheese restaurant (which isn't true) and raved for the vegan option (which it deserves). Super cute place, nice location. 

Also love the selection. It's limited, but everything the group tried went over really well. We'll be back for sure. 

Only flag for me was that they have one small oven, so even with very few people there, the wait was reeeeally long. If there was some way to order in advance or more ovens for them, it would make the whole thing a ton better."}
{"text":"Good selections of Mac & Cheese. I even like their vegan Mac & Cheese! It is great if you can score some seating outside but seating inside or outside is a bit limited"}
{"text":"I ordered from uber eats very fast delivery, The noodles were done To perfection and not overcooked, The pricing is absolutely great and inexpensive, The portion sizes are quite large, The only reason why I did not get five stars is on their item broccoli and cheese Mac I did not like the spice they put on it was very hot, but everything else I ordered was fantastic, The vegan mac & cheese is probably the best I have ever tasted"}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable. Best vegan mac in town. The cheeze sauce is UNREAL  would recommend. Only suggestion would be to rename it The Mac Shack!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite place to get Mac & Cheese in the City. I highly recommend the Carbonara Mac & Cheese!! It is absolutely delicious. Too bad they don't have any seating as its mostly a pick up place. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"I love the concept, it's a pop out little shop with pizza box to go containers, but I'm the type of person that loves my Mac and cheese well... cheesy. I'm not a fan of the cream béchamel sauce which is the base of this dish, the only cheese I tasted other than cream was maybe a hint of something, I can't even give you the name because it wasn't that strong. Also I don't think the price tag reflects what I'm getting. Don't get me wrong this is great if you like that type of Mac n cheese, but I don't think the hype was worth it."}
{"text":"Terrible first experience.

I do not consume pork meat in any way or shape. As I don't eat pork, I am unsure of what Carbonara (Pancetta) is - it's not something of general knowledge. We got to Bobbi Sue's at around 9pm on Saturday, January 27th 2018. After inquiring about the vegetarian options and informing the cashier that I want something that includes no meat, I asked how the Carbonara is and was told its good by the cashier. At this point, I still don't know that it includes any pork meat (Pancetta). As I ordered it after inquiring, the cashier made no effort to inform me that my order includes Pork meat. As someone working in the food industry, you'd think it would be clear that I was looking for a Vegetarian option after informing the cashier about my preference.

If it were me on the other side? Something would click in my head - Why is this person, who just informed me of his vegetarian preference, now ordering something that has pork? I would immediately bring it up like other establishments have done for me and others previously - For example; \"By the way, this does include pork/nuts/etc\" 

I don't know how your Mac & Cheese taste as I felt sick after the first bite upon realizing I ate the pancetta bits. 

I brought your Mac & Cheese back to you the very next morning at 12pm when you opened and was turned down by 2 employees, 1 of which was the one who served me the night before. I made it clear I was looking for a vegetarian option and the reply I got was \"You ordered it, theres nothing I can do\" - I wasn't looking for a refund, I don't want my money back. I simply wanted to have a positive experience. I know many other stores that would have simply made me a new one - with or without any discount or money involved. The pasta was untouched. I was turned away without any apology.

Whether your food is amazing or not from previous reviews, without the right customer service training your establishment simply does not deserve business from me or anyone else."}
{"text":"I ended up here by accident, I was out walking with friends and saw this whole in wall. We approached and found that they did Mac & Cheese, we stayed. 

I had the pulled pork Mac & cheese and was not disappointed, it was creamy and cheesy and the pasta were done just right. 

I can say I'll be back and enjoyed every moment spent consuming the food. It's the best Mac and Cheese I've had in the city.  

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Cute little spot at the corner. Got the pulled pork mac n cheese and my cousin got the vegan mac n cheese. They come in two sizes, $7-8 to $12-14. 

There's some seating but not really a place you sit and eat -- mainly a take out joint. 

It was good and very flavourful. Would def have it again !"}
{"text":"went here for lunch as a recommendation from a friend. it's a quaint restaurant from its rainbow stripes walls and the cottage chairs. i shouldn't call it a restaurant but rather a mac & cheese shak because there's no dine-in; they have a few chairs out on the patio & food is served in a box. i was told that it's made to order so you can add or remove things. i got the small blue buffalo chicken with broccoli and came up to 10$. huge portion, it was creamy and rich and i tasted the blue cheese. however, there were only 4 pieces of chicken and i didn't take the Frank's flavour. good overall but I've had better"}
{"text":"This mac and cheese place is a solid 4 stars. The people who work there are friendly and will offer suggestions if you need. I ordered the blue buffalo chicken mac and cheese. I foolishly ordered a large forgetting how filling mac and cheese is so would definitely recommend a small. The chicken was like a rotisserie chicken so it was nice because it wasn't dry at all. The blue cheese and hot sauce flavours were there but not overwhelming which was nice. 

My only 2 minor issues were that because they are fairly busy I find it odd that they don't do a number or name system. I was waiting for quite a while for mine (my friend had finished eating and I still hadn't gotten mine) and it turned out someone had accidentally taken my order thinking it was their own. You can't help but think the name system would avoid that. The people working were apologetic and I don't blame them at all for the mix up but you just wonder why they don't use numbers or names. 

My other minor issue was they were out of ketchup. Any mac and cheese place should have unlimited ketchup!

Other than that the food is good and there is a nice wooden bench area right beside it. I would eat here again and just keep a closer eye on my order!"}
{"text":"Bobbie Sue's is an awesome mac & cheese shack that stands near the corner of Foxley & Ossington. Rumour has it that this place was named after a cow. Whether that's true or not, it would be no lie to say that this place serves the best mac & cheese in town.

There aren't too many concepts like this in the city where you order from an actual takeout restaurant and eat right on the spot if you wish. Since opening up last year, they've added walls to the structure, as well as air conditioning and heat to keep you cool or warm (depending on the weather). It's like street food meets takeout, but neighbourhood style.

Must-try pies:

Classic Mac
Blue Buffalo Chicken
Carbonara
Hamburger Who Lends A Hand

Each order is prepared on the spot, right in front of your eyes. I haven't tried a menu option that isn't stringy, loaded with cheese, appetizing, and cooked to perfection (I've got at least 5 more flavours to try). The newness of this place doesn't wear off, I promise. They're conveniently opened 7 days a week, until midnight. If you haven't tried out this slice of comfort food heaven already, don't delay."}
{"text":"Edit: They now have a Beef & Mushroom Mac that's to die for! 

Came here on a cold day, noticing that it's set up like a take-out window, but finding that there is indeed limited indoor seating in the basement. I tried the regular and the pulled pork mac and cheese, which is essentially the same minus the layer of pulled pork and BBQ sauce on top. The mac and cheese itself was very good and not overly cheesy."}
{"text":"More of Quebec's great gastronomy in Toronto! From the same French Canadian owners/brothers of Poutino, New Age comfort food is establishing itself in Toronto. Bobbie Sue's serves exclusively mac and cheese, and not just any type: the ol' cheddar one is offered of course, but nothing beats the reinvented recipes of this classic. There is even a vegan version available, complete with vegan gravy and cheese bought from a local producer. Small sizes run at $7, while the bigger ones are at $12: if you have a decent appetite, the small serving is well enough. All orders are served in a poutine-like aluminium container, nested in a custom-sized pizza box: practical for takeout! 

Would come back for the inventive recipes since prices are fair, but some might find the travel time a little long from downtown core."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal supporter of Bobbie Sue's since almost the first day it opened. I love mac and cheese and will follow it anywhere. And I love that here I can get it in a little take away box and bring it to the park* or just sit on the bench and scarf it down right away. For this reason I normally get the small size mac, not wanting to be overstuffed before I get on my bike and ride away. 

But I've recently made a discovery I would like to share. 

While delicious fresh, Bobbie Sue's mac is perhaps even more delicious heated up the next day. I recently got a large because I was starving, but then couldn't finish more than half. I took it home and stuck it in the oven the next day and it was just as good if not better. The sauce had melded even more with the noodles and the cheese got even crispier. Yum. 

So next time you're not sure whether to be a glutton and get a large or not, I say go for it and thank me later. 

*Did you know that if you are in Trinity Bellwood's you can Uber Eats Bobbie Sue's to the park? Just make sure you are in clear view of one of the houses or businesses along the edge of the park (e.g. the east side near Gore Vale). Give the address of the house but in the notes section ask them to call you on arrival. Then just trot over to meet them in front of the house when they call. It's a game changer."}
{"text":"Here, you don't have to break the bank to have a delicious meal. I'm a Mac and cheese lover and this place delivered. I've tried most of the options on their menu and have yet to be disappointed. If you like Mac and cheese, just go. Generous portions and good service.  They only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it's not the easiest place to find and the girls serving could be a little more personable."}
{"text":"This Mac & Cheese is so fresh and juicy you would think they just milked the cow in the back of the shack. You can definitely see that they use quality ingredients - no doubt you paying for quality."}
{"text":"OMG why is this so far from my home, I would be there every day and get super fat and be totally okay with that.

This place is adorable, super suited to the \"Ossington Strip\" 

I had the small broccoli and chilli one... Super stoked on this. It wasn't a bad price for the amount, I don't think I could have eaten the full large. Had just the right amount of kick with the chilli and the macaroni itself was amazing! Great use of cheese. 

My partner grabbed the large pulled pork. It was seasoned just right and the pork was scrumptious and yummy. It was super fresh and well worth it.  For 8 dollars it's a pretty good deal considering you go to any sit down place and get the same thing for 12-14 dollars usually. 

I will definitely be back for more and more and more."}
{"text":"I love you, Bobbie Sue. 

Tonight my favourite guy and I took an evening stroll to our friendly neighbourhood mac and cheese stand, and it was everything we'd hoped it would be. No matter how cold an evening, when you're buying your supper from a wooden kitchen stand, you're instantly cozy. 

We got their traditional mac and cheese and their bend on Hamburger Helper. Both were delicious, especially the hamburger one. Hamburger, mushrooms and gruyere mixed together make for one hell of a comfort food cocktail."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love some good ol' Mac and cheese? 

I had heard about Bobbie Sue's via word of mouth. I immediately used the Google machine to check out their menu and instantly fell in love. 

Buffalo Blue Chicken... Pulled chicken, blue cheeses & Frank's hot sauce... Colour me ecstatic! 

The magic creation lived up to the hype and paired wonderfully with my Bellwoods Brewery beer. 

I can't wait to go back again. Especially because the menu is filled with so many choices and the service was prompt & friendly. 

ALL THE OMNOMNOMS."}
{"text":"Bobbie Sue's Mac & Cheese may be the ONLY mac and cheese shop in all of Toronto and is similar to NYC's S'mac shop. Bobbie Sue's is in West Queen West and opens at noon with a line already forming before it opens. Despite that, the line moves fast.

Most customers are people who work nearby getting their food to go. If you're here to stay, there's one long table downstairs that is easy to miss. 

The food is good! If you're eating for one, order the small portion. It's the perfect size for a meal for one. I ordered the BBQ pulled pork mac and cheese and it was really good with a perfect ratio to pork to noodles. 

The only complaint is their lack of extensive menu. They offer only 8 or so versions of mac and cheese and their flavors aren't very bold."}
{"text":"my review, and everyone elses review of this place, will not do it justice. 
whats more canadian then mac and cheese? well poutine of course...! 
but mac and cheese is a good second option, but this resturant should not be an option. 
the first time i went here, honestly, i got lost, i almost walked down to queen st because i didn't see the business on the actual street. this place is tucked very much away from ossington ave, in a little shack on the side of the building. but don't let this shack make the opinion for you, i ordered three different small Mac and cheeses, and every single one of them blew me completely away. this is some serious comfort food. in the winter they have electric heaters in place which cooked the back of my neck as i was standing in line. i was going to a concert the night that i went to this place, and i was so impressed with the food, that i actually brought a few members of the lead band to come back and get food. 

were all in agreement: best mac and cheese we've ever had in our lives.


the only negatives they have is that they don't have a \"proper place\" no seating at all, and its a bit confusing to get to."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and don't think I'll be back.

The sweetness in the BBQ sauce is really good but for the price they charge I could make something even better at home.

$17 (inc tax/tip) is not worth the value."}
