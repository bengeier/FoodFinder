{"text":"Mmm... gyros, kebabs, curries, tabbouli and rice pudding!  One of my favorite lunch places in downtown Cleveland.  Fast, friendly service and have never had a single bite that wasn't delicious.  

Always get curry sauce or yogurt sauce if offered.  Also, get a punch card.  You will be back."}
{"text":"Best lunch in Cleveland. I have enjoyed kebobs from literally around the world. Greek Express hangs with the best from Europe. I suggest picking a book up from the library running across the street to the arcade getting a kebob and taking it back to the librarys outside reading area. Enjoy the food while enjoying the shaded area and read a book for dessert!"}
{"text":"I work within walking distance, so I have been here many of times. Located in the Hyatt Arcarde, there are several other choices close by but this is my favorite. I'm not being byass because I'm greek, I'm being honest because they are friendly and authentic. The owners do operate this business and they are always eager to assist and happy to help with suggestions. 

The gyro's are pretty good. Their not from the shawarma, but they are still good in their own right. I do enjoy their tahini sauce, I get it on everything. Not too garlickey, which is a nice touch since I go on my lunch and wouldn't be able to eat it if it was. The salmon (Friday lunch special) is good also. The chicken kabob is all white meat chicken, I get the spicy and then have them add curry sauce and tahini sauce and load it into my pita and I'm in heaven. The rice, not my favorite. I substitute for the greek salad with real feta, which makes everything betta. 

Based on the low $5 price tag, the quality of food, the friendliness, cleanliness and the quickness, this place is a five star establishment all day. Thank me later."}
{"text":"I love me some good gyro action. This place did not disappoint. This place was located in the Arcade down town and man was it delish. 
I had the potatoes with lemon sauce and a nice stacked gyro. The meat was tender, the potatoes were amazing and all I can remember was devouring the whole thing. I look forward to coming back"}
{"text":"This place was a lunch staple for me when I worked downtown. They had a rotating special, like chick pea curry or some kind of mixed vegetable curry. Always delicious. The spanikopita blew my mind along with the rice pudding. It was so thick and had a hefty dump of cinnamon on top."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this restaurant more often, but haven't been here in a while.  This place was always consistently tasty. and this visit didn't disappoint.   I ordered that day's special, which was the Chicken Kebab with rice, pita bread and I ordered a side of tabouli.   The Kebab was nicely seasoned, tender and tasty.  The rice was draped in curry sauce and topped with yogurt sauce.  The bread was warm and soft and the tabouli is more greek than the traditional lebanese, containing cucumbers and chickpeas.   I'll definitely have to frequent this place more often!"}
{"text":"Chicken kebab with curry sauce, rice & pita. Not bad for $5.50."}
{"text":"If you work downtown, I'm sure you're familiar with the lack of options when it comes to acquiring a gyro for lunch, but at Greek Express, you'll find your best bet (or at least mine) for the mouthwatering meal done right. The gyro itself isn't that big, but what they lack in quantity they definitely make up for in quality. The meat is plentiful, succulent, and delicious. The pita (naan?) is top notch. They have just the right amount of veggie toppings, and the sauce, although thick, is flavorful. They also have kebab dishes, curries, spanikopitas, and samosas. These were all very amazing.
 
Located in the Arcade, it's not too far away from most downtown workers as long as you're willing to walk a couple blocks. It has seen a bunch of other businesses, such as Lelolai, the crepe place, and the generic Chipotle, come and go while still standing strong--and with good reason. They serve quality food very fast and at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Located in the Old Arcade.  They have great Greek food, including gyros and spanakopita.  They also have Middle Eastern favorites including curry dishes and chicken kebabs.  Their rice pudding is better then my Mom's!

Make sure to get the 'punch card' you will want to come back."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty lunch for an extremely low price. While their portion sizes aren't that large, you can make a nice meal out of it. Great homemade hummus and gyro meat, solid baklava and a solid salmon special. It's a nice spot to have downtown."}
{"text":"This is one of my default options for lunch downtown when I have no idea what I want. I point myself to the door and go where my stomach takes me, and this is definitely a frequent stop. Lots of good vegetarian options, a killer spanakopita, and a lovely chicken-lemon soup keep me coming back. Prices are more than fair, it's run by nice people, and service is efficient, even when there is a line out the door."}
{"text":"I was going to express myself on Greek Express with 3 stars but I decided they merited 4 stars in consideration of how tasty it was, how reasonable it was and how fast it was.

98% of the time the quote, \"Cheap.  Fast.  Good.  Choose Two.\" holds true but in the case of Greek Express, they hit all three.  

A bonus is that they are in the Old Arcade, a gem of Cleveland architecture if ever there was one.  If I'm downtown, any excuse to soak up the vibe here for a little while is a good one.

Oh, the food?  Three of us shared a salmon special with salad and rice, a gyro sandwich and a hummus appetizer.  It was plenty of food.  Their hummus was slightly runnier than I'm used to but packed such a garlic zing I wanted to dip everything nearby into it and eat it.

At first the salmon looked like it was overdone but it turned out to have a nice caramelized crust on it and the interior was tender and delicious."}
{"text":"Let's get something straight.  Greek express is not entirely and purely Greek.  It features delicious Indian and Greek lunch foods at a fantastic prices.  In fact, it actually improves upon Greek cuisine (who knew that was even possible) by serving their gyros on lovely, fluffly, hot, freshly baked naan.  Sometimes you have to wait a minute so they can pull the naan off the grill.  Heaven.

Each day Greek Express serves two specials, usually some variation on a curry, rice and naan and a kabob/ naan/ rice special.  On Wednesdays, they feature moussaka.  Their everyday fare consists of juicy lean chicken kabobs, spanikopita, greek potatoes, some sort of veggie curry, tabooleh salads, baklawa and rice pudding.

All of it is really fresh, brightly seasoned and fantastic.  Pretty much everything rings in under $6, so your pocketbook feels as happy as your stomach!  It's a mom-and-pop operation.  Both Mom and Pop are very nice and personable.  Don't be afraid if there is a line out the door.  It goes very, very fast!

And the answer to the ubiquitous \"Yogurt sauce on that?\" is \"Absolutely!!!!\""}
{"text":"I have been eating lunch at this little take-out place about once every other month for the last 10 years and every time, I wonder why I don't come more often. The food is really delicious and the service is always very friendly!

The favorite (and one of their most popular) dish is the chicken curry kebab - chicken and peppers over rice with spicy curry sauce and yogurt with a delicious fluffy pita. The same order with cauliflower instead of chicken is also really tasty. The tabhouli (sp?) salad is also delicious and super garlicky. Yum!

A typical lunch without a drink is under $6, which is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Pretty cheap Greek food but decent. The gyros seemed fresh and were decent. The dressing they use on the sandwiches and salads is delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious option for weekday lunches downtown. It's super crowded at the peak lunch hours (as is everything around downtown), but the line moves fast. If you go after about 1:30, the line has usually died down, but you risk not having as many choices as if you brave the crowd.

They have yummy Greek and Indian food choices and it's ridiculously affordable. Their spanakopita is by far my favorite thing on the menu. It comes with potatoes (also delish) and I always get their awesome yogurt sauce on the potatoes (YUM). I've also often gone just to grab a container of hummus to keep in my fridge. Super fresh and super delicious. Their warm pita is awesome, but since they heat it there, I usually just grab enough for whatever I'm eating right then and there. I saved one for my hummus later and it just hardened and got awkward. 

The owners/employees are so friendly and efficient (I mean really, the line moves fast thanks to them). 

Like most of my favorite small lunch spots downtown, they're only open during lunch hours on weekdays, so unfortunately, I can only enjoy this when I have a weekday off or work evenings. Wish they were open more - so yummy!"}
