{"text":"Last Sunday, I went to this place because someone recommended it to me. Its location on Church Street is great but the actual place is horrible. :( The worst food I ever ate!!! The chicken tikka masala was cold, dry and inedible. I personally can cook better! The waiters? Clueless about everything and very slow service....It is obvious that nobody cares about anything. Totally disappointed with this restaurant! It was a bad choice to eat here. That's why, I would never go to this place. My first visit is definitely my last!"}
{"text":"I never noticed this restaurant (although I walk by it every week) until recently, when a friend from out-of-town recommended it! Unfortunately, I'm on a gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, etc. elimination diet; it wasn't the best option to go here, but as I wanted to spend time with my friends, I obliged.

I did specify my dietary requirements and ordered Avocado Chicken. I don't think they made it soy-free after all, but the dish was pretty tasty. My friends were happy with their dishes. They offer brown rice which is great. The prices seemed fairly reasonable. The service was quite slow that night, although it really wasn't very busy.

Overall, just getting an OK nod."}
{"text":"The signage makes it pretty clear that this is not an authentic Thai place, but what do we care? We want americanized pseudo-thai food.

When I stepped into the restaurant, I waited to be seated, as per the norm in most restaurants. Another party followed us into the restaurant, and asked if we were waiting for something....

uh...yeah, we were waiting to be seated.

I still haven't figured out what the expected behaviour is. Whether the people behind me were being impatient and rude, or I was supposed to seat myself, it shouldn't have been ambiguous. If patrons are to seat themselves, there ought to be signage that indicates this!

We picked a seat at the back of the restaurant, which warranted lots of privacy, but no service. Parties that arrived after us received their food way before we did.

The food was okay. Generous portions, decent prices, reasonable presentation. I ordered green curry with beef. Is it normal that a bowl of rice is priced separately? I'm not quite sure what anyone would do with just a bowl of curry. The beef was tender, and there were lots of veggies in the curry. Although I certainly don't know the nuances of authentic thai food, it was tasty, flavourful and enough for two meals."}
{"text":"If I can rate a negative number, this place is -10. I couldn't believe how horribly slow the service here is. This is the second time I have ever walked out of the restaurant. I couldn't believe that after sitting down for 45mins in the restaurant, my appetizer still didn't arrive. I stumbled here at about 8:00pm. When I walked in, the hostess/server asked if I'm here for a pick-up or take out. My eye brows just rolled up with confusion. I thought this was a restaurant. Shouldn't they ask if I wanted a table instead? Shouldn't they be promoting their dining service instead of their take-out service? I should have known that was a clue. So when I told her, I'm here to sit down, she was baffled. Was I dressed inappropriately? Was I supposed to hear a suit and a tie in this place? Was my Club Monaco sweater, Zara jeans, and dress shoes too casual for this establishment? Or was I supposed to be Anglo? I'm freaking Filipino if one might ask. Finally she understood what I said and she politely suggested to me to sit down anywhere I want. So I sat almost to the far back corner since that was the only table available. I felt bad since it was for a table for 4 and I was by myself. But then again the place was dwindling down other than the group of ladies who seem to be having a great time. They were loud but it didn't bother me other than the occassional shreaking and Lezzie harking. So I sat down and the male server came over and cleaned the table. Then 2 mins later, the female server/hostess came over to clean the table. I just gave her a smile and told her that the other guy already took care of it. With that attention, they gave me a good impression in the beginning. Then it took about 5mins for the waiter to come back if I wanted anything to drink. I asked for a half bottle of the house cab and also as a starter, I'd like the coconut shrimp. I'm not ready yet for the main course. He politely obliged and walked away. Then he brought my cab but didn't pour me a glass. So I had to pour it myself apparently. While enjoying my wine, I opened up my Kindle to read a book. That is my normal date when I am on a business trip. Fine dining or casual dining, my Kindle is my date. I read and read. And read and read. Poured myself another glass of wine and read and read. I looked on my watch and 40 mins has surpassed. So I prarie dogged my head to try to get the waiter's attention. But he was busy with the touch screen teller machine. The female server noticed me and must have notified my server. So he came over and right away before I even opened my mouth, he goes \"I'm so sorry but the kitchen is really busy with take-out orders, yours should be out any minute\". It didn't hit me and I said, \"oh, ok\". But then, I realized...wait a minute, I've been here for almost an hour, ordered my appetizer and 40 mins later, it is not ready???? That just didn't make sense. So I tried I brushed it off and continued reading my Kindle book. After ready for about 5 mins, the coconut shrimp still has not arrived. I was just perturbed. So I stood up, put $10 on the table for my wine, put my scarp on, grabbed my gloves and told the server that I'm just going to take my business elsewhere. I cannot believe that it's taking awhile. Instead of being more apologetic, he just responded with an \"okay\" and continued on with cleaning up the rest of the tables. At this time it was only me and the group of ladies that were there. The restaurant was half empty. I was pissed then. I turned around and grabbed back the $10 and said, \"you know what, you do not deserve this.\" and I walked out."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. I ordered a Malaysian fried rice (not even a Thai dish)... The rice was dark green... Pretty sure they used stale basil to make it. Oh lets not forget that it was bitter! My friend ordered a pad Thai, and it was soggy with sauce, which tasted like BBQ dipping sauce. The server couldn't even tell the difference between two of our fried rice, even though one was green and another was red... Overall DO NOT go here. It cost me 15$ for one rice dish that I took two bites from."}
{"text":"I went in because of their decor. The place is very nicely decorated, which isn't the case for many non-mainstream restaurants (like indian, thai, etcetc.) The staffs were nice, the location very easy to find, but omg the food. It was okay, but my boyfriend can cook better (that's not dissing cus he's a good cook.) I didn't think the food was bad but it wasn't the level I was expecting. It LOOKS good, but the actual flavor lacks. The rice was soggy one side and very grainy on the other. I don't know how that can happen. The CHICKEN SATAY OMG it was horrible. The chicken was dry and the sauce was pretty bland. This place needs more quality control. Probably won't go there again."}
{"text":"Four of us ate here last week.  We order 5 different dishes.  3 of them tasted exactly the same on different shape plates.  The other 2 dishes were dreadful. 
There are tons of great Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto any of them would outshine this one by miles."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times due to convinence. 

pros
huge portions
very cheap
works with tasteaway so u can double up discounts

cons
quality is not the greatest. 

overall

not bad for cheap eats."}
{"text":"I walk by this place often and thought why don't I try it.  Big mistake.

The fact that it was empty at dinner time should have been a clue.

I can't remember the name of what I ordered (and am thankful that it is fading from my memory).  The rice was hard, uncooked!  The waiter did not seem surprised at this, but informed me that there was no more rice available, without offering a substitute of any kind.  The stir-fried veg were tiny and unrecognizable, as was the mystery meat which was supposed to be beef.

Looking around later while waiting for my bill, I realized that the restaurant was dusty and dirty, especially the window sills and carpet, table and chair legs.  Grimy and disgusting.

Service was okay but apathetic - nothing was noticed unless brought to the attention of the server.

It is very clear that nobody cares about anything in Just Thai, therefore my first visit will have to be my last.

After wasting nearly $20 in this place, I left to go and eat somewhere else.

{"text":"The worst THAI I have had in a long time. not what it has used to be, food is un appealing and never looks fresh."}
{"text":"I don't know why people are being so hard on this place, although I must admit I've only tried two dishes and only really enjoyed one. I have been twice and have enjoyed the red curry with coconut rice - yummy! My wife ordered the veggie pad thai both times and she enjoyed it, but I can't vouch for it's authenticity. It's average, so not the best, but definitely not the worst. 
Service is fine, food is nice and I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love the Chicken Pad Thai, it's some of the best I have had. I come here every couple of weeks and pick up an order to go , and that one order does 2 of us. I can't speak to the service as I  don't stay, but they always seem to have new staff every time I go. And to the reviewer who didn't care for the customers who were \"lezzies\", this is in the heart of the gay village -- if you don't like gays and lesbians then don't come to the restaurant."}
{"text":"The only thing memorable about this place was the server who had extremely antsy behaviour, talked a mile a minute, had shifty eye contact, could barely keep still or get our order right. Completely off putting and unprofessional. Never going back. I don't think I remember the food."}
{"text":"I'm confused why some of these reviews are negative. I'm from out of town and am obsessed with Thai food. This is one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever had. Everything was so flavorful and the sauces were all a delicacy. I'd recommended this place to anyone. Even the iced tea was superb. The service was good too."}
{"text":"People should know this place has new management and should give it a try. We had chili chicken and butter chicken here. The best food. Also they have a small bar which has a lot of choices"}
{"text":"Went there during Pride. Changed the menu, raised the prices. But when they WATER down the Beer!  That's when I spread the news!"}
{"text":"Worst meal I've had in a long time. Tough, chewy mussels and the crispy fish main was horrible, dry, bland and inedible. Total disappointment, its like they served a Thai frozen microwave dinner to us."}
{"text":"Less than average Pad Thai with only two prawns. Green curry was ok. Service was friendly but the server was invading our space a bit too often.
Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I found this place to be okay,
I ordered a chicken dish which failed to explain that it would be breaded deep-fried chicken. The description should of been more clear, then I would have changed my mind to something else. After that I haven't been back yet."}
{"text":"They call themselves \"Just Thai\", literally. That is the NAME of their restaurant. Then why would they have Indian curry dishes on the menu? And why would the chicken curry dish I ordered have breaded chicken? Never in my experience of eating Thai food have the curry or sauteed dishes consisted of a breaded protein. Kindly, they took the dish back and made it without breading. I have to give them props for that. 

(It's only happened once before where I ordered a sauteed dish that turned out to be breaded chicken and they threw a fit when I sent it back. Fuck me right? Then put it on the goddamn menu.)

Anyway, rice didn't come with the dish so that was an extra charge. Fine. It was Coconut rice and it was delicious. The dish itself was an interesting combination of curry and coconut milk with mango and avocado. And as the Mussels appetizer was delicious, it consisted of a lot more vegetables than I expected and fewer mussels. But the mussels were huge, so I guess it evens out. 

It's not terrible food, but it's not traditional Thai."}
{"text":"Never order delivery from this place.

 I live not too far away from them, and after an hour and a half of waiting ( when the wait time is supposed to be 20-30mins), I had to phone and ASK them what was going on. To which they responded; \" Oh.. oh yeah. You did order something\". Not even an apology.

  And the two times I decided to order and pick up, when I got home, they always get it wrong. And I always have to go back. 
 Their food isn't too bad when they get it right. But it's always a gamble. You have a 1 in 5 chance of mistakes, failure to deliver, or incredibly soggy soup-like coconut rice. 
  I've given up on them after my last experience because I sometimes I just want food delivery to go as it's ordered with no problems. And as for takeout, I dont want to have to phone them, tell them the order is wrong, or weird- and have to go back.

 It could be a nice restaurant if it weren't for such stupid things."}
{"text":"Highly unethical, serving expired meats.  It doesn't matter what you order (chicken, beef, pork or seafood) because they all look and taste the same anyway.  Unless you're very desperate or no other choices, you have probably tried them all by trying one bad dish. 

Their services are not impressive either.  Forget about this restaurant or good luck!  By the way, I actually want to offer no star.  It seems one star is the minimum.  Okay... okay... you have it... here you go... one star..."}
{"text":"I like the flair to the dishes and the customer service is amazingly great here. It is not authentic, but it doesn't mean it isn't tasty. I had classic Pad Thai, but it was not that classic, it had added sauces which was great at first, but then seemed to be too rich by the end. I switch with my boyfriend at the end to the glass noddles dish and I liked that better."}
{"text":"Just ordered there for take out, and meh is about right.

Uber watery sauce that hinted at flavour.  It wasn't awful but it's kinda like trying to get to an itch by blowing on it.  It's something, but ima still itchy.

Food was fast, and cute bartender was friendly."}
{"text":"The previous visit I thought this place was okay. But after my latest visit, I will not be returning. I find the food to be mediocre, and there are several other similar options nearby that I could go to for the same price point.

This visit, I came with a group of 4 others. Someone ordered a Rickard's or Keith's Red. As we were watching, the beer head was scooped out with a spoon? Then, he got served some sort of pale ale. When he pointed this out, the server didn't want to believe him, but still replaced the drink. When she was pouring him the right beer, she once again skimmed off the top with a spoon.

Then, same diner, ordered Green Curry Beef. He got served some chicken dish. This time, the server was adamant that he ordered chicken. Even though he had made this big production of choosing a dish when he had ordered. Specifically saying things like I want a beef dish, how spicy is x beef dish, etc. Again his food was replaced. Server tried to excuse her mistakes by saying she was new. Which is totally okay, but really, if you're not paying attention, don't accuse the customer of trying to cheat you.

Lastly, I personally ordered the Thai Spicy Noodle dish. The first bite was sooooooo extremely hot that I burnt my esophagus swallowing it. (I went to the doctor, I'm not exaggerating). I was extremely hungry. But I waited, pushing my noodles around so that the heat could evaporate. 30 mins later, when everyone (including the guy who had to wait for the proper dish to be made) finished their meals, my dish was STILL steaming hot. I don't know what kind of sorcery was used on those noodles, but they were completely inedible during dinner (when I would like to eat them) and instead caused me injury.

So yes, this might be a one off situation. But paired with my previous mediocre experience, this will lead to me to never coming back."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant located on Church Street. Usually busy on weekends, this restaurant offers great Thai fare in a casual, comfortable setting. Outdoor seating is great, especially summer months when Church Street is bustling with residents and tourists."}
{"text":"Located on Church St this place gets more customers. I find their food to be pretty bland. The price is not bad. However based on the quality of the food I won't recommend it to anyone who wants a good meal. The cleanness of the restaurant is questionable as well."}
{"text":"I've been here MANY times over the last 10 years and last Saturday we came in to JUST THAI for a nice dinner in the neighbourhood  - we ordered Mango Salad, Spring Rolls, Green Curry Chicken, Sticky rice with peanut sauce and Cashew Chicken. As well as two ice cold beers. Our server was just great very attentive, the restaurant wasn't very busy, there was a couple of other tables with customers. After a few minutes our mango salad and spring rolls arrived and they we're just yummy! Then our entry's arrive and were very good. I had the cashew chicken and it was actually exceptionally good. My friend had the Green Curry Chicken and she said it was good, even though she didn't eat it all (to be honest she was a little jet lagged). 

For in restaurant service I give JUST THAI - 5 stars....but ordered mango salad and cashew chicken yesterday for delivery and having to wait over two hours it arrived ice cold (even though the restaurant it 6 blocks from my place)....yes I should of walked and picked it up in retrospect.....don't order delivery as it's delivered by JUST EATS and their customer service sucks !!!  And for that I actually only give 3 STARS 

Note to JUST THAI owner - consider having your own delivery driver or stop delivery because the service you use is terrible and my fear is you will start to loose customers!"}
{"text":"-Sub par pad thai
-hot and sour soup was ok
-friendly staff
Recommdation keep walking"}
{"text":"Average at best.

You'd think that a restaurant called Just Thai would pride itself on attempting to maintain the integrity of classic Thai cuisine. I was wrong.

The restaurant itself is modern and pleasant, the staff friendly. The food, pretty bad. Pad Thai is something you don't mess with. It seems that every item on the menu has been modified because they were low on ingredients and thought the customers wouldn't notice. 

This place is only passable if you're drunk and need sustenance."}
{"text":"Really bad. The pad thai was flavourless, with a few small pieces of chicken. The green curry was just bad, no flavour and frozen vegetables. Will not order from here again."}
{"text":"Just thai is literally just thai. Nothing special, I've liked food court thai food better.

I ordered a chicken curry pad thai and my sister ordered a chicken pad thai.
It was quite oversauced to the point where my sister stopped eating after 5 bites or so as it tasted like ketchup.

My curry pad thai was better than the regular pad thai as it didn't taste like a mouthful of tomato sauce, but I couldn't finish it either.

Portions are huge, but we won't be coming back. We ended up taking the leftovers home to add more noodles in both pad thais."}
{"text":"Below average Pad Thai.  Disappointing.  service was attentive.  Too bad, be nice to have good Thai in the area, will look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food. Watched our waiter eat while we ate. He was more concerned with filling his belly than us :)  The Hot & Spicy Coconut soup was to die for."}
{"text":"Came here with 3 coworkers and my loved one. Service at the beginning was good. Waiter came and seated us quickly, offering the menus and asking if we would like to start with some drinks before we order. We ordered food about 10-15 minutes later, first complaint is that the place wasn't very full, it was our group and it took the bartender so long to make 4 drinks, I noticed he had to refer back to the drink menu to check what went into the drink...uh hello? Did you not memorize this small menu during training?! Jesus. Anyways, I ordered the shrimp fried rice...then dinner went sour...waiter brought out the rice, I was just about to dig in when he approached me and said \"Oh, they forgot the shrimp in your rice.\" I was being cool about it but holy shit! What part of SHRIMP fried rice did he not undertstand? Oh well. It was brought back to the kitchen to get fixed. Throughout the dinner, he made no attempts to even come check up on us...umm, rude much? Instead he stood around at the bar, chatting with his other coworkers. Maybe 30-40 minutes later, as all of us were wrapping up dinner, one of my coworkers discovers a random hair in her rice or curry (we have no idea where it came from). Obviously, we complained to the waiter to which he replied \"Would you like another bowl of rice or curry?\" FUCK NO. She asked for a discount off her dinner instead. After he cleared our dishes and left us to chat for a bit, it took way too long for him to notice us flagging him down to get our bills. UGH. 

For all that, this will be the first and last time we ever come here. 
Food got fucked up, waiters and waitresses unattentive...how does this place stay open?"}
{"text":"This place was bad... I ordered the pad Thai and it tasted burnt from being cooked in a burnt pan. My friend ordered the basil beef and it was overly salty. We ordered ice water and only got regular water. Lastly, the waitress was overly attentive - I know this sounds crazy of me but she just gave me my food and within 2 mins she checks to see if everything is ok. I didn't even get a chance to eat it yet! A for effort though but the constant interruption was annoying when I was trying to have a convo with my friend.

Would not recommend - mostly due to food not so much service, that's just me nit picking"}
{"text":"Popped in on a Thursday for lunch. The place was fairly quiet, but it was a late lunch (about 2:30pm)

After reviewing the menu, we both opted for the Spicy Basil Chicken, which came with Jasmine Rice and a Spring Roll. My dining companion opted (for a nominal $1 charge) coconut rice as opposed to the Jasmine Rice. I ordered a diet coke, he ordered a jasmine tea.

Jasmine Tea - rather than tea leaves steeping in a small pot of water, it was a tea bag floating in a coffee mug. Strike 1
Spicy Basil Chicken - although the meat was dry, the vegetables were cooked perfectly and the sauce was flavourful. Weird thing though...I don't eat onions and my dining companion loves them. He had 0 onions in his, mine was loaded with them. 0 on the \"spicy\" scale...if this is spicy then McDonalds ought to warn their customers that Big Macs are spicy. 
Coconut Rice - far too sweet....he had a mouthful and didn't eat any rice after that. 
Jasmine Rice - sticky and cooked perfectly. 
Spring Rolls - they had a curry in the filling...the flavour did not go with the sweet dipping sauce they provided. Strike 2 

Service was fantastic. Our female server was welcoming and very polite. Restaurant was spotless although decor is a little dated.

So...would I go back....maybe...to try something new. I wouldn't drive out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Just Thai was just awful!

Ordered a dirty martini received a martini garnished with line... No olives.

Calamari was our app - it was average.

The pad Thai was unrecognizable. No sprouts, scallions, nuts... Bland, stuck together mess. 

My friend had a curry dish that he left on the table."}
{"text":"Great!  nice atmosphere and a great front window view of Church street - a nice menu convering the main Thai dishes - all of our orders arrived fast, hot and really tasty.  We had a really cheerful and fun server to boot - excellent."}
{"text":"So this place had the standard things that bring me into a Thai restaurant: dim lighting, white modern-looking furniture, ultra-lounge type music, and what I consider \"authentic thai cuisine,\" which I'm sure is not in the least bit authentic (or maybe it is, I don't know!), but I like it. 

So, one issue I had, and this might just be my own ignorance on origin of food, but for a place called \"Just Thai\", I thought it was odd that they would have Hot and Sour soup. I usually only see that on Chinese menus. Very strange. Also, the food was just \"so so\". Now, my friends enjoyed their \"just thai\" spicy noodle and their thai beef. I thought my curry was \"meh\". I could eat it, but I've had better. Also, I don't think what they gave us is \"jasmine\" rice (but maybe I'm wrong). The food also took awhile to reach our table. 

Again, I don't claim to know much about thai food, but I've been to many a thai restaurant (authentic or not). But I know what I usually get at those places, and although they had most of the same stuff, the rest of it was just a little off. 

Wait staff was very friendly though."}
{"text":"The decor on the inside looks really nice, but beautiful warm weather makes the little patio of Just Thai another great place to people watch. The service was sincere and the use of fancy dishes made for great presentation.

The spicy shrimp salad ($8.99) was delightfully colourful, with thick strips of red and green peppers, cucumbers, and red onions covered in a satisfyingly sweet and spicy red chili sauce. The glass noodles ($11.99) were a little bit too greasy, but also very well balanced with fresh vibrant vegetables, large juicy shrimp, and lots of strips of crunchy black fungus."}
{"text":"This place is just around the corner from us and we've been planning on trying it out. One night when we were both starved but didn't feel like going out (too hot), we placed a delivery order through the just-eat.ca website (which they encourage with large signs their storefront) for two simple Pad Thai dishes. 

We waited over an hour and called Just Thai directly to see if they had the order and what the hold up was. They insisted the order had been sent out for delivery and should be there any second. 20 minutes later there was still no sign of the food (we are maybe a 4 minute walk away, literally just around the corner). We called again the person that we spoke to said she had just started her shift and had no information on our order at all so she couldn't help. WTF? You work there, don't you?

We contactedJust-Eat and the rep couldn't get through to Just Thai to find out what was going on as no one was picking up the phone. (Again WTF?) We called Just Thai back and canceled the order (it was now over an hour and a half after we placed it). They were very apathetic and didn't seem concerned or offer any sort of customer service to make up for it. You just lost a customer from your neighborhood. 

Although the customer service rep for Just-Eat.ca was polite and did try to to resolve the issue, in the end they could not provide us with an answer or any resolution or provide any follow up later on. I am wary of using this service again as a result.

We made it clear to Just Thai that we wouldn't be patronizing their establishment via take out, delivery or in person and we'd make sure our friends and neighbors thought twice about it too based on their terrible service."}
{"text":"OK Thai Restaurant, Average Dishes, but not outstanding. Was Disappointed that they did not have Thai Tea."}
{"text":"The food here was great. I popped in for an early dinner and the place was fairly empty. I ordered the Thai Basil Chicken with rice. The sauce was just right, not too heavy or spicy and the portion was large. I love Thai food and this place is one of the best I have had.

I will say the service was a bit slow because they were busy with takeout orders. I would go back."}
{"text":"I was attracted to this restaurant because of the location - great area (Church Street).

Menu was interesting - a step up from your typical thai restaurant.  I wanted panang curry and deep fried tofu (my two staples) but they had neither.

Instead, I had Avocado Spring Roll appetizer which was different but tasty.  For entree, I had gold curry chicken which was spicy - my favorite! 

Nice staff and great ambiance.

Bottom line - I'll try it again when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"Woof, woof.  Maybe I ordered the one and only thing that I should have never had here, but it was memorably gross.

I had a hankering for Pad Thai.  So sorry that my stop for it had to be here.  What is with this dual version of Pad Thai, where one version is made \"authentically\", aka Thai style, with tamarind sauce, and the other one has a tomato or ketchup (shudder!)-base.

I won't go on and on, since I would just continue to share sad details about this one dish.  I had to return it and request for them to make it less saucy.  It just had a fakeness about it.  I obviously got the tomato-y version.  Seemed like a joke that this place, without Thai music in the background or anyone Thai in sight, would be called \"Just Thai\".  

I'd suggest either \"Pi Tom\" (nearby!) or \"Real Thailand\" (on Bloor X Bathurst).  Even Thai Country Kitchen (Kensington Mkt) offers better tasting Thai food.

Would I ever dine here again?  Perhaps if there were a hypnotist handy, s/he could remove my memory of the Pad Thai, and at that point, I'd consider giving this place another try.  In the interim, I truly wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  At all.

~~~
I went with my partner, and just asked what he ate that day.  He said he couldn't remember his dish, only my \"bad Pad Thai\"."}
