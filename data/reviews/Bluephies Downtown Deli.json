{"text":"I have no clue how this place only has 3 stars. I come here at least 2 times a week for their $5 salads... and they're not just lettuce, tomato, and a sprinkle of cheese. They're loaded with toppings, that usually include a meat. Their sandwiches are also a good size, all for under $9 and they include a side like pasta salad or potato salad (not the usual bag of Lays).  OH, and the staff are phenomenal. They have a punch card where if you buy ten meals your eleventh is free for up to $12, and they won't let you leave until you've spent all twelve of those dollars. Even if you don't want anything else right then, \"well, take a cookie home for later\".   My only problem is that they're not open on Saturday or Sunday, and they don't do dinner. Sometimes I have a Friday night hankerin' for a BBQ ranch chicken salad, and I have to wait until Monday."}
{"text":"I work in this building, so it makes sense that I end up here a lot.    They do a light breakfast---  coffee, tea, breakfast sandwiches, fruit cups, croissants, and bagels.  (gotham bagels!)   I love coming here for a quick bite to eat in the mid morning.     Lunch can be hit or miss, especially with their specials.  They serve a lot of sandwiches, soups, and simple pasta dishes.  Most entrees are between $7-8.   This place loves bacon.  Loves it.  If there's a sliver of an opportunity that they can add bacon to something, you'll get it.  And a lot of it.  Their salads are an amazing value.  They're large and well crafted.  I always get the small size and it's plenty.... you'd have to be really hungry to finish the large.  I keep coming back for the staff.  They're friendly and always having a good time."}
{"text":"I'll go back and try the salads, but I went there specifically for soup because I was feeling a little under the weather...huge mistake. Their \"leek\" soup tasted like hot baby food (strained peas comes to mind). I expected leeks and potatoes and carrots in a nice broth, but it was leeks and peas all mashed up in this stringy mess. The flavor wasn't that bad, just boring. It was the stringy texture that really got to me. Two bites and threw it out."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for lunch; great food and awesome service. Love the regular menu, but colleague like testing out the daily specials. The butternut squash soup is mmmm."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Definitely recommend the bacon wrapped cheese curds, Nutella French toast and their bloody menu. Very friendly service as well."}
{"text":"The very wet turkey I had went well with the unpleasant caramelized onions and soggy peppers."}
