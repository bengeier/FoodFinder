{"text":"Great mexican joint. Been here a couples times and they always deliver the goods.  Portions are huge , salsa bar has plenty of choice, food is tasty and fresh. Probably not what you would call an \"authentic\" Mexican restaurant (more of a TexMex feel) but I totally can live with that. One huge platter, a soft drink (or a beer) and a churro (microwaved, NOT GOOD) set me under 20$. Will have to taste the marguaritas next time."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty food, well prepared, and fast. Self-service, cheap fare, and an extra nice aspect: this place has been consistently good like forever (maybe 30 years now? I am not sure exactly, but a very long time, and well kept after all these years)"}
{"text":"I've often said that if I was forced to eat food only from one part of the world for the rest of my life, there wouldn't be any hesitation: Mexican is how I'd roll. My favorite food, Beer and Shot are all Mexican, so whatever genie or cult leader was inexplicably forcing me into this strange dietary restriction wouldn't hear any complaining from this guy. So when a group of us were in search of food walking through downtown Montreal, and nobody expressed a clear preference, my mind went into Robocop vision, silently but vigilantly scanning every storefront for signs of tasty Mexican eateries.  Soon we came across the colorfully painted \"Taqueria Mex\". The food was Mexican, the menu was Bilingual and the logo sported some colorful birdies. I was off to the races, pleading a case for this as our lunch spot.  One odd thing was, there were tables and we were given menus, but no waiters or waitresses. We think this fact may have been explained to us, but as none of us in the group speak french, there were several minutes of waiting for a waitress that never came, before approaching the counter to order and take our food back to our table.  At that point, I was pretty hungry, so I actually opted for 2 entrees, each coming with a side that I shared with the rest of my table, as to not be a complete fatass. I went with the Chicken Burrito Grande, and a steak taco (nachos and rice for the sides). The Chicken Burrito Grande was tasty, but the way it was assembled lended to more of a knife-and-fork style than a standard eat-with-your-hands style I'm accustomed to.   The Steak Taco wasn't as good. As someone who grew up loving Taco Bell's 99 cent tacos, at a hefty $4+ dollars for a single Taqueria Mex Taco, that taco better come correct. I should savor every bite, I should be taken aback by the magnificent flavors, that taco should be giving my taste buds handjobs for over $4 per. Sadly, it was just another blandish Taco, topped with Tomato (ack!) and Avocado. One thing it had going for it though, was an interesting innovation in cheese technology. Instead of sprinkling shredded cheese atop the taco as a topping, the cheese was introduced by being melted between 2 tortillas like a small grilled cheese sandwich. Pretty sweet, actually. However it wasn't enough to save me from feeling ripped off.  Topped off with a couple of Coronas and a trip to their Salsa Bar (featuring 5 different salsas, as well as other toppings and spices) made it quite a nice meal, albeit a little pricey."}
{"text":"i have been eating there almost every day at lunch for the past year. Cheap delicious mexican food. Dont be discouraged by the line up at lunch hour, you rarely wait more than 10 minutes to get your food.  Weird fact: They train a new waitress almost every day. Not sure what that's all about!"}
{"text":"All we had where the enchiladas and the daiquiri.  We were on a food trip.  Can't wait to go back.  The salsa bar was perfect and the location was great.  It was also quick service for a Friday 7:00 pm"}
{"text":"Hmm, over priced for the quantity and yes the quality has gone down since. And what is up with those medicine cup-size sauce containers and the angled glass blocking your reach?! Having to do a kung-fu praying mantis maneuver just to get some friggin salsa is ridiculous. Make up for it by taking your entire plate to the sauce-bar and pour on as much as you like then get drunk next door at Bobard's."}
{"text":"Bland is the word for this place.  From the filling in my rubbery shrimp burrito to the salsa bar - well, okay the verde was mediocre.  I have had suburban prairie 'Mexican' food that had more authentic flavours.  Staff are nice and the prices are average, but the food is well below par.  Montreal is in dire need of a real taqueria."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! So delicious! Walking down Saint-Laurent, we stumbled upon this Mexican jem. Portions are massive and I like that you're able to pick up salsa at the bar. The main course was so good but carb-rific (lol). The quality is great and the service friendly. The churro was alright, not the greatest.   I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Nous arrêtons souvent dans ce petit resto mexicain sur St-Laurent. Le service entre fast food et full service est un peu déstabilisant mais on s'habitue. Je viens pour la bouffe qui ressemble à un mix entre nourriture mexicaine authentique et le tex-mex américain. Je commande habituellement un burrito et ma conjointe les quesadillas. Les deux sont délicieux et frais. Le bar à sauce est intéressant et apporte un peu d'originalité à ce menu qui m'apparaît comme un peu trop convenu. Le décor sympatique et familial, les prix doux et la bonne bouffe nous incitent à revenir. Le service aux tables serait apprécié."}
{"text":"After a long walk around Parc Mont-Royal, we came upon this hidden gem. Nothing fancy, just some good home-style Mexican recipes. The price is just awesome, especially when compared to other restaurants around that area. Edit: This was a review I meant to post from mid-July 2013. It's just that I couldn't find this restaurant on the mobile (iPhone) Yelp app."}
{"text":"This is a nice family restaurant on St. Laurent. The colorful decor may be a little off putting but do walk in, the food is good. I went there two vegetarians who were impressed with the variety of veggie options on the menu. I had the grand beef burrito and was very satisfied. I find their 'half service' attitude strange: you come in, get a menu, sit yourself down, choose a dish, walk back to the cashier to order and pay, sit back down, get served water and whatever you ordered, but need to get up again to get your own utensils and salsa.  Still, the atmosphere is good and it's nice and quite. I was bothered by the flies than engulfed me (and the one that drowned in my beer). Also, as we were leaving, there were some off putting smells (toilet/cleaning products?). This hasn't happened when I was there in the past, and I hope they abolish that fast!"}
{"text":"First time I went there was amazing. Then, terrible, then terrible, terrible, then amazing once in awhile.  But I find myself craving it when I pass by it for some reasons...so I go back. It is really affordable and I do prefer their tacos to 3 amigos, but I'm not a big Mexican food eater so I can only go by my own preferences."}
{"text":"Excellent resto mexicain Bonne portion Drinks savoureux et généreux Bonne ambiance, on se sent en vacance! Très bon service, rapide mais sans pression Bel endroit pour se sentir ailleurs dans la ville"}
{"text":"J'adore ce resto mexicain style cafeteria. J'y vais depuis des annees, je travaillais a cote avant! C'est rapide, frais et mioum dans la bouche. On commande au comptoir, on se prend des ustensiles, sauces et salsas au comptoir et on attend la bouffe assis dans un decor mexicain. Les nachos sont trop cochons, mais a partager car ca fait beaucoup. Je prends toujours la meme chose, une quesadilla au fromage et avocat, un tacos mou au steak fromage, une grosse salade. Si vous avez tres faim vous pouvez ajouter des chips ou du riz pour un petit extra. Pour dessert un churroz au caramel, pas les meilleurs de la ville. Plusieurs breuvages typiques mexicain et de l'alcool, oui oui des margaritas et bieres. J'ai pas gouté aux margaritas, mais ils ont l'air bons! A ce que je sache ils prennent seulement cash...mais y a une caisse Desjardins a cote."}
{"text":"C'est un restaurant tres tres bon dans ma vie j'ai été a plusieur restaurant mexicain et aucun ne fait d'aussi bon nachos, tacos et quessadillas comme celui ci je le recommande fortement a tout les amateur de bonne nourriture mexicainne vs ne le regretterez pas je vous en donne ma parole"}
{"text":"This place is a mix of a restaurant and a cafeteria. You order at the cash and pay immediately. Then the cashier or another waitress brings you your food within 5 minutes.I've been going there for forever. Now I eat veggie and they have a veggie burrito that rocks. Very filling and very tasty- and I usually get it with salad, not rice. I used to come here even when I ate meat and still come here with meat eaters. Everyone is always happy.  You have to fetch the cutlery and condiments yourself and there's an awkwardly placed sneeze protector that makes the task harder than it needs to be but I guess that's minor.  The place is brightly decorated in vibrant colours and it gets 4 stars instead of 5 just because of the weird cafeteria environment. Tasty food though - fairly inexpensive."}
{"text":"My wife had already found this restaurant online when we had a craving for mexican cuisine one day, but it was a bit far from where we lived, it had good reviews compared to those near our home. Then a few days ago,  I had to pick up something I ordered online from a store in St Laurent Blvd, and since it was around dinnertime I asked my wife where she wanted to eat and she pointed across the street at La Taqueria Mexicaine.   It was a cross between a fastfood joint and a sit down restaurant, you order at the counter but the food is brought to your table.  We ordered Chicken Nachos,  a plate of Burrito Grande (beef), a mojito and pina colada and a churro for dessert.  Service was excellent, cleanest smelling bathroom in a restaurant I've ever seen, decor and ambiance makes you feel like you took a trip to Mexico.  My daughter loved the Nachos, and the burrito was great. (We were so hungry we forgot to take pictures of it, lol) the drinks were also very good and had some kick to it. And the kids fought over the churro. Overall a great meal and will be coming back to try the other meals on the menu."}
{"text":"Starving? Fresh, tasty, healthy & FAST service. Order at the counter then your food is served to you.  Mexican wholesomeness at affordable prices."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place ever since I was a kid and, though I must admit, the portions and the quality has gone down slightly in the last year or two there are certain staples that still make it a four star place.  Firstly, their guacamole is the best I have ever tasted (appart from my own of course) and their grilled chicken is always delicious. Pair those with a salsa verde made in house and some warm nachos and you are set. It may be more tex than mex at times, but there is no denying that it is delicious.  I recommend:  Pollo Assado Quesadillas con pollo Guacamole with chips"}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant mexicain aux prix abordables et au service très sympa. Je vous conseille le Ranchero à 14$, c'est le plat le plus cher mais il vaut le coût. Les chips sont chaudes et croustillantes, un bar à sauces à volonté... excellent."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner one night since my friends and I spent quite a lot of time on Saint-Laurent while we were in Montreal, and I have to say I was pretty pleased!  Although the \"Mexican\" seasonings were extremely subdued (read as \"bland\") in everything I tried, everything else was wonderful.    The waitress and cook were funny and nice, the portions were large, and the price was actually right because of just how much food they gave you.  I went with the Chicken Fiesta Salad, and when it came out it was towering with lettuce, avocado, crunchy tortilla chips, lime, peppers, onions, and a piece of chicken that was cooked masterfully.  It still retained all of its moisture and was so succulent with each bite I took out of it.  On top of that, they have an awesome topping bar in the back with a variety of salsas and pico de gallo like any fast food Mexican joint, but what made it special is that they also had a bunch of other toppings to add to your dishes too like fresh cilantro, pickled jalapeños, and more!  Definitely not the fanciest or most haute cuisine food around, but awesome for a late night dinner out!"}
{"text":"When I walked in, it wasn't too busy, though it got a bit busier afterwards. While there weren't too many people working (one server/cashier, and one cook), the service was fast, and very courteous. The server had good recommendations, and overall the tacos were great. I was eating within 10 minutes of walking in there! The selection of food on the menu is astounding, but the quality is absolutely impeccable! I'd suggest anyone looking for decent Mexican food (inexpensive) to try it. They also have a truly awesome salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice ambiance, and very well located. The only reason why this place is not packed is because of a lack of marketing. Stop by before it's waiting room only."}
