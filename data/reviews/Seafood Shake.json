{"text":"A surprisingly good time. Got the seafood lover with medium \"shake\" sauce and then the appetizer sampler. The breading on the app was perfect. 

The amount of food with the main course was a pretty decent amount for two people, barely finished it all. The sauce was divine and the medium heat packed a solid punch, but nothing over the top. 

It's an extremely messy process. No plates or silverware, you just dump your bucket (easiest method) and dive in. They do offer: bibs, gloves, and there are two sinks in the hallway outside of the bathrooms.

I will definitely be going back and recommending this to everyone in the area."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, been there multiple times. The Ma-la sauce is awesome. You can also choose from other flavors. After enjoying the seafood, a cup of fried ice cream is just wonderful."}
{"text":"This is an interesting new space so take most reviews about service with a grain of salt (as usual) 

Bar service is typical and not worth anyones time investing in a review as are much of the sides and such. They're serviceable but if ones review revolves around them, you went here for the wrong reasons.

The main attraction here is of course the seafood pots which are priced somewhat reasonably for the quantity, though an indicator for appropriate quantity would be nice. I had to ask about serving size and in a restaurant  format unfamiliar to the area, this would be welcome and arguably necessary to people with eyes often bigger than their stomach.

I ordered a pot (its the midwest, honestly nitpicking here is unnecessary, all our seafood will be less good than coastal fare) and the important thing here, and arguably the entire restaurant is the sauce you order. The Ma La + Seafood Shake (shorthand; mouth watering Sichuan peppercorn and cajun spice for the uninitiated) is an absolute dream. A hearty unctuous spice perfectly balanced with nose running heat and an earthy citrus flavor you can only get with this combination of spices. If you are sensitive to spice, the \"medium\" rating might seem like a misnomer, but it is right on the money for spice hounds. I am a fan of this style of food and it is pulled off with aplomb and a level of depth that will have me coming back.

Having dined here on a slow day, I cannot comment on the service, but if you're looking for a big ol' pot of spicy fish and sea bugs, you will be absolutely satisfied."}
{"text":"One of the seafood place that I like?if you like seafood, you should go and try it out... I like their sauces, especially the garlic one. Also don't miss the the salt and pepper lobster. It tastes great! I had the starter sampler, it was good too. And you a change to try out every starters.... I also I like their soup, you can ask to make it spicy.... 

I really like the dinner atmospheres as well. Felling like a vacation... if you are thinking about a one trip to the sea shore /beach , this is definitely a right place to go... 

I highly recommend this restaurant, I love it and will definitely bring some friends and visit many time!"}
{"text":"The concept is pretty cool. No plates, no silverware, just use your hands. Seafood is meant to be messy and yummy so I can appreciate that. However, there are some kinks to be worked out considering the restaurant just opened last week. The wait staff (Tia) was patient and knowledgeable with the menu which is VERY important considering that the menu is somewhat confusing. I think the owners should consider adding descriptions to each menu item. Also, for some reason the kitchen ran out of clean small forks for our use although it wasn't that crowded. We ordered the calamari and shrimp appetizer which was in a weird beer-batter. The calamari was also really tough. The saving grace for the appetizer was the yum yum sauce served with it. We also both ordered the snow crab legs with the medium- spiced shake sauce.  All I have to say it that the medium spice was a lot more spicier than I would have thought. Still tasty, but just very spicy. Overall, our experience was decent. We had a fun time eating our food with the bibs and gloves."}
{"text":"Way overpriced on the food. The beer was reasonable enough... but I ordered Calamari and sweet potato fries, and was looking under the small paper boat for the rest of the food! There was hardly anything for what you pay for it. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. Service was sub-par and the staff didn't even seem to know much about the food. They were probably afraid to tell me that it wasn't even that good. I didn't want a full dinner, but If you want to leave with a full belly, you better bring like $50 per person, because otherwise, you will still be hungry when you leave."}
{"text":"Conflicted about this review... customer service was amazing but the food fell short. When we arrived we were seated but that's about it. No one came to give us water or take our order for around 15 minutes. We were given free drinks for the inconvenience. We ordered head on shrimp in garlic sauce, crawfish in cajun, and snow crab legs and king crab legs in the shake sauce. The shrimp they gave us were head off and in cajun. When we mentioned it, they brought us the correct shrimp, let us keep the other shrimp. The appetizer sampler we ordered was overcooked. The garlic sauce had no garlic flavor and tasted like nothing but heated up oil. The king crab legs were overcooked but the snow crab legs were cooked perfectly. They brought us a new bucket of snow crab legs since we told them not to waste another batch of king crab. The new bucket of snow crab was delicious and the shake sauce was to die for. The crawfish were nasty but understandable since they were not fresh and out of season. 

Overall, amazing customer service but food is so-so unless you get the snow crab legs or shrimp in the shake sauce. Also the Mala sauce is not as hot as they advertised but it is very very tasty. I will be giving them a second chance since we went on opening night and because they were short staffed, others were helping in the back."}
{"text":"The raw oysters were okay. That was probably the low point. I had the seafood boil which is basically an Asian style spicy dish here they put it in a pan with heat underneath and it remains boiling while you eat. I had the crawfish, shrimp and mussels. I added some seaweed and enoki mushrooms. It was excellent. 

I believe this place can do a little better, but I still think it's underrated. If you like seafood, you should try it. The decor is also really nice."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I don't regret my visit but I do feel that there are still some kinks to be worked out. I came in on a double date with my husband, brother-in-law, and sister-in-law. I don't suggest this place as a first date restaurant. It's very messy but fun. It was kinda nice eating as a child with my hands in gloves and a bib covering my front. 

The struggle began with the menu. The colors on the menu are hard to read between the dark colors and the glare on the menu from the over head lights. Our waitress Tia was so knowledge about the menu.  She was able to fill in info where things were not clear to us. For example, trying to figure out why the lobster tail was the same price as the whole lobster threw us. The food is by the lb. Of course it says this at the top in title form but without explanation. 

When we got our food, which took awhile vs. the number of people in the restaurant, they didn't have enough small seafood forks for our table.  Tia told us that they ran out.... Apparently they were in short supply for a restaurant that wasn't full. That's unfortunate.

The food was good. I got the Shake sauce on my lobster tail and a mix of the lemon pepper and garlic on my snow crab legs.  Whatever you do, if you do not like spicy food, make sure that you get your spice mild. Medium was a bit much for a few at our table.  The Shake sauce is a blend of the Cajun, Lemon pepper, and garlic.  The lemon pepper and garlic mixture was ok. Very garlicky though.  I wouldn't say it was bad. Definitely interesting. 

I appreciated the amount of food I got for the price and the service that we received from Tia. I'm not sure if I would become a regular but maybe once or so a year wouldn't be bad. I sincerely hope that they make it being the new kid on the block."}
{"text":"I only had 30 minutes to run in here, order, and eat before I had to dash over to an event down the street. First impression is that it is clean, has nautical themed decor (lobsters in nets), and quiet with only a couple people including myself at 6pm on a Friday. I sat at the bar and a young lady named Andrea served me, she was friendly and helpful. I decided to go with the clam chowder and the fried shrimp. 

The clam chowder was nothing special but I added in some of their house sauce that they toss the seafood boils in and it really make the chowder so much better with a nice little kick to it. The Shrimp are jumbo sized and you get about nine of them. I added the cajun? spice to the breading. Just a warning that the shrimp are not deveined if you care about that. 

So while I am sitting at the bar by myself this guy comes in and legit starts casually flirting with the bartender. So awkward to watch, I felt like I was ruining things by sitting there trying to eat my chowder (with a huge black spoon by the way, seriously, who has a mouth that big?). \"Hey, you remember me?... I left that job at Mongolian BBQ ... oh you do makeup? I'm starting to get into photography, you should give me your number.... *burp* oh excuse me so sorry about that\". And she just played right along with it all cool while handing him a beer (no food, he just came to drink and chat). 

So overall, this place is okay. Nothing bad, but nothing really tasty. I would still like to come back and try one of their seafood boils though."}
{"text":"Very friendly server but, over priced seafood. Ordered my seafood with mild garlic and the garlic was way to heavy. It over powered the seafood. Also, the clams, shrimp and lobster was not clean. Clams were gritty, shrimp had vine and lobster had pockets of waste. This was a very cool place, with a neat concept of presenting the food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice both for couples and big groups. Kids would enjoy the tanks with lobsters and crabs. The appetizers were delish! The seafood was good, but if you want great, there is a less attractive place on Lee and Cedar, their sauce is super delish!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times since they unofficially opened to their official opening, and each time I dined at this beautiful establishment the food (namely their signature shake sauce) has gone up multiple levels. They are continually innovating their shake sauce so that you are left satisfied and craving for more. They have tanks filled with live(!) shellfish so you are sure that the seafood you receive is fresh. I absolutely loved the mussels and Dungeness crab (fried shake style). The mussels were plump, juicy, and not too salty. The Dungeness crab was fantastic, the batter was flavorful and the meat was tender. Oh! The clam chowder is a must, there is a generous amount of sliced clam in the chowder, and it is rich and creamy. The service is on point, our waitress, Ivy, was very attentive and kept my cup full and offered great recommendations, such as the clam chowder and Dungeness crab. Also, if you have room for dessert I recommend the ice cream shop next door. It is a unique Thai style ice cream that is made right in front of you t your specifications. Enjoy your meal, I surely did."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Service was good and the prices were reasonable. It was also wheelchair accessible however the men's bathrooms was a little difficult to maneuver in but we find that in a lot of the older buildings."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to a few restaurants like Seafood Shake. We loved our experience here. The food was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place has an awesome setup and it looks great but im not sure if it'll last. Why? We had a big party and we were the only ones in there even when we left. I hope they do make it though but they are also pretty pricey. What's cool is that they are connected to the rolled icecream place next door.

I will say now, WE HAD HORRIBLE SERVICE. I think they just hired anyone who applied because you could easily tell by the servers who were serving us. They were the type who didn't like to work and would just like to get paid.

DO NOT get the fried stuff. From what I saw ordered, they were all over battered and over fried. They looked horrible. I ordered 2#'s of crawfish and added a side of sausage. I ended up with 1# and the sausage. Food wise, it's okay. I've had experience elsewhere so these weren't mind blowing. I also ordered half a dozen oysters and they were all SALTY! It's like they dumped salt on them. Even with lemon and cocktail, it was just too salty to eat. There were others had ordered oysters as well and they said theirs weren't salty but the quality sucked. Hardly anything to eat inside.

My fave sushi spot is down the street so I don't know if I'll ever find myself here again. I certainly won't drive here just for it."}
{"text":"Seafood was very fresh. Cajun seasoning was off flavor. Tasted more like a Mexican Mole sauce. Batter on fried items was very flavorful & not too thick. Overall, feel that Boiling Seafood has more flavorful seasoning but would return to this location because it was more comfortable, offered more seating, & has a full bar."}
{"text":"I was very dissatisfied with service the food and staff they where very rude and disrespectful.i would not recommend or go to this place again
.."}
{"text":"Came with a group of 8-10. Kind of what you would expect from this kind of seafood in a bag place. The seafood is cooked with a sauce in the bag, you can choose the specific sauce and spicy level (we got the ma-la and shake sauce, mild and medium) I loved the shake sauce, and the ma-la (Szechuan numbing/spicy flavor) was pretty tasty too. I wish they served rice or bread on the side, it would've went well with the extra sauce. Kind of pricey for the amount of food you get, but probably to be expected for seafood around here. Also got some Cajun fries, not quite as awesome as Five Guy's Cajun Fries, but still great. Overall pretty good experience."}
{"text":"I got the Beginner boil and it had shrimp, crawfish, claims, mussels, potatoes, and corn. That was already too much for one person but I was glad I ordered the fries, because they were also delicious.

The service was solid and they provided everything we needed readily. The decor was nice and they obviously work to keep a clean atmosphere.

They also have TVs everywhere, so there's something for almost everyone. They offer wings for non seafood eaters but don't expect bread or greens. You definitely don't need it tho."}
{"text":"Love their fresh seafood. Super nice customer service. Highly recommended. Need to come back soon."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out since this seafood-in-a-bag concept is becoming popular in the area. I also wanted to see how they redid the old Winking Lizard. It's nautical themed, but not really in your face.  We (party of two) went on a Thursday  night and were seated right away.  There is quite a bit of seating and there were only 2 other occupied tables around 8:30p.
They have a small bar that only offers beers and wine. That was a little disappointing. We ordered the Seafood Lovers combo and it came with calamari.  We got it seasoned with \"Shake sauce\" which is Lemon Pepper, Cajun and Garlic together and we asked for it to be medium spicy.  We could have went extra spicy.  It wasn't enough for somebody who really enjoys spicy foods.  The food came out quickly.  Within 5 minutes or so. The calamari was really good, my SO liked it more than I did.  I didn't care for the long calamari pieces as opposed to the round bits that I'm used to.  The seafood was more than enough to share.  2 large crab legs, a ton of crawfish, mussels, and shrimp.  It also had corn and potatoes.  We really enjoyed getting to the bottom for all the seasoning.  We were also provided with gloves and bibs but had to ask our server for forks and crab crackers.  The process was super messy, but enjoyable. I wish that we had been offered wet naps at the end. I'm not sure if they don't have them or if they need to be requested.  

Overall, it was a cool way to spend an evening.  Getting to eat with your hands without looking like a complete barbarian.  I got to teach my SO how to eat crawdads ahead of our trip to New Orleans too.  As others have mentioned, you can get to the ice cream shop through the restaurant. I had intended to check it out but there were a ton of people in there and I was impatient lol. Another time."}
{"text":"Pretty good! The experience over all is pretty good and fun. Deff a messy meal. Service was so-so...I will say there were 10 of us so it was a little crazy. This isn't your traditional seafood place- everything is pretty much garlic and Cajun- very southern style. Prices are so-so too. They vary depending on the season. Wouldn't say it's cheap nor super expensive. They say the seafood is fresh and im not doubting it but hard to tell with all the seasoning. I would come again sometime."}
