{"text":"I read so many 5 star reviews and many of our friends recommended Europea, so we had great expectations. The decor is very beautiful and our service was excellent.   We started with the champagne duo which was a 2006 Dom and a Krug for $90. The Dom was great but similar to many other champagnes like Louis Roderer, Perrier jouet, etc. the Krug was outstanding! We loved it and it was the first Krug we've ever had.   We both opted for the larger tasting menu. We also did one premium wine pairing and one divine. The amuse bouches were good but not great. Out of all the items we had, the only things that really stood out were the fois grais and the Krug. Everything else was just ok.   Another gripe was toward the end they decided to 'downgrade' my champagne from Krug to Laurient Perrier and 'upgrade' my boyfriends so that we would have the same champagne. The Krug was exceptionally better so we wish they would have left the original pairing. Also, we asked to revisit the Krug at the end and the waitress had to go check to see. They did it for us, but you would think after spending $1000 for the bill for 2 people that would be no problem!  Maybe it's because we went to Joe Beef the night before and every single dish we had was mind blowing and the wine was fabulous for 1/3 of what we paid here, but we would not return anytime soon. It is a fun dining experience and I would recommend it for a special occasion, but I am more about the quality of the food and wine above all else."}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience. I recommend trying the Signature tasting menu. 5 stars food and 5 stars service. It's pricey, so I would only go for special occasions! You will leave the restaurant full and happy!"}
{"text":"Superb food, presentation, and service. I highly recommend the ten course tasting menu."}
{"text":"Enjoyed their 6 course menu with exceptional wine pairing. Great service, great atmosphere and most of all, great food."}
{"text":"I cannot even begin to describe the food and ambience. This restaurant is simply perfection. The 6 course meal is so well thought out and put together, it truly is a dining experience. If you're looking to splurge on a bit for dinner, this would definitely be the place to go. The food doesn't simply taste wonderful, but they came in such creative ways. Beef jerky hanging on a clothes line? Cotton candy and other small sweets hanging off a tree? Smokey salmon in a book? These are just the some of the small things to expect.   The waiters were so attentive and welcoming. Unlike other fine dining restaurants, I didn't feel judged at all.  Overall, it was a fantastic experience and is a must try."}
{"text":"A friend of ours knew we were going to Montreal and suggested we try this place. Glad that we made reservation even on a Tuesday night. It was a total pleasant surprise. Very hospitable services and delicate dishes.  Unique combination, tastes and presentation. Definitely agree with some of the other comments here that it is a MUST try in Montreal."}
{"text":"This was probably the biggest waste of money.  We got the table d'hote which was 60 bucks per person.  A lot of filler courses for pizzazz that just wasnt impressive, really a lot of fluff.  Started off with the lobster cappucino, which was good once you got passed the cream part.  The appetizer were parmesan crisps with goat cheese.  For appetizers we had the crab declination which was a trio of crab (not good, so bland), got the seared foie gras in which we really enjoyed the morel mushroom emulsion.  The highlight of the meal was definitely our entree.  If we had ordered only the entree we would have rated the meal higher.  We had the filet of halibut, cooked perfectly over creamy mashed potatoes, with a tomato \"ketchup\".  The veal cheeks were great! They were cooked perfectly, and were very flavorful.  Dessert was weird.  It was like a strawberry parfait, different, but not good with madelines.  They also brought out some petit fours consisting of passion fruit marshmellow, pistachio macarons and peach, and chocolate lollipop?  They gave us a nice parting gift of meringue cookies with nuts (although they tasted a little stale)."}
{"text":"I went there with my girlfriend for our 5th anniversary and I must say it was quite an experience. From the moment we sat down we were taken care of, and they keep serving you little portions of different dishes throughout the dining experience. I found that extremely smart, as we never had a moment when we were just waiting for food. You get to try a bunch of different things too so I would definitely recommend this place to foodies.  The food itself was just excellent. Every little portion we got to try was delicious (in particular the lobster cappuccino and the blue cheese lollipops), and our main courses were divine. My girlfriend got the hen, and it was some of the best chicken she's ever had. It is cooked in a clay pot, and a waiter showed up with a hammer and told her she would have to break the clay with it before they would put the dish itself on a plate for her. She thought that was awesome and promptly destroyed it. :)  Dessert was equally impressive, as was the selection of wines.   It is definitely an expensive place, but for a one time experience I think it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"The food presentation was unbelievable and the service was great. They were very attentive and entertaining. This really was the best experience I ever had at a restaurant.   The reason why I only gave this place 4 stars is how I felt rushed while eating and the uninteresting taste to the interesting combinations of ingredients. The flavour wasn't spectacular.   I would probably not come back since I live in Toronto and it's hard to make a reservation for here but I would definitely recommend you try this place at least once!"}
{"text":"Had too much expectations on this restaurant for its price, but is not as good as we thought. This place put a lot of effort on presentation and service, however I value taste more than those. The food is not bad but it's definitely not great - and I believe the chef comes from Asian aspect since we found some similarities among the meal. And Chinese restaurant always serves better Chinese food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not for foodies. It is a twelve year old's idea of fine dining. The Intricate, precious and altogether pointless presentation failed to distract us from the blandness of the food. The hip, well coiffed (seemingly all male) staff were polite, and gamely did their best to soldier through the descriptions of the gimmicks that accompanied the delivery of each subsequent taste-free course. The meal was as proportionately overpriced as it was underwhelming. Do yourself a favor and just go to the pizza place next door for a slice instead, which is what we did afterwards since we barely ate anything there.  We are perplexed by the enthusiasm this place garnered in other reviews - this experience undermined our confidence in Yelp."}
{"text":"I am not easily impressed with restaurants, but out dinner was awesome! We did the 10 course meal. It was the full shebang especially after they gave us a bunch of \"snacks\" and amuse bouches before we even started. The service was spot on, the food was delicious-every course- and they mastered the art of presentation. It was everything you hope for in a meal like that and more."}
{"text":"MY 1st review in 2012 I want to start it with a bang! Kidding.  I beat my RECORD TIME inside a restaurant. 4 HOURS! 8PM-12PM!  My Mom celebrated her birthday here and everyone enjoyed it. If you know me... French cuisine is over-rated :-P Like seriously. But since it's her birthday, I need to be present right?  I'll make this review quick:  We had the $ 95. 50 tasting menu. Consists of 10 courses, and little knick knacks in between. I would say, on my 5th course, I'm already full. Then on my 9th and 10th course, I'm not enjoying it anymore. It's not because it's not good. It's because I'm so full.  My favorite was the Calamari and Bass. I was surprised how good it is. Like literally explosion in my mouth.  Why 5 stars? The service is just impeccable. Our service is very sweet and attentive. Great presentation on each course as well. It was artistically made and they devout some time to make it look pretty - and good I would say. I had some \"wow\" moments. You have to go to check it out. Like really, they will surprise you with something.  Is it worth 95.50 bucks? Yes. Should I go back again? On special occasions only. I recommend it."}
{"text":"It is not often that you get to eat cotton candy and Foie Gras in the same meal. Europea is a very special restaurant, and provides an experience to match.  We were greeted, seated and provided with a load of laundry: two little beef jerkeys hung up on a tiny washing line, accompanied by goats cheese lollipops. This sets the tone for a meal at Europea.  We opted for the tasting menu, but chose to pair it with a glass of our own selection. Their wine list is very expansive, and will accompany any palette.  The tasting menu is a series of delights interspersed with very pleasant surprises.  I'll try not to spoil it for anyone who wants to try the tasting menu, but it was a flawless dining experience."}
{"text":"Fabulous experience. Food was very imaginative. Service was very attentive. Wine list very strong. A true event. Give yourself 3h to be safe. Don't read about the dishes here. Most fun if you are surprised."}
{"text":"Had the tasting menu. The most intricate and entertaining presentation I've seen (5 / 5). The service was very good to excellent (4.5/ 5). Minus half a point for a slight rushed feeling.  The food was prepared exceptionally well (5/5), but I'd say only 2-3 dishes out of 9 or so really wowed me (4.5/ 5). Overall great experience."}
{"text":"amazing execution. Nice and creative recipe. nice atmosphere. Service a bit too relaxed for the place but I guess is the the Quebec way.... Make it a stop when you are in Montreal, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"What an experience we had!! One of the best in Montreal! Just woow!! All the effects! The service! The taste!! All 5 stars! And its totally worth the amount we paid! What a fun way to serve smoked salmon- in a book, which you open and smoke/steam escapes out of it! It was amazing!! Perfect for a date!!! Great job Europea!! If you are looking for somwthing special, try it! You wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"What to say about Europea?  First of all, I'd like to mention that I went with my 12 year old son.  He has a pretty open mind when it comes to food but this exceeded all my expectations.  The servers were great with him, not condescending at all.  He ordered the Cornish Hen and they brought the whole pot out with the hen sitting on a bed of hay to show him beforehand.  He ate literally every bite, including the artichoke puree and the ratatouille and wiped the plate clean.    I had the 6 course tasting menu which was wonderful.  They cook the foie gras on a rock that they bring out prior to the foie gras itself which they sear on one side in the kitchen, and it finishes cooking on the rock right in front of you.  Amazing!  Everything other people have said about the food is true:  The tons of little bites they give you before even bringing your appetizer, the cotton candy, the cookies on the way out.  We even got the note from the chef wishing us a good dinner.  What a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"We were really lucky in having an opportunity to dine at  Europea, because when we called nobody picked up but my  husband left a message. We got a very nice and friendly call back from the restaurant stating that someone has cancelled their  reservation and that we could take their 6pm reservation.  When we first got there the exterior looked very nice  it had 2 levels but we were guided to walk towards the upper level Once we walked it we were greeted by the hostess who offered to check in our coats, and then we were guided to our table upstairs.  Beautiful view we had right beside of the stairs that was next to their wine cellar, and our waiter was kind to explain the menu to us. We are from Toronto and not all of the waiters/waitress took time to explain how their menus work so therefore we were really happy he did.  We both picked different menus, my husband had the signature tasting menu for $109.50 and I had the Table d'hote Discovery for $79.50 the main difference between mines and my husbands choice was obviously  with the signature tasting he had more dishes and for mines i had full size apps and entree.  To start off our experience, it was just as our server said it will be interesting, we had very cute amuse-boche's !!  Just like the photos shown on the site, we had the pesto and cheese lollipops, with popcorn, homemade beef jerky, cheese cigars, and one more item that looked like biscuits with olive oil, and fried chips ! ALL OF THE AMUSE BUSCHE WAS GOOOD !!!! hands down ! it came quick tho hahah a bit to quick because they advise us that due to different items that we are getting etc that timing in between meals would be off which is fine, because me and my husband love to share food. ( forgot to mention they had risotto truffle balls ( OMG GOOD )  Overall the presentation of the food were like art presented, and it was very creative and modern innovated. We liked how we were  very interactive with our food, and how they explained every detail from how it's cooked to the components on our plate.  Dessert was a very cute and romantic feeling for me personally it had cotton candy in the shape of a ball on a display with  tree branches, and they had little candies/sweets in individual packages hung on the tree just like the photos you see. It's such a cute thing we also had a little take away box to put in our sweets if we couldn't finish.  At the end of our wonderful meal we met John ! Wonderful man who explained more about the restaurant and offered to show us the kitchen. You can see the passion he has with his job and the pride of the restaurant. It makes every customer feel like they are just at home even when travelling and that your in good care when your dining with them.  Overall I can go on forever if you can see with this very extensive review I would recommend this restaurant to everyone and all of my friends in Toronto and I look forward to coming back soon !"}
{"text":"Europea is definitely one of my favourite restaurants. Within every course, you receive a surprise and end up being delighted with every bite. Complements to the chef. And make sure to save room for desert."}
{"text":"Well, we just found our new favourite restaurant in Montreal (thanks Pam Kraft for the recommendation). Europea on la Montagne St. We ordered the tasting menu from the front page.  Not inexpensive, but totally worth it  The chef starts us off with yummy cheese lolly pops, a cone of popcorn infused with truffle oil (yum) and one of the coolest presentations I've seen in a long time, a \"clothes line\" of Venison Jerky.  That's all before we even begin our ordered meal Next came a wonderful \"cheese stick\" and those words do not do justice to the food, or the presentation. Let's just say we thought we were being offered a cigar by the looks of it. But when the lid was opened, there lay our yummy treat. A mind blowing presentation of a finger napkin followed. Who knew? Next, a smoked salmon (with real, fresh smoke). It looked like an old antique book, until you lifted the lid, and wonderfully aromatic smoke billowed out.  A lobster cream cappuccino with truffle followed  Next a DimSum dish of raw Tuna with Black Sesami and a Shrimp dish with peanut cream. Oh my.... Next was the calamari with poached quail egg and Squid Ink and Garlic Butter Croutons.  Home made foie gras with shrimp something or other....wow, I'm not a big fan of foie gras, but this was amazing. Oh, did I mention the carrot, green apple and ginger smoothie that came with it? Sea Bass and Beet Root spaghetti follows with a very cool presentation.  Next, a pallet cleanser ofYuzu Freezing Mist. Imagines little bowls of ice cream, served on a platter with a big bowl of dry ice causing fog to just roll off the platter.  Too cool Pan seared Scallop on a hot River Stone (along with a whole bunch of other yummy flavours) Cornish Hen baked in a sealed, breakable clay container.  You are given the hammer to break open the clay pot, before they serve up this scrumptious dish  Next a cheese dish followed by a \"pre-desert\" (I love this concept\" with the final actual desert dish  The food, the presentation, the service, and the wine recommendations by Sommlier Jack Grimaudo all added up to an unforgettable evening.  If you are ever in Montreal, and want to treat yourself, this is defiantly the place.  We will be back.  Thanks Europea for an awesome evening.       ."}
{"text":"The surprises kept coming!  I was excited about this meal but after a few days of seeing the sites around Montreal we considered doing something more casual for the night. After Europea, we were glad that we went with our reservation!    The number of appetizers treat type items that they bring, one after the other, is truly incredible. Truffle oil popcorn, homemade jerky on a clothesline, lobster cappuccino, smoke salmon displayed in a wooden box, on and on. The entrees were very good but the experience was out of this world!  Best surprise came at the end when the cotton candy tree, marshmallows, chocolate truffle, and meringue to-go all arrived.   You pay a lot but you are paying for entertainment as well as your meal. I am cheap/frugal but this was a unique experience worth every Penney."}
{"text":"This restaurant was special. Sooo much food but its presented in such a creative way. Truly shows the chefs artistic imagination with culinary art. Everyone should experience this amazing place. Thank you for everything and hopefully ill be able to come back!!"}
{"text":"The worst restaurant I've ever been in Montreal. Upon arrival, the valet asked me if I'm Uber driver waiting for someone to pick up. Things went wrong from the start.  I had to plead with the server to explain the menu and to order drink. The server took my bottle of champagne away from my reach and I had to signal for each refill - very uncomfortable. This is enough about the service - the worst. The service is bad for a reason. Serving each table is a logistics nightmare since everything they do is unpractical.  The food is bland and nothing exceptional about it. I ordered the complete testing menu ( not short one) to gain full experience. What a waste of money.  The ambiance is stuffy and the two guys sitting next to me were so pretentious. I'm sure they have small dick.  All in all this place is for losers who want to make themselves feel important. But in reality they are nothing.   Being clean - they bring me foods in ancient book cases that cannot be cleaned. I question the practicality of this establishment. However the chef is able to fool enough people to stay in business.   In conclusion - I prefer not to go back again unless for some unforeseen reason. I advise for others to stay away unless to quench curious desire.   I'm done visiting restaurants like this. Toque fooled  me once and now this. I'll never be fooled again.  \"The David Copperfield of Restaurants\"  This is a place to witness the worst of humanity. People taking advantage of the poor and institutional corruption."}
{"text":"Ate at this restaurant for a recruiting dinner and it was EXCEPTIONAL! The service was also awesome and the small dishes in between the courses were very unique and delicious. For example, one of the small dishes came out inside a wooden book. I would highly recommend their menu degustation. Lastly, the desserts that were served were presented really well. The dessert plates came out like a tree with cotton candy as the bushes and cookies and macarons in little bags hung from the branches. Overall, it was awesome. I've never been to a restaurant like this and the setting was really pretty and moderately quiet. It is a really good place to take somebody out for a date!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, valet parking, good start!!! Had the tasting menu with 12 courses. Every dish is prepared with attention, delicate and wonderful presentation. The taste is very good too;) The only reason this restaurant did not get its 5 stars is because on the ambiance, a bit stuffy and boring for me...however perfect for business dinner or a very romantic quiet evening..its worth trying it out!!! The food and service are excellent!"}
{"text":"The food and service was out of this world.  The wine parings were incredibly well-done.  I recommend that the restaurant refuse young children in the dining room.  The ambiance is disturbed by children getting bored and noisy while their parents enjoy a 3 hour meal.  I don't blame the child, I blame the parents and the restaurant for not realizing that that young children will get fussy when kept awake until 11pm, and bother the other diners.  Also, there should be a dress code.  Basketball shorts, a t-shirt and flip-flops, daisy dukes and a tube top, are not appropriate attire to dine - unless you're a rap star and an hourly employee.  I understand they just took over the whole building, so perhaps the restaurant over-expanded."}
{"text":"Table d'hote for about 60$ (4-5 service),  tasting menu for about 90$ (10 service),  You're thinking, wow pretty good deal, probably just run of the mill restaurant? wrong.   This place churns out some really nice dishes, it's imaginative and original. The dishes are quite tasty and refined, nice combination of textures, and ingredients.  The dishes and wine are well paired, food this caliber is served at  restaurants that cost twice as much...the ingredients are fresh and the plating is very appealing. Did i mention it was tasty too? yep very tasty.  I remember very good ravioli with mushrooms, the entrées are very good. The ingredients are very fresh... all around it is exceptional.  But the best is the Dessert, a macaron, ice cream, mousse cake, chocolate sauce, some coffee sprinkles, then as you're eating, they bring out mini madeleines fresh from the oven, then a few minutes later they come out with cotton candy, then a whole slew of mignardise like jellies and little chocolates and what not... i mean dessert was a little canival of sweets that will really appeal to your inner-child... really it made me feel like a kid again... It is the best dessert experience I've ever had!!!  We were in love with this place, and the hostess even gave us a tour of the place, got to see the kitchen and the pastry kitchen, yep two separate kitchens it was a cool place to go, also it's a very noce romantic place, good choice to bring a special someone you want to impress..."}
{"text":"A very special evening.  We were a group for a birthday.  We were pampered like there is no tomorrow!  The service staff gets 6 stars in my book.  Eating a Europea is all about the show and the extras.  Surprises after tasty surprises.  Why not 5 stars you may ask? The food was somewhat bland (I feel like I am committing a huge sin writing that).  I has scallops for my main course and it was... short on flavor?  The desert (besides the extra sweets and cotton candy and, and ,and...) was a spin on eggs and hash brown. No one around the table I think liked it!  At that point we were all full so no one said much.  Weird textures, weird taste, it just did not work.  My wife had the foie gras that was cook on a heated stone with maple flavor or vapors under a glass dome.  Spectacular but the foie gras was essentially raw and aaaaa... well a bit slimy.  We both love foie gras but this was weird.  For the rest, the calamari carbonara was yummy, the lobster cappuccino like nothing you ever had, and on and on.    So I am torn.  I think I will have to go again.  On the other hand, so many other places to try and so little  time."}
{"text":"I came here for valentine's day a couple years back and I still dream of this restaurant.  What struck me most was the very elaborate and refined menu.  We went with a full tasting menu with wine, and we enjoyed the most delightful and eventful meal of our lives to date.  The creativity of the chef and the flavors will have you impressed for years to come (like myself).    Alas, since I am small of stature, I was unable to finish my meal or wine, which paired excellently with all the courses.  I only wish that I had a bigger stomach and higher alcohol tolerance!    What was even nicer about the night was that we parted with some gifts courtesy of the chef that night.  As if the experience wasn't enough!    I would LOVE to come back here, but the dinner service came out to about 500$ with tip for the two of us (pricey, but it was well worth the culinary experience).  I'm guessing that since it was valentine's day and it was a special menu, the prices were higher than usual.  Either way, I liked this place much better than Toque! where I experienced a similar (but sub-par) tasting menu with wine, so if you've got the urge to splurge, I'd highly recommend Europea."}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. I've eaten some pretty long meals, but the degustation was a 3.5 hour experience. The 10 courses is more like 15 after the amuse bouches, etc. We finished a bottle of wine and had 4 courses left.  Service was fantastic. The special touches and creativity are unparalleled.   Word of warning, you should refuse to sit on the second floor. We bounced around (wine glasses shaking, noticeable chair vibration) with every step of every waiter, and they have a lot of waiters. I'm going back if I'm in Montreal again, but I will walk out before I sit on the second floor."}
{"text":"I love Euproea. If you treat dinning as an experience as opposed to just good food, you will love it too. I was surprised and delighted for all the gifts from the chef. It was fun and creative. The food is great too. I don't think it is too expensive given the amount of variety you will receive. Try the tasting menu. It will be a fun night you will remember :-)"}
{"text":"We came here due to the Yelpers so I had high expectations and in most cases, the expectations were met.  We had the 5 course pre fixe menu and the food was very good (foie gras was delicious).  As the other yelpers indicated, there were pre appetizers, pre entrees and pre desserts which is great but I must say I could not eat another bite after the final dessert. I cannot imagine ordering the 10 course pre fixe menu as the law of diminishing returns would kick in after the 5th course.  Although the service is decent,  it was spotty at times due to inconsistent lag time between each meal.  Overall, it was not the best we ever had but it was very good."}
{"text":"What an experience! It's important to note that if you order from the a la carte menu (rather than the tasting menu), you're still getting bite-sized samplers of a lot of dishes along the way. While our main dishes were delicious, because you're getting a lot of samplers both before and after your main course meal, the experience becomes more about these samplers, rather than the main course dish you actually ordered. So if you are agonizing between two main courses -- don't fret and just order whatever \"speaks\" to you the most. In the end, you'll likely be nearly full before the main dish even gets to you, so it doesn't really matter.   We had approximately six pre-main course samplers and each one was delicious and beautifully presented, and after our main course, we had approximately seven different dessert tastings (including cotton candy, macaroons, cookies, and madelines! -- is it obvious how much of a sweet tooth I have?)   Europea is my new favourite restaurant for special occasions. We were a group of six on a budget so we all only ordered main dishes (with tax and tip this came out to about $70 per person). But it was the best $70 meal I've ever had. It was fun to see what sampler was coming out next, and it made for some interesting conversation and was a truly unforgettable experience. Perfect for all occasions -- anniversaries, birthdays, promotions, first dates, wooing business clients, vacations -- atmosphere is elegant and classy but not stuffy. Might not be good for a person on a diet, a person with a lot of allergies, vegans or vegetarians who don't eat fish/seafood. (I mean that sincerely -- you don't get to select your samplers so it's hard to \"track calories\" if that's what you do.)"}
{"text":"When you give them 5 stars it's because they deserve more.. I passed by without a reservation and decided to try my luck. The host was so polite and found me a spot and sat me down for a beyond expectations experience. Ordered an appetizer and a main and got at least 10 amuse bouche in between and then their heartwarming deserts.. A MUST try .."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. Had the tasting menu. Was very impressed with the food the presentation and the service. Really an experience that you must try."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been here twice. Both times, everything was perfect -- food taste, presentation, service, and ambiance. We were completely impressed. One of our favorite dishes here is scallop, which was cooked so delicately. It's so soft we felt like it almost melted in our mouth! We'll definitely come back here next time we're in Montreal."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place only has 8 reviews so far.  Not sure how long it's been in business, but I would have thought more people would have reviewed the place.  It was very easy to setup a reservation as I did it online.  It was a Monday evening and it was not very busy.  A mix of tourists like us and business dinners.  We sat on the second floor.  Noise was not an issue.  I'll admit that I was put off immediately with the service when they took our order.  The server asked me for my order before asking my wife.  So I told him what she wanted to order and then gave my order.  That said, the rest of the waitstaff were much better and service improved over the course of the evening.  To start, I had the crab declination, which was fantastic.  My wife had the seared foie gras, which tasted great, but for the price we paid, we were expecting more foie gras.  Perhaps I'm being hard on them as the Canadian dollar has probably appreciated since they first put this menu together.  The pricing would be at par to what we've paid in the past were the CDN$ be weaker.  I'll pause here and note that the Parmesan and oregano bread rolls were great.  None of the bread was warm when served to us.  But they had good texture, crispiness, and taste.  For entrees, my wife had the lobster stew.  Now, if we hadn't eaten at Bonaparte earlier on our trip, we would have the said the lobster stew was great.  However, the one at Bonaparte was both more in quantity and better prepared.  I had the braised short rib, which was fantastic.  Throughout the dinner, we were served a number of amuse-bouche.  The first two prior to the starters were a crispy sandwich of cheese and tomato on a lollipop stick, and a lobster cappuccino with slices of truffle.  The former was just ok and the latter was very good.  Between the starter and the entree, we were served two more.  The first was an egg nog with shaved truffle served in an eggshell.  The second was a melon sorbet with prosciutto and splash of port.  Both were very good.  In order for me to have rated Europea as 5 stars, their service would have had to have been impeccable from start to finish, there would have had to have been more foie gras in the starter, and the lobster stew would have had to have had more lobster.  That said, it is still a great place and one that we'll likely try again.  Oh, some other thoughts.  The 9-course tasting menu looked very good.  It had a bit of everything that we wanted and it was very tempting.  However, we went for a la carte because we wanted to try the lobster stew.  \"La table d'hote\" menu also looked good, but the entrees were not enticing enough."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I have ever had! You must go here if visiting Montreal. The restaurant is very intimate--try to reserve a table upstairs.  What I loved about Europea was that every course was very creative, playful, sophisticated....  Appetizers: \"lollipop-like\" parmesean crisps with cheese, lobster \"cappacino\"...  entree: mushroom ravioli with truffles...SO GOOD  dessert: This was the best part-bright pink cotton candy presented very creatively, macaroons, little French cookies that came in a Chinese takeout container...  I will honestly go back to Montreal just for this restaurant because I am so interested to see what their next menu will be like."}
{"text":"I heard this was an amazing restaurant, but it was really even better than expected. Each dish was incredible and in between the restaurant serves up creative little bites.  We had the waiter pair our dishes with a recommended wine and the wine choices were perfect also. Service & atmosphere... all A+. So far, this is the best restaurant I have been to in Montreal."}
{"text":"If you want to have a different culinary experience just go there and they will amaze you with their original dishes and presentation and flavors , it is a mixture of art and flavor and presentation in each dish done by the most sophisticated chef in Montreal , he takes care to make each client a VIP In his restaurant while his very caring staff  don't leave you a second without assistance , deserves to be number one in Montreal ! Bravo"}
{"text":"Europea might just be the best meal I've ever had. I had the tasting menu, which is about $100. A little pricey but definitely worth it.  The tasting menu is a culinary experience to say the least. The presentation of each item is very interesting and creative. Everything was amazing. I particularly loved the lobster cappuccino which was out of this world.  This place is simply world class. Impeccable service as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience- think gourmet French cuisine meets Harry Potter! We really enjoyed the chefs 12 tasting course....whole meal was full of elegant surprises. Just go!"}
{"text":"some of the best meals i've ever had were from restaurants/eateries that are outside the good ol' US of A, which makes me kind of sad because chances are, i'll never get to eat at those places again.   but now there's europea restaurant! a mere 5-hour drive from boston, this is much easier to get to than, say, marrakesh, cusco, and kuala lumpur, so i'm very happy!  when my mom and i chose to have dinner at this place, the main reason was simply because we were parked near it. we looked at the menu, and it looked pretty good. we had no idea that we were about to have quite a dining experience!  we walked in around 7pm on a tuesday night without a reservation, and we were seated right away by the friendly, professional staff. we weren't really very hungry, so we just ordered one appetizer (seared foie gras) and one main dish (braised veal cheeks) to share. i also ordered a glass of pinot gris, recommended by the sommelier--so refreshing, light, and good!  what proceeded in the next half an hour or so is that complimentary amuse bouche kept coming and coming and coming and coming. cauliflower, sausage, lobster bisque...i wish i could remember them all! but by the end of it, we had a total of 8 amuse bouche, plus some freshly baked bread. every single bite was heavenly!  when our foie gras finally arrived, we were already kind of full, but we weren't ready to quit yet. the foie gras was rich, delicious, and just melts in your mouth. (my mom said it was her favorite out of everything we had that night.) a few minutes later, our veal came. it was tender, moist, and flavorful.  but wait! there's more!   after we finished our main dish, our server asked us if we wanted any dessert, but we were both so full so we declined. a few minutes later, a complimentary dessert plate arrived. it had french macaron, strawberry marshmallow, and a bite of pistachio cake. plus, there was also a bowl of cotton candy! even though we were already full, we managed to finish our desserts, all of which were as yummy as they looked.  europea, thank you for a DIVINE DINING EXPERIENCE! next time i'm in montreal, i'm definitely going back! (but next time, i'm making reservations--by the time we left the restaurant, it was already packed and people were waiting for tables.)"}
{"text":"Unforgettable experience in Europea, starting from the exceptional welcome to surprising appetite (beef jerky, cheese lollipop...) and to entree. The presentation of the food was phenomenal. The lobster cream cappuccino, the sea bass fillet and the clay pot cornish hen entree were excellent. In fact, I would like to thank their attentive service, especially the restaurant manager's. At the end of the dinner when I expressed that I was hit by my personal migraine, (nothing from the food), they actually helped me to call a taxi. That is a 5-star hospitality. Europea, thank you."}
{"text":"(see explanation of ratings below)  5 of 5 stars (excellent, fine dining).  One of the most memorable meals of our lives.  Huge emphasis on creative showmanship and presentation.  About $90 per person, one cocktail each, no dessert, tax (15%) included, gratuity not included.  Allow 2.5 hours for the smaller of the two price fixe menus.  Simply wonderful event from start to finish.   We had about six amuse bouches including:  -Cheese \"lollipops\" with truffle popcorn -jerky on a clothesline -cheese \"cigars\" -mini corn muffins -book of smoking smoked salmon -assorted mini desserts   Great service and very good sommelier, Jack Grimaudo.  About my ratings:  Only high-priced dining establishments can garner five stars.  Until yelp realizes that a fast food joint cannot possibly be ranked equally with a $100 per person place, I need to draw the line somewhere.  If we were only talking about the quality and presentation of the food, it would be a different story.  But, as we know, yelp's rankings take into account the entire dining experience.  Therefore, I divide restaurants into three categories (and I wish yelp would do the same):  1) fast food and \"fast-casual\", low-priced (no table service).  2) casual, mid-priced dining (table service, average entrée price: $10-$20).  3) fine, high-priced dining (linen napkins, no plastic cups, no TV's in dining room, average entrée priced at more than $20, can vary depending on the city).  High-priced dining can earn a max of five stars.  Mid-priced dining can earn a max of four stars.  Fast food can earn a max of three stars."}
{"text":"5 stars for the experience, 4 stars for the food. Great service, very interactive, and a creative menu. Desserts were fantastic. The meal was also very good (not all were hits but most were quite tasty) and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is worth the price of admission.  Very rich food with whimsical little apps in between made for an enjoyable experience.  Service was great and attentive, while the sommelier was very helpful.  It is located right off Ste. Catherine street and is a must try.  Looking forward to going back again."}
{"text":"Been there once for a wedding banquet It was a real great gastronomic expérience   That's what i call a restaurant, very pro The chef is friendly and High level skilled  If you never tried mollecular food, Its definitly the right place  Its expensive but worth each pennies"}
{"text":"This place has great presentation. They try to make your dining experience a special one! If you haven't gone, try to make it here at least once for a special occasion. Then after your five course meal, save lots of extra room for dessert. The cotton candy tree was exquisite!"}
{"text":"Je suis allée pour ma fête, des années que je voulais y aller. Le service 10/10, la bouffe 10/10 la seule chose... Le menu dégustation et le même qu'il y a 2 ans j'aimerais que le restaurant change le menu de temps en temps mais sinon tien de mal a dire.... Tout un expérience."}
{"text":"LOVED every single surprise from this restaurant. Best dining experience ever! Definitely order the calamari, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Vegans and vegetarians take note! Two full multi course menus available. Creative and beautiful. Everyone was very respectful and careful to serve according to restrictions.   It was my second time going with the vegan dégustation option and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The 9 course tasting menu was heaven. Simply one of the best French fusion restaurants in Montreal.   Seating is limited and reservations are required but you won't be disappointed with the food or service. They have an extensive wine list as well.   This restaurant feels much more intimate than Toque since it's more dimly lit and there are several floors to the restaurant vs. a big open space.   It's definitely worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"If you want an amazing experience, this is the place. Every serving is a full presentation. Absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"I am not in the habit of leaving internet reviews, but I feel that the world needs to be warned about this restaurant: it is a gimmicky, gaudy, over-priced tourist trap.  As a preface, my girlfriend and I didn't actually end up eating very much food there - we actually just chose to leave after our drinks/appetizers and before paying several hundred dollars for what we surmised would be a horrible meal.  So, it is possible that the entrees at Europea are in fact very good, but I doubt it, and even if that is the case, the place is pretty tacky and dingy.  To put the review in context, my girlfriend and I are mid-20s Americans with what I'd call reasonably smart tastes in food and culture - we are not foodies etc., but I'd say we know bad food and a bad restaurant when we see it.  We booked a reservation here after arranging a last minute trip to Montreal and were looking for a traditionally upscale French dinner to cap off our long weekend in the city.  Europea had great reviews on yelp and opentable, the menu looked good, it is run by a celebrity chef, we were staying a few blocks nearby and appeared to be in a location where you'd find good restaurants, so it seemed like an obvious choice.  Our first concerns emerged as we saw the neighborhood, which is the type of downtown area filled with taco bells, souvenir shops, strip clubs and, of course, tourist trap restaurants.  We decided to google image Europea to see what the inside looked like - judging from the photos online, it appeared to be a tacky restaurant, but we placed some trust in the glowing reviews on yelp and decided to show up for the reservation anyways.    We walked in to find the restaurant exactly as portrayed in the images - it looks like it was styled in the early 1990s and hasn't been renovated since.  Picture fake plastic neon colored plants, neon fluorescent lights on the bar, some 90s Euro techno music as light background music, dingy carpets, worn silverware and waiters in ill-fitting tuxedos.  Things didn't look good, but we still gave them the benefit of the doubt, and were seated by the hostess and ordered two martinis.  Our table was next to the staircase in the center of the restaurant and everything on it shook any time someone walked up or down the stairs.   The martinis came as the host brought out some complementary appetizers: a small dried \"meat strip\" hanging on a tiny clothes hanger, garlic-olive bread sticks, some kind of pesto \"lollipop\" and truffle-cheese popcorn (I think?).  Each food item came with a little story about its preparation.  We took a sip of the martinis, which were gin and vodka respectively...they must have been 50% water, and to boot, were served in metal martini glasses with a comically large stick of olives across the top, so large in fact that we couldn't get the olives in the drink.  We then tried some of the small appetizers and it was impressively bad: the meat strip was glorified beef jerky, the lollipop was horribly according to my gf and the popcorn/breadsticks were not only disgusting, but seemed like they had been left out for several days...just musty, stale and soggy all at once.  The waitress then came by and offered us a hot towel, which she prepared by pouring hot water on a compressed roll of cotton with a teapot, which then expended into a soggy, lukewarm paper towel.  Our waitress then came to the table with a wooden box, opened it and offered us two \"cheese cigars\" (a direct quote)...the cheese cigars were, predictably, your standard microwavable fried mozzarella sticks, but I can't even say they tasted as good as something you might buy in a freezer aisle.  That was the end for us - it's not a cheap restaurant, and we weren't going to risk a few hundred dollars on their food.  So, we got up and left, got a take-out margherita pizza from a place up the street, watched a movie in our apartment and made a toast to not wasting our money on bad food.  Long story short, this place is a tourist trap built to take the money of people that don't know any better.  It is well-reviewed, which I can only presume means that many people on Yelp don't have the most sophisticated of tastes.  But, if you are looking for type of experience described in those reviews, I'd suggest looking in a different neighborhood.  We wish we had booked something in Plateau or one of the other more interesting, cultured neighborhoods."}
{"text":"I took my husband to Europea for anniversary. We ordered the course menu. All of the food was excellently presented visually and verbally (in English). The wine was perfectly paired. There were numerous snacks before our dinner even started which was nice, and all of the 10 or 12 coures (i forgot how many there were) were very small so you really could eat them all and not feel overfull. My only complaint and it is a big one is that the food was not excellent. Everyone around us got the same course menu and it just seemed that it was pushing food out and neglecting the taste option. This is not to say that the food was bad, it was not. It just was ok. Also, our bill was over $400, which we expected from previous posters."}
{"text":"Service is impecable! We had the tasting menu and every course was a surprise. The smells, the look, the taste and presentation of each and every plate where a story of its own.  This restaurant will surprise you! Not only because of the flavours but also because you get to interact in the process of the food being brought to you.  Fine dining at its best!!! Highly recommended if you are in Montreal!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation on our first night in Montreal without knowing what to expect. We both chose the chef's degustation menu and were not let down. The courses were creative and fanciful, service was professional and friendly and ambience was pleasant. One of the best chef's tastings I've had. We would definitely return if we make it back to Montreal in the future.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Mu husband and I came to Montreal for a culinary weekend, we did our usual research for the best places to eat in the city and book a table here. We ordered the degustation menu, and let me tell it was really worth it! We loved it, one dish was better than the other, and the dessert, OMG, it was good! I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been to. The food is delicious and the service is amazing. The unique little plates that come with the normal 3 course dishes are a welcome surprise and the cotton candy dessert is so fun and exciting. The caramelized scallops with asparagus risotto is heavenly. The host and staff were courteous and extremely warm and professional. A great recommendation to all living in or traveling to the city."}
{"text":"Wow et wow ! L'Europea offre une expérience culinaire unique et délicieuse. Il y a trois choix de menus : Dégustation (10 services), découverte (Table d'hôte) et à la carte. On peut donc tous y trouver son compte.  J'ai opté pour le menu dégustation qui permet vraiment de vivre l'expérience. Ce fut émerveillement après émerveillement! Tous les plats étaient délicieux. J'ai bien apprécié également l'accord mets/vins et mon cocktail d'hibiscus.  Le service et l'ambiance était très agréable !  Europea est inscrit à la liste des meilleurs restaurants au Canada; en l'essayant on comprend pourquoi !"}
{"text":"Eurpea was recomended from our hotel.  However, If you are hungry do not bother coming to this place.    Starting on a bad note...Our table was updatirs near the spiral staircase and shook everytime the waiters and patrons went up and down the stairs.  That was very distracting.  The portions were small, in fact the chef contantly sends out free apps, like the lobster bisque in a espresso cup  Other free apps were cheese cigars, similar to a mozarella stick, tempura cauliflower, mini olive muffin and a small sampling of  deserts.  However, the real misconception was the hen I ordered was shown in the roating pot tableside  and was brought back to the kitchen and presented back to me with only 2 oz of meat.  For the price of $34, I should get 1/4 bird.  I also agree with other reviews the wine pours are skimpy as well.  The food presenations was pretty cool, but I would rather have bigger portions.     I would not go back again.  Try DNA aor other guide book recomendations,"}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful and classy from the moment that you walk in. They took our coats and seated us promptly. The table on the top floor near the stairs bounced from time to time as people walked heavily. The presentations were beautifully prepared, the wine menu was extensive.   The presentations were fun, but I was more interested in the underlying food. The popcorn was too old and hard, the cigars too salty, the smoke from the salmon box was delightful. The butters were interesting and the bread fresh but overly crusty. The clafoutis was served in an incredible little dish. The foie gras was good but not the best that I have ever had, the caramelization was a bit too deep, the canele didn't have the crisp exterior, though the cloudberry was nice. The veal cheek was incredibly beefy in flavour, the potatoes on top were wonderful. Dessert was beautiful to behold but not as sweet as I would have liked. The champagne macaron didn't really have a great champagne flavour, but the macaron was well made.  Do this for the experience. The delights of having different plates put in front of you with interesting containers. It's a beautiful presentation and the service."}
{"text":"Proper week-end indulgence  After a terribly disappointing Friday dinner, I was left craving a proper week-end indulgence and Restaurant Europea was it.  Entering there were many other patrons who came through the door within seconds of my party but the hostess not only kept a cool demeanor but with the aid of her coworkers gave a warm & sincere welcome to all and quickly seated us.  Jérôme Ferrer, Grand chef also warmly welcomed all the guests.  We were well impressed with the elegant ambiance of the upper floor. This was sign of the good things to come.  We attended the Simon Durivage, Friends Brunch, a novelty as Restaurant Europea does not usually serve Brunch, and it was their first time.  We started with the viennoiserie; small loaf of brioche (while respectable not my favorite, I prefer Pain Dore's), croissants (the best I've ever tasted) and tasty chocolatines, served with brown whipped butter, plain butter and flower butter (appeared to have violet petals through it). The Fresh squeezed orange juice was sweet and pulpy. Creton a tartiner was finer than those served at Cabin a Sucre. Les oeufs a la Mexicaine de Simon Durivage, looked like the a daisy; the yellow fluffy egg in the centre of the flowered shaped bowl.   The service was impeccable, when I asked about the ladies room I was escorted to it and the gentleman opened the door for me.   Mom enjoyed her Braised Veal La joue de veau du Quebec braisee lentement a ma facon aux ecorces d'agrumes. Lamelles de pommes fondantes et topinambours & I my scallops with lobster Petonlces XXL saisis et nappes d'une sauce nantaise cirtonnee. Sa marquise de homard et medaillon confit. Racines de salsifis braises, immensely.  The tableware was unique and elegant, the presentation true art and most important of all the food tasted fantastic. We will return. Yum!  We ended on the sweet note Tartelette gourmande de nos patissiers, creme chantilly et coulis de fruits rouges et Barbe a Papa.  Restaurant Europea does Brunch so well I really hope they'll do it again, even if it's only for the HighLights Festive."}
{"text":"I have traveled all over the world and have gone to restaurants of this category (ie Alinea, Charlie Trotters, Monte, Duomo, etc) and I have to say this place was very good. The service and presentation was excellent. The food inventive and creative at the same time delicious. You pay around $120 pp for the standard prix fix menu and it was enough to get your gastronomy going and your appetite satisfied after a 3 hour dining experience. This is a great value for this luxury dining experience.   If you are a dessert person, you will it more because it was packed. Unfortunately we avoid refined sugar so we did not partake to it. We called and asked if there can be substitutions or refined sugar can be replaced by natural sweeteners so we can try the desserts. They said that the chef will do something. They gave us a bowl of fresh berries. That was not what I was expecting. In other places, they either used the natural sweeteners or gave us other options."}
{"text":"The food is wild and there are many delicious surprises.  Highly imaginative ingredients, techniques and presentation.  For example our prosciutto was served on a clothesline accompanied by goat cheese lollipops.  Tasting menu was $97.50.  I'd give it 6 stars if possible."}
{"text":"great food, amazing presentation, formal but relaxed atmosphere with great staff."}
{"text":"A memorable experience! Definitely reserve a dinner here if you're in Montreal and debating on where to go for a once in a lifetime experience. I had booked an anniversary dinner here with my boyfriend and although I had skimmed some reviews, I didn't have any expectations of the restaurant.   I'll try not to spoil anyone's time here as I believe some of the best parts of the meals are the ones hardly mentioned in the reviews.   Throughout the whole meal, my boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by each dish they brought out to us. There are no complaints, although I highly recommend that you anticipate on spending at least two hours here. Service was impeccable, as each server would elaborate on each item they brought out and any questions we had were answered.  I'll reveal one secret: make sure to save room for the desserts they bring out in the end!   This was one of the best meals of my life and although it requires some saving up for, Europea is worth it (and I don't think my boyfriend will ever be able to outdo this reservation ;) )"}
{"text":"Unbelievable!  Every course was delicious.  I had the short-ribs which were tender as mother's heart. The tasting menu was so satisfying.  Service was consistently excellent.  Great vibe."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why someone classified their menu as Polish / French, but I can assure one and all, that the menu is very, very french.  The only thing I have to say about Europea is there is going out to dinner to eat, and going out to dinner to dine. Going to Europea, is going out to dine and experience food using all 5 of your senses. The food was beautiful to see, sometimes to hear, smell, feel, and taste.  My wife and I had the 99$ taster menu with wine pairing and every glass of wine / champagne complemented the plate in front of us beautifully. We were able to see and feel the passion and knowledge the sommelier had for the wine/champagne he was serving us. The server, explained to us eloquently in French and English the plate in front of us what we were about to have served. All in all, the service from the moment we walked into the restaurant, until we left was impeccable; we were even asked if a cab was needed as we paid the bill and one was waiting for us, as we walked out the door a few minutes later."}
{"text":"Amazing experience!!!! Nothing like this place. So, trendy and classy! The service-impeccable. The decor-1st class, cutting edge with a hip like club feel. The food-masterful flavored. The drinks-tasty and smarty mixed. The presentation-art on a plate. This place is the standard of excellence and food creativity. This place really deserves 10 stars.  **Note: If you are in LOVE with someone then this is the place to add to your loving experiences.  So, check it...I ordered the Cesar Salad soup, which was oddly delicious... the Lobster civet with lemon confit, which was crazy bursting with flavors and their sample desserts..also amazingly good! I would move to Montreal just to be a regular at this place!!! GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelor party dinner reserved at 10pm! We didn't leave until 12am. It doesn't get more classy than that. We all had the pre fixe course. The menu listed it as 5-6 consecutive pieces, but the crazy chef added twice the amount of dishes we order that in between. We had prosciutto served to us on mini clotheslines. Our Foie Gras was smoked on a piece of wood right on our plates. The best dish for me was the Lobster Cappuccino which was less of a cappuccino and more of a soup. I didn't know you can heighten the flavor of an already flavorful seafood but this chef did it.   Last but not least, big thanks to our waiter (which I'm ashamed we forgot his name). It takes the chef's dishes and our waiter's dramatic delivery of each to make the experience so spectacular. The theatricality is really what makes this high-end place more enjoyable than others. It is very pricey --the most I've ever paid for a meal but you only live once."}
{"text":"A unique experience.  We did the tasting menu with our young son, for whom they tailored an abbreviated version that wasn't at all condescending (i.e chicken fingers or pasta with butter).  The decor is dated - selecting one or two elements from each campy era from the last 40 years.  It left a question mark in my head on first arrival, but began to fit as the food was presented.  Copious courses, some of them excellent, all of them good, came in various presentations that were sometimes unique and mysterious (inside a book, billowing smoke).  The desert was over the top - we were completely unable to finish all the offerings...our son was in heaven.  The staff was very pleasant and professional and we were wanting for nothing throughout the 2 hr. event.  Overall the dinner event began as perplexing, moved to campy, eclectic goodness, and ended with us reflecting on an experience most definitely worth having."}
{"text":"Ahh...was ALMOST 5/5...I'll explain why I gave this place a 4 below  So, I needed a good place to bring my fiance to for his birthday. Something classy yet romantic. New and exciting yet delicious. Friends referred me to Europea, saying that although the food isn't worth what you pay for it, the overall experience is. So, wanting to pamper my fiance, off to Europea we went!  Upon entering, we were happy with the ambience and the nice reception we were greeted with. We were seated in a secluded area of the restaurant upstairs - something I was grateful for.   We looked at the menus, and quickly made our decision. Fiance was to take the 12 course tasting menu, and I would take the table d'hote with the fois gras for an extra $12. A half bottle of wine for $45 was also decided on (yes, 45 is a bit much for less than 12oz of wine......).  So, I won't go into ALL the details regarding the food, but I will say that we were really happy with all the \"surprises\" from the kitchen ranging from cheese lollipops and cigars to charcuterie hung from a wire by a clothespin to little sponge cakes from bordeaux and more. We were also very pleased with the presentation of all the food. Sure, they could have just put everything in bowls and on plates, but they went above and beyond to be as creative as possible when serving food.  The staff was very friendly and accommodated our requests, and although at times I wondered if it was too expensive, I decided that the service surpassed ANY restaurant I've been to in North America, and so it was fine.  My only tiny piss off was the fact that the fois gras I paid an extra $12 for was kind of gross. My fiancee gladly ate it (although the same thing was to be brought to him a few courses later). What we did instead was ask the waiter if it was possible to remove the $12 charge and simply not bring my fiance his portion. We were told that this wasn't possible. Seeing as to how I did order it, I gladly accepted that. The problem for me was when the waiter came around 2 minutes later and apologetically asked me if he could bring me a different appetizer instead (one that was part of my table d'hote). I said sure and when he asked me what I wanted, I told him to bring whatever (assuming that it was for free since he was the one who proposed). So, he brought me a bison tartare which was to DIE for. However, I must admit that I felt VERY ripped off when the bill came, and I was charged an extra $20 for this appetizer on top of the $70 table d'hote and the $12 fois gras bringing my THREE course meal to be more expensive than my fiance's TWELVE course meal!!! I didn't fuss about it because I didn't want to put a dent in our good night, but that move definitely left a sour taste in my mouth. Up until then, I was saying that I would definitely go back, but now I'm not so sure.  All in all, it was a cool experience. Would I go back?? Unfortunately no, but definitely give it a try! (I mean after all, who doesn't love cotton candy with dessert??)   I'm really sad our waiter had to put that crappy move on us..otherwise, I'd be making reservations right now for next weekend! :|"}
{"text":"Presentation, atmosphere, service, and great tasting food. This place hit it all. The creativity in presenting the food, with surprise after surprise made the dining experience extremely enjoyable. I won't go into the details and ruin the experience for you, but if you've never been, you have to check this place out.   I was lucky enough to get a reservation 2 months in advance. The place books up, so plan accordingly.   Although on the pricier side, the food was amazing, and you will definitely not leave hungry."}
{"text":"This is perhaps one of the best gastronomic experiences that I've had! Europea came highly recommended by our concierge at the Omni and I mean, who am I to question a guy who's sole job is to know the ins and outs of extra curricular satisfaction? He described Europea as an unforgettable \"experience\", and that it wouldn't disappoint as a birthday dinner. And man was he right! Two best adjectives I could use for eating at Europea would be theatrical and inventive! There were tiny beef jerky hanging off a clothes line, cheese rolls inside a cigar box, and smoking appetizers in a book! I don't want to spoil anymore surprises but the 6 course meal was well worth the price. We left stuffed to the brim unable to even finish our several desserts. Everything was well thought out and service was prompt and tremendously attentive. I do recommend booking in advance--we went on a Wednesday night and it was fully booked! The waiter told us that weekend nights they're usually booked out 4 weeks in advance. And make sure you set aside at least 2 1/2 hours for the experience. I highly recommend this restaurant and $85/person for a 6 course meal was worth every penny!"}
{"text":"The food was great  The staff was some of the best trained I have ever experienced  Our seats on the 2nd level by the stairs did shake with each person walking up and down, but the vantage point to see the hustle and flow is worth it. Plan on 3 hours at the very least to sit and enjoy your meal. Lots of courses and little tasting treats in between courses. Make no mistake, the place is a little stuffy with pomp, but if you go with the flow the experience is fun and very tasty. Its not cheap, but don't  there if your on a budget. Do go there if you want good food in a very enjoyable space. The beehive of staff movement all around you at times can be a bit disconcerting and you may feel like your in a rail station with all the comings and goings. Great wine and mixed drinks. This is a very good and creative dining experience and one not found in most cities I travel to. The desert presentation was tasty and well thought out as a cap to the meal. Fun bite size sweets surrounding a cotton candy tree was tasty and we left with both a food, drink and sweet high."}
{"text":"Europea Restaurant fed us what may be one of the most memorable meals we'll ever have.   If I were to list all of the food they brought us (it's so much more than what you order) this review would be a few pages long, so I'll resist and give you what you need to know.   This is a beautiful restaurant - very classy and romantic setting. The service is impeccable. Everyone is friendly, polite and patient (describing dishes again and again) and our server was also hilarious, with a very dry sense of humour.   Not all of the food ranks with the most delicious I've ever had, though it's all very tasty, but the creativity and artistry with which it's presented is... well it's just really something else. Once you've had a book that lets out a cloud of fragrant wood smoke brought to you to find a single piece of gravlax on lemon cream in a pastry shell inside, you can't really think of a cooler way to have salmon served to you.   Favourite dishes of the many we were brought were the tagliatelle of calamari and the lobster cream cappuccino. The madeleines and macarons we were served with dessert were also exceptionally good.   This is a very pricey night out, but even at this cost going once is worth it if you can appreciate experiencing food as a total sensory experience rather than based on taste alone. If you are all about big portions of delicious food (and I can definitely appreciate that), this might not be the restaurant for you, but I'm so glad that we got to go."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is amazing. It is a true dining experience not found anywhere else in Montreal.  Toque, Milos or Boulud do not come close.  Boulud, may have a more inviting atmosphere leveraging the Ritz lobby and all, but this is far better. The evening experience began  with grace with the parking lot attendant (next door) taking extra care of my car creating a 360 degree safe environment.  The resto does have valet, but I opted not to use it.  The environment outside is no indication of what's inside so when walking up the stairs, do so quickly so to avoid any preconceive notions. As we entered the resto, the experience began and did not disappoint t'll the end.  My date had the TABLE D'HÔTE DÉCOUVERTE 94,50 $ and I had the MENU DÉGUSTATION SIGNATURE 129,50 $.  If you want to lower the final bill, try doing so with the wine and drinks."}
{"text":"Im not clear what the hype is all about.  The concept behind the food and decor felt dated to the late 90s.   The atmosphere was repressed/quiet.  The food was so-so.  Most of it tasted pre-prepped from earlier in the week or afternoon.  We chose the degustation menu with the wine pairing.  The food had a few standouts: lobster cappuccino, the lobster scampi and the desserts.  Basically I learned that the chef makes excellent lobster stock.  Everything else was pretty unremarkable.  The cute \"surprises\" that they send out were fun, but the flavors just weren't there.  Showing me a pot with an old hen in it with some scentless steam for dramatic effect makes no sense when I receive a 3oz portion. (that said, the broth was fantastic). A smoked salmon canape in a box filled with smoke is cute but it tasted like it was made 2 days prior and seriously, it is 2012... canapes?     The most egregious problem with our meal was the wine pairing.  $65 for what was at most 6oz of wine.  We did not receive any wine until the 4th dinner item (how is this possible?).  Once we did, we had to miserly ration each sip to try to make it through the next course.   The wine service here is inexcusable.  For a $450 tab for two people (including tip) I expect much more than this restaurant had to offer.   The night before we had an amazing meal for less than half the cost at Les Deux Gamins with a much more exciting atmosphere.  The reviews here are the most misleading I have ever experienced on Yelp and leads me to believe the reviewers only dine out on vacation.   If you want whimsical mediocre food, this is the place for it."}
{"text":"I've dined at some of the best restaurants around the U.S. and abroad.  THIS restaurant now is in my TOP FIVE ALL-TIME BEST list, from the standpoints of innovation and creativity, presentation quality, food quality, ambiance, and service.  I highly recommend the prix fixed menus; also, if you can get seated at the \"chef's table\" or one of the other two in direct view of their open kitchen, it's a special treat.  Extremely pricey, but well worth it for a special occasion. My server was personable, very knowledgeable, and had a great sense of humor, too.  He assisted me in making food/wine pairings, and his recommendations were spot on.  I challenge you to find a better restaurant ANYWHERE.  A truly memorable dining experience, and one I can HIGHLY RECOMMEND without hesitation.... simply EXTRAORDINARY."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal. Outstanding service. The only meal I've had that appealed to my five senses. This was truly a culinary and artistic experience."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! Lovely experience of high dining in Montreal. The service is exceptional and the food is just incredible, delicious, creative. Went for dinner during their 15th anniversary special (April 2017). It's a pricey restaurant so this promo was great as it allowed us to have a six course tasting menu at a reasonable price.   My favourite was the lobster bisque cappuccino! But everything really was delicious!"}
{"text":"We came to Montreal for vacation a week ago to celebrate birthday. We tried the tasting menu, both food and service are exquisite. I have allergy to dairy products and they altered every dish for me so I can enjoy the food as well. Overall it was an interesting dinning experience."}
{"text":"12 course dinner. An experience of a lifetime. Every single dish was well cooked and imaginatively served."}
{"text":"So my actual score for Europea if possible would be 10/5 ;)  This was the best food experience of my life and I am not basing that on the price (I have paid much more for sub-standard food and service).  So starting with the reservations, relatively easy process requiring a credit card. I'd suggest booking at least a month in advance.  I had the signature tasting menu for $129.50 which consists of 10 courses. With a seating time of 9 pm, I KID YOU NOT, my friend and I were there till 1 am. So when I say this was an experience, it was a 4 HOUR FOOD EXPERIENCE!  I don't eat beef. So since 2 of the courses were veal, they were more than great about substituting those courses (and not with vegetables as is often done).  We were served by two people the whole night. The male server was great. I forget his 3name (we were there in June) but he was hilarious and had a very dry sense of humour.   ***Regarding the courses (NOTE: these are the listed courses on the menu - you get served additional items that are not on the menu):  Amuse-Bouche - Lobster cream cappuccino with truffle purée - both my bff and I could have had a bucket of this each  Appetizer 1) Al dente lemony calamari tagliatelle - so many textures, every bite was divine  Appetizer 2) Smoked deer tartar with thin cut french fries - this was the best dish of the night for me, the presentation was amazing, it came in glass casing filled with smoke which was uncovered with drama lol - who knew raw deer with tiny french fries could taste so amazing  - menu item was slow cooked Quebec veal carpaccio which my friend enjoyed  Appetizer 3) Foie gras au torchon, crispy langoustine, home brioche - bite-sized items with amazing flavour  Main Course 1) Macadamia nut crusted Halibut pave - this was the most delicate dish of the night - buttery soft fish  Palate cleanser - Crispy-melting white cheese ice mist sorbet  Main Course 2) Cornish hen breast cooked and scorched on maple wood chips - great presentation, they bring up a whole breast partly through the cooking process and describe the cooking method - this was my second substituted dish - the menu item is Quebec veal cheeks slowly braised and cooked in clay - they bring up the whole item as it's cooking and make you break the clay open before plating it  The Europea cheese cellar - you get to choose whatever cheeses you want or as we did it, the fromager asks about your tastes and brings what he thinks would suit your palette    Dessert 1) My passport to sweetness - cheesecake-like dessert revealed after the server melts the ball of white chocolate it's in  Dessert 2 and 3) Candy tree from Guilty land/Mignardises (mini cakes/cookies) - last 2 courses combined with a candy floss tree - we asked ours to be packed because we were literally bursting at the seams by this time  ***  Observations:  So it seems like bits of food when it comes out but we started having a hard time after finishing the halibut (after the first main course) and we are gals with healthy appetites lol. Put together, IT'S A LOT OF FOOD!! Trust me, arrive hungry.  The presentations of the courses were each like a mini-show, so pay attention - one of the unlisted items (salmon in pastry) came in a wood box shaped like a book, server opened both at the same time and smoke blew into our faces in the best possible way lol  Service is the best I have ever had at any restaurant. The servers were friendly, attentive (every time you get up to go to the washroom they replace your place setting, as soon as you are done dish is cleared way), not pretentious etc.  Very accommodating in terms of dietary restrictions. I was glad that they actually replaced the veal dishes with other meat dishes and not vegetables.  Amazing French house wine for $8 a glass!   The restaurant is rather romantic - we were the only non-couple there, other than 1 large group. Definitely a place to take a date.  At the end, you get a huge meringue, wrapped up in a bag to take home with you.  At the end of the night when we were done, as we were going down the stairs, I saw our server going down before us. When we reached the bottom, he was standing there with the door open for us (WHAT, WHO DOES THAT?!?) - Am I getting through the fact that the service was AHHHHMAZING!  I did some research before picking this restaurant out of all the high-end restaurants available in Montreal, and I ended up picking this one as it had the most unique menu items, an extensive tasting menu that gave you a bit of everything, and the rave reviews on service.  And as expected, it was a truly marvelous experience."}
{"text":"Where to start... This place is amazing. We came here for their 15th year anniversary and they had a special menu for 50$. For the experience, service and the food we had, the price was definitely worth it.   The food is amazing. All the appetizers came in a very creative manner and it was very fun to eat them. The lobster cappucino was odd but absolutely delicious.The beef/duck tartare was probably one of the best tartare i've had so far. The dessert is so beautiful and there were so many we couldn't finish them all.   The service is great. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. The place is fancy and the ambiance was great.   I don't think it's possible to leave this place unhappy."}
{"text":"Food was incredible, staff was extremely engaged and knowledgeable. It is an experience you shouldn't miss"}
{"text":"I'm not one to write a review, but I feel it's important to share our experience. We were expecting a fantastic meal, but were quickly let down as soon as we walked in. At first, we were seated at the table down the hallway from the bathrooms. I could hear doors slamming and dishes clanking behind me for the first 15 minutes. I spoke with the hostess and she graciously offered to seat us at a less distracting table upstairs. We hoped for an improved experience. Overall, the waiters were very friendly and poised, and I appreciated the creativity behind many of the small bites in between meals. The food just wasn't that good. For example, my entree of scallops with risotto was overcooked and tasted like fish food. The service was so slow that our three course meal lasted a good 3.5 hours. The meal was overpriced for the quality of the food and the outdated and worn decor. It was as though the rooms had not been touched since the artsy 90s. Overall, our recommendation is don't do it."}
{"text":"I have been this restaurant this summer with four of my friends, and we all tried its signatured tasting menu. When walking into the place, the warm and sweet interior dining environment plus the Zen feeling table decoration created a delight dining atmosphere. However, the table decoration might occupy a lot of the table space that plates had to be placed very closely.  I believe the tasting menu included around 3 appetizers, 5 main dishes, and 2 deserts. Surprisingly, we got 3 small snacks before we formally started, and 2 more desserts afterwards as easter egg. All the dishes were in great looking and showed ingenuity that we wanted to photograph every detail. But when it comes to the taste, I would say that I was a little bit disappointed. I expected more layers of flavors, and more connections bewteen different food ingredients, but I felt flat. And some ingredients did not match to each other in one dish. The service was really good and sweet. Some servers speak French, which I do not quite understand.  Overall, my dining experience was good in this place, but I would think it over whether I want to come back, considering its price."}
{"text":"We went there last night for my birthday.  And what a birthday dinner it was!  About 2 minutes after we sat down we had two amuse bouches- goat cheese and latka \"lollipops\" and mini bread-sticks.  That was followed up by 2 prosciutto \"chips\" and something else amazing.  Then we had a piece each of cheese wrapped in smokey bacon, served in the glass dome shown in a picture here on Yelp.  All that before we even ordered!    In short, this place is all about atmosphere, presentation, and impeccable service (thanks, Jack!).  The food is absolutely out of this world.  The prices are to be expected, but the \"extras\" make it all worth it.  The dessert was 5 courses, including cotton candy!  And you walk out with freshly baked mini-madeleine cookies and macaroons.  Unreal.  Drinks are good, but very pricey, so watch out ($25 champagne cocktails?  really?  thank goodness it was a special night).  I was very happy with this as my birthday dinner and do recommend it to others..    To respond to Gary F.'s review:  the portions are small because they're FULL of butter and fat and all sorts of things that if you have too much of, you'll feel ill.  We went on empty stomachs (after a 5 hr drive from Boston) and were completely full when we left."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best wait staff ever! I was dining alone and they were all incredibly attentive and funny. I hadn't read too much about this restaurant prior to arriving so I had no idea what to expect but it was literally one surprise after another. There is a lot of effort and detail that goes into each dish. The presentation was fantastic. From the little book filled with a poof of smoke to the cotton candy tree. :) I also had the calamari tagliatelle which was absolutely delicious. I liked that the portions weren't too big because with all the other small snacks and treats they brought out throughout the meal, it was already incredibly filling. I would definitely dine here again but with my friends or on a date so I can share this amazing experience with them :)"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've ever been to. They offer sample tasting before your order arrives and it's simply delish!  I had the veal cheeks that came in a clay recipient which I had to break with the hammer. The meat was so tender it melted in my mouth. The chef is truly amazing and the service was great. This restaurant will always be on my list when I visit Montreal from now"}
{"text":"Sub par and over hyped. Presentation is good but food is just okay. I would choose other local restaurants over this one."}
{"text":"A culinary feast!  My hubby and I chose the pre fix 12 course meal.  We literally dined for 2 1/2 hours.   Each dish was filled with rich intense yet different flavors.  Presentation is definitely part of the dining experience.   The staff was very nice and the service is excellent. A definite must try."}
{"text":"Restaurant Europea, ou l'art des sens...  Par Karla L.  Comment décrire une expérience culinaire où le Chef Jérôme Ferrer éveille tous vos sens? Comment noter un restaurant de ce calibre quand je n'ai que 5 étoiles à donner?  J'avais oublier combien cela pouvait être plaisant de se faire éveiller les sens. D'ailleurs, je crois que j'avais même oublié que j'en avait cinq.  Vous savez dans ce monde du fast food, c'est facile d'oublier LE plaisir que procure BIEN manger.   Dès votre arrivé dans ce lieu de culte culinaire, l'équipe vous fera sentir à l'aise en vous souhaitant une chaleureuse bienvenue, la qualité du service du sommelier, du serveur, de la jeune femme à l'entrée, était tout simplement IMPECCABLE! Un service comme je les aime: Courtois, discret, et avec classe!   Nous avons essayé (que dis-je, dégusté), mon mari et moi, le Menu Dégustation d'Est en Ouest en 10 créations.... oh là là... c'est ici que vos cinq sens vont se réveiller.  Jérôme Ferrer a concocté un menu où la vue, l'ouïe, le goût, le toucher et l'odorat se régaleront ...ainsi que votre bedon. J'ai particulièrement apprécié la présentation de chaque plat.  De plus, nous constatons que le menu a été élaboré avec soin, aucun détail n'a été négligé. Votre serveur saura vous décrire chacun des plats et même comment les déguster.   Et que dire de leur formidable sommelier, qu'avec ses descriptions, dignes d'un grand poète, vous aurez l'impression de goûter aux vins; ses proposions sont très intéressantes.   Chez Europea, vous dégusterez, savourez, vous vous régalerez, mais avant tout vous vivrez une expérience culinaire pour les 5 sens.    Je partage avec vous, quelques photos qui ne rendent en rien justice aux plats.    Ps: Croyez-moi, après cette expérience culinaire, je n'accorderai pas facilement la note 5 étoiles!"}
{"text":"We both ordered the tasting menu - the regular and the vegetarian. While the regular tasting menu was very good (loved everything except the sashimi), the vegetarian tasting was a joke, especially for the money (hence the rating). I would receive all kinds of delicious things and my husband would receive items such as four thin carrot slices sizzling on a hot brick... He almost ate the brick! The presentation was over the top and felt too gimmicky, particularly the tree with cotton candy or the big box with smoke coming out of it and a tiny morsel inside. Still, the the regular tasting menu was very good. Just don't go if you want something besides meat."}
{"text":"This was an amazing dining experience from start to finish.  The presentation was incredible. The calamari tagliatelle was so soft and tender, the halibut was perfect, the desserts were all incredible.  Do yourself a favor and try this place. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a highlight of my trip over the holidays. Everything from the service, the location, and especially the tasting menu were five stars! I've never been so full in my life but every bite was exceptional!"}
{"text":"This has been a restaurant I've been wanting to go for the longest time and all the rumours I heard didn't disappoint! This was one of the most delicious meals I've ever had. A++ for presentation,align with A++ for the different flavours in each dish! I took the signature menu of 10 courses. They might be small dishes but you appreciate the taste so much more! And by the end of 10 dishes I couldn't eat anymore! The service is EXCELLENT. The place was bigger than I thought looking from the outside.  This is one place everyone should go too at least once,not just for the food but for the experience!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Europea for our 2010 New Year's dinner. I had Googled options for a few days and it seemed like a good choice to spend the countdown at. There was a special NYE tasting menu which we of course had... ok so I lied, I wanted the tasting menu haha. Some dishes were great while some were very very bad. There was one I couldn't take another bite of because it made me (us) want to throw up. Graphic, I know... but I don't think it was the restaurant's fault. The dish had a particular cheese in it that was just so overbearing and it offended my mouth!! and I love cheese! So that was weird. The service was overattentive which is always a good thing when you are wanting a romantic evening with your squeeze for a holiday. For the money and the inconsistency of the food, I don't think I will be going back again if I'm in Montreal.... Piet de Cochon will always win my vote...but it is a beautiful restaurant. Try it and form your opinion on the place? I honestly think your experience could go either way!"}
{"text":"The menu lacks focus and flavor. Needs fewer gimmicks and more thoughtfully prepared excellent food. At the end of the meal you're bombarded with sugar in such quantities that you leave the restaurant tasting nothing but your own bile."}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance, decadent food w/wonderful wine pairings! I am not a native French speaker and the servers were just as attentive, incredibly accommodating and just lovely throughout all six(plus) courses. Sasha was especially warm w/great personality and humor while remaining very professional. THE FOOD WAS AMAZING! I'd love to share the Chef's surprises but would never want to ruin the surprise for others!  More than an amazing meal, it's a culinary experience."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD! That's the only thing I can say after eating there for the first time followed by when am I going back. The service is great and the food is incredibly good. For those that comment saying that there was no flavor, either you had a cold and could not taste anything or you've burned all of your taste buds and can't taste anything. The lobster cappuccino is insane. First you taste the cream on top and all of a sudden you get the rich lobster flavor. The foie gras, pintade And desserts were all amazing."}
{"text":"Europea was excellent from start to finish. The wait staff is attentive and knowledgeable. The food is absolutely delicious. Every course you could not ask for anything more delectable. My husband and I went here for a small trip to Montreal celebrating our wedding anniversary. This was literally one of the top three things about our entire trip. We were not expecting to have one of the best meals of our lives in Canada but we sure did at Europea.  It's also not just the five star food it's the entire dining experience. The wine list was also very very extensive and I appreciate that they had a wine connoisseur available to suggest what wines we should try. If you are in Montreal you're missing out if you do not go !"}
{"text":"Words can't begin to describe my dinner extravaganza at Europea last night. The food was delicious, the service was impeccable, and the atmosphere was lively. This was easily one of the best meals of my life; truly a magical birthday experience! Make dinner reservations several weeks in advance and arrive hungry."}
{"text":"I trekked here in 0 degree weather, in uncomfortable heels, over patches of ice - and it was all worth it. A dinner at Europea is by no means just a meal, but it's an interactive experience, akin to something like Alinea in Chicago (or so I've heard) and Blue Hill Stone Barns which I can attest to. We started with crispy cheesy \"cigars\", infused with notes of fragrant truffle, which seemed to be the theme in the beginning. Following the amuse bouche was another one that can only be described as a delicious bite of a ball of truffle and cheese; I literally just popped the entire thing in my mouth like a bubble gum. And the other courses of the tasting menu kept coming - a thick and scrumptious lobster soup in a cappuccino-like presentation (also with hints of truffle), an Asian course of fresh sashimi, shrimp dumpling, and tasty seaweed, calamari cut into noodles harmoniously mixed into the yolks of poached quail eggs, hearty scallops with a generous puree sauce, a tiny dish (I think it was a small piece of salmon?) hidden in the inside of a gigantic book, a juicy helping of cornish hen that sat underneath a dome of ... something, not sure if that was edible, but basically I took a hammer and smashed it open, revealing the hen all tender and delectable. The savory part of the tasting menu can't be beat, but the dessert was fantastical, unique, and reminded me of Alice in Wonderland. The waiter brought a large \"tree\" made of black wire, embellished with giant fluffs of pink cotton candy; it took me back to carnivals I went to as a kid with the soft strands of sugar immediately melting in my mouth. Hanging from the \"branches\" were wrapped goodies, ranging from apple-flavored marshmallows and jelly-filled cookies and macaroons - all absolutely amazing. There's more! We put whatever sweets we couldn't finish into a large Chinese takeout box, already filled with orangey petite madeleines (sigh ... yummm). And wait - there's even more! The waiter brought over a giant meringue, wrapped in cellophane, like a gift, which would have been perfect with morning coffee, but we unfortunately left that behind. Nonetheless, it indeed gets an A in my book for the exquisite food, attentive servers, classy ambience, and innovative experiences. Note that I haven't mentioned all the components of the meal, which means you'll just have to go and see for yourself! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I would give no star if they have this option! Very bad experience and horrible service! The waiters were not passionate at what they were doing at all!! They use very bad quality of tuna. To be honest, I understand not a lot of people would notice these tiny piece material they use, but we are paying for the food not a show!"}
{"text":"Europea ne figure pas parmi les meilleurs restaurants au Canada chaque année pour rien! Sa réputation est amplement méritée, et la qualité de ses repas ainsi que du service et de toute l'expérience qui entoure un passage chez Europea, valent vraiment le détour! Vous serez gâté(e) de surprise du début à la fin de votre passage, les serveurs seront aux petits soins pour vous, et vous allez manger des choses toutes plus surprenantes les unes que les autres! Les prix sont dignes d'un resto de ce standing, mais il y a souvent des promos en fonction de thème (ex. semaine de la relâche) qui valent la peine! Inscrivez vous à la newsletter pour être tenu au courant! A noter: il y a des bouteilles de vin dès 35$ et des verres dès 8.5$, ce qui est très raisonnable pour ce type de resto. Enfin, je dois dire que même si les portions sont petites, il y en a tellement que vous serez rassasié(e) à la fin du repas! vous pourrez même emporter du dessert avec vous! Bref; un must do à Montréal!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a formal place where they will impress you with the creativity and taste of the food and money is no problem, this is the place. But personally, there are cheaper options  with comparable food, if not better."}
{"text":"This was a celebratory night for me, and Europea put the exclamation point on it.  I had the tasting menu with wine pairing.  The food . . . it's been said.  There was not one dish I didn't like.  The calamari (with the poached quail egg), the cornish hen (roasted in hay) and the venison stood out for me.  The fact that the venison came close to the end and I ate it like I hadn't eaten that day should speak as to how the quality and flavors of the food just build.  The presentation and innovation were also great, but not too over-the-top.  The service is very respectful and knowledgeable.  The sommelier was awesome and spot-on; he really wanted to give me wines I hadn't tried before, and they still worked.  This place was a Per Se-like experience for me.  I'm just sorry I forgot my for-the-road goodies when I left."}
{"text":"We were celebrating a milestone anniversary and we were made to feel like royalty. What a gastronomic adventure! Such passion and imaginative, sometimes whimsical creations by Chef Jerome Ferrer in his attention to detail and not only the exquisite quality of food, but the overall experience. The \"Lobster Cappucino\" starter is indescribably delicious. Truly. That can't be overstated. Oysters Rockefeller were outstanding. Seared Scallop on a hot rock in cast iron right at the table. Very cool...and tasty! The Cornish Hen breast baked in clay pot was just a touch dry but the delicious accompanying sauce more than saved it for Cheryl. The Sea Bass filet was hands down, the best piece of fish Dan's had in 54 years! REALLY special service from waitstaff and wine recommendations from Sommelier Gaton. Simply magical dessert surprises. Literally intoxicating atmosphere and experience."}
{"text":"From the first course to the last, possibly the best meal I've ever eaten - and I've eaten at places that are more than twice the price. They expertly executed every taste sensation from savory to smoky to sweet. If you're ever in Montreal, this is a must try!"}
{"text":"I booked a table for our two year anniversary, and we ordered the 12-course tasting menu. Our trip to Europea was motivated by curiosity, and it was certainly rewarded.  As we stepped in, three tall, handsome waiters smiled at us. The first motioned for me to step forward, and the second directly me to the third after I named myself. My wobbling high-heeled feet followed the gentleman up the stairs into the elegant restaurant, where our table greeted us in a corner. Each table was dressed simply, with a flower, candle and small Inuit statuette. The menus were presented. Then food came. Fast.  First were a series of complimentary amuse-bouches, and thanks to social media, I already knew each one of them by heart. They look amazing and novel - they taste good. Was it my idealization of each item based on Instagram snapshots? The maple glazed jerky did not taste of maple, the truffle popcorn tasted like... popcorn, and I can't remember much of those little sticks dipped in olive oil. Hot, melty cheese sticks in a cigar box were offered.  Just as fast came the lobster cappucino. It was rich and creamy, just like a hot chocolate. Unlike a coffee, however, it did not pack a punch. Then came the famous smoked salmon in its enchanted box. A fun, quirky moment that was mildy diminished by the sober flavors of the bite. Beets lended the risotto their beautiful color, but not their taste. Shrimps? I think I saw two. The calamari tagliatelle was amazing presentation and \"mouthfeel\", but was way too salty (it also came apparent at this point that the masterminds of Europea really love squid ink croutons!) The foie gras was beautiful, as only an untouched product of such quality can be. It spoke for itself, and I gobbled it without its little brioche. The little crispy langoustine was the first item to really capture my tastebuds. It was crunchy, warm and bursting with flavour. The citrus caramel was a perfect touch, reminiscing of imperial rolls...?  At this point, the pace of the dinner had slowed down, and my stomach was grateful. The fish course was presented to us in its cookware, smelling of grapefruit and hay. The fish was great, and my partner absolutly loved it. The yuzu mist was refreshing indeed, and the frozen yogurt especially delicious. Yuzu can be very overwhelming and unfortunately, I swallowed the mist wrong, irritating my upper airways for the following hour. Still cool tho. The Cornish hen was my personal favorite, and I still gaze at its picture fondly every night. I broke the clay in which it cooked, scared to maim the tender meat inside. The plate was such a comfort combination, with umami-zing wild mushrooms on a little pillow of buttery mash. Another meat course came under the deceptive look of a sundae. The custard was all butter and potatoes, and the beef, although nicely acidic and savoury, made my bloated stomach wail for mercy. I thanked myself for not wearing that tight black dress.   A break was given. We were offered to either visit the cheese cellar, or name our preferences from the restaurant's impressive collection. Not able to name any award-winning cheese, we followed the... Cheese Master? The cheese cellar had, perhaps, twenty cheeses in display - those who were truly outstanding, as the Lord of Fermented Dairy explained. We chose a 6 years old cheddar, a 2015 award-winning tomme, a no-nonsense goat cheese, and le Bleu Bénédictin. Notice how the latter is the only one I remember by name. That's because I liked it so much I asked for its name, and lo and behold, the Chief Commander of Fungi and Lactose gave me another slice of the heavenly bleu.  Feeling that the second half of the dinner was definitively better than the first, I relaxed into a delightful food coma. Then came the sugar onslaught. Three courses were dedicated to desserts, and they came all at once. My partner smiled and giggled like a little boy as he picked cotton candy  leaves from the tree of Guilt. The box of warm madeleines was fresh and delightful. A fun plate of edible trinkets came, with pieces of moist honey cake, chocolate mousse, and a dollop of ice cream. As I prepared to dig in, the waiter said \"wait\", and proceeded to drown everything in liquid chocolate. I wish they had big glasses of cold milk as an option.    This 2.5 hour-long dinner had ended. We paid, a cab was called, and we were given a farewell pavlova. Thank you Europea for the amazing time, and especially to the amazing staff for making each moment perfect. Till next time my wallet is too full.  P.S. On my way out, I noticed a young man distractingly eating his calamari while reading a book, alone. I guess Europea can also be a neighbourhood bistro!"}
{"text":"Wow, simply incredible.  The great food and service did not stop the whole time my husband and I were there.  Lots of surprises that I will not discuss.  You have to experience it yourself.  We chose the 6 course meal which did not disappoint.  We also utilized the sommelier for a wine selection and he recommendation was spot on.  The service was incredible but not stuffy at all.  I would recommend that you dress nicely and make a reservation well in advance.  We tried to get a reservation only a week in advance and there were no openings.  We got lucky when we emailed the restaurant directly and they were quick to respond with two possible times.  It is pricy but well worth it."}
{"text":"This was an amazing dining experience. Very personal attention by the staff. Food presentation was fun and unexpected. But the food itself?  A. MAZ. ING. I had the veal as an entree and it was magnificent. My fiancé had the beef and said it was perfect.   And when I got down on a knee and she said \"Yes!\" The server immediately brought over champagne for us to celebrate with.   Finally, save room for the desserts. Divine.   We plan to return whenever we're back in Montreal.   Thank you for an incredible experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing culinary experience in Montreal! Food was excellent and presentation was pure art... Dry ice and smoked scallop actual smoke under the lid... Service was outstanding ... And no attitude with me walking in without reservation wearing jeans... Yes, very expensive but I think worth the experience."}
{"text":"This place is really unique. They have the most interesting and creative presentations I've ever seen any restaurant anywhere! Do you sensually use every trick in the book and Minnie I've never even heard of to make a wildly creative presentation of the entire meal. You never knew what was going to come next - and do it quite a few items that were not mentioned at all - extra little appetizers and extra desserts that were unexpected but quite welcome.  However this does come at a price. They were two of us and we each had one fixed price menu at 79+ one glass of wine at about 20. In the overall bill before tip was 250. So this is an investment.    As for the actual quality of the food some of the things were great and amazing. Some were OK. And somewhere not to my taste.   All of the questions were generally pretty small and tiny although there were quite a few extras as I mentioned. The scallop appetizer which is about $23 on its own but was surprisingly a single scallop. The fish main course was surprisingly small. The lobster cappuccino was literally a shot glass of lobster bisque with some foam. The desserts were plentiful in fact they just kept coming in that was really too much in the way of sweets. We couldn't even eat all of them and they were not really great for the diet  The overall vibe was extremely high class although most of the customers were somewhat casual. The staff was very professional and nice. However our waiter really didn't speak English well and we couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time with this heavy French accent. And he was a bit humorless and stiff - but all of the other people we spoke to were very engaging."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday last February and another time about 4 years ago. Both times were excellent. Yes it is a bit pricey but the quality of the food is next level. Everything is so tasty. We had the special 5 course meal that was offered at the time. Would go back."}
{"text":"Excellent surprise and delight. Food very good, service outstanding, great overall experience."}
{"text":"We will definitely return here. Excellent top of the line food and service. Wine was divine. They are excellent giving wine and recommendations for pairing."}
{"text":"Presentation was fantastic, food was very good. However, the service was surprisingly poor and the wine pairing for the tasting was not impressive. Overall, a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"In Montreal this place is truly one of the best dining experiences that I ever had. As a first timer, it was truly amazing on how the staff continually surprises you with these small plates of world class food that they bring to you as part of the dining experience. I had a Lobster Fricassee as the main course that was to die for. All in all, if you have a special business meeting or occasion, this will surely impress. If this place does not have a Michelin Star, it should. Don't miss this experience."}
{"text":"My preferred chef and table in town. I'm always impressed with the small details they pay attention at, the food always melt in your mouth and if you take the accords with the wine, you won't be disappointed! They change menu few times per year. Great for a business meeting, a date, to celebrate your anniversary or simply to enjoy if you are a foodie person"}
{"text":"PROS: 1. One of the most amazing and whimsical dining experiences I've ever had! Absolutely spectacular. I don't want to give away any surprises but basically each dish is a little magical show in itself and the food was delicious. Despite costing an arm and half, it's totally worth it.   2. Service is impeccable."}
{"text":"Great experience at this restaurant with the staff.  We came in last minute for dinner when some other plans fell apart.  Suggestion from our concierge for a good dinner.  Took a look at the tasting menu and the wine pairing. The menu had some dishes that we thought looked more up our alley so we opted to make our own multi course tasting menu and then challenged the sommelier to make a wine pairing to go with our made up tasting menu.  The staff was great splitting the plates and the chef did a great job of making the splits look like individual tastes instead of splitting stuff on a plate and it looking like someone just took a hatchet to it.  The wine pairings were great as well.    Overall excellent food and a great experience.  The staff made this a great experience which I would highly suggest in Montreal.  My best meal in Canada between all three cities... Quebec, Montreal, and Toronto."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that the Michelin Guide refuses to consider restaurants in Canada. Europea is quite simply one of the finest restaurants in the world, and the dining experience is worthy of every type of acclaim.   I really wanted to splurge for a dinner and when I booked a trip to Montreal, the first thing I did was make a reservation for Europea (you'll need a reservation made more than a month in advance, and if you don't show up to your booking, you'll incur a $200 charge). The style of the restaurant is fine dining, with a French-Italian focus. The dress code is \"business casual,\" but men should wear at least a jacket or tie (preferably both).   When you arrive, you'll be received into a handsome dining room, with immaculate and bilingual staff ready to attend to any desire. There was a personal note from the chef waiting at my table. I had the 8 course exploration menu, with wine pairings chosen by a sommelier. They started with an amuse-bouche of dried meat, goat cheese and maple smoked salmon lox. The subsequent courses were simply perfect, each one was served with an expertly chosen wine and the waitstaff attentively refilled my wine glass before it was even half empty. The presentation of the dishes was also impressive. The cappuccino lobster bisque changed my life, and the veal carpaccio was ten times better than anything I've had in Italy.   The menu provides an excellent fois gras and handmade pasta with quail egg and caviar. The main seafood dish was fresh halibut and the main meat dish was clay-baked veal cheek, and the tasting menu gave me an opportunity to taste both. The meal concluded with a cheese course and assorted bonbons. The total bill was about $200 per person, but I would gladly pay twice that for the Europea experience."}
{"text":"Every year, if I am lucky, I encounter a restaurant that offers a truly memorable experience. Europea was that restaurant for me in 2016, so much so that I intend to omit some details of our experience so that it is a surprising treat for you, as well. I will leave you with this sentiment: the meal is an enchanting performance so sit back and take joy in it.  I reserved well in advance, more than 8 weeks out, resulting in a lovely table by the window on the second floor overlooking the city street; during the summer, I would imagine that the area would come alive.  As we reviewed the menu, we enjoyed a robust and tasty beef jerky, flavored popcorn, goat cheese lollipops, and herbed straws served in olive oil. They were an unexpected and delightful way to begin a meal filled with surprises. These little treats definitely set the right mood.  In the end, we selected the 12-course tasting menu and were pleased with the decision. Note that a six-course table d'hôte and an à la carte menu are also available. Below are some of the items we enjoyed:  - Arancini created to look like a truffle - Velvety lobster bisque with a cappuccino-like foam finish - so good I could have made a meal of it - Smoked lentil caviar in a crispy crust (a substitute for my salmon allergy) - Risotto with baby shrimp and beets - Calamari tagliatelle served with a quail egg and a creamy sauce, reminiscent of a carbonara - this was my sister's favorite - Pâté au torchon served with a tiny brioche - A well-prepared sea bass that was cooked in sweet hay and assorted citrus aromatics - this was my favorite - Cornish game hen cooked in breakable clay that was, unfortunately, a bit dry - Clever taste of braised beef layered with béarnaise and potatoes - A cheese tray that took into account our preferences, from a cellar of over 100 choices from Quebec - A wonderful assortment of sweet treats that begged for us to take home leftovers  Throughout the 4-hour meal, the servers were energetic and playful. We thoroughly enjoyed the well-paced, thoughtfully-composed indulgences and appreciated how much the servers were very much a part of the overall experience. This meal has provided many lovely memories already so I encourage you to GO. Relish every moment of the experience."}
{"text":"I'm a foodie, and have been for the last 30 years or so, when I first became an adult, and able to pay for my own dinner.  Europea is probably among the top 3 places I've ever eaten. I judge a restaurant by food (includes taste, freshness, creativity with ingredients and presentation), service and ambience. I came here during lunch with my wife, and knew it had good ratings on trip advisor, but wanted to see for myself.   This restaurant is booked up about 10 days in advance, so I was able to get a lunch reservation because of a cancellation.   My wife and I got there 20 minutes early, they checked my reservation and escorted us to a table right away. The service was phenomenal. We had the Maitre'D and 2 servers waiting on us. They came out with Maple cured beef jerky and goat cheese lollipops, with truffle popcorn as a welcome appetizer. It was great!   We ordered a combination of things... the Calamari was sliced to resemble noodles and was so tender and tasty. I got the mushroom and chestnut soup... amazing! We both got the scallops with root vegetables as the entree; the bitterness of the root vegetables perfectly balanced out the sweetness of the scallops.   At the end for dessert, I got the chocolate and pistachio truffle and my wife got the Creme Brûlée... both were done wonderfully.  The combination of the culinary surprises, and the wonderful flavors in those dishes, married with the service gives this place 5 stars in my book. A must visit. We probably indulged too much, and had several cocktails, which set the bill high, but if we had one glass of wine a piece, the price would have been about $100... which is about what we spend in NYC for a meal that's not equal at all.  An absolute gem of a find, and if you have the opportunity to go there, you will not be let down!"}
{"text":"Words cannot describe the truly unique journey you go through on their tasting menu. I'm not even going to try. It is a show, an experience, and a memory that will last for decades.  So I will say this:  We paid $99/ea for the 12 course tasting menu, another $64 for 5 wine pairings.  To me that is a lot of money for dinner. I think this is one of the most expensive meals I have ever had.   It is WORtH EVERY PENNY though, In fact sitting back and reflecting I would value the meal I received that night at $450 per person. No joke, if tomorrow they increased the price to $299 for the 12 course meal and wine went to $149 I wouldn't even hesitate pulling out my American Express. They would deserve it. The food is so incredible and the service exquisite. I have never felt so highly valued. I think we had 3-4 waitstaff taking care of us. I tipped 45% and felt they deserved more.  This place is so good I am going to take my wife and fly non-stop from San Francisco to Montreal, have dinner and stay the night and fly back the next day.   This restaurant is truly world class. It surpassed my every expectation and I will be back annually for anniversaries and/or very special occasions."}
{"text":"We came here with our clients, who live here and recommended this restaurant. Amazing food of world leading quality and full of creativity! So many nice surprises too! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Ah-maz-ing. Completed the 12 course Chefs Tasting with Wine Paring for my birthday dinner. WOW.  We were wined and dined for the three hours, which it took to complete this meal.  Our server was amazing, attentive, and very professional.   We opted for the Chefs Table overlooking the kitchen which was pretty neat. Being able to see the sous chefs, and chef Jérôme Ferrer work in the kitchen. The way the food was presented was a big show, that was a big part of it. You just need to go and experience it for yourself.  I don't have any negative comments about our experience. I will definitely dine here again next time were in Montreal."}
{"text":"Wow! I cannot say enough about this restaurant! It was quite the experience!! The service was remarkable and the food presentation out of this world! Another reason to LOVE YELP! We would never have found this place without it.   Upon entering the restaurant, we were led upstairs to the best table in house. A second floor window seat. Even before ordering our meal, we were presented with a few tasty treats. Jerky on a clothes line, cheddar popcorn, cheese on a stick, and bread sticks with an olive oil base.   We chose the most expensive menu option. Worth every penny!  THIS IS DEFINITELY WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND!! A dinner that consisted of about 15 courses as well as a few surprises thrown in the mix. Each course was displayed in the most creative way. From a meat cooked in a clay covering served with a hammer to break the clay or your cotton candy tree displayed like an orchid I will never forget this restaurant experience. It will certainly be one to talk about for years to come!!"}
{"text":"This is perhaps the MOST memorable meal that I have eaten anywhere in the world. I was worried that the atmosphere would be stuffy and the staff would be pretentious, but that could not have been farther from the case. My husband and I came here for dinner just a week before I gave birth to our daughter and I sometimes wonder if she came almost 2 weeks early so that she could escape my womb to eat at this amazing restaurant again. *giggle*  We had the tasting menu with the wine pairing (I know, I know, so pregnant and drinking alcohol is such a no-no, but I promise you that I had just a sip and hubby was hyper-happy to finish all my glasses for me). On the night we dined here, all of the staff here, from waitress to pastry chef to the chef de confiserie (yes, a restaurant that makes its own candy, try to top that!) to the head chef were all born, raised and trained in France. Even the surrounding tables had French patrons, we were starting to wonder if we were the only non-French in the restaurant. That aside, we cannot say enough about how much we enjoyed this restaurant! It is like Disney World for your taste buds. If you are looking for a bit of a splurge (anyway, it is still much cheaper than flying to Paris to eat at a comparable restaurant. Am I right?!) and you seek a memorable and amazing dining experience, then this is a must! Upon leaving, the maître d'hôtel gifted me with Jérôme Ferrer's (head chef and co-owner of Europea) amazing cookbook. Talk about a lovely bonus and souvenir! Reservations necessary."}
{"text":"We were in Montreal for 2 nights. First night we dined at Bonaparte, it was great. Second night we dined at Europea, the food was just ok. It's not bad, but nothing to write home about. The portion for the tasting menu was tiny for the price. We ordered one bottle of wine, and it was the first time we still had half a bottle left after the main course. They tried to stuff you with cheap desserts.   The wine list is terrible. High mark up for bad wine selections. I typically leave a flat amount for tips on the wine since restaurants already charge a lot for wines and I leave 17-20% tips on food.   The service was ok. It's not particularly good or bad. But when we were about to leave, the waitress came to me to complain I did not give enough tips! I have dined at many high end restaurants worldwide and had never experienced such treatment. I do not think this is the kind of service one should expect from a restaurant which markets itself at this level.   In my opinion, this is a shoddy \"high end\" restaurant for tourists who are unlikely to return."}
{"text":"A fun dining experience. Lots of nice little surprise touches to make for a fun evening. Loved the confit hibiscus that was decoration on my drink."}
{"text":"Without question the best meal I've had. Food and service impeccable. Words cannot describe."}
{"text":"This was definitely a memorable experience. Each course was layered, thoughtful, yet playful and didn't take itself too seriously.  It's a wonderful fine dining experience and I'd love to go back if in town again. I loved each course and the service was impeccable. It is definitely worth the time and $$. For the price you get an extremely elevated and unique experience. I've definitely paid more for worse meals. You will want to make a reservation in advance."}
{"text":"4 étoiles et demi J'ai découvert ce resto dans le cadre de Montréal à table. Service: impeccable. On est traité comme des princes et princesses!  Cigare de fromage, sucette de parmesan, pop-corn à l'huile de truffe, saumon fumé (dans un boîte avec de la vraie fumée), viande fumée maison; il manque des bouchées, mais tout ça est tout simplement sublime.  Cappuccino de homard et autres fruits: ça goûte le paradis!  Soupe de topinambour: tout simple et merveilleux! Plat: terre et mer: poulet de Cornouaille et poisson surf and turf; malheureusement sec et ordinaire.  Mais ça excuse le reste, je vous le jure!  Le dessert: barbe à papa, macarons, panna cotta, crème avec fraise, etc. tout simplement à se rouler par terre!   Je vous recommande chaudement un des meilleurs resto de Mtl!"}
{"text":"Absolutely out of this world dining experience. Yes, eating here is an experience.   The prices on the appetizers and entrees are steep, but that's because all orders include many small dishes throughout the meal. No need to get the fixed tasting menu, because whatever you end up ordering will essentially become a tasting menu.  #treatyoself"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. But another disappointment yet in the foodie trip this time in Montreal. It must be because we are not used to \"good\" as defined by Montreal.  People are friendly for sure. So it's not because of service.   We had lunch reservation on a tues in May. We both got the decouverte menu. I chose to add the foie gras for $12. First came the cappuccino with lobster. Very tasty! Then the foie gras was good. Wasn't spectacular like the stuff we had in Quebec City but definitely above average.   Then my main course of the scallop came. It was not fresh and had sand all over it. My hubby had the short rib and was Terrible. It was tough and bitter. Sauce was salty.  He gave up on it after 2 bites. We both exchanged for the seabass. Filet. It was much better but not exactly tasty. I guess we have been spoiled dining all over the world.  For French food you definitely cannot beat France. In particular we loved the wine and champagne regions - Bordeaux and Epernay!"}
{"text":"This is a once per year experience, simply phenomenal. Impeccable service, the best plate presentation I've ever seen. I can't imagine a better restaurant in Montreal."}
{"text":"Amazing menu, amazing service and great food.  I recently went to Europea and entertained a bunch of clients in the semi private room, there were 16 of us in total.  Although we were all english speaking, I found everyone very helpful and the service was tip top.  All of the dishes we ordered were wonderful and a number of my clients remarked upon the fact that this was one of the best restaurant they had visited recently and  would certainly be bringing some of their clients here.  Only reason I didnt give them five stars was that my entree of deer, was slightly over cooked.  When I remarked to other diners they all said that there dish was perfectly prepared, so I think I was just unfortunate.  I would defintely return when I next visit Montreal and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"The food did not stop coming out.  The flavors!  The flavors!    I had the vegetarian \"shorter\" tasting menu.  If you want the veggie menu, you have to ask for it, because they don't present it to you immediately.  When the first two courses of the tasting menu came out, there were on a little spoon and a tiny cup.  I was worried that I'd have to eat elsewhere afterward if everything on a six-course tasting menu would be bite-sized.  But how wrong I was!  The serving sizes got progressively larger.  Each time I got a bit more full.  By the time my main course came out, I was officially stuffed.  And I still had the dessert course and the optional cheese course ahead of me.  They were incredibly accommodating to my dietary restrictions.  The main course I wanted had gnocchi.  I asked them if it was wheat and potato-based, and my server immediately responded that they can provide a vegetable substitution of mushrooms if I prefer.  I said yes, and the meal was excellent.  So many different kinds of mushrooms!    I opted to have a cheese course in between my main and dessert. And I'm soooo glad that I did.  Definitely don't skip the cheese course.  They have a cheese-man and supposedly hundreds of cheese in the cellar.  He asks you what you want - taste, texture, age, whatever -- and he brings it to you based on your ideas if you don't request something specific.  The cheese was probably one of the best parts of the entire meal.  But I love cheese (though I can't eat cow cheese anymore), so I'm partial.  He brought me two sheep's milk and two goat's milk cheeses.  My only complaint is that the dessert -- as intricate, delicious, and creative as it was -- did not flow well with my vegetarian menu.  As you can probably see from some pics, they bring you a tree with pink cotton candy, plus more small candies, plus lots of cookies, plus a custard, plus something else, and a cute box to take it all home in since you definitely won't get through it while you are there.  Don't get me wrong - it was impressive and yummy (though I could only eat a few bites), but I would have preferred if, for the vegetarian menu, I was offered something fresher, such as fancy fresh fruits, gelato, candied nuts, other cheeses, or lighter and more plant-based dessert fare without so much sugar.  The service was incredible.  I felt like a star eating there - for an almost three-hour meal on my own.  I would absolutely recommend this place, but keep in mind the dessert course if you order the veggie tasting menu.  And don't forget to get the cheese!"}
{"text":"First is worst, the second is best, third ...  Well, this is my second time in this restaurant, as I was here just about a year ago, when I was literally blown off my seat by this enchanting experience.   Going through the series of possible outcome, there were 3 possibilities of experience I would encounter: worse, same or better.  I immediately discounted \"better\", since nothing can beat that unique first experience I had.   \"Same\" would not be logical after 1 year, since everything changes with time, especially in restaurant kitchen.  By process of elimination, I concluded this experience would be lower.  Far lower, than my first experience in this restaurant. Again comparatively speaking.   Let me tell you that I could not have been more wrong.  Perhaps the very few times that I was happy to be wrong.   My colleague and I experienced a serenade of culinary appetizers, each of which was more exciting than the previous one and all bursting with flavours.    Our entire dinner was showcasing the culinary landscape of goddess Ambrosia where Food, Science and Art work in perfect partnership.    The chef must be busy experimenting to invent ostensibly bizarre dishes that were unbelievably out of this world.  So if you love to eat high on the hog, and love to have a toothsome experience, you know where to go.   And if you are invited to Europea Restaurant do like Sheryl Sandberg when she was offered a job at Google. She said \"If you are offered a seat on a rocket ship , don't ask what seat. Just get on.\"  Hmmm, I can be fussy when it comes to washroom.  Don't get me wrong.  The washroom was clean.    Not sure if Goddess Hygeia would approve though.  I would have liked to see the washroom up a notch with some innovation to match the amazingly great service standards."}
{"text":"Delicious So many amazing courses Such a nice experience I live in NYC - arguably one of the world's restaurant capitols-- and I wish we had restaurants that took as much pride in their food and service."}
{"text":"Service of the highest caliber at Europea. From a sommelier for a wine, an introduction and story for every item that reaches your table and presentation that is so often creative and on everything but a plate.  The food is delicious and the atmosphere is classy.  Highly recommend for a special night out in Montreal."}
{"text":"Dinner is a show here, and it's a good one. Style and service are top notch, but do outshine the flavor for the most part. The beginning (tuna tartare and calamari bowl) and end (cotton candy tree and white chocolate sphere) were much more interesting and delicious when matched up against the main proteins of halibut and beef.  We did the signature menu with elegance wine pairing for about C$200 per person, and after tax and tip for two came out to a total around $500. Worth it? That's up for debate. We had a blast, got very full, and enjoyed some unique flavors - for more than 3 hours. Expect to spend around 4 hours here from start to finish.  The elegance wine pairing lacked complexity and depth, but did showcase a nice variety. Don't feel too bad about passing up the wine pairing if budget is a concern.  I'm glad we did it, but have had my fill for a time.  While it did not set the bar for flavor for me, it's the gold standard for impeccable service, and carries quite a bit of entertainment value."}
{"text":"this is my favorite restaurant. Before they bring in the entree they bring you appetizers and let me say that they are all very delicious. It's like a show. The lobster cappuccino was delicious. I had veal cheeks and it was beyond amazing. Everything was phenomenal and i would definitely come to Montreal again just for this restaurant. They also brought in a note from the chef saying, \"I hope you have a wonderful time, Bon appetite.\"  Amazing place."}
{"text":"And incredible one of a kind experience! We both stuck to the prefix menu and I loved the attention to detail and the innovation of all the food, the exceptional service, and overall experience. The sweets at the end were a bit much but still took most of it home to enjoy later. This restaurant is first class!  Favorite part of the meal was the lobster cappuccino. And I don't really like lobster! Incredible!"}
{"text":"Oh dear. Where to begin?   The Europea team definitely deserves a four-star rating for effort as they did try their best to present themselves as a five-star restaurant, but unfortunately that was the exact theme for the night.... \" To Try.\" Yoda would not be pleased.   Everything from the service to the endless stream of courses upon courses had the definite perception of trying to emulate a high-end gourmand experience, but unfortunately they never succeeded in fully convincing. The decor would have been befitting in a casual dining cafe, and crispy bacon hanging from from a rack... where have I seen that before? Dishes such as the lobster cappuccino and cornish hen smoked with hay were reminiscent of signature dishes at other better-known nouvelle establishments, but arguments on originality and creativity aside, nothing was a revelation to my taste buds.   Classic case of quality over quantity - I would rather have been presented the set number of advertised courses that were executed to perfection over a myriad of so-so and \"almost-there\" bits that Europea elected to serve instead. Sadly, this is the only restaurant experience that I have actually been genuinely bored at - after about 9 courses and two bottles of wine we were ready to cut our losses and signaled the waiter for the bill.   Montreal has too many restaurants serving French classics to justify spending it for mediocre haute cuisine at Europea. We had a fantastic time at other nearby restaurants with better food at a fraction of the price!"}
{"text":"Although Canada doesn't have the Michelin rating, I would imagine that Europea would be apart of the list.  I was very impressed starting from the 3 different butter assortment which included: whipped, salted, and seaweed.  Then came two amuse bouche that were both visually appealing and delicious.  One was a clothes line which hung little pieces of Canadian jerky.  Also had blue cheese fried lollipops and truffle salt covered popcorn.  We were each given a lobster cuppacino which was kind of like a thick version of lobster bisque.  I ordred the maple infused foie gras which was additional cost but well worth it.  They give you a large piece of foie gras on top of a hot stone that cooks instantly with a capped glass dome.    Wasn't a fan of the seared scallops or the beef (which was recommended to me by the waiter). Surprisingly the chicken was actually really moist and tender and probably the best dish.   We were offered an assortment of desserts to choose from the dessert tray.  We tried the macaroon and creme brule.   They also gave us a box of warm madelines to go. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and a fun meal. My biggest recommendation is to not read too many yelp reviews since it will spoil some of the surprises that are a key part of the experience. Trust the number of stars!"}
{"text":"Europea was just WOW, WOW, WOW!!  OVERALL: If you are in Montreal, this restaurant should absolutely be at the TOP of your list. It is simply an amazing experience and a wonderful way to spend a meal. My husband planned it for our anniversary and I was blown away.  FOOD: It just kept coming! After we sat down the staff was very welcoming and would just bring us the most amazing things to sample. Some memorable items were: sun-dried tomato biscuits, delicate cheese \"cigars\", smoked salmon, truffle popcorn - it was all tasty and just the right quantity. TIP - I wouldn't get the tasting menu, we each just ordered an entrée and it was plenty of food. We spoke with other diners who got the full tasting menu and then were completely stuffed halfway through (but they all said EVERYTHING tasted great). I got the Cornish Game Hen and my husband got the steak - both were cooked to perfection and totally flavorful.  PRESENTATION: The presentation of every course of food was extremely professional.  I mean, it was up to the quality of PerSe in NYC. The staff and chef really go above and beyond to make the dining experience unique. I have been to other restaurants where this was attempted and horribly executed (like Barton G in Miami) but here is was PERFECT!!  DRINKS:  We each got a wonderfully made cocktail and split a bottle of wine which was the perfect amount.  SERVICE:  Just incredible. Everyone who took care of us was super-professional and attentive. Our waiter even went outside in the rain and hailed a cab for us!   OVERALL:  Great food, experience and people - we will definitely be back. DO NOT MISS THIS is you are in Montreal!!"}
{"text":"Definitely an interesting experience.  We had the Discovery tasting menu, and it felt like being the audience in a show where you really weren't sure what was going to happen next.  Props,  smoke,  Cuban cigars. ..it is truly a creative showpiece.    I wish that more planning was put into the way the various dishes fit together.. I found that many of the appetizers clashed, as did the mini desserts.  Highlight was the fois gras caramelized on a hot stone set in a dinner plate under a glass bell jar... Very tasty and cooked literally right under your nose!   Also the lobster bisque was perfect, the best I've ever had. So I had huge expectations of their of their signature entrée - veal cheek in a chorus sauce. But I found the meat too tender, almost mushy,  and the flavoring too salty.    Overall,  I was impressed by the presentation... but some of the dishes still have room for improvement."}
{"text":"Good quality food. Just not too many gluten free /bread / appetizer /main course options.  A bit disappointed because I left hungry."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. Their ability to create a personalized experience on a mass level is astounding. Europea is a  combination of good food and innovative design. I'm not going to describe it in detail because I don't want to ruin the experience for you but I highly recommend this restaurant, specifically their tasting menu, to anyone seeking delicious food and an awesome time. You will definitely be telling your friends about it. It was tasty, tons of fun and memorable. There was no strict dress code but I suggest business casual at minimum. A great restaurant for any celebration."}
{"text":"Went there again because our experience there was PERFECT last year, service& food WERE excellent  BUT we were just there today, all 4 of us had diarrhea within 2 hours after our meal, the service was terrible too."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré mon expérience culinaire chez Europea !  J'y suis allée avec des amis et nous avons pris le menu \" hommage à Paul Bocuse \". Étant lyonnaise, je peux vous dire que j'ai retrouvé les goûts de ma ville dans mon assiette :-)   Plusieurs petits mets s'en sont suivi entre les plats tous étonnants et excellents les uns que les autres plus l'élaboration des plats.  Toutes ces petites attentions font que j'ai adoré ma soirée chez Europea.   Effectivement le repas n'est pas donné mais nous avons profité de la semaine de la relâche pour avoir un menu dans notre budget à peu près ;-)   À faire au moins une fois c'est sûr !"}
{"text":"So we wanted a really nice dinner one night.  Being from NYC I figured this would set me back about $300-400.  Well this place came highly recommended from some fellow Yelpers, so I decided to give it a whirl.  I made a reservation from the hotel and was greeted by a friendly waiter who took our coats and gave me a special message.  It was a hand written letter from the Chef Jerome Ferrer, I've never been given anything like that to begin a meal, I was impressed.  Looking at the menu I was a bit disappointed.  I have a mushroom allergy and could not eat most of the entrees, and I hate being a bother.  I settled on a dish called Morue which is fillet of cod, homemade tomato ketchup tapenade, potato espuma and peas emulsion.  Well I'll never say settled again....it was phenominal.  We were also treated to multiple appetizers including a cheese cigar served in a humidor, a lobster creme cappuchino, and a wonderful pistachio dessert.  This place was wonderful and made you feel very special.  The waitstaff is great at what they do and you will enjoy yourself completely.  Oh and the huge bill I though I was going to have was just upwards of $200 with tip.  Very resonable."}
{"text":"I wish I could rave about Europea.  I wish I could say it was an amazing meal.  By all rights it SHOULD have been an amazing meal.  But my experience at Europea was hit-or-miss, iffy, okay, so-so, par, mediocre, average at best, and the bill was anything but average.  I spent the weekend around New Year's Eve in Montreal, and wanted to end the vacation on a high note with a spectacular French tasting menu.  Many of the city's top restaurants were closed for the holidays, but Europea and its tasting menu came recommended from several sources, so we made reservations.  We were greeted by a cold Maitre d' who seated us at a small table in the middle of the BEAUTIFUL restaurant.  A spiral staircase ending at a fireplace, bold colors and beautiful artwork everywhere.  This is the kind of space where I'd want to hold a private function.  As soon as the cold Maitre d' left, we were handed menus by a silent waiter.  He came back five minutes later and we ordered the Menu Degustation Signature\" with the accompanying wine pairing (5 glasses of wine).  He nodded, snatched away our menus, and was gone again without a word.  That kind of service continued, from him and the other servers at Europea.  At any other meal I probably could have overlooked it, but the interaction with the wait staff is (in my opinion) one of the best parts of a tasting menu.  Each dish is another interaction; instead of reading the name and maybe a description of a dish off a menu, you have the server there to describe the dish as he presents it to you, and answer any questions you may have.  But instead the servers at Europea dumped the plate on the table, mumble the name of the dish, and were off again.  Regardless of the service, here's a run down of the tasting menu and my thoughts:  Lobster cream Cappuccino with truffle shavings   Excellent!  Started the meal off right.  Champaign, France - Okay, to be expected.  Princess scallops, prepared on their shells with a porcini mushroom foam, sea water emulsion.  Amazing presentation, mediocre taste.  Late Harvest Vidal, Ontario - It was nice to see a regional wine on the menu, and I'm a fan of Niagara wines.  Very sweet, usually more of a desert wine - I was surprised to see it so early in the meal.  Pan seared foie gras, Bourbon flavoured french toast, fruits chutney and wild berries jus.  What's up with the seared foie gras???  It's a new culinary trend I don't understand.  Regardless, the foie gras was pretty good and paired very well with the wine, but the French toast ruined the dish - it was sickly sweet and overpowered everything.  White wine (I forget what it was) - Obviously, it was unremarkable.  I didn't even finish the glass (I know, I know).  Fillet of mediteranean bass, poached rice letucce, vanilla beurre blanc sauce, Abitibi-Témiscamingue sturgeon Caviar.  The bass was good, but nothing to write home about.  Light CO2 foam prepared with César Salad.  I think this dish is an example of kitchen creativity gone too far.  It was just a green foam covered in grated cheese - there was WAY too much cheese, and it didn't sit well in my stomach.  Bordeaux - This was the best wine of the flight.  The nose was incredibly, and instantly transported me back to my last wine tasting trip.  Fantastic!  Short ribs of Kobe Beef, crispy galette of roots vegetables, braised chipolini onions and baby carrot.  Highlight of the meal, although I'm not sure if it was because the dish was really THAT good, or if it was the only dish that really stood out.  Paired excellent with Bordeaux.  Our selection of cheeses.  Smorgasbord of cheeses, lots of fun - I just wish the waiter was more engaging when serving them.  A selection of desserts and sweets from our pastry chefs. To be honest with you, at this point in time I was so full, I had trouble enjoying desert.  Overall there was nothing BAD about my experience at Europea.  There were some very strong points (the venue, a couple of the dishes, a couple of the wines) and a couple weak points (service, a couple of the dishes, a couple of the wines).  Unfortunately, given the menu prices at Europea, a mixed review will not suffice.  If I spend $400 on a meal for two, I expect to be blown away, and I wasn't.  I honestly can't say that I'll ever go back, so I just can't bring myself to recommend them.  Maybe your experiences will differ, but I think for this price range, there are better options in Montreal.   Note:  if you ARE going to Europea, keep in mind that there is a \"Best Western Europa\" with the same color blue sign one block down on Drummond St, literally back to back with Europea.  If you find yourself at Europa, take a left into the alley just past the hotel, and when you come out onto Rue de la Montagne, Europea will be immediately on your left."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Enjoyed the 10 course tasting menu coupled with the wine pairing.   Every dish had a creative spin on the presentation. It tasted great also. The girl I was with was done with her wine after round 6, so I doubled up on the wine glasses from 7 to 10.   Incredible night to say the least. Bill hit $400, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"This was a true \"foodie\" experience: great service and delicious food from start to finish.  We had a table at the top of the stairs, giving us a view of all the action - including all the dishes as they came up the stairs!  Without repeating the other reviews, my wife's lamb was succulent and sweet - amazing.  I had the most unbelievable deer chop; thick, moist and super flavorful.  With the amuse bouche, breads, intermezzo, and appetizers, it's basically like having a \"tasting.\". The wine selection was top notch, and the server suggested great choices (by the glass) for each part of the meal. This meal exceeded my expectations in every way."}
{"text":"I'm struggling to decide between 2 or 3 stars. This restaurant seems to be having an identity crises. The staff is formal, the table and wall decorations are Asian, and the music is casual and pop. The food focuses way too much on trying to be novel in appearance and doesn't seem to focus enough on flavor.  We ordered the 12 course dinner tasting menu and most were very average in flavor but two that were beet based were actually gross. The first few courses were rushed and our server kept trying to hurry us and then the last few we were forgotten about. It took almost an hour to get one of the dishes. We had 2 servers during the course of our dinner. The first was very friendly even if rushing us but the second server who was bald was extremely rude and condescending. We had questions about wine pairing and he was extremely curt and abrupt. Although he seemed much friendlier to the French speaking patrons.   Overall I would not recommend this place. Staff is rude, food is average, and it's overpriced for the experience you receive."}
{"text":"I give this one star review not for the food (actually I wanna say the tasting menu is not as tasty as it used to be 2-3 years ago) but for the attitude of the door man who was standing outside of the restaurant on de la montagne street. Long story short, He stopped me rudely yesterday around 6pm, and ask me to wipe the pee that my dog left, 5 meters away from their restaurant door, on the Public walkway, when We passed by. This is just ridiculous and unacceptable. 1) my dog was not peeing on the door nor the long carpet in front of your door, but on the de la montagne street. 2) de la montagne street is a public street not your private property. 3) he was just actually posing as a normal dog always does, since he already finished his job mostly and we were waking back home (I'm living on the same street 30 meters away). 4) you were asking me to stop a dog from peeing on a street??? Seriously????"}
{"text":"We went for it and did the 12 course meal. It was pricey especially after ordering two glasses of wine but the meal will always be memorable and it was a foodie dream. We had everything from Lobster, foie gras, caviar, smoked salmon and it ended with the craziest cotton candy tree. It took us about 3.5 hours to finish 12 courses so plan accordingly. The hosts, waiters, and cheese specialist (yes, they have one) were all ridiculously professional and made this place one of the highlights in our Montreal trip."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things to do is take the afternoon off and go to Europea for lunch. I opt for the chef's tasting menu then I sit back and enjoy the next 3 exciting hours. Treat yourself to creative dishes, high quality food, impeccable service and an elegant environment. I have always found the chef's tasting menu to be extremely generous and a great value during the lunch hour. You won't be disappointed! I have been to Europea for the supper time service as well but I find it a better value to go at lunch time. Just to give you an idea, the last time we spent $500 for two people at the supper time service - but you get what you pay for :) Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Easily in my Top Five Restauarnts..a unique, amazing dining experience in the beautiful city of Montreal. I'm pretty sure our 4  course prix fix meal ended up being 10 with all the add-ons, plus the take home cotton candy and madolines in a chinese take out box. I am used to amuse bouches and after dinner treats, but I have never been to a place where I got a got the worlds tastiest 'cheese cigar' served to me in a humidor in between my app and entree. And then some slices of sashimi right after that (can't remember the fish). The food itself was really great..especially the foie...seared and finished with veal ju and a pinch of coffee, it was a really rich dish...very bold for the chef to serve it like that as opposed to the usually way of serving seared foie with some sort of fruit garnish to offset the richness of the foie. The teaser of a lobster \"cappucino\" with black truffle left me speechless. My entree of veal cheeks was really good, but maybe a tad less exciting than what came before. Then the parade of desserts...all Ii can say is..wow. And the value for all this food is amazing. I can't wait to come back and do the tasting."}
{"text":"Literally one of the best meals I've ever had. Didn't look as amazing from the outside but the second you walk in, it is a great setting. Definitely do the tasting menu. The Halibut was the best Halibut I've ever had and the lobster soup was the best lobster dish I've ever had. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"After a while i stopped counting the courses. The food was great and the service was choreographed. This is like going to culinary adventure land. The price is higher than going to Disneyland and worth it."}
{"text":"Went here on a bachelor party dinner (a little bit of classy before a whole lot of trashy). Please don't judge LOL.  ANYWAY... This is definitely one of my top-5 favorite restaurants. Best man was buying - we did the Chef's choice 12+ course meal, and it was phenomenal! I can't even begin to recount each and every item, other than each was delicious and left me wanting more.  There is some crazy twist to each and every course. Perhaps with a few the crazy twist was a little \"over the top\" and that serving could have used a bit more simplicity, but that's me being really picky... There's truly nothing that could be said negative about the flavor and excitement of each and every serving.  I'll be back - this will become my costly, guilty pleasure every time I visit Montreal. And I highly, highly recommend to anyone considering it - don't hesitate! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allé hier soir pour le menu de la semaine de relâche (40$ seulement !) et nous avons été conquis.  Je pense que ce restaurant n'a rien à envier à des restaurants 1* voir certains 2* Michelin que j'avais fait en France.  Je vais aborder plusieurs points pour expliquer cela.  L'endroit : L'Europea a commencé dans ces lieux dans une petit pièce où était servis à l'époque une 20 aine de couvert. Le lieu s'est agrandi au fur et à mesure des années et désormais le nombre de couvert a réellement augmenté. J'ai aimé cette atmosphère sereine et tamisé qui est parfaite pour se relaxer un soir. A l'endroit où nous étions placé nous étions au grand calme, cela est tellement agréable surtout dans cette ville de Montréal où le niveau sonore est BEAUCOUP trop important dans les restaurants. Premier point positif pour un repas en amoureux, d'affaire, entre amis ...  Le service : Vous avez la possibilité d'utiliser un service de valet si vous êtes en voiture. Dès que vous entrez dans le restaurant vous êtes accueilli avec sourire et on vous propose de vous débarrasser de vos manteaux pour ensuite vous conduire à votre table. Rien à redire pendant le service du repas. Je suis très pointilleux et j'étais pour ma part aux anges sur la qualité des différents intervenants. Le sommelier saura vous conseiller à merveille des vins qui sauront rehausser votre expérience de dégustation.  La nourriture : Tous les plats sont exécutés brillamment et avec une justesse de cuisson et d'assaisonnement. La qualité des produits est au RDV. Les goûts sont subtils, par exemple mon tartare de saumon était brillant pour un plat \"simple\". Cela donne une autre dimension à ce plat dont j'ai l'habitude d'exécuter à la maison :) Les amuses bouches (salés ou sucrés) sont dans la continuité de cette cuisine. Mention spéciale pour le cappuccino de homard avec sa purée de truffe, magique :) Les présentations et le dressage sont magnifiques. Il s'agit vraiment d'une histoire qui est proposée à l'hôte. Je n'en dirais pas plus pour ne pas gâcher votre découverte de la mise en scène. Vous pouvez regarder mes photos mais cela ne reflète pas comment la présentation avant dégustation est soignée :)  En conclusion ce restaurant mérite très largement la palme du restaurant gastronomique de Montréal. Il s'agit d'une réelle expérience, aussi bien culinaire que de service, que chacun devrait avoir vécu au moins une fois si vous passez sur Montréal.  Je ne peux que recommander fortement pour toutes les raisons que j'ai décrite :)  Nous y retournerons sans hésitation pour notre part."}
{"text":"If someone else raves about this place, then tells you they will pay for your meal here, you may regard it more highly.  Aside from finding bits of lobster shell all in my lobster dish (and having this met with a shrug from my server), most of the food was good.  The challenge here is that it is just good. For a premium price, the menu, service, and restaurant seems 2002. Nothing stands out, though everything seems familiar enough and increasingly better with wine.  There are many places I enjoy when I visit Montreal. This is not one I would want to visit again. There are equally expensive options with better food, service, and experience."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was incredible. However, some of the courses are not that tasty. But they all look fancy anyways. I like the risotto and the lobster coffee. The foie gras was fantastic. I love the place anyway."}
{"text":"Wow.. this is a true 5 star and this is what you would call an Experience- Restaurant! They are wonderful hosts and they know all about service. Even before you fully read and order from the  menu, they bring little amuse-bouche to the table and each of them are utterly delightful. I ordered the foie-gras (the best I have had), sea bass (cooked to perfection), and the dark chocolate ganache with coconut shavings (was awesome). Even with the 3-course meal, all the other interim food, made this a very satiating dinner. It was a 3hour dining experience with not much alcohol. If you are pairing with drinks, it can be an even longer memorable experience. True jewel of Montreal!"}
{"text":"Cet avis est basé sur mon expérience durant MTL à Table.  Aïe, aïe, aïe!!! Quelle expérience extraordinaire! Ma meilleure amie et moi avons décidé de se gâter pour nos anniversaires en se payant un petit souper au Europea et MTL à table est certainement le moment le plus accessible pour le faire.  Du début à la fin, le service était impeccable. Courtois, bien informé et extrêmement professionnel. Le nec plus ultra! La serveuse s'est même assuré qu'il n'y avait aucune allergie alimentaire avant de commencer le service.  Un menu était prédéterminé pour l'événement et je crois qu'ils ont vraiment mis le doigt dessus, tout les choix étaient PARFAITS!! Dès le départ, nous avons reçu un assortiment de bouchées. Boeuf séché, cigare de fromage et pop corn aux truffes (j'en mangerait un sac format cinéma de celui-là! Ensuite, nous avons reçu un Cappuccino de crème de homard, purée de truffe avec du pain chaud et des beurres maison. Absolument fabuleux. Tellement onctueux et \"homardeux\" que je ne saurais décrire mon expérience! Ensuite, un carpaccio de veau de lait du Québec avec une crémeuse au thon parfumé et mesclun de pétales de fleurs, très beau et surtout très bon. La meilleure partie du repas selon moi! Après ça, nous avons reçu un velouté de topinambour et porcinis avec du foie gras au torchon à la râpe. Ma copine n'aime pas les champignons alors j'en ai hérité et c'est tant mieux, c'était délicieux! Et ça continue, (j'aurais jamais dû manger le pain haha) on reçoit un Terre et mer d'un croustillant de langoustine et poitrine d'une poule de Cornouaille, perso j'aurais pris juste des langoustines, la poule c'était bon, mais sans plus.  Finalement, une quantité massive de desserts... macarons, guimauves, financieurs, barbe à papa, meringues, madeleines.... et j'en passe! On est sorties de là 30 lbs plus lourds mais excessivement heureuses de notre aventure!"}
{"text":"A little more whimsy than I normally prefer in a meal, but everything was very good. The \"cigars\" to start the meal were fantastic.   Definitely would recommend the tasting menu, though some of  the options that were not on the tasting menu looked delicious as well."}
{"text":"Europea is beautiful. Every seat is lovely and you will be happy regardless of where you are seated. The service is perfect, I mean perfect. They know everything about the menu and the wine list.  The food is some of the best you will ever have. It is all made from fresh ingredients and the presentation is amazing.  From start to desert you will be glad you came. Leave yourself a couple of hours to enjoy all Europea has to offer."}
{"text":"Great attention to detail! It's not the first time I go to Europea but there's always such an attention to detail during service and great care. The food is quite classic but very good."}
{"text":"I am banging out some long overdue reviews and had to put in 5 stars for Europea.  Enjoyed the tasting menu with a good friend in 2014, but still remember the meal fondly as if it were last night.  Creative, confident food that truly reached WOW FOOD status.  Two bottles of excellent wine and 12 courses from Lobster, foie gras, caviar, smoked salmon to a picture worthy cotton candy tree.  To this day, one of my top 5 meals of all time.  Compares with E' by Jose Andres, Gabriel Kreuther, and Mario Batali at his best."}
{"text":"This one is going to be long.......just warning you. So this was the 1st time I've ever been to a restaurant that provides the tasting menu options, either $89.50/person for the 6 course or $119.50/person for the 12 course. Either way, you're getting a large variety of dishes to quench your palate. The way it's explained, the 12 course option has dishes 1/2 the size of the 6 so you get the same amount of food, however, in between they bring little amuse bouches so it's definitely more food.   The service is what you'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber, very attentive and helpful. I will say that my experience in many Montreal restaurants lead me to believe service is not in their vocabulary but Europea was truly an exception. We had 13 people at our table, some a little more demanding with their food....\"less sauce, no sauce, this or that on the side\", etc. No problem, they accommodated everything. For the vegetarians there is a separate tasting menu and they even allowed to pick and choose some items from the vegetarian and some from the regular. Each dish is carefully placed and then explained to the group in perfect detail.  The food was outstanding! We all had the 6 course meal. They start with a variety of amuse-bouches such as peppered jerky, cheese lollipops, assorted butters and breads, flavored popcorn and more. Then to prepare you for the amazing meal to come, their signature lobster bisque cappuccino arrives.......holy crap! It's worth going to Europea just for that.  You then get to choose one of 3 appetizers and one of 3 main course. The portions are quite large. My ricotta ravioli with sauteed mushroom, truffle sauce and pan-seared foie gras was to die for, fortunately it didn't come to that. The breads are all freshly baked and amazing, I did not need to have 3 pieces of the french baguette but I never let that stop me.   They also do some very unique dishes.....one amuse-bouche is a box that looks like a book. You open the book and out comes this amazing smokey smell like logs in a fire and it reveals a tiny but delicious salmon in a small cup, I forget what else was it it but it was really good.   Then comes dessert, also a barrage of little dishes that includes sorbet, cotton candy tree, panna cotta, a variety of macaroons and cookies, caramel and nut cheesecake lollipops, nuts, coconut marshmallow squares and more.   I will admit I was surprised by the quantity of food. I'm not a small eater and fully expected to have alot of small dishes and to leave hungry.....boy was I wrong, I left stuffed.   Europea is worth the visit, however be prepared for a long night. It's not because the service is slow, it's because the food just keeps coming and you can't wait to see what they bring next. Not the place to go if you need to catch a movie. However, if you want a really nice restaurant with great food and that allows you to spend time with the person or people you're with, this is the perfect choice."}
{"text":"Spent my birthday there , everyone was so nice !!5 stars service and amazing food presentation!!! As a true New Yorker and used to live in Tokyo, being spoiled by quality of food is normal, among those Michelin starred in New York, Tokyo, Chicago, San Francisco , the food presentation of this  restaurant amazed me !  Each dish came with all surprises !!! To be honest , Dishes from chef was amazing , however when it comes to main dishes , they are Good , I will give 4 of 5 stars, taste is very personal , just like I will not like all dishes even from one of my fav Michelin starred restaurant anyway. I will definitely come back for other dishes on the menu!!!!"}
{"text":"Very elaborate dishes. Over-produced and overly rich for my tastes.  Any attempt to get a healthy meal here is a real challenge, if not an impossibility."}
{"text":"We went to Europea for their lunch. For $35, it was a truly amazing gastronomical experience.  Upon arrival, I was amazed by the interior decor, it was as fancy as a Michelin starred restaurant. The service was also impeccable, the server took my coat and my shopping bag.  We first got the complimentary beef jerky, then the lobster cappuccino, the salmon starter followed by the scallop and ended with a dessert of your choice.  I have to say, all the dishes were very creative and presentable, which elevated the entire dining experience. However, even though the dishes were feast to my eyes, not very much to my tastebuds. There are other restaurants in Montreal with better tasting food. And their dessert were lacking flavours.  Still, I would definitely come back to Europea, I enjoy their artistic touch to every single dish, their classy ambience, amazing service and just a fantastic meal with friend.  Strongly recommend this restaurant if you don't feel like joining the tourists in old Montreal."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to celebrate our ten-year anniversary after a recommendation by our hotel concierge.   Words simply cannot express how wonderful our experience was.  The dinner was without a doubt the highlight of our entire week in Montreal.  We splurged and both had the tasting menu, which is an absolute steal at under $100 each.  Throughout the meal we kept commenting on what a great deal we were getting!  Eating at Europea is a total experience - it is not just a culinary experience; it is also completely entertaining in every way!  Starting with the food: it was absolutely delicious, everything we had.  I just kept saying to myself, \"I didn't know my tastebuds could feel this way!!\" But on top of that, it was so creative.  Each piece brought out was a work of art.  We had just as much fun discovering what was next as we did eating it!  The waiters are also courteous and humorous, and I laughed out loud on many occasions.  Months later, we are still raving about our experience to everyone.  We could not recommend Europea more highly!"}
{"text":"Last night in Montreal, and Restaurant Toque was closed for the holidays and Au Pied du Cochon was booked...So, Europea was next in line. It was a tough choice between the other contenders...and there are so many good choices in Montreal. But i only had limited time and money. So, here it goes.   SERVICE was 5 stars....our experience was very positive from every staff member. i forgot to mention, i went with my wife and 6yr old daughter.. we ordered Ala carte for our daughter, while my wife and i had the tasting menu. They still brought out some soup, amuse bouche and desserts for FREE for my daughter. They were Very friendly, accommodating to my daughter and attentive to our needs. They anticipated every need...water was never empty or low, offered more wine when my drink was low, silverware replaced consistently, chef Ferrer comes out to greet us, Host comes by to check our satisfaction, the wait between dishes was well paced and presented well, and our jackets were waiting for us when we are about to leave the restaurant. No attitude, and very generous.   Ambiance- The restaurant was very nice and tasteful....it feels very romantic, clean and well designed. 4-stars for this.   FOOD- unfortunately, after eating at other heavy hitting places....the food here seemed pretty average. So 3 stars for this..... Everything was good....but the flavor is rather average...nothing really blew my mind.   So, blow by blow account....   Bread/butter - 4-5 kinds of bread....but all of them seem to be the same kind. i had the olive bread and fig bread. It was a bit salty also.  Parmesan crisp lollipop- nice texture.  lobster cappuccino- i was expecting a thick lobster bisque...but i guess that is not the point in calling it cappucino...coz' it really had the consistency of coffee. its good and light...and would be better if he pronounced the truffle more.  Foie gras- Awesome! this was done perfectly...and i love this preparation as well.  Cod-this was good, very light, you can taste the flavor of the fish...has a bit of a mackerel flavor.Not sure what the sauce did...it was rich but not memorable.  Mediterranean bass- this is basically sushi. Its good...but Im a big sushi fan, and Ive had better white fish than this...he should've used some truffle oil....and bring out the flavor more.  giant scallop- again, this is another great dish that could use more flavor... bearnaise is just too bland and rich.  cornwell chicken- great presentation, but very plain...very traditional. I wish he included some darkmeat and whitemeat to contrast the texture and flavor. Flavor is very clean and brings out the fresh chicken flavor.  Fresh mushroom ravioli- love the truffle sauce! TRUFFLES!! i wish i had more of this...  Smoked short ribs- wins best presentation by bringing it out in a smoked cover....but flavor was very typical...i wish he used pork belly instead....short rib could be more tender melt in your mouth...but it was very grainy. The galette of root vegetables also didn't work well with it...  Cheese- not much selection...actaully, we didnt even choose...only 2 kinds were brought out with some nuts and jams...it was the perfect amount since we were getting full.  Dessert was very good- probably the best part. It was simple and very familiar....frozen parfait, sugar coated marshmallow, macarons, sorbet with marangue...etc. Love them all!   So, im not sure if im just jaded....but i would rate Europea in the middle. Not bad by any means....and i would love to return....The price is very reasonable for the amount of food you get and the quality you get....it just did not show enough definition, or any stand out flavorto it....presentation gets all high marks...but it was just lacking in flavor...they played it too safe by sticking to a more traditional flavor range........the wine selection is very good,...i had a bordeau...which was fantastic.... and with the great service and staff...i think it gets a well deserving 4-star."}
{"text":"We enjoy our every bite. Very unique and creative! Great dinner, great staff, fantastic service. 5stars!!"}
{"text":"I went to Europea for lunch with two friends. We ordered the 5 services tasting menu with wine pairing.  The amuse bouches were nice but there were not many as some of us with allergies had our servings taken out without being offered anything else. Our orders were taken promptly and two plates of butter (not three) were brought but we had to wait and finally ask for the bread. The lobster and truffle cappuccino was nice but not memorable and my waitress spilled some of mine on the table, it was not cleaned nor replaced. We were also disappointed with the first wine that was served. The squid pasta was a nice play on texture but we enjoyed the foie gras most with the langoustine crunch and the wine that was served with it was very nice, we just wished there would have been ore than one tiny brioche with it. The beef was also good although I asked for saignant and got à point but it remained succulent. They had barely cleared our plates that the desserts came out. The madeleines were very good and the cotton candy was a nice touch but added nothing taste wise. The lemon verrine I found too heavy and none of us enjoyed the thick shard of sugar. Still for the price it is a good value for lunch, but I did not think service was great and we definitely were rushed to finish our meal."}
{"text":"The evening started off great! Great service and the amuse bouche and the small dishes in between the courses were unique and tasted so good. The lobster cappucino was delicious. My husband was happy with the wines he tried. We really liked the panna cotta that was served with the other little desserts at the end.  Where they lost points was the the slide in service once they got busy. We purposely came at 6:00 pm, knowing it would take at least 2 hours for dinner, which I don't mind because I didn't expect anything different from a high end restaurant. We don't like to feel rushed. Back to when they got busy....the attention was lacking once we hit our main course. Main course was a disappointment in comparison to the flavours and presentation of dishes prior to. I tried their lobster and sweetbreads, which was not bad, but the flavours were a bit off. I can't quite put my finger on what exactly, but the flavour of the dish wasn't great. My husband ordered his steak medium-rare, but it came medium-well to well. We would have indicated this had we been checked on. But alas, our server did not come around until he had already finished the meal to ask how everything was. When we mentioned about the steak, he basically said \"oh, ok\". That's it. I would expect a place like this would offer some type of compensation (I'm not expecting a free meal or anything, but at least offer something to keep a patron happy).  That was one point lost there.  Then, there was my husband's entree (appetizer). He had ordered the scallop with radish ravioli. The menu suggested it was an XXL scallop. When it came out, it was more like a medium sized scallop, which would be ok had they not said XXL. Another point lost.  Finally, they mentioned on the menu that you can ask for a tour of their kitchen. I was interested in this and asked about it just before the main. Server said they'd be delighted and will speak to his manager to arrange this. At the end of our meal, we just received our bill and he said have a nice evening. I expected more for what you paid, so another point docked.  This place really had great potential, but fell short in certain areas that cannot be overlooked for a place you're paying $300 for two people. We've definitely had better experiences elsewhere. We would give it another try, but probably wait a few years as their menu choices are pretty limited and doesn't seem to change.   Tip: If you don't want to go all out with the tasting menu, go for ordering off the regular menu and not the Table d'hote. You get the same experiences either way with the small dishes in between. The only difference is you get a dessert with the Table d'hote (which wasn't great and you basically pay regular price for it). Also, the options for the main under the Table d'hote is limited. I didn't have the Table d'hote and just ordered the foie gras for entree and lobster and sweetbreads as the main."}
{"text":"This place is totally 5 star....amazing food...and it was a great experience too....it was like a 12 course meal of french cuisine....beautiful service with amazing taste...it was our friend's birthday...and he throughly enjoyed the food....this place is a must go...highly recommended...."}
{"text":"It can be a challenge finding a good place to eat on a Monday night, since so many fine dining restaurants are closed. We had hoped to try Toqué! but they were closed both nights we were in town. Europea was open and we were able to get reservations, so we decided to give it a try. The restaurant has an elegant interior, and the night we were there it was mostly a business crowd, so we felt slightly underdressed. We both got the chef's tasting menu with wine pairings. The menu is inspired by Québec's fresh produce. Presentation was excellent on all of the dishes; if I hadn't been to a place like this before I would have been more impressed, but we were a little underwhelmed as we've had better in LA (most recently at Gordon Ramsay), especially for the price. But it was still very good. As best as I can remember, our courses were as follows:  Amuse bouche: goat cheese mousse with risotto and bacon Lobster cream cappuccino with truffle oil Princess scallops, prepared in the shell with morel mushroom milk, sea water emulsion, parsnip purée Duo of pan seared and torchon foie gras Light C02 foam prepared with César salad Surf & turf (medallion of milk fed veal with a crust of herbs pesto, langoustine ravioli with confit tomatoes, sautéed girolles mushrooms Cheese plate 2 dessert courses  The desserts were extremely elaborate. Our first dessert course included panna cotta and a huge 3-tiered tray of bite-sized desserts, including maple marshmallow, chocolate-covered orange rind, chocolate-covered strawberries, apricot jelly pistachio tart, etc. Our second dessert course included a chocolate pot de crème with espresso foam and butterscotch ice cream.  Probably my favorite dishes were the scallops and the langoustines, and my least favorite was the veal, which was slightly overcooked for our more bloody tastes. Foam was used in several dishes (it is molecular gastronomy after all), which may be a little gimmicky but I'm not complaining - actually the caesar salad foam dish was fairly interesting, and the foam that came with the scallops was an excellent complement. For our cheese course a large table of cheeses was brought out, from which we got to choose 4, so we chose all of the local Québec cheeses that they offered. The wine pairings were somewhat uninspired in our opinion, but we did enjoy the Barolo that was served with our surf & turf course, and I appreciated that they served a local Canadian sweet wine with the foie gras course rather than the traditional Sauternes. There were only 4 wines served with the 9 courses, which on the one hand comes across as not enough, but on the other hand it was nice to still be fairly sober at the end of the meal.    Personally I don't need to go back anytime soon, but it was a good dinner overall, and it seemed like a good place for a business dinner or a date if you've got money to spend."}
{"text":"The best meal of our trip here to Montreal.  Food was delicious, atmosphere was nice, service was perfectly timed and wait staff paid excellent attention to my entire family including two twelve year olds who know how to eat.  Make reservations and you won't be disappointed.  The food was creative, with many excellent extras such as lobster cappuccino, risotto balls, smoked salmon, and a passion fruit panne cotta for pre dessert.  The presentation was really neat for many of these extras.  For main dishes, the steamed sea bass was particularly delicious as was the beef  entree.  The food was cooked perfectly.  The cotton candy tree was a particular hit with the girls.  My wife and I had the fixed price 3 course meal and the rest of the family just had entrees.  With all the extras that we all had, we were stuffed by the end.  The size of the entree portions for the fixed price meal were the same as the individual entrees.  They also offer a tasting menu which is about 8 courses.  The wait staff were knowledgable, helpful but not obtrusive.  They made us feel at home and treated my kids equally as I'm sure they don't always get younger patrons.  If we come to Montreal again, I will remember to make dinner reservations here.  Well worth it."}
{"text":"We wanted to try Toque last weekend, but they were closed on Sunday. We were told Europea was one of the best in Montreal and were very, very pleased. It was by far on of the best meals I've had. We had the 5 course tasting menu, but we ended up getting a lot of \"surprises that would come out of the kitchen in between the courses. The most memorable dishes we had that night included the lobster bisque cappucino,  crab ceviche and the beef cheeks.   The vibe is very chic. This meal would have been double the price if it were in the states. We were very impressed by the wait staff and had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Over the top perfection. We had the larger of the tasting menus at our table of five. We had trouble deciding what items were our favourite because there were so many excellent things. It was a long and perfectly enjoyable experience.  Among the favourites: lobster cappuccino, calamari pasta, Cornish hen, sea bass, cotton candy and pop rock/chocolate hazelnut sucker."}
{"text":"Nice decor, but other than that the food was just mediocre. Perhaps I should have gone with lower expectations. The service was in line with the type of service I would expect for this type of restaurant. Unfortunately, I would not return again. The foie gras was good as most places. Nothing special about it. The lobster cappuccino has been done before and this version doesn't stand out. I ordered the steak medium rare. It came out medium well so I returned it. They offered to redo it but I decided it was not worth the wait. At this price point, this kind of mistake should not happen. The desserts were presented in unique ways but the taste was just okay. I think this place tried too hard but failed to live up to expectations. Relax and focus on taste."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best meal and dining experience I have ever had!  The service, presentation, and food were all incredible.  I particularly enjoyed the smoked salmon, presented in a \"book\" filled with smoke, and the dessert presentation of cotton candy on a \"tree\" with assorted sweets under it.  There were numerous tastings, all creative and delicious, and accommodating of my food allergies.  Although we ordered (and paid for) only two courses, we received about ten altogether.  What a fabulous introduction to the city!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious. The service is meticulous. The presentation is off the charts. The only potential issue is that it is expensive. However, it is well worth the price and does not disappoint."}
{"text":"I have been trying to described what Europea is and settled on theater where the different courses are the acts.  Simply super, presentation, quality, service, attention, flare, sophistication and on and on. Still in awe of the experience.  I was there with a group on a Friday and the place was packed. By far one of the best restaurants in Montréal with a great wine selection.  A great place to celebrate a milestone in your life."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. All I'll say is that you will keep getting stuff brought to your table, stuff that you haven't ordered, it's on the house. Your time there will be full of surprises! Worth it for a special event in your life! Great fine dining experience!"}
{"text":"I was greatly looking forward to dinner at Europea but left sadly underwhelmed.  The service was amazing, the presentation of the food was beautiful, the cocktails (and wines) were delicious, and all the amuse bouches and little touches they give were great...but the food itself was underwhelming.  We tried the $120 tasting menu (I think 10 courses in all) and weren't really blown away by any of the dishes. The only things I would recommend ordering from the tasting menu (which you can order separately!) are the lobster cream cappuccino w/truffle puree and either the sea bass filet or the clay pot cornish hen entree. Everything else was forgettable and didn't challenge or inspire my palette...or otherwise move me in any way.  Such a shame because the restaurant is beautiful and the service is wonderful, but the price tag is too steep for a forgettable meal.  (Also, I noticed someone commented on the poor state of the restrooms and laughed it off. That comment was completely true and warranted. When I went to the restroom, there was urine all over the seat AND floor - something I don't expect to see at a fast food restroom, let alone a place as pricey as Europea!)"}
{"text":"Was worried that those who wrote the bad reviews were right...and they were!  Glad that my friend and I went for lunch instead of dinner as I would have been pissed paying so much more for just ok food.  Choice of $60/5 course meal or $45/4 course meal...glad we did the $45 one as I thought it will wasn't worth the price.  Started with the amuse bouche which were meh. Truffle oil drizzled popcorn didn't taste much better than the cheese popcorn I would get out of a bag bought at the supermarket...as a matter of fact, the popcorn was stale! Pesto lollipop...didn't like the combination. The only item that was decent in the amuse bouche was the beef jerky.  Started with a lobster cappuccino...ok that was really fantastic...but you can really feel like they put in tons of butter. Anything with butter is good right?  Entree was smoked duck with beef...nothing special. Presentation was nice but taste was ordinary. The shrimp cannoli was ok but again taste was not memorable.  Main was scallop with asparagus risotto. Scallop lacked a bit of salt and the risotto was bland. The entire dish was actually bland. I ate the 2 scallops and a bit of the risotto. The bar was actually decent in taste but again could taste tons of butter in the sauce.  Dessert consisted of a cotton candy tree, some meringue, madeleines, and some sort of strawberry mousse cake with a thick coat of sugar that you need to crack before getting to the bottom of the cup. I wished I didn't mixed in the hard top sugar because it was just too much and it got stuck in my teeth and didn't add anything to the dessert.   I've seen tons of pictures on Yelp about the dishes and they have not changed a bit. I feel like the menu hasn't been changed in ages...really lacking creativity.  I must agree with the lower reviews that pricing is steep and taste is forgettable! Decor isn't even that nice.  Montreal has tons of great restaurants so spend your money elsewhere.  It might have been a great restaurants a decade ago, but it has not evolved and lots of better choices now."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I have never and probably will never again eat as well as I did in my life. The atmosphere was fantastic, service was superb, and the food was out of this world. My friend and I went and split the 12 course meal and one full meal. They give you, I think it was 5 different tasting just for coming there. So it was really like a 17 course meal. Every single course was an experience. And every single course was amazing. This was the best restaurant I have ever been to. Simply amazing."}
{"text":"L'une des meilleures tables gastronomiques à Montréal. Service impeccable. Petites attentions, surprises du chef, l'endroit maîtrise parfaitement l'art de recevoir. Cuisine savoureuse, généreuse et créative. Un chef d'oeuvre dans votre assiette. Le Chef Ferrer peut en être fier!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic culinary experience. The food, the wine, the service, impeccable.  The food presentation was creative & fun. Each course delicious. Highly recommend. One of my top 10 meals."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I don't usually do fine dining- this is a perspective of a frugal gal who is always thinking if she's getting a good value...  ....and indeed this restaurant experience was of good value! We wanted to do dinner but didn't know that people would be reserving weeks in advance. Luckily we found a time open for lunch. We ordered the $45 four course meal, but they serve many complimentary things which made me happy (I like free things).  Because it took me a long time to research what was complimentary, here's a rundown:  -Complimentary Appetizer includes prosciutto/beef jerky on a clothes line , goat(?) cheese lollipop, flavored popcorn, and bread (duh) with 3 kinds of butter.  -complimentary cotton candy tree and fresh baked madeleines at the end   Don't get me wrong; these comp items are not huge at all (except for the cotton candy) so it's not going to even make a dent in your hunger, but because they are so creative and they are nice surprises, it makes me happy.   As for the 4 courses that we each ordered, portion sizes were good enough that we were pretty full at the end. And the service was excellent. I would come back again."}
{"text":"As fun as food can get, and delicious as hell! Service is amazing - and all in all this place delivers. Just go already and stop worrying about the $$$"}
{"text":"True, I don't know a lot about the dining scene in Montreal, but Europea far exceeded my expectations. Their lobster cappuccino is quite possibly the best thing I've eaten all year (the flavors, texture and presentation come together to create the perfect, cozy, luxurious experience) and the service is one of the most refined combinations of both friendly and attentive that I've yet experienced.  Yes, some of the dishes could be construed as gimmicky (the prosciutto chips hanging on a clothesline were more fun and adorable than culinarily masterful), and the wines all start at a very high price point, but the hits and the overall experience more than make up for these hiccups-- especially at the extremely reasonable price at which their smaller tasting menu is offered. Every course, expected and unexpected, came with a fun twist (the smoked salmon canapé that arrived in a faux hardbound book infused with a savory woodsmoke that came floating out into my delighted face as I lifted the lid; the \"sunny side up egg\" that came for dessert that was actually a small poached peach surrounded by a coconut champagne emulsion) and every detail, from the trio of creative butters that accompanied our bread to the bite-sized freshly baked chocolate madeleines that we received to take home, was beautifully soignee. I don't want to write too much more as for me, a large part of the joy of the evening was the element of playfulness and surprise throughout-- all I can say is that I would highly recommend Europea to anybody who is delighted by a unique and memorable dining experience!"}
{"text":"I'm still not sure why it's taken me so long to write a review about the best meal I've ever had. Back when my husband and I were living in NYC, we decided for his Birthday in May 2015, we'd drive to Montreal. It's about a 6 hour drive, 9 if you bring your Beagle with you because you want him to have international status.   I made the reservation a couple weeks in advance noting that come he'll or high water, we were going to do the Tasting Menu. And I am so glad we did.   Here's why:  Firstly, they take you thru a journey. I always thought when people said that, it was cheesy, but the only think cheesy about this restaurant was the cheese cigars and the goat cheese truffle. The waiter really takes you thru the courses (of which I lost count after 9 including palette cleansers and amouse bouche plates). Here's an example:  Waiter (holding what appears to be a book): \"would you care for some light reading?\" Me: \"ok!\" Waiter sets down book: \"please now open your book.\" I open said book to a plume of smoke from the burning apple wood in the book and a goat cheese truffle drizzled in squid ink (I think?). Either way, explosions in my mouth.  Oh! And:  Waiter: \"would you care for a cigar?\" Me: \"um.... a cigar?\" Waiter opens a humidor: \"a cheese cigar.\" Presenting a Camembert Fried cheese stick.   I'm not doing the food justice as it was such an incredible night of flavor and presentation. I never thought having dinner could be so much fun, but Europea has become my favorite restaurant. I live in Napa now, so it's not easy to go to dinner there even on a weekend trip to Montreal, but it's on the list of next trips and I guarantee you, Europea will be the main event.  Takeaways from this review:  Best restaurant ever Cheese cigars Light reading"}
{"text":"This place is definitely unique and one of the dining hallmarks of MTL. Let me preface this by saying that just based on the taste of the food itself vs price this place would likely be a 4-4.5 out of 5, as the taste wasn't mind-blowing and I've had some similar dishes elsewhere for cheaper. However, this resto kills it when it comes to unique presentation and service, honestly that's what its all about!  Examples: dessert was a \"tree\" with cotton candy as the leaves and pastries on the branches. One appetizer came in a giant book instead of a plate and had smoke coming out when you opened it.   Honestly, the restaurant gets away with some really crazy ideas that somehow still works. It'll confuse your taste buds but you definitely won't (shouldn't) dislike it! I had the bass filet with beet noodles which apparently was one of their signature dishes and it was really really good and freshly steamed! The portions may be small but if you do their course menus you'll definitely be full. Go for the food, stay for the experience."}
{"text":"We have been going to Europea for three years now, whenever we are in Montreal.  The food is amazing, and a 10 course tasting menu is under $100 which is a great price.  That being said, the service is just amazing.  They are attentive and patient, making you feel like the center of attention throughout the night. The dishes were delicious and well thought out.  I was so full by dessert, but it is impossible not to eat it.  You get a lovely cotton candy dish along with other goodies.  Also, they always give you a little gift to take home, so that you can remember your night the next day.  This time I got a brioche that you bake up so that you can experience the aromas again. The other part of this particular evening that was exceptional, was due to the fact that we messed up our reservation.  They did their best to accommodate us, and I was so happy, as we would not have had another chance to come back during our short trip. This place has become \"our\" place, where we go to celebrate or for a romantic evening.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Montréal has amazing food and great restaurants but Europea has to be on the top list due to the amazing service, great tasting food and creative appetizers.  Must try this restaurant."}
{"text":"So we took a Groupon for 2 for lunch.And we had a memorable delicious extravagant and fancy lunch! We had a five-course meal. We paid around 145$ including service and taxes and boy, every bit of it was worth it.  Elliot - Our server was a delightful, kind and impressive person. The kind of service and attention to details were spectacular! The food prep and serving was beautiful.   Reservations: I took the vegetarian/vegan meal and my hubby chose white meat diet. They take these details while you call for booking and then they call you back to reconfirm your reservations.  Food:  They shared the pre-fix menu choices for lunch and for me they mentioned all that they have. and then they started to serve. wow! Not only the presentation of the food was unique but the food as well. We started goat cheese and pesto lollipops & popcorns and a choice of wine, the bottled to be shared between two of us and left over was given to take home. We chose white wine and we got again a delicious French wine (Chartier), which is like 20$ in LCBO and then we were served taro/oregano- truffled cappuccino & shrimp cappuccino(Hubby). The side of bread (we had choices) with 3 kinds of butter, I loved the flower butter. The bread was freshly baked and aromatic.  Now for the mains, I had Quash/cashew Patty along with a fried roll. So yum! so so so yum! It was smoked and garnished with red quinoa. My hubby chose Foi Gras, he got it along with mushroom shaped breads served in a book box, a fried roll and a smoothie(I wish I was served too). the smoothie was beet/green apple and was delicious.   For second mains, I had roots with hummus- delicious, roots were steamed to perfection, to compliment they had served the side of sweet quinoa and salty sauteed mushrooms.Oh so yum! My hubby had some Bass, which was first smoked in the grass and was shown to him for his approval to serve.   Now the dessert: Some berry mouse with sorbet- oh so delicious so perfectly sweetened, along with blueberry cotton candy tree and Meringue to share. Then we got a choice of coffee and tea. they served Nespresso coffee along with Tea cakes (In a to-go box, so that you can take the leftovers).   Well, It's not over yet.  We also received an autograph from the chef, a jar of eggplant caviar, a big Meringue to take home along with tea cakes and wine.   It was a memorable and delicious experience! Loved it! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here last year for Valentine's Day and we had a wonderful experience. It is a very upscale and classy restaurant, but the waiters and staff are incredibly welcoming, accomodating, generous, and courteous. We were blown away by the unique and creative presentations of the various appetizers. They prepared for us a miniature clothesline that had cured beef jerky hanging by mini clothespins. The waiter then presented us with a small box that contained cigar like cheese sticks and a book that opened up with a cloud of smoke, but contained a little surprise inside. We also had the lobster cappuccino and so much more. It was one of our favorite and most memorable dining experiences."}
{"text":"I came to Europea FOUR AND A HALF YEARS AGO (August 2008) and the meal still sticks out in my mind and ranks in my top five best meals, ever. Hubs and I spent a week in Montreal in August 2008, and we wanted a special meal to celebrate my birthday a little early. I cannot recall how we stumbled on Europea, but I am so happy that we did! It was actually on the same street, same block as our hotel, which turned out to be a very good thing since we were so drunk and stuffed after our meal that all we could manage to do was stagger down the street back to our hotel. We had the nine course tasting menu, with wine pairings, and it was stunning. Everything - service, food, presentation - was seamless. Obviously this is going way back, but I think the entire meal set us back approximately $400 USD and it was the best $400 I ever spent! It epitomizes why it is worthwhile to pay for experiences rather than stuff. I'd highly recommend Europea, and the reviews show that the quality has maintained in the almost five years since I was there. This will be a required stop for me the next time I make it to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Having dined at Michelin establishments in Europe, I have to admit that this comes pretty close to deserving at least a star if not more. We were visiting montreal for the weekend and had already made reservations couple of weeks ago. Reservations seem extremely hard to come by at a convenient time, so reserve early to avoid disappointment. As soon as we were seated the food mostly in tapas style started arriving. It was presented in a quirky way especially the prosciutto chips hanging on a clothesline. Some dishes did not hit the mark from a taste perspective but scored high marks on culinary genius and creativity. The initial barrage of tapas left me in a food coma and I was not quite sure how much capacity I had left in me to get to the main part of the meal. They offer 2 different tasting menus and I think it's a great value for the price, we chose the smaller of the 2 tasting menus. We were served by different servers throughout our meal and I only had issues with one of them since they did not handle my cocktail request very well.   Highlights Lobster cream Cappuccino with truffle - How can you not like this combination? I was salivating the minute I saw this dish on the menu.  Goat cheese lollipops with parmesan - Heavenly, need I say more !  Scallops - Delicious crust and the risotto was a perfect pairing with the earthiness of the mushrooms  Ravioli - We cleaned up this plate upto the last tiny morsel!  Disappointments Maple bark stewed pan-seared foie gras, caramelized on a river stone with ice wine - This is a test of patience especially when the end product doesnt meet your expectations. The presentation is fun and you have to wait for the foie gras to cook itself on the hot stone. Unfortunately the temperature of the stone was higher than necessary which had an overall impact on the flavors I could taste. I think their earlier combination with mushrooms looks more appealing to me.  The dessert was presented in a creative way (like a fried egg) but from a flavor perspective it did not pack a sweet punch. If you looking for a fun and adventurous dining experience, look no further than Europea. They change their menu every season, I can't wait to go back in the fall or spring to try out the inventive cuisine."}
{"text":"Probably the most fancy and most definitely extra restaurant I've been to in Montreal. The service here is not like any other fine dining restaurant.   We first heard about this restaurant from friends who came here to try the dessert. The cotton candy tree dessert (called \"passport to something\") is the reason we came; but the amazing appetizers and service was why we stayed.   Right after taking our order, a wonderful array of appetizers was presented to us, each in a unique and memorable way. For example, the tartar was delivered to us in a book filled with smoke, while the cheesesticks were delivered to us as cuban cigars. Each dish was beautifully made and incredibly delicious. Paired with a great wine and cheese selection, Europea soon became one of my favourite places to go to celebrate a special occasion. When my friend left Montreal, she even said that she would come back here one day, just for dinner one more time!"}
{"text":"This is probably the fanciest restaurant in Montreal, and it was worth every penny. This was our splurge meal while we were in the city, so we went for the 10-course tasting menu with wine pairing. Ten courses is a lot, of course, but tasting menus are usually very small, \"tasting\" portions. The portions here at Europea were not always as small as typical tasting portions, but on top of that, you get way more food than the ten courses you pay for. I think they must have served us 4 amuse-bouches before the tasting menu even begun! And the final sweet dessert course was also several different items, more than just one sweet.   And then -- and then! -- they even sent us home with more packaged food! Carrmelized nuts, cookies, a meringue... The whole thing was absolutely bananas.   If you are looking for a special occasion meal in Montreal and are willing to spend the money on it, look no further. If you are looking to spend less, you may still order here a la carte and eat very well. Everything was spectacular. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome experience and the food never ends.  My wife and I had the 12 course chefs tasting menu and we enjoyed it from start to finish.  I cannot stress enough how great the service is, the staff is magnificent.  They do a great job at explaining every course and how to appreciate the culinary experience.  All 12 courses were great my wife and I tried to rate each one and it was impossible they were all #1.  The dessert was great and the presentation was even better.  This is a go to place if in the mood for some fine dining and a great experience."}
{"text":"Outstanding experience.  The flavors and presentations were artistic,  it felt like an evening at a gastronomical theater.  Staff was respectful and attentive."}
{"text":"If you want a true culinary experience I recommend coming here (request to sit downstairs in the chefs area). The food presentation is superb....the dishes are all beautifully prepared and flavorful. The service is impeccable. We ordered the small tasting menu (the restaurant has 2 - there's the big one...the chefs tasting menu...and the there's another one that has 3 courses) which was definitely enough food. I can't even begin to go over each course (though the most memorable came out in a Harry Potter type book with steam), as you'd be reading forever. So in sum, this is fine dining at its finest in Montreal, and is a must try."}
{"text":"Dinner at Europea was a magical experience. I came with a large group of people so we ordered some appetizers to share and each ordered our own entree. Even before our appetizers were brought up, we were brought a series of amuse-bouche, such as cheese lollipops, lobster cappuccinos, smoked salmon, etc. it was fantastic and really engaging to try!  For our appetizers, we ordered the foie gras, deer tartare, and the lobster salad. It was all very good, especially the deer. For my entree, I ordered the scallops and it was plated absolutely beautifully. Some of my companions ordered the lobster and homemade pasta and they also said it was incredible.   The dessert round they brought us was also absolutely wonderful! You cannot go wrong with Europea. It is truly a dining exper"}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed with my meal at Europea. The ratings, reviews and lists of top restaurants all would indicate that our dinner would be an exceptional experience. Unfortunately it was exceptional experience for all the wrong reasons.  Europea may at one point (25 years ago?) have been a good restaurant. But to say that it is out of date would be an understatement of enormous proportions.  The food theatrics accompanying each dish not only do not cover up the mediocre quality of the ingredients and tastes, but also result in a wait staff that is overly harried and unacceptably inattentive. The food itself is poor. The service is weak. The meal was a bad concept poorly executed.  We ordered the tasting with a wine pairing. It might have been a very busy evening - that's not an excuse for waiting 45 minutes to deliver the first glass of wine - which was a glass of champagne we had to request separately (not a part of the pairing) when it was clear no wine was on the way. When the first pairing did appear, it accompanied a dish that was overly complex and simultaneously bland - over produced, over thought, overly creative. I never thought that it was possible to be \"overly creative,\" but now I have experienced Europea.  The space was not clean, and somehow even the dishes and cutlery were dated and lame. We pulled the plug and asked for the check before we arrived at desert, and even had to struggle to get the waitstaff to put us out of our misery. By the time we did get the bill, we were laughing uncontrollably about how awful the entire experience had been.  The meal was expensive. $700 for the two of us. That would be fine for an amazing meal and a great experience. But given the level of execution here, I feel like we were scammed."}
{"text":"I tried their lunch tasting menu, and it was full of delight surprises. The calamari \"pasta\" is my favorite, five stars!   Keep in mind to make the reservation in advance. I tried to reserve the dinner a week before, but all the seats were booked."}
{"text":"Very good food. Very different. French and small portions awesome food. Nice surprises from the chef. Definitely worth checking out. Great service. Nice romantic location and Martinis were on point."}
{"text":"Interesting dining experience, good service, but the food quality only worth 2 stars considering the price.  They served some free starters but they were not fresh at all. The truffle popcorn tasted like it had been stored for hours, not crispy and too much truffle oil on it. The beef jerky tasted no difference than those brought from Costco. The \"surprise bible\" was interesting, but the salmon inside was not fresh.  Surprisingly the butter came with the bread were not fresh! Tasted like it has been stored for a long time! The lobster latte tasted good, but not outstanding. The Veloute soup had a heavy taste.  For main courses we had medium steak but it was not juicy. Another main course, veal in clay, tasted greasy.  Cookies and macaroons in the desert were neither fresh... I was also pretty surprised to see cotton candy on the table is such an upscale restaurant."}
{"text":"An amazing meal and experience. You must eat here!  If you have the time, the tasting menu is well worth it. We had the 12 course menu which took about 3.5 hours for the 5 of us. Wonderful service, exquisite presentation and flavour. A memorable meal.  At the end of the meal, we were even offered a drive home from their valet service!   I very highly recommend this restaurant. One of my top meal experiences."}
{"text":"CAVEAT: We came on high recommendations from our friends who have always gotten great suggestions from so perhaps our anticipations caused some of the let down.  Tried the $99 tasting menu, it was packed full of surprises and creative presentation of food, but while some items stood out as amazing, some were not quite at the standard we would expect at such an establishment.  Overall the dishes were solid and I do appreciate the effort put into the meal, but I really did not expect some of the disappointments from a top-scale fine dining restaurant...  Personal Highlights: *Lobster cream Cappuccino with truffle puree *Tagliatelle of lemony calamari. Poached quail egg, squid ink and garlic butter croutons *Maple bark stewed pan-seared foie gras, caramelized on a river stone with ice wine. Cloudberry cannelé (be prepared, the portion is huge, probably twice the size of what you'd normally expect to see)  *Pina Colada (pineapple puree, coconut foam, rum jelly...so delicious, perhaps the best part of desserts for me)  Disappointments: *The surprise starting treats (truffle popcorn, goat cheese lollipop...etc) were enticing to the eye, but the bits that were suppose to be crispy were all crunchless and a bit soggy. *Wild Sockeye salmon cooked in breakable clay -- the presentation was fun and concept of clay baking was intriguing, but our salmon was way overcooked, which was such a let down! *Cornish hen cooked in hay-lined pot -- Again, loved the concept and presentation, but the hen was way overcooked and dry. The hen broth infused with galangal was delicious though, but it could not save what essentially tasted like bland overcooked chicken breasts...such a shame!  We did the prestige wine pairing, which was nice, but in hindsight, I'm not sure if we might have done better trying other wines.  Pairing the Krug with the fois gras was a lovely touch, but not sure if that justified the $125 price tag if you aren't dazzled by the Krug. Of the 5 wines, the VPZ Catalan, Cuvée \"FERNAND VAQUER\" 1991, was nice enough, but stood out to be more disappointing of the choices, instead of \"smokey nose with notes of fig\" ours reminded me more of a tawny port, perhaps its harder to control quality for these older vintages.  Overall, if you have never been and would like an evening of creative fine dining in Montreal, I recommend still Europea. I would, however, skip the signature tasting and opt for the  $69pp \"Table d'hôte découverte\" (still has a bunch of surprises), and unless you love some Krug, there's no need to go for the \"prestige\" pairing.    Our friends came on different night when the head sommelier, Jack Grimaudo was in the house, they found him to be extremely knowledgeable and engaging.  Unfortunately, we had a different sommelier on our evening and he seemed rather unenthusiastic about describing the pairing choices or in answering any questions."}
{"text":"So I was trying to find a restaurant comparable to Toque.  Someone suggested Europea to me.  I went there by myself.  Got an outside seat.  First, the weather was good, so it was okay.  However the club across the street was blasting dance music all night, which degraded the dining experience.  Then the dishes took at least 20 minutes each, add that to the tasting menu, and we get a 4 1/2 hour dinner.  Yes, they said it was their busiest night, but that's no excuse.   At the end, the cold night air was too much for me, and I had to call it quits early.  Even with like 10 patrons left there, the dishes were taking half an hour each.  The food was so-so. Maybe better than your average restaurant, but nothing to wow about.  Even the full Foie Gras dish I ordered extra wasn't well balanced, with too heavy of the liver taste.  Yes, there was some hype with the thick egg soup, bringing you a whole crock pot showing you a chicken, but you got to taste about a mouthful.  The cotton candy bit (which came too late for me).  The quality of food was there, just not as good as I expected.  The place is tiny, and I am not sure doing up, downstairs and outside is the way to go.  Overall, I regret going to Europea instead of Toque.  Will not do that again."}
{"text":"Perfect. Great experience. Such a tremendous attention to details. And we are talking abut food, not a powerpoint presentation. Was pleasantly surprised by both food, and service. The way they serve it, is simply a performance. But make sure you come in early, when the floor is not that packed, otherwise the waiters won't have enough time to present the food to you. High cuisine / almost Art :). Definitely coming back again next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"This was by far the best meal we have had anywhere, and we have traveled far and wide. Dining at this lovely restaurant was a superb experience from start to finish.  We were attended to by a very professional and caring staff including Samuel, Celeste and Jessica. Each course was presented as a work of art and tasted exquisitely. We had a private niche which add so much to the ambience. The dinner, with all the servings, took 3 hours. It was beautifully paced.  Each course was a party. When in Montreal don't miss this dinner experience."}
{"text":"Took my husband here for his 30th birthday and we ordered the 12-course degustation \"Tasting Menu\". Food was incredible and well presented in an entertaining way (one of the reasons why I booked here as I read reviews of the interesting way the food is presented plus a few surprises). Upon entering the restaurant, we were treated special and given the \"chef's table\" downstairs which overlooks the chef's kitchen. Initially I thought the setup was strange and unromantic (facing the kitchen instead of each other), but it actually ended up being really good and was entertaining to watch the chefs in action! Only comment is perhaps the kitchen could be more aesthetically pleasing/fancier and also I felt a bit cautious as the stairs were directly above me (people walk above you) and was afraid dirt would fall on top of me/my food. Thank you for a great night out in Montreal!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good restaurant, but I disagree with all the raving reviews.  I see the words creative, refined and sofisticated coming from my fellow reviewers.  I disagree.  I had the prix fix menu and I can't say I was impressed with any of the 8 or 9 dishes.  They are all good.  Just good.  I just spent the week eating at places like l'Epicier, Milos and Au Pied du Cuchon and this place just couldn't comparre.  I was bored. The service was not very good at all.  I mean, it wasn't bad, but the attitude was just not right.  If I'm paying $300 for dinner, I don't need a waitress who's snobby.  I was ordering 18 year Yamazaki and every time she brought one out, it was smaller than the last.  I mean, 2 sips maybe.  I've never gone anywhere where they serve such embarrassing drink portions.  Man, raise the price and serve a decent amount.  I didn't want to complain so finally I just said, \"do me a favor, please take this back and tell the bartender to serve me a double because I'm not used to seeing a glass served with such little alcohol.\" This girl tells me, no, drink that and then I'll get you anotherone.  Are you kidding me?  This was just one of the things.  She had an attitude and frankly, I go pay big money to dine at these kinds of restaurants because I want to be treated like a king while I dine like a king.    As for the food, each dish was ok.  I did not think they were imaginative at all.  Like I said, absolutely nothing memorable.  Nothing I haven't had before.  When comparing it to the other restaurants we dined at in Montreal, I would say that this was easily the worst one.  The ambience was nice and the presentation was very good, but it just came up short in the service and food, which is why I go to a place like this in the first place."}
{"text":"We went to Europea expecting to be blown away by an experience similar to that of Per Se or a Michelin star restaurant based upon the reviews here.   This place has pretty good food. The service is excellent. But, unfortunately, I was not blown away by any one dish. The flavors never challenged my palate. There was something about eating here that felt very assembly-line-ish. Every table had the same amuse bouche. Every table was eating the same Lobster Cappuccino. Every table had the same desserts. So while the food was pleasantly presented, it didn't feel like it was served with love. I imagined rows of hundreds of beef jerky apps lined up forever in the kitchen.   Europea puts you through the motions of a fine dining restaurant, but without very much choice or personal aspect to the food. It's a bit like swimming in a pool as a child vs a creek. Sure, the pool is a safe bet. But it's sanitized. The creek has characted and memories. Eating here after eating at the small family restaurant Toroli made me feel sad that this type of experience is what we call fine dining. The meal experience at Europea was clearly designed to appease tourists and wanna-be foodies. I was not impressed by the thin veneer. If I'm going to pay $60 for lunch, I want to be blown away by the food. This simply did not happen. It was a safe experience with little culinary adventure involved. Don't be fooled Yelpers, this is not a 4.5/5 experience."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for our 25th anniversary and I guess my expectations were raised given all the \"wow\" type reviews. Even though I made reservations 3 months in advance, I felt the staff was severely strained with all the running up and down the 2 story restaurant.   This is not a Michelin level restaurant as the service was having difficulty keeping up and often rush our course dishes off the table while we were still nibbling. Specifically, my dislikes (and my wife agreed) were:  1- Harried staff straining to deliver courses and often rushing them away because the next one arrived too soon. The pacing was off by several points.  2. Staff was out of breath running up and down a circular stairway to reach 2nd floor (where we were) 3. Some of the dishes were just too weird including specificaly:   a) Red Risotto (comes with both 6 and 12 course tasting menu as well as separetly). The red comes from cubed beets and over useage of beet juice. Very little actual rice (the base of risotto) and mostly beets with difficult to find shrimp. It was all too sweet and could have used more rice and less beet sugar.  b) The slices of home-made dried beef jerky (which is on display on their website home page) were actually one-third as big as their photo and you only get three (shown on the photo) IF THERE ARE 3 people in your party. With only 2 of us in our party (wife and I) we had 2 scant pieces of dried beef hanging on the pseudo-clothesline which were about as big as my thumbnail. A bit deceptive if you ask me.  c) The menu and website mentions \"The Europea cheese cellar : a wide variety of nearly 100 Québec cheeses to discover\" as one of the courses (we choose the 6 and 12 tasting menu with wife having the 6).  I was \"invited\" to get up and look at their cheese \"cave\" (a table at the back of the room) and select my own cheese. GREAT! I said \"YES\". Next thing that occured was the waiter left and sent me the cheese expert waiter whose job it was to TALK ME OUT OF actually viewing their cheeses! What? First you feature and boast this on your website, Invite me to view your cheese collection (I LOVE CHEESE!) and when I agree to accept your invitation, you send someone over to talk me out of it???  The service experience was odd to say the least. I finally gave in to the cheese visiting fiasco and picked 2 cheeses *(verbally from my table) and what got delivered to us .... again .... just like the dried beef pre-appetizer .. was 2 pieces half the size of a domino rectangle and 1/2 as thick horizontally. It wasn't even worth the hassle I was put through.   d) The 'Braised beef sundae\" was also weird. About one tablespoon of shredded  beef on the bottom with mostly Bernaise sauce (similar to Hollandaise) and foam you are supposed to eat with a spoon like ice cream - yuck. I didn't like that at all. Not the presentation (please give me beef on a plate thank you) or the overwhelming suffocating of the scant shreds of beef with Bernaise sauce.   Between the misleading photos on the website showing larger portions, descriptions of \"100 local Quebec Cheeses\" which you will never get to see  ... and over useage of cigar boxes (used in 3 courses) ... a strained staff that is about to faint from all the running, and optical illusions (large dutch oven lined with hay and citrus for a slice of sea bass that is 1/2 a Canadian $10 bill), and a waiter promising me a new napkin which never came ... this restaurant might be fun to try once. But I'd never go back .  I'm sorry but for $500 for 2 people I expect much, much more in terms of staff, service, honesty in customer service, and presentation. Cotton Candy? Really? This is nouvelle cuisine??"}
{"text":"If I had a chance to put 10 stars I would. Best experience of my life with my husband and kids. The food is art and out of this world. It is delicious and it looks picture perfect. It is one of the places to visit (eat) before you die. Thank you to our waiter and rest of the staff for awesome service and delicious food. We love it and we will definitely come back here if we visit Montréal."}
{"text":"Nothing to say but wonderful, beautiful, delicious experience we have ever had. And I have to say one of my favorite foie gras I have ever had. I may add that the wine selections were simply delectable. We simply cannot wait to return for another anniversary. Tres bien !"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best restaurants in town. This is not your everyday restaurant - but perfect for a special occasion. The tasting menu will take you through an amazing culinary experience. Each service is very well though of and executed, and the service is friendly yet very profesional. It's pricey of course, but you will definitely enjoy something new. A must-try, at least once!  The lunches are also very good - faster to match your agenda, and the prices are beyong reasonable for what you will get. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you, this restaurant is basically like being in a Harry Potter movie. Each dish has some sort of wizardry involved with smoke coming out or some kind of special effect. It was to the point where I ended up video recording the entire dinner. I was definitely blown away by the presentation as they were critical on each detail. It was a dining experience to remember.   I just wished the food tasted as good as it looked. It was very plain and had no flavor at all. There was no creativity as it seems they had put all their attention on the presentation. At the end of the night, I did not remember a single dish I enjoyed.   Be aware that this place is extremely expensive. I curled up in fetal position and cried after I saw the bill. It is one of those restaurants that you can show your friends pictures and videos to make them jealous from how amazing all the food looked. Let's be real though. This is just to compensate that void and pain you are still feeling from swiping your card."}
{"text":"Presentation was really the highlight of this dining experience.  The food was good but some substance was sacrificed for style.  The lobster cappuccino for example was basically a shot of pretty good lobster bisque with the lobster removed and some foam on top.  I felt like I was drinking the sauce (albeit a very good one) meant for a very nice seafood dish of some kind.  I just had a general sense the chef was trying too hard to create new combinations of techniques, flavors, and presentations. If I didn't have other high end dining experiences for reference, I think I would have found the dishes delicious enough, like 4-5 star good. But in actuality, with almost everything I tasted I thought he variation the chef introduced didn't add much to the dish and often detracted from a version of the dish I had somewhere else. I have complained that some high end restaurants are converging on similar recipes and presentation and I applaud Europea for trying to innovate.  But when you try to put a twist on things, you should make sure it is at least as good as the original.   A lobster bisque without the lobster doesn't become magical just because you serve it like a cappuccino.  Smoked salmon served on what looked like fried wonton is tasteless if you don't warn the diner the book is filled with smoke and everything will be tasteless if you accidentally breath in the smoke.   I also often thought we were served the components of a larger dish and/or the dish only had one note and needed something else on the plate.  In addition to the aforementioned lobster bisque (cappuccino), the veal cooked in clay pot was also a little odd. The presentation was good, with the waiter letting my wife break the pot before taking it back to kitchen for plating.  The civet sauce was fine, the potato slices on top were pleasantly crispy, the veal tasted good, if not extraordinarily so.  But the dish has only one flavor note nor variations on texture except for the first bite or two on the potatoes (they got soggy quick and just kind of merged into the meat and sauce).  Cotton candy tree was like meh, whatever.  Meringue at the bottom of the tree was sweeter than usual and a lot sweeter than the ones in plastic bag they give out to go so I am guessing it was a slip on quality control.  The ones from the bags were spot on and I have been snacking on them since my trip to Europea.  Overall, I think the place is adequate for a good date night out (especially if you haven't been to a lot of high end restaurants using modern cooking techniques) but at this price point I expect more than just adequate."}
{"text":"So great. Really worth to have a try. So man surprise."}
{"text":"Except 200-220$ (tip included) for the   Previous Commentary by Christopher M.,  but I must add some notes. First of all the French Toast with Foie Gras and berry with reduces Chicoutai was Extraordinary. I think I'd have that everyday. The Princess scallops with porcini cream was really good: The texture - almost crispy-ish of the scalopp with the creamy taste was a nice blend in mouth .It is some New French Cuisine with some extreme talent. As for the Service, I'm French I know it was relaxed and absolutely professional and since there as no english-speaker client around our table, I must say that I don't know if they might be a language barriage of not.  The Service was fast and you could feel the kitchen staff was drilled and professionnal; The talent was constant. I took the Menu Degustation Signature\" with the accompanying wine pairing (5 glasses of wine) (too)).  Wine were approx. some 20-50$ wine so somehow some decent quality wine.   As for the CO2 ceasar salad, it is presented as an experience therefore I could not agree on the taste. Personally I thought i was special but not in the bad way. Good mixed taste with the Parmeggiano but I would have found the taste a little bit more fun if the porcetta was cut in small bites and pour into the «Salad Mousse».   All the portion were really by the book of French Cuisine standard full 7 courses meal ; approx from 40 to 100g per course (2 to 4 onces) and the main course was 150g (4.5-5 onces). The Cheese course was really well presented and all cheesed were tempered so the flavours were enhanced and tastier. As an ex-cheese-seller I can definately assure you the selection is good.  The presentation and the freshness and taste of desert were incredible.   Again, another point where I would disagree with the previous post is the price which is justifiable because you have some extremly high quality products that are fresh and  as an Ex-Chef I can tell that the cost of the products that are served in your dishes easiely cost 30$- 40$. So basically if you go there and have some training in the food business, trust me, you'll be AMAZED by the technics they're employing for the menu. I think the same Restaurant in New York City would cost approximatively 300-400$ per person. Such products are really hard to find and not foundable in a near area."}
{"text":"No wonder this place is considered one of the best in the northern hemisphere. We had a PHENOMENAL lunch, I believe we will think about it for years to come. We were a group of 30, and we received very special attention, our waiters were marvelous and extremely professional, the food was to die for!!   We had a 4-course meal, but before all the food extravaganza started we had delicious amuse-bouche to open up our appetite. We had very thinly sliced cured meat, we had munched on truffle pop corn (??), and we got a bite of a macaron like thin Parmesan crisps sandwich filled with goat cheese.   We then were presented with a tray full of delicious breads: herbs, baguette and olive roll. I wanted one of each, of course! Haha they were warm and all of them felt straight like out of the bakery's oven! The best part of the bread was the choice of butter we were offered to pair it with. Not kidding! This is the first time I have ever seen this, 3 types of butter, very delicately presented: fluffy sweet rose button butter, elderflower butter, and see weed crusted butter. Omg.   After all that, we were given an espresso cup with a lobster bisque composition that had layers after layers of flavors. It just kept on getting better. Have I said omg?! Small, but just enough. Hmmmmm.  Our second course was a choice of a pea gazpacho with shrimp or a tartar topped with duck bacon. Both dishes were fabulous, full of elegance, with gorgeous decorations, textures and colors.  For our third course, we were given a choice between a beef with potatoes, scallops with a green risotto, or a Cornish hen with asparagus. My descriptions here are giving ZERO justice to the amazingness brought up to us. I got to try the hen and the scallops and it was orgasmic. The hen was so juicy and perfectly flavored, with a thinly crispy skin. Hmmm. The scallops were the best I had ever had. Super fresh, perfectly grilled, delicate under the teeth. Just perfect.  And then we had dessert. But it came with a farandole of sweet treats!!! There was a gorgeous cotton candy tree with meringue pebbles and basketful of fresh (warm) Madeleines. The treats were exquisite!  The actual dessert was made of layers of delicacies: crumbles, blueberries, some sort of whipped cream, gelato and a breakable sugar top.   The meal was exquisite, the service impeccable and the whole thing a true adventure for all the senses!"}
{"text":"Oh my! So we did the 6 courses testing menu, it's about $90 and yes it worth every penny.   Staff was really nice, the food was AMAZING!! I mean I can keep in typing about how delicious my meal was and how my husband thanks me for 100 times that I found this place. Book it and try it. You won't be disappointed. Oh wear loose cloth is a must!!"}
{"text":"My rating will be 3Es :) Excellent food presentation Excellent food quality Excellent service  Went there for my wedding anniversary and wow am I pleased to chose them for the occasion.  Europea offer great variety of fine French cuisine, the presentation is stunning. Let's just say... It's so beautiful that you don't want to eat it lol.  Food quality is amazing, very tasty and they setup the course accordingly to ensure you enjoy every dish to the maximum.  Service: every single dish they put on your table, they will explain what it is, how it's made and how to taste it. They take extra care to details so much they have a wine expert to help us choose the wine to match with the meal.  You will not be disappointed, highly recommended"}
{"text":"I had the tasting menu at Europea in its early years, and I have great memories of it. But Europea is now playing a defending game where nothing changes, and what I had seen as genius and new, now appears as gimmicks and old cheap tricks. If you have been once, you will not need to come back. Great quality, you should go - but it is very disappointing that nothing ever changes. It is time for Jerome Ferrer to rethink his menu and get inspired by more contemporary ideas. His menu and gimmicks now feel a little bit dated. If you are from Montreal and you think this is the pinnacle of food, you need to get out of the city and travel to New York or Tokyo - or at least Google what today's top chefs are doing. Europea is the kind of restaurant that desperately would hope to get one Michelin star, but would lose all of its personality trying to get there by focusing on dated and gimmicky presentation instead of inspired flavors."}
{"text":"More in the blog - highlight dishes mentioned below:  The Why: Jerrome Ferrer is kind of a big deal in and around Montreal -Relais & Chateaux, 4-Diamonds, and the praise of many gourmands follow his name and a place in the Chaine des Rotisseurs particularly caught my attention.  Admittedly a fan of fine dining with an agenda that otherwise included Quebecois staples of poutine, pigs feet, and as much maple syrup as I could find Europea seemed a perfect choice for my one solo night in Montreal - a good reason for the suit and tie as opposed to the Patrick Roy jersey, at the very least.  The Service:  Whether it was my inability to speak French, the fact that I only ordered one glass of wine, or an effect of the fact that there was a large (14 or so) table of regulars seated directly behind me I will simply say that the service at Europea was lacking.  Twenty minute waits between courses, water unfilled for long periods of time, bread service unreplenished, and an inexplicable twenty minute wait at the end of the meal where not a single server walked within fifteen feet of my table (aside from up and down the stairs) to check in, refill coffee, or offer the bill.  I was an island of one in the dead-center of the restaurant for the majority of my visit - something I've never experienced at such a restaurant and hope to never experience again.  It was mentioned to the manager when I asked to see the kitchen at the end of the evening - he blew me off with an \"oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that.\"  The Food:  $100 tasting menu, one $19 glass of ice wine, complementary canapes, amuses, mignardises, bread service, $4.50 coffee.  Calamari - Tagliatelle of Calamari Carbonara:  With many chefs making squid noodles and turning everything into a haute carbonara I'll simply say this dish could have fallen way short for me, but in fact it was probably the best of the night in terms of innovation and execution as the tender squid was nearly indistinguishable from al dente pasta while the use of a poached Quail Egg, squid ink and garlic butter croutons, and lemon 'caviar' all melded into a bright and balanced sauce - I could have eaten a giant bowl of this and left happy.  Foie Gras - Maple:  In a trip filled with fatty fowl liver this was probably the most memorable in terms of 'wow' factor as a thick slice of the lobe arrive previously smoked over maple wood and seared on one side only to be placed on a hot river stone tableside and doused with ice wine allowing it to caramelize under a glass dome as I watched and enjoyed a tasty cloudberry canale meant to 'whet the palate.\"  Smoky and unctuous, sweet with a crystalline crust giving way to supple fat - I'd be hard pressed to name five better foie preparations in the last five years.  Raviole - Fresh organic-herb ravioli stuffed porcini mushrooms:  Never afraid to serve up the bold flavors, this plate was the very essence of the earth and a perfect lead in to the final savory.  Featuring \"Seared Mushrooms picked by Mr Roberts\" including a woodsy cascade of Enoki, Shitake, Morels, Honshimiji, and Trumpets served alongside thin noodles stuffed with truffled Enoki puree the dish was completed with buttery morel mushroom froth with the smell greeting you at 10 feet and the flavor every bit as powerful; this plate also returned to the kitchen without a spot.   The Verdict:  With the previously mentioned service flaws frequently marring the otherwise excellent cuisine and my comments about this blown off by the manager clearly tempering my feelings about a return to Europea I have to admit that on the whole the cuisine was quite goodt and at less than $100 before tax/tip (and converting to the US Dollar) Europea would not be out of place amongst the Michelin 1-Star restaurants of New York, Chicago, or San Francisco.  Certainly a bit of attention to detail would be welcomed, but taking into consideration the ravioli, squid noodles, and foie gras I cannot deny that the meal was a memorable one."}
{"text":"Exceptional foodie experience, very fine dining and original wine pairing. Lots of creativity and almost everything perfectly executed.   Expensive but sooo good! Will definitely go back!!!  (nothing polish at all here!)"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here to celebrate our anniversary. We were referred by the concierge at our hotel and had not heard of the restaurant before. I read the Yelp reviews for some background and can say that they were pretty much all 100% spot on. Here are some observations from our meal;   - Arrived and were seated upstairs in a far back room (behind the naked lady statue :). This is a great quiet room, especially as the restaurant filled up.   - Receiving a note from the chef is a great touch...   - Service was flawless, couldn't have been better.   - My wife ordered a Sea Bass Entree and a I ordered the prix fix menu with Scallops. Both of us had the Calamari appetizer.   - The waiter helped us choose a wine and did a great job.   - The Calamari appetizer was unbelievable, both in taste, but also in preparation. It really *is* linguine, but it is calamari... I'm still amazed.   - The scallops were really good, but so were the lemon.dill, chive potatoes and the caramelized endive.   - I'd suggest passing on expensive after dinner drinks... very few things pair well with cotton candy, certainly not Port. The little sweets that make up \"pre-desert\" were really great..    - My wife ordered a dessert I can only call \"ball of chocolate with ice cream, bananas and hot mango sauce. The server poured the mango over the ball and it dissolved into a plate full of deliciousness... that was an amazing thing to see, really the highlight of an amazing meal."}
{"text":"An excellent fine dining institution in the heart of old Montreal.  Chef Jerome Ferrer's 11 course tasting menu rivals those of many Michelin-starred restaurants, with quality food coupled with flares of ingenuity and just the right amount of ostentation.  Definitely worth a visit. As far as fine dining goes, the tasting menu is a great value."}
{"text":"Wow. Now here is a fantastic place where they seamlessly marry amazing food with beautiful presentation. Then there's the elegant and yet relaxed atmosphere with exemplary customer service. We're from the SF Bay Area and have eaten at numerous amazing restaurants including several times at The French Laundry. We were completely blown away by Europea's food-- they hit especially hard with their teaser the Lobster Cream Cappuccino with Truffle Shavings. To. Die. For. Treat yourself- go here."}
{"text":"I was so glad to find a non-vegetarian restaurant happy to provide a culinary experience for people with various dietary preferences. Too often, if you request a vegan, vegetarian, or otherwise non-standard option, restaurants will do little more than throw something together using that night's available ingredients (you are then stuck eating these improvisations, while the rest of your table enjoys a superior meal for the same price). It is very difficult to come by a meat-free dinner that is well-thought-out, well-executed, and creative, but this is where Europea did not disappoint. My husband and I ordered from both the vegetarian and regular dinner menus, and we were left very impressed. Thank you for a lovely night."}
{"text":"I admit that this was the fanciest most expensive meal thus far of my 30 years. And NO regrets because it was exquisitely delicious!!!  When you order the 6-course meal, you actually will be getting much more than that, since between those courses they give you about 6 other \"treats.\"  The courses with options I would recommend the calamari or foie gras. And I would recommend the veal, Cornish hen and the halibut sea bass which all tender, succulent/moist and flavorful. Really, there's no going wrong in the end.  Oh and there's a lot of dessert at the end of the meal... so prepare for that!"}
{"text":"Inventiveness of the food - Top Notch, Taste of the food - Top-Notch,  Wine List - Top Notch, Service - Top Notch ... Location - Right in the center of Montreal....just off ST Catherine...Price - a great, great deal...well worth the $150 Cdn per person with 6 courses, cheese sampling,  a good bottle of wine and desert."}
{"text":"I and my lovely girlfriend went to Europea for our anniversary. It is a fancy looking restaurant and the decor is elegant. Service is great as well. We ordered the signature tasting menu and a regular tasting menu. All the dishes are well dressed and decorated with beautiful and colorful looking. However, as a high-end restaurant, the taste of their food are definitely not worth the price. I think they spend more time and effort on the emotional experience of the customer instead of the essential element which is the taste of the food. Overall, it is a nice restaurant but over priced. I would go have a great experience with my loved one for once, but definitely not come back again."}
{"text":"It was our first meal in Montreal. We tried the dinner tasting menu. Everything on the menu was great. The lobster cappuccino and the cotton candy tree were best. The whole experience was amazing. Service was good. The courses were introduced interestingly and clearly. They even had some perfume and pastry as gifts."}
{"text":"Élu meilleur restaurant de ma vie   Un grand restaurant aux nombreuses distinctions, notamment membre des Relais & Châteaux et des Grandes Tables du Monde. Haute gastronomie, raffinement et générosité. Le chef cuisinier français Jérôme Ferrer propose un travail engagé et conceptuel, une réflexion sur le goût. Il joue sur la diversité des textures et des reliefs du contenu mais aussi du contenant. Il s'amuse avec les mélanges et les couleurs. Les ingrédients sont habilement mis en scène, pour des assiettes sublimées techniquement bien maîtrisées. Chaque présentation de plat est un événement, un spectacle, un récit, autant ludique que surprenant. L'interaction avec le client est provoquée, sa participation et ses 5 sens sont titillés. Tout a été pensé pour éblouir, faire vibrer et provoquer des émotions.    Mon partenaire de travail qui m'avait recommandé cet établissement, m'avait aussi prévenue du service trop expéditif. Le serveur décrit sans reprendre son souffle chacun des plats et la manière de les déguster, me laissant parfois à la ramasse. Et le desservice/re-service se fait aussitôt la dernière bouchée avalée. Mais pourquoi tant de hâte ? Nous sommes dans un moment de douce flânerie, voyons. De plus, j'ai subi un turnover des serveurs, me privant de tout contact privilégié.   Avec mon conjoint, nous y sommes allés dans le cadre de l'opération MTL à Table et avons bénéficié d'un menu à 69 $ par tête, qui valait largement son prix. Ce qui était annoncé sur la carte était plutôt prometteur, mais la réalité l'a été d'autant plus. Je suis difficile, et il y avait certains aliments énoncés que je n'aime pas, causant en moi quelques appréhensions. Et pourtant, au final, j'ai été transcendée par tout ce que j'ai goûté. Nous sommes ressortis totalement repus et comblés de bonheur. Tant de saveurs et de découvertes, créant une expérience incroyable et mémorable à jamais.  Mon coup de coeur: Tout  Mon astuce: Pour profiter pleinement de l'expérience et rester 4 à 5 heures, visite Europea du dimanche au mercredi et hors période d'événements.

{"text":"It was more than a restaurant it was an experiance. Was in Montreal from NYC for the long weekend and this was a must on my list of places to eat . The outside and decour was average but once the dishes started it was non stop excitement. My fiance and I had the tasting menu and after 3 1/2 hour of what seemed like endless plates we were both stuffed. The wait staff were very great explaining what each dish was being served. The price was a bit high and added higher taxes then i was used to in NY but it is worth a visit at least once"}
{"text":"Best tasting menu I've had so far in Canada. Amazing yet super creative dishes. Staffs are attentive and friendly. Would definitely recommend to foodies in Montreal"}
{"text":"Dear Europea,  Judging from the other Yelp reviews, we are in the minority on this one, but we were immune to your charms.  In the middle of a wonderful stay in Montreal, we were looking forward to dinner with you after an excellent meal at another restaurant in town.  You tried really, really hard to impress. We know. The whole experience seemed designed to surprise and delight with a parade unexpected wonders.   But for us, it quickly collapsed into a humorous show that distracted from enjoyment of the food itself.  Our advice? Less is more. A small handful of the below litany of flourishes, if done well, would have been far more enjoyable.  Here are some specific thoughts on our experience.  AMBIANCE There was a lot going on with the interior, which was broken into many smallish rooms and areas. Each table was cluttered with no less than a glossy stone cairn, a rose in a glass and a candle, in addition to the flashy place settings.  AMUSE-BOUCHES, ETC. - the fanfare of surprise bits of food & fun included: * Two tiny pieces of dried, flavorless meat hanging inexplicably from a toy clothesline. * Truffle popcorn in a black construction paper cone stuck oddly in a bowl of salt along with two goat cheese + crunch somethings in the form of lollipops. * The dramatic hot water on the expanding hand & face towlette capsule presented in a miso soup spoon. * The lobster cream cappuccino was the exception. It was delicious and easily the best part of the meal. It was flavorful, light and rich all at the same time. Wonderful. * A bizarre box in the form of a fake book, filled with smoke and containing a single forgettable salmon h'orderve. * A frozen mist of something intended to clean your palate before the main course. Two bowls of it arrived on a platter which also boasted the enchanting bowl of steaming dry ice! * After dinner, the overexertion continued with the \"pre-dessert\" featuring:         o A metal tree structure festooned with tufts of pink cotton candy and hanging with candy wrapped in cellophane tied to the branches. The base sported macaroons and other things.         o Two chocolate-and-something lollipops fixed to the bottom of a stone bowl with edible glue.         o A Chinese food container (?) with mini-madeleines and gummy treats.         o Cups of custard.         o A giant cellophane-wrapped merengue with a Europea sticker.  Every table was subjected to the exact same stream of gimmicks burped out of the production line, from the postage stamp-size dried meat, to the smoky box, to the cotton candy tree. At one point we smelled the smoke and knew instantly where the other table was in the order of events without even looking - cool! The used smoky boxes sat stacked and sad-looking on a side table. The cotton candy trees waited impatiently next to them in rows, ready to be served.  ENTREE I ordered the Cornish hen prepared in a clay pot. I expected an entire fist-size bird with delicious flavor and nicely browned skin. My Cornish hen arrived at the table sealed in its clay pot on a silver platter. I was then given the \"honor\" of breaking the clay pot with my very own hammer! Silly. They then took the broken pieces back to the kitchen and reemerged with the prepared plate containing two pale pieces (breasts?) of meat on a bed of potato puree, vegetables, etc. The pieces seemed too large for a Cornish hen and the flavor was bland and forgettable.  My dinner partner ordered the red risotto with shrimp and beets. In hindsight, the name of the dish gave us fair warning, but we weren't expecting a bloody red mass on the plate. It was tastier than the Cornish hen but disturbing to have THAT much red glaring at you.  After the red scare and the \"pre-dessert\", we skipped actual dessert and went home disappointed."}
{"text":"Just the best restaurant in Montreal. No contest. No contest!  Order the menu degustation or the table d'hote."}
{"text":"Had a great time at this restaurant. Expensive, but worth it. Definitely dry the tasting menu if you don't mind spending some money."}
{"text":"Best meal ever. Period Got the tasting menu. Subtle tastes using all parts of the palate  Starts with the butter for the bread (was given 4 different ones) and ends with the deserts. Presentations are interesting but conservative and do not overwhelm the food itself. In the case of the smoked rib, it augments it (see photo-thats a glass serving dish with smoke in it, when the waiter takes off the top, you get a wiff of smoke, which starts gets everything going. Service was outstanding also. You will not be disappointed. Make reservations in advance."}
{"text":"I had the chance to try a $45 menu decouverte for lunch with a friend recently and I have to say that I was rather disappointed. I loved the first course, the lobster cappucino was just fantastic, and then it kind of just went downhill from there... I chose the lower river shrimps and pea veloute for my second course. Really, it should only be ordered in the summer. The veloute is cold and the shrimps are tiny. My friend`s beef tartar was ok, but since I am not a fan of beef tartar, I couldn`t take more than a bite of it. For the main course, I had the cornish hen. It was cooked to perfection. The pea mousseline that came with it tasted exactly like what was on the plate of the second course, and since I didn`t enjoy it the first time, I wasn`t too excited to find it on my plate a second time around. My friend`s bass filet was nicely done, although the portion was tiny and I felt really guilty for eating even a bite of it. The desserts were not really memorable, but the final touch with the cotton candy brought on a bit of childhood nostalgia. There was more cotton candy  than we could eat, but it was a fun final touch. The $8 sencha at the end felt like highway robbery. If I had chosen this menu for supper, I would say that it is a decent prix fixe menu, but for lunch, it is a little too extravagant."}
{"text":"God, this is such a great place,  We went there in November as part of the Montreal à table event, where you get to taste specialty restaurants food for a set price. We thought it might not be as good as the real thing since they would likely be full. But Europea Jerome Ferrer's restaurant remains a finest gourmet rendez-vous even when there is a lot of people.  Incredible food, great service, overall fabulous experience, you MUST try it :)"}
{"text":"amazing dining experience from start to finish , the staff courteous , the ambiance cozy , the food was simply amazing   , what a culinary experience , we did the tasting menue , over 16 items , enough to put you're stomach and taste buds into a food coma. ...."}
{"text":"YEA!!!!!!! Yelp has FINALLY come to where I travel most: Montréal!!!!  For about a 2 year span (07-09) I practically LIVED in Montréal! (Hence my lack of reviews for so long! Eh?)  That said: This review is about my experience at Europea, and OH what and experience it is! Chef Jérôme Ferrer was ALWAYS a gracious host. On every visit he would step away from the delights of the kitchen to say a very quick hello. (I think more for my company, George Hanna, Luciano Girlando, Gérald Tremblay, Tom Kostopoulos and a list of others, than myself. I am NOT name dropping, merely refreshing Chef's memory! Oh you better believe he or one of his staff are reading this (these) review(s)!)   On to the experience!  One of the BEST places on has to stop and an \"LSD\" experience with food! I say this NOT as a slight but as a true explanation of what you (will) experience. SENSORY OVERLOAD! The BEST way to explain this is to reference the Disney Pixar movie, Ratatouille! trying to explain the overall experience is like Ratatouille trying to explain to his brother food tastes! Even more difficult is the actual tastes that explode on your palate that render ones mind inoperable for a few moments at every bite! The experience will leave you utterly whirling at your seat.  Anyone who has read any of my reviews will know that I do not GIVE away rave reviews! However, Chef Ferrer can rest assured, whenever I am in Montreal, he will most assuredly see me in either in Europea or the Birks Café par Europea!"}
{"text":"Was the most expensive meal we had while in Montreal.  We went with the smaller tasting menu which was still more than enough food. It was a very visually appealing meal.  For the price and after reading the reviews we expected to be dreaming about this meal and we weren't. Very good and solid meal but for the price we expected more."}
{"text":"i think everyone can recall specific detail of many momentary tastes they had experienced in their first truly exquisite meal. it may not be their favorite meal, or their choice of hypothetical last meal (as this often returns to something your mother made), but it is etched in each person's memory as the moment where they spent more than they ever had before, and walked away with a memory an experience, and a justification as to the value of fine flavor in a world of economic woes.  europea is that first fine meal for me. i and my then boyfriend, and now husband, had spontaneously driven the hours and hours up to canada one year for an international film festival, and as we had been experimenting with several cooking techniques, we decided to splurge, and really try to find out what food cooked by someone with classical french cooking skill tastes like. the person at the hotel desk recommended europea, which was located only a few blocks away. we decided on the tasting menu, with wine pairings, which was a tremendous amount of money in that we had both just started \"grown up\" jobs. but it was completely worth it, and again and again, this restaurant remains my benchmark in an experience of a meal that was completely worth the amount of money we had paid. i can't recall the exact order or items of the menu. but i will tell you that i still recall the taste of the amuse bouche as if it were ten minutes ago. a tiny spoon, and a little espresso cup, filled with the finest, richest taste of lobster cappuchino, or bisque, that you could ever imagine. it sent both of us into a closed eye making of a memory. other dishes that followed included my first taste of foie gras, which was seared and served with a fruit based sauce. of course, the meal continued on with wines, meats, cheeses, and delightful deserts, ending with the finest cup of coffee i've ever closed a meal with. we both left, slightly tipsy, and with the feeling that we would value food as an art for the rest of our lives. each dish cooked once, for one patron, and is different each subsequent time it is cooked due to variations in cooking time or seasons. i felt truly lucky after this meal.  i wish i could recite to you the sequence of dishes, but honestly i wasn't of the initiated at the time that i had eaten here. what i would recommend is that if you're in montreal and in need for a real treat, but have never had an extensive tasting menu before, take the plunge and try this restaurant which will set your standards for you. i truly enjoyed it, and have gone on to taste the creations of the likes of pierre garnaire (paris), david chang (new york), the chefs at les ambassadeurs (paris), my boy ken oringer (boston), etc etc. europea still remains amongst the best and of course my virgin tasting menu. and as a result, fine food is now draining my expenses day after day, but without regret:)"}
{"text":"I'm back after a long hiatus from writing reviews. I've been quite busy over the past few months. My wife and I recently went to Europea to celebrate a special occasion. I consider Jerome Ferrer to be one of the most premier chefs in Montreal. So needless to say that I've really been looking forward to eat there and had high expectations.  We had the tasting menu, and as everybody previously mentioned,the service and presentation were intricate and impeccable, if not somewhat intimidating. Maybe that was the reason as to why I didn`t enjoy my experience as much as I would have wanted. I just never felt comfortable at my table. As for the food, I have to say that none of the dishes particularly struck me taste wise. There were no misses but there were also no dishes that will make me run back to this restaurant. The amuse-bouche and the vast array of desserts were most probably the best part. In all, a good meal but I may have set my expectations way too high. A good restaurant to come to on an expense account. Otherwise, there are other better tasting menus in the city."}
{"text":"We didn't opt for the tasting menu but we're so full from just everything else. Here is the summary of our EPIC meal - amuse bouche: beef jerked, truffle popcorn, goat cheese lollipop, \"cigar\" fried mozzarella stick served on a cigar box, squid ink risotto with truffle (SOOOOO good), lobster \"Cappuccino\" with truffle (BEST lobster soup ever), three fresh butter, salmon with tomato served in a smoked open book, veal in a clay - Quebec veal cheeks slowly braised and cooked in clay with crispy potatoes served with Jerusalem artichokes sauce, royal lobster - lobster with butter, with homemade tagliatelle served with Vermouth cream and lemon zest and fresh truffle and foie gras, and the epic dessert with cotton candy, chocolate Nutella lollipop with pop rocks, orange cake, pancetta and petit four!"}
{"text":"I live in Vancouver and go to Montreal for conference. This is the best restaurant I have ever tried in Canada. The whole dining experience is full of wonderful surprises and the food tastes amazing. The chef definitely put a lot of effort and wisdom to make lots of wow moment. I really want to go again"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this meal with all the awesome reviews.  I visited this restaurant for the last supper of a 3 day weekend trip to Montreal. I was very disappointed.   First, the restaurant has a weird design.  The kitchen is in the basement, seating is available on the 1st and 2nd floor, and the bar is on the 2nd floor. I feel bad for the waiters there.  They had to walk up and down carrying the food and drinks.  We had 2 discovery tasting menus with different selections so we can try everything.  They started us off with a lobster bisque, which was good but would of enjoyed more lobster bits in the \"shot\" of soup. Appetizers, we had the tomatoes with mozarella and crab salad.  The tomatoes were very sweet and served on top of a syrup glazed wafer-like thing, which made it even sweeter! I think I would of enjoyed it more with a savory cracker base instead.  The crab salad had non-existent crab.  Although the presentation was fancy, I was not impressed.  Thank god we ordered an extra appetizer, Bison tartare, which was the only fantastic dish. Entree, we had the mushroom ravioli which was very heavy and served on a big bowl, which made it hard to cut up and eat.  (They were huge pieces of ravioli, not bite-sized.)  Also, had the veal served with some potato puree, not impressed.  They finished the meal off with a bunch of sweets/cookies, icecream lollipop thing, a huge fluff of cotton candy, and more cookies to take home.  Sugar overload!  I think they try really hard to make it creative and fun dining experience.  But for me, I care more about the food over the presentation.  The service was okay, they forgot our tea and coffee (had to remind them) and they did not offer ground pepper for our raviolis.  This was the most expensive meal we had during our trip and it was the most disappointing.  There are plenty of other nice restaurants to go to which will definitely give you a better \"food\" experience. (Toque! was excellent and so was Au Pied de Cochon)"}
{"text":"Amazing Culinary Experience.  We just saw great reviews and only a few blocks from our hotel so walked over and luckily got a seat. We got the meal of our life. 6-10 different small plates just come with dinner. Venison Jerky, Goat cheese lollipops, lemon cucumber Sorbet, smoked salmon, lobster cappuccino, and a wide range of deserts. That was on top of the wonderful Venison tartar and Calamari appitizers we ordered and the Lobster and steak for dinner.   Everything was amazing! Best calamari I have ever had. So tender! Lobster was done perfect. In fact everything was perfect from the ambiance to the service to the food. Yes it costs a little, but it's well worth it.   Go, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time dining here and my fiancé's 1st. We both really enjoyed the meals and the whole experience. We had Martin & François serving us and they're both wonderful and funny. We did the 12-course menu dégustation, which was wonderful and entertaining. Loved all the courses, especially the risotto, lobster cappuccino, calamari tagliatelle and the foie gras. Sooo good! We were so stuffed before the dessert. I enjoyed taking out my rage hammering the clay with the cornish hen in it. The sweets are very sweet, but I like last dessert. The pop rocks in the hazelnut lollipop was a fun surprise. The written note from the Chef at the beginning of the dining experience was a nice thoughtful touch. Merci beaucoup!"}
{"text":"after learning that Montreal has a serious French influence, we wanted to have a taste of real French food there. judging from the high yelp score, we decided on Europea as it happens to be within walking distance from where we stay.   both of us choose the 6 course $95 meal. of the several interesting free appetizers, we liked the cheese with truffle coating the best. We agreed that all the dishes were nicely presented. Here come the negatives: 1. be sure to take a pic of what you get. they somehow managed to forget to serve the lobster bisque to us. after we verify with the table next to us on how theirs were presented, we have to firmly state to our waiter that we never got it. finally, they asked the kitchen to make us the tasty lobster bisque (they call it capuccino).  2. my wife choose the halibut that was highly recommended. it was prepared over a bed of hay? even though the presentation was really unique, we rated the  fish 2/10. halibut that we had before were buttery and moist. somehow this one was way overcooked and not tender at all. never figured out what the hay did for the dish. to be fair, my entree, the veal cheek was much better. it was baked in clay which I was invited to break open with a hammer. the meat was tender and tasty but the potato crust on the veal steals the thunder. it was definitely better than the halibut. to finish the meal, there were many different sweets including several balls of cotton candy. in our opinion, it was a bit much, especially for aged folks like us. overall it is an experience but did not quite fulfill our French cuisine dream."}
{"text":"Let me preface this with my boo thang and I arrived late (around 9:30pm) for our 9pm reservation. As such, our meal was very rushed and the food tasted stale and reheated.   We were rushed to our seats and promptly began our meal with the amuse-bouche appetizers (which was our favorite part of the meal). The beef jerky, truffle popcorn, and cheddar crisps were delicious.   Seconds after, we were served stale, reheated bread with hard butter fresh from the fridge.   Cheddar cigars were then brought to our table, along with risotto balls (also very delicious, but so is anything stuffed with hot cheese).   After the onslaught of finger food, we finally ordered.   The lobster cappuccino was good, but it was more of a lobster bisque in a cup. You couldn't really taste the truffle - wasn't anything particularly extraordinary.   We were then served \"a big book, but a short story\" which was full of maple smoke (surprising and very entertaining) and a small smoked salmon tart.   After, we received our appetizers - calamari noodles with (what seemed like) Alfredo sauce and fish eggs, while my Prince Charming's was scallops with lobster beet ravioli. I preferred my lover's dish, he preferred mine.   We then received a very odd palette cleanser - Yuzu sorbet with cucumber and a very bitter citrusy foam. Not to our liking, the bitterness and chunky texture of minced cucumber with the sorbet was off-putting.  The entrees were pretty good, but again - nothing too extraordinary. My honey-boo-boo noted that it was nothing he couldn't discern from his own cooking.   The pre-desert was overwhelming and contained a plethora of sweets - from cotton candy to macarons and white chocolate madeleines. Then we received the actual desert, at which point I had already contracted diabetes. It was a raspberry sorbet on top of a fresh cream on top of a blueberry cobbler (for the love of God, do not mix this together). My boyfriend and I felt like toddlers on a sugar-high before nap-time - slightly nauseous and not likely to sleep anytime soon.  Overall the meal was good, but nothing as amazing as the presentation of the food would lead you to believe. Atmosphere of the restaurant was slightly confusing as it was a French/Japanese fusion (the change back and forth between upbeat French cafe tunes and zen garden music was a journey in itself).  Good, but not good enough to come back. I think this is largely to do with our running late and the restaurant attempting to close on time - our dining experience was slighted as a result."}
