{"text":"I ordered pizza from here on a Tuesday night for delivery, the time for delivery was said to be 45 minutes to an hour. About an hour and thirty minutes later, I'm still waiting on a pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered a Pizza with Chicken and Mushrooms. It came with tomatoes on it. The woman was rude and refused to do anything when we called. I drove down there to return it and they still would not refund me."}
{"text":"Yes delivery can be a little slow but it's worth the wait for the pizza. Sauce is delicious but most importantly the crust is great for those thick crust lovers"}
{"text":"Was hoping this could be a new go to easy order for us ..... Unfortunately the delivery was painfully slow - almost an hour and a half and then the quality was maybe a 2 out of 10.  Nice guys taking the order and delivering - but just not gonna give it another chance."}
{"text":"So I called awhile back with a complaint... I asked to speak to the owner, I said my bacon was rubbery and seemed undercooked. He claimed it was precooked before baking it on the pizza. I got no apology and haven't went there again. I wish I still had the pictures. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Consistently disappointing. Delivery and pick up is always way longer than what they tell you it's going to be. The wings and breadsticks are ALWAYS boxed carelessly. Butter/sauce on the outside of the container, and sides of sauce are usually never closed. I won't be calling here again, and I certainly don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Quality and delicious pizza!! Very good service, very close to my house. I love this place!!! Definitely I will recommend to my friends!!! I love there veggie  lovers pizza"}
{"text":"We came here before a concert recently and had a great Hawaiian Pizza. Their fish sandwich was very good also. The people that work here are fun and friendly. I recommend if you're in the area. Walk straight down the Library's (music hall) steps, through the park and keep going. It's in a strip mall near the Wendy's."}
{"text":"The pizza here is GREAT and it's one of the best I've eaten on this side of town. It's the type of pizza you crave. When I come to Pittsburgh to visit, I have to come here to get my pizza. I haven't eaten pizza this bomb diggity since I visited Phoenix some months ago. I'm serious, the pizza here is good and if you don't want a whole pie, you can get single slices. The customer service isn't bad either."}
{"text":"With almost 2 hours to burn prior to the Yngwie Malmsteen concert at the nearby Library Music Hall and wanting to avoid getting gouged by their weak snack bar ($3 for a bag of chips???), we strolled through the venue's adjacent park and towards a shopping plaza, intending on hitting up the Redhead until Mama Pepino's stole our gaze. 

Their Hawaiian Pizza was just what Kay needed to kill her pang-plagued stomach. The bacon, ham, and pineapple were generous as was (perhaps too much so) the deeply savory sauce which came off like a hearty tomato soup. 

The crust was truly the pie's best quality, however. Imagine the perfect balance between crispness and chew, and let Mama have her way...with you. 

Also rock-solidly good was my half Italian Hoagie, one that succeeded with both a quality bread that was baked through yet not so much that it lost its plushness and a very ample helping of meats in addition to the requisite fresh vegetables and dressing. 

The staff was a hoot. They put up with us famously and joked with us when I came back from Wendy's (MP's doesn't have a public bathroom) with a Frosty for Kay. 

Afterwards, we took in a symphony...
