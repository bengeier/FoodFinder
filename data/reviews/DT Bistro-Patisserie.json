{"text":"Props to DT Bistro!  We were looking for a dessert place to have a tasty treat after a nice meal.  I yelped this place, and we made our way over.  Unfortunately we got there right as they were closing.  The waitress there at the moment kindly told us they might be closing, but asked us if we would like to order something take-out.    My friend was hoping to sit and have a nice treat, so she was so wonderful and told us not to worry and have a seat and she'd get us some desserts.  To the kind waitress who helped us, you rocked!  I would come back just because you went the extra mile to help us out.  Even your suggestions on the pastry to try was dead-on!  I had the Chocolate Pecan Tart, and it was awesome!!!  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my Mum's funeral. It was held at St. Clement's Anglican Church in Toronto. We were unsure of who to ask to cater. The reception was at 3 o'clock.   Metro provided wonderful fresh fruit trays.   D T Bistro, PERFECT SWEETS . . . outstanding. Each pats try was small, as we had asked for. Fresh taste exploded with every one ( our favorites ? Chocolate tarte & peach soufflé .)  Fifty guests finished every last one !  We feel this Patisserie  is a \" must  try, \" for your next function.  Thank you.  Coline Bettson 647.974.9490"}
{"text":"After a slightly rocky start where we waited 20min for a table and service that was somewhat overwhelmed by the volume - we like this place!  A little rough around the edges still but the quality food and attention to detail is there to see.  The decor is distinctive - french with the touch of vietnamese. Some decent pieces of art and beautiful ceiling light feature.  The savouries are very rich, in a french style, but not over the top. The pork cheek sandwich was perfect in portion for leaving enough space to try the desserts. My wife had the mushroom papadelle, fresh pasta cooked just right,  had heaps of different mushrooms but quite buttery and creamy.  The passionfruit parfait was amazing. My favourite pastry is the passionfruit tart at Laurent in Australia and this is the closest thing I've found to it in North America. The strudel my wife had was average and I wouldn't order it again. The baking paper was left stuck on its base but they redeemed themselves by giving this to us free of charge.  Would definitely come again to try some of the other things on the menu. Toronto needs more places like this with decent pastries.  There were also some impressive photos of some amazing looking wedding and show cakes!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and didn't have a bad experience either time.  Reading these \"unprofessional\" reviews you have to sort out the naivete from the foodies.  (eg: the girl who was upset that they have different rooms for dessert and dinner...have you ever been to Paris???) Both times I went for brunch and I was WOW'd.  GREAT service, GREAT food, GREAT drinks. I plan on going for dinner and will get a better idea of their evening atmosphere. But if you are looking for a good place for brunch in the Annex, give this place a try.  It is well worth it."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic birthday dinner at the DT Bistro over the weekend. I had crab cakes, duck confit and tiramisu, and all the courses were delicious, and the ambience was just lovely. Will return, for sure!"}
{"text":"We just got back from Sunday Brunch at DT's and it was wonderful. My companion had the bacon tart [$16.50] - delicious flaky pastry shell filled with bacon, onion and leek, topped with two medium-poached eggs.  It was accompanied by a small salad of greens and pomegranate seeds, a tomato and two small potatoes.  The presentation was very appetizing. I had the seasonal special, pumpkin salad [$10.00].   Roasted chunks of pumpkin and pear came with very very thin 'crackers' of cheese, pumpkin seeds, cranberry and sesame seeds [I think].  I am not describing these well, but seriously, they were awesome! Underneath it all were mixed greens, pomegranate seeds, slivers of onion and julienned carrots tossed with a tangy but light dressing. Each mouthful offered a different texture and taste, highly appealing. We had coffee [$2.50] and in spite of being quite full we decided to share biscotti to end our meal.  We split a white chocolate almond and then a double chocolate, [5 in a bag, $6.50, which means we can have more biscotti later this evening.  Well, maybe tomorrow.]  The biscotti were not rock hard; rather they were substantial without fighting back.  And did I mention really really tasty? The service was excellent.  There was obvious attention to detail and we were treated well, made to feel comfortable and taken care of.  Coffees were refilled, a new carafe of water materialized exactly when needed, and the bill arrived after we had obviously finished everything we could. It was a delicious and relaxing way to spend a rainy December afternoon. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went to DT Bistro for brunch with a friend who lives in the Annex. Between sitting by the open windows, the flowers & small candles on the tables gave the place a sweet, unrushed ambiance.  Our meals were fresh & tasty, coffee (check!) & we shared some gelato for dessert despite the array of luring desserts behind the glass display. Service was average."}
{"text":"In a serene and Cape-Cod like environment, enjoy a fresh take on breakfast in the Annex.  The delicate omelet with oyster mushrooms and parmesan is divine, as is the dill-scrambled eggs with smoked salmon. The coffee's alright, but the side salad with a crushed almond dressing is fantastic.   A wonderful place to go for breakfast or lunch when in the neighborhood.   Oh and there are the desserts....."}
{"text":"Just dropped by here by chance on my way home after filling myself with quite a meal, therefore we decided on picking just some dessert. A quiet Saturday evening, there was just few tables being occupied, the main room was low-lit, cosy with a gorgeous chandelier and beautiful paintings on the wall. We sat beside the windows right next to colourful flower planted. I must say it would be perfect for a date with all that romance: soft music, lovely flower on the table, small candle brought to our table when It started getting dark outside.    The desserts all looked amazing and their taste even better. I vouch for the pretty flour less chocolate which quite like lava cake served on a dressy plate, complemented with whipped cream, passion sauce really enhancing the taste. My friend had passion fruit parfait light and airy frozen mousses in a small white chocolate cup. The drink menu quite diverse ranging from wine, cocktails, lassie to general drinks, we ordered cappuccino and a pot of blood orange tea. The server constant served tea and asked to fill up with hot water. We stayed there quite a while and service was really lovely and attentive. We had a great time relaxing with tea and desserts, I will definitely come back to try dinner next time."}
{"text":"I think the level of bad service at DT Bistro deserves 5 fantastically red glowing stars. I mean, I have never ever experienced such atrocious behavior at the hands of servers before and truly it must take the best to be this bad.  Dont YOU think 5 stars are required when a server seats you and completely forgets about you for 20 minutes? Or how about when they finally pay attention to you (after you go looking all over the restaurant for them) and smartly retort \"oh well I forgot all about you didnt I\".  Ummm yeah hipstergirlincutoffjeanshorts, you did. Its nothing to be proud of.    Moving on, you patiently await the arrival of your cappuccino. But no, hipstergirlincutoffjeanshorts has something else planned for you: she's going to spill your cup of java and she's not going to be merciful about it. So there you go, the entire wall and the entire table and your entire leg covered in burning hot milk.  My server smiled her evil smile, said \"oops\" and walked off. Bravo.  If the above does not deserve 5 stars, i dont know what does!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here on two separate occasions for brunch and for afternoon tea. It's run by a Viet family and they do a French-Asian fusion. Decor is beautiful and tasteful, great location. The service is noticeably awkward and forgetful.   It is first and foremost a patisserie, supposedly specializing in pastries and cakes--they do wedding cakes. So to my dismay, their pastries for our afternoon tea was most disappointing--no flair, nothing special. On the other hand, their savoury sandwiches were delicious and pretty big with interesting and palatable combinations of ingredients (pear and brie, and braised beef (wow!)). Their tea was good too, standard but rounded selection. I would recommend afternoon tea ($30/pp) if they cleaned up their dessert portion.   The brunch menu was a little overwhelming since they provide you your standard brunch options as well as showcase their fusion plates and I highly recommend trying these. The duck confit was superb, as was the soft shell crab on brioche. Their cocktail offering is pathetic, however. I had to ask for an extra shot for my mojito (my partner pointed out that I kept turning my glass as if to tap into an alcohol reservoir), so their drinks are weak.   Despite my mixed review, I do intend to return (with my own flask) to try their French onion soup, mushroom soup, the short rib noodle soup and the veal cheek curry. And I would still recommend this bistro strictly for its food."}
{"text":"I walked by a few times this place and it looked so chic that I decided to bring my friend here for her birthday.       We came on a hot day so the windows were closed (meh).  The server was pleasant and professional, but the food was bleh. Slightly overpriced, my sandwich was too greasy and the pears seemed to be steeped in vinegar and had a weird texture to them. Even if the pears were done right, it should be a wintery food, did not go well in the summer. I did not enjoy it at all.     My friend enjoyed her crab quiche, though they didn't have her first choice.     I'd come back for desert in the evening - it has a beautiful vibe - but only in the evening and with the windows open :)"}
{"text":"So... let's start out with what I actually liked. My boyfriend's Potato Pancake with Smoked Salmon - with sour cream and a side salad ($16) was quite tasty. When it was served, I was a bit disappointed since I was expecting a crispy latke-like potato pancake. However, I actually really enjoyed the chewy texture of it and it was seasoned quite nicely.  Now, for the bad. My Chorizo and Egg Skillet - baked with potatoes, chorizo sausage, bell peppers with a side salad ($16) wasn't very impressive. It would've been better if the eggs were still runny. Instead, they had a very plastic-like exterior. I'm not sure if this is what eggs are like when they've been baked, but it wasn't appetizing at all. Everything else was just... underwhelming. And the most disappointing part? Spending $16 on that...  I should've learned my lesson, but I was tempted by these chocolate and espresso cookies they had in the display case as we were leaving. I asked for one, thinking it couldn't cost more than a couple bucks. The cashier rang it in, and it cost me $5.09! For a cookie! Which wasn't that great, by the way. Really should've asked for the price first. But like my mom always says - if you have to ask, you can't afford it."}
{"text":"We went to DT Bistro today for afternoon tea for my birthday with my husband and 5 month old daughter. The staff were wonderful and accomodating even though we were being very awkward as we wanted to keep our stroller beside the table and we also added 3 more guests and another baby last minute. The afternoon tea was lovely. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"We just came back from the restaurant, and we didn't like it. the food was not that good the dessert (apple strudel) did not taste good! the waitresses didn't understand us most of the time and the music around was not pleasant.  not recommendable."}
{"text":"The food here is okay but not worth it. Most of it is fairly bland, and considering that it's over-priced. The deserts are 7.5$/8$ each and should be more like 3-4$. The baked goods at Loblaws are a significant step up. My main cost about $18 and was mediocre at best.  The seats here are also very uncomfortable.  It's a cute restaurant, and the staff were pretty good, but if you're going to spend 44$ on a meal you should go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Best croque madam in town but service wasn't great."}
{"text":"We were not impressed with the service and the desserts were disappointing (for the price). We arrived around 9:45pm on a Friday evening during the summer to a restaurant that was less than half full (they close at 11pm). We waited a couple of minutes before I was able to grab the attention of an unfriendly heavy-set waitress. She told us to wait, which was about 10 minutes before we were seated.  Soon after, a boisterous group of about 6 sat next to us. They had asked our waitress to take some pictures for them. Without asking, the waitress proceeded to lean over our table to take several pictures, all while we were eating our desserts."}
{"text":"Looking for a place for some afternoon tea to catch up with my girl friends, I stumbled across DT bistro as we are sick of going to all the hotels for proper afternoon tea. The interior is very bright and elegant, we decided to get the full tea set with those three-tier plates. The mushroom soup was really good and the tea set is really filling by the end of it."}
{"text":"This place is charming!  Reminds me a lot of the little cafes in Paris.   Great atmosphere and delicious dessert. Recommend the flourless chocolate cake -it'll melt in your mouth"}
{"text":"These desserts where so bad that I we threw them out in the garbage. The desserts look good, but man, they're just bad. I had two different desserts, both went in the garbage. Me and m husband felt the same. And the two desserts cost $16  This was a complete waste of money. I threw away cake! Who throws away cake?! That's how bad this place was."}
{"text":"amazing staff and food very girl very lolz i love the place"}
{"text":"DT Bistro used to be our go-to.  The food was always great tasting, portions were large and price was awesome.  Service was to our expectations; nothing to complain about.  The space was ok, but we had always heard from the owner and head chef that renovations were in the plans as the space was inefficient.  When renovations finally took place, hubby and I were anxiously waiting for them to re-open as we needed our fix.  We went the other night after realizing that they had re-opened.  We were anticipating some changes to the menu, especially prices.  To our surprise, the menu and prices did not have too much of a change (an additional $1 for their prix fixe menu, now $26, and they look some items off the prix fixe menu).  The space was nicely done, although I was disappointed that you can no longer see the display of their homemade gelato (I liked walking up there pre-reno. to look and choose my gelato flavours for dessert!).  The food was just as good as we remembered it to be; however, the service was atrocious.  It wasn't as if our server was rude, but she was not attentive at all.  She did the bare minimum and was slow.  It seemed as though she was only responsible for our table (a table of 2) and one in front of us (a table of 4).  I saw her approach the table in front of us several times, maybe she forgot items or maybe the guests wanted more.  But not once did she look up or come over to our table to take our dessert choices.  We asked another server and he responded that we should wait for our server.  We continued to wait ( and tried to get the attention of our server) until we couldn't wait any longer and asked the same server again in a more stern tone and he still wouldn't take our order, but instead, tried to get our server.  She arrived and asked what we would like.  We replied that we would like to order our dessert.  She was ready to take our order, but I had to ask her, what the dessert choices were and what were the flavours of the gelato.  She listed them out from her head, but was hesitant and seemed unsure.  Instead of checking or perhaps bringing us the dessert menu, she stood there, expecting us to choose one of the items she had just listed.  We made our choice and also ordered 1 coffee.  The desserts and coffee came.  I guess my husband was thirsty for coffee as he finished his cup even before we finished eating the dessert.  We were hoping that our server (or any server, at this point) to come by and offer some more coffee.  This did not happen.  We waited another long period for our server to come by our table so that we could just ask for the bill.  And another long time was waited for her to bring the credit card terminal over.  We finally completed our transaction and walked out the door.    It is unfortunate that one of our favourite restaurants have actually put doubt in our minds and have made us consider not to go back again."}
{"text":"We were here for a late lunch, and the food and the atmosphere are fantastic.  We had gazpacho followed by the crab cake sandwich and seafood linguini with two glasses of wine, coffee and dessert.  The bill was around $85.  When we walked in at around 4pm, there was only one waitress, who looked quite overwhelmed with work.  She was very friendly, but had to run around a lot - good thing we were not in a hurry.  At around 5pm the situation improved as more waiters came in.  Otherwise, this was a totally enjoyable experience.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Love love this place... last week i was in the City... hopping from one restaurant to another... started at Blowfish, then Spice Route... but i couldn't find a desert that i like... i looked at my watch... and it was around 1015pm... i headed to this place... Just Desserts... i arrived around 1030pm... they were already closing, but they couldn't resist me! they knew i have to have something sweet! they were so nice, served me the amazing Dessert and also some latte! i love you guys, you made my evening!"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed the fix prix $25 dinner.  Delicious food, beautifully presented, fantastic value. Shrimp bruchetta and 5 spice ribs to die for. Desserts rich but not too sweet.  You will pay double for this sort of food at a well known high end restaurant."}
{"text":"Dear Berry Box,  The first time I laid eyes on you, I knew I had to have you.  When you reached the table, it was hard not to immediately devour you. I had to resist and show some constraint (I am a lady after all)! The berries on top were not only deliciously sweet, but abundant. Your drape of white chocolate had a hint of milk chocolate. But the most surprising aspect? When i disrobed you, I found a bed of creamy chocolate mousse! TO_DIE_FOR! Needless to say, I did not want to share you, but felt if I didn't extend the offer, I would be one selfish biitch.  Please don't haunt me by telling me your calorie count, some things are better left unsaid...  Love, Dreamsrey"}
{"text":"We came at 10pm to get some desserts on my birthday. It's supposed to close at 11pm but we were told it's closing in 30 minutes.  We ordered each of the following:  Mango Parfait Passion Fruit Parfait Hazelnut chocolate cake Mango cheesecake  All of the desserts looked awesome on the display. We were impressed by it. They all look so delicious. When the server brought the desserts to our table, we were visually shell shocked by the disappointing presentation. The dessert is beautifully made but it was totally destructed by the horribly noisy plate. In my untrained eyes, it killed my appetite for dessert right away. You know... A simple white dish would have sufficed to bring out the beauty of the dessert. The sauce and whip scream were also haphazardly put on the plate.  They look so out of place with the beautifully crafted dessert.  The taste of the dessert is ok. The parfaits are a bit too sweet and the cheesecake is too dense. If I want a New York style cheese cake, I wouldn't come to a French restaurant. The hazelnut cake tastes ok but my friends said it's just like Nutella. Nothing special. Overall I think the taste is just ok.  When you come to a French restaurant for a dessert, a good cup of coffee or tea is expected. I ordered a cup of cappuccino because there is no French press on the menu. What came to my table is not a cappuccino. I think it's worse than Tim Horton. No milk froth. It's like a water down cheap coffee with teeny tiny bit of froth. Who in the world makes a cup of cappuccino in a small expresso cup!!!!???  Finally the totally bill is about $50 for 4 pieces of dessert, one lousy cappuccino and one cup of tea. It's way way way too expensive for what it is. No wonder they were closing early. The owner told the servers to close the shop early because business was slow that night."}
{"text":"Great vibe, good assortment, I've had about 5 of the items, all good.  I've talked with the owner once, nice guy, seems to really have a passion for what he does.  Parts of the dining area are pretty narrow so the tables are close together."}
{"text":"Came here for afternoon tea. Worrisome when savoury goods tasted much better than the sweets. It was not worth the $30 per head. The place can get pretty noisy when it's packed."}
{"text":"So I'm typically a fan of this place, but in all honesty, their service is what's really dragging them down to a 3 star rating. Every time I walk in here, there is no greeting or anything, and customers are kind of just left there looking around confused trying to figure out whether or not they are meant to seat themselves.  Given, they are relatively short-staffed for a busy Thursday lunch hour. The place is bustling and busy, and with only 2 friendly servers (and apparently only 1 chef) people are bound to be a little neglected.  My first time here for lunch after coming here for brunch and dinner a number of times, I went for the calamari salad while my friend had the mushroom sandwich. After waiting almost an hour, food arrives (what can I say? Our expectations for slow-service here prepared us). For a calamari salad as an entree, this thing was puny. Like - a side salad with calamari plopped on top. However, as small and unsatisfying as it was, it sure was tasty. The olive encrusted bread that came on the side was delicious.  My friend's plate came with a wonderfully toasted mushroom sandwich and side salad that seemed far more filling, and she savoured every bit of it. WIth a window-side table and the sunshine filtering in, it makes for a great people-watching on a lazy afternoon.   The upside about the teensy salad was that it left room for dessert, which is where they really shine. Deliciously light miniature cakes and a range of gelato flavours that are juuuuuuust right, and a really lovely atmosphere, are what keep me coming back.   If only they could whip their service into shape!"}
{"text":"Brunch is amazing, original and beautiful presentation. I also love that you 'have' to just try a dessert because they look soooo amazing - they taste even better.... I often stop by to pick up desserts for dinner parties or just a treat for my hubby & I."}
{"text":"My favourite brunch place in Toronto!   Beautiful Decor, friendly stuff and great food!  Whole atmosphere is absolutely gorgeous  and their food and deserts are great!"}
{"text":"I actually went here in September for brunch.  I got the French Toast, which was pretty fantastic.  It was very sweet, just the way I like it.  The strawberries were really good too.   For dessert I got the chocolate cake which was just kinda \"meh\" in my opinion. I mean, anything chocolate has to be good, but I've had some pretty amazing flourless chocolate cakes before and this one just didn't compare. The bigger issue I had with this place was the abundance of bees flying around.  I am absolutely TERRIFIED of any kind of bee/hornet/wasp and I swear this restaurant was like their nesting place.  They flew in through the windows and were hovering around all of our food.  One even landed in some honey and got stuck.  One also went into my drink.  For this reason alone I don't think I can return in the summer.  Just a warning to all my fellow bee-haters out there."}
{"text":"Walked by here after dinner on Harbord St and was instantly attracted to the gorgeous interior and ambiance. It's decorated with the most beautiful chandeliers which reminded me of peach trees :P Before getting seated, you can choose your desert from a glass display case. We shared a lemon tart and tiramisu which tasted pretty standard. It's a super cute place to stop by and I might go back for some afternoon tea!"}
{"text":"The chef is European culinary school trained, with a gastronomic family history. this is reflected in the heavily french influenced dishes.   if you familiarize with the restaurant, the service is as good as it gets and they have custom ordered banquets, gatherings, and catered services. just let the chef know what you like.   on their regular menu, i recommend the french onion soup which has the right flavor and isn't loaded with salt. their roast mushroom phyllo tart is another favorite, with rich melted goat cheese.   dieters be warned: the \"richness\" aforementioned does mean a grease fest. \"lighter\" options for waist-watchers include their daily special fishes - just request for it to be pan-seared or whatever the heck you want.  another favorite is their seafood linguine - the sauce allures customers three tables away.  speaking of tables, the place is a bit cramped; given its popularity do make sure to book in advance.  and now the desserts - you can basically pick anything and won't be disappointed. my favorites are the lemon creme brulee and homemade gelato. they have exotic flavors like passion fruit and guava, and for the indulgent i strongly recommend the madagascar vanilla, cafe latte and chocolate."}
{"text":"I was amazed by the poor customer service that I encountered when I attempted to arrange an appointment for a wedding cake tasting.  I contacted Dessert Trends in August 2011, but was told that I would have to wait until mid-October to have the tasting because they were \"too busy\" to meet with me during wedding season.  So I set up a tentative date in October and we agreed to confirm the appointment a week before-hand.  A week prior to the appointment I had not received the confirmation email.  So I waited for a few more days and contacted them to confirm the date and time.    The day before the appointment I was told that everything was arranged for the cake tasting and that I should call Chef Don the following morning.  I was given Chef Don's cell number which I promptly called in the morning.  The phone was off and I left one or two messages, however no one called me back and no one followed up via email to explain what happened.    Needless to say, if Chef Don and his staff cannot even keep a simple appointment for a cake testing (and do not return phone calls), I certainly would not trust them with being able to handle baking and delivering my wedding.  It was definitely a very disappointing experience because they had been highly recommended to us."}
{"text":"Worse businesses ever. Don't do any catering here. They messed up my order trying to tell lies all the time. On my son birthday they promised to have the cake ready and we only found out on our way to pick up, the cake was not available. They didn't even try to let us know a day ahead so we couldn't make time to buy another one on time. The owner said I don't have to make a big deal????, just a cake, they have good cake so I should try different ones instead. He doesn't respect the fact that people want certain things on such big day for our little one. Total jerk. We don't care how good you are, but if you are so vain and conduct such bad service with bad attitudes you only lose business and faith in people. Never again."}
{"text":"I've been to DT for their brunch and I really enjoyed it. Last week I decide to try their dinner menu. I was quite disappointed with my rack of lamb. I ordered medium rare and it was served medium well. The meat was hard and I just couldn't eat it. For the prefix menu, you can only choose from 3 of the dessert where I remember I could choose from all of them years ago when I had dinner last time."}
{"text":"Absolutely must return to try everything else on their brunch menu. We ordered the tuna nicoise which turned out to be a mango salad with seared tuna (read about this in another review and I agree that this should be explained ahead), bistro french toast, savoury lemon shrimp crepe, French onion soup and bistro eggs Benedict. Everything was plate-licking worthy but the winner was definitely the French onion soup. I was not a fan of their lavender passion fruit mimosa but that just leaves more room for their yummy Caesar."}
{"text":"It s really delicious, BUT it is too slow..it s dinner. We spent 1 and half an hour to wait for the starter coming.. Although the food is good, such a long time already depreciate the whole value."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*  My review is a little skewed as I came here for a private party. On that note, if you did want to host a party, DT Bistro has a great upstairs space that can fit around 20-25 people and there is a little kitchenette for drinks, teas, and coffees. It's quaint, cozy, and intimate.  When I first walked in, there was no one to greet me, despite a sign saying \"Wait to be Seated.\" If I hadn't taken matters into my own hand, I don't know how long I would have waited; I had to go searching for someone to ask where was the party (I actually walked in the kitchen and it seemed like I was interrupting some heated convo). I was led upstairs and things changed for the better. I was asked what I wanted and I ordered a tea. Due to the size of the party, the brunch menu was trimmed down (so that the kitchen could cook our orders faster), but what I can tell you is that the portions are HUGE! I ordered a salad as an appetizer and then the Salmon with potato cakes as a main and each dish was sizeable. In other words, the salads can be main course and the main, although delish delish, was filling. I didn't have to eat the rest of the day so good spend of dollars.  The hostess of the event also ordered \"afternoon tea\" scones and jams for everyone which were really yummy. Again, I already filled myself up on those pastries.   Service was really accommodating for our big group. The waitresses attending to our group always had a smile and whatever we wanted, they got. For every dish and drink, they had to go downstairs than back upstairs to bring our food so the job was no lightweight. Despite all that, service was still great.  The bathroom is all the way downstairs (basement level) and when I ventured down, I didn't see any staff so not sure how service is for a regular dine-in experience.  Naturally, desserts here are famous but because I was so stuffed, I couldn't try anything! When you walk in, and to your right, you can see all the artsy cakes on display. I was half tempted to order some cakes home, but alas, there was no one manning that station.  Definitely a local jaunt."}
{"text":"I had DT* for the first time after a long weekend of drinking. (Medical joke intended.)  With a rotating menu of seasonal brunch and lunch options, I appreciate the work the chef puts into his creations.  I had a tower of lemon-dill scrambled eggs served above, below and between two slices of brioche toast and the mountain was topped with luscious smoked salmon.  Luscious!  The sweet brunch items seem to be served in smaller quantities than the 'salty' items such as the egg, quiche, and omelet options.   _______________________________________ *DT = Delirium tremons- the shakes an alcoholic gets after not having a drink for a while.  **Nod to Susan C for the footnote option. This may be the only time I will ever do this!"}
{"text":"This was an unplanned stop as was visiting a nearby store. Having missed out on the previous attempt to try this spot decided to give it a try. The space is nice and will do well just based on that and the location. Most people were having brunch but we stuck to desserts.  I ordered the passion fruit and my DC ordered the lemon curd. I saw a croissant and decided to try it as use it as benchmark. I ordered a cappuccino as well. Cappuccino was forgettable a poorly pulled shot topped with scorched milk.  Coffee was decent apparently.  Croissant tasted better than it was due to being warm. But the lack of desirable features started to show after a bit. Below average. Now the dessert high marks on presentation. The experience faltered after the first bite as it was just a rush of sugar. The passion fruit partly saved the first dessert. The lemon dessert was not good. Once one factors in the price point 2,5 stars."}
{"text":"Slightly overpriced ($7 for three smaller-than-my-palm scones, $5 a teapot, $3 croissant) for students... Good atmosphere, nice place for brunch (which goes til 5pm). A place to visit once but won't return any time soon."}
{"text":"I\"m surprised by the extremes of the reviews here. I think that DT is pleasant, but not something I'd go out of my way to experience.  The restaurant has a very pretty interior that immediately impressed me as being brighter and airer than whatever was there before. Walking in to a case filled with beautifully decorated pastries also raises the level of anticipation for an experience that will be something special.  My friend and I both had the pear and cheese omelette which was quite nice and served with salad and a 1/2 croissant. Reasonably priced in my opinion. Service was efficient and pleasant. House wines are from the Niagara region, but I\"m hesitant to knock them for what might be an effort to support our local farmers.  No complaints, but nothing to rave about. I would revisit it if I was in the neighbourhood looking for something to eat, but there are other places I would probably go to first. Its promixity to the St. George Campus makes it a possibility for a quiet business lunch - you can talk and think in there."}
{"text":"I had a very frustrating brunch at DT Bistro.   The menu is out of date. I ordered a Nicoise salad with seared tuna, which apparently is no longer available. The server didn't speak a word of English and was unable to relay this to me, and so I was served a thai mango salad with seared tuna.  Very frustrating.  The Nicoise salad should be crossed off the menu.  I wasn't looking for substitutions I did not order."}
{"text":"I've been to Dessert Trends a few times and the experience has been uneven.  Brunch is rich and tasty, heavier than necessary but delicious nonetheless.  Desserts are...well...a little disappointing on the whole.  My husband said it best when I asked him to compose a review: \"When I go for dessert, I'm looking for layers of flavour and some surprise.  This was exactly what I might have expected, but nothing special.\"  My heart sings for his food snobbery.  I clearly married the right guy.  And I have to agree with him.  The chocolate cake was light and chocolately, but a little flat.  It had none of the ooziness that you'd expect from a flourless cake.  Quoth my husband, \"Where were the little explosions of joy?\"  (He got a little carried away, no?)  My merlot poached pear tart was nice but also nothing that special.    And service is always slow here.  Go for brunch, skip the dessert?"}
{"text":"Last night my girlfriend and I went to DT Bistro for dinner. We were supposed to go to the Blue Jays game the prior night, but something came up, and it didn't happen. As an alternative, I suggested that we go to DT Bistro the following night as it was one of those places that we had passed by on Harbord Street on many occasions and marveled at the menu and the setting. I am happy to say that we were not disappointed.  I did not make a reservation as I was under the impression that DT Bistro was not one of those places where you needed one. We arrived at around 6:30 pm and found that 80% of the tables were filled. Mind you the restaurant is relatively small, with a total seating capacity of maybe 50 people.    We were greeted at the front of the restaurant rather promptly and were given a few different seating choices.  We chose a table on the west end of the dining area as all of the window seats on the east end of the dining area were taken, leaving only one available cramped table on that side.  As a result of having a rather large lunch, I did not have a significant appetite for many of their entrees (there was a range of choices from a lamb burger to pasta to roasted chicken), so I chose the french onion soup topped with gruyere cheese and the avocado and strawberry salad tossed in a light vinaigrette. I find that at many restaurants, french onion soup comes with a healthy dose of sodium, so I was pleasantly surprised that it did not make me want to consume a pitcher of water.  The salad was served on a bed of mixed greens with chunks of avocado, sliced strawberries and cucumbers. For my appetite, the size of the salad was neither too big nor too small. It was just right.  For dessert, I chose the salted caramel/chocolate pudding cup (I'm not sure quite how else to describe its name at this moment). It was simply incredible. Definitely worth the calories. No other description required.  Also, if I had come to the restaurant with a larger appetite, I likely would have chosen the 3 course pre-fixe menu for $25.  My girlfriend ordered the the mushroom pastry for the appetizer and the rack of lamb served on a bed of Israeli cous-cous for the entree. I had a taste of each and enjoyed both. My girlfriend (whom has admitted to having quite high culinary standards), stated that this was one of the best meals that she has had in recent memory.  One thing that I did notice that was a bit of a turn off (resulting in 4 rather than 5 stars) was the fact that as a result of the restaurant's location, and as a result of the fact that all of the windows were open, that the noise levels could be quite high, especially when a bus would stop right in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Discovered Harbord street via recommendations by friends, and DT Bistro seemed popular with Yelpers, so i decided to give it a try.   I really wanted to try the Snow Crab Ricotta Quiche, but it wasn't on the menu today; SADNESS.   But i was curious about the Lemon Shrimp Crepes, so i gave that a whirl.  It was very tasty, albeit a little greasy.  The crepes were stuffed with asiago cheese, shrimps in a bechamel sauce with charred asparagus and onions on the crepes. Taste-wise, so yummy.   I also tried the Goat Cheese Cheesecake with figs. Very subtle and quite good. It was just a tad dry, but flavor-wise, it was good.   Would love to come back and try other brunch dishes as well."}
{"text":"super cute decor and it's really nice in the summer when they have their doors all open.    my first time I came here for lunch and had the Mushroom & Chèvre Sandwich (mushroom & pesto with salad). oh.my.god. probably the best open face sandwich I have ever had! a MUST try.  another time for dinner i started with the mushroom soup which was REALLY good. a large portion as well.  my main was the Mushroom Pappardelle.  It was kind of dry and bland, nothing special at all.  Dessert I got a chocolate mousse cake and I was expecting it to be fantastic since this place is known for their desserts.  SO disappointing though.  The cake was dry and hard, and the mousse was also hard.  it was 2 day old cake, so I told the waitress and returned it. She was super rude and gave me attitude when she brought the creme brulee i ordered instead (which was nothing great).  Her service was bad all night long (which I had no problems when i came for lunch) actually.  I will never come back for dinner again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. The wait staff are nice. We had dessert. It was OK. Nothing to write home to Uncle Balthazar about. But then again, he was always a dessert prude. The black sheep of the family. But another time about him."}
{"text":"If I was basing today's review on my experiences at DT before TODAY, I would have given 4 stars.  Now, we go to 2.  My friend and I came here for lunch.  We were surprised by the lack of vegetarian options.  I am not a vegetarian but there was only one veggie choice per area of the menu.  This was rather unfortunate.    Then, I ordered my sandwich.  I was very excited, as the food has been awesome here in the past.  I usually never complain about my meal but this time I had to: 1/4 of the way through my sandwich and it was FROZEN.  So obviously, I alerted the server who was very apologetic.   They offered to make me a new one.  Then the new one comes, and the egg on top is way overdone (compared to the previous egg on top).  It was like the kitchen just couldn't get it together.  They did their best to remedy the situation and my friend got a free dessert out of it but for me it was very disappointing.  Everyone else around me seemed to really enjoy their meal, so maybe this was an isolated incident but it was enough to really put me off.  I should note, at Christmas time I bought pastries from here and they were amazing and super cute (a mousse Christmas tree etc.)  So, I will give them a try in the future but only if we're going as a group."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and ambiance!   Came here for dinner and was blown away by the thoughtful presentation and attention to detail. The food, which is the most important part, was delicious. We had some seafood and of course, the steak. I'll have to be back for brunch sometime.   The restaurant itself, is gorgeous. I would strongly recommend coming here on a date or if you're trying to impress out of town guests. The interior is beautiful and thoughtfully decorated."}
{"text":"After having had a marvelous dinner at Campagnolo, we decided to go elsewhere for dessert since their dessert menu was rather scant and nothing was calling out to me.  Dessert Trends aka DT Bistro-Patisserie, had been on my to-try list for awhile.  It is not very often that an Asian pastry chef builds a reputation for himself, and so in support of my heritage I decided to give it a try.  Chef Duong is the man behind all of this.  On their website, it states that he has created cakes for the Queen, the Pope, the Prime Minister and other dignitaries.  These people may be high profile individuals, but they must not have very high expectations when it comes to food.  When we arrived, we were asked if we were there for dinner or dessert.  If dinner, please go to the left, to the much nicer seating area, if dessert, please make a right into the nook.   When you walk in, you will be wowed by the display of pastries displayed at the counter.  I found it rather unprofessional and tacky that the signs in front of each sweet good was messily scribbled on a piece of white cardboard/paper in a blue ballpoint pen.  It just made for a sloppy presentation.  Our server had walked past us a dozen times, mostly into the dining room and we were ignored.  It was a good 5-10 minutes before he finally came to take our order.  We decided on the Lemon Meringue Tart and a London Fog.  We had wanted to try the Durian Gelato, but it was sold out.  What a bummer!  Other Asian-inspired desserts were available such as the Lychee & Passionfruit Pannacotta.I have never had a London Fog before.  The London Fog at DT was served as a steamed milk with an Earl Grey tea bag steeping in it.  I found it to be bland, and cold barely taste the tea.  However, this could be because Earl Grey is not a strong tea.  At the end of the day, I felt I paid for a cup of heated milk.  The Lemon Meringue Tart gets points for presentation.  The meringue was not quite as light and airy as I have tasted in the past and I imagine the tart had been sitting in the refrigerated counter for some time which led to a stiffer meringue.  You can definitely tell it was not fresh.  The tart shell was too hard though the lemon filling was quite good.  Verdict:  I was thoroughly disappointed with Dessert Trends. Everything from the lack of service to the ant I saw crawling across the floor.  For $13, I felt the quality was lacking.  I will go elsewhere for my future sugar fix."}
{"text":"DT Bistro serves decent food.  The one thing I can recommend is that they make a cream of mushroom soup that is out of this world. It is worth stopping by to have a bowl."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem in the Harbord/Spadina area and I haven't been disappointed both times I've been here. The food is great, reasonably priced, service is nice, and decor is as girly as can be. I love it all!   The first time coming here I tried the afternoon tea and it was absolutely delightful - reasonably priced ($30 or so/pp) and the food was great. The sandwiches served are not your typical petite sandwiches in high tea locations, and the dessert options were pretty good.   The second time I came here for brunch and the quality of food was superb - I would come back over and over again."}
{"text":"I had a good hamburger at $14. For another $5 you can get the portobello and cheese for another $5. Service was good. The tuna and scallops were fine. The setting is nice. I would give 3.5 but just can't do 4."}
{"text":"Cute place with nice ambiance.  Had a desert and it was OK. I'm not an expert on desserts and admittedly lack a sweet tooth so I may not understand the art of dessert but to me the coconut mango parfait that I had was just OK. I felt the parfait part was really waxy texture, like candle wax almost (looks wise, not sure of taste lol) so overall that killed it for me even though the inside texture was actually quite alright and fluffy enough.  Overall not bad at all and prices are OK so perhaps will be back when in the area again I guess...  A-OK!"}
{"text":"I really love DT Bistro. The food is always excellent. I think they really excel with anything having to do with mushrooms. The mushroom soup is one of a kind. It earthy and creamy without being overwhelmingly heavy. It's so flavourful I admit to dreaming of it on a cold winters day. The mushroom pappardelle is also amazing. The noodles are so fresh and the mushrooms give that perfect chewy texture with a perfect light sauce to really let the mushrooms shine. At lunch the mushroom panini is stellar the goat cheese and the crunch from the focaccia are perfection. My favourite desserts there are the passionfruit guava gelato, or recently had an amazing coconut gelato, as well the raspberry chocolate tart is delightful. Will continue to come back for any special occasion I can!"}
{"text":"I only get dragged here because I continue to fail at getting my friend to try anything new.   So I've been to DT about 5 times in total and I continue to be ho-hummed with their menu but always satisfied with their desert selection (they are a patisserie after all you would expect no less then yumminess in this area).  Get anything - ANYTHING with apple in it. ANYTHING. Seriously, I'm not sure what they do to the apple deserts to make them taste so delicious but I'm pretty sure it involves the head baker massaging the apples lovingly, rubbing them down with a luxurious sheep skin cloth, sprinkling gold dust and fairy tears on them, peeling them while singing lullabies and then while they're nice and lulled into comfortable bliss - baking them into some sort of tart while they least expect it."}
{"text":"PERFECT night for DT Bistro to have all their doorway to the street open as we arrived closer to 9:00 pm and saw 1 table of patron and was greeted shortly by a server. He explained to us the display case was down but the offerings are still there in the tall fridge next to the display.   He also explained that their GELATO are made without any additives and offered to give out samples and sample we did. I personally was given the Mango Cream but then I was curious towards the Salted Caramel but changed back to the Mango Cream after tasting the Salted Caramel.   The Mango Cream($3.50/small) tasted just like Mango and even had a tiny bit of acidity to it that gave it that Mango taste. It could definitely be an excellent palate cleanser between courses. It had what I believe to be a DRIED blood orange slice on top as a garnish.   Desserts($7.50-$8.00) reviews as follows:   Strawberry/Mango/Panna Cotta - I like the Mango Panna Cotta combination as it is common to have a Mango and Cream go well together. I like the Strawberry Panna Cotta combo as well because who doesn't like Strawberry and Cream. However when all three combined, I'm not sure if the Mango goes that well with the Strawberry.   Blueberry(?) Cheesecake - Cheesecake texture and flavour was spot-on but unfortunately I cannot call myself a Cheesecake connoisseur at the moment so I'm A-OK with this for now.  Chocolate Ganache Paramid - Smooth Chocolate Ganache that I'm a FAN of.  What more can I say??  Maybe just to say if I was a Chocolate Addict, this would be my choice within this district.  Chocolate Mousse w/Macaron - Mousse was smooth and creamy with a HINT of something I sadly could not pick out.  As there was a UYE Macaron Event I could not attend, I wanted to try a Macaron for myself and it was A-OK.  As 10:00pm came by we were given INDICATION(Lights) that the shop was closing and we asked and the server said when there's little business it will close earlier than 11:00pm but told as after that we were okay to stay a bit longer.  It was fortunate as a few more patrons came in and chatted with them and purchased some Gelato.  BTW, I give full marks for the service tonight."}
{"text":"Good as always. Didnt try dinner yet, but tea and desert is amazing. Yes its not cheap, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to this place every week since I discovered it a couple of months ago.  Of note, I have been there mostly for brunch and lunch, only a couple of dinner outings.   The building it's housed in is pretty \"classy\" for the price point -- especially considering the other restaurants on the same street.  They are normally under-staffed but the staff they do have is very friendly.  The dinning room only seats about 40-people, so I wouldn't recommend it for larger groups.  On with the food.  One word - WOW.  I would classify the food as a mix of Western, French, and Vietnamese (thank you colonization).  The brunch/lunch menu is superb; you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu.  The grilled mushroom sandwich or pulled pork hoisin wraps are a couple of my staples.  Make sure to wash everything down with a berry box (or any other dessert for that matter).    I think this is the perfect spot to take your significant other.  It's just a cute place."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for a couple of weeks now, so I decided to check this place out yesterday. I arrived there around 3PM and it was empty, but I didn't care lol the desserts were all displayed and there was a lot of variety! My friend and I decided to try five of them, yeah we're fatties lol  All of the dishes came with a side of berry compote as well as a dash of whipped cream. All the dishes were bright and colourful.   This is what we got: 1) Strawberry Cheesecake Nothing special, just normal cheesecake lol  2) Mango Cheesecake Again, nothing special, I regret getting the cheesecakes, should have tried some other patisseries lol  3) Flour-less Chocolate Cake This was the first time I tried flour-less cake and I don't know what the difference is, with or without flour, but this cake was delicious! It was like a lava cake, it had melted chocolate in the middle and it was a nice rich chocolate flavour.  4) Strawberry Mousse  This was yummmmy! The strawberry mousse was designed as a cute bunny's face. Yes, we killed the bunny muhahaha lol   5) Passionfruit Parfait This was my favourite! I can't express how much I loved this dessert. If you decide to check this place out, get the passionfruit parfait! It was amazinggg! I would go back just to get this dessert lol and I will go back for this dessert ahahha  I have the biggest sweet tooth, so I am definitely going to go back to DT Bistro. I want to try the other desserts they offer, no more cheesecake though lol I'm glad I found this place and tried it^^"}
{"text":"DT Bistro is a great place for dinner, dessert, coffee or tea.  The space is beautiful and the food was really tasty.   Let's start with the space.  It was recently renovated and it is stunning.  It's a narrow space with high ceilings, but done beautifully with a French-inspired theme.  Upon entering, there is a beautiful marble showcase which displays Chef Don's cakes like pieces of art.  The seating area is nice and comfy with a tufted banquette running along one of the walls.  There are lots of windows to let in natural light, which lights up the creamy-toned room.  The room is anchored with a beautiful lamp made out of wood branches.   You should also check-out the 2nd floor, which has a lovely rooftop herb garden, which contains over 24 different kinds of herbs!  No food service on the garden, but worth checking-out on its own.  Okay, onto the food.  I really enjoyed most of what I had and felt the pricing was really reasonable.  -Mussels.  Served in a curry sauce with delicious bread.  Mussels were plump, meaty and cooked perfectly.  The sauce was so tasty, we asked for extra bread to mop it up -Stuffed calamari.  This was pretty innovative.  A calamari ring stuffed with tomato sauce and pork.  The calamari was a lil overcooked, but the stuffing was full of flavour and had a great texture.  It was sublime.  The tomato sauce in the dish tasted fresh and really paired well with the other flavours in the dish -Mushroom parpadelle.  Okay, I have a weakness for freshmade pasta.  This one did not disappoint.  Lovely wide egg noodles served in a rich buttery mushroom sauce.  There were several different kinds of mushrooms in the pasta, all delicious.  It didn't knock my socks of, but was really tasty ($16)  -Beef Short ribs.  Oh.  Fall off the bone tender and dip it in the amazing port reduction.  These were some darned good short-ribs.  I didn't like the rosti that came with the dish.  It was bland and didn't hold together.  Serving size was really generous!  ($18) -Desserts.  We had the fruit creme brule tart and the mango-coconut cake.  Both were beautiful and the perfect end to our meal. The desserts did not disappoint  This was a real winner in my books.  The space is beautiful.  Food was fresh, tasty, generously portioned and well priced.  Dessert appropriately belongs in the name!     Oh, I should mention that this is definitely a nice, but casual dining spot.  Service could be more refined.  I found it slow at times and not particularly attentive."}
{"text":"Its all about the food. Great brunch spot with creative menu options. I went for the omlette stuffed with cheese and pear. Awesome! Serving size was plentiful and it came with side salad. My friend had the very curious sounding coconut savoury pancakes-wow! I tried one of them, hearty and soft with sweet and sour flavours  This is great food. I like it better than Mildred's Temple Kitchen-they both have similar dining ambience but the flavours at DT are outstanding and win hands down."}
{"text":"Great open seating in the summer for brunch. Surprisingly  well crafted plates. At teh end, you can indulge in their desserts."}
{"text":"I've always love this dessert place when I was studying at University of Toronto.  Ever since I graduated, I had only been here twice, both times were because my friend and I had some desserts cravings after a long day at work.  This place was renovated last year and the place looks ever more beautiful than before.  I never actually tried their main courses, so my review will strictly be on the coffee and desserts.  Talk about desserts, this place makes some beautiful desserts.  (They actually sell some of their desserts at Patisserie).  The appearances of the various desserts just make you want to devour them all!   Don't worry, the desserts actually taste very good as well.  I tried their lattes as well, it was decent but I had better ones elsewhere.  If you are in downtown near the University of Toronto St. George campus, I recommend you to check out this place for their desserts, you will enjoy looking at them and eating them!"}
{"text":"Such a good place! I went here 2 days before they closed down permanently. Really sad because this place is so beautiful, and their dessert are over the top although it's a bit pricey. Their food wasn't too bad either, i love their omelette. I was talking with the patron, if they are going to open in the other location, they said not in the near future. Hope they're going to open up again!"}
{"text":"While the food was average, the service leaves a lot to be desired. The service is not attentive and careless. We waited 20 min for our order to arrive. Then, when the bill was requested, it got split in 2! Even though we did not order the exact meal! We were told, you said split in 2. We said, we asked for separate bills. Then the waitress raised her voice to argue with us. I shut that down immediately. She apologized. But I felt disappointed in the quality of the establishment.  The orange juice was freshly squeezed and not acidic."}
{"text":"Walking by this place I feel should be on the narrow streets of Paris? With it's large double doors opening up to the street with tables placed just inside with its seats full of a variety of clientele from college kids to well off baby boomers. Upon entering your eyes focus on a huge assortment of delicious looking deserts of all shapes and colours. But thats not it, they also have a menu with various sandwiches, soups and more. The staff,  at the end of a long day seemed tired but were still attentive.  The food was not only appealing to the eyes, but also was delicious. I would defiantly be back."}
{"text":"What an adorable place! I love all the decor on the ceiling :)  Service was excellent. We came here for a Sunday brunch session.  DRINKS: * Coffee * Cappuccino  BISTRO EGGS BENEDICT (4/5) (Smoked Salmon, Croissant, Hollandaise) The hollandaise sauce was delicious - very yummy and the portions were huge!   SEARED AHI TUNA AND BACON SANDWICH (4/5) (Sesame Crusted Tuna, Bacon Strips, Side Salad or Fries) The seared tuna was very fresh. I would prefer this more if they added more sauce in the sandwich, but my sis, who ordered it, preferred it without the sauce haha  CHIPOTLE SHORT RIB SANDWICH (3/5) The meat was a little dry, which made it harder to finish up (we had so much leftovers for this one!)  VEAL CHEEK CURRY (4/5) (Grilled Veal Cheek, Vietnamese Curry, Coconut Milk, Side Naan, House Pickle) We all thought this was a weird choice for a brunch session but my boyfriend ended up ordering this anyways. This was actually really delicious! Good job haha. The veal cheek was very tender and juicy. The curry was just the right amount of spiciness - we asked for \"regular\" spicy."}
{"text":"Came here to meet up with a bunch of friends for afternoon tea and the food and atmosphere were great!  We got seated upstairs and ended up having the whole floor to ourselves (we were a group of 8) -- the ambience was great!  The only thing that was an issue was that they didn't turn on the heating until the owner noticed partway through our meal.  Apparently one of his employees was new and did not know how to work the thermostat.  That aside, all eight of us got afternoon tea sets and the food on each tier was great.  The teapots they gave us were bigger than we all expected and we were surprised by how good each piece of food was.  Will definitely come back to try their brunch and dessert menu!"}
{"text":"3.5   Pretty accurate overall rating! The food was actually great, especially the savoury things--which is why I chose to bump this up to four stars. My friend ordered the noodles with the duck confit and it was SO GOOD! Definitely coming back for that. The place is also really cute, great for baby showers and bridal parties.   However the service was just alright--there was a lot of kerfuffle prior to our seating. There was also inadequate air conditioning, so the mucky smell and heat from the rain remained even after they moved our table inside. They were also tight on space so we were tucked away upstairs surrounded by extra chairs and tables... Which is fine, but there wasn't quite enough space for the food we ordered so that was sort of inconvenient.   Overall though, I still had a great time because of the company I came with. The tea was delicious and the portions were great. Definitely give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Donald is a great French trained chef. You can tell how professional by the taste of the fresh food, the delicious baked treats, their professionalism, service and total ambience. Thanks,"}
{"text":"After years . ( recall 1st open on Weston) Went in. -  2 desserts Pear tart.  Brûlée tart Filling mildly bland Pastry doughy clumsy flavourless Really Nostalgia isn't what it used to be??? A bomb in Paris"}
{"text":"I've been here twice - once for a dinner in their private dining room and another for high tea; both were great, but the second is what prompted me to write a review.  So many places overcharge for high tea (you know which places I'm talking about!), but this place provides a lovely, quality experience for a reasonable price.  The savory pieces were rich and flavourful... I was almost full before I even got to the desserts. Luckily, I'm a greedy and persistent person because the desserts were decadent and popping with freshness.  The decor also adds to the experience - there are giant flower pieces hanging over the ceiling, which are beautiful without being tacky, and large double windows that bring light and airiness to the dining room.  Last, but not least, the staff are absolute sweethearts - even the owner/manager (I think?) checked on us and also thanked us at the end.  Great work, DT Bistro! :)"}
{"text":"Completely fantastic brunch. I had the roasted pear and cheddar omelette, which was a beautiful balance of flavors. My brunch mate had the sausage on cornbread, which was the perfect combination of spicy and sweet. Good service, beautiful building, and interesting teas were a bonus."}
{"text":"DT Bistro is absolutely gorgeous! I love the lighting of the restaurant in the afternoon - plenty of natural light. Really lovely music in the background too. It is not too noisy either  I shared the almond crunch and lemon meringue cake with two other people - huge portion! It came with a side of berry preserve and a scoop of raspberry sorbet. I've never had a dessert quite like. The meringue just melts in your mouth! The texture of the crunchy almond biscuit and the creamy lemon meringue complement each other really well! Highly recommend going to try the desserts and if not, then to enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant! Plus, they have unlimited refills on their coffees."}
{"text":"Delightful little place for desserts or weekend brunch. The space is airy and light. Right when you enter, you will be overwhelmed with all the different tarts, cakes, and such on display. The presentation is stunning, each is a beautiful (and labour-intensive) work of art. For instance, the tiramisu comes in a delicate chocolate eggshell. The brunch dishes are great too. The goat cheese frittata with veggies is delicious and leaves just enough room for dessert. Service can be slow, depending on how busy it is. Sometimes during peak hours on weekends, you will have to wait. But they take reservations, if you'd rather call first from home."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely beautiful. With the flowered decor pieces on the ceiling and by the pastry counter, to their paintings and general interior decor.. just so romantic and appealing to the eye. I sat down to try their grapefruit champagne parfait. It was plated with passion fruit (?) syrup and berries on the side. The dessert itself was encased in white chocolate. Presentation was on par with the feel of the restaurant. Fancy and classy. Only downside it that it's pretty expensive ($8.50 for one).   Note that this place will be closing as of November 1, 2016. The waitress said they'll probably open up a new location after a few months. I would like to try their regular menu items before then."}
{"text":"Super cute place! My friends and I came here during the summer and the first thing we noticed was how brightly lit the place was. The windows are huge with lots of sunlight coming in and their walls are decorated with really nice paintings. Definitely a great atmosphere to enjoy a nice afternoon tea!  In terms of the food, I would give it a 7/10. I ordered an Asian beef brisket noodle dish and for some reason I was expecting a Cantonese style beef brisket noodle soup (haha). The noodles actually didn't come with soup and it was more of a fusion style noodle with Western style beef brisket and Asian style noodles at the bottom. I was quite satisfied with it even though there could have been more sauce.   If you're going to visit DT bistro, their desserts are a must try! They are a patisserie after all. My friends and I split a few of their cakes (which are located at the front of the store) and they all left us speechless. I forgot which specific cakes we tried but you can't go wrong with any of them. Last but not least, I ordered a mango lassi (Vietnamese milkshake) and it tasted pretty good - not really worth it for the price though. You should save your money for their cakes!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch recently, and I'd say the 3.5 rating on Yelp is pretty accurate. It's a cute place, and they have a variety of different menu options so there should be something for everyone. Though the food isn't super unique, or outstanding, but just solid. And I don't necessarily want to pay 16-18 dollars for just solid egg and bread dishes. You can find a better brunch in this city for 13-14 dollars a plate at places like Emma's Country Kitchen or Barque Smokehouse.   You are paying more money basically for the ambience alone, as the service is rather slow and spotty. For instance, we asked if we could get seperate bills and the server said \"no problem\". What came was one bill, and a total per person (so divided by the number of our party). Also the majority of the people who were served coffee initially got cold coffee, though they corrected it..  My girlfriend had the pork sausage on cornbread. She liked it, but said it was a bit too saltly. I had the lemon dill scrambled eggs, which did come with a generous portion of smoked salmon. It was pretty good, but not good enough that I'd want to run back to have it. Overall the menu comes off as interesting, but a lot of the \"seasonal\" items on it are not available, even dishes with mushrooms.  If you are looking for a place that has the vibe and appearance of a baby shower, or wedding shower, then this is the place for you. Though it's definitely not a place I would brunch every weekend."}
{"text":"Went with my afternoon tea buddy, ST. We made a reservation for a Sunday afternoon at 3.30pm. She tried to phone but nobody picked up. Luckily they answered my email!  It was busy when we go there but we were seated pretty quickly. I love the room which is full of windows and really nicely decorated. It has a clean, modern look and loved the chandeliers!  Service was a bit inattentive and they were very slow to serve us. This may have been due to it being very busy that afternoon, and they were pleasant when they did come to our table-but it did detract from the experience.  The afternoon tea itself was really impressive, however! The tea was good and they topped up the pot with hot water frequently. It's not just boring sandwiches either-we had spring rolls with dipping sauce, cheese and pear tartlets, mushroom strudel and shrimp crostini. All were really good. Scones were served with jam, fruit curd and whipped cream and were light and fluffy. Pastries were macarons, lemon and chocolate tarts and a black sesame cake. The cake was my least favourite-but I think that's because of my unsophisticated tastes! They also had no problem packing up some of the remainders to take home.  We left full and very happy. The time just flew! We're planning on going back after spending much of our time staring at the group next to us who had the most delicious looking mountain of meat. We think it was the bouef bourgignon. It's on our to-do list. For Yelp, of course."}
{"text":"It's difficult for me to put my finger on it, but despite the lovely stucco exterior/Euro interior, this place was quite forgettable.  An underlying reason may be my disdain for \"brunch\", a.k.a. an overpriced meal in-between breakfast/lunch.  Just charge the same, keep it simple, and we'll be good!  There were both brunch + lunch menus on the table, but when the waitress came to take our order, we were told that we were only able to order off the brunch menu. :(  Again, GRRR on you, brunch!  Earl Grey tea that I ordered was watered down crap.  It may have been loose leaf, but they place it into a bag to contain the leaves.  Again, not a good quality of tea either that or not enough leaves.  At $3, I'm sure Celestial Seasonings would've packed a stronger punch.  I ended up ordering the Soft Shell Crab on Brioche - $14.  It was fine, although it was strangely plated with a random piece of roasted potato placed in front of the salad which happened to be cold.  Despite the fancy schmancy sound, it was just awh-ight.  Nothing special.  Desserts LOOKED nice, but I was full from brunch, and didn't want to overdo it.  (Plus, I was afraid to ask how much each item cost!)  Tasted a piece of the Double Chocolate Tart and it was fine, not mouth-watering or anything.  I think the prices at DT Bistro just go to match the décor 'cause the food certainly does not measure up!"}
{"text":"Went here for weekend brunch. The place is smack in the middle of a residential neighborhood. The exterior is very pleasing and the interior is chic with fascinating wall art. The menu looked really promising but the flavors were underwhelming. We quite enjoyed the lavender passion fruit mimosa although the passion fruit seeds were annoying. We had a couple of mains - Coconut Onion Corn Pancakes and Goat Cheese Frittata. Initial few bites were interesting but it got fairly one dimensional subsequently. I quite liked the caramelization of onions in the frittata but it was too heavy and the goat cheese was spread inconsistently. We picked up some pastries on our way out and weren't too impressed. They were nothing memorable. It's a good place for families to go to brunch but the service was a touch cold. Our first server couldn't even give us a recommendation from the menu and we had to summon a different server to help us place the order."}
{"text":"I recently made my third visit to the venue with a dining out social Group. I declined the prix fixe menu and ordered calamari and vegetables with mushrooms and black rice. Everything was very good. The service was fairly prompt until we finished dessert at which time the lack of a second server became apparent. My previous two visits to the venue were for brunch and this was my first time having dinner there; I'd be more likely to go back for brunch again rather than dinner."}
{"text":"Food wise: great value. So simple - the menu is great. The prefixe's are such a good deal."}
{"text":"We went there for coffee and dessert and had a nice relaxed time. The place is painted in cool tones and the French windows with the summer breeze blowing through them, greatly add to the good times.  I've had better coffee but the pastries were all around great. We had a pecan tart, a lemon meringue pie, a chocolate mousse cake and mango sorbet. The chef was friendly as was the waitress, and they both chatted us up. It was also nice that they didn't try to hurry us even though we had come during dinner time but didn't order food food. I noticed that it's a BYOB, in addition to their drinks menu, which is great!"}
{"text":"Did a girls' night here this week and was thrilled with the experience. The service was fantastic and the atmosphere was fun without being overwhelming. I had the Thai seafood soup and it was delicious - a nice balance of spice and freshness. Needless to say anyplace with desert in the name has set out some expectations and DT does not disappoint. You really can't go wrong with everything from decadent chocolate to my favourite the Passion Fruit Mango tart the deserts are fresh and tasty - a perfect end to a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Such a pretty place in the neighbourhood of Harbor and Spadina.  I love how they decorate the space with pretty flowers hung on the ceiling and marble tiles on the wall. The large windows also gave it a very airy and inviting feeling. Perfect place for a date or hang out with girlfriends.   We came here for dinner on a Wednesday. It wasn't too busy so we got very prompt service. Our dishes were very tasty at a very reasonable price.  We were provided with complimentary appie after we ordered our entree, it's always a nice gesture when restaurants offer complimentary appies.  For dinner, we ordered a rack of lamb, served with black rice and asparagus. The lamb was so tender and juicy. We thought the black rice was a perfect compliment to the lamb not to mention healthy too.  My husband's salmon clay pot was also tasty.  It was loaded with mushroom with a hint of dill and lemon. Tasted super fresh.    They offer 3 course menu set for $30 which also comes with a appie and dessert. It's a very good deal in my opinion.   This is a gem in the neighbourhood. I'm looking forward to going back and trying their afternoon tea!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Dessert Trends for years now and haven't been able to switch to calling it by it's new streamlined \"DT Bistro\" name. Call it whatever you want though, this place has always been great. It would be unfathomable for anyone to not get the hint from their name and the consistently spectacular front entrance display case that their specialty is in desserts, but it must be noted that their savoury dishes are also amazing.  One of my fondest meal memories from DT features a snow crab quiche that was featured on their seasonal menu. The flaky pastry and rich, flavourful filling still haunts me in my foodie daydreams years later.    My most recent lunchtime visit there was to celebrate a friend's birthday. My deconstructed beef short rib pie was served with scrumptiously juicy sauteed mushrooms. My guest of honour's calamari seaweed salad was reported to be a perfect balance of flavours. As always, it took a while for us to finalize our decisions for dessert, but it was all well worth saving room for."}
{"text":"Love their brunch menu.   Very creative French Vietnamese fusion food.  Newly renovated.  It's a good place to go with your girlfriends or on a brunch date (if you want to impress your mom)."}
{"text":"2.7, not more  I love desserts and good pastries. But if you want to sell pretty fancy pastries, they should all be and taste absolutely perfect and sold in a perfectly clean (at least-really-trying-to-be...) place. Renovating is one thing, keeping it clean is another one and irreproachable. Service was amateurish, tables looked like recycled ones, cleaned with a dirty cloth only once you're seated.   Please work on this! Pastries will likely taste better already!"}
{"text":"One of my fav places in the city. Definitely a must-try: scallop with mushrooms and spring rolls with mango salsa were amazing! The mushroom pappardelle was great for its fresh-made pasta. To end it off, try the passion fruit parfait. A no-no for their macaroons though!"}
{"text":"My friends and I made a 40 minute walking detour to try the the desserts here based on my friend's recommendation who had been there a few years back. Well, it turns out the walk was worth it. Although the desserts looked amazing, we all ended up getting the ice cream. All the unique flavours are what really made this place stick out. I had the Champagne Grapefruit (which apparently measures in at about 5% alcohol!), Blueberry Cassis, and Guiness (yup, as in the beer)! All excellent. They also had Durian (the Southeast Asian fruit that smells like rotting meat), Pina Colada, and Almond Butter, to name a few others.  Another reason for bringing me to rate this place was the service. Not only did they let us sample as many flavours as we wanted, they even seemed to encourage it!  All in all it was a great experience, and don't let the size of the bowls mislead you - they give you about twice as much ice cream as the bowl can handle..."}
{"text":"I love Dessert Trends! It has qualities that makes me fall in love...  - Cute and Good Looking: nicely decorated  - Great Personality: cheerful(in a sunny afternoon) and romantic(in the evening with the dim lighting) - Tasty and Delicious: the lobster pasta for $20 is great! chunks of lobster tail and freshly made pasta!  - Sweet yet Healthy: all those desserts and gelato... what more can I say.. and especially if it is made in house by their own chef! - Patient and Understanding: our waiter is soft spoken and polite. Did not even blink when we just order 1 main to share and bring us complimentary bread!  Sweet Sweet DT! I will be back!"}
{"text":"DT Bistro is just so damn cute, I keep meaning to try it as I have to walk by it almost every day. Finally made it in for lunch and dessert with my sister and had a pretty great experience.   The decor and atmosphere is lovely, especially with the big windows on a sunny day. It was pretty packed so we sat at a little table in the back corner but still no complaints here.   We both ordered salads (mango shrimp and roasted pepper and goat cheese) and weren't disappointed. I would suggest the mango shrimp salad as I feel you get more bang for your buck but the presentation on the goat cheese salad was nothing short of five star and the taste didn't come up short either. We also shared a smoothie, and while it was pretty small, it was delicious and fresh and well worth it.   You absolutely can't come here without trying one of their desserts. They will stare you in the eye until you order one! We had some chocolate mousse tower thingy of goodness and it was to die for! The service was also very good.   To be honest, I'm a student and this place is a little pricier than where I would normally go. My sister and I both threw in a twenty and that was enough for the bill + tip. So while it was more than I would normally spend on lunch, it was well worth it and a great treat!"}
{"text":"I ate here.  & didn't have dessert.  Is that a shocker?  Believe me, I'll be back for some of the decadent treats on display when you first walk in.  I was here for a birthday luncheon.  We didn't intend for this to be our final resting spot but after discovering Harbord House was closed for the day to redo their flooring, we continued in a hungry stupor down the street.  & let me tell you: it was pretty delicious.  I was in a brunch-y place, even though it was close to 3pm.  I originally ordered ricotta pancakes but was told after a few minutes that they had just run out of ricotta.  Instead of 'regular' pancakes (no way, suckers!) I ordered this coconut waffle dish instead.  Oh my.  Oh yum.  HANDS OFF.  Service was a little on the slow side, but I think the server was covering the whole place & if that was the case - she was doing the best she could since it was rather hopping - even for Valentine's Day.  It was also a little pricier than I would have preferred - they didn't have a spanning range of $$ choice.  A nice gesture: Given an order of pancakes with extra berry compote to 'make up' for the no ricotta.  Very maple-soaked & delicious.  I'm saving future stars for trying out the desserts + coffees.  You might think that makes me stingy but I have to make every star count."}
{"text":"DT Bistro seems to be suffering from a bit of an identity crisis. Is it a French patisserie? A Vietnamese fusion restaurant? A homey brunch place? From decor to menu, the whole place is a bit confused. That's not to say it's not delicious. Because it is very, very damn delicious.  My friend and I started with the mini Buttermilk Scones, served with lemon curd and raspberry jam. I ordered the Lemon Dill Scramble, with soft brioche, smoked salmon and asiago. My friend got the seasonal Soft-Shell Crab Sandwich on brioche with bacon and avocado. The scones were good and buttery, if a bit small. The jams were very tasty. My brioche was perfectly chewy against the scrambled eggs and the salty salmon, and the side salad (usually the bummer of the brunch plate) was delicious. My friend loved his sandwich, and again, the brioche nailed it.   Even though we were stuffed, we had to try some of their desserts. DT has one of the most beautiful pastry cases I've ever seen - from tarts and cakes to cheesecakes and pastries. They definitely don't mess around. We chose the Double Dark Chocolate Tart, with dark chocolate shavings and blackberries, and the Creme Brûlée Tart with white chocolate, whipped cream and berries. Perfect buttery crusts, deep decadent fillings....we destroyed them faster than you can say \"time for cardio.\"  Sure, it's a bit overpriced, and like I said before it doesn't know what the hell kind of restaurant it is. But I enjoyed every bite of my brunch and would definitely come back. Maybe for the Afternoon Tea!"}
{"text":"When you enter DT (aka \"Dessert Trends\") Bistro you're immediately greeted by an overwhelming panoply of delicious cakes, tarts, souffles and mousses. If I had to guess I'd say there were about 40 different individual-sized selections, each one more beautifully crafted than the next. Mind-numbing to say the least...  Service was pleasant and attentive despite the obnoxious enormity of our group. They handled us well. Thank goodness for making reservations (highly recommended) in advance.   The brunch menu is wonderfully inventive and includes things like \"healthy green apple seaweed and sweet baby calamari with lemon miso vinaigrette,\" \"Canadian Snow Crab quiche,\" and \"open face, crispy and runny duck egg sandwich topped with pesto shrimp, roasted pepper and sweet onion.\" I couldn't help but LOL at this unfortunate menu typo: \"French toast served with maple syrup and mixed barriers.\"  I ordered the lemon dill cheddar cheese scrambled eggs topped (or rather, sided, so I could pass them along to a fellow diner) with smoked salmon on toasted brioche ($11.50). The brioche was eggy and delicious and while the lemon and dill stood out incredibly well in the scramble, the cheddar cheese (was it in there? I don't know) did not. There were also a lot of onions in the scramble (not indicated in the menu). Still dill-icious (!). The side salad was great as well and so was the lone, halved fingerling potato hanging out on my plate. I could have eaten a dozen more of those.   After sloppily shoving brunch down our gullets we got back to anticipating dessert. I was practically ready to fight myself; I was so torn between about five different desserts (Lemon Meringue, Pumpkin Tart, Chocolate Raspberry Tart, Raspberry Cheesecake, Lemon Lavendar Tart). Kate M and I ended up splitting the first two although admittedly I didn't really want to share mine, it was SO tart. With every passing day I love lemon desserts more and more and this was no exception. I would come back here just to buy a few of these for takeaway. Pumpkin tart was equally toothsome and the filling was smooth and velvety.   DT Bistro alleges to be opening a new bistro location \"in late 2009\" (hi, it IS late 2009) but no location has been chosen yet. Let me go ahead and nominate Leslieville. :)"}
{"text":"Do NOT go to DT Bistro because they will transform your perception of dessert beyond recognition, so bad that you would never like the dessert anywhere else.  I refuse to recommend anything. You'll be mind-***ed when you see the line-up....  Warning: quite pricey and addictive!"}
{"text":"So DT Bistro stands for Dessert Trends Bistro and Patisserie. Oh what a patisserie indeed!  They have such delicious desserts on display but that's now what we went there for.  The bf and I went there for a spur of the moment afternoon tea. He said that the tea cups they give you were perfectly shaped to stir your tea. Whatever that means. Lol. I got the peppermint tea (my go-to flavour) and the bf got some blood orange tea which he liked very much.   The tea service didnt' come with your typical boring sandwiches over here: smoked salmon on mini croissant, short rib and onion balsamic, and a pear and brie crostini (special order). It also came with a choice of daily soup (mushroom) or spring rolls. We got both and they were both delicious. The spring rolls weren't boring ones you get at Chinese restaurants. It was tofu and mushrooms with mango relish & lime vinaigrette. Also, the short rib was nice and tender!! I think, that alone, can fill you up. :)  As a side note, I just want to say that the service here was great. I called in sometime in the morning to make reservations and the host/server made note of my issues. Then when we arrived, the server took note of my dietary request and provided me with options.  Not only does it come with scones, it also came with a blue berry pound cake. Tasted great with the lemon curd. The menu said it should also come with devonshire cream but it was more like... date and maple? Not a regular berry jam.  Dessert was a macaron on top of this fruit cup with passion sauce. And an almond tart.  I didn't even finish my scone or my pound cake.  This place is definitely worth visiting for afternoon tea. I know it's not some posh hotel but seriously, the decor in the place is very nice. Very modern. Even their bathrooms were nice.  Also, for the price of $28, you're definitely getting your money's worth! The server was very knowledgeable of all their offerings and very accommodating. I guess my only issue is that while it's downtown, it's not what I consider downtown \"core\". But if my date biked there on a blistering cold winter night, you can get there no problem. There's also parking right across the street."}
{"text":"Ok place near university of Toronto campus.  We went to celebrate a birthday on Friday night.  We had reservations.   The service was the slowest I have ever experienced.  We took 3 hrs for dinner.   Started with Appetizers: Mushroom Soup which was very nice and flavorful, the Crab Cakes, Calamari and Special soup which was Shrimp with a corn base.   All were really nice, great flavors.  Started off well.  Then it took 1 hr to get the main course.   This course was ok.   We had the mushroom pasta (ok), chicken (ok), beef (good).   By the time the food showed up we were tired and maybe the bar had gone up by then.  The deserts of double chocolate art was fine, the creme brule was mediocore.   You can do much better in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday early afternoon for some brunch with a friend. Atmosphere was great, love the windows letting all the sunlight in. Food was great, we had the three cheese quiche and some blood orange tea. We stayed for around 2 hours and I have to admit service is a bit spotty, and didn't get better as people started leaving around 3PM.   Overall great place and would go back for brunch sunday or lunch on weekday."}
{"text":"My go-to place for a lunch or dessert stop when catching up with family/friends. There's always seating when I come in and the airy atmosphere is stress relieving. I'm only giving 4 stars though because of the low selection of desserts during my most recent visit."}
