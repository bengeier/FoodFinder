{"text":"Omg!! This is my new favorite spot in downtown Phoenix!!! They showed love from the front door to the kitchen! Everybody was dressed to impressed and the music was impeccable!!! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I went to Michael's at the old location and had always liked it.  With the move to a new location, I had higher expectations.  

Yesterday was my first time to the new location.  And I really do like the decor and the various levels.  But I do feel like the main entertainment area is too small for the crows that you draw.  

The service last night was awful!  My group sat at a table for 20 minutes and never saw a waitress.  I I went upstairs, figuring we had to order at the bar and bring it back.  I waited at the bar for 10 minutes, for the bar tender to make three drinks and add ice to a drink.  And when I asked how we get food and drinks  downstairs, she informed me that there were three waitresses down there.  Now that area is not so large that I would miss the waitresses!  Anyway, I went back downstairs and waited.  A waitress finally appeared and we ordered drinks and food.  We got our drinks fifteen minutes later.  ONE HOUR later, we finally got our food!  We ordered another round of drinks.....They never came.  We just gave up and closed our tab.

Moral of the story....Don't go for the food....Or make sure to bring a bag of chips to tie you over!!

The entertainment was awesome!  Flight 407 is very talented, energetic, and engaging."}
{"text":"Great place with a great staff. I go here every chance I get a chance to get out. I also have my networking events here because of its Central location."}
{"text":"Went with my 18 year old son to listen to jazz and eat dinner. We never got through the front door because my son is not 21 years old. We've gone to many music venues without being turned away because of his age. They will not see me or my family again..."}
{"text":"Attended an all white event masquerade party over Labor Day weekend 2017.  Extremely poor customer service!!!! Staff messed up our food order and didn't offer to fix.  Rude and unprofessional staff!"}
{"text":"1st time going, it was so much fun! Loved the atmosphere and the energy! Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Took a family member who was visiting from out of state. Generally, \"not my type of party\" (i.e. ridiculously loud music, overpriced drinks, pretensions people, etc.). The bartender charged me $23 for French Connection and a Brandy Sour after she feigned ignorance of not knowing the cost of the drinks, pretending to add it up in her head. I didn't contest the drink charge as it was only a few dollars extra to me. However, I thought it was a very underhanded and low class think to do. I don't think I looked \"brand new\" or like I was trying to impress anyone but she apparently thought I did. My wife was more pissed than it. In addition, after confirming what should go in the French connection (Hennessy and Gran Marnier) she corrected me by stating the it was called a \"Beautiful\" that I ordered, not a French Connection. Everywhere I've ordered that drink they've correctly prepared it under that name. Nonetheless I'll never return there again. 

BTW, the bartender was a slightly taller dark complexioned black female w/ what appeared to be a few teeth missing. Almost forgot to mention the overly exposed bar maids (i.e. \"titties all out\"). I think this is supposed to be \"sexy\" but I found it to be another example of the place being a pretentious and low class establishment. Seeing a bar maids overly exposed breasts is not going to detract me from the fact that the bartender just gouged me for a drinks. Blu Martini (Sunday's)... far better crowd and environment... trust me."}
{"text":"So We were looking for a fun place to hang out.. Stopped at this place... My husband was not allowed in because he was in sandals...? Really we live in Phoenix not the fashion capital of the 'world...happy this place must be so successful.. That they can turn peeps away..."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and it was fantastic. The fried catfish, greens and cole slaw warmed my Southern heart!! All were perfect! I really like the new location and upgraded digs! I can't wait to come back for happy hour or on a Friday night."}
{"text":"OK where do I start.......

Last night was Michael's re-grand opening which is now located in Central Phoenix. It's was easy to find with great parking. 

As my girlfriend and I walk towards the club at the entrance was a pretty girl with a fierce short hair cut collecting a $10 entrance fee. 

As we walked in we could barely catch our breath it was wall to wall crowded. 

We were greeted my a familiar face our other girlfriend who looked amazing in a lady in red number. (making all the boys turn heads) 

In our mid conversation a young women asks us for our drink orders so excited I rattle off my request and off she goes into the crowd.....NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN....NEVER! 

That's right we never saw the waitress again. We waited for about 40 mins in the same spot....and waited.  At this point we decided to walk over to the crowd that look like there was a 75% sale going on at Barney's..... It was crazy!! Deciding that their was no way my 5'1\" mini self was going to go through that crowd to order a drink.... 

We retreated down stairs........leading us to a live band playing. They sounded good but still no space to sit or stand. There were table and chairs which were clearly taken by purses and sweater that people left to hold their spot. 

There wasn't really a dance floor so people had to dance on the stage with the band.... I'm sure the band wasn't excited about that.  

Okay!!!! I need a drink.... So we proceeded upstairs now this is were the dance floor has been hiding. At first it looks huge....(super impress) until I noticed it was half the size due to the mirrors on the other side making the dance floor appear bigger! WHAT!!!! The dance floor was small.... (so disappointed) 

I need a drink...... Still looking for a bar?!? 

WE FOUND IT....

Another barricade of people surrounding the bar.. with multiple people waiting on drinks and guess what... ONLY TWO BARTENDERS 

How can you have a grand opening, knowing that people are going to come and support you and not have enough bartenders to take care of their customers...just doesn't make sense!

These two poor souls couldn't take orders fast enough... We had to make friends with someone sitting at the bar and she was able to order us drink after another hour wait.  

As I was handed a solo cup half way filled with white wine. I never drink wine in a cup before you would think at a grand opening I would have a celebratory glass of wine. 

I'm telling you this place was packed to capacity. People were spilling out of every hole in this place. 

There was no room to walk,no room to dance, no room to even enjoy glass of wine. Every corner you found to sit in someone was trying to share it with you. There was no crowd control and that could be dangerous. 

I really want to enjoy Michaels but it was so disorganized that you couldn't enjoy the music, the people or the establishment. It was like walking in a tunnel and the moment my girlfriend and I saw light......... WE RAN AND DIDN'T TURN BACK!!!

Michael's has great future potential but for now they need to work on the tiny screws and bolts that are missing before it falls apart."}
{"text":"My sister invited me here for her birthday. She told me that she always goes here. When I got there about 10pm, it was music being played before the live music. When the singer came up, he was great and entertaining! Then the real fun began at about 11:45 with a DJ! 

The drinks were good. The crowd is VERY DIVERSE, which is nice. 

We did leave our cards there at the end of the night and were automatically charged a 20% tip for doing so when they closed out the cards...."}
{"text":"The staff there is unbelievable they are excellent very courteous and enjoy what they do thank you for letting me have a great time with you guys"}
{"text":"Disappointing. We are new to the area and our friends have mentioned this place to us. My husband and I came for the NYE party - what a mistake. The guy at the door had an attitude from the start. The buffet consisted of bland tasting food and fruit that wasn't fully ripe. The chicken at the buffet was mushy.....how do you get mushy chicken? We paid for a table for 4. When it was time to bring out the champagne, the staff tried to only give us 1 bottle, instead of the 2 we paid for. When we asked for the 2nd bottle, they brought out a bottle of Andre's. Really? I could have spend the $10 at the store and bought that myself. The couple at the next table complained about the service as well - they were only brought 1 bottle and paid for 2. This was no where near worth the $170 that we paid and will never come back. The only good thing about the place....the upper level bartenders were polite and had good customer service."}
{"text":"First time going and I was quite impressed. The staff were very friendly. They had 3 floors, not too crazy about live music, so I stayed on the floor with the DJ. Haven't enjoyed myself like this in a bar in a long time. Will be going back"}
{"text":"Four because the service was a little slow. I came for Wednesday evening/night jazz. The band, flight 407, was FANTASTIC!!!  My salad was very good. The DJ WAS GREAT!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 6 stars for the drinks, food,  atmosphere and the sax!!!

Here in Phoenix for work and I wish I would have found out about this hidden jewel months ago! The band Flight 407 is outstanding and the gentleman playing the sax....... Woooooo.....I'd follow that sax around the world!"}
{"text":"If you were a patron of the last version of Michael's on 7th Ave and hoped their reinvention would be better, you are doomed to be disappointed.

First and foremost, the music is still abysmal. Specifically with regard to their upstairs room which seems to be intended more for dancing since the downstairs has no actual dance floor. 

When I come to a \"club\" environment, I expect to hear CURRENT music- Drake, Beyonce, Rihanna, DJ Khaled, etc.. Well, not on Michael's watch will recent music be played! The DJ apparently took a time machine back to 1998 and refuses to step into the present. Pretty much all they played the two times I've been here is Jaheim, Next, and other late 90's \"smooth R&B\" that is better suited for falling asleep to than dancing to. I honestly can't believe they insist on continuing to operate this way. The old location was the exact same way. It's sad really.

The music they play downstairs is even older- we're talking Evelyn Champagne King, Lakeside, THE WHISPERS! I felt like it was 1984 again and I was hanging in my grandma's basement.

Also, the demographic is all over the place, but mostly skews toward people well over 45. We are talking beyond \"grown & sexy\". Way beyond! I saw numerous elderly people there last week and this place is crawling with men in their 50's trying to play \"cat daddy\" to women in their 30's. 

It's gross.

Also, their bars (both upstairs and downstairs) are still woefully understaffed and you have to wait forever and a day at the bar for a drink. Just like the old location. Two bartenders at each bar for 150+ guests? Pitiful. And clearly they don't care!

Lastly, to be charging women a $10 cover on a Saturday night is pretty steep when most of your clientele is CREEPY OLD MEN. Michael's should be allowing women in here free of charge. Or maybe they should pay US to patronize this joke of an establishment. 

I honestly wouldn't balk at the cover if on my EVERY VISIT I didn't end up waiting far too long for a drink at the bar, not being able to dance to their boring, outdated music, and being leered at by men older than my dad all night.

I've been twice and I'm not enough of a glutton for punishment to make it a third. I'll hang at Blue Martini (on Sunday's), Bar Smith or literally ANYWHERE else that knows it's 2016, plays music from the 21st century, and attracts people born after 1960."}
{"text":"I had a great time at Michael's both times I went! I first went on a Thursday night and it was so fun! We sat down so it took longer to get orders but that was expected. The band and hospitality was great though. The second time I went was a Saturday night. It was fun but the atmosphere wasn't definitely dance club. Drinks are reasonable it's a fun place to go! I will most likely go back again!"}
