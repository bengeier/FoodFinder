{"text":"Based on others' reviews of this deli, I have been wanting to stop in and try it for a long time.  I could have saved the trip.  The first thing I noticed when I walked into the place was the smell.  Not sure if it was one of the food items, or if the place was just old and musty, but it was a complete turn-off.  I'm all for patronizing local businesses, I realize that I might be the only person to feel this way, and their food might be the most awesome stuff on this planet, but I lost my appetite really quickly and left.  As far as the rest of my experience went:  it's crowded, drab and not very tidy looking, they have communal seating (ick) that takes up most of the floor space, and it wasn't clear to a newcomer where I was supposed to go to place an order (was it at the cash register by the door, or back towards the deli?).  My brother-in-law's family owns a deli, and it looks and smells nothing like this one.  My mouth actually waters when I walk into theirs and smell their food...in Cheese 'n Stuff, my mouth watered like it does when you're about to throw up."}
{"text":"I worked on Central Ave for a number of years in the past and never saw this place.  And it's been there for 60 years!!!  I'm slackin' in my mom & pop shop dex duties!  

Had to run some errands in the area so I Yelped sandwich shops looking for one I had never been to before and came across this one.  I looked at their menu and immediately saw a bunch of items that appealed to me.  I still couldn't believe I had never seen this before, especially since I'm sooooo in love with Cheese!

The poor people behind the counter must have thought I was nuts!  I get the impression they are used to people knowing what they want when they walk in the door rather than having me stare at the menu for a good 10 minutes, again.  To my credit, the only lunch meat I ate growing up was a slice of bologna once a year and I've eaten the same Subway sandwich for 20 years so this whole deli thing is new to me.  I asked about a number of sandwiches and they were very helpful in answering all my questions.  \"You can have that hot or cold\".  \"Sourdough or rye\".

I settled on  a chicken salad sandwich, surprisingly.  I usually shy away from \"salad\" sandwiches because most places use too much mayo, or there's funky ingredients like walnuts or raisins or grapes.  I was feeling mighty brave today I guess.  The sandwich was AWESOME!  Great flavor and not drowning in goo.  They have a huge selection of chips or you can try their homemade potato or macaroni salad.  

I can't wait to bring the hubby back for him to try."}
{"text":"Stan and his kids are really friendly, and The Doughboy is a great brown-bag sandwich.  This place is part of my Central/Camelback routine, right between getting my haircut at Central Barbershop and heading over to All About Books & Comics or AJ's.  

Price:  Good
Atmosphere: Okay, don't really go there for the place
Service: Great
Food: Great

Only problem, they run out of Yoo-Hoo's half the time."}
{"text":"I came here while visiting, and I must say, this is a charming, well-priced, boars head meat-stocked place to have lunch.  Patrons ranged from nearby office workers to teenagers.  

I ordered up a Doughboy on sourdough based on a recommendation and was slightly disappointed.  The amount of meat and cheese they topped it with were inadequate, and their inability to offer real avocado on their sandwiches (instead of the pathetic spread they use instead) was rather disheartening. That being said, the macaroni salad was decent, but nothing special.  At least my chips and drink turned out how I had hoped for.

All in all, I appreciate the spirit and friendliness of the lovely people who own and operate Cheese 'n Stuff and what they try to do.  However, I would not come back here for anything other than to say 'Hi'."}
{"text":"This place is strange. There really isn't any other way to describe it... It's like a tiny little store (that only sells strange Norwegian candies and cookies) with a deli attached to it. It has folding tables in the center of it that are connected to one another so you can make a new friend at lunch (I guess), or have the staff stare at you while you eat (they didn't do that, but it still feels odd to eat there). The whole place is very small, and the deli area is wallpapered with sloppy white sheets of paper advertising different lunch options.

Let it be known, the food was very good. BUT, the place looks kind of dirty, and desperately needs someone to come in and make sense of it. The only issue that I took with the food was that they microwaved my hot sub. It was good, but I feel like microwaves belong at home. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"I lived in the neighborhood for a good year before trying this place. Shame on me! This is mom and pop at it's finest. Great portions of high quality meat and yummy breads. Price is such a good deal for what you get and it's always super fast service. My man and I usually split one sandwich and side and are happy full when done. I love the selection of Boar's Head meats as well as I can't find them at the Fry's down the street."}
{"text":"This is my favorite deli in the valley.  Whenever I am in central Phoenix I work my schedule around making sure that I get to eat here.  They remember my name and ask about how my family is doing even when it's been months since my last visit.  The fact that you can see pictures of generations of family working behind the counter in one place really should mean something when trying to figure out why you should eat here instead of subway or some other massive chain.  I always get the new yorker.  This is the place everyone craves in their community for lunch and it exists!"}
{"text":"This looked like it was going to be a great old school place. Unfortunately it's just old and run down. The sandwiches were a major disappointment. Nice selection of soda.  Go across the street to Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Pro:  selection, quality, service, value

Con: tight on parking

1 of 2 of my 5 star yelp selection thus far.  Family run with great hustle and class.  It's a joint that never disappoints.   Doughboy, do it.  Hard to go wrong here and I've tried all of the sandwiches.  Very good value.   Call ahead or prepare for a wait.  Tight on seating.  I prefer it during off hours to avoid the masses.  Skip the national chains and try this place if you're not yet hooked."}
{"text":"I lived on the East Coast (Rhode Island) for about 20 years and this place reminds me of the very best mom and pop deli's that seemed to be on every other corner. Wonderful good solid sandwiches and sides. What you see is what you get. Great quality, good service and that old school vibe. I hope you're around for another 50 years!"}
{"text":"Remember the Cheers theme song \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name\" ????
Making your way in the world today
Takes everything you got
Taking a break from all your worries
Sure would help a lot

This is THE ONLY place I go in Phoenix and they remember my name and ask about my husband by name. Now, THAT is impressive!

Stan is a wonderful guy and runs a fabulous business! We have ordered many platters for business events and they have been done perfectly and on time EVERY SINGLE TIME! It's hard to find anyone that consistently good.

The meat is fabulous, the sandwiches outstanding and the prices are wonderful. For instance, the cheesecake is $1.69. I told Stan he could double that price and no one would flinch about paying more. He said, he makes a profit at $1.69 and he is happy with that. WOW!

I can't rave enough about this place! Try it, you will love it!!"}
{"text":"Forget your chains! Cheese and Stuff is the real deal! They've got the best sandwiches in town and Stan is a master craftsman! The Lebanon bologna sandwich is to die for, as is the Bismark. They've got a lot of real great choices and whenever I'm in downtown PHX, this is my go-to joint!"}
{"text":"Yum!  I am so glad I stopped by today to try this place out.   I was craving a really good, yet simple sandwich today.  As I was driving up Camelback, I remembered how I have passed this place over a thousand times growing up, and it's still there(that has to be a good sign).   When I pulled up I was a little intimidated to go inside because I wanted to eat my food there,  and it looked like there wouldn't be anywhere to sit inside.  But a quick check on Yelp and I discovered they do have seating inside, and someone's review led me to order the Doughboy.  Simple yet AMAZING!  The bread and meat are to die for, so the mayo, bacon, and cheese all warmed up together just hit the spot.  Its one of those meals that you think you can make at home, but for some reason it is just so darn good made by someone else.  Well Cheese and Stuff, you can make my sandwich anytime!   I will be back again and again and again.

*Quick service too.  Got in, ordered, and ate within 12 min."}
{"text":"I recently met with a client here for lunch on his suggestion. When I arrived I was surprised...the decor/seating area leaves something to be desired. 

However, the FOOD was awesome! I had the Doughboy, which is their \"most popular\" sandwich and I know why. It was excellent and I highly recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"I just started working in the central phoenix area, and have to say that Cheese n stuff quickly became my favorite lunch stop around.   They use boar's head meats/cheese on their sandwiches and other quality ingredients in their sides.  The shop is small and quirky, and it's probably best as a carry-out location (they do have some tables inside, and although I've never seen all seats filled, I suppose that's a possibility). 
 
Its reasonably priced, with a gigantic menu and selection.  Their breakfast sandwich is delicious, as is everything I've had for lunch.  In fact, on more than one occasion where I have gone for breakfast and lunch in the same day.

If you like sandwiches, and miss east coast deli's, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Wild turkey is the way to go! They make it with good portions of brie and a TON of turkey. Very generous.

Also I just discovered some hidden Norwegian treasures-- they sell lefse and lutefisk. Haven't tried either yet, but it's not often you find this stuff!"}
{"text":"I must have driven past this place a hundred times before finally giving them a shot. So glad I did. Plenty of sandwiches and the usual suspects of sides and everything is so fresh and tasty. I don't know if I will ever go to a chain sandwich place again because despite being so good they are roughly the same price!  
If you are like me and have been by but never stopped in I'd highly recommend that you stop in. One piece of advice would be to review the menu online first, it can be a little overwhelming to decide from the options as they are displayed all over the deli case.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"As if this restaurant needs my review... 
Beyond delicious sandwiches made any way you like them. Boars head meats, widest selection of meat, cheese and toppings combinations in the entire city of Phoenix. Over 1 million sandwiches served. Friendliest family owned staff and the patrons were just as amazing. The only place I will go for a sandwich now. Whatever sandwich you can imagine... they have it. Must visit."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are my thing.  I want to eat as many of them as possible from as many different places as I can.  And let me tell you, there is just something about the sandwiches from Cheese 'n Stuff.

It's not big on atmosphere.  There's a deli counter and then a few picnic tables with plastic tableclothes, some shelves stocking Swedish foodstuffs for sale as well as the store's backstock of chips, soda and paper towels.  They usually have some cheesy holiday decorations out.  It's cramped and not that pleasant.  I usually get my lunches to go.

Their sandwich menu consists of about a million pages printed out from an inkjet printer and taped to the wall, along with some hokey signs that say things like \"Today's Special: So's Tomorrow.\"  There's nothing slick or pretentious about it.  It's obviously just a shop owned by some guy and his wife and daughter.

So yeah.  The sandwiches.  I'm a vegetarian, and they have a simple yet elegant veggie sandwich that I find myself craving a lot.  It has cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, avocados, and some kind of dressing.  I get it on a wheat sub roll.  Not fancy, but oh-so-tasty.  I wish they had more veggie options, but this one satisfies me.

I bring friends who eat meat here so I can tell them to order the Doughboy and enjoy it vicariously.  Their deli meat is high quality and there are loads of options.  It looks like the sort of place my grandpa would love and I want to bring him there some day.  No one I've brought in has been disappointed.

The sides are delicious.  I am a fan of the macaroni salad and the pasta salad that has the olives and italian dressing.  If I'm feeling indulgent, I'll get a brownie, a piece of cheesecake, or an ice-cold sarsaparilla.

The lack of atmosphere doesn't bother me; my one gripe with this place is how early they close.  There have been many times I haven't gotten moving early enough and haven't been able to get there before they close, which is 4 PM.  Those times I do get my rear in gear and errands all finished before 4, I do love to treat myself to Cheese 'n Stuff.  I highly suggest you try it."}
{"text":"Phoenix needs more great mom & pop's like this place!

Great food, a gazillion choices of sandwiches and the like (I suggest looking at their web page and narrowing down your choice before going in)  Reasonable prices, big portions, and a laid back atmosphere makes this place a winner!  It was an awesome place to grab a quick bite before hopping on the light rail to catch a game."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype. My sandwich was okay, at best. I'm being very generous with two stars. Why? With all of the diseases transmitted through food contact, eg. Hepatitis A, how do restaurants survive when their employees do not wear gloves when handing 'ready to eat' food?  Back in the 80s even 90s it wasn't a big deal. But today, it's huge. For that reason alone, I will not be back - ever."}
{"text":"I walked in as a skeptic and came out a believer! How great could a sammie be? According to the other reviews, THAT great so I had to try. 

I ordered thr Veggie sandwich and it was prob the best I ever had. I was shocked. The bread was so light, airey, doughy, and fresh all in one! The veggies were the basic as on any veg sammie but the ranch dressing made the landslide diference. 

I would give it 5 stars just on food but I took one off due to the cramped space. Two of the tables were full of patrons and with 3 other people in line space was very limited, to the point of being akward. 

Overall, great place and I will go back again!"}
{"text":"I just re-visited Cheese 'N Stuff this weekend after a while.  I guess just eat during their limited hours very often.  They close very early (4pm).

I love their liverwurst sandwiches and the Bismark but this time I decided to try the Doughboy people speak of minus mayo as I do not enjoy warm sandwich lubrication.  As ever the place is tiny, homey and spotlessly clean.  I had some of the hot German Potato salad as a side and a ginger ale.   All were yummy, delicious and satisfying! 

 As I was eating I had a yen for a Celery Soda to go with this classic sandwich but I've only been able to get them at Chompie's in the valley.  There are loads of interesting European cookies to get packages of as dessert so grab a couple of friends when you go but carpool as the lot is smallish.  I guess they stopped giving pickles with sandwiches, bummer."}
{"text":"I have been going to this tucked away sandwich shop on Central and Camelback for the past 20 years. There are very few quality deli's in Phoenix and this is atop the list. This owner operated, non chain deli is proof that not all hope is lost when searching for a quality sandwich shop in the valley. There is nothing fancy about this place, it is really too small to eat at the restaurant so my orders are primarily, to go...When you ask around the Phoenix area for a good sandwich shop, you most likely will hear of crappy chain deli's like Capriotties, Jason's Deli, someone may even throw out Duck and Decanter if they are trying to impress you (even though any true foodie knows \"the duck\" was a top place for a sandwich....back in 2001....anyways, most people have not heard of Cheese N Stuff, I suggest making your way in there for a real sandy."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! I've been eating here for over a decade now and it NEVER fails me. Consistant, friendly, and incredible food! Everything from the breakfast bagel, to the chicken salad sandwich, to the potato salad. If I lived closer, i'd eat here twice a week."}
{"text":"I went to this  deli? for lunch,it was a step above subway  i asked for oil and vin   on my italian special,it tasted like frys  salad dressing  was not that impressed with the  place i guess they have there regulars that swear by it and i hate subway by the way     try DeFalcos deli in scotts dale"}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here after reading the reviews.  
I did not have the same excitement when I left.  
Food was good.  Quality ingredients.  Friendly service.  Fun atmosphere.  But the volume/portion of food was not equal to the price paid.  If you are on a high carb diet or like more bread than meat/cheese, this is the place for you.
Doubling the meat/cheese might have helped, but the price for that would have bumped well into a $$ rating."}
{"text":"what is not to love. old school deli, unique grocery items and awesome people! Stan and Crystal are great and they have our order memorized. The Bizmark on Rye no cheese (stupid lactose intolerance) is amazing. Try to eat it at least once a week. my wife has been eating the #5 since she was a little girl!"}
{"text":"No frills. Just good sandwiches. Nice people but they really should wear gloves preparing food!"}
{"text":"People that know Phoenix know this place.  I will drive out of my way to go here when I'm in town.  I will tip extra.  If I see someone in line being difficult I will stare them down, the family that works here could give kindness lessons.

Exactly what one hopes for in a family run deli/sandwich shop.  Half of Phoenix grew up on this place including myself.  

\"GOLD, Jerry!...GOLD!\""}
{"text":"My favorite favorite favorite place. Possibly ever. 

When I was in highschool my loitering teenybopper friends and I used to get kicked out of here on a regular basis, but I don't hold that against them. We were idiots.

cNstuff has been around forever and is owned by the nicest family on the planet. The minute I walk in there the smell of cheese (or is it sandwiches?) makes me instantly hungry. And there is lots of cheese. 

The sandwich menu is extensive and I always have the hardest time deciding what to order. It seems like there is a new sandwich added everyday. Do I want the Doe Boy or just a plain ol' Tuna? Russian dressing or mustard? Sub roll or wheat? For extra you can get a side of chips, potato or macaroni salad (which is a little too sweet for me). There is also a plethora of little extra snacks to fill up on, candy bars, twinkies you name it. Last time in there, there was noticeably less Swedish products on the shelves which was a little sad. Maybe they weren't selling very well? They were always enjoyable to look at. 

Anyway, please stop in to this delightful little sandwich shop, you won't be disappointed.

Edited to add: German products, not Swedish. They were Umlaut-laden names so I got confused."}
{"text":"I love cheese'n stuff. Any sandwich I've had here has been really good. You get treated like family here. Many sandwiches to choose from but my favorite is the dough boy. You can get a sandwich made to order as well. They also have a nice selection of meats and cheeses that can be purchased by the lb"}
{"text":"Walking into Cheese 'n Stuff is like a blast from the past. A simple deli counter with no frills. Boar's Head meats and cheeses are available and the ingredients are pretty decent. I used to frequent this place back when I worked at the comic book store a block away, and I remember the nicest father-son duo working here. Preparing tasty sandwiches at very reasonable prices. I'd choose this place over a Quizno's or Subway ANY DAY. I particularly loved that I could get delicious sandwiches made-to-order to go along with a bag of chips, one of their giant chocolate chip cookies, and a bottle of one of their craft bottled sodas. Space is quite limited, so brown bag your lunch and take it elsewhere. They've got a few prepared foods, salads, and pantry items for sale as well. Locally owned and operated, slightly kitschy, but definitely recommended for a reasonable and quick uptown lunch."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  About a milion times better than just going to subway.  I have been wanting to try this sandwich shop since I was in highschool, and never did until the other day when my husband asked to try something new for a change, and all I ever want are sandwiches.  

The bread is so soft, there are so many meats and so many options that sound delicious, and best of all, I walk out of there actually spending less than I do at subway.

Definately worth a try if you like deli sandwiches on the go."}
{"text":"I'm very glad my boyfriend and I stopped by for lunch. It was definitely stepping back in time, sitting down and eating a delicious sub. The price is right on the money for all the yummy gooey cheese meatfilled sammies. They also have some old classic sodas like Dr. Brown's and Christmas Soda, something I've never tried before today. Christmas Soda is great not too much sugar syrup like regular soda. Highly recommend and it's best when you put the technology down and enjoy."}
{"text":"4.4/5 Very good. I usually get the Turkey Rueben and I am never disappointed. Fast friendly service, dining area a little tight but who cares. Portions are right on for the quality you get. This isn't a subway, this is a real deli."}
{"text":"Simply an AWESOME tuna sandwich! Great service, and the atmosphere was really cool. Just wondering what the difference is between pickles and cucumbers in brine. (50 cents, apparently)"}
{"text":"Hands down, this place has the BEST sandwiches in AZ!

1. Great Bread
2. Generous size portion of meat in each sandwich.
3. Nice variety of sandwiches.

Wild Turkey is my personal favorite sandwich.
Brie/ Boar's Head Turkey/ Lettuce/ Tomato on Sourdough Bread."}
{"text":"This is the OLD SCHOOL Deli of Phoenix.  My family has been going here since it has opened, my grandmother, my father, everyone.  We always ordered Beer Wurst Sandwitches with their famous Cheese Spread.  Try A dough boy, Try their Macaroni Salad.  You can't go wrong.  Yes, you do have to know what you want when you come in, this ain't friggin Subway, its a real DELI..."}
{"text":"Really couldn't find anything special about the sandwiches here. Boars Head meat is always good, but I'm not sure if they are actually slicing the meat for each sandwich. Turkey seemed like it was cut another time, wrapped up in some plastic and then unfolded for each person's sandwich. They also doused the entire thing with about a quart of Russian Dressing (#5), put some fancy tomatoes on the sandwich and I requested a change of cheese from baby swiss to Smoked cheddar. You can only get about 8 different cheeses here on your sandwich (the rest you must buy) and they only carry one style of Boars Head turkey. No pepper or pastrami style, nothing but boring old plain turkey. Whoever is raving about the macaroni salad must be a rookie as well. The mac salad lacked any flavor and resembled ones you will find in a supermarket tub. There might be some better sandwich combinations out there on their extremly cluttered back wall (it's actually not cute cause your menu is in 20 places), but with the limited variety of meats, it doesn't mean much. Yeah, it's been there awhile, but so what, McDonald's has been around awhile too."}
{"text":"Very cool authentic Phoenix location with create sandwiches. Small place and can get crowded but worth it."}
{"text":"An all time Phoenix classic!

When you pull up to the shop, you can sense the history right away.  Incredible sign out front!  Inside, the place is well worn in the best sense- it's lived in, in a welcoming, awesome way.  People sometimes say Phoenix is still a small town- this is definitely a small town place with lots of regulars.  Plenty of little signs that this place has been selling sandwiches for sixty-odd years, and I love it!

Great variety of delicious sandwiches and good combos.  Each time I've been, I've loved everything I've gotten.  The macaroni salad isn't over hyped... it's really that good.

The family that runs this place is awesome, too.

In Phoenix, so much of our history has been plastered over... too much is lost in the stucco and cheap tile and \"championship golf\" and \"planned community\" boredom.  The history and heritage is there when you look for it, though, and this place is part of it.  This is a Phoenix treat and if you haven't been here yet, you are completely missing out!"}
{"text":"\"Is it local? I am just going to ask you one more time, and its local?

If your a central corridor native like myself you have either heard of this place or eating here. I always passed and heard about this place but never took the time to try it out. I would recommend taking the time!

Next to the DQ, Cheese n Stuff is a local and family as you can get. Picture os the last six decades are taped, tacked, and hanging from all places of the store.

When I order my Hot Pastrami on Rye ($5.75) with the $1.29 combo (chips and soda can) I was hoping for the best. The result was a standard sliced bread with 1/4in thick of meat and cheddar cheese.  ehhh was not that impressed. Next time I will try one of there specialty sandwich.

5stars for the [*****]service and keeping the vintage decor!

NOTE: Parking is sparse. Park across the street near the Applebees."}

{"text":"Cheese and stuff might be the.cutest little sandwich place on the planet."}

{"text":"If you love a classic feel sandwich shop, a family-owned operation in a sea of commercial chains and some of the best dang sandwiches in town then look no further than Cheese N Stuff. I love it. This place is an institution in Phoenix with great prices and a lot of love that goes into their sandos. I love the doughboy and the tuna, and I can tell the family behind the counter really cares about the community it serves. And come on, you can't go wrong with an old school deli serving Boar's Head meats and cheeses. It's a slice of paradise serving since 1949 and it deserves your dollar and business."}
{"text":"Y-U-M! I can't wait to go back to this little gem. Try the \"Tyler\" it was delicious. They have so many menu options, I'm going to have to make several trips back to try everything. The shop itself is very small, quaint, clean and family owned. The owner was kind and helpful, I can't wait to go back."}

{"text":"The people here are really nice it was my first time. I think its a family that owns It. The bread is really good and my daughter loved her salami and pepperoni hero And I enjoyed my veggie sub. Good local spot!"}
{"text":"There is a lot of hype for this pretty average sandwich joint. My co-workers and I heard about this place through a listing of 20 great American Sandwich shops and it apparently even had an Oprah mention. After seeing these glowing reviews here as well I was pretty much certain that I would be let down in some way, but its hard to even imagine the reason for the hype this place achieved.

It is an extremely tiny shop stuck at the end of the strip mall with central music. It's so tiny I've parked in front of it before and haven't even noticed it. The inside looks to have been renovated circa 1982 with faux wood paneling and shelving, and vintage boar's head advertisements that have been left to rot. The menu spread out across the entire wall on a confusing mix of chalk boards and computer print outs. The eating space is an extremely claustrophobic setup of folding tables and chairs stuck between the deli counter and the half-assed market shelves that sported international items that were mostly covered with a thick layer of dust.

The actual sandwiches, solid quality deli stuff using primarily boar's head meats and cheeses. That's it? Why would you fall in love with this place? I went with five other guys who ordered a mix of their signature sandwiches (Doughboy, Bizmark, Manhattan), and all agreed you can get a similar sandwich at grocery stores and preferred even the likes of Sack's to this place. There is just nothing inventive about the sandwiches or anything that stands out here other then the friendly Mom and Pop ownership and sweet vintage sign."}
{"text":"Change your name. I went to cheese 'n stuff to buy cheese and the choices were laughable. It's not even a cheese shop. If your interested in purchasing cheese go to Duck & Decanter, Wedge and Bottle, or AJ's."}
{"text":"Felt like I was home in NJ/NY at a deli, good food nice people."}
{"text":"Dough boy...dough boy...dough boy...
Cheese n stuff may have a large menu with something for nearly everyone but I just can't walk in there and not order my Dough Boy. Top it off with macaroni salad and an iced tea and I'm all set.

On top of being mildly obsessed with that amazing sandwich, there's much to love in their little space. The friendly family that runs the place is always smiling and happy to see you and welcome all guests... high schoolers on their skateboards, businessmen in their Mercedes, white collar guys in their beat-up pickups...they all are mingling in that little deli. I've yet to go there, and I've been probably 20 times, and not have the owners know at least one guest by name when they walk in.

This was orignally a meat and cheese shop back in the day, hence the name, and they still have some deli products to pick up if you feel like skipping Safeway's. 

It's an old-school, quiet place. It's always nice to dine-in and enjoy the quiet atmosphere and feel like you're not in the big city for a short time. It may be hard to spot the store in that little strip mall, so just look for the Dairy Queen...it's right next to it."}

Great vintage, simple, down to earth mom and pop! 
Great bread! Great beef and ham!"}
{"text":"I feel good eating here.  It's good food (Boar's Head meats are my favorite brand), family-owned, and it's classic.  I like the Doughboy with a Sasparilla.       It's a tradition for me, and they make me smile every time.  Good food, the best service around and just being in there you can feel the love and tradition of a family owned and operated business."}
{"text":"Classic North Central Deli!!!
One of the best in town.  Slower service but worth the wait.  A must for Uptown locals!"}
{"text":"I just checked this place out after telling myself that I would try it for the past 4 years.  I finally went, and I really liked it.  Had the \"doughboy\" on a sub roll, and it was really good.  There are plenty of other specialty sandwiches to try, as well as just plain sandwiches.

For the price (sandwiches range from $5.25-$9.95), this place is great.  I can't believe the joint has been around for 60 years!  

Don't think elegant dining if you plan to eat here.  The inside is just some tables with tablecloths and very limited seating (almost picnic table style)."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed my experience at Cheese 'n Stuff.

My first visit to Phoenix, on the road with my band, I decided to explore downtown. I had a hankering for a sandwich, so I summoned the iPhone and searched Yelp! for \"sandwich\" and Cheese 'n Stuff was a mere .2 miles from where I was standing (across the street).

The service was very friendly and attentive and the sandwich was by leaps and bounds the best sandwich I've yet to feast on...

I will be returning!"}
{"text":"This Delicatessen (Cheese N Stuff) is Awesome!!!!  Great food, the owner is from New York~*.  

The customer service is great, like it originally was years & years ago which you rarely find now theses days, it has that back in the day NY east-coat vibe even down to how the store is represented, they also sell many items you hardly see anymore Yay!  Like these cookies*


I ordered a Turkey & Cheese / w Provolone, Boar's Head Sub, uuuh the best & not to mention the bread OMG...!!! Super soft & delicious. Yummy, this store definitely gets 2 thumbs up .  I will be returning again."}
{"text":"This is as local-business as it gets - this deli has been around for decades. For Phoenix, that's like a millenium. I've been to Cheese and Stuff for lunch about 8 times in the past year, and I've always had a delicious sandwich. They have a huge menu and I'm sure if you want something that's not listed, they'll make it for you. I can't remember the owners' names, but they are always friendly and happy to see you. The dining room does leave a bit to be desired so plan to take your sandwich to go - the only suggestion I'd make for cheese and stuff is perhaps tout yourself as to-go only, lose the tables altogether and make a little more room for unique German gifts and such. Perhaps add a delivery service instead? Okay, now I'm dreaming.

PS in the summer time you can get a fresh squeezed 32 ounce lemonade for a dollar. It is FANTASTIC.  And the iced tea is delicious and always fresh."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a kid, but I can assure you that nostalgia is not painting my review. This family owned deli knows how to make a sandwich, and there's enough on the menu to make anyone happy. They may be straightforward and simple, but the quality shines through. Even though I don't live in Phoenix anymore, it isn't a visit home until I have a Cheese n Stuff sandwich. 

On top of it all is the service. I haven't come regularly enough for Stan, the owner, to remember my order, but there's always a spark of recognition in his smile. They'll treat you like a regular on your first visit, and will know your order by heart when you really become one. 

If I had to give you a recommendation, I would say start with the doughboy. Just writing this review has me wanting one. The avocado and mayo melting together over the crispy bacon and turkey... excuse me while I go order one."}
{"text":"Wonderful food in this historic, family owned deli. We (the wife and I) love going there for lunch on random Saturday afternoons. There is no other place in Phoenix like it and the menu will show it, most of thier food is from europe and fresher than any AJ's. It's been here for over 60 years and run by the same family. My favorite sandwiches are the Bismark or the Haturo, you cannot go wrong eating here!"}
{"text":"If you cut me, I'll bleed havarti and brie cheese, that's how much I love the stuff!  I stopped by Cheese 'n Stuff to find some nice wedges for a cheese plate.  The father daughter duo working the counter were seasoned pro's at working long line that forms around lunchtime.  I also ordered a sandwich for lunch and it was packed with meat and cheese, the bread was soft and doughy like all subs should have.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really into this spot. Reminds me of a classic NYC deli. Sandwiches are tasty and the space is cozy.  The service is really friendly.. I recommend the tall lean Texan."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Cheese 'n Stuff. I had the Texan and my boyfriend had the Sicilian with double meat and double cheese.  Both Sandwiches were ample in size and more than enough for any human being. His Sicilian was monstrous. Everything tasted fresh and was FAR better than any sandwich you could get at a chain sub shop. 

We also had the house-made lemonade (delicious) and both the German potato salad and traditional American Potato salad. I wouldn't buy any of these bound salads again. The German Potato Salad tasted like warmed, thin cut red potatoes in pre-made, store bought Italian dressing. Oh and it also contained bacon bits and was very vinegary and very sweet.  The American potato salad tasted EXACTLY like the Resers  potato salad you get in your local grocer's deli or amongst the other pre-made salads. Although it did seem they mixed it with extra yellow mustard. Same tangy miracle-whippy taste - same weird texture oddly toothsome potatoes. And little bits of red bell pepper. The macaroni salad also looked the same.

They did have an interesting assortment of sodas (celery soda,anyone?) along with the usual suspects.  And if you need a meat or cheese plate or both- they do that too!

This place is the quintessential mom and pop shop. Its great. Locally owned by a family who has had it for about 63 years. 

We shall return!"}
{"text":"These guys are great!  My wife called in to order a deli tray for a party.  We had no idea how much food we needed for the number of guest.  They helped us figure everything out and let us place the order over the phone.  I picked the deli tray up the day of the party.  When I arrived everything was ready to go.  The meats and cheese were nicely laid out on the platter as were the lettuce and tomato.  

Great food and great family service !  We'll be back for our next party!

Thanks!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is, I really hope this place was having a bad day. I was really hoping this place would be good. I loved their sign out front and was hoping for a new place to go...but I guess not.

When you first walk in, there is no real clear direction as to where you go to order. I walked up to where they were making sandwiches for another customer and stood there. There were two people behind the counter making sandwiches. One left to ring a customer up and came back. All along, for the 5 minutes I was standing there, nobody said \"we'll be right with you\", \"Hello\", nothing. I didn't even get eye contact, but I suppose that would have meant they would have had to say something.

I finally got an \"Are you ready?\", which as a side note I thought was somewhat rude. You can't even give me a \"Hello. How may I help you?\" Just an \"Are you ready?\" as if I had been making him wait a long time before making my decision. No... I was waiting on you. But I digress. I ordered and decided to get my sandwich to go because the environment wasn't much to look at and it felt claustrophobic.

The food meh and made with what seemed like bagged bread. You can look at my photos to see what I got. I think they speak for themselves."}
{"text":"Delicious lovely family owned sandwich shop. Boar's Head meats, fresh bread, and friendly people. I work around the corner. . I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch prior to my eye appointment and after a long day at work. (I start work at 4:45am and I am usually off by 12:00pm).
We ordered the Italian sub and split it with a side of potato salad and two drinks: ice tea and Pepsi.
The owners and their daughter are very friendly and welcoming to everyone that walks through the door.
The sub was loaded with Boars Head meats and cheese. The bread was very fresh and baked that morning. The veggies were fresh and tasted as if they came out of the garden that day. It was the freshest sub we have ever eaten.
This is without a doubt one of the best delis in Phoenix. It's small and quaint. They have a huge selection of sandwiches both hot and cold. This is a rare find for those who seek a nice, tucked away deli with delicious food.
We will definitely return."}
{"text":"A nice little shop, not too busy, that sells Leftza, when in stock. The Blazer I had was good, nice bread with Boar's head Buffaloed chicken.  Yes, you could make it yourself if you want to,but this is quick, no mess place, family run."}
{"text":"Dam I wish I would have known this place was here sooner. Really good sandwiches. They use Boars Head meat which I am a huge fan of. They have so many different sandwiches it took me a while to figure out what I wanted. The menu is kinda all over the place. There is a menu board but its old and fadeed but they have white papers with all the sandwiches hung up all over the wall. The staff  are very friendly and I'm sure this place has many regulars. Inside its a tight squeeze with limited seating. The macaroni salad is great as is the potatoe salad. I love the sicilian sub. The italian dressing on it is so really good and I think thats why I like this sub so much. My other fav is the club on wheat. Oh yeah I think Ill go there agin today. Sanwhiches range from $5.95-6.95."}
{"text":"i love this place so much for the down home new york city corner look of it. it seriously looks like they picked this place up from manhattan and delivered it to phoenix.

yes, it's small and a little cramped inside. get it to go and let me gawk at all the amazing products lined up across their shelves. so many rare types of strange delicacies i can't believe it. lutefisk! i haven't tried it but i'm going to give it a go next time i'm in there.

although the place may look like a total bummer inside with it's computer-paper-print outs hanging all over the wall listing their food, you can't really deny the cheesiness (oh puns) of this place. they're very friendly inside and recommended i try the corned beef sandwich with melted swiss and mustard. the bread was so soft it nearly melted in my mouth and the corned beef was top notch and not extremely fatty. it was a perfect size as well, not too big and meaty but not too scrawny. packed a lotta punch. they use boars head meats, and you can't really go wrong there.

prices are very reasonable too, you can get out of their unscathed for a mere ten bucks. it's community seating inside so be prepared to go cozy."}
{"text":"I don't normally opt for sandwiches, being gluten-intolerant and all, but this place makes such yummy sandwiches that I find myself craving it. Even worse, it's walking distance to my house... Here come the cramps! It is so worth it though... Turkey and Brie, Doughboy, you name it...

Also, they have great German side dishes. When I am too lazy to cook (more often than not) and I am required to bring side dishes to Mom's home (the full-German Grandma), this is where I head. Warm German Potato Salad.... delectable!"}
{"text":"My favorite part of cNs is actually the brownies. The brownies are amazing. Fudgy, gooey, topped with a few nuts. I'd go back for the brownies absolutely any day. Otherwise, it is a solid place to go and get a sandwich if you don't feel like making one. I had a BLT, and wish it had a little bit more lettuce. I plan on going again and trying something a little more adventurous next time.

The atmosphere was very earnest--I felt like I walked into the 70s or 80s. Wood panel walls, two picnic tables for seating inside, and shelves for storage make it seem like a very warm mom-and-pop place.

Parking, however, can be a bit of a nightmare. Either park behind the building (near Francis, Golden Rule and Stinkweed's parking lot) or prepare to fight for a spot in front of it."}
{"text":"Cute little family owned sandwich shop in uptown. 
Great meats and (duh) cheeses. 
Good selection of specialty sandwiches, with printed descriptions randomly taped all over the walls. 
Typical of this kind of place, it's a little slow and prices are higher. 
Great location, I'm putting it on my regular rotation."}
{"text":"Had a great sandwich here the other week. Got The Doughboy which is turkey, bacon, swiss, and avocado on sliced sourdough, warmed up, and I added a side of chips and a can of soda - just under $8. Also grabbed a slice of cheesecake for less than $2. Everything was really fresh and the service was fast and friendly despite it being busy. There's a reason why this place has been around so long! 
They also had a full menu of sliced meats and cheeses for those who prefer making their own sandwiches at home - plus shelves of imported products, seemingly mostly from Sweden. It was nice to see some things I haven't seen since I lived in Finland.

I can't wait to come back and try the Turkonberry or the Wild Turkey sandwiches. Both sound amazing!"}
{"text":"You can drive by this place forever and not know they have the best sandwiches in Phoenix!!  All of the ingredients are super fresh.  Biting in the bread is like biting into a little heaven cloud.  So soft and delicious it's almost not fair that other places have to compete.  I'm not a big fan of deli sides (potato salad, macaroni salad) but the ol lady says the macaroni salad is some of the best she's ever had.  The menu is a little hard to see as it is scattered but have no fear, if you don't find one you like, they'll make you one however you want it.  Family run and the owners are very nice."}
{"text":"Oh Cheese N' Stuff how I love thee! 

I didn't know of The Cheese until I started dating my now husband. He has been going here since he was a little boy. His whole family is obsessed with this place, to the point that not only does the owner know them by heart and knows what they order, but so does the owners kids! That's customer service! 

I usually get the tuna, its AMAZING but this past Saturday I went for the #5 which is the turkey sammich on a sub roll with Russian dressing! So yum! 


Also, I am wayyyyyy picky about my macaroni salad, and cNs's mac salad is the bomb nonnie! I promise! 

I topped off my lunch with a cream soda! 

Yes its old and cramped, but the sandwiches make up for all of that."}
{"text":"I can't help but order the Doughboy every time I'm at Cheese. Mmmm my fave! Yeah, they use an avocado spread rather than the real thing, but that's just the way it's made. It makes it all gooey and delicious. I like to add a sarsaparilla or iced tea, along with a tiny mac salad or potato salad side. It really doesn't get any better. (The Long Tall Texan is another family fave.)

The space is a blast from the past -- humble beginnings with personal family touches. The family owned and operated shop is clean and always welcoming. The clientele ranges from blue collared to white collared, high school kids to grandpas. You really can't get any local than this, people!

Every time I'm in the neighborhood, I have to stop in for lunch...or breakfast (tasty breakfast egg sandwiches). Cheese 'N Stuff is a real treat and never disappoints."}
{"text":"Seeing that this place has great reviews on Yelp, and with raving reviews from my co-workers, I decided to try out this place.

It's unfortunate that Schlotzkey's has the catchphrase \"Strange name, serious sandwich\", because Cheese N Stuff takes the cake.

I had the Manhattan, which was a take on the classic Ruben, and it was delicious!  The only thing though is that I would have loved my sandwihc on rye, not wheat.

This is the kind of place that just oozes good feelings, and the owner is more than helpful. 

I enjoyed my sandwich, and intend on going back, especially because they carry Lutefisk."}
{"text":"Hidden....small but great food.  Meatball sub is tasty.  Prices are reasonable.  Seating is limited as is parking.  But both are worth the wait to get into this little gem.  I did not try the desserts but they looked soooooooo good."}
{"text":"Shame on me for not having known about this wonderful little gem.  We tried to have lunch on a Monday and the place was packed.  Too bad we were in a hurry or we would have stayed.  So on friday I stopped in later in the afternoon.  The place was quiet and the young gal behind the counter was sweet and helpful.  I ordered a sandwich and german potato salad to go and am very pleased.  The sandwich was a good size, not to big and the potato salad was solid.  I love a small local business and they do not disappoint."}
{"text":"I think this deli has been around for 30 years or something close to that. The quality of the food is excellent. The service and the environment is different from what a lot of lunch goers are used to. This is a family owned and operated business and I think they do a great job. When I'm in the mood for a quality sandwich this is number one on my list."}
{"text":"I held true to my word and tried lunch here shortly after trying breakfast. I walked out with a texan to go and was completely happy and satisfied the rest of the day. And I came back the next weekend, and had the same thing again.

I still wish they had better hours so I could enjoy them some evening after work when I didn't feel like cooking, but no matter what the hours, when they combine their cheese with their stuff, it's a total win."}
{"text":"For a moment I was in Chicago.. awesome family owned & operated deli.. the old kind, where you pick your own meats, proteins, breads.. many of which come straight from Chicago including the tins of candy for $2.75 ea.. got the Italian sub, homemade carrot cake & tin of coffee candy all for around 10bucks!!
Awesome job Stan and Chrystal!!!"}
{"text":"I had a sandwich here today for lunch. I've been here a dozen times, I thought I should do a quick review. 

The cold cut sandwiches are good. Better than what you'd get at Subway. They use Boar's Head meats. But they don't use a ton of meat on the sandwiches, just an adequate amount. If you're really hungry, one sandwich might not fill you up. 

I like the breakfast sandwiches here the best. Toasted bagel or English muffin with an egg, cheese, and bacon, ham or sausage. But the side dishes like the potato salad are nothing special. They also have a variety of imported European grocery items. 

Warning to Yelp, I tried a slice of cheesecake once. It was NOT good. Watery instead of dense like it should be. I think it was past its ideal freshness date."}
{"text":"These guys know a thing or two about making stellar sandwiches. This is a local, family owned establishment and they've already served up over a million sandwiches.

I would eat here more often, but their hours are limited. 

First thing for a superb sandwich is bread. Bread is key, and their sourdough is soft perfection. Second is meat, and they use top quality Boar's Head meat.

I've also ordered half-sized sandwiches, which is also a plus.

They carry a number of special items in addition to standard fare, such as Poore Brothers chips, specialty sodas, and Swedish goodies."}
{"text":"Solid Mac salad and good pickles.  I had the Bizmark and it was on the dry and flavorless side.  It was also overpriced for the size of the sandwich.  More condiments would have been a plus as well.  Bummer as I was really looking forward to this place after reading over other reviews.  Another plus was the people: Very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"If you have signs everywhere about how if you're on your cell phone you won't get served, I expect it be the kind of delicious old school place I love. Unfortunately these people might need a cell phone to look up strategies for managing service better. I sat for 15 minutes waiting, my food never was called. Went to cashier who after looking, came out with a sandwich and said \"I must gave given someone the wrong one, is this other sandwich ok?\"

Uhh yeah sure. I'll take this random different sandwich that sat there for 10 minutes. And leave a rare yelp review. What a weird place. Looks the part, but not good enough to act like that.

Old school isn't always better."}
{"text":"Can't believe I've lived here two and a half decades and haven't been to Cheese 'n Stuff until now.  Excellent little sandwich shop; its simplistic goodness will take you back to yesteryear."}
{"text":"What a great, locally owned family business!

This place has been in business for over 60 years!  Now that's impressive.

Cheese 'n Stuff is my \"go to\" establishment for lunch during the week.

I always order The Haturo, which is ham, turkey, roast beef, provolone cheese, onion, lettuce and mayo, with Italian dressing on a sub roll.  I have them replace the tomatoes with peppercinis, which helps to give it a little kick.

Now that I think about it, a small dose of tabasco would probably be good, too.

I usually eat my sandwich with some Tim's jalapeno chips (which I have to buy at Safeway) and a side of pasta or potato salad.

Their salads are great and affordably priced.

I have been trying to replicate a sandwich that reminds me of home and this is the only place that has been able to meet my high expectations.

The family is extremely nice and very good at what they do.

Cheese n' Stuff is one of the best businesses in the Valley.  They deserve your patronage."}
{"text":"Very good sandwich shop for lunch! I had tracked Cheese 'n Stuff down but initially had to wait due to their lunch oriented hours. When we got a chance the other day to finally try their sandos out I was pretty happy. 

I am always a fan of Boar's Head products so C'nS is already headed in the right direction for me. The bread for my Italian Sub was a great fresh, soft roll which had nicely absorbed some of the dressing rounding out a nice sandwich. I have a task ahead working through their sandwich list but expect many great encounters along the way. 

Great family owned spot."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Phoenix, I've been going to Cheese n' Stuff since I was 10 years old... I'm normally a vegetarian, but I make exceptions for this place, it's that good!!

Super atmosphere, incredibly great service, and delicious food. The owners are absolutely wonderful, and it's been family owned and operated since opening. The girls who help run it are so nice and friendly, and it's wonderful to see a truly family owned local shop in Central Phoenix.

I absolutely love the turkey and cheese sandwich with a little mayo and tomato. Plain, but sooo good! Price is very reasonable, especially for the superb location. 

I've seen this place really crowded around lunch time during the week, but they are very efficient in getting your lunch to you quickly. 

Cheese n' Stuff also sells a variety of Scandinavian products, likes cookies and lutefisk (whatever that is) plus lots of other foreign foods I've never heard of. If you're looking for an obscure Scandinavian food, you might want to check out this place first.

In short, I love this place. Yummy food at great prices, an excellent location on Central & Camelback (near Dutch Bros!), and family owned. Yay!"}
{"text":"I have been enjoying Cheese 'n Stuff for 45 years.  Every sandwich is just delicious.  the cole slaw is incredible.  The bread selection and rolls are fresh every time.  I very good selection of Cold drinks.  Christmas cookies are lucky if they last a week at my house."}
{"text":"A mom and pop type of sandwich deli that has been around for many years.  You definitely won't get that chain feel like Subway, Quizno's, or Blimpie.  The owners are always so friendly and the prices are great.  Sandwiches are spectacular and I'm loving the location near Central Ave and Camelback, so much seems to be going on in this area. New restaurants and stores opening up all this time and I'm sure this place will be around for a while.  

I'm getting hungry just thinking about the place!"}
{"text":"Honestly didn't have high expectations for this place... Boy was I wrong. Extremely friendly atmosphere, great subs, and good selection of drinks, plus the macaroni salad was on point!"}
{"text":"I got the hot pastrami with Swiss, coleslaw,  and thousands island dressing. NOM, Nom, nom! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches! Stan and his family rock. The menu is not traditional and that is what make this place unique and better! I always get the Tyler but I've  had every sandwich and they all are delicious. Been coming here for 12 years. The place is an old deli and the feeling is very homey!! Give them a try! It's worth it. A Phoenix original!!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Place is always nice and clean. Not a corporate eatery. Seating arrangements might at first seem charming, but kinda suck if you appreciate a little personal space while you eat your lunch. 

Been a customer for many years and they still don't know my name -- or ever make any effort to ask. What's ironic is that the family stays safely hidden behind that \"Great Wall of China\" style deli case, while customers are expected to eat shoulder-to-shoulder at communal picnic tables with complete strangers. 

 I say TAKE DOWN THE WALL and make an effort to interact with your loyal customers/fans. Lots of us would really appreciate it. 

By the way, my name is Mike."}
{"text":"We had the Haturo and split it!  It was huge and delicious.  Soft roll and lots of meat.  I can imagine when they get busy it can be a little slow.  I'd come back again for sure."}
{"text":"I just stopped in and got the Manhattan special to go. It was piled high with Boars Head Pastrami served nice and hot. It was fantastic.

This place reminds me of the east coast mom and pop delis I grew up with. It has a huge selection of sandwiches and subs so there's definitely something for everybody. I'll go out of my way for a sandwich here. Definitely gonna be my regular spot for a quick delicious sandwich."}
{"text":"Really Great Place!  I discovered this place one day after walking out of AJ's across the where I bought a sandwich moments prior, when I saw this place with a big banner that read \"delicatessen\" I was immediately pissed that I didn't know it was there and bought a sandwich at AJ's, not that AJ's sandwiches are bad, but I crave a more authentic deli style sandwich.  Well they are very good, would give four stars but in Oakland at Genova delicatessen you get sandwiches so good that you are spoiled for life.  These, however, may be best in phoenix.  Owners are great, family run, very very kind people, authentic deli environment, awesome quality, good bread, who can ask for more?"}
{"text":"Not the easiest place to find and very small - best as a takeout sandwich shop - but THE best sandwiches. Reminds me of a Jewish deli in New York, soft rolls and bread are amazing. I've never bought their cheese but they sell it as well."}
{"text":"I would come to this place more often except for two things ... it's not near anything I go to on a regular basis so it always has to be a special trip; and depending on time of day it can be very crowded. So far then today was my fourth visit.  I purposely waited until after 2 PM and that was a good plan because there were only a couple of other people there. Not that it made a lot of difference to the girl behind the counter, she was not the friendliest person I've met.

The place is accurately described by a lot of other reviewers, except for the sad fact that too many of them describe the place negatively. Those are the ones who normally eat at McDonalds and hate places that are old, have character, are not a chain and are basically just a simple mom & pop trying to make a living. It's amazing how many people choose to go to a local dive and then complain that it looks like a dive. From my perspective Cheese and Stuff is what the owners want it to be ... just an old time neighborhood deli.

As such it baffles me how someone could compare them to Subway or any other mega-chain. The only thing they have in common is that they both sell sandwiches.  Cheese 'n Stuff can only be compared to itself. On that score, they make a good non-pretentious sandwich and sell it for a reasonable price. I had the Sicilian this time and no, it wasn't huge and it wasn't packed with a ton of stuff.  Just a few slices of meat, a slice of cheese and a light filling of shredded lettuce and some tomato slices, topped with Italian salad dressing. The bread is fresh and airy so it doesn't overpower the meat and cheese (and doesn't feel it has to be some pretentious fancy bread ... it's just bread).  The meat and cheese are the stars here, despite the portions being small (you can order your sandwich with extra meat or cheese) they use premium quality Boar's Head products for the most part. The result is a sandwich you can taste, not something stuffed with so many different things you end up not being able to taste anything.

Cheese 'n Stuff isn't a great deli, nor is it a great sandwich shop. Their selection of meats, cheeses and imported goods is small and eclectic and for the most part not any different from what you can find at AJ's. Their people skills show signs of being a bit worn out from the many years they've been at the job. Their décor is no-frills functional (I mean seriously, some people complained about the tables?)

Will I go back? Of course, whenever I'm nearby and feeling hungry. There are a lot of things on the menu that sound good. I might even stop in and buy some meat or cheese from time to time.  In the overall scope of things I like the place, which is the classic definition of 4-stars."}
{"text":"I have been going here for about twenty years and have tried almost everything. Not disappointed with anything. Favorites are the Tyler and the doughboy. Or my favorite, I tell them to.surprise me."}
{"text":"Subs are tasty but small and expensive! Potato salad didn't  taste yammi  for me! Place by itself tiny!"}
{"text":"This place makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside- what's better than an old school family owned and operated deli that serves up high quality sandwiches at great prices. I have been coming here for years and will continue to do so for years to come!"}
{"text":"It's just good normal food in central Phoenix that is without pretension. I like the breakfast sandwiches and they are always super friendly. In my opinion the only thing that would make this place better is if they served alcohol and had a smoking patio, but hey that's just me."}
{"text":"I am so glad this place exists.  It's such a strange little throwback to east coast style delis.  The service here is truly amazing, they just don't treat people like this much anywhere else.  They get to know you, they smile, wink, tell jokes, make you feel good about buying your lunch. I buy local whenever I can, and love that I can eat here before or after a little shopping jaunt to the ultra-local strip behind here that includes Halo, Frances, Red Hot Robot, Stinkweeds and Smeeks.  It's also right on the light rail.

The macaroni salad is my favorite anywhere.  I know everyone wants exactly what they want, which is often what their grandma/mom/Aunt Jenny made.  Lucky for me, this stuff tastes just like home to me. I can hardly drive by without stopping in for at the very least, a cup of macaroni salad. If I am lucky, I'm hungry, and I can get a cheese sandwich, (which is perfect in every way) or something with the Russian dressing on it.  (The Russian dressing makes me want to get naked and swim around in it.)

The weirdest thing about this place is the menu, which is on randomly placed sheets of paper hanging over the deli counter.  Do not rush, take your time.  Read it all, they don't mind.  They have a pre-printed menu, which has some (but not all) of the items on it, so you can start sorting things in your head.  The first time I went in I ordered whatever struck my fancy first, and while waiting for it to be made, I found about ten other things I might have ordered instead."}
{"text":"I don't know why, but when you see a huge neon sign that says \"CHEESE N STUFF\", one would expect to see some friggin cheese, right? There was havarti, cheddar, brie....blah blah blah....I can pick that shiz up at Bashas. There were no specialty cheeses or meats. There were about 15 choices of sandwiches, potato salad, macaroni salad, german potato salad and chips. Thats about it. One of the deli cases actually just had chips in it. The shelves had a few boxes of little cookies from other countries but was otherwise their back stock of coke and water. 3 long community tables with fold out chairs were about all that fit in this small place. Its on its 67th anniversary and totally looks like it. Staff was nice...ish. We were the only people in there and when we walked in neither the younger lady or the older man said anything til we said Hi. Then, we got \"are  you ready to order\" from the younger girl. I got an italian sub with salami, mortadella and ham but it was way too much bread to meat ratio and drowned in italian dressing. My friends both got the Bismark with pastrami and roast beef and really enjoyed that sandwich. Mac salad was ok. We didn't try dessert because there were none on display. Just hand written signs everywhere telling you they had brownies and cheesecake. No reason for me to come back here."}
{"text":"I ordered the number 10 make it a meal that includes macaroni salad and a drink. I enjoyed my sub but the macaroni salad was a little sweet for my liking. Total can out to $9.04 which also included a glass of iced tea (that is delicious). I might be back, I might not."}
