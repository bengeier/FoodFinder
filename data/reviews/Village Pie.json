{"text":"This place brings me back to Greece, the pies are so good it's that tasty!! 

It's a little pricier than other places that carry the spinach or cheese pies but worth it. The leek potatoes soup was very good as well!!"}
{"text":"Delicious pies and soups! Seems like high quality ingredients and home cooking. Great for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Was out for a walk and went in to this place for a snack. Lovely savoury pies. Fresh- made that day."}
{"text":"I got a kourou pie ($5) as a snack. Korou is a hand held pie with a feta interior and a phyllo exterior. I hope I got that right. For $5, I wasn't particularly impressed, but perhaps it's the food itself that didn't particularly impress me. I don't have much to compare it with, but it tasted like its component parts. It was rather one-dimensional. It was very filling though, so that's a plus. Service is friendly. I do like the interior seating area. There's bar seating and also a few small tables. If you're into Greek style pies, they have a ton to try, so I suppose if I'm in the area again, I'm down to try another. All pie slices are $5 each and whole pies go for $24."}
{"text":"This review is not for the food, it's for the website - I didn't even get there, since I got so frustrated with the digital experience: first, I tried to look over their menu before I start my journey (it's pretty far from where I am located, so I needed to know if it was worth my time) - the menu page is empty; then, I tried contacted them using the web form - message failed to send repeatedly; so I decided to write them an email and let them know - the email link sent me to an \"item not found\" page...... guess I won't be tasting Greek pies any time soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious pies, very nice owners, tiny but cozy seating area. They offer meat, cheese, leak, chicken, spinach pies as well as apple pie, custard pie, baklava and loukoumades. They except debit and credit cards."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a quick snack and I wasn't disappointed. I ordered a slice of feta+spinach pie along with a soup of the day, which cost $10+tax. Very reasonable IMHO. The pie had a nice crusty crust and it didn't taste stale. It was baked that same day. I especially loved their baklava, which was unfortunately overpriced at $5/piece. It was a big piece, but still. The Greek doughnuts (Loukoumades) were equally delicious, moist and soft on the inside. Totally worth $1/doughnut.

I'd probably go back next time I'm craving a Greek pie when I'm in that neighbourhood. However, there are PLENTY of really good authentic Greek restaurants in the area with all kinds of delicious stuff on the menu. If you're looking to spend $20+ on food, I'd suggest Pan on the Danforth, Mezes or other good restaurants within walking distance. Simply look up Greek restaurants on Yelp with 4-5 stars and 50+ reviews in that neighbourhood and you'll find plenty of options to choose from."}
