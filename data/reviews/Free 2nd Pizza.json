{"text":"Your pizza is crap, your people are crap, your menu is crap.  You take up space on skip the dishes.  Its not a free second pizza.    Go away.  You are a waste of internet bandwidth.   I have never seen a worse pizza than this.  Your pizzas look like the kind I made when I was 8 years old with play dough."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here and it's a popular spot for high schoolers around the area. I've been going to this place since I was in high school. I haven't had a pizza from here in a while though as I don't frequent this plaza too often anymore.

I usually do walk in orders. Dough is soft and chewy. The owner adds very generous amount of toppings. Got two medium pizzas two toppings on each for about 20 bucks. Not exactly the cheapest pizza around, but it is definitely very tasty."}
