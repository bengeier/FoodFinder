{"text":"Horrendous. This is the worst burger I've ever been served in my half century of living (and I dine out often as a pharmaceutical sales representative). 

I give all new restaurants in Anthem at least one try but would not recommend Ruby's Express to anyone. 

I ordered a Hickory Burger combo with a strawberry shake. I was their only customer on a Monday afternoon. 

My order was up in five minutes. The single patty was burnt and nearly inedible. There was hardly any hickory barbecue sauce on the burger. The minimal bacon was burnt as were the couple of onion rings on top. The fries were pedestrian. My strawberry shake was a cut above McDonald's but way overpriced for the small size. 

I would bet that this Ruby's Express concept will not be around in a year as there are too many good alternatives in the food court with reasonable pricing. They may get some one-time tourist customers patronizing the Outlet Mall but no local would go there twice because of the terrible food and ridiculous prices. 

In and Out Burger is a short distance south on Carefree Highway and I-17 where quality, taste and value leaves Ruby's Express in the weeds."}
{"text":"We love Ruby's Express.  There burgers are always cooked to perfection.  I order the mushroom Swiss burger and fry combo.  My husband orders the guacamole burger combo.  Both are delicious!  The fries are so good .  The staff there is always friendly.  They will give you a free refill for your drink.  If you love a awesome burger and fries Ruby's is your place."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Shakes were really good.  The staff is super friendly.   Will
Always choose Ruby's over any other local burger place.   Now they have hot dogs and chicken sandwiches which are equally as good.   Wish they would open more in AZ."}
{"text":"Located in the Food Court at the Anthem Outlets Mall at I-17 and Anthem Way.  Ruby's is one of a small number of fast food options at the food court... My recommendation is to find a different option.  The burger I had was obviously cooked well before I ordered it - as was the bacon with which it was adorned.  Ruby's burgers appear to be well below Smashburger and In and Out Burger in quality and taste;  It's closer to Jack in the Box and McDonald's.  The soft drink was small and inadequate to wash down the overcooked and dry burger I was served.  The meal my wife and I had was overpriced and forgettable.  There are much better places to eat... and I will not be returning to Ruby's."}
{"text":"My husband ordered a cheeseburger. I got a burrito from the Mexican place down the way. I received and finished my burrito before his burger was ready. when his order finally arrived, it was a meat patty on a bun.  Just a meat patty on a bun. So he took it back to exchange it for the cheeseburger he ordered. Then he was served a meat patty with cheese on a bun. Nothing more. When he asked about the missing lettuce and tomato, as shown on the menu, the manager got defensive, insisted on refunding his money, and said he had to leave or she would call security. We won't be back."}
