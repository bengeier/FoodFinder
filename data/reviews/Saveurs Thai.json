{"text":"Just got back from a lovely dinner at Saveurs Thai. Very nice ambiance and decor. The waitresses were friendly, and the hostess was very accommodating when we called last minute to make a reservation (we were only a party of 2 so she was nice enough to squeeze us in although they were so called \"full\"). My date and I both had the Thai salad to start, which was AH-mazing! Not so much a typical salad, but a mix of fried noodles, green and red bell peppers, a bit of iceberg lettuce, lightly tossed in a sweet/ tangy sesame dressing. I would go back just for that :) As a main, I got a ginger, coconut milk and curry shrimp with rice, which was a huge portion. Very generous on the shrimp, I got 8 in my dish! It was good, with the right amount of kick to it, but overall nothing to write home about. My date got a similar dish but with beef, and felt the same way about his. We shared the \"banana doughnut\" for dessert, which is simply a deep fried banana served with vanilla ice cream. While it was tasty, there was too much batter which made for a very crunchy shell. The prices are reasonable, and the portion generous, which make it a good bet! Bonus: it's a BYOW :) Next time we go, we'll try the table d'h√¥te option where you grill your own meat skewers on a mini grill at your table! Looked like a cool concept but we didn't order because the meal contained a lot of meat, and it was served for 2 (I'm a \"vegetarian\".. but eat fish and seafood). A must try!"}
{"text":"I am reviewing this order based on take-out, so I cannot comment on the in-house service or atmosphere.  Considering how many Thai and Asian places there are in the area, I would skip this place.  Overall, the prices seemed too high for the portions they gave and the food was only ok.  I ordered two salads the Thailandaise and the Cambodgienne salad. The thailandaise salad was very good and tasty, probably the best thing I ate all night. The Cambodgienne salad was very bland. The dressing was almost tasteless so it was essentially a bed of iceburg lettuce with some slices of chicken on top. Extremely disappointing and not worth the money I paid for it at all.  The dishes I ordered were beef and broccoli, chicken in peanut sauce, and crevettes aux trois saveurs. The beef and broccoli and the shrimp dish were okay, but nothing special. The chicken in peanut sauce tasted pretty good but the crispy spinach that came with it was not crispy at all and there was only about 1 forkful. (I live about 2 minutes away from the restaurant, so travel time wouldn't have made it soggy. I did show up 5 minutes earlier than they told me to and the meal was already done and sitting on the counter, so the crispy spinach probably sat for some time.)  Extra disappointing since I pretty much begged for an extra bowl of crispy spinach but they (the 3 different people I spoke to on the phone in French and English) didn't understand me. Oh well, it would have probably been soggy anyways.  Like I said at the beginning, considering the options in the area, and the price to portion ratio, I would go elsewhere."}
