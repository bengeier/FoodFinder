{"text":"I'm from Cincinnati but have been working in Cleveland for the past few months and am very happy to have discovered Sakura.  I've eaten there twice and everything has been beautifully prepared and quite delicious.  The rainbow roll is a fave.  Monday specials include $3 regular rolls, sushi and sashimi and $6 special rolls."}
{"text":"Great food but horrible customer service. Make sure you know what to order because they will not adjust the bill."}
{"text":"We've eaten inside and ordered take out from here. Small and intimate. Great food and sushi."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I LOVEEEEE Sakura Sushi House! We are big hibachi fans! I love the environment as its small, laid back but provides an elegant feel and romantic appeal. If you want to be very one on one with the person you are eating with, then this place is perfect. ESPECIALLY if you love sushi or this style of food.   I'm very impressed with the customer service and family warmth you get when you eat here. I've been to eat in a large group as well as on single dates. Its always great service, and better food.  I would describe this place as a hidden gem. Its located right across the street from another sushi bar and a few steps down from Shintos as well. So its no surprise that most people give me a weird look when i mention it.  Overall, if your not ignorantly picky, this restaurant is a good choice for family dinner, a date, just stopping by to get some sushi!"}
{"text":"cheap food. sushi was so-so. the avocado didn't taste very fresh. bathrooms and restaurant were very clean. good service."}
{"text":"I have only been here once.  The sushi is good and the prices are even better.  It's still not as good as some of the sushi I have had.  I will give it that it is a million times better than Tomo across the street.  I plan on coming back soon and hopefully have a good experience again."}
{"text":"I don't give exaggerated reviews.  I love sushi and sashimi having eaten all over this country as well as Japan.  I don't understand the complaints about this place. Their service is very good, I have been quite satisfied with everything I have eaten there, their sushi bar puts out very good seafood. This is the best sushi & sashimi in the area, and it high on the list of great sushi I have had anywhere"}
{"text":"I don't know why we don't go here more. We are never disappointed. Everything is so fresh and the surrounds are very clean. The Hibachi is as good as the sushi. It's not covered in oil and butter like some of the other local places and you don't leave smelling like a grease fire. The only improvement that could be made is the yum yum sauce."}
{"text":"Delicious! Delicious! delicious!  When we first moved to the neighborhood we were looking for a sushi place around and randomly found this amazing place! The place is not big but is so cozy and welcoming! Stuff is always welcoming and friendly! Service is always on point and the most important food is outstanding! So so fresh and delicious!!!! And the price is just right!  Love it! And recommend it to anyone who loves good and fresh sushi!"}
{"text":"Great newer sushi spot on Pearl. Yes, the location isn't the best, but oh well.   Speciality rolls are fresh and you can find really creative combinations. Sakura  #1, Sushi Cake, yum! Really wonderfully tasting sushi with specials almost everyday.   Super friendly staff, great food and nice ambiance. Much better everything than Tomo, which is across the street."}
{"text":"Very fresh food and tasted great! creative rolls! Good value. Overall just great."}
{"text":"I ate a dish which is not on the menu, mullet fish(\"zi yu\" in Chinese), so delicious hahah, that's because I can speak Chinese to the owner."}
{"text":"If I could give them less of a rating I would. We sat there for 20 minutes when they weren't even busy before anyone bothered to come take drink orders. The smell of the place started to make me nauseous as I'm 6 months pregnant so we decided to leave. As soon as we got up two people rushed over demanding we pay for our water and Diet Coke which had not been touched. They didn't bother asking us why we were leaving and just made a huge scene over a 1 coke. It was ridiculous because we were headed to the front to pay for it anyway. They don't have Japanese sushi on the menu and service was miserable during our very short stay."}
{"text":"I love Sakura.  Perfect lunch place if you like sushi.  Service is great.  Sushi delicious and reasonably priced.  Restaurant is pretty small with a generic look to it (unlike Shinto, which has a colorful & trendy vibe).  I wouldn't take a date here for dinner, but a great option for a working lunch with co-workers or colleagues."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and were so pleased. Definitely a hidden treasure in Strongsville. Beautiful presentation and delicious."}
{"text":"Great for lunch! Used a restaurant.com coupon. Got some sushi and it was perfect. Brought the kids to! Attentive service, ok atmosphere, good location. Overall very nice and affordable!"}
{"text":"I like this place because I can always count on fresh sushi to go fairly quickly. The half price Monday Sushi is a treat."}
{"text":"This was my second time here for lunch and all I can say is Wow!!!  The service is wonderful and the sushi is great!!!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and delicious. Tried the pink lady by recommendation however it was too messy and sweet for my taste. Also tried the dragon roll and loved it. The shrimp tempura roll was very good too.  The place is small but clean and fast and good service."}
{"text":"Shared the Green Hat and Pink Lady rolls with my daughter. Very clean tasting sushi. Would come back if I'm in Strongsville again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place has gone downhill from when they opened. I became a regular of Sakura after a few great experiences dining in. Then, I started ordering take out. It seems that over time their portions got smaller & smaller while their prices got higher & higher. The teriyaki dinners used to come with fried rice & vegetables and now come with white rice and a bed of grilled onions (yes, you read that correctly). The quality of the meat seems lower as well. It is unfortunate that a place I used to enjoy has now stopped their high quality and attention to service."}
{"text":"Service is great and the sushi is pretty good also.  Only knock I would say is that they only have Merlot and Cabernet (house wines)  So don't go here looking for a good bottle.  Sushi YES, Wine NO.  I would go back because its a nice place to grab decent food."}
{"text":"Was supposed to  another happy hour  $3 rolls! With a large hot saki to accompany it. Never got the saki but was charged $9.95 for it on the bill!   Then as I was driving home I saw we were charged the regular price for the rolls! Two big mistakes on one bill is unacceptable!!!  Sushi was however delicious!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I came here for an early dinner. And we had no negative rolls. The food came quickly and the people here we're friendly. The Restraunt is small but it is cozy not confining. We wish we had known about it sooner."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but don't expect to get your food right away. The service is not great and it took more than an hour for us to get our food and the server didn't tell us that refills on hot tea was extra charge. If you want to eat their food, do a take out.. They're sushi portion is bigger than what I'd expected. I got the golden dragon roll and it was on the sweet side because they put a lot of eel sauce on top of it but it was delicious. Their hibachi isn't too bad. The meat was tender and their yum yum sauce was good.   Overall the food is definitely a 4 but because of the long wait and terrible service it's only 3."}
{"text":"Love this spot! The cost can add up, but their sushi always tastes great. Avocado salad is very simple, and other than the slices of avocado on top, really isn't worth it... Would not get it again. However, their miso soup is a wonderful, warm hug that soothes the soul, especially on cold winter days."}
{"text":"The Sushi is of course made to order and I found the quality to be quite good.  The sushi rice is slightly warm and the uncooked fish is of decent quality. Although the quality is not astronomical, the sushi is quite well made presented and served. This is consistent with their Maki as well as rolls served . Their menu offers the usual flare and diversity of cooked and uncooked Sushi rolls.  However if you are Like your sushi a particular way just ask they will do their best to please you. For a lunch time Sushi indulgence in the south west burbs, Sakura is a great choice.  I was not impressed with the teriyaki. I found the sauce to be far too thin and almost tasted as if it was simple warmed up in the oven.  I will likely steer clear of their teriyaki and stick with sushi in subsequent visit. They do have hibachi on their menu but note that its not made in front of you like the hibachi restaurants. It's prepared in the kitchen.   I've been to  Sakura Sushi House twice thus far. Both times for lunch.  It's set up as a corner store front next to Sherwin Williams.  Finding this place isn't difficult however one can easily mistake another sushi house across the street for Sakura at first.  The ambiance is somewhat simple however the place is well lit. It's mostly always quiet however does provide ample seating for larger groups. The sushi bar provides seating for maybe around 6 at a time."}
{"text":"Amazing ! Super fresh! Great big portions ! The service is excellent. I live on the east side but I will come out here whenever I'm in the area because this is just fantastic ! The quality of food is amazing."}
{"text":"We tried this little sushi place for dinner and found it had the best sushi around..this is truly a hidden gem. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing place, there are many sushi and hibachi options around the area. If you are going for a hibachi show go there. If you want amazing sushi come to Sakura!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but because of the small size of the restaurant the wait staff stood over my dads shoulder the entire time. She rushed over anytime I mentioned what I was thinking of ordering. It was uncomfortable eating while the entire staff watched on. Food was good though"}
{"text":"Good, consistent quality sushi all the time. I have eaten there over a couple dozen times. Small, intimate sushi restaurant with NO Hibachi grills, just concentrating on good sushi. My favorite Maki roll is the Elf, my favorite appetizer is the Tuna with Fuji Apple and avocado. On certain nights of the week, they have special pricing on either sushi or regular Maki rolls. Still reasonably priced without the special pricing of those nights."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place! The owners are great and the chefs are fabulous. They know exactly what we want when we come in and take the time to make our special order. Great sushi. Great people."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now.  Each time was delicious! I haven't tried any Chinese except the won ton soup which was average.  I have tried a few of the rolls which have hit the spot.  The first time I dined in, and the service was great.  They actually made vegetarian noodles for my friend and threw in some additional vegetables.  When I ordered take-out, the food was ready very fast.  I'll have to try the sushi specials, that sounds like a terrific value!"}
{"text":"YUM! Nice little find in Strongsville. The sushi is delicious and on Sundays they have discounts. Even the full priced sushi is not outrageous and still delicious."}
{"text":"This is really, some pretty good sushi. Especially for the price on their special menu and with their discount.   My favorites here are the California Crunch and the Butterfly Roll. The miso soup is a little on the bland side in comparison to others I've had. The edamame always comes out pretty good. But, overall, we did enjoy this place, and would recommend it as a solid alternative.  I've never dined in here, just take out."}
{"text":"Eh, this place is OK. The sushi wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special either. I tried some traditional nigiri style sushi as well as some not so traditional special rolls to sort of test the authenticity of this place (I enjoy both ends of the spectrum), and I'd have to say  it leans heavily on the side of Americanized sushi.  For nigiri I had the ikura (salmon roe), uni (sea urchin), and tamago (egg). The ikura was decent, the uni didn't taste like anything (and was probably frozen before), and the tamago just tasted like regular scrambled egg.   I found their specialty roll menu to be... unique? Very uh interesting combinations, with ingredients like kiwi and crawfish. I didn't venture too far out of my comfort zone and ended up with the Pink Lady roll on the recommendation of our server. I can't remember all of the ingredients but I know it had shrimp tempura and mango. I wasn't keen on having fruit in my sushi, but the mango was subtle in flavor and added sort of a refreshing aspect to every bite. Definitely the highlight of the meal. I also had the lobster maki (special) and shrimp tempura roll (regular), both of which were forgettable. I will say that the special rolls are huge. 10 large piece to each roll, so you shouldn't have a problem getting full.   The customer service was really, really friendly and attentive. Our waitress was genuinely nice and outgoing to us and everyone that came in. Top notch service.  Overall, the sushi was alright but nothing that would bring me back anytime soon. It gets 2 stars with a bonus star for excellent service."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks! Great service and friendly staff. I highly recommend this place, it's a hidden gem! Got the love boat for two and couldn't even finish it. Well worth the price!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is pretty tiny, but they have some great sushi for even better prices. Sunday - Tuesday they have some of the best specials on sushi I have found around the area, and the don't lack in quality. If you go in to eat I find the waitresses hover a little too much for my liking, but I always enjoy the sushi. I have not tried much else on the menu. I was very disappointed with their soup though. And, the calamari that I have tried was excellent."}
{"text":"Fair to midland. That's what I have to say about this place.   My husband ordered two sushi rolls, both were good. He also ordered a bowl of the beef noodle soup. We did not know, nor were we told, that it was a TROUGH OF SOUP! AND it cost $12!!  I ordered a spicy chicken dish. It was mostly green and red peppers, which I don't like. It was ok, but not great.   I wasn't thrilled"}
{"text":"Good place for lunch. I ordered Steak Teriyaki for $7.95 and my father ordered Chicken Teriyaki for $6.95. We tried a little of both. Both dishes were prepared over a bed of saut√©ed onions and served with a cup of white rice. The steak and chicken were tender and flavorful. The onions were a little strong but did enhance the flavor of the meats.   The only real knock I could give is that you're only allowed one free refill per beverage.   Overall, it was good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I'm asian so I have pretty high standard for sushi. food wise- I ordered tuna roll and eel cucumber roll. Tuna was not fresh and it was two smaller tuna pieces instead of one bigger one, nori was not crispy, the rolls were not tight,  for both sushi the rice is not right. The sushi chef was chatting about stuff not related to work while he was making sushi.  Chopsticks are wooden and old, the checkbook was falling apart.   Service is pretty good.   ----------  I'm here for a second time and I order chinese food instead. It is way better than Sushi! They just hired a new chinese chef."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi restaurant in the area! I like that they focus on sushi, rather than habachi like all other \"sushi\" restaurants in the Cleveland area. Great service, very attentitive, polite, welcoming, and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went here for a second time the other day. The restaurant is small so consider making a reservation. The sushi was amazing like the last time. Very fresh and tasty!  My boyfriend ordered steak hibachi and the steak was overcooked. The service was subpar we had to ask for refills and they never asked us if we needed anything. All in all a good experience.   On Monday and Tuesday Sakura has discounted sushi, which is awesome. The mini sushi rolls and sashimi is $3 and the larger rolls are $6."}
{"text":"This was our first time in Strongsville. We spend our whole Friday truck shopping so sushi was exactly what I needed after a long day.   Right off the bat we ordered edamame and it was really yummy. I wanted to order some to go it was so good.   We are avid sushi eaters so we try out a lot of new places but not all of them always impress us. This place really did earn 5 stars from us!!  We ordered 5 different rolls. California crunch, 2 California rolls with cream cheese, paradise roll, spicy killer & tropical. We were so happy with them all. Soo soo good!!!   The service was very good. Oddly enough we were the only people in the whole restaurant on a Friday night but I'll take it because we got in and out very quickly.  Overall I am very very happy with our decision to eat here. It might just become our new date night spot!   If I had one down side it would be that it was a little pricey. We paid $70 after tip for two people."}
{"text":"Came for sushi and was kinda disappointed. The spider special roll we ordered came out as only 5 pieces. The Boston roll had almost no shrimp and was filled with lettuce. Also it fell apart easily when we tried to pick it up with the chopstick. The spicy shrimp roll had a odd taste in it. I been to many different sushi place around the Cleveland and Toledo area so I will say it not the worst place for sushi. It does have good prices on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. But I'm not sure if I will visit this place again for sushi."}
{"text":"First time at Sakura tonight -- loved it!  Friendly service, great quality rolls, fair prices. Will go back soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sushi I've had since moving to Ohio three years ago.  This will be our go-to  place from now on. A friendly staff,  quiet atmosphere,  and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi place in the area. I love the fact that you can get Chinese food as well! Very friendly service. I have nothing negative to say about Sakura. Prices are good, food is great. I love the hot and sour soup, California crunch rolls and the fried rice. When I think sush, I think Sakura!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and I've always thought it was just ok. However, this past trip I ordered the Spicy Phoenix roll...it was soooo good. Crab and crawfish rolled into spicy goodness topped with an even spicier sauce that was delicious.  I would highly recommend this roll to the sushi lover."}
{"text":"I had a run in with them when I dined in once over a groupon, they were rude and I won't go into the gruesome details. But it let a bad taste in my mouth for sure.   One thing saved them in my opinion, it when I realized that on Mondays and Tuesdays when they have their $3 sushi rolls that you can also order them to-go for the same price. So in the rare event that I can't find anyone to take advantage of the great half off sushi deals in Strongsville I know I can count on Sakura. The sushi isn't out of this world, but gets the job done!"}
{"text":"The interior of this place could use some revamping--it is almost a casual diner atmosphere.  The bad thing about the front tables is that every time someone enters the front doors, you get a blast of cold air (this being winter).  I thought the  sushi and sashimi combo was very good and fresh--although the portions were somewhat small.  Ok, given the reasonable price.  The funny thing is that you get either miso soup OR salad.  Most places will have both.  Would highly recommend trying the Sushi Cake and Pink Lady specialty rolls.   Green tea is also not from loose leaf but rather made from tea bag in a cup.  Sampled Shrimp cashew and Saut√©ed green beans from the Chinese menu--Cantonese style and not impressive.   Overall, a good experience and worth trying again.  I would even try some of their non-sushi offerings as the table next to us looked like they got nice big bowls of noodle soups."}
{"text":"Good sushi, but still probably wouldn't go back because of an awkward run in with the staff. My friend and I were catching up after not seeing each other for over a year, and one of the waitresses asked us if we could leave since we were finished eating. They had two people waiting for a table, who had just walked into the door. Disappointing experience without a doubt."}
{"text":"We had sushi last night and this was an awesome choice! We enjoyed the California crunch roll, tropical roll, spicy killer roll, and the paradise roll. This was the first sushi I've had with a piece of mango in each bite. The fresh mango added a burst of freshness to every bite! The only reason this wasn't 5 star is because the communication with our server wasn't the best but then again we aren't fluent in Japanese. However, you should definitely visit this location!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi was very good. I came on a Tuesday and they had plenty of cheap sushi specials to choose from. I had the Tiger Crunch (spicy shrimp tempura with cookie flakes) and the Crazy Roll (california roll with spicy salad on top) and they were both excellent. My boyfriend got Hibachi which he said was good but not great. The service was mediocre but I will definitely be back for the sushi!"}
{"text":"Today, the wife and I had some time away from the kids where we could eat at a restaurant that WE like.  So the wife looked up the nearest sushi shop with the highest yelp ratings.  Upon arrival, the place was small and nearly empty, so we were promptly seated.  The waitress let us review the menus for a few minutes before asking what we wanted to drink.  We ordered water, how exciting!  Then we ordered three sushi rolls and plate of chicken lo main.  Rerun Cavs games were showing on the TV, so we watched that while we chatted and waited for the offerings.  Finally, the chicken lo main arrived and it was a very large portion; enough for two!  So we shared that, but before we could polish it off, the sushi arrived.  It was presented with elegance and looked very appetizing.    The chicken lo main was absolutely delicious.  I loved it and I would order it again and again.  The chicken was fresh and tasted of good quality.  The noodles honestly reminded me of spaghetti, but were also very good.  The sushi was fresh made and delicious.  The quality was better than most of what I've had anywhere.  Even the sauces on the sides of the plate were tasty.  The size of the sushi was huge.  I could barely fit a piece into my mouth.  My wife's roll was served with ginger and wasabi, neither of which she likes.  Mine was served only with ginger, so I stole her wasabi and mixed it with my soy sauce, as is my ritual.  I ordered the Paradise roll, and it was yummy.  I don't recall which rolls my wife ordered, but they were both awesome.  One of them had eel in it.  They have two different types of soy sauce.  The red lid is regular and the green lid is low-sodium.  I do not remember the brand name, but it was not Kikkoman!  Recommend."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to try this place based on the reviews on Yelp.  The sushi was delicious,  especially the Island Paradise.   It was nothing we have tried before,  but in a very good way.  Very tasty, we would definitely order it again.   My sister ordered the calamari. It was crunchy and delicious and cooked properly.  I ordered the lunch portion of pork fried rice.   This was the only thing that was just mediocre.   Not great flavor,  just kind of bland.   I wouldn't get this again.   Overall,  we will most likely return."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I live maybe 5 minutes away and visit here at least twice a month.  I like the sushi here.  They are always made to order.  It's not the best sushi I've ever had.  And it's not the worst.  It's pretty good.  That said, I don't go to this place for sushi.  I go here because their menu covers a lot of ground.  And I really like the Thai food here.  Want sushi?  They have 2-3 pages to choose from.  Chinese?  You got it.  Thai?  Japanese?  Yes and yes.  I almost always order the green curry chicken (it's spicy) every time I visit.  There are usually a bay leaf or 2 I have to fish out out of the sauce.  It doesn't get any fresher than that.    I decided to try something different last night.  So I went with the Szechuan chicken.  And the Egg Drop soup.  I took pictures, but forgot to take the picture of the Szechuan chicken before I added the rice.  The soup comes out lava hot and delicious.  It tastes like homemade broth was waiting for the eggs to be dropped in.  So delicious.  The Szechuan chicken had a rich and almost smoky taste.  It was a rich sauce with some heat to it.  Portion was huge and I certainly didn't leave hungry.  The chicken portion was rather large and the vegetables were cooked crisp tender and cut to perfection.  And the diversity of the menu is what is perfect for my family.  My wife ordered hibachi chicken.  My one daughter ordered sushi.  The other ordered pork dumplings and fried rice.  Everyone loves the food here.  My wife is the one who wanted to go here for New Year's Eve.    The exact same employees are here every time we visit.  Their accent is thick and sometimes there is a communication issue.  For example, if you order 6 sushi they think you mean 6 orders.  It's worth clarifying everything with them.  I always do and have no problems.  The food is simply fantastic."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! Some of the best sushi we have ever had and for a reasonable price. Small restaurant, but had a great atmosphere. Service is excellent, employees are very friendly, attentive, and polite. Food comes quickly after ordered. Never been disappointed coming here, I would definitely recommend trying the Volcano Roll. I don't remember what it is called or what exactly was in it but there is also a coconut or paradise roll... soooo delicious!"}
{"text":"Always love Sakura, everyone is friendly and nice and caring. The Chinese food secret menu is fabulous (the fried wrapping pork - ???, fried eggplant - ???, fried green beans - ?????, udon noodle soup with Chinese baby bok choi and mushrooms - ???????, soy sauce boiled pork with Chinese baby bok choi - ???/???, fried tofu skin wrap with veggies - ????? ...) The restaurant has great and authentic southern Chinese food makes me feel like home! Also if you are not afraid of fish bones please try the salmon head soup, it is really great. Additionally the sushi is very nice as well. I tried all kinds of different rolls and none of them was a disappointment, they were all good."}
