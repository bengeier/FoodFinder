{"text":"El Charrito, simply put, is an average Mexican joint. What it has going for it is friendly service, good specials, and strong drinks. In terms of Mexican food, you really have to get my attention, and El Charrito really did not wow me. If you want affordable food that is palatable, Charrito is your place."}
{"text":"El Charrito... not so bueno. Everything from the chips and salsa to the shrimp fajitas were way to salty. I will not waste my time or money there again. I would rather drive the extra half hour to enjoy Cozumels. At least when my tummy hurts after Cozumels, it is because I enjoyed it so much I couldn't stop eating. Not so much here."}
{"text":"I went here with my roommate because she had a diners club coupon.  

The food was super expensive for what you got in the quality of the food was really poor.  I had a combination plate with an enchilada a burrito and a taco and not of them were any good.

I can make better Mexican food with my two-year-old daughter.  

On the upside the staff was really friendly and the atmosphere wasn't bad.  However the overall experience was really disappointing and kind of expensive for what I received.

I will not be going back to this place.  Ever."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here.
It is one if the places that I keep going back to since it is close to work.  In last three years, there have been 3 different mexican restaurants in one spot just down the street - but this one is still going on..... That should tell you something. There are lots of options in the vicinity.
I have only had lunch here. Prices are in line with lunch options in the area.....actually a buck or two cheaper.
I love their salsa. Little heavy on garlic. And they add celery. You would not think it belongs there.... But taste pretty good. Just a little watery.....but flavorful.
Also ask for their hot salsa. It has a nice kick of habanero.
Of course, home made chips are awesome. Nicely seasoned.
Their refried beans beans are OK. Nothing special. Same can be said about their rice.
I like the seasoning of their chicken fajitas, but the veggie fajita I had today was bland.
Their ranchero sauce was good. I would say a bit salty though.
Service is good. Nothing to complain about. Place is clean. 
Overall, not a bad place to eat if you don't mind simplicity."}
{"text":"Decent place, but nothing special. The food was tasty, but just the usual Mexican restaurant fare. I had a beef chimichanga and was pleased that you could get it with queso instead of ranchero sauce. The margaritas were good, as was the fried ice cream, but none of it was anything I haven't had before. Service was friendly,  but slow and forgetful. I'd go back if nearby, but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Went for the first time. Great service and our food was great.  Ordered the chimi chunga.... Different than Chi Chi's but I expected that since they were a chain restaurant.  It was delicious though none the less ! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great Mexican joint! Been coming here since I was a kid. The sangria soda was excellent. The chips and salsa are always great. It was Wednesday fajita night also, $9.99 for a gigantour portion of chicken and faj veggies! Enough to take some home. Best guacamole! El Charritto es Pachugas!!!"}
{"text":"\"There is no accounting for taste,\" or so they say, and in this case, I am inclined to agree. For almost no definable reason, like a doomed high school romance, I am convinced that I am in love with El Charrito. 
   Is it their sangria, served in glasses sized for giants and sporting a veritable floating fruit garden? No, its made from a store bought powdered mix. 
   Is it the equally colorful and cluttered \"authentically Mexican\" decor? Don't get me wrong, inflatable Corona bottles are nice, but I typically eat in the exposure of the elements. I prefer the lawn furniture scattered across their patio/driveway/parking lot. Besides being blindingly sunny, this seating is known to experience mini floods whenever the local greenery is watered...so it cant be that.
   So it must be the menu, right? So blandly Americanized, mostly meatless, and thoroughly forgetable? Unlikely. I have learned to make a meal of the cilantro infused, less-than-spicy but still more-than-flavorful fresh salsa and seasoned tortilla chips. Some days, I forget that they even have a menu.
   Like summer kisses exchanged but never cherished, I have no answer for why I have chosen this guilty pleasure. Yet, almost twice a month I would return to this dalliance among delicious yet generic beverages and complementary chips...there is no accounting for tastes."}
{"text":"The restaurant is now a part of Mario's, across the street from the original location. The food we absolutely terrible and doesn't even remotely resemble authentic Mexican food. The ground beef had no seasoning; the chicken was dry; the chorizo was very greasy; the beans were overcooked with a crusty coating over them. We ordered margaritas and were served \"mini margaritas\" that were so full of ice you were lucky to get two sips out of the glass. I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"First off I just want to say the bartender who served us was absolutely beautiful!  She would be the only reason I'd ever go back!

Don't know where to begin!  Paprika on the chips??!? No Bueno!  The food was not good. Tasted like everything was heated up from a bag or something. Nothing authentic. The owners got into a huge shouting match in front of everybody which scared my guest to death, since it seem like they were about to fight. The police were called. Lol. 
On a positive note the drinks were great and cheap!  
If you want great Mexican Food then go to El Palenque!
Man was she gorgeous!!!!!"}
{"text":"Now combined with Mario's across the street it is now a Mexican restaurant in a bar, pool table and all. The food is very good but no Mexican flare to the environment. Maybe they will make improvements over time. Go ahead and give them a try."}
{"text":"It's better then Taco Bell, El Rodeo, La Fiesta, Jalapeno Loco, and Chi Chi's I can attest to.  I'll even cross the line and say its better then Zocalo downtown, that's right, I said it.  Each time I've been there, this past weekend included, the food has been very good.  

I particularly like the Charrito cause it is small and dainty, because of the dorky (newly) painted building, and mostly because they truly care about the quality of their food....maybe a little too much.  I really hate to hear reviews from people who only go to a place once and try something with the expectations that it will compare to a small village restaurant they went to last summer in the depths of Mexico.  It's Wickliffe, not the Yucatan, not some 5 star joint downtown that you need to wear a coat to, it's just a small hole in the wall.  

I really enjoy the chimichanga  with white queso sauce and the cheese chili relleno with corn tortillas.  The burritos are huge, the guacamole is fresh, and they have a good selection of Mexican beers.  The tortillas are nicely seasoned and thin but have a great flavor. 

 I opt out of the dinner options only cause I like to try various menu items with out being filled up with extras but I hear the rice and beans are good.  I personally tasted the mole sauce from the in-laws plate and that was really good compared to other establishments.  Father in-law especially liked the jumbo margarita.  

El Charrito is a place to go if you are hungry and maybe within 5 or so miles, but don't go way out of your way, just go to Abuelo's, cause that's probably the Mexican version of Applebee's you were really looking for."}
{"text":"I haven't figure out what kind of Mexican restaurant it is. The food flavor is so so. Nothing to be thrill about. I had better Mexican food than this place. The decoration is really nice. 

When I want to eat in a Mexican restaurant, I like to taste the authenticity of the regional food. Otherwise, I can go to Taco Bell for a so-called Mexican food."}
{"text":"Haven't lived in Cleveland for 20 years but I can tell you this place is at the very top of the scale.  To clear a few misconceptions, after moving to Southern California in 92, I discovered that this place's food is actually Tex-Mex, not Mexican.  Now where I live a Mexican place ( or two ) is literally on every block.  95% taste worse than this place.  5% taste better.  Not because I love Tex-Mex over Mexican, but because it's true.  20 years later I still think about the place.

I've eaten at ultra-high end Mexican places in Santa Monica as well as regular places across LA and local fav's like a place called ( of all things) Walters in Claremont.  But the best sit-down is Tropical Mexico in Pomona ( right next to a junkyard on a street called East End) or Taco King in Ontario, a place in Azusa which is also a little supermarket, the legendary Juanita's in Pomona which is like an ice cream store in Cleveland-- a sketchy little walk-up place, as well as another walk-up in La Puente which the name escapes me.

El Charrito would be on this list if it were in S California."}
{"text":"This place has it's good and bad, recently moved closer to it so we decided to check it out. First off, they put paprika on their chips!?! never before have I seen that in my mexican restaurant escapades. Anyway, with that aside, the atmosphere is like a dive bar mexican style. It's little and quaint and has some older decor. The menu is large and super confusing, a little pricey for what it is. Many ala carte options, which I did think was a nice touch. I had the chicken enchiladas with a side of rice. I must say it did not taste like the all of the other mexican spots in the area but I can't say it was a good thing. This is a place that you experience for yourself and you either love or hate, unfortunately, mine was the latter of the two."}
{"text":"If there is one thing i can truly emphasize, it's stick to the sangria and chips!! Probably the only reason this is a top destination for a hot summer day. Other than that the regular food leaves a lot to be desired, the outside parking lot\" patio\" floods, and service isn't prompt."}
{"text":"An adequate Mexican place, but nothing more. Everything tastes the same, smothered in relatively bland salsa and cheese. Tables small, crammed together. Service spotty."}
{"text":"Last visit a few weeks back was not so caliente. Chicken fajitas were dry and flavorless. Fish tacos were decent. The mounds and mounds of complimentary refried beans and rice were nice if I was respackling any drywall, but as food, about as palatable as Sofia Vergara. Chips were plentiful and pretty tasty. The end price- astrofrigginholyfrijolenomical. Broke el banco. They must think they are in the same league as Momocho or something just because the words Chipotle, Taco or Bell aren't in their name. Muy malo."}
{"text":"The worst tex mex food i've ever eaten. The only time i've ever gone to a restaurant and couldn't finish my meal, the cheese was burnt and tasted burnt. The margarita machine was dirty, and the staff had an attitude. Horrible."}
