{"text":"This review is for the best scones I  have had since  I was in London. Whole Foods Cranberry and Walnut with a nice top crust with suger. They have several others to choose from but I allways get the Cranberry."}
{"text":"First, I should preface this by saying that I have shopped here for at least 1-2x a week for the better part of two years the staff are some of the friendliest around; I have had no incidents until today.  I was standing in line because I had to run back to the store to pick up 2 items. I was behind a lady that the cashier was ringing up when her husband showed up behind me with a cart filled to the brim asking to move  aside so that he and his wife could check out together. No please, No excuse me, just an ill-mannered, entitled pair. I said no.  I was waiting my turn patiently when the man muttered something about this being \"awkward,\" the cashier then motioned me to another register saying \"she's opening up she will ring you up.\" I could not see over to the other side, so I moved there. Could I check out in peace? No, there were 2 other people ahead of me!  I have no business with this couple, I don't even care about them. I am however completely disappointed in the service I received this evening by CASHIER #4- you are in the wrong for:  A. Giving me misleading information, and B. Treating ill-mannered people as if their time was more important than mine. I did eventually get checked-out by a 3rd cashier and I left the store seething.   I need the management to know that lines are not arbitrary suggestions, they exist for a reason i.e. first come first serve, and while I will gladly allow someone ahead of me, I won't have it forced upon me, not especially when I have 2 frigging items - again CASHIER #4 I am looking at you.  I am mostly furious that I let myself get pushed around by a pair of d-bags, and I yielded to the poor judgment of you guessed it - CASHIER #4.   As an aside: 2 college-age women who really ought to know better, were sampling food from the hot bar with their fingers, licking it and sampling again. What is this mess? No one seemed to notice or care."}
{"text":"Nice place to shop. The meal deal has gone downhill however. If you like spending too much on your items, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"This store pretends to care about the environment by offering a bag credit for not using one of their disposable shopping bags, yet REFUSES to give you a bag credit if you don't need a bag at all!  The cashier told me the incentive was for 'bringing in your own bag' which apparently is taken completely literally.  The cashier refused me a credit even though I could hand carry my 4 items out the door.  It's too bad she and this store could not see the bigger picture and reward customers for minimizing waste and thinking about how we can help the environment.  Very disappointing, Whole Foods..."}
{"text":"Great selection and believe it or not my specific yogurt and kefir is cheaper there than at Walmart! Also love their bakery selection.  Only downside is the tight isles within the store."}
{"text":"I like Whole Foods in general.  Unfortunately,  I got food from the hot bar and got sick once.  Otherwise, this is a cool store."}
{"text":"Two words: free samples!  Hallelujah!   This is the one thing that I wish the co-op offered more of.  It makes the whole \"shopping while hungry\" thing non-existent.  Maybe that's why they don't do it, but WF is great about letting me snack while I shop!   I agree with other reviewers that this place is way, way, way too small and the parking lot makes me want to get violent.  However, I love the fresh produce and the wide array of products.  They have Banana Babies here, which makes me one happy lady!   I think the staff could be a tad friendlier. I feel like I am a pleasant person to have a conversation with, or at least acknowledge, but there have been multiple times when I have been in line and the cashier will have not said one word to me (even when I say hi).   But I guess I am going there for food, not lively conversation, so I only subtracted one star for that."}
{"text":"As far as whole food is concerned.... psychology they would call this, the approach avoidance conflict. There are so many good things about this Whole Foods, yet the  bad are starting to gain in number. How is it that this store in Madison happens to not have many organic fruits,  A LOT of the time now?  And other stores do? Why have they not moved to a larger location, when obviously they need more room for parking, way more room in the isles and more organic fruits. Why don't they build one on the east side so people don't have to go as far and crowd up the west side store? And parking on certain days, forget it!  We are coming from Lake Mills to shop there. After living in Ca and going to the WF there, this store seems to be the smallest and the least stocked with items and internal restaurants...because of its size!!!  Who owns this place and why don't they move and expand????  I am agreeing with another writer here, it may be time to check out Woodmans, and I am indeed sad to have to say this.   Whole Food in Madison, are you listening to your customers?????"}
{"text":"As some reviews pointed out, they are classy and more expensive than your regular grocery stores, but every penny is worth it. A lot of the items they carry are organic produce, and their effort to cooperate with local farmers is unparallelled. They run great specials weekly so keep an eye out for their brochures in store or online, those can help you procure some good stuff at discounted prices.   My favorite section is the bakery. Simply love their bread -- baked fresh everyday. I like their huge variety of selection and how they keep the classic breads such as the italian white bread and whole wheat bread daily, and also having a selection of artisan breads that vary from day to day. For those of you not into surprises, don't worry, they have a 'menu' where they clearly state which breads they are baking on which day.  Their cakes, macarons and fruit tarts also have me hooked. It is the only place I get my whole cakes from. I like the moist texture of their cakes, and the level of sweetness -- not too sweet, not too bland either. Most of the cakes have fresh fruits and/or fresh cream on them. All these factors make their cakes uniquely right for me. If you are unsure, you can always give their sliced cakes a try first before getting them whole.   To be honest this is not the only place where I get my groceries. But once in a while when I am craving that premium ribeye, alaskan king crabs or other delicacies, I tend to splurge that much more =)"}
{"text":"Anyone who gives this place more than mediocre review is asleep.  I have been avoiding it for years, having visited several times when it first came here, finding it overpriced and over-hyped.  Nothing has changed.  Went there yesterday for two simple items.  Wife went in for a baguette and a pint of blueberries and paid $6.99 for same.  Turned out the twerp at the till charged us double for the blueberries.  Noted that same pint for which he charged us $4.00 cost exactly $4 for two pints at Woodmans, so how he got $4.00 for one pint I don't know.  Oh well, not worth returning for the contest.    Then we planned the baguette as part of our lunch.  It was flat out terrible.  Not only was it not even close to fresh, but it would have been lousy if it had been straight out of the oven, as it had no flavor at all.  It appears that these guys can fool at least some of the people some of the time."}
{"text":"Whole Foods,   Your convenient location can claim one of these five stars. Close to work, close to home. Personally, I think the parking you offer is plenty. No need to pave any more of that paradise.   The second star is for your selection and quality of the items in the cold and hot food stations. There are always plenty of veggie and healthy options. I appreciate this when I am in search of a healthy bite between meetings or on-the-go.   Third star is dedicated to your all-star bakery team, who prepare the most exquisite fruit and chocolate tarts.  Fourth star represents the wonderful community activities you plan for Madison. Bringing those of us interested in the more sustainable side of eating and living together.   And, the fifth and final star is for your reason for simply being, Whole Foods. I always know your merch will be certified organic and adhere to the highest possible standards of quality.   Thank you, Whole Foods : )  Victoria"}
{"text":"We have been shopping here for several years. At the stores we frequent in the Raleigh/Cary area we have always been satisfied with our visits. The employees are always helpful."}
{"text":"Oh, to have an unlimited food budget and endless blocks of time to cook...   I've become a fan of the store. I only shop here for special ingredients - yes, it's pricey - but I've always been very happy with my purchases. The bakery is fantastic and I've purchased a few really good items at the meat counter - the specialty burgers are good and there's usually at least one variety on sale on any given week.   The deli is stunning - great for anyone that's looking for pre-made dishes. Your tab will add up quickly if you buy a lot, but it's fun to try a small amount of the salad and side items for a treat."}
{"text":"What's special about this location is they carry the Kickapoo brand coffee!"}
{"text":"I love you, Madison Whole Foods.  The lady that sliced my meat was very down to earth and friendly.  I love going here.    My only complaint would be- I wish the store was even larger.  I too, am not crazy about the layout.  And yes, driving around that area is a bit of a headache.  We usually come from the west and then you have to sneak behind the building to get to the intersection when leaving.   The prices didn't seem unreasonable and the produce and flowers were fresh.    My husband loves the Whole Foods Brand shampoo.  You buy it in a large 32 container and it lasts him... a long time."}
{"text":"I've been shopping at Whole Foods in Madison for over 10 years now, and have always found it a very pleasant place. Their prices are not always the lowest, but since they often carry items (organic, ethnic, health etc.) not commonly available at other places, such comparisons are not always relevant. Staff is more helpful than most stores, and the overall experience is very positive. I particularly like the bakery, which might be the best in town. They also have a good selection of cheeses. I don't frequent the deli much but it seems fairly good for variety at least."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. The hot food was always good and fresh. The cold sandwiches were consistently delicious. Now, it's just a collection of shortcuts. The mac & cheese is watery. The Sonoma chicken salad has the most gigantic pieces of chicken, and the strange watery mayo they use just drips out of the tortilla. Ick. I don't know what happened, but quality control has gone downhill. Not a place I'll frequent anymore. Except maybe for the chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Quality is always top notch. What you pay is a little more but it is worth it."}
{"text":"I shopped more at whole foods when I was a little kid with my mom. Since the prices are higher we hadn't been back in a while. But today on my journey to find a certain health drink, I ended up entering this Whole Foods after a 5-8 year absence. It was a nostalgic feeling. The atmosphere is great. Although it's small, the place gives off a positive energy that makes you leave pleased and happy you stopped there. I highly recommend this place if you have a little more money to spend. Also great customer service, everyone had all smiles."}
{"text":"Having never been to a Whole Foods before, [I know, I KNOW!] I felt like it was high time to visit the notorious joint.  Basically, it's awesome.  Produce is pretty stellar, with great selections of everyday items at reasonable prices. I was expecting sky high markups for the organic fruits and veg, but was pleasantly surprised.  The staff is incredible, [some packers were helping me find some miso paste, and were the msot friendly guys ever!] and the store smells so good.  I want to try some brown rice sushi and the salad bar sometime!!!  Parking is a decent sized lot, but people were scrambling to find a space."}
{"text":"If Whole Foods was anywhere close to the realm of reasonably priced, they'd be an instant 5 stars in my book. I think the quality of the products they sell is excellent. I also have to eat a gluten-free diet, and they sell lots of tasty gluten-free baked goods of which I partake frequently. However, I could never afford to do my regular grocery shopping at Whole Foods. I know some pretty wealthy people who can't even afford Whole Foods. Why is is so expensive?!  Also, why is the parking lot so small?  Otherwise, Whole Foods is great."}
{"text":"Nice Whole Foods, friendly staff.  Always stop at WF when traveling for on the road salads."}
{"text":"This location is pretty small and definitely doesn't have a good wine selection. There is lots of local beer and the employees are all pretty friendly, especially in the bakery area. However, the clientele is so incredibly rude. I don't know what it is, but the people who shop here are so self centered that they can't even be troubled to say \"excuse me\" when they bump into you. The other huge drawback is that this Whole Foods doesn't deliver! They are really losing business because Metcalfe's, Hy-Vee and others deliver and have for awhile. I live in Chicago but my elderly parents live in Madison and it would be great if they could get Whole Foods products at their door. Maybe now that Amazon is buying Whole Foods, things will change."}
{"text":"This is a review on the prepared foods section.   I'm not a big fan. My biggest problem is that when I go there to have a meal at their store, because I want to eat healthy and knowing what the ingredients are important to me to ensure that I am indeed eating a healthy meal and because I do indeed have food allergies - there are no gosh darn trays! Can someone explain to me how I am supposed to carry a plate of food, maybe a small bowl of mixed greens with some toppings, my eating utensils, a drink, a napkin and maybe a desert? Am I supposed to balance this all on my head, or check things out one at a time? Very awkward - and the cherry on top of it all, is the guilt trip they lay on you as you are eating in their fine seating area, where they have all these different receptacle cans for different kinds of waste materials. Eating on the plate they provide is being the \"greenest\" of them all - and yet it's not encouraged when trays are not provided to help you carry such \"green\" plates over to your table. And oh yeah, the long hair that was in my food yesterday was quite gross - but I was so hungry and I am without a kitchen at the present moment, that food is food right now to me.   What is very confusing, too, is when you check out in line with all your plates, your drink, and pre-boxed desert items (which you really didn't want boxed because you are going to eat it in T-minus 15 minutes but were not given a choice in the matter) carefully arranged in a shopping basket - and then they start bagging things. Hello, cashier and bagger - did you not just see all the plates I am attempting to carry here? Can you not see that I am trying to avoid all the unnecessary packaging, so that I can have less of a guilt trip while I am eating and also feel good that I am doing something good for the environment? Apparently, not. Maybe they need to move the Guilt Trip sign to hang in front of the cashiers, so they can be reminded. Or is this Conscious Capitalism in the works? Hmmm - a thought to ponder. What is \"Quench with Respect\" supposed to mean, anyways?  In addition, they seem to think it is OK to use elastic bands on their food items, such as their rotisserie chicken. That's another big problem when one of the things I am allergic to is rubber. So if you have a rubber allergy - do not eat their rotisserie chicken. And if you like the taste of rubber chickens, by all means, dig in!  If you are eating out at Whole Foods, picking a desert - although, they are all really lovely - can be slim pickings. The pre-sliced cakes are refrigerated. Maybe this is great for long-time storage, but for the potential desert eater who wants to eat the cake right away, it's not so great and the full flavor of the cake cannot be enjoyed because the frosting is hard as a rock. Also, refrigerated creme brulee? Not such a great idea, either. They don't seem to really know the ingredients, too, of the items in the desert cases. (This is only a concern if you have food allergies I suppose - but it is a food store and they make the things on site (or do they?) - so shouldn't they know? If anybody has been to Gayle's in Capitola, CA - they have a binder with the ingredients for all their food products. Is it that hard to do?)"}
{"text":"Outstanding bakery, deli with prepared foods and superb butcher selections with homemade sausage. The produce is also of the highest quality. This is a fun store and a little pricey."}
{"text":"My go-to store for a host of specialty items.   Pros: Variety, friendly staff, fresh goods. Cons: It's crowded!!  Parking is getting more and more difficult.  And the store is tight on space.   I've shopped and eaten (deli, hot bar) at Whole Foods in NYC, DC, San Diego and those are all bigger and offer much more variety.  I'm hopeful Madison can catch up one of these days!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for deserts! The staff is friendly and very helpful, the lines move quickly, and they have a great deli area! I love that they sell local foods here and I wish we had one on East Side!!! I love buying salmon here whether it be fresh or frozen and a few other items. It's a bit pricey but you're paying for quality and that's all that matters. It's better to eat organic and local foods rather than the processed and imported foods. The less it travels the better! Anyway, this place is always buzzing with locals and stays pretty busy!! But they have plenty of staff members available to assist you with finding something or answering any questions you may have. I really like their herbal supplements and the Whole Foods brand works just fine. Their floral section is BEAUTIFUL!!! And it's always clean and neat in here!! Which is definitely a plus considering all of the traffic that goes through there!! I always stop by the bakery area to pick up a few gluten-free snacks for my kids! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A while back I had a pre-made sandwich here.  Tuna on raisin toast.  Hey, whatever I will give it a shot?  Pretty darn good!  So good I have come back just for it.  On my most recent visit I did not see one for sale and settled on a turkey on whole grain.  $5.99.  Ugh.  It was the most depressing item of food I can recall ever eating.  To call it bland is an insult to bland foods.  The bread was like cardboard (sorry to people that like to eat cardboard)  and the lettuce and tomato looked at least a day old.  After eating this sandwich I lost most of my faith in food of any kind.  After reading reviews here perhaps I should have just walked around for free samples.  I must admit the store is clean and they do have friendly employees if not the most dismal sandwich on Earth."}
{"text":"Well this is an interesting store. I don't come here a lot. It is a little expensive for my taste. I did leave with a couple things though like paper straw, a coconut bar, and Toms toothpaste.  They had a larger variety than Trader Joe's but the prices are a little higher.    The quality is higher than a regular grocery store but not everything is organic. Make sure to read the labels.  You can order almost anything in store from Amazon.com and it will be shipped to your house. A great option to use in winter."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that my only real complaint with this location is that the hot food section, to me, is lacking. The soups don't ever seem to be replenished anytime that I go and the rest of the hot food section doesn't have a ton of variety compared to other locations. That being said, I love the variety of grocery items and the rest of the store. Everyone who has helped me there has been very nice and friendly as well as knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Sorry, no.  Rude wannabee limousine hippies careening carts past (or through) if you don't move at their particular speed, horrible management, and ridiculous prices - $2 a pound higher on meats I've queried just today.  This overpricing is consistent across most of what Whole Paycheck offers.    There are far better sources in Madison.  Farmers' Market for one - you know, the guys WF purports to offer, all while buying \"organic\" by the ocean freighters-full from unknown, unchecked, sources in China?"}
{"text":"I love whole foods. And hello, you should totally check in here. I've gotten a LARGE tote bag and a regular tote bag (because the regular one ran out, they were nice enough to give me a LARGE one). HURRAY.  Free samples. lalalalala~~ so many cheeses, chips, and crackers, I can fill my tummy here. HAHAHA. not really.  And the all rounded deli, ready food. I LOVE the fruit tarts. WOOOHOOOO. 2 for $3.50, the small ones. And the big ones, are so good as birthday cake subtitutes! so good!!  I also like the sandwiches! mmmm tasty. haven't tried the rest yet.  And they have special events where they showcase some food. Last time in May they had a slow roasted pork and gave free samples to everyone, with coleslaw?  They also have the hippy brands which even Willy co-op doesn't have. Like back to nature crackers (YAY) and HUGE bottles of naked or odwalla juices. I LIKE that.  A nice, civilized groceries store for people who don't mind to pay a little more"}
{"text":"It's a Whole Foods. Not a lot to complain about here. Wish they'd de-bone the salmon better, though. Lost count of how many times I've nearly choked."}
{"text":"Great layout.  Easy to find items and great selection!  Love the salad buffet!!"}
{"text":"I hate food shopping period. I hate going even more, when you're surrounded by superficial hipsters n vegans (no offense). They have a huge selection of gf foods."}
{"text":"Realizing as I do the problems with this particular WFM location, I am still a fan. For those of us on the lower economic scale, it is pleasure just to walk around in WF and experiencing the pleasure of seeing beautiful produce, bakery and prepared foods.  That aside, how does anyone find a parking space on a weekend or after 5:30 pm? If you can walk, bus or bike, and are not planning to walk out with 2 or more bags, you will save yourself much grief. Besides, it gets awfully tight in the store itself on the weekends.  A big bonus is the quick grab meal area right next to the Hot Bar. Prepared salads, sandwiches, cheese/meat/cracker kits plus the raw ingredients for a meal are in a open refrigerated shelf unit for your perusal. If I didn't have the time or the inclination to look over the hot bar, I would definitely hit this. If I wanted to eat in, there are many opportunities here with the tremendous deli offerings, bakery and the hot/cold bar. Next time I stop in in the morning, I will definitely try the breakfast."}
{"text":"What an amazing Whole Foods experience! The new South Hills plaza (across from South Hills Village mall) is a beautiful additions looks like they anticipate bringing several more store fronts in.   Parking scores a 10/10. It is spacious and plenty of room to pull in and out of the lot unlike the East Liberty location. This location has a huge out door seating area perfect for a sunny day. Inside the store is beautiful organized complete with some special areas such as serve yourself home made pasta, fresh pressed juices and a matcha bar.   Today I picked up my usual items as I was there more to look around. I will be back to shop the wife arrange of wines and beers they have near the pre-made food section. It's the perfect space for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"In  a couple of words---it's ok.    The good: decent meat selection, their house brand 365 stuff is great, they have Kickapoo coffee, they carry Ecover products (hard to find), good bakery, suprisingly, some decent deals on occasion.    The bad: super small store, hard to move around in, tiny bulk area, fishy smelling fish (ick!), hard to get in and out of parking lot, not very good produce department, mostly expensive!    I stop in occasionally, but could never do actual grocery shopping here!  Last time I went the woman in front of me had 2 grocery bags and it was $96.  I think the best was the woman who had 3 bags of groceries and a watermelon and spent $326."}
{"text":"Pretty small and jam packed Whole Foods, but it's a Whole Foods and I've missed Whole Foods.   While I typically get irritated shopping here due to the prices there are a few specific things I must get at Whole Foods when I have the opportunity - their feta and pita. From their deli and food bar I must get  their japanese tofu and cucumber sesame noodles.  Also, Crispin cider, which most locations seem to carry.   Staff was nice and friendly here.  They did not have burrata cheese, which sucked, but I found it elsewhere in Madison.  All in all, nice little Whole Foods."}
{"text":"This was one of the smaller WFM that I have been to.  However, I believe that view point is heavily influenced by living in the Bay Area.  Everything about this location is paired back.  The hot and cold food section.  The selection of specialty soda and chocolate.  However, the key items are the same.    What did I learn today?  From the lady in front of me, a single back of groceries $107 and change.  Ouch!!"}
{"text":"I shop here several x a month and must say their neat seafood fresh fishes are all excellent! I love their bakery too their bread they make there daily! And its cheaper than Giant Eagle Market district. But my fav is their puzzas by whole or slices. I live their mushroom one and Everything on it. A nice place to sit and eat a slice in a clean atmosphere. And now w Amazon Lockers too! Try their meat better thanG Eagle and cheaper too! Check their ads on Flipp App They are still my fav store I love Siggis yoghurt and its cheaper there than GEagle for it too!"}
{"text":"I have been a Whole Foods shopper for years, however the Madison Whole Foods is making search for new options. :(    First - it is much too small. Why hasn't WF corporate gotten their act together and bought/built a bigger store in the Madison area??  Madison is full of people who want to eat well - and this tiny store, which has been here forever, is just not cutting it.  Trying to maneuver around the produce section is kind of like playing Pac-Man - you have to keep changing directions until you finally find a way out, because there isn't room for more than a single cart in any of the sections.  Trying to get around with a couple of kids + your cart??  Insanity.   Second - because it is tiny, they just don't have any many great options that other Whole Food locations have. I was spoiled by living in IL within a 20 minute drive of 3 different WF stores, all of which were bigger with better selections of both packaged and fresh products. I know I have high standards, but I think the people of Madison deserve a little more!!  Finally, the last time I went, I was sorely disappointed in the number of organic produce options, in fact, I think I found a bag of organic apples. That was IT. No organic strawberries, blueberries, or bananas, which should really be a given. While I appreciate the high standards the Whole Foods uses to select its produce providers, I would still rather go to Metcalf's or the Co-op and get the organic variety.    The saving grace of this Whole Foods is its super friendly and helpful employees. Because I am new to the area, I still inevitably get stuck finding at least one thing every time I go.  Each time a personable employee has helped me locate exactly what I was looking for. The check out people and baggers are always incredibly friendly.  I even had the nicest woman EVER help me get my bags into my car one of those crazy -20 days in the middle of winter, in spite of me assuring her I was okay.  The service there is truly wonderful.   Sadly, however, I think my time as an exclusive WF shopper are over unless the powers that be decide to find a bigger, better location for the Madison area."}
{"text":"You head to Whole Foods when you have disposable income.  It's referred to as \"whole paycheck\" for a reason, y'all.  Sure there are masses of old-money elderly, hipsters and hippies,  but don't make eye contact and you'll be just fine.  Their standard grocery is fine except that many of the products can be found at Woodmans for 1/2 the price. Also, their soda brand is Zevia, which is a Stevia-based soda -- it is the most revolting/mediciney/bile-aftertasty soda I've consumed.  The real reason to come is for their deli and bakery (especially).  Everything I've had in their deli is delicious.  Of course it'll cost you at least $9/lb.  My \"go to\" is the Roman Tuna Salad - outrageously good.  Pass on the chicken parm - it's stupidly expensive and only slightly above average.  The belle of the frickin' ball is the bakery.  Each item contains choice ingredients, applies the best recipe and is always baked to perfection.  Mind-altering experiences come from eating their fruit tart or cheesecake.  Each are good enough to hug a nearby hipster, hippy and (carefully hug) a wealthy elderly person.    The only item I tried on a lark because I knew wouldn't work in that setting was the creme brulee -- it was very tasty, but the top did not have the satisfying snap/crackle/pop as your spoon dives in."}
{"text":"This whole foods is pretty good! It is a little small, but there are always a ton of free samples out. I'm always happy when I leave this store! They have a nice selection of beers too. It is terrible getting into the store if you are coming from campus. The U-turns are a nightmare! Whole foods, please use your hippie clout and get a turn lane put in to access the parking lot."}
{"text":"Honestly not overly impressed. A lot of the things that I go to Whole Foods for -the fresh vegan burgers the tempeh and a few other things they don't have. They've just opened and they're not as big as the one in Wexford so obviously not going to have the same amount of stock . but there was very little there that I couldn't get it Giant Eagle for a lot less. I may come back in a couple of months when they're really up and running so I'll reserve my judgment for now."}
{"text":"Nice to have one nearby as it increases my property value.  Too expensive to shop there and I am struggling to find an off brand that is price competitive.  Also, the local Market District has raised their prices on private label organics to be 10c less than the WF private label and that pisses me off."}
{"text":"Fact is,  Whole Foods is really expensive. Period. They do have a really good bakery, and their pizza is decent. I also like it for salad greens and other vegetables that are hard to find in the regular grocery stores. However, a brand of ricotta cheese that is sold in *regular* everyday grocery stores where I am from,  cost me more than twice as much at Whole Foods here in PA. Seriously.  I bought it as a taste of home, but won't do so again.  Customer service was fine, but I won't shop here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"So small!! Was my first thought, as it is just a one level little whole foods, but inside there is plenty. Now Whole Foods is one of my favorite stores. You know you are buying quality products from good sources. I go there for the vegan options. There was not as great a selection as Id hoped but I still got plenty of snacks. I got a meal from the warm food section too. I was happy to see cakes from chicago diner! The chilled meal section only had a vegan tamali.... I really was looking for the chickn wraps. Oh well. Overall it was good. Friday night was super busy."}
{"text":"I have only been to this particular whole foods twice, and it is likely that I will not return! I like whole foods in general, however this particular store has employees who seem to think they are inconvenienced by doing their job.  The first time I went, a lady left her disgusting coffee cup on the check out counter(where I would need to place my items). This second time, while checking out the cashier asked for \"a little help unloading the basket\" which is only appalling because there was no one in line in front of or behind me.  I actually normally unload the basket (which btw had all of 5 items in it), but I figured I'd save us both time by allowing her to do her job without waiting for me to go through the unnecessary steps. She proceeded to slam my receipt down on the counter rather than put it in the bag or simply hand it to me. Disappointing. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This store is much nicer than East Liberty.  It's larger, had better parking, and the prepared food selection and pub are great!  I love that we can buy wine and beer in the grocery stores in PA now and they had a nice selection.  You can get mixed sixes, bomber size bottles, or six packs of a pretty good assortment.  They have some neat local things in the store that would make for cool gifts.  Eat at the 1788 Pub.  The prices are incredibly reasonable, portions filling but not enough for leftovers, and most importantly the food was good.  I had the catfish.  Since I live about half way in between East Liberty and the new location, I will be visiting the South Hills store more often."}
{"text":"If you're a Whole Foods cashier and chatting with the next lane's bagger about you leaving for the day, and you say, \"I'm gonna be outta here, mother f*cker,\" perhaps you shouldn't say that in front of your customer. And perhaps you should actually say \"thank you\" when you hand the customer her receipt instead of continuing your chat with your coworker.  Just a thought.  And if you're the Whole Foods bagger who just finished bagging the customer's items, maybe you should acknowledge the customer as she leaves ... instead of the customer saying \"thank you\" to see if you'll respond.  Just a thought.  I'm not sure if I'm the only one, but when I go to Whole Foods, I feel like my presence is a burden and an annoyance to the staff. They seem to not want to deal with customers.   I understand Whole Foods is a niche store. And even though I'm shopping there and I'm a 20-something female, I still expect the same level of customer service and professionalism as a super-conservative little old grandma would expect.  The employees at Woodman's are super friendly to me and always professional. I shop in the organic/natural aisles at my local Woodman's every week. I will continue to do that and make my Whole Foods visits not so frequent."}
{"text":"Beautiful store, adequate parking, large selection of whole delicious foods. They have a nice cafe with sushi and beer and hot yummy foods and a rather large selection of wines. The layout of the store is kind of confusing, but it works. The produce at Whole Foods, in general, is one of the reasons why I am a repeat customer.. it's always so fresh and the selection is unbeatable from organic to locally grown, they got it all. This location is awesome overall- I am a more frequent customer to the East Liberty location because it's closer to my work, but I do enjoy coming here when I'm in the South Hills."}
{"text":"Don't... like... it........   Why can't they make prepared food that tastes good. They have access to all ingredients and overcharge for crap."}
{"text":"Smaller version of a tried and true chain grocery store. Employees have always been super friendly. This store will not disappoint fans of the Whole Food market."}
{"text":"Been here quite often ever since it's opened so I decided that it's only right to give my thoughts on it!  The store is very clean & very spacious compared to the one in East Liberty. If you have time and go there on one of the weekdays like me,  you'll probably find a parking spot on the main level. If not there's a big parking lot on the lower level. I've been there on a Sunday early afternoon and the parking was an absolute nightmare. Just by making a turn to the store was already bad enough that day. Never again. Just like many of the reviewers have already said, I love the juice/smoothie bar right when you walked in and their meat department is super fresh as well.   Overall I'm happy we finally have a Whole Foods on the South Hills area, we definitely needed one for a long time!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting for a long time for this store to open! It was worth the wait! It's so nice to have one in the south hills now. With a coffee bar when you walk on, the freshest produce, in store butcher, awesome seafood, great pub and one of the best salad bars ever! The bakery has fresh bread made daily in store, sweets and great cheese and meats. The produce is some of the most diverse anyway, homemade quac, fresh squeezed orange juice and tons of other store made goodies! Yeah, you may pay a little more than shop n save, but you will find the food healthy, fresh and all the choices you want. Oh yeah, and beer and wine!!"}
{"text":"This location is only okay as far as Whole Foods Markets go. The store is cramped and most of the staff are unfriendly (except for those working the deli counter-they are always a helpful smiley bunch!). Parking can be a bit of a hassle despite the fact they have their own parking lot. Selection is fair. Most of the times I visit the vast majority of the produce section is conventional. Organic pickings are usually slim. The prepared foods are where they really shine. I prefer the local co-op for most of my grocery shopping but a few of my favorite deli salads keep me coming back. Try the brussel sprout kale slaw! Deceptively delicious. They have a surprising variety of bulk trail mixes. Also, they carry Stumptown coffee products. Hooray!"}
{"text":"So cute! Love how the local WF reflect the local flavor of the town and region.  Layout: one side \"health and health beauty products and foods\", other side regular whole foods.  Cheese section is making me drooooool (native Wisconsinite wishing to dear God the rest of the country had cheese like this).  No hummus? Huh? I could find a store-made BEAN DIP, but isn't hummus a bean dip, essentially? Maybe peeps here don't like it. Probably because its cool and refreshing, and with so many \"cool and refreshing\" days in Madison (read: butt cold), maybe hummus doesn't, er, cut the cheese.  I also get the pico de gallo at every WF I go to. Can we talk, endearingly, about Midwestern BLAND. Got enough ONIONS and TOMATOES in that MILD salsa? There wasn't a jalapeno in sight. Isn't it cute? Yes, but it's also realistic. Wisconsinites don't need to induce sweating through food. Sweating is considered dirty up here. Let's keep it to 70 degrees, you guys.  Also, the beer section may kick every other WF ass. (Beer and cheese, they do it right here)."}
{"text":"I don't live \"close\" to a Whole Foods (I'm south side Indy-they are north side Indy), but I go when I need some quinoa or to grab some lunch if I am in the area. I needed some quinoa, was driving by, so I stopped, even though I am not from Madison. With the Yelp check in you get a free small bag. .They were out of the small, so I got the next size up. Yay! I would have even paid the $.20 difference. Yay for good customer service!!!"}
{"text":"It's expensive, it's classist, it's overwhelmingly mat salleh, wai lo, haole, all that.  It's also never never ever disappointed me when it comes to the produce section. On my way to buy most of my groceries at a cheaper place I stop at Whole Foods for the produce, and the white cheddar popcorn.   Honey crisp apples are excellent, sweet, juicy, firm and not grainy. Excellent. The mandarin oranges are great, the grapes sweet and refreshing, and they carry Pomelo fruit. They also carry fresh turmeric root, lemon grass, and various peppers and chilis. They let you taste many of their different produce selections, and their guacamole is decent.   The rest of the store? I have no idea."}
{"text":"They have a lot of great food items . My pet peeve is no military or senior citizens discount. At least Giant Eagle's gives veterans and police officers a free coffee. This is 4 July holiday weekend. Where is the love?"}
{"text":"Your seafood manager  Kim  was very friendly, kind and helpful. He went out of his way for me this morning.  He really made my day!"}
{"text":"Wish I had a millions dollars to shop here for EVERYTHING!  Someday I will, until then I will go for the fruits,veggies and overall awesome meat choices!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewer who said that from the outside, it is nothing special to look at. I passed it actually driving down rt 19. I had to turn around. They could've done something more eye catching... like have the main entrance face the highway.....   Anyways despite that, inside is very nice. The cheese, meat, deli, pizza, sushi and prepared foods on the far right have very good looking food displayed. The workers were all extremelyyy kind and eager to help or answer questions. The meat department had the most amazing freshest meat ive ever seen.   We sampled a few things such as pizza (delicious sauce) and honey, from a local grower.   Parking was intense. There was legit traffic to get into here. We waited our turn in traffic and thankfully parking lot attendants were on top of their job and did excellent with the crowd control. Sounds crazy saying crowd control... But the parking lot was jammed packed with crunchy moms searching for organic produce.   Go during off times while its still new."}
{"text":"A very pretty natural food establishment.  I'm not crazy about the kind of cramped layout, which really is inconvenient, considering how many people are always there.  Still, it's usually a nice experience.  They have some of the best produce available in Madison (and also the most expensive).  When I made Beef Wellington one day, they were the only place that had truly gorgeous-looking cuts of Fillet Mignon (again, expensive).    The really nice thing about Whole Foods is the \"Whole Foods brand.\"  This allows you to buy things at a reasonable price.  :)  I also am a big fan of their take-out/deli foods.  Mmmm, good..."}
{"text":"Very nice store. But I will not be returning I am a vegan and I was extremely excited about it as it was being built since there weren't many options for me in the area. I went for the first time today and first off let me tell you the store apon walking in is beautiful and clean.. and everyone was super friendly. But let me just get down to what this review is  about. In the back you have a very open glass wall butcher shop with hanging carcasses of pigs... and I am a very tolerant person.. but if that wasn't bad enough that it's in the middle of the store and un avoidable... it was rite across the isle from the vegan selection. I have never had a miserable experience shopping. But I did today.. and I won't be able to return until this issue is fixed. I called Corporate and I haven't had a response. I am part of the vegan forum  for Pittsburgh. And almost everyone feels the same way as I do. I really hope this is something that can be fixed EDIT:  They did move the vegan section down so it isn't directly across from the hanging carcasses.. so now I am able to navigate around the store to avoid it so I gave them more stars"}
{"text":"My appreciation for the quality of their food continues to grow.   The flavor of the steaks for instance blows other grocers out of the water.   Sure you can pay less for steak elsewhere but you will also pay in flavor and meat quality.  We buy one delicious steak here for 20 dollars instead of buying two mediocre steaks down the road for 24 dollars and have a much better dinning experience. Be cautious on the serve yourself buffet.  I think the price per pound is 6.99 or 7.99  but not sure.  What I find is that a full tray will be about 12.50 and this is way too much for what you get.  Especially for the rice or salad greens.  Think about it... 7.99/lb for rice? Salad greens?  That's crazy.    Great selections and some terrific food but just be careful as you shop.  The deli.  We don't care for it.   How do you mess up broccoli salad?  They did, we threw it away.  Some of spinach dishes have been ok.  Way too expensive.  The cheese section.  Awesome.   We buy cheese here all the time.  Lots of great chocolate bars and other chocolates.  Look for it and buy some.  Yum.  The WF 360 brand is usually quite good for every product we have purchased.  The meat continues to please.  Always delicious.    Service.   People could be friendlier.  Not sure why this is because we like the vibe of the store but the one on one in the store and at the checkout feels stilted sometimes.  It would be worthwhile for the store to look into this.   At some other groceries we find people are much more relaxed, happy to see you, willing to talk about other things than what you are buying.  Update 2017:  Impersonal at the check-out.  What gives?  I thanked the bagger and barely got an acknowledgement.  I might start shopping elsewhere just because of this crappy indifference at the check-out.  Guys in the seafood/meat department were super friendly.  So that saved the day,,,,  I dropped one star for the continual decline in friendliness."}
{"text":"Only a three star for me.  I understand the importance of this store to our community.  They have a nice selection of items.  But, as long as that store has been there, it needs a make-over.  The store itself is tooooooo small.  The isles are awful.  People rush past you, don't move or just stop right in front of you.  All because there is nowhere to go.  Bigger store, bigger selection, bigger isles.  Of course, this is just my opinion."}
{"text":"I haven't been here since they remodeled. My memories are of a smallish store. It's a typical Whole Foods with all the goodies. 'Nuf said."}
{"text":"I live right next to it so I shop here very often. The produce and fruits are guaranteed fresh. The selection of cheese is very good and they have many different varieties. They let you sample cheese too! All you need to do is ask. Some times they have special expensive cheese on discount. I got the truffle cheese for just around $7. The baked goods and breads are very delicious. The cakes and desserts are not too sweet or sour. My favorite is the fruit tart. They have a wide range of wines. I see a lot of deals going on all the time. One of the most convenient things about Whole Food is that they have hot food like breakfast, lunch and dinner and a dining area where you can sit down and enjoy your food. The food is a bit over priced but it is definitely good quality. I usually shop flowers here too because some time they have deals where it is only $4 for a bouquet of tulips. But overall the flowers are very beautiful and a bouquet is relatively big"}
{"text":"I love this place and all the delicious fresh food, but I can barely afford any of it! I have to keep coming here though, because they stock the most amazing raspberry tart cheese, which I haven't been able to find elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice atomosphere, pretty good food and products except for the hamburger from the meat case which is disgustingly fatty crap.  Some of the workers look like sasquatch behind the deli cases, and that could make a person think twice about having them touch your food.  I think they are trying to do the whole, \"I'm a neo-hippy, anti-establishment, going green dude, so I don't wash my dreadlocks or anything else on my body for six months at a time, and for deodrant I rub rocks on my pits!\" thing.    On the flip side, its fun to cruise the store for free samples and it's nice to have a place to purchase products that don't have lead or mercury in them!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch  Took 30 minutes to receive tacos and breakfast meal.   Other customers in next booth said their meal took a long time to come.   Would not recommend if you need to get on with your day.   Cutting into my grocery shopping time.   Not happy."}
{"text":"I can't help it.  I'm going to have to disagree with the other people who reviewed Whole Foods, even the one I happen to share a house with.  I love everything in this place starting and ending with the samples.  Did you know that if you ask an employee about a particular food they are allowed to open it for you to try?  Best tip ever."}
{"text":"I'm only going to be reviewing their hot bar, as this is a grocery store! I come here often to get some delicious and nutritious to-go meals or to eat them at their cafe area.  I do honestly believe they have one of the best hot bars for a grocery store. As long as you don't overload your plate with mounds of food, it's definitely affordable. And they always have a sufficient amount of dishes to choose from, never leaving you with boring options.  Their cafe/seating area is also a GREAT place to study, surprisingly... I came here to study for my life insurance license, and the amount of noise was just the perfect level - enough so that it keeps your ears busy, but not too loud so that you can't concentrate. The only times you have to be aware of is when large groups of people come in to eat or if there is a mom with her child. But other than that, perfect noise control!"}
{"text":"Bought local chocolate  Gail Ambrosious chocolate truffles here.  From Gail or Willy St. It's 22.00.  Here?  26.99.  Wow, 25% markup after retail????  Whole paycheck."}
{"text":"Some common truths: 1)  The parking lot will be full of either hybrids or Subarus.  Most will sport a bumpersticker of Hope/Unite/Coexist yet the customers driving these cars really don't embrace these philosophies (as they are some of the most snootiest (is that a word?) in town) 2)  Most of the customer's are wearing some sort of patagonia jacket/keen footwear and they all believe in layering.   3)  You will leave the store wondering, \"How can this little amount of stuff be sooo expensive?\"  With that said, I believe Whole Foods has one of the best fish counters in town.  The mongers are well informed and happy to help.  As well, there deli case and prepared foods won't leave you disappointed. I especially love their Israeli couscous with cranberries...seriously addicting.  Cheese selections are pretty on point with a good selection of international cheeses.  As long as you come into the store knowing what you want to get (vs. general grocery shopping), you will fare well.  Just remember to leave that Bush/Quayle '88 shirt at home if you don't want to face the stare of death of everyone and their mother while shopping....."}
{"text":"Whole Foods market is a great place to stop by for breakfast, lunch or dinner! They have a lot of healthy options there. It is very pricey, even the food as well. I would give this 5 stars but the dining area was just a mess and should be better kept up throughout the day. Yes we understand people make a mess, but if spilled water is all over the ground from the time I sat down and finished my meal (30mins) that's a safety problem (there's a kids section to play in the dining area). Other then that, employees seemed to be very extra going and happy. I would come again but maybe not to sit down and eat."}
{"text":"I know Whole Foods has that reputation, but I like to spread my grocery dollar around to various places, and there are some things I really love about Whole Foods. First, it's my go to place for my addiction item, fresh-squeezed O.J. I often pick up just that on a trip there. But I also like their prepared deli foods (Spanakopita, salads,) the salad bars, and the bakery. None of these are particularly expensive, except the O.J. They also have a great selection of cheeses, and featured types with samples can be had for around $5.00. For the $7-10.00 you were going to spend at McDonald's, you can make yourself a very nice, healthier lunch here for the same $$. My favorite $5.00 lunch special is a nice chunk of Spinach Pie from the deli, and an iced tea. Many of the 365 organics cost no more than similar items in other stores. The meat and seafood department also has specials on such items as sockeye salmon or uncured (I trust that doesn't mean still sick!) bacon. Then there's that olive bar. Nom, nom! And the Whole Foods equivalent of three-buck Chuck, which I've found to be tasty.. The staff at this store are very friendly and helpful, especially the checkout folks. I don't do  my big shopping here, You just need to be a bit of a sleuth to find the good values."}
{"text":"This is a great Whole Foods.  Especially noteworthy is their large and thoughtful selection of artisanal cheeses from Wisconsin (the chevre is amazing).  Love the baked-in-Madison Potter's crackers.  The salad bar is good but not as well stocked as other Whole Foods.  The bakeshop is good and has items from local bakers. The parking lot is a disaster and a danger to other drivers and pedestrians."}
{"text":"Love this new Whole Foods! I had to stop by South Hills Village Mall and just happened to spot the store across the street as I was exiting the Target parking lot. It definitely meets the standard that you expect when walking into a Whole Foods. I also thought it may be a bit larger than the other Pittsburgh locations (East Liberty and Wexford) and less crowded. If I lived close by, I'd be tempted to stop here several times/week!"}
{"text":"+ WIFI!!! + a few items were surprisingly well priced- coffee for $5.99, PB for $2.69, luna bars for $.99.... + conveniently located near my rental apt + wasn't stuck waiting too long on checkout line + not too crowded in aisles + cranberry walnut rolls... always so good  - weak salad bar options - crazy priced sweet potatoes ($2.49/lb!)... steep prices for produce in general (no apples or peaches/nectarines for less than $2.99/lb), as well as milk and cream"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and everything appears to be fresh.  Especially the seafood."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh finally has a Whole Foods worthy of the phrase \"City of Champions\"!  I had heard that this Whole Foods had finally opened about being under construction for what seemed like several years. I was in the area so I decided to stop by. The worst thing about the visit was the parking lot...it's a complete mad house! They definitely under estimated the footprint for this store, especially after this area has been CRAVING a Whole Foods for so long.  But then... you walk inside into this beautiful, airy, window-filled building. Yes, it's basically a giant warehouse, but this giant warehouse has floor to ceiling windows, an abundance of fresh food to go, a pasta, and even a sushi bar...rivaling those in New York City. While in the store I was transported back to Columbus Circle, brimming with excitement to check out all my favorite items.  The more explored, the more I couldn't wait to plan my next visit. Need a specialty item? Check. Looking for a special dinner to go with dinner? Check. How about some freshly rolled sushi on your next date night? Check check.   Employees were very friendly. All in all great experience. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Yeah, this is an expensive place to shop in general, but it's because of the nature of what they sell, not because they charge a lot. If you find the exact same slightly unusual packaged product at a \"regular\" store it will cost 25% less at Whole Foods. Local artisan cheeses cost less at Whole foods.  Soeaking of local cheese, this has one of the best cheese counters around. They are less likely to be out of in-demand cheeses like the seasonal Rush Creek Reserve, and it will be cheaper there.   I would not go there for normal shopping, it's really for less common stuff like fresh figs or dried seaweed.   Produce quality is exceptional.  The bakery, surprisingly can be really hit or miss. The baguettes can be  like Wonder bread inside."}
{"text":"While I agree with people who call it \"Whole Paycheck,\" and that many of the items are overpriced, WFMM has a wide selection of unusual, organic, non-GMO certified, and special-diet options (vegan in the house, what up). Plus, the Madison store has the SWEETEST classes. Seriously, have you seen them? Cooking classes, beer tastings, henna tattoo workshops... check it (http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/events?store=6611)  Last but not least, bicycle benefits members receive $5 off $30 in groceries. Now THAT'S something I can get behind."}
{"text":"I received a flyer in the mail a few days ago from Whole Foods, and on the cover, as well as the first page inside, there are photos featuring swordfish (harpoon-caught, fresh not frozen).  The flyer is dated June 27th thru July 10th.  I stopped in today specifically with swordfish being my goal to cook for some guests tonight.  The fish monger tells me, that was last week's ad, we have no swordfish today.  I told him it was on the monthly flyer that comes in the mail, and he knew nothing about it.  I wished I would've had the flyer with me so I could've shown it to him.  On my way out of the store, I also stopped at the service desk to ask them if they had a copy of it, and they said they never see those flyers, but that all of their sales run weekly.  They were clueless about it.  Now I have to come up with an alternate dinner plan.  Also, ever since Amazon took over, this Whole Foods has gotten worse.  The produce isn't as nice as it used to be, and also, several items that I used to frequently purchase are now discontinued or were out of stock today.  How can you be out of whole wheat hot dog buns the day before 4th of July weekend?  Why was there no breakfast food in the hot bar this morning?  Why did the bakery discontinue single serve hoagie sticks?  I could go on about some other items also, but I am sure you're tired of reading my rant.  Can I get some cheese to go with my whine?!?!?!   :("}
{"text":"A small store by WFM standards but a decent selection nonetheless.  Meat department and cheese counter are the clear winners, prepared foods good as well.  Produce leaves something to be desired.  The staff is friendly and consists of the typically eclectic Whole Foods bunch.  They tried to build a bigger store in 2006 but the economic crisis stopped them.  Hope they resurrect those plans.  A little trivia - they only Whole Foods to ever go union, albeit briefly.  Also I'm surprised that many people who live in Madison don't know there is a Whole Foods.  My opinion is that Whole Foods and the coop can coexist."}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love this place! But what's with all the tattoos and facial piercings on the people behind the cash registers? It appears as a requirement, if you want to work there. Not very professional."}
{"text":"I braved the masses and visited Whole Foods Market on opening day. I waited until an hour before closing. It was still packed. However I was on a mission. I wanted to purchase the Honey Crisp Apples on sale for 1.99 a pound. What a fantastic sale price. I was also after Halo Top ice cream. It is normally $6-$7 a pint but they were running it for 2 for $7. The best part was the choice of flavors they had. I texted my friends who love Halo Top and let them know about all of the flavors.  The store itself is an OCD person's (me) dream come true. Everywhere you looked all of the items were lined up and sometimes colorized. It made everything appealing to the eye. As crazy as it was, the employees were kind and helpful.  The cafe was packed but it just may be my new place to meet people for coffee or juice. We treated ourselves to a cup of Sunshine juice on our way out. It seriously was a tasty cup of sunshine. I can't wait to go back and really look at everything once it's less crowded. Al. Of the customers kept saying how excited they were to have a Whole Foods in their area. I agree."}
{"text":"Whole Foods is one of my favorite grocery stores! They have an awesome selection of different foods, organic foods and fresh meat/seafood. The Seafood is some of the freshest in Madison. I wish they had one of the east side of Madison."}
{"text":"The best breads in the town! I love the European style bread, and Whole Foods makes them just so perfect and delicious. I love their \"unwheetable wheet bread\" is just done right :)  A lot of people think that everything is expensive at Whole Foods, but that's not true. Sales items and their own brand basics (can of beans etc) are at good values (and natural and organic and all the things CA people crave)."}
{"text":"Whole Foods is still a novelty for me.  I like to shop here but generally only buy items I can't get elsewhere.  I like to get fresh juice at the juice bar or self serve orange juice press, I like the fresh noodles, the selection of nuts and grains, fresh vegetables like tumeric that I can't get elsewhere, and I like that I can use Android pay to pay."}
{"text":"I was craving something light and decided I was in the mood for some sushi after walking around looking at the options. I got a spicy shrimp roll and a chocolate cream desert. To start with the roll I guess it's what you would expect from a chain establishment. There was two people on sight preparing everything and they had a motto saying \"made today served today\" but it didn't taste the freshest. It did have a small crunch and putting more soy sauce did make it taste better but I don't think I'll be having that again. As for the chocolate it was very rich, fluffy and creamy. The shell it's self was hard and had a great snap to it. I would recommend trying it to a friend."}
{"text":"A little expensive but well worth the drive coming here. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Bonus: They treat their employees well. Good benefits + sustainable living wage = good place to vote with your dollars."}
{"text":"I really like this Whole Foods! It is around the corner from the hotel I always stay at when in Pittsburgh and it is my go-to whenever I need to grab anything healthy to eat or snacks to buy while driving to/from the Midwest or to have in my car. I love that this WF isn't too big or too small so it isn't overwhelming and I can find anything I need here."}
{"text":"Might not be as big as others, but they do alright by me.   Their connection to the community and local farmers is extensive given that they're so corporate, and the staff I've encountered has always been friendly and helpful. Their hot bar can't be beat if you need a quick lunch and they have some killer bottles of vino expertly priced. I agree with Bobb S that it has some serious fishy offerings and if you're ok paying a premium for great beef, that stuff rocks too!"}
{"text":"I hate how much I love whole foods, because it can really dig a hole in my wallet. That being said, I will not deduct a star for price because whole foods does not claim to be a cheap/value grocery store.  This particular location has great service and is spacious and well organized. I was especially impressed with how helpful the people who work in the supplements/medicine section were. They went above and beyond to find some information for me regarding one of the products they sell, and their general knowledge of what they carried and what certain products are used for was very impressive.  Honestly, not that different from most other whole foods, same great store with awesome service! Oh, and don't forget to get free samples!"}
{"text":"OMG it's so tiny! I've never been in a Whole Foods so small. Is there an upstairs that I missed? Because it's so small it's always crowded, the coffee is always empty and the selection isn't quite that of other locations (especially the floral department which is usually outstanding at Whole Foods but at this location is pretty dismal) BUT they still have outstanding merchandise and I did make a new discovery the last time I was there of a new favorite product. But honestly, I think I'll stick to Metcalfe's."}
{"text":"Have stopped in a few times for Happy Hour at 1788 Cafe.  First the pros - good beer and decent wine selection and $1 off during Happy Hour.  The food is OK.  The place was full and we managed to get 4 seats at the bar after a few minutes of waiting.  The cons - service was very underwhelming and slow.  We split a fish sandwich special for $10 that was good and the Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts that were very spicy and while I liked them you really could not taste any brussel sprout.  The crowd was a good mix with families and couples.  However, one family needs to work on inside voices for the kids and adults.  Another women was so load and yelling when ordering you could hear her over all the noise and then from behind us to get drink refills.  When we were leaving another couple mentioned that person too.  I know WFM has no control over the guests but wow, come on people!"}
{"text":"The store is getting worse instead of better.  A number of the items in prepared foods that my wife gets are slowly disappearing leaving us to go to East Liberty or Wexford if we want them which is crazy as this store is 5 mins from our house.  I can't understand why the other locations have no issue stocking these items.  I can't see us shopping here much longer especially with Trader Joes, Market District, and Fresh Market being so close."}
{"text":"Came here to grab breakfast after exercising. Their smoothie bowls are delicious! I had the acai bowl, which had peanut butter and acai smoothie with banana, granola, and blueberries on top. It was delicious and very reasonably priced at $7. The store is also huge and has a great selection of everything. I am a fan of their hot foods section and cheese selection as well."}
{"text":"Can I give 0 stars? Sat at the pub for 20 minutes with employees buzzing around us and zero acknowledgement of our existence.   Get more staff , get friendlier staff.  Seriously . RUDE.  Get your stuff together Whole Foods !!!"}
{"text":"I like it!  If you haven't been to this particular location in the last few years, they have done renovations to improve store flow and number of items stocked.  Butcher case is OK,  I'm surprised that relatively few meats are \"hippie meats\" (ie--grass fed, no cage, highest standards of animal welfare).  I guess you still have to buy frozen at the farmer's market in Madison for that.  You won't find any particularly unusual cuts here (no chicken feet, backs, or salt pork)  Cheese section: Good, Wisconsin cheeses are mixed in with international cheeses for those who demand to know source of origin.  Fruits and veg: Always lookin good, as is true of most Whole Foods.  Keep your eyes peeled for the excellent guacamole.  Supplements & Beauty: Have no idea what's in this aisle, has a crapton of stuff. Most of it seems to have Vitamin C, D, or Homeopathy.  Frozen food: Relatively few frozen foods available. Unsure if this is because there aren't as many organic frozen foods as conventional frozen foods.  Prepared foods: Hot bar, salad bar, $7.99/lb. A little known fact: at breakfast they have oatmeal, scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, bacon, and breakfast tacos.  The oatmeal is really good because you can add blueberries, almonds, and dried fruits. The hot food bar closes about an hour before closing.  Deli: Sliced cheeses and meats open until close, rare in many grocery stores!  The house deli meat is very good.  Cannot speak for the other prepared foods behind the deli case.  Bakery: DELICIOUS, pricy side, the sweet baked goods are excellent, as for the savory baked goods, the baguette is not THE best in town (Batch!) but tasty, and the Seedlicious bread is awesome.  Did you know that you can get a refund for any reason with the food packaging and a receipt within 30 days?  Awesome in case you get something that just doesn't work out.  If you've been to a GIGANTIC whole foods store with 20 different soups and a gelato bar, you may be disappointed.  For Dane County area, it's good, and my go-to when I want something to eat quickly without stopping in a restaurant, as well as their yummy fresh guacamole."}
{"text":"This is your typical WF. I was bribed to come here through a Yelp check in offer. Not a great one but when there are a lot of options for grocers in the area it makes a difference.   The offer was for a free small tote and they only had a full size. Customer service was nice enough and they allowed me to have it.   Their prices on meats are ridiculously higher compared to similar stores. Prices on non organic produce are also higher.  WF has a few specialty products that some other stores of the similar line don't carry and that would be the only reason that I would go back."}
{"text":"This is a dual review. The first part will focus on Whole Foods. The second part will  focus on 1788 Pub inside the store.  Part one. Arriving on opening day the place is packed but they do have guides leading you to park.  The lot is not overly big but I was directed to an inside basement parking where I was able to secure a spot. By the time I left they were directing traffic up the hill to a new development parking area which is still under construction.   What makes it handy is that there is elevator service from the ground floor up to the shopping entrance. I grabbed a cart, picked up some coupons they were giving and tried to make my way around. All around are \"tasting\" stations where you can sample some of their foods. The first one I happened to meet was Pure Sky Farms where I got to sample some arugula. They grow locally and I learned that they are in the process of opening up a location under the Liberty Bridge on East Carson St sometime in the near future.   It has been a long time since I visited Whole Foods in East Liberty but I remembered that they primarily sell organic food as well as premium beauty items. The meat aisle served the freshest I had ever seen including a butcher's area. All the samples I tried were very good but keep in mind you are paying for this quality.  When you go around the perimeter of the store you will encounter dairy, breads, pastries and even a section where they sell local gifts. I recognized my Tee I had purchased last week from Commonwealth Press and was told that they are one of the suppliers but this Tee was made out of some sort of organic material. Note it was the same price as what I paid for mine last week. Honestly no one will know the difference!  Near the produce section is a standalone coffee, tea, and juice bar called \"Good Neighbor.\" I did not stop here since I had seen similar setups in other major grocery chains. While visiting the bread section I learned that some are made in house and the others are supplied by Mediterra bakery in Robinson Twp. Since I'm a fan of Mediterra and have been there previously I ordered a cranberry walnut bread from Whole Foods to freeze and try.  Continuing on from the bread and baked goods area I came across stands that sell charcuterie, pizza, and stacked sandwiches. Across from it are 4 bars, one being a salad bar and the others various foods you can take out. Cost is $8.99 per pound. Near the pub is a complete selection of wine and beers and growlers for purchase  What I was disappointed with was when I tried to maneuver through the aisles they are so narrow and packed to the brim with groceries. I am taking into consideration that this is opening day but I don't see it getting any better once the initial crowds wear off.  Don't look for ethnic foods here. If you want that then head over to the Market District near Village Square.  They have a similar style layout and I'm sure this place will go head to head with them.  Part two. 1788 Pub. Yes they built a tiny eatery and bar within this complex. Since this is their only location I decided to try their food for lunch. It is set up at a right angle to the general lounging and eating area. They serve lunch and dinner M-Sat and on Sun they have a weekend brunch. For lunch you could have anything from half shell oysters, steamed mussels, purple cabbage, pierogies,to catfish, chicken and NY strip. It is counter service but you order at the bar. There you can get signature cocktails and wine by the glass.  Since I had a medical apt following this visit I didn't want to have a bevvie but wanted a store tea. I was told that I would have to purchase that first through the regular checkout area and then I could bring it in to drink when I placed my order.  So I went to pay for the few items I bought and was told I had the wrong cart! It's a standard grocery store cart and since I was using express checkout I was told I needed a mini cart but they gave me a carry one. Joy!  Back to 1788 Pub I went with my purchases and ordered the tempura fried catfish which comes with spicy sauce, kale, and turmeric pickles. After I placed my order I was given a light buzzer which you all use while you're waiting for your food or a table. The lady I was chatting with regarding the spicy sauce was kind enough to bring my meal to me. With the exception of the NY strip steak which is $22.00 expect to pay at least $12.00 for your food not including cocktails. Brunch prices follow suit.  My meal was okay but filing enough. I though the sauce was too spicy for me so they brought me a mayo sauce that worked better. I would say the food was average for me but prepared well. Next time I visit I'll try one of those food stations they have outside. Please note they don't list the price of these stations, I had to ask for it so keep that in mind when you wish to dine here. Depending upon weight you can pay a fortune.  Other than that this is just the third of the Whole Foods chain. Good food, high prices"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this Whole Foods, only because I know how vast and amazing they can be.  The highlight of this store (for its size) is definitely the hot food and salad bar, along with their prepared food. Tons of options, always fresh, and not too expensive.  One thing that really bugs me is that even thought the store is small, it's difficult to find products (usually the ones that have coupons that week), and even when I ask an associate, it takes us a decent amount of time to find it together.  I've heard their breakfast is killer, especially on the weekends, so I'll be making my way back to check that out soon. I also really want to try one of their cooking classes!"}
{"text":"After moving here from Los Angeles, I have to say that I was really expecting more from the Whole Foods in Madison, especially in the produce department.  I have been nothing but disappointed with this Whole Foods, but I guess that's why this one is so much cheaper than any other one I've ever been to.  The store is the same size as the one I used to shop at, however, the layout is so terrible that you can hardly push a cart through.  And when it comes to vegan/vegetarian food, there is literally one tiny little cold case.  That's it.  I have been to WF in Los Angeles, Burbank, Sherman Oaks, Chicago, Fairfax, and even in hillbilly Columbia, SC and every single one has at least three cold aisles of vegetarian and vegan foods.  Then, every time I go in, the selection is smaller and smaller, and when I ask about products that have been carried there for months that suddenly disappear, I get looked at like I'm crazy, as if those products never existed in the first place.  Their basics are awful, the deli and food bars are gross and loaded with unnecessary fillers that are usually contradictory to Whole Foods in general, but I suppose when you're the only one in a very large area, you can get away with most anything.  I find more vegan options at Woodmans, suprisingly enough.  Definitely not impressed."}
{"text":"Awesome. Exclpt it's way too small. We need like 20 more of these statewide. La Crosse first please"}
{"text":"This is my favorite grocery store in town, which is a bold statement considering Willy Street Co-op is another shop I frequent just as much. But I say Whole Foods wins.  I appreciate their bakery for two reasons:  1) the seeduction rolls/bread 2) the oatmeal raisin cookies  The SEEDUCTION ROLL is a must buy in each of my visits to Whole Foods. They are perfectly portioned to be warmed and enjoyed with a smear of avocado or nut butter. The heartiness of the whole grains, the crunch from the pepitas and poppy seeds throughout, this bread is the carbs of my dreams.  The OATMEAL RAISIN COOKIE is a recent discovery and a random choice among the other items in the bakery cases. I don't like raisins, but I very much liked this cookie and want it now. The texture was chewy but so dense and moist and subtly sweet and even more sweet with the addition of some raisins.   Another plus at Whole Foods is their produce selection and prices. While some items will be pricey indeed, not all of them are. Shop with a knowledge of what's a reasonable amount to pay for certain fruits and veggies and only buy the ones that are marked at the right price. Quality, organic produce comes at a steeper rate, but I find it worth it and there are plenty of fruit and veg options at Whole Foods that I find comparable in price to other shops.     Along with the produce section, there is a machine to freshly grind peanut and almond butters (my favorite thing and my weakness). This always earns the grocery store an extra 10 points in my book. It's so lovely when you dig into a fresh container of NUT BUTTER and it's still warm and you can smell the nuttiness oh my.  Dairy prices are decent and I appreciate the grand assortment of dairy-free milk choices because almond and coconut milks are fun :)   The dry goods at Whole Foods are also priced right. For those who enjoy canned BEANS for their protein source like me, WF actually has the best prices in town. Organic chickpeas, black beans, red kidney beans...I stock up on these here.  One thing that's not so great is the meat and fish prices. They're steep.  The hot bar, while it adds up $$$ very quickly when weighed, is pretty great taste wise and for the convenience factor. Dinner is set. The food is delicious and each tray of food is listed with all the ingredients it contains. Besides the price, it's rockin.  Oh and if you're ever looking to make your own Acai Bowl, they have packs of ACAI in the freezer section. Pretty expensive and probably not a necessary item, but it's fun to try. I did :)  Whole Foods basically is there as a reliable place for staple groceries as well as all the random items you've been searching around for at other stores but can't seem to find. I bet you that they'll have it."}
{"text":"Yeah yeah, this place is pricey, but they have a wide selection of cakes and pies! and they're mouthwatering and so gooooooooodddddd! Come here if you wanna have some good cakes!"}
{"text":"If you can get past the questionable labor practices and your knee-jerk anti-corporate philosophy, Whole Foods has a pretty decent selection of organic food.   Deli sucks balls though.  And you can quote me on that."}
{"text":"I tried to give this store the benefit of the doubt, but a year later after going 1-2x/per week, I will be shopping elsewhere. I have shopped at Whole Foods Markets in Boston, Chicago, and Milwaukee for over a decade now, and I never encountered the consistent issues I do at the Madison location. The main issues are the 1) produce, 2) bakery, 3) deli, and 4) customer service.  1) You would think that WF would have amazing produce, but if you shop here, good luck! Unless you come at the golden hour of 1-2 PM before all of the stay-at-home parents ravage the shelves before they pick their kids up from school, good luck finding anything that either passes as fresh, or is ripe enough to use that day. Both my wife and I work, so we rarely get to the store before 5:00 PM. The produce stocker is usually around, chatting and re-organizing well stocked items like avocados that could pass as cannonballs, or explaining \"of course those strawberries are rotten, why do you think they are on sale?\" If you have the audacity to ask him to look in the back for something usable, be prepared to wait 10 minutes. 2) The bakery is OK, but be prepared for the mid-afternoon rush that wipes out the shelves with no hope of a replenishment for us poor souls that have to be at work all day. 3) Deli is usually alright, except for a few people behind the counter that obviously missed \"meat slicing training day\". Ever asked for a pound of premium sliced sandwich meat, and then watched as the slicer literally wads up the thin slices with a technique that can only come from making snowballs? 4) The customer service here is dreadful. Eye-rolls and sarcastic glances are commonplace from the checkout clerks and baggers. Buying 300$ worth of groceries to last you a week? Be prepared to bag your own, because there is one person with one item that necessitates opening the 15-items-or-less lane, followed by casual chatting with the other baggers just watching. Oh, you were lucky enough to get your over-priced, rotten produce bagged? Good luck! Produce lining the bottom of the bags topped with canned goods is actually fairly common, and over-stuffing bags happens too. Just last week we were lucky enough to get our groceries bagged, only to find out the bag on the bottom of the cart was so over-filled it was dropping produce out all over the parking lot. When I approached the customer service counter to see what could be done for the 20$ worth of goods that were ruined from poor service, I got \"well, you better buy more\" as a response. So pleasant!   There are a few bright spots: the dry and canned goods are usually stocked well, and the meat counter is usually stocked as well.    In summary, I want to offer my sincerest apologies to the staff at WF for the incredible inconvenience frequenting their store and purchasing thousands of dollars worth of goods every year causes. But worry not! I won't be back!"}
{"text":"With all the chemicals, pesticides, pollution, GMO's and hormone injected food, Whole Food stood up to provide organic food. However I think I just ate a gasoline brisket at this location.   I like Whole Foods bread, salads and food bar. When I'm home in Chicago, I eat at WF every single day. Big fan. Recently I stopped by this location on my way to Pittsburgh airport. From outside, this location looks neat and brand new. It's spacious from the inside and has plenty of indoors and outside seats.   I was all happy until I tasted the food. I added a piece of brisket, one piece of fried chicken and one chicken drumstick to my salad. Oh man!! When I opened the salad box, a strong petroleum smell slapped my nose. I found out it was coming from the brisket. I think they marinated the brisket in gasoline and charcoal. It was tender, but not edible. So I discarded it. The fried chicken was bone dry so I didn't eat it. The roasted chicken drumstick felt you're biting into big chunks of dry spices rub, ugh!. Left it alone as well. The green vegetables I added were really fresh and nice. But the gasoline taste overwhelmed everything.   To buy groceries, I think this WF is great and standard. For the food section, it would be nice if the manager or the cooks could taste the food before serving it. I was tired and in a hurry to complain about that gasoline charcoal brisket."}
{"text":"I love this Whole Food location. I've been to several WF stores, but this one has a warm and welcoming feel. It's a smaller store than other WF stores you may have been in before (and the parking lot is a stressful battlefield of \"survival of the fittest\", but it's all worth it. Whole Foods is pricey, as we all know, but I actually think it beats my other favorite (i.e. Willy Street Co-op). Their deserts are some of the best in town and their deli is fantastic. The prepared food is tasty and their salad bar is actually tasty (which is sometime a difficult task). When it's in season, don't miss the fresh Salmon. It's the best in town."}
{"text":"Okay, so everything is really expensive, sure. The variety of organic/fair trade food is unlike any other place in Madison. And they have a policy to not sell anything with ingredients that are really bad for you i.e. MSG, ammonium chloride, sorbic acid, etc.   It's also not as hipstered out like willy."}
{"text":"I love whole foods but this location has the basics.  The products and help is the normal 4/5 stars but this is one of the smaller locations I have seen. Their deli still has all the goodies you would expect from whole foods. Still it is better than not having a whole foods at all like most of Wisconsin."}
