{"text":"Best pizza in Calgary bar none. Won the Calgary sun pizza pig out 3 years running and I can see why. Great toppings, always fresh, have been going here for years."}
{"text":"Not great pizza at all.  I do not think the owners are Italian, lol.

Old rundown location, not busy, and will not be back.

If you want quality, go somewhere else (Verns, Panago, Toms)"}
{"text":"Always good pizza. Hard to find a take out place nowadays that isn't a big chain. Tastes great!"}
