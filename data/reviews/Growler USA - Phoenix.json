{"text":"We loved the atmosphere and the modern and warm environment! My husband is a beer lover and I am a healthy eater and sometimes we struggle to find a place that is a bar like environment where my husband can enjoy multiple choices of beers and watch sport and I can still order healthy food. We found the perfect place. I ordered  mahi tacos and they were phenomenal. Service was great and friendly and the patio is dog friendly as well. I love this place and definitely will go back. Great environment for families  as well!!!"}
{"text":"Small, casual, relaxing hang.  Great beer selection; knowledgeable, attentive staff, and a dog friendly patio - a potential winner in the otherwise benign, institutional aesthetic of City North.  Menu is very limited - tater tots, forgettable pulled pork sliders, baked(!) brat - essentially nothing more than something to fill the void in between beers.  Looking forward to an expanded menu.  Great gastro grub would make Growler a star."}
{"text":"Great new location in a much needed area in city north.  Good mix of music playing, great beer, good food, however it's the amazing staff that keeps me coming back.  They have a great attitude, good recommendations of beer and \"if uber friendly is good\" then this would be the place to go.  The best beer tender and no offense to the rest is Meg , who I wanna say was ripped as the girl who starts with an M for not wanting to fill a growler.  I personally have seen her fill dozens with a smile on her face that would light up a dark room.  The prices are great as it's cheaper to hang there then to take Meg on a date.  Keep up the great work staff.  

Ps. The owner is \"uber friendly\" as well."}
{"text":"12p Sunday, one of about 3 tables in the place, and once seated outside we might as well have been on the moon :-) .  Beer = nice, but this day, service  was eh.  I'll be back to drink, but I know what to expect from a newly opened place."}
{"text":"Website stated that they are open til 10. Drove there and arrived at 9:10 to get a growler to go and the bar tender told us that he already did last call 10 mins prior. The bar had 10-12 people with full beers and we just wanted a growler but he wouldn't even serve us that. I understand last call means last call but when you have a bar with people and someone asking for a to go order it shouldn't be hard. Oh and it was my first time going there and definitely my last. Terrible experience. Awful customer service.."}
{"text":"Large selection of constantly changing taps is great.  However, Growlers real strong point is the STAFF! Friendly, helpful with beer selection and always close by to make sure you are happy and have everything you need. Can't say enough about the service"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get a beer. The food is improving with recent additions to the menu. I really like the changing beer menu. I find the bartenders - esp Chelsea-very helpful and knowledgeable about the beer selection. One suggestion:  the beer samples are a tad too small to get a good feel for the beer."}
{"text":"Honestly, very forgettable experience.  Yes, they have a big beer selection, but so do other places nearby, even the chain YardHouse.  Their food menu leaves a lot to be desired, in terms of selection and quality.  

My main grudge was the strange seating arrangement.  There's a long table straddling the inside and outside sections, something to fit 12 people or so.  They are putting multiple parties here, and it was incredibly awkward.  My friend and I (party of 2) were placed directly across from another couple, to the point we were in the conversations of our neighbors.  We then had to move out chairs to face each other and talk kinda quiet so as not to be disruptive to the other groups.  No problems with a sense of community, but when seated, I shouldn't have to introduce myself to others already at my table, who can hear my every word.   

Overall, you'll find better venues around High Street and Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"My husband & I love Growler! We usually sit on the patio with our pup because we love the atmosphere. it's our favorite place to grab a beer and a few appetizers - highly recommend the beer cheese nachos. The servers are always very attentive and knowledgeable about the beers. Keep it up, Growler!"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped by here a couple of weeks ago.  I had noticed the advertised large selection of brews on tap and wanted to check it out.  I pretty much stick to wheat beers and they had a few selections.  They had a large selection IPA's (too many in my opinion), but that's not really a hit on Growler as IPA's are the \"it\" beer lately; so I understand they are catering to what people want just like anywhere else.  

At first I was a bit disappointed at the size of the food menu but overall, maybe it's a good thing to do a few items right than to try to do too much.  I like that the portions are smaller (such as 1 pretzel or 2 sliders).  Too often, I don't even bother ordering food at other places because it's just too much.  I thought the pretzel and cheese was excellent and so were the rib meat sliders."}
{"text":"This place really has potential but right now it is falling short.  The atmosphere is great, the patio is a good place to relax with a beer, and the service is OK.

The downside is that the beer selection isn't as robust as it seems.  The first 3 beers I ordered the bartender informed me that they were sold out.   Also the food is awful.  The wings were tiny and bland, the short rib sliders were tough and tasted like the meat was microwaved, and the nachos were inedible (they were absolutely drowning in cheese sauce to the point it was like a nacho soup).

I really hope this place turns it around because they are in a great location and have a great opportunity to make it a happening spot."}
{"text":"We are craft beer snobs, do not drink crap on tap. With that being said we have frequented many establishments that offer a great selection of craft beer on tap and I have to say the selection was great however 3.00 for a 4oz pour is a bit much. My flight was 18.00 for 24oz of beer. A bit much!! The selection of food wasn't really that great either. I'm not impressed. It's not likely we will go back here even after they are completely up and running unless they become more competitive with their price point. Was hopeful, but disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Scottsdale for 2 years. I had no idea how Fabulous Growlers USA would be, Growlers has become not only my new \"go to\" favorite, but this \"must see\" gathering spot is where I will and would recommend before any others to visiting family, friends, clients and neighbors. Ale, food,staff, and friendliness are second to none!"}
{"text":"I wanted to edit my previous review after reading the comment from the owner and decided to come back and give it a second shot. 

As I previously stated in a prior review the buffalo chicken dip was amazing. The mac and cheese has been fixed and is actually pretty good, filling! 
The pretzel with beer cheese is also a pretty great snack. 

Good beer choices, Tv's, seems like a completely different environment since the first time I went. I plan on returning"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer and eat. Pretzels are great. Great place for a quiet Sunday afternoon.
Would come back again on the weekend."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome selection of beers. I especially like the fact that many are local. If you can't find what your looking for in a beer here you don't like beer. 

I have eaten here a couple of times and have never been disappointed with the quality of the eats. 

The staff is all very knowledgeable and Sandy will take great care of you. She is fun to talk to and knows her beers. I would recommend Growlers USA on High to anyone."}
{"text":"Going 5 star all the way, the staff here is outstanding, they really hustle to get to all of the customers in a very timely manner and pick up and clean up immediately, I mean they really do an excellent job.  Sandy is incredible, she's working hard and always has a smile, always uber attentive.  Met the owner - George, and I felt that he really cared and was a very genuine character, he was leading by example and bussing tables, checking on customers, bringing out orders, and introducing himself and shaking hands.  Not too often that you see this from an owner, at least in my experience.  Can't say enough about the staff and the super clean environment.  I consider myself a bit of a beer snob and aficionado, I do brew my own beer, the selection of beers I found very pleasing, and I did order food as well and it was great.  Environment on High street is wonderful, I'd encourage anyone to stop in, meet the amazing staff, enjoy a fabulous beer selection, and relax.  Really a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Really cute, modern place that serves beer my husband likes and wine that I enjoy. We ordered the buffalo chicken dip and it was GOOD! Not too heavy on the buffalo sauce, but was still rich and delicious. Pita bread was also really good. Justine has been our server/ bartender and she remembers us when we come in & is sweet and friendly. One thing I would suggest: for nachos, maybe have fresh guac prepared? I wanted the nachos but \"need\" guac with my nachos. I am high maintenance like that. Lol ;) otherwise, really great place in high street to try. Casual, chill place"}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be good, I really did. But I'm sad to report that I was very underwhelmed. The concept is great, tons of beer options on tap and they are very adorable. And our server was super sweet. That is the only reason I didn't rate this place lower. But we ordered the buffalo chicken dip and it came out cold. Not room temperature or cool. Literally cold like it came straight out of the refrigerator. When we told our server she was mortified and sure apologetic. She brought it back and it was nice and got the second time. But still just unacceptable. I'm new to the area in north Phoenix/Scottsdale and we could really use a neat place to grab a beer. This one just didn't do it for me unfortunately."}
{"text":"Just opened.   Cool place.  Great beer.    Simple and well done food too 
Outside blows super cold so this will be a sweet place to hang during the summer too."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers, including local beers, good food, and service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Great beer and snacks! We love local and this was the perfect date night for us. Highly recommend especially if you live in the area and can walk there."}
{"text":"I love this place....usually.  New waitress is a bummer though.  Really needs to work on her attitude and customer service.
Would have been a 5-star rating otherwise"}
{"text":"Giving this a 3 rating mostly because of the service.  The bartenders were not very friendly or attentive.  I had to flag them both down to get an order, and even then they were not too enthusiastic.  I am used to friendly bartenders at places like this.  The food we ordered was good but the menu is limited.  The place was not very crowded, so no excuse to not have good service."}
{"text":"This place is great if you like a wide variety of beer. Always friendly staff and a really nice patio that is dog friendly. It is usually pretty empty in this place so I do worry about how long they will last, and the hours are hit or miss as they tend to close early if it is empty. I watched them turn away 8+ people at 9pm when they close at 10pm and I don't run a bar, but that can't be good for business. They only served us one beer when we got there at 9pm and we would have been happy to spend more money but it was \"last call\" for 10pm. 

Food is alright and the pretzels, wings, and tots are the best. Like I said before, if you like beer this place is for you... if not there are definitely better options around. We will see how long they last on High Street."}
{"text":"This place is great. Indoor and outdoor seating with great misting systems. Huge variety on tap and the food is great. The beer cheese sauce is phenomenal! They have a dog friendly patio too! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Friday night after happy hour at a nearby restaurant. Growler was by far the busiest spot in the High Street area. I had a handful of tasters (I'm a flight person when it's an option) and my friend had a couple pints. Extensive beer selection, upbeat yet chill atmosphere, lots of TVs and great service (thanks Meg!) Can't wait to come back when I have more time to stay and enjoy. I'll also be trying the food next time, it looked tasty!"}
{"text":"They keep it FRESH here...each time I've been in there has been a new selection of 80 plus drafts.  Awesome selection of different categories (IPA, Blondes, pilsners, wheat, Amber's, reds, etc etc etc).

I expected the food to take a back seat to the beer but that isn't the case.  The food was is as good as the beer.  Recommend the wings and tacos. 

BONUS...patio is Dog Friendly woof woof!"}
{"text":"Growlers is amazing! Buffalo chicken dip is my favorite item on the menu! Great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"First time here and had a great time. Ambiance was very welcoming. Service was friendly and quick. Everyone was knowledgeable about the food and the beer. I will definitely be back for more Brews and food... especially the Brews. Super dog friendly as well."}
{"text":"Awesome little place on the corner with great outdoor seating and bar area. The short rib tacos very tasty with a nice kick. Literally 100 beers on tap and you can taste before choosing. Pizza port chronic amber and Hiss Vienna lager highly recommended. The waiters are knowledgeable too. You will not be disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Nate was awesome and let us try a lot of beers before deciding on the perfect one. Buffalo chicken dip was good but needed more spice and might have been better with tortilla chips. Lots of beer choices to satisfy even the most picky person"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and attentive. The food was not so great though. The mac n cheese leaves something to be desired, especially when adding the beef short rib. Not at all worth what they charged for that. They're in training mode, so they say. Hope foods gets better after this training mode. Will give them one more shot."}
{"text":"Ok, first, this is a classic beer bar concept in a basically a 'community', so unfortunately the reviews may reflect that.  

Ignore them.  

If you enjoy trying a wide selection of beers, mostly Arizona, then Growler USA should be on your short list.  With 100+ taps, you can get something that appeals to just about anyone, or flights so you can compare styles.  I was able to put together a tasting of 5 big IPA's, all from Arizona, some new, but all that I don't normally get outside of AZ.  

To absorb the alcohol, I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos with tater tots, which arrived fast and hot from the kitchen.  Yes, it's a small menu of bar items, but the emphasis here is on the beer, as it should be.

If you like craft beer, and you're in the Desert Ridge area, come here.

P.S.  it's called Growler because you can take beer home!  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Had GREAT service from our server Ryan. Mikey was the best manager and I had a great experience. 5 stars for Growlers. And who doesn't love 100 beers on tap!?"}
{"text":"We went for food and beer tonight and everything was amazing. The servers were knowledgable with what beer was available and the service was extremely fast! 

All beer was good, none of us really tried anything new, but server was very good at explaining and letting us know how she personally felt about the beers (which was helpful)! 

We got the Asian salad, which was amazing. Pretzel with beer cheese, buffalo chicken dip and macaroni. All were very good and decent sharing portions. The men of the group ordered the wings and they are super picky about their wings. But they ended up ordering a second order, they were so good! No complaints on the food! 

We often eat out with our child, at appropriate times of course, so the only recommendation that we would give would be to offer some kid friendly drinks and cups. 

All in all we were extremely pleased with service and will 100% be back!"}
{"text":"Interesting little spot on the ever changing High Street. This place doesn't look like it could have 100 beers or so, but it does. My only beer sample was a Koffee (yes it was spelled that way) variety, which was good if you like coffee and darker beers. As for the food:
Buffalo Chicken Dip - If we just ordered this the rating would be higher. Tender chicken floating in a level 2 buffalo sauce with cheese and served with warm pita bread. This was a clear winner and we couldn't get enough.
Short Rib tacos - not so good. The meat was dry and stringy and the taco only contained dry white cabbage. Everything needs to change on this dish.
Brisket Sandwich - supposedly smoked at owner's house (and driven over?) was good enough, but won't challenge any real BBQ joint.

Appetizers and beer might be the best route at this place going forward."}
{"text":"Awesome place for great beer! I got the jubilation winter which is very Christmassy--VERY GOOD. Also got an awesome cider. They have hundreds of beers! Great service and ambiance. They also have phone chargers which is so cool!"}
{"text":"Menu is limited (mostly bar snack type items) but their beer selection is phenomenal.  I had some of the most interesting beers I've ever tasted.  I didn't necessarily love all of them but this is a fantastic spot to grab a flight and do some day drinking."}
{"text":"If you are gluten free, you should probably go somewhere else. The drink options are limited (I had alcohol free kombucha which was delicious) and so is the menu (I ordered chips and salsa). Went for happy hour and everyone else in the group seemed to love it though. All I wanted was a mixed drink, but they don't serve any type of hard liquor. Their outdoor patio is awesome, I definitely recommend sitting out there!"}
{"text":"All the food was really good, but had to order the Mac & cheese after reading all the reviews and they were spot on - it was delicious! (And I'm not much of a cheese fan to begin with so that says something) They have a great selection of beer but unfortunately ordering a flight means paying $2-3 per pour instead of one simple price. I'd like to try more kinds but the pricing deters me. The waitress was new and ended up overcharging my card, I didn't realize until the next day but I spoke with the owner who handled it same day! I'd love to come back and try out more beer and food, but would recommend a better flight pricing"}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointing. Here on a Friday at HH. Server MIA. Host MIA. Ubered here and decided to give it a shot. Epic fail. It's 4:30pm and the women's bathroom has trash on the floor in the stalls. And if you're 5'7\" the bathroom mirrors will probably work for you too. Server still MIA. Just found out...ZERO mgr on duty. Must speak to an owner? This place blows."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Servers are hit or miss. We have a few favorites that we love! Also great tots"}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Do not eat the food. Ordered nachos and they came out cold. Service is decent. I tried it once and probably won't come back. Not necessarily a bad experience, just not one I'm excited to repeat."}
{"text":"Their beer selection is superb and their bartenders are absolutely amazing (the Saturday night crew on 10/1..you rock)! They allow tastes of the beers that have growler fills but not those that do not have growler fills on the menu. 

I'd recommend getting a flight because the second you order one beer you see five more you want to try. Personally I mixed That strawberry blonde with a topper of the smores stout and it was like a nutella strawberry sandwich. My mouth is watering right now. I also had a tower station IPA while we watched the ASU vs USC game. 

Their menu was great for bar bites, but I was bummed that they did not have any veggie items on the menu. I expected a little more from the menu in terms of food, but rightly so as they focus their time and resources on fantastic rotating taps."}
{"text":"A must for any beer lover! They have a great beer selection and the food is a perfect pairing to have with your beer of choice. I've been there several times and have had great service every time. The only short comings are that the menu is limited and the beer menu can't keep up with the tap rotations. I'm still giving 5 stars because the food is good and gives you enough to fill you up while having a beer. The servers are up on what's on tap so that's not a big deal either."}
{"text":"Great experience with a wide selection of beer and an upgraded food menu. Loved the session IPAs (Founders All Day and Hess ) which worked well for a Monday.  Relaxed environment with plenty of TVs to watch sports and a friendly staff. Mahi Mahi tacos were great, but the beef short rib sliders were phenomenal! 10 out of 10 would recommend, will definitely be coming back to Growler USA."}
{"text":"Wow!! Some of our favorites on tap! Cali Cream Ale on Nitro? Waaaahhhttt??? Amazing! Great bar tender topped it off! I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming in, getting a flight of new fresh local brews and eating some short rib Mac n cheese. Food is great, staff is friendly and always something new to taste!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing variety of beer. $2 off beers for happy hour. The loaded sidewinders were a really good appetizer with super unique flavor. Patio is dog friendly as well which is a perk!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch spot! Had the mac and cheese with beer brat and tots and it was ON POINT! 100 beers on tap, only had a few but lots of rare ones for sure! Bartendress Sandy was a delight!"}
{"text":"Beer selection was good, although I was dissapointed with the number of beers I'd already had other places (I was looking for more unusual local beers).  The food is pretty decent, though I wouldn't go there soley for the food, the beer selection is good enough to make me want to go back."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, good atmosphere, food was okay and service was lacking.  It seems they are trying but need to get their ducks in a row!"}
{"text":"Not a bad little place! Was pretty slow for a Friday night (but all of High Street was slow) but decided to go since it was close to house and they have my favorite Boulevard Tank 7 on draft which I highly recommend. I'd give it a 5 Star probably but we didn't see much of our waiter and even had to go up to bar to pay when we were ready to leave. I'd still recommend and we will go again because of the beers they have available"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time tonight and I will totally go back.  Our server was very informative and helpful.  I ordered a flight of 6 beers and liked every single one.  We also got a few appetizers and they were all pretty good.  They only thing I could suggest is that they need to make it a little less bright in the restaurant.  The bar was so bright it was like being interrogated.  Lol. But overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Lots of beer you can get anywhere. Food is below average. Ambiance is below average. Don't see this place lasting long."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with family and friends. The service is always outstanding. Nicole was the server for my party last time and she was amazing. The food selection is mainly standard bar food, but it is good! When I got, my party and I generally get 3-4 appetizers and split them between us as opposed to get us all getting an entree. I also love how they have the option for 3oz of beer when you don't want a full glass of a beer, and have the option for the flight of beers!

It is a very casual vibe, but the service is excellent. I've found it is often difficult to find a place that is casual yet has good service. A great place to grab beers and food with a group!!!"}
{"text":"Okay beer selection, Yard House is just down the street and has a lot to choose from.  Ordered the pretzel and didn't eat more than a bite.  Not good at all and the waitress didn't seem to care or ask if something was wrong."}
{"text":"Great beers. Fun bartender. Cool place to go. Food is amazing and my friend said, \"you had me at short rib queso\""}
{"text":"This place has a great low-key feel. Massive selection of beers, obviously. Great munchie food, get the beer cheese and pretzels, very tasty. They have amazing revolving lists of craft beers, go you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  My family and I stumbled on Growler USA and absolutely loved the great selection of beers.  The food was was also very tasty and we loved that we were able to order and share various items.  Equally important is the staff where all very friendly and even the owner came to our table to ask if we were enjoying ourselves.  We will for sure go back!"}
{"text":"They are still in trainng mode having just opened a few days ago. Nice set up, kind of like an upscale sports bar with a fantastic craft beer list. We sat outside on one of two patios. Service was friendly, but spotty. It took awhile just to get our beers and when they did come, there was way too much head on the pour. One of our party tried a flight. Again, some were full, others half full. All night we had uneven pours. This is compounded by getting a \"glass\" of beer, not a pint. They should list the ounces, like they do for the 5 oz pours. We asked for water and were brought warm water to start, with no ice. ugh. Later they brought a bottle that was cold however. Not sure why the warm stuff first. We tried both versions of the sliders, and both were excellent. You get 2 decent sized sliders with ample ingredients. The side of tots we ordered were very pedestrian however, and were only saved by the dips. We were there for happy hour which goes until 6:30. 20% off beers, and 30% off all appetizers, except the wings. Cmon, include the wings.  Why use percentages? I like this place, but it is a chain operation and it seems they have some practices that reflect that.e.g. % off rather than a clear dollar amount. \"glasses\" of beer rather than a pint,     (our waiter said they were 16 oz pours, but I am sceptical) and please bring the beers out with no more than a half inch of head! Lastly, I love IPAs, so really appreciated the huge selection, but one of our party loves a good Scottish ale, and the one and only was Kiltlifter, which you can try anywhere in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went to this place after seeing it on Yelp.  I was thinking it was going to be more non casual based on the pictures I saw but it was super chill.  My mission tonight was a crown and coke but ended up going with a beer.  They had a lot to choose from and I settled on a chocolate coffee beer which I found to be gross which is why I knocked off a star.  This was reccomended to me... I also tried a Kona lager.  It was good but nothing like my mexican beer of choice Tecate.  If your looking for a chill place and are down with different beers this is the place for you"}
{"text":"I came here with some family for a couple of beers on a Saturday night and it was a lot of fun. The place was not very busy and we were able to snag a nice booth outside on the patio.
Their beer selection was AMAZING and I really appreciated how they had the beer menu categorized into brew styles. The prices on the beers seemed a little steep, but I think the selection made up for it. 
Wife and I split a pretzel which was delicious - nice large size and it came out hot and fresh (I definitely recommend it). The only thing missing was a nice mustard for the pretzel - most places have a special \"beer mustard\" or something similar, but they were able to bring out some Dijon which sufficed.
The server and other employees were very friendly and I think our server came to our table to make sure we had everything about 5 times which is great. 
One thing that held me back from 5 stars was the overall character of the place. It was a nice open, clean environment, but it was missing some touches to make it really stand out. Also, there was some LED lighting on the patio that really took away any ambiance that may have been there. 
Overall I really liked coming here and would like to come back to try some more beers and more of their menu items."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, my favorite beer on tap Papago Orange Blossom!! The mac and cheese with the beef was amazing! Super soft pretzel with tasty cheese. Service was awesome, definitely hope they expand the food menu!!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, a ton of taps. Prices are decent. They have a 2 page stapled paper menu which is a little tacky. 
Bartender is very unfriendly. She did not smile one time or say thank you. After delivering us our drinks she promptly walked away and got on her cell phone right in front of us. She delivered us our check without any eye contact. Super subpar customer service but at least there's beer to keep you company. 
Terrible first impression. With so many places to get craft beer I'll spend my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! Great beer selection, my friend had the nachos and he said they are delicious. Dog friendly patio which is always a plus. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I usually end my reviews with our tab $$. At this point we have been waiting so long that it will not be possible.

Pretzel and beer cheese - great

Beer Ruben - good, hubby could not finish. Served on a white plate with two handfuls of semi warm tater tots 

Brat sliders - one brat cut in half, served luke warm with onion and pepper on two slider buns, (on a white plate large enough to hold 10 sliders), without a garnish to make it at least look like it was worth $9.

Craft root beer - good

Coke - from a can, no refills, $2. I suggest management keep an eye on grocery store ads. I bought Coke at Bashas this week for $2.22 a twelve pack. 

Service - truly lacking. One waitress, one host, and a couple of bartenders. 

Final straw for me was the wait for the check. After an eternity the waitress showed up. Wanted to know why I was still sitting at the table (that's a new one on me.) I replied that I was waiting for the check. Her response \"why didn't anyone bring it?\" Hmmm, I was wondering the same thing."}
{"text":"Quite Good. The best Tater Tots......!!!! Had a yearn and boy, did they deliver,  The Brat Sliders (2) were super, the Ruben,  named different,  but  excellent! A different  variety  of French fries....like curly but fat.  Yummy! Service by Sandy was superb, the fellow  who took over at shift change  was, well, more interested in talking to staff than serving customers. 
Oh well....
 Great beer selection.  If back in the area and Sandy is ON duty, we shall stop again."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment after an interview to blow off some steam. Hey don't judge interviews are really stressful! Anyways the place is small and very minimalistic. So don't think you're coming into some bougie Gastro pub that's not what it is and that's not what they're trying to be. OK now that you've accepted that we can move onto the finer aspects my experience. 

The bartender was very friendly and offered me a couple different options before I decided on my IPA and I like that because at most other places they make you feel weird about asking for samples. I chose a blood orange IPA hoping that it wasn't too girly looking and thankfully it wasn't. It was really good right until the last half whenever I decided I was going to knock it over on myself! Horribly embarrassed and soaking wet I had to ask the bartender for a couple towels to try to clean up the mess. She grabbed her towels and wiped off my phone to save it which was freaking awesome of her. While I tended to the floor and myself- spirit broken but still alive! She kindly offered me another half pour so I could finish the beer with some dignity. Before I left she wanted me to try two more different IPAs so when I came back I could try something new. Both are very good recommendations on her part and once the image of me sitting soaking wet at the bar fades from everyone's memory I will definitely return with my pancho!"}
{"text":"Visited the establishment for the first time over the weekend.  There is like 2 walls worth of beers on tap.  There were too many beer choices to make so I tried the sweet tangerine IPA which was great!  I look forward to coming back again to try more beer flavors and take home a growler or 2 along the way!

The food and service met my expectations except for the fact that the establishment charges extra for soda refills (just a heads up)."}
{"text":"I would not call this place a Gastro Pub, this implies there is a well trained chef in the kitchen.  From our experience tonight this is not the case.  Food is mediocre, the beer is also mediocre.  Service is good, but they don't know how to pour an ice tea (ice is required).  I would say don't waste your time if you have discriminating taste."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer with the ability to do flights of your choosing.  I was able to do a flight of 5 different Stone's and a KBS. 

The staff is friendly.  Food is average bar type stuff."}
{"text":"Ok, so I love some craft brews... and this is the spot if you would like around 100 to choose from. We have visited a few times now. I wanted to get a real feel for service and it was outstanding both times. We sat at the bar. Always got great recommendations and enjoyed the beers we drank.
Now let's talk food. OMG Mac n Beer Cheese . It was outstanding and I'm a Mac n cheese regular. I will Def be back for that again. We always tried the buffalo chicken dip as an app... also very good, but could of used some extra pitas is my only critique. 
Ohh and while we are on the topic of BEER. They had the limited release Founders CBS which I'm happen to say I helped empty that keg. It's was a very hard to find brew. So sad... til we meet again you magnificent stout you."}
{"text":"Went to try it out on May 21 Sunday late afternoon. Me and my husband went to there to relax and have a few drinks . Sat on the patio totally relaxing on great patio furniture misters going felt awesome , ordered some drinks and some apps . Everything was awesome price great but the best part was the service our waitress was awesome A+   Great job. Will be back"}
{"text":"Amazing!
Came here for the beer and fell in love. HUGE beer selection and literally the best pub food I've ever had. Knowledgeable and friendly staff and I love that it is dog friendly. Buffalo chicken dip is the best thing I think I've ever eaten! 
Definitely making this a regular stop!"}
{"text":"Growler USA has vastly improved it's food selection and is warranted a 5 star review now. The beer selection is still second to none and the option to fill growlers is a definite plus. This place is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to go, the staff is very friendly, especially Mikey who is extremely knowledgeable and always give top notch recommendations based on my tastes. Highly recommended for the craft beer afficionado."}
{"text":"Best beer selection! Every week that I come there's a new  couple beers  I still don't have food complaints love the quesadilla and wings"}
{"text":"Ahhhh I hate giving bad reviews but this was not a good experience. I would have given 1 star but the service was pretty good. The major issues however included: they were out of the Pinot Grigio and kambucha, the food was disgusting- cold mac and cheese, undercooked tater tots, the cheese on the mac and cheese was gritty, and the soft pretzel had the wrong kind of salt- they used regular table salt!!! 
I'm hoping these are just opening pains. 
Good luck"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of beer, this is the place to go! The menu is kinda small, but the two appetizer we tried were on point - particularly the buffalo chicken dip! Try it, and a few beers, and you'll leave happier."}
{"text":"What a joke this place is. Love the idea of so many guest taps from all over? I did too! Website says open until 10pm. Walk in at 9:11pm...didn't expect to stay long...you specialize in growlers. This place has a bar, and tables, and a patio. All of which were filled with people. 12 people to be exact. Sit down at said bar. Immediately are told last call was just done 10 minutes prior. Look, I get it, slow night? Close up shop early. Hitting 2am and drunks need to be evacuated? I get it, call last call and close up shop early. But when two well dressed, non-drunk patrons come in 49 minutes before your posted closing time looking for growlers to go, sell them some growlers to go. The point of last call is to ensure everyone is out by a certain time. We would have been out with our growlers long before the other 12 people (which by the way isn't a slow night if you saw the size of this place) finished their drinks. I get it, you don't wanna pour me a pint? Fine. But sell me beer to go...because...that's kind of the name of the business. Literally, Growler USA=Beer to go. You clearly don't want customers."}
{"text":"I've never seen such a large variety of beer! I'm not a huge fan of beer, but trying a flight was a fun experience. If you're a beer connoisseur definitely the place for you! I also had the macaroni and cheese, but I wasn't a fan. The short rib tacos were AMAZING! The lime, cilantro, cabbage garnish was so good. The customer service was also excellent."}
{"text":"This place sucks balls, be smart and stay away.  

Got there and grabbed a table waiting for my wife.  Waited almost 15 minutes for anyone to notice I didn't have any food, let alone a beer.  The waiter who seated me waited on other tables who arrived after me and promptly took their orders.

Be smart and go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Meg & Simone are the epitome of excellent customer service! This place has a great selection of unique and local beers and is located in one of the most beautiful spots in Phoenix. I recommend the Huss Koffee Kölsch!"}
{"text":"Great selection and knowledgeable staff. The food is pretty good too but the beer is why you should come here.
The selection from across America is amazing and the staff is friendly. A great place to relax with friends and drink a beer."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this gem looking for a new spot. The wife likes her beer! The sommelier was in his game. (Yes, the wait staff is actually certified in beer) He selected 6 beers from the list of 100 microbrews. It's not often you get a flight of anything where every selection is amazing! I'm on a \"no fried\" kick these days. I was excited they serve baked chicken wings. We had the sticky BBQ sauce. It was a molasses based sauce with a hint of Asian influence. The evening was perfect for a patio  experience."}
{"text":"The beer menu was tremendous.  Too bad we didn't get acknowledged.  Sat  there and watched others walk in after us and get water and a waitress. When something was mentioned to the hostess, no manager no nothing.  We walked out and went down the street to the COwboy Saloon where we greeted and provided good customer service."}
{"text":"We happened to stop in the other night and catch the game.Our ' Beer-tend-ress' was Nikki & she was great.Helped w tasters and beer selection for the night.The Buffalo wing dip is awesome.We had wings too, they were just as good as last time.The only con for this visit was the Mac N cheese.After looking at picks from past Yelpers, I was so enticed to get the Mac N cheese , I did,but when it arrived, it was really over done.Not the creamy yellow goodness of melted cheese, but brown &very dry, to the point we had to keep dipping in the wing sauces.  Hubby ate the majority though as he isn't a Mac'snob' such as I.
We'll still go back, wasn't bad enough to stay away."}
{"text":"Tried their wings with buffalo sauce. I also was given honey Sriracha and Asian sauce - the honey one takes the win. Next time I'll have this sauce tossed with the wings.

They don't have lemonade so they couldn't fulfill to make a Arnold Palmer but the tea by itself was still good. 

I don't see hard alcohol behind the bar. 

The atmosphere was mellow and the bartenders were happy but not energetic. 

Happy to see that the bar was super clean. 

My table all rated their plates being very good. Brisket sandwich, buffalo wrap, and another set of wings. 

Good selection of beers on tap. No Scottsdale blonde but they did have a Tucson blonde that was a bit lighter. 

The bar gets cold. They have the AC crankin."}
{"text":"Kinda on the fence w this place since it was a wkday ngt arnd 630p n it was dead inside while the other places on High St had much more life .. Only stayed abt 30 mins; the server was nice, didn't order any food but tried a flight n 2 drafts. Idk if we pickd the wrong beers or what (I dnt consider us as novices either we love crafts n IPA's) but out of everythg we just weren't that impressed. Idc abt the TV's bc this isn't a sports bar but once the kinks get workd out w the food, we may return n update the review. Hopefully the owners will add Lagunitas to the handles bc either I missed it or they don't have it."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a group of 15.  Had the chicken wings.  Very good.  A few of my friends had sliders and the mac & cheese and their food was great also.

Our server, Sandy was fantastic.  She got all the orders correct and was very cordial.

Good place for a beer and food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! We love our micro brews. Wanted to try a new place and really enjoyed growlers. Conner was our waiter and had great insight and suggestions for beer choices. I have my favorites but it was nice to have him suggest others I would like. 
We had the beer cheese and pretzel app... yum!
Then the buffalo chicken wrap. It was delicious. The chicken was grilled not breaded and fried so it was not to heavy and had a great kick. 
This is a great place for a drink on the patio and a tasty app!"}
{"text":"I like beer.
I like a wide selection of specialty and micro brews on tap.
I like Growler USA.

Growler is kind of like a wine tasting room, but with a modern ambiance, and a few tv monitors playing random games. 

It's all about the beer.
The beer menu is massive. You'll be seated with paper menu, and there's also big menu on the monitor over the bar. Trying to pick from the expansive menu can be a bit overwhelming. There's at least 100 beers to choose from. But won't worry. Growler has 3oz glasses if you just want to test something out. And even better, there is the option to make your own beer flight (4-6 beers). What more do you need?

There isn't a very big food selection.
The food menu probably had about a dozen items, mostly apps. There are a few salads and entrees. The apps are where it's at. We tried the artichoke dip and the pretzel. Both were great. We also had an order of the blackened chicken tacos with tater tots. Nothing special.

Just a heads up for parents.
This place is NOT designed with kids in mind. We noticed a couple of families with young kids. There were no high chairs or booster seats. The kids were all seated in someone's lap. There is also no kids menu. While they are certainly welcomed in the establishment, I would suggest leaving the little ones at home."}
{"text":"Love the sour beers here.  Come and ask for Michelle she's great to us every Sunday! I've literally been perplexed as to where to go from here in vision to high street... Upon a moment I thought I knew I wanted to come and see Michelle at growler USA.  Even if you're a wine connoisseur. Try a raspberry beermyself... To come and get a nice raspberry beer up on Michelle's recommendation you can never go wrong. I love you all to say enjoy High St., Arizona as much as I have"}
{"text":"Ok First it's great to have a beer place like this down the road.   The beer no complaints at all they have a huge choice.   The two stars is the food was awful and I know they have a small menu so it should be easy.   I was there with four people and the only thing good was the pretzel.  The chicken wings under cooked and cold,  Buffalo chicken sandwich was not very good at all with cold tater tots.   I hope they can fix the issue because it won't make it if they don't get a handle on simple food items.    I like sitting at the bar but we have other options on that street.  So make sure you get the food items on track.   Also, they had no ice in anybody's water glass.  The waiter said the ice machine doesn't produce ice fast enough.  That's a pretty silly."}
{"text":"Went to Growler USA with a party of four and had a great time. The hostess and servers were very friendly and attentive. We got a couch on the patio with our own personal fireplace that looked inside where all the TVs are located so we could watch the final four; pretty awesome setup.

The beer menu was awesome, but having just moved from Michigan and Oberon Day having just happened I would have liked a Bells Oberon which they didn't have. Not a big deal but it would have been a nice bonus. Plus there were a TON of other beers to choose from.

The food menu is just okay, but he appetizers we got were really good. We got the buffalo chicken dip (10/10) and the pretzel with beer cheese dip (9/10). I would like to go back to see what food items get added and get an entree of some sort.

The overall layout and atmosphere of Grolwer USA is really cool and I will most likely go back when I'm in the High Street area!"}
{"text":"They close the kitchen here before the comedy club lets out........could have had a lot more patrons if they actually served the after comedy crowd.... but the place was practically empty. Don't expect this bar to stay open  it was dead on a Saturday night during high tourist season."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a few GREAT beers! Food is ok but that's not what I'm coming for...it's called Growlers people. All the bartenders are very knowledgeable about what they have on tap and recommending something new based off what you like. Highly recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"Great selection. Happy hour is Mon-Thurs. With Mellow Mushroom across the street with fantastic beers and better happy hour deals, which includes Friday, you'll find me skipping this place on the weekdays."}
{"text":"Cute place on high street. The atmosphere is upbeat and casual, no frills just a great beer selection! The staff always remembers us and generally gives good advice on what new beers to try! I wish the food was better, it's like a 2. Overall, cute place, great staff, and an awesome beer selection."}
{"text":"Love the beer selection! Super modern pub! Buffalo chicken dip was delicious and the pub pretzel was alright. It was a nice date place for my husband and I. Probably a good place to start the night off."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection -- local and national craft brews. Food menu is limited and more like appetizers. A few sandwiches though and lunch specials. Don't recommend for dinner. Great open air and lots of plugs at the bar"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Yes they have a limited menu but a nice selection of beer. The food we did get was delicious. Buffalo chicken dip was excellent. Good service and atmosphere. Good prices at the otherwise pricey High Street."}
{"text":"Don't come here for a fine feast or dinner! This is all about the awesome number of beer options and selections and for the opportunity to socialize with great options. Awesome draft options and an amazing patio that is pet friendly!"}
{"text":"Serious beer lovers will definitely enjoy Growler.. The name says it all.  You can get a glass of wine, but with 100 beers on tap, try something new. They water flush the glasses to take the temp to the same as the beer to reduce foaming.  Great selection of local beers.  And the food isn't bad.  But you don't come here for the food.  It is all about the beer."}
{"text":"Awesome staff.  Great beer and food is very reasonable.  I really like the place!  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The beer selection is off the chain. New stuff comes in constantly. Lead by Mikey the expert staff brings it. Good bar food, but the beer is the draw. Dog friendly. This place has a .394 batting average"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere,  wonderful food and most of all an incredible array of beer. Had the tots and an ahi salad, paired with 2 different beers that were nom nom nom"}
{"text":"Just gave it a 2nd try. Staff is good, beer list is great (small glasses...how many ounces?), and food is a horrible failure.  First off, menu is a miss altogether.  Wings are not good, salads are okay, and the mahi tacos were made with rancid fish.  Menu and quality needs a major overhaul if this place is going to have any staying power. 3 stars might be generous. Will go back for a beer, but can't see ordering off the food menu again. What a shame!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been in there they seem unorganized. They don't know if beers are out and usually there are multiple that are not available. The food is marginal at best, and the service is beyond lacking. Not sure where they got their servers from but they would appear to be first time servers and not very good at their job. 

If you want to see an impressive list of quality beers, just go across the street to Mellow Mushroom. The service is more reliable as an added bonus. 

I was so excited when I saw a beer spot was opening up on High Street, but unfortunately they just can't seem to get their act together. 

Needs: 

New management 
New servers/ bartenders 
More inventory 
New menu"}
{"text":"The beer selection here was awesome Unfortunately, we were seated and then sat for over 30 minutes with no one coming to take our order. All attempts at getting a staff member's attention failed. We weren't able to order a beer and finally ended up leaving. Granted, they were busy, but 30 minutes is a little ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great experience and great beer! My husband and I had a very enjoyable time on the patio at night! We learned that the patio is pet friendly so we will be back with our pup!"}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday night with some friends and the place was dead. Our waitress was nice, but wasn't any help picking out food. We ordered a few rounds a beer, two appetizers, and a meal each.

The loaded tots are super good. Wings are good, but way too small for the price. Most of us ordered different varieties of the buffalo wrap - it was good, but nothing to write home about. You'd expect the food to be better with such a small menu.

If you're looking for a place with a large selection of beers and don't want to go to Yard House, this is your spot. I just wish they had better food to complement, especially considering their menu is so small."}
{"text":"Really? One waitress for the whole restaurant on a Sunday afternoon? 30 minutes just to take our order. We had to ask for water several times and finally went up to the bar to be served.
It is a shame because the location is good and the physical layout is very nice.
The food was mediocre and certainly not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Finally made it up to Growler USA. Was impressed with their beer selection and knowledgeable staff. Will definitely be back to try some more beers but for happy hour kitty corner to their spot Mellow Mushroom still crushes them on price and beers. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Have been waiting for this place to open for a while, so finally got to test it out. I don't usually write reviews but with this place being so new I figured I would provide some feedback. 

The place was smaller than I thought but atmosphere was great. Definitely was a nice vibe and service was excellent. We were seated immediately and were greeted by our server right away which was nice. The beer menu is insane, in a good way. Once we decided what we wanted it came really fast. 

The food is where I had the most issues tonight. We started by having the Sticky BBQ wings which were awesome, they were served with carrot sticks, celery, our choice of blue cheese or ranch. The wings are baked which makes them even more delicious, and healthier. 

For own main course we ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos and the mac and cheese with short rib, both with a side of tater tots. The tacos were pretty good overall with a nice piece of fish in each. The mac and cheese was really dry and the short rib was even drier. My guess is that the short rib is baked with the mac which dried it out. I'm not a chef but they should look to do something with that recipe. The tater tots were really bad. They weren't cooked all the way and were just plain cold. The table next to us had the same problem. They complained and got a fresh batch. I didn't really want them anyways so for sake of saving food didn't ask for new ones. 

My last piece of feedback is around TVs. There are two on the walls for the games and then like 6 or so behind the bar. Problem is that only two show the games and the other four or so have the beer menu. I don't think this place is trying to be a sports bar but with the lack of options around them if they converted all those TVs to sports, at least on Saturday and Sunday, they could fill a need in the area. 

Overall I think this place has potential. They have everything they need to be successful right there. They just need to tighten a couple things up. I will give them a few weeks to work out the kinks and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went here last night , the beers we're good .  The outsider patio is nice.   The short rib Tacos were not edible ..  They fell apart as soon as I picked them up.  The meat was dry and tasteless .  The server took them off the bill .  I would never order food here.   With so many other choices, don't see a reason to go back."}
{"text":"Good food, wide variety of beers on tap.  High street is underrated, my wife and love going there for Sunday Fun day!!"}
{"text":"Beer was great!!  Food and service was not as good by far.  Server didn't know which beer the four of us ordered.  Server had to be flagged down any time we wanted anything from another beer to condiments once we were able get his attention once we did get our food.  Order was mixed up.  The food was average. But you're there for the beer. The beer was excellent. The flights were very nice.  You can choose up to 6.  Reasonable prices.  Lots of locals on tap. So great choices for anyone in your group. The outdoor ambience was great and the inside looked okay.  We were there on a Thursday night so not as busy probably as a Friday/Saturday.  We joked that maybe the \"A-team\" worked those days and we had the \"B-team\".  Still good enough to go back and give it another try.


Apparently, they were short staffed on the Thursday night we went.  This came from management who seems to care about their business and its customers experience and feedback. My review was read and comment upon. Thank you for your explanation.  I will be back and of course will bring friends."}
