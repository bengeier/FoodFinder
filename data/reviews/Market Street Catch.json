{"text":"This place isn't far from my work, so I've been here quite a few times. I almost always get something from the grill, so my review is based on nothing from the fry menu. 

I LOVE the freshness of the fish. And fresh fish with that char/bbq taste? One of my favourite things in the world! And I'm a fan of the coleslaw and salad. That red mayo-y sauce that comes with the Arctic char is pretty flavourful. Not a fan of the salad dressing (some default balsamic vinegar type of dressing I think?), so I just use that red sauce instead. 

The price is a bit high for what it is though, so definitely 1 star deducted for that. 

Also, if you eat inside the restaurant, be prepared to come out smelling like smokey grill."}
{"text":"Frozen fish. Frozen potatoes. Unacceptable for fish & chips in the year 2014, and especially when it's $14. Super, super greasy. These people didn't even have the grease frier hot enough - even a rookie knows that's important.

I got 2 rectangular pieces of fish. Looked like it came out of a High Liner package from No Frills. Rubbery texture; telltale sign it frozen, not fresh. Comes with a flavourless batter as thick as cardboard. This is what you expect for $6 at a dive. I admire family run businesses, but the food quality - worse than an army kitchen - is an insult and completely unacceptable.

This place is nowhere close to, say, Chippy's or The One That Got Away, in terms of quality. Very poor food, and robbery at $14."}
{"text":"Many options of fresh fish. The type of sandwich you get on vacation by the beach.
Grilled options are tastier. 
It's fairly expensive. 
The waitress misheard my order, when I asked to change, all the staff gave me attitude: the customer service was bad."}
{"text":"My gf intended to bring me here on my b-day but that's long pass, and its conveniently close to my work, so we came by for lunch on a friday. 

The menu is quite similar to 'Buster Sea Cove' inside the St. Lawrence Market. We tried quite a few things as usual turning to be a more expensive lunch.

Lobster Bisque ($7.95)- You can definitely taste the flavour of the lobster in there. I wished there was lobster meat inside, but its a bisque. Some may say its salty, like my Mom, but I thought its in between that.
(Score)

3 Taco Plate ($15)- You can pick octopus, tuna, shrimp or halibut. It goes with slaw and some sauces i don't recall. The octopus is alright to me. The tuna is seared medium rare and it tasted alright, but not completely fresh if you know what i mean. The best tasting out of all taco is the halibut which is deep fried.
(Hit-N-Miss)

Oyster Po Boy ($10.95)- This was one recommended by the cashier. I thought it was alright. The fried oyster didn't have any flavour, a bit bland.
(Missed)

Grilled Calamari w/Fries ($13.95)- The calamari was nice tasting, it reminded us of eating at 'Astoria' the way they grill their calamari. The fries is just meh. The sauce that comes with the calamari is nice though, but strong in garlic flavour
(Score)

Funny thing is when my gf was paying by credit card, there was option on 'tips' and she wasn't sure if she had to tip or not, but she did at the end...Bill was $57+ before tip.

I'd come back and try other things next time, but maybe once every 2 weeks or a month. Its a bit more than what I prefer to spend on lunch that is a take-out joint style.

3.5/5 is my score for the food here!"}
{"text":"Terrible.
Location and decor is great, but the food is terrible. I had the fish and chips (The Fry). The chips were your standard fries and were enjoyable, but the small portion of slaw it came with was really bland, and most importantly, the fish...ew.They charge such a premium price (I think my total for just the fish and chips was around $14 with tax incl.), but they used such a paper thin filet of fish that it was sooooo dry. The batter was super hard and tough that all I tasted was the batter, and the haddock was overfried/cooked that it was really dry, like it was dehydrated beforehand. Whole point of good fish and chips is moist fish inside a crispy batter that doesn't scratch the roof of your mouth. Seriously, I had a hard time cutting through the batter with my knife! The knife couldn't cut the batter, actually. The batter would crack under the pressure of my knife, because it was so hard.

Service was meh. No one smiled ever. They were all like. \"K, here\" lol.

Will never return. Food is bad and overpriced."}
{"text":"I went to Market Street Catch on a whim tonight after the gym, and I was surprised by the quality of their fresh fish (and I'm a native New Englander from the coast).  From the outside, Market Street Catch looks like a typical bodega/quicky-cafe, and that seems to be the ambiance on the inside.  But service was good, the prices were better, and food arrived rapidly:  so that was enough to impress me.  There is a decent variety of fresh fish - I went for the grilled salmon with salad - and the portion size was ample.  Just a main was enough to fill me up.  The only place I'd knock Market Street Catch down a point was that the decor was a bit too fast-foody, but then they wouldn't be able to offer these prices if it was more upmarket.  

I'd definitely recommend Market Street Catch if you are looking for a quick seafood meal that isn't pre-prepared."}
{"text":"The market didn't have any good sit down options across the street so we decided to go here. The prices were very reasonable for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"The shrimp taco and Po ' boys are delicious!! Can't wait to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Not sure why the stars are so low on this place. This is a newer restaurant that has come into the neighbourhood and its pretty delicious. Im not sure how the octopus would be but I usually get the coconut shrimp and its consistently delicious. You get a fair amount of food which is good, the prices are decent for seafood- maybe a little high. The service is fine, I see it more as a takeout or lunch place, its not incredible service but you wouldn't think twice about it. There may be some one off experiences but as a whole a great place to grab some seafood."}
{"text":"Overall good place, chill atmosphere and cheerful workers.  I like their beer and pop selection.  Had lobster bisque and it was ok, needs at least one chunk of lobster on top.  I also had cod fish fry with fries and the fish was great.  Nice batter, without being too greasy.  Had fries that weren't bad, but wish I had a salad because salads look amazing. It's not cheap, but not a rip off either.  I'd go back for sure and they just need a small push to get a perfect 5 from me."}
{"text":"3/5! I Recommend the three tacos. Great for a quick bite before a night out. I enjoyed the grilled tilapia, shrimp and seared tuna. The fish portion was less in comparison to the taco but with all the toppings and the shell --- it was very filling! This is a good alternative to the vendors in the St Lawrence market itself as it's often difficult to find seating in the market."}
{"text":"The Oxford Dictionary defines catch as:  to intercept and seize; take hold of something. Well folks, the fine establishment known as Market Street Catch will seize your taste buds, heart and a bit of your wallet... Now for full disclosure I have to say that I'm new to the seafood game. The first 25 years of my life I was under the impression that I didn't like seafood but I have realized the error in my ways and Market Street Catch only reaffirms that. 

I have been to Market Street Catch numerous times and I have tried the fried haddock sandwich, the swordfish sandwich, the fish and chips, lobster grilled cheese and various tacos. Everything that I have tasted has been delicious; I even find the coleslaw really good. I would say my favourite item is probably the swordfish sandwich but it is a very difficult decision. The fries are a bit thinner and flimsy (more like a McDonald's type fry) and I prefer the thicker fries that you get from chip wagons but they are still good. 

It is also a bit on the expensive side but the food is very good and every time I have gone I have been impressed with the service. 

Overall, I would say this place is a whale of a good time, it definitely gets my seal of approval and even though it's a bit pricey I will be back to fish some money out of my wallet."}
{"text":"A very disappointing meal. I had high hopes when I first walked in, as it smelled really good inside. The menu had some interesting  (though pricey) items but I decided to start with something fairly basic so I ordered the halibut & fries ($13.95). The portion of fish was small and flat, the batter was chewy and tough to cut through and the halibut was very dry and bland. Also extremely bland was the coleslaw that came on the side. The fries were okay. 

At $18 total when combined with a can of Coke, I kind of felt like I was just ripped off; I couldn't even bother to finish most of it and probably would have asked for my money back if my parking metre wasn't about to expire. 

I would definitely not recommend this place; the other stuff on the menu might be good but I will not be returning to find out."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food is really good but the service X?$&@?

The ditzy cashier got my order wrong and then insisted she didn't. No apologies no solutions. The 'manager' had the same deer-caught-in-the-headlights blank expression. He said we should have known that the cashier was talking about a different dish when she asked if we wanted salad or fries - WHAT ??? Obviously he had no solution. The owner who stepped out from behind the scenes proposed that we pay the difference between what I actually ordered and what we got. But we had to line up all over again to get what we actually ordered.  That said the owner disappeared into the back again.  

By then we were so hungry we couldn't stick around. Don't go if you are hungry!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Rubbery haddock, and chips were soggy. We basically spent $15 for salad bc the piece of salmon was no bigger than my index finger and maybe 2 inches wide. Decor is nice and there are many menu options. If the rest of the menu is anything like the poor quality of our meals, well...save your money."}
{"text":"Popped in for a take away lunch today amd the service was quick and friendly. I ordered a fried haddock sandwich. I liked that the batter on the fish wasn't too thick and the toppings, which included a kind of salsa, cucumber and mayo, were really great. The bread it came on tasted good but it was really chewy way to tough for the delicate fish and veggies. I had to basically crush the sandwich to death to bite through the bread and food was slopping out of it everywhere. Sandwiches are served with an awful coleslaw. Mine tasted a bit off, kind of musty/moldy. This is probably from overuse of some kind of oregano/parsley/ greek spice stuff but I didn't chance it and just chucked out the slaw. The sandwich made for a decent lunch and for $10 I don't feel as if i've wasted my money. I think this spot warrants a second try."}
{"text":"O so very disappointing. This is the first time I have returned a meal for a long time.
I ordered the Fish Basket (not cheap) but everything was breadcrumb coated & then deep fried to a crisp, so it was difficult to determine the flavours between the different types of fish/seafood because everything was bland & tasteless. Certainly will not be returning and/or recommending to my other foodie friends, but fortunately the other new places on Market Street look and taste a lot more interesting."}
{"text":"Three visits while in Toronto for one week.  Grilled items are perfectly cooked, cole slaw is terrific. Sat near a family from another country. The father stated this was the best meal of their trip. I couldn't agree more. I tried the trout, the salmon, and the arctic char, all three grilled and in a sandwich. Delicious hot sauces available on the table and all items can come spiced during the grilling. I tried the salmon grilled spicy and liked it. My friend enjoyed the place too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm starting to see why it's getting low scores on the reviews. Service was fine, so im not sure why people complain about it. 

The food, on the other hand, wasn't great at all. 
I ordered the three fish tacos, and they apparently ran out of seared tuna. Really? You're literally beside a supermarket and a fresh market, and you run out of tuna? 

That wasn't my biggest problem. When the fish tacos arrived, it looked ok. But the problem is with how it was done. The piece of fish should not be deep fried, it should be pan fried and seasoned...same with the shrimp. If its deep fried, it loses its original flavour. All I tasted was their salsa and vegetables.

Overall, the price is ridiculous. Fish tacos should be a la carte, and water should at least be free if you're going to offer tables and seats for people to sit."}
{"text":"Woah! Delicious! 

Had the grilled halibut sandwich. To die for. Saucy and flavourful with a nice balance of sweet coleslaw on the side. 

Great service, very friendly staff and fast."}
{"text":"I believe the place is known more for its grilled items.  We. Ordered the tacos with shrimp,  halibut and tuna.  It was so so.. Nothing spectacular really.  Next time I go,  I know I will be ordering something else and will try to stay away from the tacos."}
{"text":"I am confused about prior posts about this place. We went for dinner today and the food was great. A bonus is that the seafood comes straight from St.Lawrence market, across the street. The kitchen staff is friendly and informative.  The cash wad handled by very young girls who are learning their way around customer service. 

The seafood is clean and coooked beautifully. The seasoning is balanced too. 

My only sticking point is that the resto needs better ventilation to ensure we don't leave smelling like a deep fryer.

Overall - delish!  I would come back."}
{"text":"I used to work around this area and it's pretty exciting to see some diversity with the lunch time food options. First off, this place has a really good menu. Lots of fried and grilled seafood/fish options. It's not exactly cheap, but I would say standard for a decent seafood meal. 

the 3 taco plate was really well done (shrimp, tuna, octopus). Very well seasoned, but I was a bit disappointed that the shrimp is fried and not grilled.

Lobster roll was ok. I found it over-salted, which overpowered the lobster taste, which made me kind of sad. 

It's not amazing, but it's a good option if you're in the area and looking for a casual seafood place that won't cost $50 /person"}
{"text":"Consistently hits my craving for fried shrimp sammies. I usually order take-out to eat on the picnic tables upstairs at the market. It takes maximum seven minutes to make and I'm off. It's the same owners as the Buster's Sea Cove food truck and St. Lawrence Market restaurant so it's the same healthy portion of fries, coleslaw (though lately they've become a bit stingy!), and of course delicious fresh seafood. 
I'd recommend doing take-out or ordering something low-key. It's a very casual restaurant where you order up at the front and sit at whatever table you can find. To avoid disappointment, don't order the chardonnay and the $20+ fish dish."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, tried for first time today.  Got the halibut and chips.  Was a nice, large portion that was very filling . Fries on the soggy side but tasty nonetheless.  Good central location near many neat attractions.  Friendly staff and quick service too."}
{"text":"This place was popping at lunch time, around 12 pm, on a Saturday. Seafood looks fresh. For my first time there, Iordered the Lobster Poutine ($18).

The good: 
- Great portion size (super stuffed); and
- Cheesy decadence;

The bad:
- Very little lobster. The whole thing probably consisted of only a halloween-KitKat-bar-sized piece of lobster."}
{"text":"Its a good idea and concept but the food misses the mark. The tacos weren't exciting, fries tasted stale and the calamari didn't taste fresh. Service was particularly slow at rush hour and staff wasn't sympathetic. This place has potential, but more work to do."}
{"text":"Ordered lobster rigatoni but there's literally no lobster. I called them right away but the woman answering my call didn't believe me and hung up on me. \"it's shredded\" she said. Um unless it has been pulverized, there's no way there's lobster in there."}
{"text":"Probably the worst fish and chips I've ever had. The halibut was very dry rather than juicy, and the batter was so thick you really needed a hacksaw to cut through it. Definitely not recommended. Why we put up with such bad food in Toronto I've no idea. A place like this wouldn't last five minutes in New York."}
{"text":"Fresh seafood for resonable price. Market street has a nice patio that is enjoyable during summer time. Quiet getaway from the city. I tried grilled seafood salad and it was very tasty."}
{"text":"I live in the area and was excited when I saw this place (being in Toronto I am a little seafood-deprived and I am from the west coast!). 

I have been there twice now. First time was about 6 months ago and I ordered fish and chips (halibut). The fish was greasy (ok I get it is supposed to be greasy but it was the type of greasiness when something's not fresh) and the fries was lukewarm. Not impressed at all. The second visit was recent and this time I ordered their calamari with fried. The calamari was underwhelming to say the least! There's no seasoning at all. 

I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"I often order from here for pick-up. Go-to order is the spicy grilled salmon sandwich with a side of fries. The sandwich is always spot on, but the fries and particularly the coleslaw can be a bit inconsistent. At their best, the skinny fries are golden and well seasoned, and the coleslaw is lightly dressed in a creamy/tangy dressing that leaves plenty of crunch. When off, either (or both) are limp and bland. Lately, they've been more on top of things, and both sides come out great.
Buster's Sea Cove might taste a bit better, as other reviewers have mentioned, but for convenience's sake I'd much rather order this through Ritual and skip the crazy lines in the Market proper."}
{"text":"Just ate at Market St Catch, and Wow!! We live in the area, go to Buster's often, but the choices/quality/flavours of everything we had were amazing!!
Really, for good quality seafood, so fresh, it was very reasonable as well.
We had the Lobster Bisque which is the best I've had, Grilled Calamari with Greek salad (which was so much, we almost couldn't finish it-who ever says that about seafood!), which the seasoning was fantastic on the calamari, just perfect, and tacos of octopus, halibut and seared tuna. The tacos were very authentic (I lived in Mexico and good Mexican cuisine is so hard to come by in T.O) with fresh corn tortillas, perfect salsa (pico de gallo) and spice and the fish was all cooked perfectly!! The octopus was my fave :) we took the key lime pie home as we were too full to eat it there, and it was absolutely delicious, made by their in house pastry chef I was told, and came in this cute little mason jar. I will definitely be back, and often. In my opinion, best dining option in the area by far!! Superb!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were 15 $.. but they were the worst fish tacos i ever had . The halibut was  battered super heavy and very tasteless. The octopus was over cooked . The shrimp was tasty but also over cook. I threw was most of my meal. Expected way better !"}
{"text":"Ordered the halibut and fries. Halibut was dense and dry - the opposite of what fresh halibut should taste like. The fries were limp and greasy. Overpriced and nauseatingly greasy. Instead go around the corner to Jack Astors for fish and chips."}
{"text":"Large portions but very oily even the grilled options. Also my friend found a long hair in her dish! I would have given this place at least a 3/5 if it wasn't for the hair. I guess you get what you pay for cause the dishes were relatively cheap as far as fish goes."}
{"text":"Come to mama! The oyster po'boy was sooooo damn delicious! Order it spicy. Adds a nice kick to it! I also tasted their lobster poutine and they didn't cheap out on the lobster meat! Annnnd I also tried their fried and fresh calamari. I'm biased to the fried. Also, the portions were larger with the fried calamari. My gfs  didn't finish their serving so the took it home. Potions are great! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Sunday. Service was good. We ordered grilled calamari and salad, red snapper and fries. Red snapper was over grilled almost burnt and fish portion was small. We have had better."}
{"text":"I used to like this place a lot. Not anymore! Last Friday my friend and I went there for lunch. I ordered seafood plate for me and red snapper plate for my friend. I was first in line and there was a company of 7 people behind me. We sat and waited and waited, I noticed that all orders for uber, ritual and even the people order after me already got their orders. I came over to ask when our order will be ready and they told me they are swamped it's coming. The truth is that they most likely forgot about this order. After almost 50 minutes wait  we finally got our order and my seafood plate was COLD! And this is what we for for $50 for lunch - cold meal! Unacceptable. Not coming back and won't recommend it to other. Huge disappointment...

I also forgot to mention that my grilled seafood platter should have octopus in it but it wasn't there and calamari was not cooked well..."}
{"text":"Hours are dead wrong. My girlfriend really wanted to try this place, so we came last Saturday an hour before close and arrived at a locked door. OK, fair enough, so this Saturday we arrive 2 1/2 hours early. We are getting a line just behind somebody ordering food for eating in and once they're finished we start to order. We are immediately told that will have to order to go as they're not serving any more food for eating in. We came pretty far so basically are being told you need to eat your food cold. Inconvenient, especially since the person immediately in front of us had the privilege of eating in but whatever. The last straw was when I try to order something from the favourites menu and I'm told literally none of it is available at the moment. Thanks for telling me that upfront after my girlfriend had already placed her order. The food was OK but it was freezing cold by the time we were able to eat it. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Slightly more casual than I had anticipated -- you place your order up front and they'll bring it to your table if you're dining in. Food app delivery/pickup also available.

There's a good amount of options here: rolls, grilled seafood on salad or with fries, fried seafood sandwiches with salad or fries, and even a couple of pasta options. 

The grilled Arctic char was delicious, cooked and seasoned just right. Came with lightly dressed salad and good amount of coleslaw, with a wedge of lemon and some sort of spicy mayo on the side (not really necessary). The lobster roll was disappointing: more shredded meat than I had expected and roll not that buttery. Fries are not bad and comes with a couple pickle spears as well. Portions are filling (maybe too much so for lunch but def enough for dinner), and they are generous with the portions of the sides.

The counter towards the back allows you to see the raw seafood which is cool."}
{"text":"very disappointing. Ordered fried cod, it's not fresh, smell so bad. Low quality frozen fish!"}
{"text":"A pricier alternative when u don't wanna line up @ buster's.  The food here is decent but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Having a craving for fish and chips for weeks, i was pleasantly surprised by this new fish and chips place, as downtown Toronto is seriously lacking a good fish and chips joint. 

Sadly this place did not provide me with the fish and chips fix i so desperately hoped for. I popped in on April 25th, and was the only customer in the store, i ordered the Halibut and fries and eagerly awaited my food, to my surprise the food was cooked incredibly fast. But to my disappointment upon closer inspection, the halibut came in 3 small thin and oddly shaped pieces. The batter was OK, but the fish was cut too thin and it was not as fresh as i had hoped. Unfortunately the fish had a slight fishy after taste and fishy aroma. Which means only one thing, the fish was not fresh. The oddly shaped pieces seemed to me like they were odds and ends and not fresh cuts from the fillet like most of us are used to when we go to a respectable fish and chips joint. This place also owns buster sea cove inside the market. Now it's quite possible that i could have been one of very few customers that day since they just opened, but the odd pieces still scream scrap meat to me. Which was very disappointing. 

The second and very disappointing part of the meal was that it was not served with tartar sauce, they did however have coleslaw with it, but it was not very good at all, it seemed to have way too much Greek dry spices in it that really didn't work, a basic vinegar or creamy coleslaw would have been just fine. 

And the third disappointment was their fries, a fish and chips shop absolutely must make fresh double fried french fries, unfortunately for Market Street catch, they made the decision to serve frozen skin on fries instead of fresh cut, and this was a massive disappointment, it just seems really lazy of them to be honest. Especially for $16 after tax, one would expect/demand fresh food, and especially being associated with the market, you'd expect it to be nothing but fresh food coming out of this place. sadly that is not the case here. I will say they had a glass display stand with other seafood on ice which looked fresh, but that halibut was absolutely not.

In conclusion i don't believe this place warrants another try as the fries were pretty terrible, and considering they are unlikely to go to fresh cut in the foreseeable future,  (which is the only reason i'd try it again if they started serving fresh cut fries.) I'll pass on this place.

You're better off sticking with Fresco's in Kensington or British Style near Coxwell and Dundas, both of those places do fish and chips 100% right, these guys at market street catch should drop by and see what they are doing, and copy it, they may be able to turn things around if they did it like those guys. They'd likely have line ups out the door in this neighbourhood if they did. So unless this place ups their game in a big way, then I'll stay far away from it.

Either way, Highliner frozen fish and chips from the supermarket is as good as the fish this place serves. Ultimately your money would be better served if you donated it to legitimate charity than give it away to this place..."}
{"text":"If you are new to Toronto (or you live outside of Toronto), you will be amazed at the popularity of the St. Lawrence Market.  It does not reflect the bustling city life of Toronto, but boasts a culture of good food and warm-loving vendors.  Once you step into the area or even the building, you would find yourself emersed into a different area.  The food here isn't expensive, nor is it considered fine dining but the quality is superb.

[Service]
You place your order, grab a number, and wait to be served.  Most people order to-go, but eating inside the restaurant is cool too.  The only caveat is that the restaurant is quite small and in the winter times, every door swing will bring in a gust of wind.  In other words, it's frigg'n cold to dine-in unless you sit away from the door.

[Food]
Their seafood is great.  My only concern is that the stuff can be too salty.  Portions are nice.  I love their fries!  They are thin and crunchy, yum yum.  I have been here twice and the squid is honestly their best dish.  Overall, pretty good food, but I would choose to do take-out instead."}
{"text":"Walked by, saw the name, the food on customers plates and stopped in to give Market Catch a chance...so glad we did. The food was outstanding, fresh, and flavourful. We ordered the calamari po'boy and the taco trio (octopus, tuna and shrimp) and it was by far the best we've ever had. The restaurant atmosphere was great, staff friendly and we loved being able to see the fresh seafood displayed. 100% going back soon!"}
{"text":"We decided to head here for dinner since we were in the area, and I had heard that this place opened up recently. I have to give this place a 2.5 since the second dish we had wasn't great.

Tacos 3/5
I ordered the taco plate, which includes 3 tacos. I got the seared tuna, halibut, and octopus served on coleslaw. The portions of protein were fairly big, and each taco has 2 corn tortillas. I actually enjoyed the tacos, they were tasty, seasoned nicely, and had good flavouring. They also had a nice spicy kick, that was not overwhelming but added a nice heat to the tacos. May favourite tacos were the tuna and the halibut. 

Seafood platter 1/5
Seafood platter was not good. Everything on the dish was bland and lacked flavour. The seafood platter comes with octopus, swordfish, shrimp, squid, and your choice of fries, salad or coleslaw. The swordfish was over cooked and dry. The whole dish needed more salt. The coleslaw that was served was a bit soggy, bland, and tasteless. For $24 this was not worth it. 

I do like they way that the kitchen is open, and that you can see the chefs cooking. The place has a nice patio and some seating inside if you choose to dine in."}
{"text":"So impressed with the quality of the seafood.  Came here for lunch and had the lobster pasta and halibut fish and chips.  It was fresh and delicious and such a good price.  I will be back here again and again.  This is the regular store front of the owner of Buster's Sea cove so you can get your seafood fix any time.  They cook it right in front of you so you can anticipate the deliciousness.  So worth a wait.  

Very happy that it is close to the neighbourhood and in such a picturesque street too!"}
{"text":"I go as often as I can for lunch, and always  get the Fried Haddock sandwich. It is absolutely incredible. The fish is plentiful, hot and fresh.  By the end of the day I just want to go back and get another. It's the best part about working in the neighbourhood.  I'll definitely miss it when I move.  It's worth a visit if you're near St.Lawrence market."}
{"text":"I was absolutely ecstatic when I heard that Buster's Sea Cove has open a restaurant. I have craved buster's on Sundays on multiple occasions and merely having a place I can go to for the same level of food on Sundays was exciting to me. However, it really just stop there. 

I do want to say that the food itself was great, and food quality is not the reason why I gave this place a mere 3 stars.

The restaurant is fast food style, the kinda u need to order first before sitting down. All the cutlery, plates are generic, and the sauces came in the same plastic cup as buster's.

The table were not clean before we sat down. (The were only 3 tables full when we walk in so no excuses) Our table were missing half of of the condiments. And no one came around during the entire meal to refill water. (The water is behind the counter and you cannot get it yourself.)

The entire place just feel like the owner cannot decided if this place should be a full fast food place or a restaurant.

If this would to be a fast food place, I would like to see more options on the menu (bring the full buster's menu please!) Water in customer accessible area, and just don't bother with actual plates.

Or if this would to be a full restaurant, I would expect more on the atmosphere, services, and food that are more unique and memorable."}
{"text":"Came here with my partner as we where in the area... found it over priced came to $65 after his tip which u pay b4 u get your food... I found the food overall just too dried out... I'm from the uk so as a britt I may have higher expectations with fish and chips had some good in Canada tho this place did not hit the mark..."}
{"text":"Very good portion sizes, a little pricey considering its a seat-yourself, order-at-counter place.
Fresh seafood considering its Toronto, but by no means my favourite."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place only has 3 stars on Yelp, we LOVED it!!!  Super fresh seafood at excellent prices.  In addition to the killer lobster bisque, we ordered the lobster grilled cheese and the grilled arctic char.  Both sandwiches were dee-lish and we loved dipping them in the bisque as we munched.  The fries were crispy and piping hot, and the coleslaw was crunchy and fresh.

The St. Lawrence Market was our final stop on a 3-day visit to Toronto; right after we finished lunch (this place is right next door to the market), we took Uber to the airport to fly home.  It was a great last meal and we will definitely eat here again on our next trip!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go when you want to eat good seafood in Toronto on a budget. Easy going and nice ambiance - def a great place to hang out with friends on Friday evening after work. Try their yummy seafood platter, clams and mussels in wine and tomato sauce, chowder, and seafood pasta. The food is just so good!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Small place in the cobble stone street next to St. Lawrence market. It was brightly lit and inviting with some seating but not alot. We ordered the grilled seafood platter with salad and a side of fries. They have sugar cane drinks in old style glass bottles too. The fries were skinny and perfectly fried. The platter we ordered was enough for two. It came with one large prawn, a single thin portion of swordfish,  two octopus tentacles, and two large calamari on a bed of salad and coleslaw. It came with three small sauces. I found the sauces (sweet and spicy, spicy mayo, and tzatziki) to be unnecessary but for those who like sauces, it's a good addition to try different flavours. The food was delicious, however I found the salad to be slightly overdressed and the swordfish salty. Everything else was excellent. The grill on the seafood was good, not tough. Service was somewhat quick for a half empty restaurant on a Friday night. Would definitely come back to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Had to increase my ratings after having their grilled sardines.  Amazing. 
The fish was very fresh. Delivered in the morning. Spiced perfectly and grilled to the right crispness.

Not a big fan of fries and fried food in general. But the fries tastes good.  not too over fried or soggy"}
{"text":"LOVE their salads and grilled fish sandwiches. Fine dining quality fish for fast food prices, can't go wrong with that and always consistent. My favorite place to eat at the St.Lawrence Market!"}
{"text":"A great little seafood gem beside St. Lawrence Market.  The staff are always great and the food is super fresh, hot, and tasty.  Highly recommend the grilled salmon sandwich with spicy sauce or the seafood linguine!!  Fries are also to die for.  Cute decor and chill ambience makes for a cute date spot."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on take-out food delivery orders (through the app Foodora) from this place. Located right beside St. Lawrence Market, I've ordered for delivery from this place several times and, each time, the food was delicious, well-prepared, and satisfying. 

First, the service. Although I haven't actually eaten in, the communications and service I've had from this location each time I ordered in has been excellent. When they ran out of certain items I ordered online, I received a call directly to my cell phone from the restaurant, within minutes, apologizing and letting me know that they were out of their red snapper, or with other suggestions from their menu. Very professional, prompt, and helpful.

Second, the actual food. I've always ordered the Halibut with Fries ($13.95) and, each time, both the fish and the chips were crispy, light, and so delicious. Obviously, don't expect the healthiest meal in the word (the take-out container definitely had blots of oil all over it) - but the batter wasn't heavy at all, and the fish was cooked perfectly.

I would definitely eat in when I have a chance, and would order (and recommend) the Halibut with Fries again!"}
{"text":"While helping a friend last weekend, she suggested getting take-out from Market Street Catch next to St Lawrence Market. I was a bit surprised when I got there, as I had assumed from passing by a few times that it was a sit-down restaurant, but it's more like a serving counter with a few tables and stools by an eating counter. It was also quite loud inside, but not because of the customers, but from the cooking equipment behind the counter. The lady behind the counter was also quite distracted; she had to step away twice in the time it took me to order 2 meals for take-out. So not the best start, but things did get better from there. The wait was not very long, although there was a steady stream of customers coming through.

The menu had lots of options: 7-8 different types of fish available in sandwiches or from the grill, along with shrimp and lobster and several seafood pastas. My friend had been there before so had requested the grilled tilapia sandwich, and after some indecision, I decided to try the grilled swordfish (over the lobster poutine). We both had the side of fries (salad is also available) and coleslaw. They also have a selection of craft beers on display, but not sure if they serve other alcohol.

I had never had swordfish before, but it was excellent. Two large pieces of fish, tender and well-cooked, with some lemon and very nice tartar sauce; the fries and coleslaw were good too. I quite enjoyed my entire meal. My friend also seemed to enjoy her tilapia sandwich. The total bill was $30 for two meals, so I think a good price for fresh seafood. I am sure that I will return to try some other types of grilled fish or seafood pastas."}
{"text":"Great alternative when Busters in the market is busy! On the beautifully quaint market street and with a great little patio on the side walk in the summer. 

I got the special sandwich of the day that came with grilled shrimp and smoke salmon and it was stuffed! The shrimp were juicy and good sized with spicy sauce on top. It also came with a ton of toppings on top like avocado and pica de gaio and arugula on a lightly toasted hot dog style bun. The seafood is fresh! and the serving was large but it set me back a little more than $20 for a lunch. You can also add a side salad for an extra $3 but most sandwiches come with coleslaw (which I wish they tell you) Its also a casual place where you order at the counter which for $20+ feels not as nice.

I've also gotten take out catering from here before, different types of fish sandwiches and its definitely not the same as eating it in store, the bread is a bit soggier and the fish is colder and just not as good but a good sandwich option for office catering. 

Its a great place if you are in the area for lunch (much better than other seafood sandwich places in the city)"}
{"text":"The fish is dry. Been here twice with two people and it's been the same both times. You can make better fish for way less. Go get food at the market instead"}
{"text":"Great place. Busy on Sunday afternoon. Friendly people. The food was very good. Had fish with fries. Very good. Grilled Arctic Char sandwich was amazing. Very moist and flavourful. The Oyster PO Boy sandwich was also amazing."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Come here about once a month for a quick meal of fish and chips. Typically get the breaded and fried halibut or haddock. Food here is consistently good and portions are quite large."}
{"text":"Yummy yum yums.  This place is great!  While visiting Toronto for the first time, my husband came upon this little gem via Yelp.  I'm super glad he did!  We ate here 3 times over the weekend!  Had a fish fry the first time, and po'boy the second and sandwich the last.  My husband had the fish fry basket as well.  All of them were superb.  My only thing to add, do not order a side of coleslaw.  All the dishes come with it and quite a serving as is.  A side of coleslaw is totally unnecessary.  I would know, I'm the idiot who ordered it along with one of my meals.  Needless to say, I barely touched it."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get some decent sea food. It is very similar to the food they have at Buster's Sea cove. 

I usually get a grilled salmon or tilapia sandwich with hot sauce (its not that hot)."}
{"text":"Really good food.  Octopus was interesting, less rubbery than a grilled calamari. $23 for a seafood platter, portion was small, had to fill up on fries to feel full."}
{"text":"Decided to try the crab cake sandwich today which cost $13 and comes with a tiny side of coleslaw. It looks identical to the crab cake sandwich at busters sea cove inside St. Lawrence market. However the one from BSC tastes better (despite having the same owner) and costs 20% less ($10) so I will probably just buy my crab cake sandwiches there.

Will not be back"}
{"text":"Got the grilled seafood platter with fries and the catch of the day (Norwegian black cod) with Caesar salad for dinner to share with my boyfriend. 

It was a satisfying dinner, especially at this price point! The seafood tasted fresh and was properly seasoned. The platter came with a sizeable amount of refreshing coleslaw and fresh fries with extra dipping sauces. 

If we wanted to be healthier, we could have gotten the garden salad. Instead, we drowned in the copious, but delicious amount, of Caesar dressing. Let's say we made it up by having restricted access to mayonaise to dip our fries in because they don't carry it, only chipotle mayo."}
{"text":"Great patio right by St. Lawrence market. Nice, quaint surroundings. Like how they're revitalizing the are.

 The seafood is fresh. Try the Lobster poutine! Honestly the portions are huge. Big enough to share with 2-3 people. And you can't go wrong with fish and chips. One of the better places in the area."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend and we were both super impressed by the selection. I went with the swordfish and salad and was blown away by the portion and price. Super reasonable for great food. Paired it with a pint of 416 organic. Awesome, would totally go back!"}
{"text":"I was craving calamari after work drinks, so I made a bee line to this little gem. I'm so glad that this option is available, so I can access freshly cooked seafood even after St. Lawrence Market is closed for the day. 

For $13, you can get a plate of fresh salad with a mound of fried calamari on top. The calamari is tender, crispy and goes perfectly with the simple salad underneath. The portion was so large that I ended up taking half of it home for lunch the next day. My partner in crime had the halibut steak with fries and he loved the freshly grilled fish. I stole fries and they were great! 

Definite recommendation for reasonably priced seafood in the city!"}
{"text":"Had a snapper sandwich w/ fries, both of which were fresh and tasty. The included slaw was weird and not as good as their owner Buster's across the street.

The calamari salad was very lightly dressed, came w/ the same weird slaw. The calamari was ok, but cut into thin rings instead of wider cut rings."}
{"text":"Ordered the calamari po'boy and taco trio (octopus, tuna and shrimp) and they were equally amazing. The shrimp taco was the best I've ever had and I've had a lot. The tuna was so tender and the octopus complimented so well with really fresh ingredients. No complaints. Atmosphere was cool, place was busy on a Sunday afternoon and the staff friendly. Delicious."}
{"text":"Really liked the food and atmosphere! It was a casual dine in where you ordered at the counter and they bring you your food. They're all really nice. Lots of varieties on the menu (mainly seafood of course!) I had the oyster po boy, seafood chowder and also the grilled octopus. All very good. Reminds me of eating by a harbour or marina."}
{"text":"The worst greasiest fries on the planet. 
Fish was ok but do not get the grease laden fries. Ate a few of them and waitress asked how things were and told her. She just sighed and took the plate filled with fries not eaten away. Also they did not de-scale the fish so plate was messy with fish scales. Not at all professional cooks. Very poor experience."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, don't get the haddock. It comes so overlooked it's impossible to cut or chew. Completely inedible. I basically spent $15 for some fries and mediocre coleslaw. The halibut is decent, get that if you want fish and chips."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  For years I have been a fan and a regular across the road at Buster's Seacove, where the halibut on a bun may be the best lunch in Toronto.  So I was excited to sit on the patio at Market Street Catch on one of the first spring-like days of the year.  The menu is a bit different than Busters -- and I must say the staff was friendly and helpful. I opted for the fish tacos with seared tuna and halibut (shrimp and octopus available too).  When the plate reached my table on the patio it looked good, certainly big.  But the tacos fell down due to the condiments, especially the salsa which could have been out of a jar.  The tuna was fresh and cooked well, no problem there, and the tacos fresh and soft, but the white fish was marred with a ton of batter, and again the condiments were sorry.  Maybe I mis-ordered and should have gone for the halibut with fries or salad and compared it to Busters.  But I wanted something different and the tacos head the menu."}
{"text":"I've been to Market Street Catch twice now this summer with my boyfriend since we live about a stone's throw away. 

The first time the experience was average, I ordered the grilled octopus with salad and he had the fried octopus with fries. Food was decent and service was quick, so no complaints there, that's why we returned last night with a friend for the second time last night.

We did our orders at the cash register, fast and painless. We sat down at a table that looked seemingly clean outside. Shortly after we sat down, the server (a blonde girl with a pony tail, has a chubby physique and looked fairly young) came to our table and said to us \"this is not cleaned, you shouldn't be sitting here\". We looked at her and waited for her to give us an alternative solution, she didn't, instead she stood in front of our legs, squeezed in, wiped the table in front of us. A bit weird and inappropriate, but sure. 

Then she came out with one of our orders (not all three together) and dumped it on the table, while we were trying to decipher whose food it is (since two people ordered fish and fries) my boyfriend ended up taking the food. Then she came out again in three minutes, looked really rushed, and said \"two salmon sandwiches with salads\". Me and my friend exchanged some looks and said \"that's not ours\". She looked annoyed and asked to see our receipts to prove we weren't making it up. She went back in, exchanged some words with the kitchen, and came back again. 

This time she put the salmon sandwiches at the table behind us (turns out she went to the wrong table) and then walked up to our table again to yell at my boyfriend \"why the hell did you take your friend's food? That was cod with friends and you ordered haddock with fries.\" At this point, I was really unimpressed and asked her to \"please lower her voice\". And she said in the most sarcastically way \"I have been working with a fan all day, do you think I know when I am yelling!?\" At that point, my friend was kind enough to jump in and said he didn't mind having my boyfriend's food, and that we just wanted to eat our dinner.

She goes back inside the kitchen, FINALLY brings out my sandwich and the haddock with fries. Dumps them on the table again with a bang, forgets our utensils, and said loudly \"YOU ARE WELCOME\". We went back in to get our own utensils, rubbing shoulders with her, but she ignores us. 

For the rest of the night, she tried to instigate again by coming up to our table and faking a smile and asking \"how is your food?\" and leaving before we could say a thing. 

Needless to say, we left Market Street Catch with the biggest disappointment. Being a St Lawrence Market, it's really sad to see one server ruining our experience at a decent dinner spot. My hope is that management sees this message and works on customer service training with this particular server."}
{"text":"3.5 for me. Fresh seafood but a bit pricey for what it's worth. Overall good food but loses on the other factors that make a good restaurant. Market Street Catch is just located outside the St. Lawrence Market. The restaurant itself sort of felt like an in between of a restaurant and a fast food joint. You order up at the cashier and grab a seat and a server will bring you your food. 

There are a variety of choices ranging from regularly fish and chips to calamari and more unique items like the lobster poutine (which I found fantastic!) Seafood was fresh and portion sizes were acceptable. However the pricing for me just didn't cut it for what I was getting. It felt too much like a cheap seafood joint to be charging those prices. If the restaurant improved on overall packaging (service, renovations, plating etc...) I'd probably bump this rating to a 4."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place for a while. I love seafood, so this place was a must to try. Came here on a hot Saturday afternoon after walking through St. Lawrence Market. As I really wanted to eat seafood at the time, I remember this place was conveniently located right across. This place looks really nice inside, with a very casual presence. As I am a big fan of fish and chips, I decided to order it, while my friend ordered the lobster sandwich. Although, the Fish and Chips were decent, I've had countless places where it was more crispy and flavorsome. It was more or less very underwhelming. 

Overall it was nice trying this restaurant, If i come back I will for sure try other stuff off of the menu."}
{"text":"Nice, relatively cheap and cheerful place that matches the menu for Buster's (same owners) inside the market with a few additions.  I enjoyed my fish tacos a lot.  Three tasty tacos, one each of halibut, ahi tuna (fab!) and shrimp.  The lobster poutine is pricey and they don't use the nicer thin fries that Buster's does.  If they did, it could be a winner.  Not yet.  The Halibut and salad was good, a very fresh garden salad and the halibut not overly battered, but the pieces were smaller than I'd have liked.  Overall worth trying when the market is closed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and it was great - had the oyster PO boy and it was big - but not as big as the calamari sandwich special - that was huge. Fresh seafood, fair not low prices and super friendly staff. Salads looked great, coleslaw was more than enough of a side.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and each time it just seems to get better. Never disappointed!!! We took our parents from out of town and they were thoroughly impressed. Service - amazing, Seafood - fresh, and the beer - cold. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch on a Monday after being disappointed that St. Lawrence market was closed on Monday's (I should've checked it out beforehand :( ), but so many options! A smidge on the pricey side for a lunch but I'd say it was almost worth it. 

The restaurant itself is nice with a small outdoor seating area, lots of seats facing the kitchen so you can see your dishes as they're being prepared and the whole place is well lit. There are hot sauces along almost all the tables too for that extra kick for your dishes. 

Ordered the 3 Tacos (Tuna, Halibut & Shrimp) and my gf had one of their specials on a hand-written menu board (\"Shrimp pimp\" I think was its name. Our lunch ended up being about $35 (after adding a bottle of Orangina - yum) together and the portions of the dishes we ordered were much bigger than what we had anticipated.

The tacos - although tiny looking - were loaded with pico de gallo and their respective seafood and were probably THE best seafood tacos I've had in the city. The Halibut was probably my favourite as it was so soft and flavourful... my mouth is watering just thinking about it! The only gripe I had was that sometimes the fish was a smidge too big for the tiny tacos and it could've made for some messy situations. Maybe cutting it up into slightly smaller pieces would help? The Shrimp Pimp dish was pretty much an 8-inch sub of seafood awesomeness and was served with coleslaw and side salad (the salad was an extra $3, but depending on how hungry you are, pretty sure the sandwich+slaw will do the job).

Would love to come back to try the lobster poutine and other seafood items in the future for sure though!"}
{"text":"I'm baffled by the very negative reviews for this place. I live right across the street, and it has become one of my consistently great and fast dinner restaurants. 

It looks like most of the negative reviews are for the fish and chips. Maybe those need some improvement - I have had them once or twice and liked them, but I'm not an expert. 

But the sandwiches are always outstanding - whether its grilled fish or fried shrimp/oysters. The fries are great and so is the salad. 

The prices are perhaps $2-3 dollars more than you would hope. The food isn't cheap, but it's not overpriced either. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered through Ritual.

Read some of the feedback in regards to the tacos so got those. 
Ordered 3 tacos, asked them to be spicy, they were fried Shrimp, seated Tuna and fried Halibut.

Taste: all 3 were delicious but my favourite was the fried halibut hands down. And the spice level was perfect!

Presentation: great! They were loaded and served with 3 lime wedges

Price: fair! I got a deal through ritual but the average cost of 4.50-5.00 a taco is good.

Portion: good. I don't know what this one review was talking about it not being enough for lunch for one person, I am stuffed!


Overall : great and will definitely return! I want to  heck out other tasty things on their menu."}
{"text":"Had trout on salad here today. Was quite tasty and healthy but not worth $18 for a takeout lunch. Perhaps the fish and chips is better value..."}
{"text":"Nice alternative for Buster's when the market is either closed or too busy. I get the impression that they share the same ownership or at least supplier. I see a lot of reviewers are swayed by the price, but quality seafood often calls for a higher cost. Anyway, you won't be disappointed by anything you order."}
{"text":"If you're into fish and are in Lawrence Market neighbourhood, this is the place to go. Great atmosphere. Outdoor seating. Fresh seafood. Swordfish is really good, and the lobster roll as well."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for Fresh Sea food this place is it! We ordered the grilled red snapper sandwich with cold slaw and coconut shrimps with fries. The portions were large and freshly prepared for us. The bill after tax was about $28 bucks!! Will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Love it! Was checking out St. Lawrence market around lunchtime and stopped in here for grilled sardines salad. The sardines were fresh and had a lovely smoky flavor from the grill and the salad was fresh with an appropriate amount of delicious dressing. If I ever visit Toronto again I'd totally return!"}
{"text":"**3.5** 
So I love that you can watch them make your food and you can also see all the options of items in front of you and the freshness.
I ordered a shrimp po boy and my niece ordered halibut and fries.
so it is kind of pricey but everything is fresh so I understand. 
I however didn't enjoy my fries. They're string fries and were soft and soggy not fresh at all. Which you have to pay extra for so kind of annoying.
My niece absolutely loved her fish. It wasn't all crispy like those greasy back alley fish and chips places. it was authentic nice thick cut pieces lightly breaded.
The po boy way very good as well, I just didn't like the pickles and thought it was a bit more dill than I would have preferred. The dill and pickle  flavour kind of over power the whole sandwich.
I think I'll be back to try something new as I work up the street."}
{"text":"I had a really great meal here. 3 taco combo - Shrimp, Tuna, and Halibut. The tacos were delicious. Really, really good. For seafood lovers, this is a nice, casual place to check out. The prices are good and the service is friendly. I'll be coming back to this place more often."}
{"text":"Love this place... A good alternative to Buster Sea Cove and a great patio!  The seafood platter is worth sharing.  Love that you can sit in the sun with a beer and delicious grilled calamari.  

The staff are friendly and helpful.  Would definitely go back to try the lobster bisque! Hmmm yum!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on our recent visit Toronto. We got the seafood platters. I got grilled, he got fried both with salad. Some of the best sea food I've had! Very fresh and flavorful, the fried fish was not greasy whatsoever. Octopus was melt in your mouth tender and the swordfish was to delicious. The sweet chili and white yogurt tasting sauce were a great pairing.  

The grilled platter I got only had one prawn, one small octopus tentacle and a small piece of award fish but a good amount of calamari and salad. Just wish I had been give more. 
I definitely recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. I was looking forward to the opening of this restaurant, hoping there would be a good neighbourhood place for a casual meal. I went this afternoon for lunch and ordered fish and chips. The halibut was dry. The batter was heavy and the fries were cooked from frozen. I won't go back."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.

Sort of like a cafeteria.  Came into the restaurant and the two girls behind the counter where having fun chatting with each other and didn't even acknowledge our arrival.

I had to interrupt them to get attention and to order.

You have to pay before you get your food and leave a tip before you are served. Needless to say what a stupid concept that is.  If you want coffee or desert after you have to go back to the counter and reorder and get another bill. Obviously we passed on that idea.

I ordered the seafood linguini.  It had scallops and mussels in a tomato sauce. The mussels were tiny and hardly visible.  The scallops were the small ones and were overcooked and had the consistency of a rubber ball. The pasta was dry.

My wife ordered the halibut fillet and she felt it was overcooked and stringy.

Kids running this operation in a disinterested fashion.

Will not return --- too bad."}
{"text":"For dinner we made our way down to St.Lawrence Market to check Buster's new restaurant on Market Street, called Market Street Catch. The place is located on the east side of Market Street facing St.Lawrence Market. The entire street has been under development for some time, adding charm with cobblestones and making it more attractive to pedestrian rather than car traffic. There are a collection of restaurants as the street slopes south to the Esplanade. 

There is a small outdoor patio and and windows that in better weather will be able to open giving the place the feel of a cafe. Inside a few tables sit by the windows with a long bar for single seats along one wall. Facing this on the other wall is the open kitchen and all the fish displayed behind glass. The setting is minimalist using greyed barn boards, white subway tiles and black chalkboards to suggest a traditional fish-mongers store. The simplicity of the setting was matched by a nice selection of fish and seafood. Fish can be grilled, fried or served as sandwiches and with either fries or salad. The place is set up for take-out, you place your order at the cash and either eat in or take out."}
{"text":"This place has attitude in food and in service. The food is so tiny portion for the price you are paying, and the staffs love to talk back at you and it's really not pleasant. (At least not the way I would like to spend my Saturday weekend brunch with my family) Yeah... They think they are right all the time. 
Me? Not going back. I mean these days, food service in Toronto is really good and superb. I don't know why I should pay for food that's not enough (we had to grab something else again because we were hungry less than 2hrs we ate there) and for service that is so rude. I mean, given they hired high school kids/college students.... Yes.... You will get the teenager attitude from them and I don't need that in my life."}
{"text":"This place is lovely to be at! It is probably a sister restaurant of Buster's Sea Cove as the menu items are closely similar but offers alcohol and a bit more class. The prices are on par to the BSC and it has seating which is a win! They have cheaper lunch options that are usually paired with salad or fries. I am in love with their more expensive options like the lobster rigatoni or the seafood linguine which is like heaven in your mouth! Both are packed with a ridiculous amount of seafood and for the price around $20 after tax and tip makes it was a perfect combination of quality food! Honesty, this place is packed so I usually order on ritual and sometimes just head home to enjoy the meal! They nicely seal the meal with glad wrap so it will not leak! 

If you like seafood, this place should be on the top of your list to try! Though it's a shame they dont do any clam ahucklin"}
{"text":"I ordered the Grilled Tilapia Sandwich while my friend ordered the Tacos.  

I found that the price is on the high side, especially for lunch.  My friend paid 20 dollars for his tacos and a drink.  Which was no bigger than an appetizer at milestones.   One things for sure.  He didnt leave full.   He did say it tasted really good.

My grilled Tilapia sandwich which was about 12 dollars tasted great.  

if price is not a factor, its worth a shot.  Its not outrageous prices.. just on the high side."}
{"text":"My brother and I each had a sandwich (grilled swordfish and grilled red snapper.) The fish was great, tasted really fresh and well made, but each sandwich had only the thinnest fillet (was definitely expecting a more healthy portion and was disappointed with the minimalist cut.)"}
{"text":"Please be aware that this review is based off of an UberEATS delivery. It took about 35 minutes to arrive from the time I placed the order 

We ordered two mussles and clams in red wine and tomato sauce one spicy and one mild. The food was absolutely delicious and soupy just how I like my muscles. The toasted bread was perfect for the amount of broth and the mussles were cooked perfectly. 

My only piece of criticism would be the take out packaging. The containers were thin plastic wrapped in Saran so as to not spill, however one of the containers leaked and the plastic bag it was in had a large amount of liquid in it. Not sure if this was the poor transportation of the uber driver or poor packaging from the restaurant.  Considering that mussles are a broth dish they should think about getting containers more suited to that. 

Otherwise, a great experience!"}
{"text":"Great fish tacos - failry well priced and overall quite light. Great place for a work lunch (although come early they don't do reservations)"}
{"text":"Love this place!  If you're a seafood lover, you must check it out.

It's a great alternative to Busters Sea Cove (which has long line-ups and way less seating) inside the market.  If you want a better chance of a seat - and a place with just as great food - come here instead!

ATMOSPHERE:  Great vibe.  Modern, hipster, take-out joint. With sit-down tables and counter seating too.  You do order over-the-counter. So no table service, aside from food being brought to you once cooked.

SERVICE:  Fast. Which is great because they're always busy so there often is a line. BUT I think they service the queue at impressive speed, considering the traffic in there.  A little wait is totally worth it!

PRICE:  Affordable. A good range from smaller bites (tacos, soup, salads) to bigger meals (sandwiches, mixed platters).

FOOD:  Fresh and delicious!  Have been here multiple times now, and it's always tasty and consistently so.  Have introduced many friends here, since my first visit.  We haven't had anything we didn't like. From mixed grilled seafood platter (My favourite! Because how can you just choose one thing?...), to tacos, to soup - we just keep coming back for more.

TIP: Look for their daily specials on a small blackboard behind the cash (the last time I was there - it was on top of a fridge) - it's easy to miss! But if you're looking for something different than they're usual offerings, check those options first."}
{"text":"The layout is really nice and the serving is pretty decent. A bit pricey though. I will return."}
{"text":"While the food here was alright. The service was mostly garbage. We ordered 2 simple items off the menu: a sandwich and fish & chips. 

We were brought completely wrong orders. We initially chalked it up to an honest mistake by the server and we kindly explained that wasn't what we ordered and would like the correct food. They sent an additional 2 servers out to us to try and explain what WE had done wrong, that we should be more careful and correct next time, and that they'd fix this mistake WE made \"this one time.\"

This is no way to treat first time customers. We're not idiots, we know what we asked for. In the end, they walked up to us again to explain, \"oh we figured out what happened, the new employee brought you guys the wrong table order, whoops.\" Barely an apology let alone taking ownership. 

Good food is only one aspect. Service goes the extra mile. I won't be ordering or coming back. Cheers."}
{"text":"What a great place that my friend brought to me to. The chowder, lobster grilled cheese, and coconut shrimp were delicious. The grilled cheese was full of lobster and not just a couple of pieces. The same with the chowder, full of seafood and not just a ton of soup. There was no more smoked salmon and the girl working the cash suggested the coconut shrimp. It was sweet with just the right amount of crunch. The fries were so good that my friend and I completely devoured them."}
{"text":"Great Place!

Really enjoyed the Fish Tacos!!! 
Highly recommended! 

will definatley visit again"}
