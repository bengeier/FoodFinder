{"text":"Terrible. Don't waste your money.   The woman behind the counter simply dished a giant ladle of pasta sauce onto fusili. No sautéing, no accounting for how much should be on there. 5 seconds later I had my pasta.   It was like a hot soup with pasta floating in it. Watery soup.   Needless to say I will not be back."}
{"text":"Dropped in tonight to try it after having heard of it - we bought 2 jars of sauce, penne alla vodka and Alfredo.  The penne alla vodka was delicious, perfect amount of bacon.  The Alfredo was creamy ... Couldn't get enough of it...  We're both happy we took a large jar, this will be the perfect lunch on monday.  Can't wait to try their mushroom sauce!  I also noticed an assortment of specialty olive oils, great little spot!"}
{"text":"THE BEST caesar salad dressing I've ever ever had. Homemade, no egg or dairy. Unreal good. The sauce .... omg I CRAVE it some times, and I'm not even a huge pasta eater since I try to stay away from heavy foods most of the time. This is soooo worth it!!! The Caprese salad is amazing too!!"}
{"text":"yuck! I tried this because well, it's new in the neighborhood and it looks interesting.  1. the staff was not very friendly- if you are a fairly new business, you might want to try being a little more engaging.  2. the food is gross- you get your pasta in a little paper box thing that you picture new york chinese take out to be in. basically, pasta is filled and then they pour the sauce of your choice on top. So.... the top of salty and saucey and the bottom is bland unsauced pasta.   I don't get this. And I don't like it."}
{"text":"The sauce is delicious! Especially the vodka sause (some sort of rosé with bacon)!   The issue I have is with the noodles. I've tried all three shapes hoping that I would like one of them. The fucili is too thick and overpowers the sauce. The penne is the best of the three but it's very chewy, and the spaghetti is also chewy and the texture just isn't right. It sticks to your teeth kind of like the texture of licorish and it tastes like your eating doe. I find that all of the noodles taste undercooked.   If you want tasty pasta for lunch go to Fusaros."}
{"text":"Was feeling peckish and in this Liberty mall enclave on an early evening, in the hours just after work when the place starts to feel like a ghost town. The idea of a veg Hero Burger did not appeal but I wanted something quick and satisfying.  Drawn in by the signs out front I found Pastalicious empty except for myself and two staff behind the counter. I ordered a simple fusilli and tomato sauce, paid and took a seat. The pasta was prepared quickly, about 4mins but tasted fresh. I liked the thickly wound fusilli they used. What stood out especially was the tomato sauce. I was surprised at how flavorful it was. I actually regretted not buying a jar to take home later. A good simple tomato sauce at a take-out place like this is a pretty rare thing.  The pasta was served in a Chinese take-out container, the paper kind you see on Seinfeld but never get with Chinese food in this city. It kept the sauce in surprisingly well however, I felt like it was a huge waste since I ate in at their window bar and through it out immediately after. If they had some ceramic bowls and silverware for in-house dinners it reduce waste.  All-in-all, definitely worth checking out if you if you're looking for a quick, simple and delicious meal."}
{"text":"I work in the Liberty Village neighborhood and eat at pastalicous pretty much every day. I have tried everything off the menu all sauces, pastas and salads and I am very satisfied each time I go there. My favourite pasta is the Penne alla Vodka but recently started to favourite the Penne alfredo needless to say all sauces are delicious. I also like all of the salads which are always fresh and they offer homemade dressings which are also delicious. The staff is extremely friendly and make it very helpful figuring out what to have each time. I give this place 5 stars."}
