{"text":"I like the food and their great customer service. Prices are affordable for daily buffet, just  $9.99 for variety of items. Great I will definately will go 2 times a week for my lunch."}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful.  Very authentic Indian and Nepalese food.  They have a wide variety of items.  Their prices are extremely reasonable and portions are good (actually loaded with meat). I've been to their all-you-can-eat lunch buffet (cheap at $9.99 a person) and for dinner.  Both times I've been very pleased with the food and the service.  Loved their tandoori chicken, butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, and curry goat!  The naan is great too!  The owner stopped by our table to make sure that everything was to our satisfaction (very friendly and pleasant) and our server was very friendly and attentive.  It's better Indian food than a lot of the other Indian places around here, in Richmond Hill, and a much better value too (you get a lot for your money and it's much cheaper than the competition).  The restaurant, itself, is charming and clean; I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Went on a team lunch with ~ 14 people from the team. We tried the buffet and everyone pretty much enjoyed all the food - especially the $10+tax price tag. There isn't as much selection in the buffet here compared to some others in the area, but given the price that's kind of expected. All the tables are for groups of 4 so for bigger groups you'll have to split up or re-org the tables (and at max you can still only seem to combine 2 tables). The Naan was tasty, there's an even split of veggie and non-veggie options (like 4 of each), with a couple of sweet dishes. I'd like to give this place a 4.5 - I don't think it quite meets the \"5 star\" standard (in particular for me, it was missing both my favorite veggie dishes - malai kofta and shahi paneer) but its still really good.

The place is also very clean, according to one of the tips below they just recently renovated and renamed to \"Punjab Kitchen & Bar\" in case your favorite navigation app (or calling in and hearing the wrong name) confuses you."}
{"text":"The details of this place are a bit confusing. I was there last Tuesday, so let me just clear up a few things:

First of all, the store is not called \"Bombay BBQ Hut.\" I think it says \"Punjab\" in front of the door now...I'm sorry but I forget the name -- it's certainly not Bombay BBQ hut as we drove in circles for a few minutes before calling the place and getting told it was different entirely.

The guy who answered the phone was struggling with English, but was polite enough although a bit low energy. He was also our server...he wasn't rude just...I don't know...kind of depressed or something. Service was just fine.

It's a small little place with lots of seats. Reservations are not needed. We went for the lunch buffet which was $12 + tax + tip, not $9.99 like the sign in this thread suggests...so something changed.

They did not have a huge selection. No vinadloo! But, everything I ate was very tasty and filling. They brought fresh nan to the table and more when we asked without charge. All in all, it was a great meal and afterwards I just needed to fall asleep. 

I would have no problems coming back here again. It's not the best Indian buffet I've ever been to (that one goes to a place in Hamilton), and I am by no means an expert in Indian food, but this place was just great. 

4 stars because the buffet was quite small, but everything was just fine. I'm not a big fan of pakora...(I find it's usually too salty in buffets) but their pakora was fantastic. And they cooked chick peas better than I've ever had...they just popped in your mouth. The butter chicken had giant whole pieces of chicken, too. Nan was super fantastic....BUT EVERYTHING WAS SO FILLING.

I would certainly return again for a quick meal...but I think I may plan to fall asleep in the car afterwards, and before I drive home, because it sure was filling the only thing missing was a nice nap. 

Almost forgot one negative...they were playing some music but it was rather loud. That was a bit annoying but I think they turned it down a little bit (still loud) when we came in so that was nice. 

Also, the server asked if things were 'too spicy' (probably because we are white...I get that a lot) but if anything it was quite under spiced for Indian food."}
{"text":"This is my fourth visit! If you're craving delicious authentic Indian and Nepalese cuisine, look no further. Tucked away amongst several Asian inspired Restos, this place satisfies my tastes buds!
They offer a limited time offer of 2 can buffet dine for $9.99 ( which my sister and I will be back before the end of the month!! 
Tastefully decorated and clean...they offer take out and dine in. 
I'm back for my usual Saag Paneer, rice and Naan....sooooo delicious!!!
Menu has a very wide variety of dishes, very reasonably priced. 
Wonderful & friendly service. 
Don't miss out on this Richmond Hill hideaway!"}
{"text":"Looking at the few number reviews here made me a bit nervous going to try this new restaurant.  But at 9.99 for lunch buffet, it was certainly worth a try. Going in on the second Monday of June, I was completely satisfied with my meal. 

The decor is clean, modern, yet comfortable. There are white table cloths on the table and the silverware is sparkling. The service was also very attentive and kind. Every time my glass was less than full, it was topped up promptly. The waitress had a smile on he face and genuinely seemed like she enjoyed serving us.

The selection is a touch smaller than India's Taste, but each item is done very well.  It is certainly now in the top three India buffets I have been in Toronto, and I have been to most all of them. 

Firstly, there is your typical salad selections, with a spread of various India pickles, chutneys, dips, and raita. Along with good steamed basmati rice, and papadums, these formed the basics in which most other buffets are the same.

The butter chicken is made with care, and very fragrant, not too spicy and has the aroma of cream and butter.  Absolutely divine.

Goat curry was extremely tender. Did not fight with it at all. Even my toothless grandmother could chew it with ease.  The flavour was warm, inviting, and satisfying.  A good pair with rice and naan.

There were three different veggie curry selections this day: eggplant, okra, and mixed veggies. All three were unique and flavourful.  I especially liked the mixed veggies.  Seeing as this is a Nepalese and India restaurant (the owners are obviously Nepalese) the spicing is done a little differently than I am used to, but I am enjoying it a lot more.

Samosa are probably the best I have had in Toronto.  Beats out all others I have had.  The pastry is just thick enough, crisp on the outside yet tender. The filling is spiced potatoes, but cut into very small cubes, much smaller than usual.  This made the filling creamy feeling, yet toothsome. A pleasant divergence from the typical gummy mash that others serve.

There is actually chicken biryani on the buffet, and I can attest it is better than most others that say they specialize in biryani. The fried noodles are also very good, utilizing their tandoori chicken as the protein.  It has a slightly smoky flavour in the background; what we Cantonese would call the 'qi of the wok'. I couldn't get enough of it.

The naan was equally impressive. Soft and tender on the inside, with a crisp and smoky crust. You can tell it was freshly made.  Better yet, it was brush with real ghee/butter! Most place use vegetable ghee (I can tell), but this place had naan with the distinct fragrance that only real ghee can give.  Kudos to them.

As a plus, they had shrimp on the buffet. Sauteed in butter and spices, they were done very well.  I am slightly allergic to shrimp, but I risked it anyway, to get a few pieces in.

Dessert was limited, but included my favourites: gulab jamun and kheer.  There was also fresh fruit (watermelon was in season and very sweet) and mango puree with fruits.

Looking at their take-out menu, they even make momos.  I wish they had those on the buffet. As well, as some of their Nepalese specials.  Would make the experience even better.

A stone's throw away from The Host, this place is definitely the superior competitor.  Come and try for yourself.  I can see myself being a regular at this point."}
{"text":"Bombay Bhel. Taste Of India. The host. 

So many choices for AYCE buffet in Markham. However, the adventurer in me could not  resist conquering a new place. I also gathered up the troops at work. 5 men prepared to get dirty by digging our fingernails and shredding warm naan and dipping it into butter chicken sauce while vigorously trying to hold on to the tender chicken while lifting it to our mouths; repeatedly until every last inch of our stomach was full  . We wore large sweaters to mask the bloating we are guaranteed to encounter ; we were prepared for war against this Indian food who are world renowned to kick your ass the next day- bring on your attack we said!

WOMP WOMP WOMP

we arrive in this little plaza and did a full drive around to find Bombay BBQ hut; but to no Avail. Instead we found Punjab Kitchen + Bar. Walked in; and immediately I knew I let my troops down. Very little selection; the butter chicken had bone in it and marketing wise it was horrible. Seemed like they took the Tandoori chicken which is placed right above it and throw it in the butter chicken sauce. 

The naan was the highlight of the day- and excuse my accent but the desserts were \"rubbish\"

I would not recommend this anyone. I hate saying this about food but- BAD!"}
{"text":"So the first rule of business says that keep your brand name intact and make sure ppl can relate to you by your business name 
But I believe that's what went wrong here, They take over previous mgmt but didn't update Yelp business name
The new owner is under Punjab and I happen to be there as we were looking for Indian food in this area
Buffett was good, Food was delicious but server was very reactive and had worse reactions for any questions / feedback

I might try again if I happen to be around but not a must place to go"}
{"text":"It's closed!  But it's reopening!

The new name will be Punjabi. I'll keep you posted...."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  Everything was delicious!  The staff was friendly and made sure we were well taken care of.  Loved every item they had there especially the warm, fresh naan.  I will definitely be coming back.  It totally beats down The Host that's down the street from it."}
{"text":"This place is very good.. Compared to Host which is nearby the food is better and even cheaper.. Moreover service is much better than host.. Portions are very good and would strongly recommend this restaurant.. Try their lunch buffet too.. It's a deal.."}
{"text":"This authentic Indian Nepalese restaurant offers an option for a la carte or buffet. Their dinner menu specifically offers an excellent variety of Indian cuisine, Manxhurian dishes and Nepalese cusine. My favourite personally was the one-of-a-kind tandoori chicken and the best saag paneer I've tried. Thumbs-up."}
{"text":"We went here for Sunday lunch. Unfortunately, they didn't have the buffet menu available and only had the a-la carte; which was fine with me. We've never had Nepalese before and tried the Chili Chicken and the hot & sour soup from the Nepalese menu side.

The Chili Chicken was definitely different and better than what you've had gotten in a Hakka restaurant. As well, the hot & sour soup was also not your regular hot & sour, the aesthetics and taste was better!

We also ordered from the Indian side of the menu, I'd recommend the Lamb Curry for sure.

Overall, I'd be back as the owners were pretty friendly. It's a mom & pop restaurant and the food was made fresh to order."}
