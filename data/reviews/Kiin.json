{"text":"4.5. My review is based on their soft-opening menu -- can't wait to see what their full menu will look like!! Royal Thai cuisine, which is definitely not easy to find in Toronto.   Roy Thai -- 4 dumplings, so delicious. Hard to choose which was my favourite. 5/5  Khao Yum -- Yum!!! So beautiful. Jasmine rice dyed naturally + lots of herbs and flowers. Tastes royal, and would definitely have again. 5  The sea bream -- I loved the little wraps that they came with. Again, flavourful herbs. I liked the seam bream as well, but I think it slightly lacked flavour. The \"stuffing\" it comes with is quite good, though."}
{"text":"When you step foot into the restaurant, you are greeted by friendly and accommodating staff and a relaxed atmosphere.  At around 7pm on a Monday evening, the restaurant was filled with the sound of polite dinner conversations.  My friends and I were seated at the bar which provided full service.  We did not have a prior reservation, so this was very accommodating of the staff for prime dinner time.  Then menu options provided a limited choice of snacks, some small dishes, some large dishes, and dessert.  We chose to share root vegetable chips with Tom Yum spices as snack, the Royal Thai spread for small dishes, and the chicken and the beef Wellington for larger dishes.  Overall, the dishes were presented well and the food was delicious.  However, the portion sizes were small for the price.  The chips had sharp impressive flavours and the sauce for the chicken dish went well with the sticky rice.  The beef Wellington was very tender.   The Royal Thai spread provided four bite-sized tastes of Thai cuisine. We also ordered the Thai Pandan iced tea, which was refreshing and washed everything down well.  The staff at the bar provided us with timely service and helpful recommendations for our dishes."}
{"text":"Came for a girls night out and to try out this new Thai restaurant in downtown Toronto.  Food  Root vegetable chips - $9 shareable.  Crispy and flavourful!   Dumplings - $12 for 2 veggie and 2 meat.  This is probably the more favourable dish of the night as the different dumplings had unique flavours and the design was done with finesse.  Sea salt-crusted sea bream - $32 shareable.  You get the entire fish but it's not deboned so be aware of tiny bones! The pepper and salt gives the fish dish a nice kick but overall flavour was very plain as the fish and lettuce was not flavoured.  Pork jowl - shareable. Juicy and well cooked! One of the favourable dish of the night as well. Asian flavoured and plenty to share with friends.   Service Can a bit slow when it gets busy as our server was hard to get a hold of when we needed water refills or getting the bill.   Ambience Really nice interior design. Can be loud during busier time and makes it a little harder to converse over the noise.  Kiin isn't your typical \"go to\" for Thai food as it serves more upscale \"fancy\" Thai food. You won't get your pad Thai or Thai curry craving served here."}
{"text":"Kiin - Toronto is a foody town - my argument with that is that it can be overwhelming to find something that stands out. BUT YOU...hahah! You created a lovely evening for us last night. It's like you know us or something - the music - yes it does make a difference - the table (those chairs were totally our aesthetic and you located us with a view of the action while coze-ied from it  ), the food (extraordinary) and the service (perfectly timed and neither effusive nor aloof). AND every single person that touched us from the moment we walked in the door wished us a \"Happy Anniversary\" - plus the sparkling wine with edible flowers arriving at our table when we sat down as a further gesture of your kindness - well done!  We are now HUGE fans and will be bringing rounds of our foody friends to experience your wonders.  Thanks again,  Wendy"}
{"text":"We went on the 2nd night of the  soft opening. Tldr: this unique Royal Thai cuisine experience makes me want to go to Thailand for real.   Starting from my drink, to the apps, then mains and lastly dessert, everything was special, beautiful, delicious and memorable. I did not want to finish my last bite.   My faves: Pandan Thai iced tea - slightly sweetened, nice Pandan taste, fun colour visual. Great fun way to start the meal. Khao Yum - rice in 3 colours with various herbs and tamarind soy sauce. I've never seen anything like it! I liked it the taste more with lime. Braised beef short rib - so tender, and the gravy/curry-like sauce is something I could eat on its own with just rice. Roy Thai - platter of 4 different style dumplings. Incredibly creative, nice play on visual and flavour. I had to share each bite but you won't want to share... Fruit platter dessert - these fruits are imported from Thailand. Never have I tasted such ripe fruits from Thailand. The mango!! Ripe for 2 months of the year! It melts in your mouth!! This is like the Kobe beef of fruits!! Mangosteen - first time trying it. I'm definitely going to buy these at the grocery store now! I'm hooked! Pomelo and rambutan - ok, these were not as mind blowing as the first two fruits. We were pretty full after the mains but after tasting the fruits, we would have been able to keep going...  Can't wait to see their expanded and perfectly crafted menu in the future! Definitely coming back. Awesome job Kiin team, Chef Nuit and Jeff!"}
{"text":"Service was very attentive as the waiters and waitresses always made sure we had enough water. The decor was aesthetically pleasing. The reason for the lower rating was because of the food. For the food, I was expecting something a little more above and beyond given the hype and the prices. The flavours are definitely different from other Thai restaurants like Pai."}
{"text":"Wow, no old Pad Tai here. Beautiful delish items here! Made with care and served expertly! Comming back here again!"}
{"text":"Cool dining experience, nice decor and good tasting food. However, it was expensive with small portions. Wouldn't go back again, but it was worth a visit"}
{"text":"The decoration was so pretty and elegant. The food was well-prepared, creative and very delicious. Totally different experience from going to any Thai restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"My partner and I are from Australia and are staying a minute away from Kiin. We were lucky enough to be squeezed in and provided with a table for dinner and we are so glad we made the spontaneous decision to try here! It was AMAZING. We ordered the braised beef short rib (our personal favourite), braised chicken stir fry, coconut rice and roti.   The beef literally fell off of the bone and the sauce we were scooping up with our spoons. The chicken was full of flavour and the coconut rice and roti were the perfect accompaniment.   We would definitely recommend this Thai restaurant to not only Toronto locals but also travelers from abroad."}
{"text":"I was here last night for a 5:45 pm reservation with a friend. Atmosphere is trendy, our server was attentive (although somehow our appetizer came out after our main which she apologized for), food is tasty and presented very well however they are comparable to the dishes served at PAI but at a higher price point that I don't really think can be justified.   The restaurant filled up quickly after our arrival and we ordered drinks, an appetizer, a small plate and a main for sharing. At 7:15 pm the manager came over and asked us to leave because they needed the table for walk-ins... ARE YOU SERIOUS? I have never in my life been asked to leave a table at a restaurant I have dined at.    I informed her that it was very RUDE to rush a table out that had actually taken the time to make a reservation over a week in advance. She informed me that she thought the hostess had mentioned that they needed the table back at 7 pm when we were seated, she did not. Won't be coming back here simply because the lack of tact displayed by the Manager. It was embarrassing for both me and my friend to be asked to leave in front of other tables still dining. I'll be taking my business elsewhere since this is clearly a faux fine dining experience."}
{"text":"4 starts for the way dishes are presented, good for taking pictures. The food taste similar to other good Thai restaurants, no positive surprise. A bit pricy if you also order drinks and desert, we ended up paying over $110 for two. Good services, will recommend to try it if you haven't been there before, but is one of those places won't worth going again I'd say."}
{"text":"Nuit does it again! We visited Kiin on the 2nd day of their soft launch. Jeff and Nuit were kind enough to stop by some tables to say hello. We heard about the lengths they took to get the most unique and rarest of ingredients for their dishes. Their stories made the food experience that much better, knowing that they put so much thought and effort into creating these delicious dishes with such complex and distinct flavours.   Onto the food! We ordered: - Khao Tung Nah Tang - Roy Thai - Kang Moo Yang Nam Jim - Khao Yum - Gaeng Boombai  All the dishes we ordered were presented beautifully and were all delicious! Meant to be family style with shareable dishes, this restaurant is a different dining experience compared to Pai/Sukho Thai/sabai sabai and was a bit fancier/pricier. It was worth the money though and a must-try if you enjoy Nuit's food."}
{"text":"this is probably already one of my favorite Thai restaurants I've ever been too in toronto. This says a lot as I've been to many. they are currently doing a soft opening and there wasn't a huge selection for lunch however it made it easier for me to make a decision about what I wanted to eat and I wasn't disappointed. The only way to describe their red curry : refreshing and rich. Paired perfectly with the jasmine rice and Pandan Thai Iced Tea. Would definitely come back. Great job !"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing service.  Beautiful and delicious food and a really great restaurant space.  We let the waiter order for us and everything was so delicate and well flavoured.    The root chips are a must! The pork jowl was a little tough but well flavoured.  They catered to our but allergy really well and prepared two different versions of the royal thai dumplings (the blue ones are insanely good).    We had the fancy rice salad (Khao yum) - beautiful but a little heavy.  If you like 37 ingredients in a dish the Lee slaw is better but this has more Instagramability.    The short rib and coconut rice is next level great.    Cocktails and alcohol are really expensive for what they are.  A negroni for $16!   Regardless- overall a great place giving some solid option downtown for a business dinner or a date that isn't stuffy and full of bankers."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 9/10 Food: 9/10 Atmosphere: 8.5/10 Service: 9/10  I refer to Kiin as \"fancy Thai food\" in the most loving way possible. You will not find pad thai, khao soi, or any of that kind of food here, but what you will discover are bold flavours, a lovely intimate interior and great service.  Our server did a great job at explaining everything and when each dish came, she would let us know what was in it so we really got a sense of what we were eating. It was later in the evening so she had the time to do so, but still, A+ for making sure we were informed!  I really enjoyed the food. Not only because it was unlike any kind of Thai food I've had before, but also because you could tell each dish was prepared with a lot of precision and care. All ingredients are taken into account to create a final product that is balanced in flavour and presented nicely on the plate.   THE BOTTOM LINE: absolutely recommend this \"fancy Thai food\" place - a repeat on my list."}
{"text":"Brought to you by the same creators of Pai, Kiin takes on a different approach to what you would expect from \"Thai\" cuisine.  The interior decor is designed for bloggers- everything is Instagramable (Even the air ducts are intricately designed).   We were lucky to score a table for 2 at 6:00PM on a Tuesday night because the lineup was insane by the time we left. Reservations are strongly recommended and available on their website.   Dinner items are meant for sharing - I ordered the pork Joel which was marinated in deliciousness, and the mussels, which was aromatic but lacked texture. The dipping sauce was amazing though!  For the large plate, we shared the sea bream, which they brought out covered with sea salt first for a picture. The fish is then deboned on the side and comes with lettuce wraps. Our server did a pretty good job deboning but I still swallowed a couple of bones.   Cocktails here all range from $12+ and it's definitely a great place to have afterwork drinks. I can't complain about the service either!   Note: They're open for lunch now - completely different menu (more bowl like options) - I'll have to try it out!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Our waitress was a bit impatient, we felt rushed. But the food was phenomenal. Would highly recommend the dumpling platter to start. Go from sweet to savoury as they recommend and experience a theatrical performance in your mouth. Also try the beef for mains and dont forget to order their roti with it."}
{"text":"Lunch menu is very limited, with your choice of either a build-your-own soup noodle or choose from about 3 rice or other noodle dishes.   I picked the Khao Moo Grob, which the menu described as crispy pork with jasmine rice and roasted pork gravy. It also came with a side of a dark vinegar sauce, which wasn't mentioned on the menu but wasn't unwelcome nonetheless.   But the pork? Dryest pork you could ever get. It was so dry it was difficult to chew and even harder to swallow (it literally clung on for dear life to the sides of my throat and I made a silent prayer not to accidentally choke-cough it out into my boss's face). Gulping down the matoom (quince iced tea) fared no better for me - it's probably purely personal preference, but I didn't enjoy the taste, which reminded me of freezer-burned ice.   On the other hand, I had a taste of one of the noodle soups and it was fine.   If you're still curious to try Kiin, I'd suggest going only if you're not in a rush - as Kiin is still in soft-opening mode, service is extremely slow (waited 30 mins for lunch). There are a lot of kinks at Kiin...here's hoping they work them out."}
{"text":"Great place for meeting friends. Very nice deco and definitely not your ordinary Thai place! Highly recommend the grilled fish, lettuce wraps and everything else. A recommendation: make a reservation. We went on an ordinary Thursday night and we waited for 1.5 hrs for a table of two, we ended up sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"The mere reason Kiin is deserving a 2 star and not a 1 star for my review is based on the actions of one server who went above and beyond.   Atmosphere: it was quaint and I was quite surprised by how cramped we were all seated. The decor was lovely but sometimes a little arm room is appreciated in the dining experience (bumped forearms a couple times with the person beside me who was not a part of my dining group). The arrangement for the tables are small so the larger a dish the more tetris you will have to play to ensure nothing falls off the table or spills on you.  Service: We started with one server and thankfully ended with another. Prior to my arrival at this establishment, I called to inquire about allergies and dietary restrictions. They promised that they would make adjustments and removals in accordance to my list of restrictions. Escatic as I was since I thought as being the brain child of Pai (which is amazing beyond belief!) I was in the clear. Well...wrong. My first server would look at me annoyed about my inquires and refused to explain what was composed in a dish. Furthermore, when I stated what I could not eat, she just rolled her eyes and I doubt informed the chicken. I reiterated that certain spices could not be used or at least to inform me. She didn't. Can you guess what happened? Well! My allergies flared up to the horror of my boyfriend and myself. I called her over and demanded to know what was in it and once she told me, I explicitly re-conveyed that she said there was nothing that would harm me on the plate. She hurridedly scurried off to leave me to my internal hell. Thankfully, a male server saw the face I was making (pain and nearly in tears because of it) and inquired what was wrong. I told him how the server did not disclose the nature of the food and I ate it unaware and was experiencing significant pain. The server took over our table immediately and catered to us immensely. He explained thoroughly every component of every dish and so I was able to eat a little of something. I unfortunately did not get his name but he was fantastic and improved my night.   Food: My boyfriend liked what he ate. I liked the gourd and coconut rice. Would I recommend anyone with any allergy or senstitivity or dietary restrictions to go for dinner even if you call to make sure they can accommodate you? NOPE. Go to Pai. They will take care of you."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great Thai restaurant, your search is over. Kiin took over the old Khao San Road location and renovated the place to make it look more contemporary / upscale. We ordered a few cocktails (highly recommend Gemini and 2 Sisters); tasted great but they were a bit pricey. For appetizers, we ordered the Royal Thai (dumplings). There are 4 different types x 2 for a total of 8. Every dumpling is a unique texture and flavour. This is a must try dish! For dinner we ordered the beef boombai with coconut rice and wow...talk about flavour! The short rib was falling off the bone and the coconut curry was so creamy. This cost roughly $36 but was worth the price. For dessert, we ordered the Thai dessert roti. Nothing special but was the perfect amount of sweet.   This place has a great vibe, friendly service and is a must try!  Food: 4.5/5 Service: 4.5/5 Ambiance: 4.5/5 Price: 4/5"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place. I came here with my husband on our anniversary. I tried their Pandan ice tea and it was soooo refreshing. We had the wing bean salad, pork jowl, and beef rib eye. As each dish comes out the server explains the dish in a short description and gave us suggestions on how to eat the dish. The wing bean salad is definitely not for everybody, but if you are ok with fish sauce, this is flavorful dish is for you. We never had wing bean before and now I want to buy some and try to cook it at home. The pork jowl in comparison was less flavorful ( we should have eaten this dish first in retrospect) but still a delight. The winner definitely the bone in beef rib, we had roti with it which made it even more amazing . Overall I loved this meal!"}
{"text":"The second visit was not pleasant. I ordered different food, it turned out that it was just ok. I ordered the fish and salad and another herbal drink. I don't like the herbal drink this time, my friend's is even worse. Guess only 1/3 of their herbal tea is good. I don't like the salad, the herb is too strong. The fish is ok.  The service is extremely bad. We were sitting at a table near the entrance. It's hard to get the waiters attention. Secondly i calculated the tips wrong, put the tip amount slightly less than 15%, then he just threw the receipt on the table. I didn't realize it until I saw the receipt when I'm home. Anyway I'm done wif this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a  good place with nicely plated dishes and good food quality. It doesn't offer the traditional Thai food dishes but has different take on them. Its once of the nicer Thai restaurants around right now.  Only cons are portion sizes and lineups."}
{"text":"I have a feeling this is one of the spots that dish out Instagram worthy food one after another.  I recall this spot being occupied by a hugely popular Thai restaurant in the past and when they closed shop to move nearby I was dreading another condo tower taking over this spot. Luckily that hasn't happened for now. The layout is similar if I recall though the interior is nice and bright. This visit was courtesy to a reservation snagged by a Yelp eating buddy (YEB) earlier. This was an early dinner as had a Yelp Elite Event to attend nearby (funny how all things fall into place). I showed up a little bit earlier and grabbed a spot. YEB had already some dishes in mind so I went through and the large dish of short rib caught my eye. We decided on ordering two Royal Thai platters(as per recommendation by the server), Stir fried angled gourd and short rib. I ordered a Sapporo for good measure. I also appreciated their beer list as it had a couple of other beers I enjoy on draught. YEB also added a pandan ice tea afterwards. Their cocktails look pretty so if you enjoy that sort of thing this place is worth a look.  The royal thai platter was stunning and we even got instructions to eat from right to left. After the Instagram heaven of a dish in a word hmm I didn't quite enjoy the first two offerings as they had a sweet finish. The first one could even pass on as take on healthy dessert (whatever that means) to a thick satay sauce on the second. The third offering fared better as it had a very familiar taste profile (thick noodles with chicken  Pad See Ew). The last one had a shrimp though was forgettable. Again very pretty to look at and is sure to wow the table.  Next was stir fried gourd. Hmm nothing to write home about IMO. Beef Rib was good with nice tender meat cooked through perfectly. Not overwhelmed with sauce and nice thick lingering taste.  We also added the fruit platter for good measure. Again Instagram heaven here and thankfully tastes to match. I don't enjoy the non local fruit in North America period! so was delighted to taste fruit the way it should taste or at least the taste profile I associate with good fruit. We are talking  good lychee, decent pamelo, rambutan, Mangostean and dragon fruit which according to YDB were good (I have tried the last three before but don't know how to gauge a good fruit)  Hmm a difficult rating for moi as one associates consistent mainstream dishes in various Thai restaurants that are peppered throughout the city. This is by no means mainstream food. With the high price point it is at I feel there is a high expectation here as well. I will be back to try other items if I can but for now 3 stars.  P.S. Overzealous staff which can be a good or a bad thing depending on how you perceive this approach."}
{"text":"I was drawn to this place because of the beautiful pictures of the dumpling dishes. This place is cute, beautifully decorated and the food is played impeccably. It's a modern, refined take on Thai food. It may not have your more well known and popular dishes but it's a refreshing change And a place I'd go if you're feeling fancy.    We didn't make reservations and got to sit right at the counter by the kitchen, which was so cool! We got to see all the action and food being made. The service was great, the menu is a little different compared to your typical thai place so I had a lot of questions and the waitress was more than happy to answer them.  The Royal thai platter, mussels were delicious. The pandan iced tea looked awesome but I missed the normal thai iced tea.  This is great and new and different. But if you're feeling like you want your typical Thai dishes, this may not be the place to go. But if you want a cool unique experience with beautifully plated dishes, check it out."}
{"text":"Beautiful.  Food was fun and surprising. Made a horrible day (and weather) at least a bit better. Our server was wonderful and though the restaurant was relatively small, the atmosphere was warm and beautiful."}
{"text":"It's bougie, it's pretty, and it's a decent location.  It used to be Khao San road. It went from a rich cultural vibe where you felt like u were in Khao San to this kinda cute but ultimately bland resort type atmosphere.    Interesting drinks menu (although I didn't have any so not sure if they taste good but the descriptions were cool). Small food menu for brunch. We had the kiin breakfast and the cauliflower. The kiin breakfast was a bit pricy but you do get steak and chicken sausage. The flavours were wonderful but the portions were relatively small. The lemongrass chicken sausage was a really great flavor combination and I really like it. The cauliflower was good as well but small considering its $12. Very intense garlicky flavor.  Overall not bad but probably not gonna make it onto my recommendations list for Thai food downtown."}
{"text":"The smartest thing that the owners did here was ensuring that nothing offered at Kiin was duplicated at any of their wildly successful chain of Thai restaurants - not a pad thai in sight!  The dishes served are unique in the Toronto Thai dining scene and are beautifully prepared.  I don't think I've eaten such a vivid \"rice salad\" (Khao Yum) - the flavours reminded me a lot of Susur Lee's signature Singapore Slaw.  The pricing is at a bit of a premium so this will be a once in a while treat rather than a regular haunt.  The only slight disappointment we had was that the Chuchee Tofu and Mushroom Curry was not piping lava hot when set down."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff! Called to made reservations in the past & they are very good at calling customers back if they missed the call! Favorite was the beef curry - meat fell off the bone & the roti is a must get! Roti is flaky and fresh to order. Lobster tom yum was not great however - didn't taste the sour and spicy tom yum and it was overly salty. Overall good experience though!"}
{"text":"I have seen the sign up on my walk home from work, and have been waiting for this place to open ever since. I love Pai, and was intrigued to try Kiin. I had to try the Roy Thai platter and was surprised by how delicious it was on top of being almost too pretty to eat. The platter is split into savoury and sweet and offers a unique flavour combination for each flower. We also had the mussels which came with a good portion and were delicious with the lime and lemongrass flavouring. Lastly, we shared the Wellington county beef short rib which was out of this world. The meat falls off the bone and the sauce was perfect to soak up in the rice. These dishes were all a 5/5 for me. I just wish there was some more options on the menu (or maybe it will rotate), but I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"The taste of the food is fine , but it doesn't worth that much! Price is really high and quantity is really less .we will never come back."}
{"text":"It's from the same people as Pai except I like Pai a lot better. Went to the soft opening during lunch and it was alright. Waited quite a while (about 30mins) for our food even though the restaurant was less than half full. I ordered the Pandan Iced Tea. It was alright because it tasted like water with a tiny tiny hint of coconut. However, it is very photogenic though so if you are there to take Instagram pictures I definitely suggest this drink. The food I got was the Braised Pork Hock. It looked a little underwhelming since the portions was so small and they  put all of it on such a big plate. My friend ordered the Tom Yum with rice....looked and tasted a lot better. Overall, I'll definitely give it a second chance since I have not had their dinner menu yet."}
{"text":"It's not everyday I get to experience a restaurant that actually blew me away with regards to every aspect of the restaurant. However my experience even if it's just a first time experience is worth while mentioning about just the attention to detail provided for a single night of service.  Food: Our night consisted of 2 Courses of their Large format dishes, the first being the Khao Yum. A unique Southern Thai tossed salad that consisted with a wide variety of ingredients that blended perfectly together. It was definitely a great start to dinner, light and flavourful that stimulated my palate.  For the main course, we shared the Gaeng Boombai. The Short Rib was done extremely well in my opinion with the tenderness being definitely to my favor. Ordered a side of Jasmine rice to accompany the dish and it might sound weird reviewing rice but this damn good rice.  Compliments to the BOH team.  Drinks: We tried two cocktails this evening, I choose the Bangarang which consisted with Japanese whiskey as it's based spirit. While my buddy got the Vincent Vega which was based with Bourbon. Both cocktails we're intricately conceived as we watched the the Bartender make our drinks. All I can say is I'm impressed.   Service: I go to a restaurant for the food but I stay for the service. Might I say Kiin has a exceptional service, from the moment we came in to the moment we left, my service experience just kept elevating. I for one definitely felt welcomed and seeing a happy staff at work definitely uplifts the vibe. Haven't even gotten to the best part yet, as someone who also works in the service industry, I can definitely appreciate the attention to detail in terms of knowing your craft. The server really impressed me with his level of knowledge in knowing his menu items and the finesse of the presentation for even just tossing a salad. You can tell the level of dedication.  Also to top off the evening, as I wasn't expecting things would be getting any better, our Server/Bartender gave us each a complimentary mimosa that just blew me away. Turns out it's was Thai New Year, Songkran, and it was a celebratory gift.   Ambiance: Small cozy restaurant, vibrant scene and very nice decor.  All in all, I would say I am looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"4 stars  I've always wanted to try this place ever since I found out kiin is one of Chef Nuit's newest restaurant! I am a big fan of Pai and Khao San Road.  I was able to visit Kiin with my friend on a Friday evening. My friend who got there first told me the hostess only gave us a 1.5 hour seating limit.  We ended up ordering three dishes, the royal platter which I highly recommend. They are little dumplings with each having a distinct taste and flavour! We also ordered the beef curry and the tofu with mushrooms. We ended up ordering a side of sticky rice and roti to go with the curry. Each dish was spectacular! I feel like these dishes are not as common in other Thai restaurants.   It was overall a good experience and will definitely come back again! However, with the 1.5 hour seating limit it will be hard to catch up with your friends. Less talking more eating!"}
{"text":"Didn't even get a chance to try the food. We booked a table for 4 on a Saturday night. We had called ahead to change the reservation which was confirmed to delay our booking. Still, we had arrived 15 minutes late, so our table was given away. This would have been ok if not for the fact that: 1. We were not aware of this rule 2. The host accused us for not changing the reservation in the first place 3. Telling is she texted us to confirm the booking. None of those texts were received. We verified our contact information which was correct but these texts never arrived. The situation was just made worst with the attitude of the host with no possible resolution."}
{"text":"Adorable interior with more than enthusiastic staff! Definitely get the royal appetizer as it's a work of art and is almost a shame to have to devour. A bit on the pricey side but definitely go check it out if you're into Thai or are a sucker for exotic presentations!"}
{"text":"Came here with my coworkers and loved it! It was pricey but wow, the interior, food, service and attention to detail was amazing! I've never been to an upscale Thai place so this really blew me away. I loved the atmosphere!  For the food we had the testing menu which had basically everything. Their food was soooo flavourful and my favs were the salted fish, the taro/sweet potato chips and the vegan mixed rice salad. Everything was just BEAUTIFUL and very fresh. Service was also good and efficient."}
{"text":"Great food, and great service. We weren't able to make reservations as it was fully booked, and tested our luck by walking in. We were seated by the bar with no wait required.   Kiin serves upper scale Thai food and is located in the old Khao San Road location. The restaurant offers flavored Thai ice teas such as Pandan and Hibiscus, which are both delicious and unique flavors. Food items are generally split between small and large plates, mainly to share with the party. Between two people, we ordered the pork jowl, rice salad and beef rib curry with a side of naan. Every dish was spectacular and flavors were on point - well done Kiin! Definitely look forward to coming back again!"}
{"text":"OK. After almost 3 days of eating sub par suburban restaurant food; fake Japanese sushi and tempanyaki; suspiciously ominous butter fish sushi and a gut full of free breakfast sausages from the hotel. I was rescued by one of my cousins to spend some quality time with over perhaps the best meal I've had since Susar Lee first opened his first restaurant in Toronto some 35 years ago.  That is really saying something special.  You see, when I lived in this big city (decades ago), I always had the comforting knowledge of eating the finest food you could get and I happened to live with one of Toronto's greats in the culinary field, Dinah Koo.  She is a living legend in the Toronto's gourmet catering food service and restaurant field.  Food book writer, queen maven of Asian fusion style food before fusion food was in fashion.  Having her as a mentor in my life in those formative adult years has led me back to this town and now to this restaurant, Kiin.   (A little video I posted right after my dinner there.  You get to hear some of the servers describing the dishes we had that night.  https://youtu.be/74udUZn_z1Y  )  So yes. I made my first trip back to Toronto on a cold winters eve and met with my dear cousin for dinner there.  No reservations, just a drop in for two and we thought we'd take a chance at it since it was voted as one of the top ten in Toronto.  Chef Nuit Regular, Co-owner and Executive Chef at Kiin have done something special here.  Urban chic, Instagrammable, Social and sexy is what I would first describe this place.  The food is spectacular.  Just have a look at the dishes you see posted here on Yelp and you'll get an idea of what people liked and why.  The perfect place for two gals to come down and have a post work day drink which is exactly what the couple seated next to us was doing. Lots of OOhhh's and Ahhh's and OMG that's sooooo delish! Snapchat's, Instagram's, selfies with food and filters is what follows after whenever a new dish arrives.  And so this was what we did too.  At least I did that.  Maybe it's a girls thing? I dunno.  My cousin who's more concerned about his fingers being photographed when all he has to do is walk down a street and the public cameras around town have him walking in action.  Stuff like that in today's world cannot bother you or else your paranoia will get the better of you.  So Kiin.  Why did I give it 5 solid stars? 7 pm, no reservation on a week day and we were able to be squeezed in the last few seats at the kitchen bar looking into the kitchen.  We got to see all the food action going on and it was terrific!  You didn't get to see flaming woks or grills or frying pans in action but the prep was just as effective.  You saw how it was being put together for the customers to feast on.  First with their eyes, then the cameras and then with their tastebuds.  Nearly every dish was as spectacular as the next, entertaining the senses with dazzling colours, shapes and smells before impacting on the tongue with the variety of textures and each chew bringing on a new flavour that has your brain thinking... what is that? Is that lemon grass?  Is that cilantro?  the subtleness and the boldness in mixed flavours somehow triggers a sublime reaction that is nearly orgasmic.  You must start with the Chor Ladda  the most popular appetizer to get.  This will jump start you right away into the world of Kiin and it's cornucopia of delights.  We also had the following dishes which I highly recommend but if I get the chance to come back, I most certainly will try all the other items on the menu, provided wallet can afford it. (My cousin was very gracious enough to treat me to this meal which I am so thankful for.)  Yum Tua Plu  Mussels  Pomelo Salad Khao Yum    Gaeng  Boombai   When you do go there. I know you will (unless you happen to live on a simpleton diet of burgers, steaks and fries). You should find everything to your liking.  This place will make your brain smarter by stimulating the senses and providing you hopefully with new sensations that trigger your synapses.  What I also like is that they provide information for you on the menu if it contains peanuts, if it's gluten free or other.  The staff are very attentive (and busy) but they do a proper delivery of the dishes when describing what you are about to eat.  This place has re-embolden my thoughts on just how good Toronto's food scene can be.  If you just happen to be an adventurous type, I would recommend this place.  A delivery of Royal Thai cuisine unbeknownst to most foodies that I suggest to be tried.  Typo's free of charge with this because my bangs kept blocking my ability to see what I was typing.  True story."}
{"text":"Food was good but definitely not your ordinary Thai place. Think of Thai tapas. Cool concept but not my kind of jam. This is a good spot to share a few small dishes if you're looking for a light dinner and some drinks."}
{"text":"Went to Kiin for dinner today. We ordered the Roy Thai (4 different types of sweet and savory dumplings), grilled pork jowl, the Khao Yum and the Beef Boombai, and two thai ice teas. Total came out to roughly $70 per person after tax and tips. While the meal was good, it wasn't mind blowing, and I feel like the same flavour could have been had at a sister restaurant say Pai, for much less. Especially the Khan Yum, it was basically rice salad with fixings.... and that was $24. I guess you are paying for the presentation and the ambience. Next time, I will probably just walk down the street to Pai."}
{"text":"SERVICE: Came here for brunch on a Sunday @ 12PM, expected a wait but got seated right away. Table of 2. Our server was friendly, helpful, and provided us with suggestions for popular picks. She came to check up on us several times to make sure everything was good.   FOOD: Absolutely delicious and the presentation was ELEVATED. Everything looks like art and almost too pretty to eat! 100% Instagram-worthy pics, as seen in my potato food blog pix :)... We ordered to share, and the portions were generous and filling.  Eggs Benedict: Very flavourful with the thai hollaindaise sauce which was tasty and unique compared to regular hollandaise sauce. The deep fried basa and thai crueller paired perfect together! The house salad on the side was light and tasty.  Crispy Thai Omelette: Great presentation, I really enjoyed the crispiness of the omelette as it gave it texture. The thai hot sauce was just slightly spicy which added a nice touch of flavor.   Chicken Sausage: The sausage was a nice addition and the lemon grass flavor was savoury.   AMBIENCE: LOVE the cute décor!!! The décor and colours of KIIN was feminine and modern with the tiles, rose gold accents on the furniture and frames. If you've been to Khao San Road, it's the exact same size except renovated so it would be advisable to go a little earlier to avoid a wait."}
{"text":"Food was tasty, although the pork jowl we ordered was a bit too salty. The Royal Platter consisted of 4 pieces of dim sum sized appetizers for $12. The presentation of the food was excellent and I could tell they put in s lot of work into some of the dishes. The prices here are higher than at Pai, expect to pay around $70 per person if you want to leave satisfied. Prices are quite high and the food wasn't that memorable for me. The servers didn't really seem to know what was going on as it took them a while to figure out how to use their electronic seating system. The servers were also in a rush to get us out the restaurant, we weren't even finished our food yet they kept asking if they could take away our plates! We sensed their urgency to vacant our seats for other customers so we quickly left and went to get wings at a bar next door. I think I will stick to eating at Pai or Khao San Road next time"}
{"text":"sadly, i think this \"thai\" restaurant is way too \"westernest\" I think it makes the the main Pai to shame, the level selection is just sad,  to me as someone that has have had thai food in bkk and in asia, there is nothing really thai about this place. the 5 color rest etc is cold. flavor is okay. As an Asian i prefer the heat of the rice that gives it flavor making me enjoy my meat dishes more. the chicken is soft and if u remove the soup base there is no lingering favor on the meat.  To me, thai culture and food is giving you that spice and sourness and i think the flavor is tooo cultured towards western."}
{"text":"ok the food here is amazing!!! was going to Pai (but line up was super long) and wanted to have thai food, so stumbled here and I'm so glad we did!  the food is just so flavourful and unique, it's not only pretty, the taste is remarkable and I have returned again already and have plans to come back again!   the dumplings are a must have! the rest you can't go wrong with either.  I actually think the portions are even perfect for 2 to share. for 2 people, have 1 snack, 2 small, and 1 large would be perfect."}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight without a reservation for a table for 4. Luckily, the timing was early enough that the restaurant can accommodate us to get seated around 5:30-6:00pm and we were able to keep the table until almost 7:30pm before their reserved guests arrive.   Location: This is a familiar location where some of you may have seen that it was where Khao San Road used to be. The doorway is on the side but you walk into a completely different layout of the same space.   Atmosphere: love the decor! Great vibe to this place. They took the time to make the place really a nice mix with vintage/modern feel. Love the tiling around the walls (those hexagonal wall tiles) and little details such as the halfway-painted black light bulbs on the ceiling that my friend and I noticed. Wonder if that's why this place is still so dim even with all those light fixtures on the ceiling.  I must say, it is really loud in here once the place is busy -- Although I was sitting in a cozy table of 4-- I felt like I couldn't hear what was said by my friend across from me.  The space between each table /group was perfect. It wasn't too cramped but I must say that this place isn't very big. It is not going to be as easy a few large party groups. Perfect for smaller tables though.   Service: Friendly service and attentive staff. They changed our plates when our mains came (probably because she overheard that I made a comment about my friend's DIRTY PLATE for jokes). But that kind of attentiveness definitely merits my appreciation. They were great to share some of their food recommendations since our whole group was first to try this place.   Food:  2 pages of food options. Honestly, I thought I'd had more selection for their dinner menu. I was actually craving your typical thai noodles and rice for dinner. However, I guess I should have looked up the dinner menu before coming to a surprise for our meal.  This place is known to be a shared experience. We were able to order several small dishes and mains to be split with our group.   Starters: Royal Thai app- colourful and cute arrangements of peanut infused small bite size apps. I'm a big fan of plating and décor. It is a bonus if the plate looks pretty and appealing! The bite size items came in pairs -- obviously for a group of 4 , they recommended that we order 2 of those plates, but we were happy just to order 1 plate to try for starters.  I think it was OK and fun to try a taste and appreciate the plating to start off our night -- but I'll pass next time because each bite was semi sweet/salty peanut infused taste and if you eat it in the order they recommended, you eat the fried dumpling at the end! Still very happy I tried it though!  Pomello salad - my mom makes this type of salad pretty often and so I have a very familiar taste when I eat this. If you have never had it, it is a mix of shredded pomello, crushed peanuts, some chilli flakes/sauce and the key ingredients are the special thai sauce (which is both sweet and sour flavours). They served this on a bed of lettuce and the waiter said we can eat the salad as a wrap or just eat it separately! I enjoyed this refreshing salad very much because I don't often order this at restaurants. THe flavours were also unique since it had incorporated lemon grass and coconut flakes. ALSO-- LOTS OF shrimp were in this salad to enjoy.   Pork jowl- THIS WAS GOOD GOOD! The waitress described the flavours correctly. It has a bit of a smoky flavour to it. If you haven't had pork jowl before --- it is the portion of the pig's neck -- always a fan of eating and cooking this type of meat. It has a good chewy yet tender type of texture. But this dish had so much good spices and seasonings that make it just a little spicy, strong onion taste and a hit of smoky flavour. It is recommended by the chef to alternate with the thai kale served with this dish as well. If eating the thai kale on its own, my friend described the taste as \"raw broccoli\". But I dunked my kale into the sauce of the dish and mixed it with the onions and peppers to get all the flavours for my plain veggie wrap!   Khao Yum - Lots of tables ordered this big bowl of colourful and finely chopped ingredients! They mixed it for you at the table. This was fun to watch them mix as their pour all their sauce at your table. I really didn't know what I was eating (not your typical rice dish). It was not served hot either but a nice mix of textures in your mouth when you share. Definitely the portion was large enough to share with 4 people. I would say it would be too much for 2 people to share since you want to make sure you leave room to try the other dishes.   My FAV -- Curry braised beef with ROTI side order - THIS was sooo good! The beef was braised for 12 hours they say to make it fall off the bone and just full of flavour. The curry was so delish! The roti was perfect for me since it was very light, flaking and stayed crispy.   Will not need to order the pandan or matoo thai tea!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to try Kiin since it first opened but I never got the chance until now! We didn't make a reservation (which i recommend you do) but we got a seat at the full service bar immediately. The hostess was very accomdoating and inviting. The restaurant was very busy but once seated our waitress greeted us right away. She told us that the dishes were meant to be shared and that's what we did!  We were recommended the Royal thai which is a spread of dumpling like dish. It was colourful and really flavorful. Each one placed in the order they are meant to be eaten from sweet to savory. Definitely a highlight at Kiin.  Then we had the khao yum which i have seen all over instagram. This colourful rice salad was blooming with beautiful vibrant colours that you can actually eat and enjoy! It's got a nice kick of spicyness to it that just keep you on your toes!   Finally we ended it with the braised short rib in curry. This dish definitely had more of a traditional thailand flavor with the curry tasting like a panang peanut curry sauce. The coconut rice however was a little underwhelming so I would recommend just getting regular rice.  Overall I really enjoyed everything from the food to the atmosphere and service. I would come back!"}
{"text":"Do not recommend. Unless your sole purpose of dinning here is for Instagram moments? Waiters ask you if you want to take photos before you enjoy the food. This is just trying too hard. Pathetic.  Food was mediocre, flavour of the food offered no complexity, with over use of the spices.   Server was rushed to get us out. No recommendations, no asking how was the food, no refilling the sparkling water bottle, no asking for desert."}
{"text":"Upscale Thai restaurant that has beautiful dishes, but missing some of the vibrant flavours you'd expect to find in a Thai restaurant.   Best dishes were the soft shell crab - super flavorful and crab was cooked perfectly, and the roy thai appetizer platter - tasty and pretty selection of dumplings.  Disappointments were the pork jowl - barely any flavour and pork was dry, and the sea bream - fish was cooked well, but flavour was flat."}
{"text":"I recently heard about Kiin from my cousin, who had been invited to the soft opening by a friend. As a huge fan of Thai food, I was eager to try this upscale Thai restaurant from the same owners of Pai. I recommend making reservations. Hubby and I lucked out to be seated within 30 min of walking in (even though we originally were told the wait for seating would be an hour).   At first glance, the menu was a little intimidating to me as the Thai names of items or ingredients left little indication to me of what I was ordering. The staff were very helpful and walked us through the menu. As we weren't very hungry, we ordered 2 small dishes (Roy Thai and Kang Moo Yang Nam Jim Jaew) and 1 large dish (Gaeng Boombai Nua), and we left feeling satiated and not overly stuffed.   Several Royal Thai dishes are featured on the menu, and the Roy Thai platter consisted of 4 such small savoury bites. The other smaller dish was actually fairly substantial as it came with a generous portion of sliced pork jowl meat served in a tamarind based sauce that had a spicy kick to it. It was refreshing to have kale stalks to eat with this dish to cool down the palate. My fave dish by far was the Gaeng Boombai Nua which is short rib in a sauce very reminiscent of massaman curry - creamy, velvety, peanutty, and delicious! It came with a side of fragrant coconut rice. My only critique about the dish was that it was served with some undesirable bits of fat that I had to pick out.   There is a chef's table for up to 4 people overlooking the kitchen. I was told the offerings in coming weeks would include fresh roti.   Chef Nuit and Jeff Regular have another winner on their hands with Kiin. Although the food was delicious, I personally feel that $28 is fairly steep,  even for short rib curry. That being said, I would definitely order it again!"}
{"text":"Insta-worthy dishes & interior design!!  Must order their Roy Thai - a platter of 4 different unique dumplings (you get two of each). I swear everyone comes here and orders this. The Khao Yum - colourful rice dish was also really different and flavourful. It's a great place to order a few different things and just share. Service was also incredible, she was so patient and informative and went through the menu with us. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I took off a star for Kiin for one reason. The presentation of the food, taste and service were excellent. My one complaint is that when I made a reservation I was told we had to come very early as they were fully booked which we did not want, but agreed to.  For the one and a half hours we were there at least half the restaurant was empty.  I hate it when restaurants force you to take an early dining time just so they can turn a table over. This worked out well for them, but not for us as the customer."}
{"text":"Possibly the best Thai meal I had outside of Thailand. Every dish we ordered was flavourful and beautiful. The restaurant is enchanting, elegant, and as an added plus, the restaurant noise level will not burst your ear drums. Noteworthy: every dish, but I would not pass out the opportunity to order the fruit platter for dessert.   Overall outstanding.  PS: Two small wrinkles that need ironing: a) time between courses is a little long, b) make clear that dishes do not come with rice, you'll have to order as a side."}
{"text":"It's cool to see the transformation of the space from Khao San Road to have more of a light and royal concept in Kiin. Chef Nuit Regular, her husband Jeff, and the Kiin staff are so friendly and welcoming. I had such a great time at Kiin.  I liked these dishes:  Yum Tua Plu ($15) - wing beans   Khao Yum ($24) - red thai rice, tamarind yellow, and butterfly powder green Great for veggie lovers   Mieng Pia ($32)- kale, gem lettuce, pomelo, vermicelli, thai finger haw, salted coriander, mint, peanut, and thai basil  Pandan Iced Tea and the hand-made chips (taro, beet, sweet potato seasoned with lime and tom yum powder) are amazing and a must-try!  I have a mild peanut allergy so be careful when choosing dishes on the menu! I had a delightful time here despite that and would come back for the chips"}
{"text":"Hello from Boston!  I had the opportunity to visit Toronto this weekend and I happened to stumble across kiin!  We were planning to go to Pai Northern (same owner) but the line was out the door and it was really cold. On our way back to our car we saw kiin and looking from the outside it looked like a beautiful place.  Environment: the decor was absolutely beautiful. It was one of the most interesting decor I've seen in a while. Great place to go on a date.  Staff: extremely friendly staff. We were seated promptly (even though we didn't have reservations). They kindly took our jackets and made our experience as amazing as possible.  Food: oh the food!! We started off with the winged bean salad and i wish I could explain how good it was!!! It was a touch spicy but not overwhelming and the duck egg was amazing to cleanse our palates. Would highly recommend this. We got another small plate but i can't remember the name (see picture). They were small tapas that went from sweet to savory, would also highly recommend trying. And finally we got Khao Yum, it had so much color and SO MUCH FLAVOR. Definitely a party in my mouth.    Overall, if you love Thai cuisine absolutely make an effort to go to Kiin!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful food, great atmosphere. Favourite dish was the khao yum, so fresh and light but with lots of flavour. The other contender being the beef rib, which we ordered a side of coconut rice to go with. So nutty and rich and delicious. On the list for a repeat visit. Num!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me out to dinner here one night, having saved this on her recommended list of Thai places to try in the city.   The meals were so intricate and colorful, almost too pretty to eat. Every meal was so freshly made with purpose and detail.   The staff was nice enough to thoroughly explain what each meal was made of and how to eat it properly. The cuisine is mixed of sweet, sour and savory. It is worth ordering several dishes and sharing them.  Perfect place for authentic Thai cuisine!"}
{"text":"Dine like Thai royalty! At least that is what I imagined while eating at Kiin. Each dish was gorgeous and flavors reminded me of that from the old country. Still, price is rather steep for what you get - portions are small.   Food: - Royal Thai platter with 4 types of dumplings (2 each). Not to be missed. - Khao Yum. Rice dish with cucumber, pomelo, fried chili and sprouts. This is tossed with tamarind, soy sauce and spices. The colors are dazzling and it tastes good too.  - Beef short ribs. Melts off the bone and goes great with rice.  - Pomelo salad - My favorite because I always like Pomelo (tastes like a sweet grapefruit).  - Chuchee Tofu and mushroom - This is a veggie curry. Not really my kind of dish but my Vegetarian friend enjoyed alot.  Service: Seems fine.  Did not really pay attention as we were having a really good time among ourselves.  Perhaps that is the best kind of service one may hope for - unobtrusive without being lacking.  Other: Ambience is less \"royal\" - no prob.  Only knocks against Kiin are the price and small serving for each dish.  All in (food, taxes, 18% tip), the meal works out to approx. $50 per person.  Overall: I would definitely like to return perhaps to celebrate a special occasion or birthday."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch (very good) and subsequently dinner (even better). The first thing that struck me about this restaurant is how beautiful the decor is: lots of gold/copper accents, dark green, and marble. Gorgeous. The food was amazing and the service was exceptional. Their wines were great and the prices quite reasonable. The server even gave us complimentary coconut jelly to soothe our mouths after eating too many hot peppers. I tried several things on the menu, and after careful deliberation I can confidently recommend the following dishes:  - Khao Tung Nah Tang - shrimp crackers with a crab dip, looked meh but tasted amazing! - Roy Thai Dumpling Platter - do not skimp at order one platter per two people. These dumplings were truly beautiful little works of art, inventive and delicious. - Yum Tua Plu - wing bean stir fry. From the menu description it didn't sound too appealing but we took our server's word for it and lo and behold it was great - Khao Yum rice - delicious medley of different coloured rice and fragrant flowers/herbs - Beef short rib - SOOOO good especially with their house-made roti dipped in the delicious sauce  I would pass on the grilled pork jowl - it was fine but not as amazing as the other dishes.   After all those dishes and two bottles of wine for the table, it came to ~70 per person after tip. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you're a Thai Food lover, you would be familiar with the husband and wife team Chef Nuit & Jeff Regular's empire of Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto namely Sukhothai, Pai, Sabai Sabai and the new restaurant Kiin.  Kiin which means 'eat' in Thai occupies where Khao San Road is situated before.   Upon entering the restaurant, you will be greeted in Thai by a very nice and friendly host.    You can already tell this is no ordinary Thai restaurant judging by how the interior looks. The place itself is so lush and gorgeous with marbled floors, glass shutters and gold accents everywhere. It also looks more spacious as compared to when it was Khao San Road.  The lunch menu is very limited which consist only of three choices in different categories such as Snack, Soup, Salad, Rice, Noodle, Curry.  I decided to try a noodle dish, Pad See Ew to see if they taste authentic - and damn right it is! They got it right with the sauce, perfect balance of salty and sour. It has also has a wonderful chargrilled flavour from a result of continuous high heat cooking. And the Sen Yai noodles - so fresh and chewy. I just wish they would give you more of the noodles as the dish has more veggies and chicken than noodles.  My SO ordered the Tom Yum Gai with Konjac Noodles. Konjac Noodles if you're not familiar is also known as the 'Wonder Noodle' because it has no starch so it's no fat, low carb, low cal and gluten free. Be warned that they don't ask you for the spiciness level and it is a little bit spicy. But boy it was good! The broth has all the exotic Thai flavours and the chicken was so tender.  This is comparable or even better to the Thai street foods we ate in Bangkok.  If you also like Pandan, you should try their Pandan Ice Tea. It's not sweet but with the addition of pandan leaves, this drink is so fragrant and I really enjoyed it.   Although it's pricier compared to other Thai resto, the portions are huge and they don't skimp on the ingredients. Plus if you want quality food, the price doesn't really matter.  Once again, the Regular's have proven that when it comes to authentic Thai food nothing beats them. You don't even have to travel to Thailand to eat authentic Thai food since Toronto has the best Thai restaurants!   I will surely come back here to try their dinner menu and also to recommend this restaurant to friends and families."}
{"text":"This place used to be where the old Khao San Road was. This place is a different sort of experience than the other Thai places like Pai, Sabai Sabai and Khao San Road. These dishes are geared towards thai royalty and you can see that in the pictures that there's a lot more preparation as well as emphasis on presentation.   I'd say the service was quite good, but near the end of the meal, they sort of forgot about us. Which is weird because I feel like the bill should be the fastest part.  We ordered the Roy Thai platter, Pad Buab Jae, and Kua Hang Gai with a side of Jasmine Rice ~$68. One thing to note is that these prices are for a whole dish, which are not meant to be for individuals. These are shared dishes.   The Roy Thai platter is their signature dish and it is a 2 each of 4 unique dumplings and they look like a work of art. They start from sweet to spicy and meaty, but still refreshing with the cucumber. I didn't like it at first, but as the tasting went on, it grew on me. The Pad Buab Jae had a bit of a kick to it, but I much prefer having some regular choi sum miu. I liked the Kua Hang Gua and it was pretty spicy. It was actually too spicy, but when you ate it with the basil, it mellowed out and became quite nice.   I'd probably take somebody here if you'd want to impress, but would not recommend getting a chicken stir fry (only because that doesn't follow through with the impress bit). The Mieng Pla seemed to be pretty tasty because the table besides us devoured it quite quickly!  Personally I would prefer a thai style closer to Pai and it is pricier.  Service: 4.0 / 5 Food: 3.5 / 5 Price Point: 3.5 / 5  Overall: 3.75 / 5"}
{"text":"My friend and I came for lunch on a Thursday. The food and the interior definitely worth Four stars. However, the service is not that good.  Food: 1. Thong Thong  This is a type of golden fried dumplings that tastes average, too crispy on the outside, not worth the price.  2. Tom Yum Gai The Tom yum gai is soooo good. The broth is creamy and very flavorful with chicken. You can also order a vegan version of this. I like it that it tastes less sugary than the Tom yum soup from Pai.  (FYI, The owners of kiin also own other Thai restaurants: Pai, Sabai Sabai, Khao San Road. 3. A stir-fried chicken noodle dish( forgot the name) My friend ordered this dish and it was delicious. However, I find it tastes more like Chinese food rather than Thai. The portion is large.  The waitresses in this restaurant are very laid back and  never check on customers. We waited 15 minutes for the waitress to look at us. And this place is small and not busy during a Thursday at lunch hours. After we told her we want the bill. It took her another 15 minutes to bring the bill, and another 15 minutes to bring the machine! And at that time we are the only customers that need their attention.   I do see myself coming again someday at dinner time. The lunch menu is good but still too limited."}
{"text":"I would describe Kiin as the more sophisticated big sister to Pai and Khao San Road.  Yes... this also means it's more $.  The decor is more posh and thoughtful, the menu more refined, but the service levels remain friendly, attentive, and super-professional, and the FOOD is excellent. A carefully curated wine list ties itself straight to the food offerings.  The California red was excellent with the food we had. The dishes are colorful, original, and quirky - and the flavors and variety really matched up.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great service and cute spot. Beef rib was the best and be sure to get the berry rice to go with it. I wish I had the home made roti. Beautiful dumplings."}
{"text":"It was really great ! This is one of the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to. Delicious food and a nice atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday! The restaurant wasn't as full as I imagined, which was good! We got seated at the back couches which was nice and cozy.  They really did a great job of revamping Khao San Road. This place is SO CUTE!!   I got the Thai Fried Omelette, and it tasted really special. I've never had anything like it before. There were a bit too many fried bits and I wish they had more egg.   Perhaps I'll be back for dinner to try their signature dumplings!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a Saturday night, and we were not too impressed initially, but the food made it worth while.  First, we had a reservation for 7 but were not seated until about 7:30. That wasn't a problem, as it was a nice night and we sat on a bench outside and perused the menus. Shortly after being seated (just after getting our water glasses filled and before placing our drink order), the hostess popped by and said, \"Just to let you know, we need your table for a reservation at 8:30.\" .... ummm excuse me?! We just sat down, and you expect us to finish our meal in an hour?! So I guess we're just going to be rushed through are food and shouldn't expect to be able to order an appetizer, main, and dessert, if we want?! Clearly we were not too pleased with this statement. When one of the waiters passed our table we asked if we could be moved to a different table that we would not be required to vacate in an hour and that was away from the windows (tip: you can feel a draft by the windows, so wouldn't want to sit near them in the winter). This waiter went off to check for us. Then a different waiter appeared to take our drink order and we explained our request. At this point, someone (who I assume was one of the managers) stuck his head in and briskly told us that things were taken care of and we would not have to leave by 8:30. Great! We were finally able to enjoy our evening. A further note on the service - after the initial rocky start to our meal, it would have been nice if the manager had checked in on us again later to make sure we were enjoying ourselves, but alas, that did not occur.  Decor: refined casual - think gold framed pictures, accents of pastel colours, and a certain feminine flare to the room. It's definitely more elegant in appearance than Khao San Road, Sukho Thai, Pai, or Sabai Sabai.  Food: matching the decor, also more refined than any of the chef's other restaurants. I wanted to order a tea to drink, but they didn't have any hot water yet... weird. Rather than make this statement for every dish, I'm just going to say outright that I think the dishes are overpriced. Yes, they are unique, but I thought everything was overpriced considering the serving size (except the mussels). We ordered:  1) Mun Tawt Ruammit ($9) - taro root, sweet potato, and zucchini chips sprinkled with Tom yum spices. Personally I didn't taste much of the Tom yum and actually found them to be quite salty.   2) Pad Buab Jae ($10) - Sliced gourd with garlic and basil. I really enjoyed this dish. There are many layers to the flavour of this dish with a strong smokey element. We both agreed that we would have preferred it had the gourd been crunchy or crispy.   3) Hoi Nung Ta Krai ($14) - Roasted mussels with lemongrass broth. Phenomenal. So delicious and most definitely worth the price! And the way it is served is just gorgeous! This was by far my favourite dish. I just kept going back for more!  4) Khao Yum ($24) - this is essentially a flavoured rice dish. Yes, it's gorgeous and includes some interesting components (pomelo, kaffir lime, and fried chili to list a few), but it's maybe one and a half cups of rice total and maybe 1-2 tbsp of each seasoning. I'm glad I ordered it once for the photo, but I wouldn't order it again. The waiter was right though - the photo does turn out better with flash!   5) Dessert ($15) - they only had one dessert option on the night that we went, and it was a fruit platter. This consisted of two wedges of pomelo, four lychees, two mangosteens, and about 1/4 of a mango. The pomelo was so fresh and delicious, but I'm biased because pomelo is quite possibly my favourite fruit and it has been out of season for awhile, so I'm always happy to get some. Save your money on dessert and grab something special elsewhere.  Although overpriced, I will still return because the food was yummy, and I hope they have the kinks (in the service and the hot water) worked out by then!"}
{"text":"Super interesting flavours! Eating here was not an ordinary restaurant experience - it was an experience that exercised all my taste buds and engaged my mind by really making me think about the food I was eating. I'd definitely go back here for a special occasion. They also have great service!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Dinner at Kiin was amazing. We didn't have reservations but were able to get 2 seats at the bar around 5:30pm. Presentation, taste, décor and service were all excellent.   Roy Thai - royal Thai dumplings, $12/person for 4 pcs - Def. a must order (contains peanuts). My favorite was the blue one and the deep fried one.   Khao Yum - the colourful rice dish mixed with a variety of herbs/spices. Really a feast for the eyes, but taste-wise it was too spicy for me. My mouth was burning!!   Sea Bream - salt baked, served with lettuce wraps (baby gem lettuce & Thai kale which is like Gai Lan). The fish was similar to Chinese steamed fish, I really liked the herbs that were stuffed inside and the salt crust was tasty. Overall, the fish + lettuce + vermicelli + green sauce is a good pairing, a light yet filling dish. The server debones it for you but still be careful when eating.   Service was good and attentive. Price: $50/person."}
{"text":"The food here does not disappoint.  The flavours are refreshing. The amount of detail that goes into each dish, each ingredient, and the decor amount to a very pleasant and enjoyable experience.  I foresee long waits in the future once word gets out. Until then, check this place out as I don't know of any other in Toronto that serves the same quality of food."}
{"text":"More like a Thai fusion. I will not  recommend if you want real Thai food. The food size is small even is \"Large\". Four people came here, ordered 2 large, 3 small, one rice, not even half full. The taste is also not very satisfying. Also, the washroom is extremely small and narrow, im normal petite size woman. The environment is ok."}
{"text":"Ever since my first bite (at Pai), I've been in love with Chef Nuit's food. I may even have to declare her my favourite chef. Sorry, Susur. Her flavours are rich and so perfectly balanced. At Kiin, she takes the presentation to another level. it's worth taking a close look (and several pictures) of the intricacy of each piece of food on the plate.  I've been looking forward to this visit and I had the best company, JK, Sunny, May, and Fatza.  We ordered just in time to take advantage of a happy hour special on cocktails, a margarita for JK and a whisky sour for me.  Our first dish, Roy Thai (royal thai platter with mha hor, chor ladda, rhoom, and thoong thong), was an assortment of dumplings, each one a piece of art - the colours, the shapes, the textures, the flavours. It tasted pretty darn good!  Speaking of art, the next dish, Khao Yum (jasmine rice. rice berry white turmeric, long beans, lemongrass, sawtooth coriander, kaffir lime leaves, cucumber, toasted coconut, pomelo, fried chilli, sunflower sprouts, edible flowers, tamarind and soy bean sauce), was a masterpiece. Imagine an artist's palette, with colours carefully laid out, ready to paint, that's what this reminded me of. All the wonderfully colourful ingredients, including coloured rice, were laid out individually, a masterpiece in itself. Our server gave us enough time to capture the images before blending everything into a very delicious salad. Damn, that's good!  The Pork Jowl (grilled pork jowl tamarind, roasted rice, mint, roasted red chilli, Thai kale stalks)  was perhaps the most flavourful dish and the meat was very tender with just the right amount of smoke. We were instructed to wrap the meat in kale before eating. OMG!  The Pandan Chicken (marinated chicken wrapped in pandan leaf, sweet chilli sauce) had each piece of chicken wrapped in a leaf that had to be removed before dipping in a sweet chili sauce and eating. Other than the presentation, this was the most \"ordinary\" dish that we had, although ordinary is not a word I would use to describe any of this food.  The food, presentation, and service were all outstanding! I was happy. Chef Nuit rocks!"}
{"text":"Kiin is a Thai restaurant that avoids the typical pad thai and other overly-noodled dishes.  They creatively and aggressively use a variety of Thai flavours and foods to create unique dishes.  Our party was very unimpressed with the food, but loving of the staff.  The food had some themes: way too many flavours, too much sugar, too much oil, and overcooking.  The rice salad was bland and boring.  The dumplings, while pretty, were diabetes in a ball.  Fish was overcooked and rubbery (tasted unfresh).  Lobster tom yum soup had an unpleasant taste. like oyster sauce or fish sauce.  The bean dish was very good but very oily.  Pomelo and shrimp salad was a huge disappointment, with strongly conflicting and excessive flavours.  Drinks were good.  I gave it 2 stars only because the staff (a young guy) was so attentive and knowledgeable, and the hostess was efficient and personable.  It's an amazing idea to do creative Thai and veer away from the boring curries and pad thai, but Kiin missed the mark.  Maybe after some time they'll grow to nail the ideas they've got - for now it's not there."}
{"text":"Think of Kiin as an new Thai experience to be savored versus the typical carb-heavy food run to your neighborhood Thai joint. The attention to detail is in every aspect, from their amazing food, excellent service, and aesthetic atmosphere. The space isn't big, which means less seats but it's been lovingly decorated in shades of gold, pink and green. Everything is meant to be beautiful and detailed, which sums up to a an amazing dining experience.  The food reflects their aesthetic. Their Royal Dumpling Platter is an excellent example of their dedication to detail. Each dumpling had it's own distinct flavor and texture, and there was obviously alot of thought and attention placed on making each one, even when each one could all be devoured in a bite or two. The Pork Jowl dish was cooked perfectly, so the meat was on that fine line of being chewy, crisp and soft all at the same time. It was my favorite dish of the night based solely on texture and flavor. Lastly, the Salted sea bream was a new way to experience fish. We watched them laborously debone the fish and it was presented to us with the little pockets of lettuce and toppings to eat with. It was light, fresh and full of contrasting textures and flavors.  A new level of Thai dining!"}
{"text":"The short ribs was probably one of the best thing I've ever had. So tender and tasty. The pandan drink was tasty and refreshing. The dumplings threw different flavours at you. Service was great. Although it was a small space, they managed to make the best of it. I didn't find the decor so thai, but it definitely has a very artistic touch."}
{"text":"It's always a little disappointing when the quality of the food isn't up to the level of the ambiance, service, and price.  That's exactly what happened during our recent visit to Kiin. The place is certainly selling itself as a fancier than average Thai place, with its somewhat lavish atmosphere and obsequious wait staff. And indeed, I have absolutely no complaints about how we were treated all night. (Our water was literally topped up every few minutes or so.)  I should also note that the restaurant was celebrating Songkran, the Thai New Year, by handing out free drinks. (I opted for the cocktail, which was admittedly delicious.)  We decided to order three things:  Pandan Chicken (\"marinated chicken wrapped in pandan leaf, sweet chilli sauce\"): This was probably the most disappointing dish of the night, ultimately. The biggest problem was that the chicken was quite dry and flavorless, although, admittedly, it tasted okay once dipped in the tasty sweet chilli sauce.  Pork Jowl (\"grilled pork jowl tamarind, roasted rice, mint, roasted red chilli, Thai kale stalks\"): And this was my favorite dish of the evening, though I wasn't blown away. The grilled pieces of pork jowl were all cooked quite well, while the various accompaniments complemented the dish perfectly. This tastes like an almost prototypical Thai dish, honestly.  Kua Hang Gai (\"braised chicken stir-fry with lemongrass, Thai garlic and buffalo basil\"): This plentiful dish is certainly quite edible - the chicken was cooked well and the extremely mild flavors work nicely together - but again, nothing stood out about it.  For the prices Kiin is charging, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect more than just a completely average meal."}
{"text":"Kiin joins the races for the best Thai restaurant in Toronto, and it certainly surprises, but not without a few caveats. Kiin replaces the famous Khao San Road establishment, and promises to present authentic thai dishes not offered anywhere else, and I've think it's partially succeeded.   Kiin rids of the traditional formula of pad thai, fried rice, an khao soi curries, and replaces it with dishes you won't find anywhere else in Toronto. We visited during their soft launch, and ordered most of the dishes on the menu. The dishes, such as the stir fry pork and the braised beef, were assertive and bold with flavours, not shy to use an abundence of fish sauce and lime to boost the flavour. But other dishes, such as the salted baked fish, lacked any resemblance of flavour, despite it's authentic presentation. Despite that, the restaurant itself is charming and inviting, staff was attentive and helpful in recommending these new dishes we've never seen before.   In a city with such high standards for Thai food, Kiin is on the right track to be one of the top contenders. But will it win over the traditional dishes with these new creations? I'm not sure."}
{"text":"I came for my birthday with some friends. We shared four dishes for four of us and we were full (maybe we weren't super hungry). But the dishes we got were tasty and different from your other Thai restaurants in the neighbourhood (Pai, Khao San Road etc) that serve the usual pad Thai dishes.   We had the Wing Bean and Pomelo Salad, Khao Yum and some chicken dish. They were all great. Dessert isn't really a highlight so I wouldn't bother saving room for that.   The ambience is nice, newly decorated since it was Khao San Road and quiet enough to be in a group and hear each other.   Tip: When I looked on Open Table a week before to reserve, there was no vacancy. I called instead and they had a space for me."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, in the mood for Thai and excited to try somewhere new. Turns out, it's not SO new - head chef is also that of Pai. You just know the food's gonna be good.  All dishes for lunch are $14, with seven options for mains (3 rice dishes, 3 curry dishes and a specialty dish) in addition to a \"create your own noodle soup bowl\" where you have the options of your noodle, soup base & protein. I opted for the Gaeng Karee (deep fried chicken or tofu with yellow curry served with jasmine rice) when I was told my first choice of Khao Moo Grob (crispy pork served with rice and pork gravy) wasn't available and kindly informed (thankfully!) that my second  choice of Gaeng Kua Gai (red curry chicken and betel leaves with jasmine rice) was a 7/10 on the spice scale (I don't handle spice well...)  Turns out, the Gaeng Karee is much like a chicken katsu, sauce served on the side \"so that the chicken doesn't get soggy in the sauce, and you can put as much or as little as you like\" - GENIUS. I, personally, took to dipping each piece into the sauce. The chicken was perfectly crisp, and the curry is easily the tastiest yellow curry I've ever had, with just the hint of a kick that even the wussiest of palates (such as mine) can handle. Not to mention it was the perfect ratio of rice to chicken and the right portion size to leave neither feeling hungry nor overfull.  Can't wait to come back to try some more!"}
{"text":"coconut waffle&crispy Thai omelette ?Supper cool place for weekend brunch, love it. Went this morning with my friend for brunch. Service here was really nice and friendly, we ordered Bandan iced teas but it was sold out. Definitely will go for dinner next time."}
{"text":"we went to visit Kiin  a Thai cuisine restaurant location on Adelaide. As we noticed,  in the Asian culture sharing food is very important part of the culture. I think that's the reason why the menu was designed into Small, medium, large, instead of appetizers, main. Chef Nuit   executive chef at Kiin, designed a menu for locals to come in and enjoy traditional dishes from all around Thailand.  We had:  Chor Ladda: Jasmine rice flour, peanut, onion, picked radish. Beef Boombai: braised AAA Wellington country beef short rib with tamarind, fried cucumber, and pearls onion  Stuffed squid: squid, chicken and the shrimp stuffing, chuchee sauce, coriander roots, white pepper, Thai garlic.  Sisters: their poplar cocktail  ."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today with friends and we were blown away with everything.  We started with the roasted PEI mussels for our appetizer. The broth and lime-infused sauce that came along with it was so flavourful and delicious! I could've inhaled that all my myself if I wanted to. I had the Khao Mun Gai with the poached chicken option for my main. The chicken was so tender and delicious! It reminded me of Hainese chicken. The winter melon soup that came with it was refreshing and light. I paid $26 (before gratuity) for my meal with the mussels split with a friend.  From the beginning to the end of our lunch we had great service and a delicious meal. I would definitely return and recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I really like Pai, so when I heard the same chef opened Kiin, I was excited to check it out! I came here for lunch and a few weeks later for dinner. Both times the food were good but the price point is also higher than Pai. Bonus is the cute mid-century modern decor which I loved!  Lunch - ordered the Tom Yum Soup with chicken and bunched noodles. Great flavours, a solid Tom yum. Chicken was tender too! Definitely filling enough for lunch, especially because you are supposed to drink the soup! But by the time I was done eating all the chicken and noodles, I was already too full to drink all of the soup!    Dinner - royal thai platter is a must for appetizer, really enjoyed trying the four different kinds of Thai dumplings, all uniquely flavoured! For mains, we shared the khao yum, gaeng boombai , and kua hang gai. My favourite was the gaeng boombai which is short rib beef in something like curry. The beef falls off the bone and the sauce was amazing. We ordered some rice berry (sort of like purple rice) on the side, and those were some super awesome tasting rice, like I can eat it alone. I didn't really like the taste of kua hang gai, but that's just my personal taste. Overall great dinner! Would just recommend them to add more options to the dessert menu because right now they only have roti with condensed milk."}
{"text":"A very different experience for Thai food. The restaurant is small and cozy. I loved all the decor and thought that our waitress was very good with recommending dishes for the table. Overall, I enjoyed the fact that all the flavours here were very refined. We ordered the following:  -Root vegetable chips with tom yum spice - recommended appetizer and honestly, if you're a fan of Tom yum, you'll like this a lot, there was a variety of different vegetables (taro, squash, etc)  -Mussels - I am a big fan of mussels and honestly, this was right up my alley with the lemongrass flavour -Chuchee Tofu and Mushroom - I loved the flavour of the curry which we paired with some naan but the tofu and mushroom was just a big bunch on mush in my opinion - Gaeng  Boombai Nua (beef short rib) - I don't really remember how I felt about this dish to be honest but the meat was tender and off the bone.  Overall, the dining experience was nice but I found the place quite pricey and portions weren't huge. We found ourselves having to order some rice and two naan side dishes to use with the main dishes."}
{"text":"Royal appetizer was our favourite thing to order. Not ideal for sharing because you get four tiny but delicious assorted pieces. Our favourite piece was the small wonton. I wanted 100 more after!   We also ordered the Mieng Pla (Sea salt-crusted whole sea bream with Thai garlic, Thai basil, finger mint, peanut, ginger, shallot, and lime in Thai kale leaves)  - This dish was light and refreshing. Nothing was wrong but it missed the spot for me. It wasn't my cup of tea. Sometimes your bite can be quite salty.   But our favourite main was the savoury  Gaeng  Boombai Nua (Braised AAA Wellington County beef short rib with tamarind, field cucumber, and pearl onions). When it comes to our mains, savoury is the way to go. It was tender and fall off the bone. Even the way it looked with a giant bone looked majestic!   The place was beautifully decorated. I'd like to try this alcoholic drinks next time. It was pretty."}
{"text":"I would give this 4.5 stars if I could.  We ordered: Roy Thai - four different kinds of appetizers as tasty as they were beautiful.  There was one that I liked less than the others, but it was still extremely flavourful. Pork jowls- this was larger than I expected, since it was listed under the Small plates.  The Thai kale served with it was a great alternate to the flavours in the pork. Chuchee mushrooms and tofu - wow, this was amazing!  The batter on the mushrooms was really light, so don't feel guilty about eating something deep fried.  This was also larger than expected.  Two tables near us asked what it was so they could order it too.  This was more than enough food for two of us.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"3While nearby, I called for a last minute same day Saturday reservation and they were able to accommodate us, but I was warned at least 6-8 times on the phone witnessed by my friend that we had to finish by 8pm because they needed the table for a group of 8 (our reservation was at 6pm).  On arrival 30 minutes later, we were warned again that we had to finish by 8pm.  My tasty squid entree was served lukewarm (not piping hot or even hot) for $26 and I had it with a half bowl of rice shared with my friend ($5 rice shared between my friend and I - definitely needed the rice to feel as if you had an entree).  My friend ordered ribs ($26) and said it was tasty and also lukewarm in temperature.  When we left, I was tempted to tell them we finished 1 hour early (@ 7pm) and it was the food that took than for us to eat LOL.  My friend was tempted to tell them that we finished early too.  I think the place is simple yet cutely decorated, but overpriced food, especially if entrees arrive barely lukewarm and the constant scolding reminder, as if you're a bad child to finish within 2 hours was annoying."}
{"text":"It was not a perfect experience, but the Regulars who are also responsible for Pai around the corner, should be considered national treasures. Firstly, I often joke that Pai should pay me royalty. I have been there so many times since opening and moreover have either taken friends or told friends to go who not only have kept dining there, but have taken their friends and so on. Whereas Pai serves northern Thai street food Kiin ('eat' in Thai) is meant to offer food that the royal family eats in Thailand. Now the Thai government and politicians have no respect for the Thai royal family having ignored them, silenced them and most recently not even allowing the new king take the throne, but putting all of that aside Kiin serves good food apparently fit for a king in a faux-posh setting that is sure to end up on the huge wastes of time that is Instagram/Twitter/Pinterest/Whocares they will all join Facebook and Myspace as yesterday's news soon.  Back to Kiin and the lunch menu is limited. The full menu inclusive of their dyed dumplings is available for dinner. The lunch menu is comprised of three curry dishes, three rice dishes and a make-your-own noodle soup fare. The last one includes all sorts of noodles, different meats and soup base. I had the Khao Kha Moo, which despite its name is braised pork hock served on rice with greens and half an egg. The sour dipping sauce is tasty and different. Its orange colour is also a delight. I would order this again, but the five-spice pouring sauce should be used sparingly as it can overwhelm and dampen the meal if completely used. It was tasty and felt high quality. My friend had meat with flat noodles and Tum Yum and really enjoyed it. Good food to be found here for sure. The soup is served with condiments like sugar, chili peppers and Thai fish sauce.  Each meal is $14, which takes me to another point of praise for the Regulars. They are not coasting on their well-earned reputation to try to make money, make an excuse of the location, charge extra from a near-captive audience or simply forget what made them successful in the place and become greedy. It may be food fit for a king - and the royal family's portraits and photos are on the wall - but it is not expensively sold at Kiin. What's more, the lunch menu has no appetizers or desserts listed and the waiters did not try to sell alcohol, pop or whatever. I am not against appetizers or dessert and often order them, but again have to tip my hat to the owners who are more about their art, passion and customers than revenue, balance sheet and gross profit.  As for the setting, which I have already touched upon, it looks like one of those colonial estate houses one sees in movies set in India 150 years ago where the local Indian workers serve food to their colonial British masters. Imperialism aside, the colour scheme and decoration is the exact opposite of Pai. Whereas Pai is dark, cluttered and casual, Kiin is posh, decorated with a few fancy pieces and white tiles, white and pink ceiling and walls. The bar panel does have that wooden side though. The restaurant is clean, but of course it is new. With that said, there were several crumbs on the floor and on the cushion and a piece of food was caught between the leg of the adjacent table. Not good. The only problem with the setting is the Motown soundtrack. When I dine at a Thai restaurant I prefer to hear Thai music and not The Supremes, unless the old king of Thailand was a big fan of Marvin Gaye.  The service was polite, but workmanlike. Just like at Pai or Sukhothai none of the waiters or waitresses like to smile, but the water refills kept coming and there was a quality check. It seems that their hiring criteria include having tattoos, which is fine I guess as long as that is not the job requirement in the kitchen. Hepatitis C is linked to tattoos. Speaking of which, theirs is an open kitchen and there are counter seats next to it.   Not only the Regulars serve good food at decent prices in interesting settings they have saved Toronto from all the Chinese/Indian/Filipino and yes Thai cooks who serve that crappy-sugary-ketchupy pad Thai at their inferior restaurants."}
{"text":"FOOD/DRINK - The congee was wonderful. Had all the fixings and tastes just like home. The perfect comfort food, especially on a rainy day. - The King Cobra mocktail was basically limeade; the regular lime dominated the kaffir lime tincture and I don't remember tasting/smelling any kaffir. Nevertheless, it was a very refreshing (and aesthetically pleasing!) beverage.  SERVICE - Excellent service. Zero complaints.  PRICE - Pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night and the restaurant was packed. We had a reservation therefore we were seated immediately. Similar to the old khao san road set up, there's a dining area and a bar. The interior is pretty and instagrammable.   Kiin is brought to you by the same people behind Pai but the dishes served here are unique in Toronto. They are inspired by the northern Thai cuisine and you can't find any curry or pad thai on the menu. Our server suggested ordering three to five small dishes and two to three large dishes for the three of us as the dishes are meant for sharing. My favourite was the royal Thai platter. It came with four different dumplings. The flavours were unique and they were almost too pretty to eat. My personal favourite was the purple one with jasmine rice filling. Highly recommended!   We also tried the grilled pork jowl with kale stalks, khao yum jasmine rice, and the chicken stir fry. Everything tasted good and but the khao yum was a little too spicy (even my native Thai friend found it too spicy).  Overall, great food and great service. Will come back to try other dishes and their lunch menu."}
{"text":"Kiin was definitely an experience.   Came here with a few girl friends for dinner on Monday evening. We arrived before the dinner rush so it was nice to see what the place looked like. Sure it's not large like other dinner values but it is beautiful.   The drinks look just as good as they taste. Anything from alcoholic to non alcoholic to Kombucha. I strongly recommend the Iced Teas. Everything is meant to be shareable. They have recommendations based on group sizes but you're obviously welcome to get whatever your heart contents.   We started with the mussels which were AMAZING. I think the added ewas the sauce that came with it. We also got to Roy Thai dumpling platter. The flavours were really refreshing and paired quite well. Then we had the Sea Bream. Added bonus is that they take out the fish bones and leave nothing but meat and ginger and garlic near the head. Again, they provide that green sauce to pour over the fish when you eat it with the lettuce leaves.   Kua Hang Gai + jasmine rice was suppose to best of the best. However, my friend and I felt a little underwhelmed by the dish. It had nothing memorable to it. It lacked flavours and spices. I didn't even have a tang of spicy which was unfortunate since that what we were looking forward to most.   Although the chicken dish didn't live up to OUR expectations doesn't mean it won't for you. It's definitely a place to try at least once. I do plan to return and try other dishes on the menu.   Overall, our experience was a very positive one. The decor was beautiful. Even the bathroom theme was memorable. I liked the stall's door knobs. The service is top line. So be sure to tip your server what they deserve. It's a lot of work remembering everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've everrrrrr had in my lifeee! theres no coincidence that the majority of the customers were ladies cause duh the aesthetic of this restaurant is SO on trend! who doesn't love millennial pink washroom doors??!!! When I think of Thai food, I think of pad Thai, mango salad and tom yum soup this and that lol But you won't get that typical stuff here! this place is opened by the owners of Pai so basically they just upgraded their old restaurant. their vision is to present thai fine dining with essential thai flavours without the typical stuff you get and i think they nailed it! I had the khao yum (rice salad), pork jowl, royal Thai platter (bite sized work-of-art appetizers) and coconut rice. Not only is the presentation innovative, fun, colourful and nothing Ive seen before , The flavours are sooo pungent, aromatic and fresh! Each bite is a legit party. Every dish i had, they made sure they incorporated some sort of herb or ingredient that freshens up the palette. okay i'm sorry i'm doing this place no justice. just go try it out yourself!!! i need to come back asap myself"}
{"text":"Came for here for dinner on Wednesday and the food and drinks were delicious.   What we had:  Royal Thai platter - the presentation was absolutely stunning and the flavours were all unique, starting from sweet to savoury.   Pomelo Salad - I love pomelo but I found this dish to be a bit overpowered by fish sauce. Still very good!   Beef boombai - this was fall off the bone delicious and we had it with a side of roti. However, I wish we knew the portion size of the roti as we would've made a second order. It is made to order and we didn't care to wait another 10 mins for another roti to be made.   Drinks- both the 2 Sisters and Pandan Thai ice tea were very good.   Service - great from start to finish.  Ambiance - we were seated beside an obnoxiously loud group who put a damper on an otherwise great dining experience."}
{"text":"REVIEW FOR THEIR BRUNCH ONLY  Service: the waitress was really attentive, friendly, and helpful with suggestions, and explained every dish we order when she brought them to us!  Drink: we ordered the Ka Jiab Iced Tea (hibiscus) - a bit of sweet and sourness, very refreshing for a warm day!  Food: we came here for their recently offered brunch, and ordered their Chor Ladda (also available during dinner), Eggs Benedict, and Thai Rice Congee  Chor Ladda - MUST MUST MUST TRY! It was such a BEAUTIFUL LOOKING ANDDD UNIQUE AND DELICIOUS DISH! It's light, sweet, savoury, and chewy, is definitely order this again in the future!  Eggs Benedict - portion is larger than most eggs Benedict I've seen! It's stacked really tall with Thai fried cruller, fried basa fish, eggs, topped with a unique spicy Thai style hollandaise, and comes with a side of salad. It's different and worth a try if you love eggs Benedict!  Thai Rice Congee - it seems to be chicken based and comes with many toppings and crispy rice noodles. You can eat everything separately or mix up all the ingredients (I recommend) for the full flavour. It's a great choice if you are looking for something light and hearty!  Overall: if you are tired of the common American/Canadian/European brunch dishes Toronto has to offer, come here for a new experience on the taste bud! I would definitely go back again to try other dishes they have to offer!"}
{"text":"My favourite Thai place so far. It's not the ordinary Thai food like pad Thai and stuff. They actually put some thoughts into the food creativity, plating and decorations.... flavour is as good as it looks. :) Will go back and try more next time."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  I took my hunni here for a cute little dinner date a while back and we loved it here.  FIRST I HAVE TO TELL YOU GUYS TO NOT BOOK ON OPEN TABLE. BECAUSE I ENDED UP BOOKING THE ONE IN NEW YORK. so please BOOK ON YELP  Anyways, the food was so good. The aesthetic is extremely on point and really really beautiful. Every single dish is carefully hand crafted. From their royal dumpling platter with natural colours and exuberant flavour ranging from sweet to savoury to their extra tender Gaeng boombai naeng, every plate was perfect.   The service here is polite, friendly and attentive. They give great recommendations and are very genuine and take great care of you.   Easily one of my most memorable meals with my honey!"}
{"text":"Kiin is not your average Thai cuisine - it is wonderfully more upscale and the dishes are definitely much more high end than the typical Thai offerings elsewhere.  When I heard Kiin was opened by the same people who run Pai, Sabai Sabai and Sukothai, I had really high expectation as those are some of my favourite places. I was not disappointed!  For my first visit, I started my meal with a delightful Royal Thai platter, consisting of 4 delicious and delicate looking Thai dumplings. The platter starts with dumplings on the sweeter side and you work your way to the savoury one. Even though some would say it is quite small for a $12 dish, I thought it was perfectly reasonable considering how great it tasted and how much work it must have taken to make these delicate morsels.  The pork jowl was another wonderful and tasty dish - I simply love the meat texture, and the flavour was incredible. Thai kale stalks are provided on ice as a palate cleanser between bites, and they were wonderfully crunchy. Yum!  My first meal was so good, I decided to go back with some friends a week later! We ordered some bigger dishes this time. Most notable was the Khao Yum, which probably is one of the most pretty salads you'll see. It's got different coloured jasmine rice mixed with lemongrass, long beans, coriander, lime leaves, pomelo, sprouts, edible flowers and tamarind-soy sauce. A great sharing dish!  The Yum Tua Plu (wing bean salad with chili shrimp paste) was wonderful also, and I love the crunchiness of the wine bean.  The braised short rib was fall off the bone tender and the sauce was super tasty. I would highly recommend it as well.  The only miss for us was the sea salt-crusted sea bream. Even though the fish itself was cooked perfectly (not dry), we thought it was a bit gimmicky and most of the flavour was from the provided Kale leave and sauce mix. A bit pricey at $32 IMO.  Overall, I really loved Kiin and I look forward to seeing what other dishes they might come up with next if they ever refresh their menu."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing. Each dumpling melted in my mouth full of flavor and style. The pork dish was cooked to perfection and the flavor profile was top notch. As an out of owner this was a great first dinner."}
{"text":"I visited Kiin's lunch service on a Wednesday. I was able to get a seat at the bar without wait.   The menu is pretty simple; you build your own noodle soup, or pick among the rice dishes. I ordered a Ma Naew (spicy, sour and peanut soup) with Sen Buk, BBQ pork.   The service was friendly and the waitress gave me some good recommendation. It was a little wait for my noodle soup to arrive, but I could tell the reason because they made the soup and noodle fresh.   The wait was totally worth it because the Ma Naew soup was very aromatic and well balanced between the spicy and sour flavourful. I drank it all at the end. The BBQ pork was tender and juicy. The lady next to me ordered the Yen Tao Fo with Sen Yai (flat rice noodle) was so aromatic and looked very tasty. I will order it next time.   In conclusion, Chef Nuit never disappoints. Although the price point ($14) is a little high for a bowl of noodle soup, the quality is worth that price point.   And the restaurant decor is so beautiful and classy. It will be a perfect for lunch / dinner dates."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend and we were not disappointed! Made a reservation 2 weeks in advance for a Tuesday night. It's not possible to walk in without waiting in line.   Pros: unique and upscale Thai dishes, elegant interior design and decor, fantastic cocktail menu and friendly staff.  Cons: took forever for food to come, had to wait 20 minutes even though we had a reservation, food is very pricey and very small-portioned.   I would come back again only for special occasions. It is not your average Thai food and I would absolutely come back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars for brunch and dinner... I'd easily say one of the top places for Thai food in the city and a great place for dining in general.    There's a new player in the brunch game and it is really really good.  I love when a place takes your typical regular brunch dishes and turn it upside on its head with a new creative take.  Kiin does that with a Thai flare.  Ive been here for dinner and loved it.  Brunch is no different.  It's a gorgeous light setting ... it feels relaxed but also regal at the same time.  It helps to see the Thai royal family portraits on the back wall to help emphasize that elevated experience.  The light woods and golden tones all speak to a warmer and zen like experience.  Tables here are well spaced out.  You're not going to knock over the next table dishes if you try to move out of the comfy banquette that lines the wall.    Service reflects the same warmth you see in place.  It's friendly, outgoing but not in your face, thoughtful, and considerate.  Our server was spot on all the recommendations and able to explain every dish you've never tried.  Which on this menu is a lot... this is not your grandma's brunch menu or any Thai menu you've seen before.  It takes your standard brunch dishes throw in the Thai flavours and tropical fruits that makes it stand out.  Instead of typical donuts, you have Thai Cruller with Pandan custard.  Granola... sure but with lychee and mango.  Benedicts are here but with Thai cruller, fried basa fish, and Thai hollandaise.  Chor Ladda (Jasmine rice dumplings) - This is a mainstay on their dinner menu.  These beautifully folded flower looking in a gorgeous shade of lapis.  The colour cames naturally from a local Thai flower.  These are just the perfect bite of flavour.  Inside you have sweet coconut meat and savoury peanuts.  It's topped with crispy onions that firmly veers the dumpling into a bold savoury burst.  You get 6 in the appetizer size. Be ready to fight for the last one. 4.5/5  Crispy Thai Omelette - So I came thinking French omelette... so wrong of me.  Rethink this as a deconstructed fried rice ... fluffly and tender black rice (berry rice) and jasmine rice are the foundation to a huge mound of chicken pieces and deep fried egg droplets that are crispy bites.  Cooked onions and red peppers add to the flavour ... then it's topped with your Sriracha for that sweet heat we all know.  Mix it up and you got a huge plate of a good fried rice.   4/5  Coconut Waffles - Gluten Free... yup, it's made with rice flour instead.  You may not notice because it's just as light as the ones made with wheat.  With the very generous waffles, you also get sweet juicy mango pieces, white dragonfruit, red dragonfruit, and the most delicious potent coconut cream to dip everything in.  I think I could have drizzled that on top of pancakes, donuts, pound cake... you get the idea.  4.5/5  Loved this experience as it's not your everyday brunch ... food is delicious and the service is spot on.  I really couldnt ask for a better way to start my Sunday.  Another perk... they take reservations so go call!"}
{"text":"A delightful experience in royal Thai cuisine from the owners of Pai! Made a reservation for 6 people on a weeknight and got the best spot by the porch - the renovated underground space was bright and airy with some nostalgic touches. I recommend coming in a big group to try as much as possible without totally breaking the bank. We shared and enjoyed all of these: - Royal Thai ($12) x 3 - Kang Moo Yang Nam Jim / pork jowl ($15) - Khao Yum / rice dish ($24) - Mieng Pla / sea bream ($32) - Gaeng Boombai Nua / short rib ($28)  While not as filling as casual Thai dishes, the flavours and presentation were way more subtle and refined so it was a very pleasant treat. Pandan Thai Iced Teas were beautiful and delicious as well. Service was informative, helpful and fast. Though it's out of my average dining budget, Kiin was definitely a special experience and I would be back for an occasion."}
{"text":"Believe the hype!  Kiin will very quickly become the most desired Thai restaurant in Toronto, so I would book a table while there is still a chance. Aside from the delicious food, everything from the service to the presentation was on point and made this one of the best dining experiences I have had in Toronto. From the small plates, we started with the Roy Thai which is an assembly of delicate dumplings almost too beautiful to eat and packed with intense flavour. This is a must try but good luck deciding who will get to eat which dumpling! The muscles are the best I've had in Toronto and are accompanied by a delicious lemongrass / kaffir lime sauce. The Yum Tua Plu (wing beans in chilli sauce) were both delicious and spicy but perhaps not for those afraid of a little kick. If I had to skip one item on the small plate list, it would be the Kang Moo Yang Nam Jim Jaew (aka grilled pork).   From the large plates we tried the Khao Yum which is the very colourful vegan rice salad that is mixed at the table. While this dish was a feast for the eyes, my palate did not find it too interesting. On the other hand, Gaeng Boombai (braised short rib with tamarind) was an absolutely divine dish that I would highly recommend.   Overall, this would be my go to Thai restaurant if it does not end up being booked weeks in advance. Pro tip: you can order the specialty hibiscus tea with a shot of liquor."}
{"text":"Made a reservation on a weekday night.  We were greeted and seated right away.  All the dishes we ordered were recommended by the server.  Royal Dumpling Platter- the portion is TINY. The only thing I liked from the 4 is the one with peanuts. Rest were just meh. Looks nice though :)  Pork Jowl- Unique dish. There is a bit of a sourness due to the fish sauce. Overall 4/5  Khao Yum- This is a vegetarian dish. I'm a meat-lover but ordered it due to the hype. Honestly, it wasn't for me. There was a lot of unique flavours, but no wow factor here.   Beef Wellington - The best dish from all! Beef is very tender and just falls off of the bone. Marinated in Thai curry sauce. I loved it :)  We got the 2 Thai cocktails (forgot the name) and was so amazing!!  Over-priced for the small portions., and nothing really blew my mind.   Mosty likely I would not return, but now I can say I tried it!"}
{"text":"On the one hand, Kiin hits some high notes with elegant decor, and outstanding food presentation and silverware. On the other hand, Kiin hits some low notes with mediocre flavours and sky-high prices for very little food. If you're on a first date, this would be a nice place to go, so long as you're willing to splurge. If you're looking for a hearty dinner, this place is not your ticket. It's almost the complete opposite of what Thai food is intended to be - simple food, with big flavours. Anthony Bourdain must be rolling in his grave (I hope it's not too early for this sort of joke, for I truly do admire Anthony Bourdain, may he rest in peace!)  Here's what we ordered:  Royal Dumpling Platter: Price: $12 (for 4 little dumplings) Presentation: 5/5 Flavour: 2/5 Value: 1/5 This plate was a huge flop. On the one hand it is a stunningly beautiful dish. On the other had, the flavours are sweet on sweet with some more sweet. It had very little flavour otherwise, with no balance whatsoever. This is NOT authentic Thai cuisine which is all about balancing sweet, sour and spicy. Plus, at $12 for four little dumplings, you are not getting a bang for your buck. If you're trying to impress a lovely lady, it might be a good dish. Flavour-wise, you're not getting much more than you would out of edible flours.   Chor ladda: Price: $12 Presentation: 4/5 Flavour: 1/5 Value: 2/5 These bright blue jasmine rice dumplings are no improvement on the previous dish. They are beautiful, and have a pleasant texture, but no discernible flavour any more than plane rice. Please enjoy.   Mixed rice salad (vegan): Price: $24 Presentation: 5/5 Flavour: 2/5 Value: 2/5 This plate is just a little better than the previous two. On the one hand, it is again a stunningly beautiful dish. It has many components, and come deconstructed in such a way that it looks like a painter's colour palate with many bright colours. It's served in a gorgeous metal bowl. But once the server mixes it, and you taste it, it's quite bland. No flavours, no textures, not much of anything.   Pandan Chicken: Presentation: 2/5 Flavour: 2/5 This dish again was a big flop. It's a tiny little piece of chicken which was marinated for far too long (resulting in very strong, almost unpleasant chicken flavour.) It was wrapped in Pandan leaf. We were told we could eat the leaf. I tried. Big mistake! I had a mouthful of inedible straw which I had to elegantly extract from my mouth in a rather posh restaurant... teehee.   Chicken Stir Fry: Price: $26 Presentation: 3/5 Flavour: 4/5 Value: 3/5 This was the most successful dish of the evening. The chicken was covered in a thick gravy of lemongrass and ginger. The lemongrass was very cleverly pureed to a pulp and that made it edible, with nice flavours.  It was great beautiful dish, albeit small.  The absolutely best thing served was the fried bread accompaniment to the mains. It was deep fried goodness - absolutely divine.  Drinks are - what can I say? - downtown prices. A cocktail would set you back $15; Hardly a good value in my books. A beer would set you back about $8.   An important thing to keep in mind is the following: Many restaurants these days opt for small plates, and Kiin is no exception. It's not a bad idea, since you get to sample different dishes. However, they get away with charging high prices, without you noticing. Case and point: Yelp says that this restaurant is in the $$$ category, but it most definitely belongs in the $$$$ category. The number of dishes you would have to order in order to be satiated would easily put you in the $150 range for a dinner for two."}
{"text":"Everything at Kiin was aesthetically pleasing - Every dish was vibrant and interesting. Flavours were light, refreshing, and often with a nice spice factor.  Starting with Thai Iced Teas, $6 - Tried the Pandan (meh) and the Matoom (enjoyed this, tastes like banana leaves).   Roy Thai, $16 - Must. Order. Four kinds of distinctive 'dumplings' - each with its own flair.    Khao Yum, $24 - Brimming with a multitude of herbs, spices, and ingredients. Super fresh and had a good kick to it.  Mieng Pla, $36 - Tasty and well portioned sea bream wraps that played on different textures.    Highly enjoyed the modern, experimental Thai food experience and would come again to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant I've ever been to!! Every dish was so unique and tasted DELICIOUS. The Thai iced tea is a must.. not too sweet and sugary, tasted perfect. Food took awhile to come out but it was so worth the wait. I waited one month to get reservations at this place, book early & go hungry! Can't wait to go back & try all the other dishes :) one of our favourites is the wing bean salad"}
{"text":"The waiter was very rude. Before I finished my meal, the waiter kept cleaning the table WHILE I was eating. The food was salty. I don't feel welcomed at all at this restaurant. I will definitely NOT come back again."}
{"text":"It was my first visit to Kiin (after it took over the former Khao San Road location). I was reluctant to try this place, as the menu only offered shared entrees, but today when we went at lunch, they had single portions. The menu selection was quite limited and had either make-your-own noodle soup or some sort of curry with jasmine rice - I was disappointed that pad thai wasn't on the menu.  We got to the restaurant at noon on a Tuesday, and even with a larger group of 8, we were seated right away (back when it was Khao San Road, there was no way we would be seated without having to wait). The decor/renovation was exception and modern, though the bathroom stalls were small. Half the people in our group ordered the fried chicken with rice, served with a small dish of red curry. I went with a noodle soup, where I got to select the type of noodle, soup base (I went with Tom Yum) and a protein (I went with grilled chicken, but you can also choose beef, bbq pork). My noodle soup portion was fair, and tom yum soup was delicious - with all the right spices and fresh herbs (cilantro, coriander, green onion). At $14, the order is comparable to other lunch dishes in the entertainment district. Service was quick and the staff was attentive. By the time we left at 1:00, the restaurant still wasn't full, nor was there a wait. With Khao San Road close by, I think we'll go back there next time."}
{"text":"The highly anticipated opening of Chef Nuit and Jeff Regular's latest restaurant, Kiin, is finally here! Kiin, Thai for \"eat\" will truly bring the taste of Thailand to Toronto. The duo behind Sabai Sabai, Pai and Sukhothai have shifted from their Northern Thai food focus to introduce a variety of traditional Thai dishes that can be found all over Thailand.  Chef Nuit  says that the menu draws from experiences she's had growing up and travelling across Thailand where food sharing is an important part of the culture.  A few of the dishes on the menu also take inspiration from Royal Thai cuisine which is pretty much extinct in Thailand.  However, Chef Nuit learned many of the techniques while in Thailand which attribute to very intricate, delicate and beautifully prepared dishes.  The menu features a mix of local and imported ingredients, allowing guests to experience the different flavours of Thailand. Ingredients such as white turmeric, buffalo basil, wing beans and angled gourd are just a few of the unique additions to Chef Nuit's creations.  My favourite dishes were the Royal Thai Platter, Wing Beans, Braised Short Rib and Sea Bream.  However, I really did enjoy every single dish I tried and was super impressed by the different flavours and presentation of the food.   Not only is the food incredible, but the space at Kiin is beautifully designed and intimate, with a capacity of 35.  Whether you're here for lunch or dinner, you'll be truly amazed by every aspect of Kiin.  Kiin will be open for lunch and dinner service and is located at 326 Adelaide Street West. Hours of operation are Monday to Friday from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm for lunch, Monday to Sunday from 5:00 pm to 11:00 pm for dinner."}
{"text":"Kiin, another restaurant started by Chef Nuit.   But this is different from all the other restaurants that she started up. I love the Royal treatment with everything from the decor, the menu and the presentation. Different from other Thai restaurants and definitely a more refined experience.  Reservation is a MUST. And I love the fact that they takes reservation. The place is small and intimate. You might be seated really close to your neighbours.  Menu is constantly changing. I do like trying different dish and this make dining so much more fun.  Highly recommend Kiin for special occasion.   I can't wait to be back to try out their brunch with a Thai twist!"}
{"text":"Good drinks, good service, great decor, nice presentations. Unfortunately the food doesn't match and the value isn't there.   The two of us split the royal Thai platter, pork jowl, khao yum and sea bream. The sea bream and a couple treats on the royal Thai platter were nice but nothing really stood out. Most notable was the khao yum, although it was notable for the price rather than the taste. Yes, it looks pretty but is otherwise just a $24 cup of naturally-colored rice with some herbs mixed in. Maybe there's a lot of labor that goes into it but none of that shows through in the flavour, and there's no way it makes a satisfying main course for anyone. (Well, maybe Kate Moss.)  Perhaps we ordered wrong, but the overriding theme was that none of the dishes we ate had any recognizable spice or funk to them -- aside from the green chili sauce served with the sea bream, you could even call them bland. I'd venture to guess this would've been the case with anything else we could've ordered.  We love Chef Nuit's other restaurants, and recognize this isn't just a noodle and curry spot. But the bottom line is nothing we ate was terribly interesting by any standard. I wouldn't even say Kiin is worth trying.  NB: We didn't order it, but the beef on the menu is not a \"beef wellington\" as so many people here have written, but a beef shortrib from Wellington County. This should be clear from the photos but I feel the need to point out. Even if you've never had beef wellington (which bears no resemblance to a) beef shortrib or b) Thai food) and have no idea what it is, you probably *did* learn how to read at some point in your life."}
{"text":"There's a relatively uncharted niche of Thai cuisine that's landed in Toronto by way of Kiin--Royal Thai. Royal Thai is just what it sounds like. It's opulent. It's elevated. And most importantly, it's delicious.  Kiin, meaning \"eat\" in Thai, is a partnership between Jeff Regular and Nuit Regular, the husband and wife team behind Toronto's rapidly expanding Thai empire (Pai, Sabai Sabai, Sukhothai), and Janet Zuccarini (Gusto 101, Trattoria Nervosa, Pai).  Nuit Regular was raised in Thailand and always dreamed of opening a restaurant where she could share her love of this opulent and less common form of Thai cuisine with others. Through Kiin's menu, she has elevated the Thai staples we have come to know (think: satays, Pad Thai, curries) in an intimate lower-level space that is more mature and refined that its sister restaurants. Kiin incorporates familiar flavours of traditional Thai cuisine (lemongrass, kaffir lime, coconut, coriander) and even imports nearly all of its ingredients from Thailand to perfect the flavour profile of each dish.  Unlike some of the Regular's other restaurants, Thai street food is absent from this menu. Kiin has a sharable, interactive menu that showcases food fit for a king (or a queen in my case...). It's a curation of Royal Thai favourites as well as dishes from Nuit's childhood.  I had the pleasure of meeting the Regulars while I was dining there one evening. For owning a mini empire of restaurants, the couple is humble, gracious and hospitable. Nuit shared a story about how the yum tua plu (wing bean salad) was once a secret recipe that was exclusive to the Thai royal family's staff. She spent several years in culinary school to learn more about her native cuisine and honed the recipes that are now being enjoyed at Kiin.  My guest and I put all of our decisions in the hands of our lovely server, who seemed to have another gig as an actress. Her storytelling was on point and she described each dish with detail as it was presented to us. There were far more standouts than mishaps."}
{"text":"This is such a beautiful place that does some lovely, beautiful and delicious dishes. My friend and I were lucky enough to walk in and get a table on a Friday night, around 6:15. The service here was excellent, as we felt well-attended to the entire time. All of the staff were very friendly and took the time to describe each of the dishes that were presented to us.  We ordered presumably their most popular and/or visually appealing dishes. The Roy Thai platter included four beautifully presented dumplings of varying colours, each with their own unique flavour profiles. I enjoyed the first two (you are supposed to eat them in a specific order) slightly sweet dumplings the most.  The roasted pork jowl was very, very flavourful but perhaps on the touch heavy side. On the one hand, I actually enjoyed the slight bit of heat the dish had - it was not too overwhelming for me. On the other, I did find the dish to be a bit too salty.  The khao yum was our final dish of the night, which featured colourful, naturally dyed piles of rice mixed with lots of vegetables, sprouts, edible flowers and leaves, etc. and presented in a large gold wok. Although the portion seems large, I would caution that it's not actually as filling as you would expect, given the overwhelming ratio of veg to rice.  I also got a pandan iced tea which was again visually stunning with layers of colours. Cocktails seemed a bit pricy.  Definitely a really unique Thai dining experience, as the items on the menu are rarely found elsewhere. I love the opulence of the \"Royal Thai\" dining style and felt like a queen the entire time - I thoroughly enjoyed every second and would love to come back!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been here, but I'll honestly never forget this food! We got the Royal Dumpling Platter to start, which contains 4 unique and different types of dumplings, and I loved the Chor Ladda one so much, I ended up getting the small serving of those as my main. The service was quick, but wasn't very friendly, so four stars for now - hopefully when I come back I'll be able to try (and fall in love with) something else!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Kiin, but this time was for lunch. I decided to order the khao kha moo, not really knowing what it was. It was delicious. The ingredients seem very much inspired by some of the Chinese food I've tried in the past. I mean, just look at those impeccable yu choy! The braised pork was incredible. It was so soft and tender. The five spice broth on top of the rice was delicious. I'm glad that they give you additional broth in a cup because I just poured it all over. The dish comes with pickled mustard greens that I didn't like that much and the sour sauce was very spicy.  I tried the pandan iced tea in the past, so this time I wanted to try something different and ordered the matoom iced tea. It's described as nutty, honey, sweet. It was definitely an interesting flavor. I found it to have a hint of menthol-like flavor. Of the two, I enjoyed the pandan much more."}
{"text":"Great renditions of Thai cuisine infused with Asian influences. Would come here again."}
{"text":"What to try?  Try some mains and some small which are their appetizers. We went past their last call time but they still accommodated us which goes to show how professional they were about their customer service and how much they appreciate their customers. Kiin is still in its soft launch and they told me they just started serving lunch two days ago!! So not that long ago.   We ordered three dishes to share - a main and two small dishes. The main which was the khao yum was the highlight. A vegan dish, it was full of color and flavour. Mixed with soy sauce, the colours of the rice and other ingredients were all blended together in this big gold bowl. Really enjoyed the refreshing taste. We also had pork jowl which is the neck of the pork and was grilled to the texture and taste of my liking. The only thing to be wary about is it's overpowering flavour. It was on the salty side so that's why it might not be a bad idea to also have jasmine rice with this dish as the gai lan that comes with it ( the green vegetable) might not cut it enough to tone down the saltiness of the dish. We also ordered the roy Thai platter which included four different bites that they made in house. All the dishes tasted wonderfully but I have to say it's on the pricier end for the food. A bowl of jasmine rice will cost you $5 so if you're on a budget, I'd say opt for one main and multiple smalls so that you can try a few dishes rather than spend all the money on mains.   Last tip?  They're all shareable styled dishes so ordering dishes to share is the best approach. If you order pork jowl, get a bowl of rice so you can balance the saltiness of the pork dish."}
{"text":"Service was great, the presentation is great. But the portion is so small even for tiny girl like me, I left there hungry. Because they definitely overpriced even the dish tastes not that different from Pai. We ordered masaman curry which was like $24 but you can eat half price at Pai. It came with really small rice, I tried to order more rice but it costed $4 so I was like forget it. I won't complain about the taste though."}
{"text":"My favorite favorite favorite Thai place. Unlike most Thai places, where you feel guilty after eating, this place makes you feel healthy after eating. They have a lovely lunch menu, love trying a variety of noodle soup, if you feel adventures, you should try their blood noodle soup, amazing, super rich flavors. Love love love their dinner menu as well, if you have to get one dish, you should get the fly bean salad, to die for."}
{"text":"2.5. Nope not seeing it. Maybe all the initial hype inflated my hopes for this place.  Pros: - great decor, love what they did to this place. Light and airy and classy and can also be comfortable and not pretentious.  - staff was friendly, maybe over explained some dishes but friendly and helpful with suggestions, though they are still fairly new.  - that braised beef dish. Though with the peanut sauce it seemed to need a bit more of a punch, my bf asked for some of the shrimp paste on the side and that helped.  - Thank you for the complimentary fruit for my friends bday...  Cons: - for all the hype and talk of amazing tasting food, it was good but not amazing.  - for one to actually taste a dish and get the full flavor of it all, I would expect more than just one bite. You need at least a couple bites to understand what kind of gastronomy they are trying to convey. Their \"big seller\" and greatly reviewed dumplings were pretty sub par. For the amount you pay for each dumpling that was only the size of one bite? Sorry - missed the flavors there. Even if we had 3 times as much so we would have more bites, for me, I do not think it was worth it.  - whollyyyyyy long wait!! We spent about 3 - 3.5 hours there. I understand this is not fast food and that is not what I expected. But have you eaten a meal with a couple bites for one dish then LONG wait then a couple more bites then LONG wait then more bites... and with just being good not amazing... it could really put you to sleep if you had no where to go or drive you insane if you do have somewhere to go.  The kicker was that I specifically told them I was bringing my bf there for his bday and they said they would give a complimentary fruit dish. I was trying to be discreet about it so there was no way I could go up to the wait staff and ask about it without giving it away. So we waited and waited awkwardly until I just asked for the bill since I thought they forgot and it was complimentary anyways so could do without it. Only then did they say oh well we still have  the dessert fruit platter coming. So I paid the bill and we waited for the fruit. At this point we had to get going because it was getting late. .......................from that time it was 30+ minutes More and lots of parking payment top ups later!!! Only until I asked that the fruit be put into a take out container did they hurry it up. Took us two minutes to eat the fruit. FRuit! 30+ minutes to cut fruit? I don't get it. Were they waiting for it to ripen? Did they grow it in their back yard just for this? They had quite a few servers and the servers too. That just topped off the night.   Overall the food is good. Don't get me wrong. Not amazing as the reviews say. And the slowness of the service made me want to pull my hair out! They were friendly and nice though. Maybe it was an off night for them.  Unfortunately I would not go back. Nor would suggest it to anyone. Unfortunately because I had high hopes because of all the reviews, the disappointment is that much more since it was for my bfs bday."}
{"text":"Everything here was so yummy. The prices are reasonable for food but the cocktails are quite expensive. Between me and my bf we had no apps, just 2 entrees and 3 drinks. Bill came to $110.  I had the beef and he the chicken stir fry. Both tasted great, but the chicken definitely needed rice which it didn't come with, or it would be too thick and salty. The beef was so tender and I would order it again. The sauces are quite rich and heavy so it fills you up. I had the moscow m cocktail and it is now my favorite drink, a must try!  I added some other photos of what my friends had but will not be reviewing those items."}
{"text":"A standout Thai restaurant purposefully different from what we've come to expect of Thai food in Toronto, Kiin serves up dishes good enough for royalty...Literally! As explained by our waitress, the food and method of cooking are drawn from Royal Thai style cuisine. As you would serve royalty, dishes are prepared with utmost patience and intention. Some menu items are handmade as ordered and dyed with natural foods like turmeric, butterfly-pea flower, and beets. The foods aesthetic is only matched by the imported dishware it's plated on...I actually gasped when I saw the dish the Khao Yum was served in.  Food recommendations: Royal Thai Platter, and vegetarian friendly menu items Chor Ladda (handmade jasmine rice flour dumplings), Khao Yum (rice salad). Finally, a special shout out to the Thai fruit platter including Rambutan and Mangosteen. These fruits are imported directly from Thailand but due to seasonality they don't offer this year round.  This isn't your typical Thai food joint, so the food may taste less flavourful in comparison. I recommend going in with an open mind as it is a great place to check out if you want to experience a unique branch of the same cuisine."}
{"text":"Came here with a few girlfriends for dinner. We had a great time! The food was delicious, service was fantastic, and we liked the vibe of the restaurant.   Must orders: - royal dumpling platter - sea bream  - wing bean salad - khao yum (I personally didn't love all of the flavours but my friends did and it's insta worthy!)  The food:  - royal dumpling platter was one of our favourite dishes! Each dumpling is made with love. So much flavour and so beautifully designed! It comes with 8 dumplings (2 of each). You eat them in a specific order - from sweet to savoury. I wanted to order another! - we had a vegetarian in our party so ordered this other dumpling dish (purple dumplings - they come in the royal dumpling platter). - wing bean salad comes with soft boiled duck eggs. Tasted like crunchy okra with a spicy sauce. My friends really liked this dish.  - khao yum is the pretty rice dish that you see all over Instagram. It's definitely picture worthy and is made with 14 ingredients. It's both colourful and flavourful. I personally thought it was too lemongrass-y and flower-y but my friends were fans.  - sea bream was another favourite dish. The fish was very fresh and soft. This dish came with lettuce wraps and a refreshing lime sauce.  - the mussels were good. Sauce was flavourful and it came with a decent amount.  - dessert was a fruit plate. I think they're working to expand their dessert menu. I personally wouldn't recommend ordering this. $15 for a few pieces of fruit.   The space: Interior has been beautifully redecorated. The decor is classy and modern. Washrooms are a little small.   The service: Very attentive wait staff! Water is always topped up. Servers explain each dish and how to eat it."}
