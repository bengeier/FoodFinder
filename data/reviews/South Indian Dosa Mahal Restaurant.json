{"text":"Pros: Wholesome South Indian food made with care and a home cook feel. Everything is vegetarian (but not lacking in flavor). Star attractions are the Chili Cheese Dhosa, the Scrambled Egg, and the renowned Dhosa Mahal. The chutneys are scrumptious. They also sell some quite tasty samosas and pakoras near the entrance (three or four for a buck I think; affordable for any budget). 

The restaurant is family run and you get a genuine sense that they see their customers as people. 

Cons: The Landsdowne neighborhood is a bit rough. Be warned, this restaurant is far from fancy, very humble decor etc. Just saying if that's an issue"}
{"text":"Finally made it to this beautiful pink palace of warm spices and friendly service. What a treat! 

As soon as we sat down we were brought a beautiful pink pitcher of water and a set of metal cups. 

The longer I sat here the more I realized there just is not enough pink in my life.

I had the vegetable dosa - light as air dosa and lovely flavours in the accompanying eggplant, potato and cauliflower fillings (3 separate). I do not enjoy super-caliente food and found the level of spiciness quite perfect for me.

One friend had goat curry. The other had roti and fish curry with roti and rice (can't remember what exactly things were called on the menu). They both raved about the deliciousness of everything.

We tried a samosa and one of us exclaimed - \"This is the best samosa I have ever had!\"

And, as everyone has mentioned, the prices are amazing. 

No liquor license but they have nice juices and lassi. 

Go there. You will have FUN!"}
{"text":"The Mysore Dosa plate is highly recommended. My friend and I had lunch here yesterday--I ordered the biryani combo (vegetarian), which was tasty. My friend got the Mysore Dosa combo (or something like that--or was it Madras? My brain says Mysore. It was one of the spicy selections.)--which was absolutley fabulous. There were many of the same items offered, but the Mysore dosa plate presented more options and larger sizes (it was done South Indian style, as a thali, in which there are portions of a wide variety of dishes provided in separate containers or compartments on a plate). We ended up sharing our plates, and everything was delicious.

Definitely stop by. We also purchased some of the fried takeout items. They looked good, but some of them were a bit dry on their own--I hadn't thought to get sauces for any of them. They were fine, but not the highlight of this spot! Go for the dosa!!

Also, though my biriyani plate was supposedly medium spice, it wasn't that spicy, where the Mysore dosa thali had a decent kick to it, but did not obscure the delicious flavours of the dishes (I don't like too spicy, because then the spice is all you taste--this wasn't the case, here)."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and never disappointed. I usually order vegetarian biryani and sometimes take out their tasty lunchboxes. Service is fast and courteous."}
{"text":"This place first caught my eye when the sign in the window advertised 3 samosas for $1 or 10 for $3. These samosas are addictive especially if paired with their tomato chutney ($1.25).

Although I mostly go there to pick up a few items to take away, I have eaten there a few times. The dosa here is delicious though sometimes can be on the salty side.

Meat eaters should be warned, recently the restaurant converted to a vegetarian / vegan restaurant."}
{"text":"Found this place just searching for South Indian restaurants and thought of giving it a try after almost 1 month moving to Toronto. I got their Veg meal including 3 curries for $10 (incl tax). The parathas were made with maida rather than whole wheat which became rubbery by the time back home. The taste of curry also not that great. More over the menu on yelp seem to be outdated. They've removed quite few options in restaurant and change the price of few. I don't think I will visit them again."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years, and it is my favourite place for dosas in Toronto! Easy access via the TTC, which, given how good the dosas are at SIDMR, makes the trek from downtown to Gerrard Street not worth it. You can do just as well here.

The dosas are wonderful, the curries perfectly flavourful, and the service exceptionally friendly. Like other small restaurants in Toronto it has the feel of eating in someone's house, which is a nice thing here since the staff is very pleasant. The bright pink paint is really cheerful making it a place that I like to come when I'm feeling down or stressed. But it is the food that is so wonderful -- we've tried many different kinds of dosas and have enjoyed them all.

Also, since the remodel last summer, the traffic flow between the take-out counter and the restaurant is better, making the eat-in dining experience more pleasant than before."}
{"text":"Even though it only takes like 2 minutes for their paper takeout bags to become transparent with grease, the 10 samosas for $3 is just an irresistible deal. Add some spicy samosas and a couple pakoras and you have an instant party platter. I've eaten sit down twice and got the \"metal tray full of stuff\" plates, but still haven't quite found a dish with all things that I like the taste of. Love this place regardless. One day I'm going to get the 100 samosas and just give them out to everyone I see in the street to celebrate the glory that is South India and the glory that is Bloor Street."}
{"text":"Have been to this great veggie restaurant several times over the years and it never disappoints.

Friendly, down go earth service.

Great value.

Thailis, dosa, all great!

Excellent for my kids too!"}
{"text":"Great place. Great food. In Toronto, I was missing South Indian fare very much. This place got me covered for all my cravings. The people are friendly, warm and kind. The service is great too. Would surely recommend for anyone who wants to eat South Indian food. Its a \"ToGo\" place for the same in Downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"3-3.5. Tasty and cheap. Great dosa and light vegi masala. Lots of good fried take outs eg. Samosa and little coconut donuts. Not much service but as expected."}
{"text":"If you want to enjoy South Indian food in a family restaurant with a whole lotta heart, this is a good place to go. SIDHR is run by loving people who can have my money any day.

The decor is whacky and whimsical (the children decorate the restaurant and their loving parents leave the decorations up), the food is inexepensive and plentiful, and the service is friendly. (The service is \"laid back\" so if you are in a rush, you may want to consider a day in which you can take your time to savour this place).

They recently went completely vegetarian which is fanatastic.

Love the veggie paratha meal. The samosas (10 for $3) are AMAZING! A great place to take your friends if any of them have a tight budget and want a great meal from scratch."}
{"text":"Great for many important reasons - most noteabley authenticity and price.  

For well under $20 you can get a full dinner and an entire day's worth of samoas, vidai's, mango balls, spinach rolls ect.

Owners are incredibly kind and helpful in this family run establishment.  Many dishes heavily spiced. 

There is great value and great authentic interesting food here.  Its not fancy but is such a refreshing change to the butter chicken/channa marsala type-places that are everywhere."}
{"text":"South Indian Dosa Mahal is one of the best places for vegetarian Indian food at a reasonable price in Toronto. Their menu includes dosa, a rare offering in most Indian restaurants,  and thali, which offers a variety of dishes for the same price as one in other establishments. I've been coming here since discovering it in 2004 and followed them to their new location down the street. Naomi the owner always greets me with a smile and kind words. We've watched each other's children grow up and she's still questioning why I haven't married my partner yet!! I love her eggplant curry and the potato dish. The samosas could do with a few peas, and less salt all around, but it is still one of my first choices for Indian food in Toronto."}
{"text":"Look, at the end of the day, there has to be *some* place in the universe that is the best place, right? What are the odds that it's in Toronto, or that it's even on planet Earth? Okay, probably pretty slim. But what are the odds that it serves dosa? Very, very high. Necessary, I'd say. This fact makes South Indian Dosa Mahal, at the very least, in the *running* for the title of \"Best Place in the Universe\". You can't refute this logic.

My first few times, I was a little overwhelmed by the menu, but it's pretty simple once you see the patterns. The main question is \"What kind of bread do you want to go along with your curried potato, curried eggplant, delicious sambar, two kinds of coconut chutney, and rotating third curry item?\" Your possible answers being: Roti, chapati, idli, dosa, dosa, dosa, dosa, dosa. Many kinds of dosa. Honestly, negligible difference between them, but I say that as someone who's relatively new to the world of dosa.

Sambar idli makes a great app. Pretty much anything on the menu named \"______ vegetable masala dosa\" is a winner. Dip that dosa into everything, bro.

I'm a diner that loves variety, and that's exactly what you get on every tray of food served at SIDM (that's what we're calling it now). Mains are all about 7-8 bucks. The takeout is dirt-cheap, but it lacks the certain je-ne-sais-dosa of a dosa. Unless you get it with a dosa.

The decor needs lots of help, but I don't take stars away for such trivial things when the food I so crave is served up, on demand, day after day (except Sunday).

So, okay, probably not *the* best place in the universe, but *maybe*, just *maybe*, this is what will put Toronto on the Intergalactic map. No way they got dosa like this anywhere on backwards, hillbilly Saturn."}
{"text":"The tale of two SIDMRs.  Yup- if they have the vrashan to give a little restaurant on Bloor West a five word name, then I'm going to do the proper thing and reduce them to an acronym.  This is not about acrimony; I'm a professional.

The first SIDMR is the snack counter up front.  It's just not that good.  There are all foods that I normally enjoy - and let's not kid each other - I am not the type of man who shies away from a bulk snack deal.  But still... no.  After the first bite of a pakora I spontaneously Yelped out a mini review \"Wow! They fried the cheap right into these puppies\"  Uh huh - they're so cheap because - wait for it - they're so cheaply made.  My dining companion and I mused as to the primary ingredient - she said sawdust, I said recycled yellow pages (cuts down on the turmeric expense...)

SIDMR was firmly ensconced in the write off pile at this point. Until fate intervened and I was compelled to visit again at the best of a vegan friend (NOT my BVF) We were in the neighborhood, she was hungry, saw the word vegan and - poof - in we went.

The non-Industrial \"restaurant-styled\" restaurant in the back actually churns out some decent South Indian food!  The Dosa veggie thali is worth a shot - with a major caveat.  Their sambar is as generic as possible while still retaining a whiff of hope that the person who programmed the machine that spat it out ever flew over the Indian sub-continent.  The curries that come with thali were actually all quite good.  The tomato coconut chutney redeemed them a bit in the condiment.  Since I was with a VF I did not consume any of the animal protein offerings; respect, yo!

The rating was a toughie for me; Do restaurants get better with age? Rarely.  As the Blandsdowne market gets more competitive, my belief is that SIDMR will have to either up their game or up and go.  So my 3 star rating represents my belief in market forces and/or Darwin."}
{"text":"I finally got to dine here! A friend took me for dinner here and the menu was pretty extensive. 

I wasn't that hungry so we got some somosas and the vegetable biryani. The somosas were great as usual. What really blew me away was the veg biryani. It came with the standard rice and veg, but had some sides (thali?) with it. The rice was also nicely cooked, spiced and not too greasy. It was well presented and tasted awesome!"}
{"text":"Edit: the service has improved significantly so I am giving two more stars.

Three stars, but would be five if service wasn't so bad. The place is biased in favour of takeout customers. Basically all the food on the takeout menu is much cheaper, and when you sit down to have a meal you wait ages for someone to acknowledge you (hint: the one server is busy with takeout customers). When you finally get to place your order you discover the giant discrepancy in the dine-in price vs takeout. I would think that since dining in is more expensive, they would at least be attentive, but nope. Your food arrives (sometimes in a timely fashion and sometimes it takes ages) and you are effectively ignored after that. But it is delicious. You forget all your troubles as the wonderful, perfectly spiced curries invigorate your taste buds. Which is why we go back time and again. The food is perfect. Rotis and chapatis are good, but the dosa is the best in Toronto (outside of Scarberia). Generous portions make it a good value, even if it's cheaper to grab it in a takeout container."}
{"text":"For the price, this place is hard to beat.
If you ever need to bring appetizers to a party, this is the place.
Homemade appetizers...samosas of many kinds...25 pieces for $10!
As for the food, I always get the same dish...the vegan takeout meal.
It's delicious every time. And the staff are very friendly. It seems to be a Mother
And daughter front run store. They are always nice and helpful.
I always try to get lunch here when in the area."}
{"text":"This place is a vegetarian, gluten-free Indian wonderland.  I've been eating here for many years, and I never tire of the crispy dosas and the mild South Indian curries.

It's family run, and a very casual, laid-back atmosphere.  Prices are super low, and there is a glass case at the front with loads of yummy stuff to grab as take away."}
{"text":"What a great little indian place. Have lived near here for so long and it's been a staple in my life for the past 4 years. Incredible meal/dinner deals to take out or to sit in. So cheap. Amazing vegan options. The mango lassi may not be traditional but on a hot summer day who could go wrong with a $1 ice cold mango drink? Worth checking out if you like indian food and are trying to save some coin! My favourite are the dollar deals, the chutney is amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurants several times last year and once this year. Have tried their samosas, mango Lassie, vegetable dosas and puri with meat curry. Excellent food for a quick cheap lunch and the service is ok."}
{"text":"The coconut chutney is the best! I also like the eggplant and tomato curry. They make great samosas and pakoras too."}
{"text":"Pity the people living in the burbs who don't have access to a dosa spot. This is yum in several different south Indian styles, and at a price that will keep you coming back for every variety. Ok, it may not stand up to the best joints in Mississauga, but it's an oasis of Indian goodness at Bloor and Lansdowne. Hideous decor, but my stomach doesn't care. Yum."}
{"text":"We went in morning and food made night before.
Thali was not at all good. \"Dosa Mahal\": Dosa sambhar or chutney... forget them being authentic, it was awful.
Will never visit again and don't recommend it at all"}
{"text":"For the taste and the value there is nothing better that I know of if you are down for some dosa. Friendly staff and delicious food awaits you here."}
{"text":"I went here last Friday with my partner and two friends.  

Although I've read comments describing the decor as nauseating and offensive, I didn't seem to mind it as much as others.  No, it's not pretty, but I'm willing to overlook certain flaws if the food is good.  But the pink is overpowering!  

Food comes out when it is ready; don't expect to be served in a sequence of courses, or that your food will arrive at the same time as your dining companions' dishes.  

As it's a South Indian restaurant, I passed up the samosas in favour of the dosas and other specialties of the region.

My partner and I shared our dishes so we could sample more.  

The idli were delicious and worth the wait.  I couldn't believe my good luck.  Fluffy, moist, bathed in sambar.    I also liked the kottu roti (my partner less so; he thought it was a carb overload, but it tasted authentic).  A nice treat was the tomato-coconut chutney on the thali platter accompanying the dosa. 

But the dosa itself was slightly less thin and lacy than most.  And the accompanying curries and sambars arrived lukewarm, as opposed to hot (in temperature).  In terms of spice level, it was muted, although we had asked for spicy.  

I washed everything down with a well-made mango lassi.  

The restaurant is now completely vegetarian, and is vegan-friendly.  

Avoid the men's washroom at all costs, unless you enjoy mothballs.

Four of us ate amply for $72.00 including tax and a generous tip."}
{"text":"Just tried this place. Got 10 amosas for $3. I loved it felt it was worth the price and the size of it was huge. I'll be going back when I need a samosa fixing downtown.

Have to say the service was alright not great. Except the woman refused to give more napkins when I asked."}
{"text":"I was in the area on a Tuesday night and needed somewhere to grab something quick to eat. Walked in about an hour before close but my food was served hot and quickly nonetheless. I would have liked a little more explanation for the menu items but next time I'll make sure to bring a friend who is a little more savvy when it comes to Indian cuisine. Something that I really liked about this place was their numerous vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options. This place seems to do a lot of take out as well. I'll return if I'm in the area again for sure."}
{"text":"We've been going to this place for almost three years now. About to move out of the neighbourhood so grabbed a final dosa for my husband. He started developing symptoms of food poisoning that evening."}
{"text":"I was with 4 other friends. I do not like a lot of spice hence I enjoyed my meal. 

$8.50 for veggie & meat thali which satisfied me. I love all the little separate compartments on the tray. I ordered a side of the veggie samosas which are out of this world in my opinion, light and flaky and not greasy. I ordered 10 more to go!! 10 for $3!! The coconut & tomoato chutney was $1.25 and delicious. The chipatti was fresh, crisp yet doughy and delicious.. I ordered an extra one. 2 cans of diet coke and one mango juice. Total was $21 and change, great deal in my opinion for all that food! 

One friend didn't find it spicy enough for him. He was disappointed she brought the equivalent to tobassco sauce to him, he then asked for a hot pepper. He took the spicy stuff off of my tray. 

My other 3 friends enjoyed their meal. You must love pink, mauve and anything in between to be able to sit through your meal at this place!! We did find the service to be a bit slow. It was busy and it was the one lady, presumably the wife and their daughter who is too young to be given any real tasks to accomplish. But if you have great company you really don't notice it that much."}
{"text":"Ok I have to start with the fact that the food is awesome and cheap! and for that only I would rate this place as 5+ but the design and the look from outside is terrible and would hardly get a highest mark of 2....
honestly why is it soooo pink and sparkly? so cheesy? it doesn't carry indian spirit.... argh!

but oh the food! I've been to this place many times and will come again just to have the yummy dosas!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and incredibly cheap Indian food. I ordered the Spinach Dosa meal that came with some sides of curry. It tasted alright. It's mostly sauce and a few bits of vegetable. The dishes all tasted quite similar to one another."}
{"text":"Gosh, this place is cute. 
I have to say I love the neon pink and orange theme, colourful sari draped ceilings, and foam hearts on the wall. It kinda makes this place for me, how kitschy and sweet it is. 

I've been getting takeout samosas/pakoras/bhajis from here every once and a while for a few years now. for 3/$1 you pretty much get what you pay for and its simple and doughy and greasy and yummy. But opt for the $1.25 coconut/tomato sauce to dip in and you've really got it made- that stuff is incredibly delicious! I like to pick these treats up for little gatherings at my house where people are drinking before going out. 

Yesterday I decided to meet a friend here and enjoy some food off the menu. It was nice. I had the veg and meat thali and she had a spinach dosa (the dosas and poppadums here are gluten-free, which is wonderful!).

The woman serving us was lovely, an older Indian lady who seems like she probably owns and runs the place. She told me I looked young and insinuated I'd sneaked out of my parents house. It was a pretty funny way to start the meal.. her teasing was totally charming and adorable.

My thali came with a tasty, crisp poppadum, some nice doughy soft naan, and rice along with a few different stews and pickles. I chose goat for the meat and I was very pleased with the fall-apart tender morsels of goat in delicious gravy served in a fair-sized bowl on my thali tray.. except that a few of the pieces were just fat. The vegetable stews that came along with my meal were hot and miss. There was an eggplant and tomato one that had a nice, smoky strong flavour of roasted eggplant that I loved. Another side of yellow lentil daal was boring and runny, under-seasoned even for my somewhat limited palate for daal (I love daal, but 'm not super knowledgeable in indian cooking and I can't wholly say what makes a great daal). Another smoother daal. perhaps made from orange lentils, had a nice flavour of tasted spice and a nice sourness. The mashed-up curry spiced potatoes that came with the dish were also a bit bland, and seemed like they might be samosa filling. The hot pickle and raita were quite nice, and lent a lot of complimenting complexity to the other flavours. 

I became a bit food jealous of my friend's dosa. For one thing, it was incredibly massive. It came with the spinach cooked into it and it came on a thali plate with similar accoutrements to my dish- but better! The curries/sauces were tastier, more complicated curries comprised of more than one or two main ingredients. Eggplant and potato and onion in a yellow curry sauce, some delicious cauliflower curry in a thick tomato sauce, and that fantastic coconut/tomato sauce was served with her order, as well as the potatoes, pickle and daal I had.

I think next time I'll order the namesake dish and revel in the experience.

(On the way out I noticed that they offer a $5 vegan lunch/dinner meal for takeout. I want to try this soon! I will definitely report back when I do)"}
{"text":"I can't speak to their eat-in experience, but O.M.G. 

They have a take-out counter with completely vegan (and gluten free options) pakora, curry pockets, samosas, mango shakes....I am in LOVE. I have been dreaming about the food here for at least a month. I cannot wait to return. Everything is fresh and amazing, the coconut chutney is fantastic with the samosas and curry pockets, and I am going to stop this review here because I am drooling all over my keyboard. I'll be back real soon!"}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I went here to try to find the equivalent to a Dosa place we love in Vancouver. It was alright but not the best. The meat masala dosa is what we had and the chicken was ranchid! The chutneys were good and the dosa was alright. The place Is decorated with very bright colors! It's like being in a giant pink goo puddle."}
{"text":"2 stars for their take out samosas. They have a deal that is like 10 samosas for $3. They are small little samosas and the filling is basically just mashed potatoes, but they are pretty tasty. I often get a bunch of those samosas if I have a potluck at work or something. 

If I was rating just the meals, I would say 1.5 And the service was 0. The woman came over with a menu and I reached out to receive it and she moved it away from my hand and placed it on the far opposite edge of the table. Weird. She did the same thing when she brought my drink, instead of placing it in front of me she deposited it at the far opposite side of the table so I had to reach across for it. Why?? Didn't say anything when she brings the drink either. I asked for a mango lassi and she said they had a \"mango shake\". I ordered that and it was awful. Number one it was room temperature! It tasted like they mixed a little bit of canned mango drink with water and maybe some skim milk or something? Anyway it was totally unpleasant. Later I discovered that this watery, room temperature glass of liquid cost me $4 plus tax. Ignore the other review that says it's $1! The food itself, served on a prison style metal tray was just okay. The portions were not that big compared to a lot of other restaurants and the curries were nothing special. I really didn't think it was a very cheap or amazing deal for $8.50. What makes something a deal is if it is good and inexpensive. If it is kinda crappy and $8.50 it doesn't qualify as a deal. My meal came to over $14 (masala dosa combo and mango \"shake\") . If you go a little but further east on Bloor St you could go to Banjara and get the most amazing delicious huge veggie combo with dessert for less than that! Further, the interior of this restaurant is awful. Weird pink and yellow walls, horrible fluorescent lighting, filthy vinyl chairs, annoying music playing a little too loud. Not good."}
{"text":"I only tried samosas and sweets, so can't say about other plates or meals; but as far as samosas it was disappointing. Maybe my expectation was too high after reading all these reviews? Veg samosa was simply mashed potato with cumin seeds in fried dough. not even a slight hint of peas or anything else. just potatoes. Doesn't even feel 2 for $1 worth.. No."}
{"text":"Don't even bother if you like Indian cuisine.  The place is very cold, so the food gets cold as soon as it's on the table. 
Toilets are dirty, etc. 
I would give it three stars for the food if it wasn't for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I got the Masala Dosa and oh my, it was UH-mazing and totally hit the spot. The portion was perfect and the taste was out of this world. The place has a very homely vibe. I have been craving to go there again and will do if I am in the area.

Good price as well."}
{"text":"I'll be quick on this one, as I think others have summed up Dosa rather well.

The key is to avoid the supremely cheap, fried takeaway options on display at the front of the restaurant.  They are simply not good, as others have noted:  dry, too doughy, kind of old/stale.

The actual menu items are actually very good, which leaves me torn as to how to rate them.  They're pushing a 4 star for their menu, but a 1.5 or 2 star for the $3 / 10 samosas (and similar \"specials\")

Of particular note is that you can order items of the same name off the menu... and they're more expensive.  There's a reason for that:  they're made fresh, and are much higher quality.

So, I'll go with a 3 star rating and bookmark 'em for further review.  If their menu continues to impress -- and I can forget about the mediocre takeaway stuff -- I'll up it to a 4.  Really, they should just flat out stop with the cheapies, as they reflect poorly on an otherwise good restaurant."}
{"text":"It took months for me to finally go in and get some samosas from this place.  What kept me away? There's an indian restaurant up the street on Lansdowne that sells cheeseburgers and a dessert named, \"burfi.\" I bought the burfi, ate the burfi, then barfed the burfi. If you're into syrupy cake balls then you should grab a burfi. 

Anyway, so SIDMR is good.  The food at this place is CHEAP and delicious... if you're into potatoes and curry.  I tried all of the samosas and the pakora.  Thumbs up!  I tried the chutney and didn't care for it tho.  I brought a friend in with me one time and it smelt sooo weird.  It smelled like they were boiling armadillo skins and diesel fuel back there but they were probably just cooking burfi. 

If you like samosas, you should at least try this place out!  If you like gagging then check out the other Indian restaurant that sells the burfis and get two.  Why two? Because you'll bite into the first one and spit it out immediately; but then you wont believe that it was actually THAT heinous and you'll talk yourself into trying a second one (different flavor).  I bought six different burfis that one time, all six were escorted to the dumpster where they were likely rejected by wildlife too."}
{"text":"You can order whole dishes if you're fancy, and they're pretty good, but it's much better to just get a paper bag full of deep fried things for $4 and lay out in a park slamming back pakoras like god and the constitution meant us to. Honestly."}
{"text":"I went for lunch based on reviews. Brocken piece of shit restaurant. Ordered puri thali, two curries had a tons of masala. When i saw the kitchen for quick few seconds it was mess behind. I left my half food as it was horrible taste. 

DO NOT EVEN TRY FOOD HERE"}
{"text":"Based on my love of Dosas, being in the area and positive reviews I decided to give this place a go a short while back. In spite of the garish decor (which you can see from a mile away), I wasn't deterred and looked forward to a finding a great dosa place while I'm in Toronto. Sadly, I'm still going to have to keep looking.

As much as I wanted to like South Indian Dosa Mahal, I found it a tad lacking. I've had dosas and plenty of them and most of the time I'm pretty easy to please. When I ordered a masala dosa and received something that wasn't even assembled, I was pretty upset. Why were the potatoes on the side? If the food was good I'd be okay with it, but it was bland and rather flavorless. Not to mention the fact that the afformentioned decor is retina detaching pink, the prices are average at best and the service is nothing to write home about. So sorry, no special consideration there!

If you're in the area and are really craving South Indian food, I suppose it's really not that bad. But by no means is it worth making the trip for."}
{"text":"I just visited this place yesterday, for the first time, and gotta say it was great! Went for the Mysore Masala Dosa and it was fantastic, especially since it was take out. Definitely a bang for its buck. 

When you enter you first encounter the snacks/apps/quick and easy items. They have a variety of samosas and what not which looked fairly decent. They had a large list of items, and this being a dosa place, lots of dosa. I'd say go with what their specialty is: Dosa. The dosa that I got had a potato and beet filling, was served with a Sambar, which is kinda like a veggie soup and a coconut chutney on the side . Yum! 

I will definitely be making a visit again."}
{"text":"The 4-star rating is in comparison to all the dosa places I've been to. I really liked the food at this place and it is surprisingly one of the best in the city! The chutney was solid, as was the sambar. Loved the ghee roast dosa and since I can't make the trek out to Nilgiri's all the time I will be coming here very often (probably tonight haha)."}
{"text":"Went to this place last night with a friend. We've both heard a lot about how great this place is. We sat down, looked at the menu, and waited for the lady to take our order. The lady didn't even care about us! She kept walking back and forth around the whole store but wasn't even able to approach us? We then decided to do take out because the stuffed roti caught our eye when we walked in. 

When we were at the take out station, the lady was walking back and forth around the store - again! It was raining heavily outside and the sign said that people who did take out were able to eat in the waiting area. Got our food, headed for the waiting area, and the lady stopped us and said that we're not allowed to sit there because she's smarter than us. She said that she gave us a table to sit, and isn't allowing us to sit in the waiting area because we didnt want to sit at the table. My friend and i just looked at eachother with a \"WTF\" type of face. We walked out into the pouring rain and ate our rotis. It was probably one of the saddest meals we've ever had. 

The rotis weren't even that great either. It was cold and hard, and lacked flavour inside. Wasn't even worth it to be eating in the pouring rain.

We went to Thai Green Chili after and still thought about the comment that the lady made. How fucked up was that for someone to say that to us?"}
{"text":"Walked in for lunch. Had the medium vegan curry for $2.50. Was delicious and for a good price. The spices added a nice flavor. It wasn't salty or heavy at all. Filling even for carnivores."}
{"text":"Was here about 3 months back on a Saturday night. The sambhar was stale, the bonda (potato balls) were rock hard. The staff is polite and gave us extra bondas because they were closing soon. But honestly, the food was rank and stale. My friend said the same thing. I'm kinda shocked how this place has a 4 star average. The ambience is also sad. I feel bad saying this because they were polite, but they need to change. I'm not coming here again, that's for sure."}
{"text":"So good and so filling. They also have awesome take out lunch specials and super cheap samosas in large quantities. Yummy! I had the coriander dosa meal and at first thought it wasn't that much food but was greatly mistaken. I was stuffed! This isn't a fancy place but they do food well and take great pride in it."}
{"text":"I'm coming back here again haha. 

Its a great place for vegetarian Indian cuisine served with an authentic flare. I ordered a thali which came with 5 side curries and parathas (flat bread) and it was really filling! The food tasted great and was not too spicy according to me and a Brazilian friend. Overall its an affordable and yummy Indian place, and I will definitely come back again to try their featured dosa. 

I hope this place never changes. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"A mom and pop South Indian place in Blansdowne: it's hard to be objective. The place is all kinds of authentic. The food is tasty, and they have a great selection of South Indian dishes. Don't show up expecting Butter Chicken or Tandoori. If you've been craving a dosa, uthappam, sambar, etc, this is the place to go. (If you're downtown, you'd also have few other options open to you.) My friend had a dosa, while my wife and I had the only Sri Lankan dish on the menu, kottu roti. The kottu roti isn't spicy unless you ask them to make it so -- in which case they'll chop up a bunch of green chilis and toss them in when cooking.  Everything was delicious. The fact everything is wicked-cheap is also a nice plus. The restaurant actually recently moved locations, just down the road, so there is a lot more space than before. The new place is nicer than the old, but it's still  an ugly restaurant. It's definitely not a first date place. No matter, this is a place to come to experience the food."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this gem after living in this neighbourhood for 5 months. I absolutely love this place!! They have some great deals for medu vadas, pakodas and other snacks - 3 for $1 or 10 for $3. South Indian food can't get any more authentic in Toronto. I have had vadas and dosas in Bangalore and this place is as good as some of the snack joints there, though I haven't had a a dosa here yet. I also want to try the mango slushy. I didn't like the ambience but then again it gives a very South Indian feel to the place. You get what you pay for. I can't wait to try out other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"This review is for two things: the samosas and the service.

1. Samosas - as I live in the area, I would often stop by for samosas. Were they the best samosas ever? No. But they were 10 for $3 and big crispy things with a decent filling. A few months ago, they decided to change their recipe. Why, I do not know, as they were pretty decent before. Now they're awful. The shell is almost bread-y and sort of... damp. It might as well be a samosa pizza pocket. Horrified, I asked the woman that works at the counter if this change was going to last forever. Which brings me to my next point...

2. Service - when asked about the old samosa recipe ever making a return, the woman just gave a curt 'no'. I mentioned how much my boyfriend and I loved the old samosas and she just stared at me as if waiting for me to order. This may not seem like a huge service issue, but every time I'm there, I feel a certain coldness from the staff. They've also papered the restaurant with all sorts of \"rules\" (regarding where you can eat your food, bikes leaning against the building, what doors to enter, etc), that are visible from the outside. This may seem like an innocuous detail, but there are so many of these rules now, it drives me crazy. The restaurant didn't use to be like this, so I'm not sure what has happened in the past few months.

Honestly, I walk by this place twice a day and it makes me long for the glory days of Dosa Mahal."}
{"text":"I've been staying with friends a few blocks from this resto and the pink sign and \"Vegan & Vegetarian\" writing always caught my eye. Now, I'm neither strictly vegan nor veggie but I enjoy taking breaks from meat/fish and today I was EXTREMELY happy to walk in and check out this gem of a place.

We shared a spinach and veg Dosa - crisped to perfection with three accompanying dishes and two house chutney's (coconut coriander was UNREAL - coconut tomato a close 2nd), a potato roti with sauce (delictable!) and two chickpea Vaday's (?) with coconut chutney (tasty but weren't quite as fresh as everything else and on the heavy deep fried side). The staff were lovely and friendly, food came quickly and was very affordable. A great selection of appetizers and combination meals that range from vegan, to veg to gluten free priced between $1.00-9.99. 

The people drinking mango lassis at the table across looked very happy - I'll definitely try that next time. A great place to eat-in or take out to Dufferin Grove for a picnic."}
{"text":"If I have to sum up the food here in three words it would be Bad! Bad! Bad!.
 Forget by Indian standards it was bad even by Canadian standards, I don't know about the other reviews but my fellow non-Indian friends, I will say this is not the place to be if u you want an authentic Dosa.
The Dosa was overcooked/burnt , the mashed potato were tasteless and that south Indian Aroma was missing, the chutneys were horrible and most of all the good old sambhar was nowhere near to even an average tasting sambhar it was just a bad concoction  of under-cooked lentils and some unknown vegetables,
I did not had the guts to try anything else.
All I know, the chef/cook had no idea of South-Indian Cuisine.

Totally horrible experience !!!"}
{"text":"Masala dosas, savory and crisp and pleasantly sour, just like in Chennai/Madras. Super mango lassi so thick, I was still sipping on my drive home. Worth a trip!

If you don't know what a dosa is, it's South India's answer to the crepe. Made of fermented rice and lentil flour, it's typically stuffed with spiced potatoes or coconut chutney. South Indian fare is typically gluten free (and usually vegetarian), as they rely on rice instead of wheat for flour. 

Bring a handy wipe or hand sanitizer, because the most authentic part of this experience was eating with the hands. As with any hole in the wall, service was fast, food was cheap, and bathrooms were not advisable."}
{"text":"this was my first time trying dosa but this was definitely the spot to try it. it's basically like dipping some thin ass pancake bread into some cool curry dips with some soup. I wish I had one of these by my house back home in detroit. bomb ass fresh house made lemonade to top it off. insanely dirt cheap dope samosas and pakora here too. like 10/$3. there was a shit load of people grabbing take out while I was there so maybe ill do that next time. I want to try everything here I will def come back"}
{"text":"I love the food here. Cheap, delicious, vegetarian... the service leaves something to be desired but for takeout, it's great. I usually get the vegan special and various deep-fried goodies."}
{"text":"This place has options for all dietary concerns. It is delicious and healthy. The dosas are filling and the service is friendly. The look has changed. Great family business."}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday! Very nice family run place.  Always go for the dosa dishes and leave with a bunch of apps for super cheap!"}
{"text":"Vegan take out box w/ biryani is my go-to. Make sure you order a side of the spicy pickle to go with it.

If you're going to eat in, try the GHEE DOSA platter. If you like the taste of butter you will lose yourself in this hot roll of perfection.

I don't fuck with any of the deep fried things in the glass display case. It's been sitting there all day and more likely for several days. I've tried all of those things hoping they'll be different but it's always stale and gross. There's a reason it's so cheap.

All the stews have this quality like they are days old too but it's less nasty because stews sorta get better as they age.

All I'm saying is that majority of things here are less than fresh. 

Also: I got \"cash back\" on the debit machine and the woman scammed me by not giving me my money and pretending to be confused."}
{"text":"Great place!

Not sure what the heck is going on with the decor... did they decorate it for Valentines Day and forget to take it down, or are all the hearts and pink tablecloths permanent? Bizarre.

Very interesting place with take out samosas and typical Indian \"street food\" available at the front counter for bargain prices ($1 for 3 pieces, or 10 for $3). Also a dine in area with seating for 20-30 or so. Average sized menu with mothly roti and dosa combos.

I'm not gonna lie, this was my first time trying a dosa so I have no basis for comparison. But wow, it was delicious. 

I tried the spinach dosa stuffed with vegetables. It had 3 \"gloops\" of different stuff inside - one potato based, one tomato based and one of lentils. Everything was seasoned really deliciously. The actual dosa was just so tasty and NOT greasy. I always anticipate that any Indian food will be quite oily or greasy, but this was not the case. Pleasantly surprised. 

The dosa came with some sauce type things for dipping and a small soup. All for $7.95"}

Drink??? Food: Cheap Fried Treats

Dear Yelp Drinking Buddy,

Thanks so much for buying me these treats... $3 for 10 and you stop complaining!

Yes I am a cheap date... and I think I deserve better... 

And you ate 3 out of the 4 Samosa which already is the better of all those that we got and so you should be happy.

Told you we should order the Dosa...but no.. we ended up just staring at Vivek's dosa and wondering if he ever comes back or we should just have his for dinner...

blah blah blah...  Where is my food!!!

To be continued....."}
{"text":"Fantastic Dosa! Way too much food for under 20 dollars for two of us. We will definitely make this part of our street food lunch stops."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Their food is fresh, the place is clean and the family is really nice. On that note, this place really does put the 'family' in family restaurant. Go in expecting to have good food at a good price with decent service. The wall is plastered with various 'rules' - a put off until you actually get your food. 
I ordered the masala dosa with vegetable ($8.99), a vaiipan and a sweet patty ($1 for both). Total with tax came to $11 something. 
The dosa was well made and crispy on the outside ( I do have to admit - the one at Guru Laxmi is much better but I wasn't about to drive to north Mississauga - this is one of the better ones in the city.) The potato was nice but a little dry, the eggplant, chickpeas, Sambhar and coconut chutneys were delicious. The sweets were okay - I probably wouldn't they them again as they were too filling and rather unhealthy. 
Service procedure: you enter, walk up to the counter and order - no table service here. They hand you a spoon, cup and water jug which you take to your seat after paying and wait for your ordered food to be brought to you. 
3 stars with one missing for the service and one for the 'rules'. Great food though! I really want to give this place one more star."}
{"text":"If there was the ability to give 3.5 stars, i would have done so. Short and sweet. Came here with a group of 20 and they were very helpful when we had to add more people.

Ordered a bunch of veggie samosa's, potato roti and spinach and potato deep fried something (I can't remember since I didnt order it) to start. All were great.

As a main, i chose the meat and veg thali with goat. I was fantastic. Girlfriend ordered the mysore dosa which was a nice spicy, not too hot. The food was great, but when it came to trying to get water, order and utensils, it all took so long. While they were helpful when it came to adding people to our table, they seem to lack in the smaller things. 

This place looks great for take out."}
{"text":"Came here on a saturday and ordered a thali (biryani) and a masala dosa platter.

Dosa was OK but not crispy.

Biryani was OK but was not freshly prepared.  Curries and sides on the platters were ok, but lacked zing and the fresh pop of flavour you'd normally expect from veggie sambars & curries.

The biggest letdown for me was the dosa, since the restaurant had 'Dosa' in its name.

Not bad for a neighbourhood joint."}
