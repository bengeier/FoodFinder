{"text":"I'm no expert on Jamaican food but despite its humble appearance, they serve some delicious food here, from the Jerk Chicken to the curries to the fish dishes, hard to go wrong."}
{"text":"The Montréal Caribbean is altogether excellent island fare. Get out at métro Vendôme, cross the street and go down the stairs. You can smell the starchy goodness of the rotis that they're cooking up in the back. Steve and Clinton are talented and professional chefs. Say hello and tell them Raj sent you. You'll all have a laugh. I love their Doubles which is practically a sandwich with two puris or Indian fry bread and curried chickpeas as filling. Mmm mmm delectable. Ask for some tamarind chutney on the side and perhaps some authentic Caribbean pepper sauce if you're into the heat scene. The Rasta Greens (various different leafy and collared greens wilted in some delicious concoction of coconut milk and spices) is an excellent and healthful option. The Ital Stew is beautiful. The Jah-Jah Mix is a tasting platter made up of four of their vegetarian options. It is a hearty and special meal. These are all served with an excellent side of dirty rice (rice with tomato and beans) and a roti as well. They have tasty beverages to quench your thirst! Irish Moss is a drink that I had never heard of before dining here. I don't know what on earth it could be but it tastes damn good. Lastly, have a slice of rum cake with a little Appleton's poured on top. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If there is one thing I want you to take away from this review, it's fishcakes.

Obviously I ~could~ talk about their rice 'n' peas, their perfectly-fried plantain or any variety of awesome dishes, but holy moly, the fishcakes are one of the most delicious things you can eat in Montreal and you can quote me on that. 

Like, genuinely. Genuinely you can walk in there and say \"Kim said that the fishcakes are one of the most delicious things in Montreal\" and they won't know who you're talking about or anything, but you'll probably get the fishcakes if you ask for them and they're really delicious.

They come in orders of three, so you're going to want at least two orders, but you might as well get five or six because why the heck not? You can afford it, they're like $3.50/3, plus you can put them in the fridge and they are just as good cold.

Fishcakes!"}
