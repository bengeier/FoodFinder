{"text":"I can't call Number 1 Kitchen the worst Chinese I've ever experienced, because I've eaten in a few places in other states which were even worse.  But I can say it's the worst I've had in Cleveland.  Nay, in Ohio.

A co-worker recommended this place as he and his wife's favorite.  Needless to say, he's fired for future recommendations...

We went with some generic dishes, stuff that every Chinese restaurant sells...kung pao chicken and sesame chicken.  I got the meal, so it came with an egg roll, and I also ordered a side of hot 'n' sour soup.  My kung pao had no sauce at all, it was basically just wok'd chicken and unremarkable veggies, and that's what it tasted like.  The hot 'n' sour soup looked good...but had zero flavor.  None.  Zip.  It's a mystery to me how they could've achieved the look without actually having ANY flavor.  I let my wife try it and her eyes popped open.  \"Wow!  There's no flavor at all?  It's like they boiled water!\"  Actually, water probably would've had more flavor.  Oh, and I asked them to make it insanely spicy.  \"How spicy you want?\"  I told her I wanted it so hot, the cooks in the kitchen complained.  Was it hot?  Not even in the slightest bit.  And I'm not saying that like, \"Oh, I'm so used to heat, I didn't think this was hot,\" way.  I mean an Amish person would've said, \"Wow, this is bland.\"

I tasted my wife's sesame chicken and it at least had some flavor of sesame.  Both our chickens were overdone.  

We'd planned to eat in, but apparently, despite the fact that there are 6 or 8 tables, nobody dines in there.  They handed us our food in takeout packages, having not asked either way.  When we said we wanted to eat in, she looked confused and said, \"Okay, I'll see if I can find some paper plates.\"  She did, with plastic tablewear, but it was pretty primitive.

It was fairly cheap, I'll give you that.  But lord, so is Wal-Mart.  Have some respect.  Find a better Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I have been ordering food from here for years. Since the change in owners it has gone down hill.
I ordered Pork egg foo young and when i got home with my food i opened it to eat. It was ALL ONIONS. MY husband called to let them know and their response was that's how it's made. I have had it at many other Chinese restaurants and also from there before and NEVER was it made like this. My husband offered to bring it back to get another one and they said they would CHARGE us for another one. NEVER going back....... Sad that we have gone there for years."}
