{"text":"My 1st experience of caribbean food. This will NOT be my last.   I am IN LOVE with Jerk Chicken and Ox Tail.  I also tried Brown stew as well.   You have to try this place out.  I will be back over and over and over again!  You can have the food spicy or REALLY spicy you just let the boss man Stuch know!   I will be writing a more detailed review in the future"}
{"text":"We went for a friend's bday party. Unfortunately, by 9:00 pm, Over by Stuch was sold out of the whole fish entree and prawns. Instead, I ordered oxtail stew, which was rich and flavourful. The goat stew was also good - not tough at all. The chicken and vegetarian rotis are very filling and such good value - I think both were under $7.00. Great prices, tasty food, and something different from the usual Japanese/pizza places."}
{"text":"i love caribbean food.   id give over by stuch 3.5/5. ive dined here about 3 times and picked up once. ive only tried the jerk chicken & ox tail. jerk chicken is really good, the flavor is embedded into the chicken, NOT just on the surface of the chicken, like how it should be. chicken is moist, not dry. ox tail isnt as consistent as jerk chicken but when its good, its gooooooooooood."}
