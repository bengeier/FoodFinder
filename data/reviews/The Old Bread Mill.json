{"text":"This place is charming, with gorgeous pastries and lots of interesting imported Italian groceries. It's a great place to stop in for a hot drink and a snack on a cold day--the hot chocolate comes from a powered mix, but it's made with steamed milk and dusted with cocoa and trust me, it's delicious anyway. And the bakery side more than holds its own on the hand-made front!"}
{"text":"I don't recommend this bad bakery to anyone, last week I ordered by phone a blue cake no 1 and during the call i tried to confirm with him all my order but he was very rude and told me ok ok without listening, ,,,  and my friend picked up yesterday and she was surprised the cake was rond cake and yellow with 2 flower blue ..before the birthday party 3 hours ? She wasn't have no choice and she called me and I said go for it ,, it was a nasty cake and melt and he ruined my party with his disgusting cake,, and today when I called him to complain again he wasn't listen to me and he don't care with the complaints, screaming on me  and hang up the phone,,, there are very fare from customers satisfaction,  I will not recommend this bakery to my worst enemy Here the photo of the cake"}
{"text":"So, very, very good! Only problem is I go in expecting to buy a bun and leave $50 lighter every time. Huge selection of Italian goodies. Wish every street had a spot like this. I can remember when that was the case."}
{"text":"I tried their buns/bread; I personally preferred other bakeries.   Their red velvet cupcakes do not look like the picture you see anymore.   The cream cheese icing just filled on top of the cupcake; nothing inside.  I cut it exactly like the picture posted from another yelper but mine clearly didn't have any cream cheese icing in it :S  I was so disappointed."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! We always buy all of our food and desserts for special occasions at the old bread mill and they never disappoint! The millefoglie is THE BEST!"}
{"text":"Was in the area looking for lunch before heading to a job - yelped the location and I was right around the corner- so I thought it was a perfect opportunity. I love delis.            I wasn't impressed with this place. For lunch I grabbed a slice of pizza and rice balls.  I had read a review about how amazing their donuts where so I picked some up. The pizza was cold and really greasy. I took a few bites and stopped eating it. Rice balls were okay but luke warm. The donut wasn't anything spectacular.. And no one really smiled. Oh well!    They had a huge selection of desserts, cheese and meats. I would go back and try all that out, but wouldn't get the lunch foods again."}
{"text":"GREAT little italian bakery and deli! Fantastic breads, including all your italian faves, plus flavoured and traditional baguettes, cookies, canoli, etc. a selection of italian canned goods and jars, and a little hot-table in the back beside the cold-cut counter. I haven't had the pasta yet, or a veal sandwich, tending to prefer the freshly fried version to the hot-table soaking in sauce type, but I can tell you that their thick square slices of sicilian-style pizza are awesome, especially the veggie - loaded with mushrooms, olives and big strips of red, yellow and orange peppers! Yum!"}
{"text":"They do it all - delicious and authentic Italian pastries, cakes for any occasion (that always get compliments), hot table, cold cuts, fresh breads, a grocery section, and great espresso. Service is friendly. My family and I have been going here for years!"}
{"text":"love the fresh pastry, any day of the week.  price point is okay, good variety of sandwiches in deli section.  great sandwiches.  and great customers service"}
{"text":"I purchased baguettes and some pizza. The pizza was disgusting so oily and the crust was extra thick. To top it off a greasy sausage. 1 star for that   The baguettes were tasty so they deserve some props for that."}
{"text":"My husband just discovered their homemade donuts....OMG!  Now that's a donut!  We also love to buy their whole lasagna to bake at home.  We tried many lasagnas and this is our favorite.  Can't forget their veal sandwiches...  The best!"}
{"text":"The pastries here are well below Italian standard. Had to grab a few pastries in a pinch as nothing else was open, and I had company coming for dinner. Would have been better off with a fruit platter. Only thing I recommend buying here is their Calabrese bread. That's it."}
{"text":"DO NOT SHOP HERE! Staff has been extremely rude every single time I have gone into this place. They roll their eyes and are constantly complaining as if their job is an inconvenience to them. On top of that, their products aren't really that good. The longevity of their bread and cold cuts is horrendous. On top of that, the staff is racist and discriminatory. I witnessed a young girl in a hijab walk in and hand in her resume and the second she left they threw her resume in the garbage and called her a derogatory name. Terrible place with terrible people. A friend worked there and said that her boss was the worst human being on the planet and that she quit because she was horribly mistreated. I'm never coming here ever again."}
{"text":"Great veal parmigiana here.  It can get a bit pricey with the toppings you add to it, but I think it's worth it for a great quick lunch/light dinner.  I have also had many kinds of pastries from here and they are really good. They also have a few other items on the hot table to take out like rice balls, and eggplant Parmesan. Try it !"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a disgrace, they have no reservations, no take out or delivery and most importantly they do not allow kids!"}
{"text":"Good selection of pastries. The apple turn over was good as well as the chocolate croissants. Love their long espresso. But the Italian man behind the counter is not friendly at all. I was not sure if he was the owner.  He did not smile the whole time we were there, I ordered pastries and coffee, and I even ordered pastries to go. I wouldn't mind coming back for the good food, but service is another story."}
{"text":"Old style bakery. I used to leave on the corner of this place. I love it.  Pies are amazing people are positive. If you want to get fresh bakery good place to try. Cakes are amazing as well. It reminds me 90s. You also can have cup of tee/ coffee there."}
{"text":"Love love love the pastries!! They're so incredibly fresh & delicious. Their bread & buns are wonderful too. Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Noticed them while buying pasta next door. Decided to go in and was pleasantly surprised to see the baked good selection. Got a few sweets as well as (self serve) buns. The cannoli was creamy and the shell was nice and crispy. The egg tart was also good. My low score is because during cash out, the cashier stuck her hand in the bag of buns to see which 3 I chose. They're in a clear produce bag, no need to touch the bread with your unwashed hands. She's handling cash, she shouldn't be touching food like that - very unhygienic."}
{"text":"Old school traditional Italian bakery in Richmond Hill that really does it all. Good selection of pastries, make a good cake, nice selection of fresh baked breads, some specialty imported Italian products, a limited selection of deli essentials at the back counter and a hot table with most of the staples you'd expect to see. Been coming here for years, whether dropping in for a pastry and espresso breakfast, lunch at the hot table, or picking up bread. Really can't go wrong, I'd suggest the porchetta sandwich, veal plate or Sicilian cannoli."}
{"text":"I have seen many places inside this bakery including the back. If you care about how your food is stored... don't eat here..."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch. Had a veal sandwich and split a pizza slice with a friend. Sandwich was great, good size and priced appropriately. Pizza is room temperature but tasted great. Got a couple espressos and donuts to go. The sugar donuts are authentic Southern Italian and fantastic and great espresso. Overall the bakery and hot table offer lots of options and I will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"The Old Bread Mill is really a deli, Cafe, Bakery, fast food all in one!   Mainly Italian bread, pastry, cakes, grocery, deli, cooked food and more.   There are a 4 small table in the front of the store if you do decide to have a cappuccino ($2.75) and have a veal panini as a light lunch.   There are also 1 day old croissant at the counter 2 for $1.. hey they taste as good if you put it in the toaster oven and heat that up at home.   The Old Bread Mill is like a one stop Italian food place and it has a more homey and traditional vibe."}
{"text":"I personally think it's the best bread in the area, good cold cuts, special and delicious home made donuts, but they are only on Saturday and Sunday! They also make a good espresso!"}
