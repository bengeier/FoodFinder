{"text":"If you are going to charge $15.99 for Chicken Parmesan in Tallmadge it better be out of this world good, this was not.  I think they may have priced the menu right out of the market for the Tallmadge area.  It also helps if you train/require your staff to taste and know the menu.  Good luck, with that food you're going to need it."}
{"text":"Service was good, however, food times were really slow. Quality of the food is below average and prices above average. My son got a medium pizza with 4 toppings that was close to 20 bucks.  Waaay to costly for a pizza.  The dough was undercooked and soggy. My husband had chicken parmesan, which was ok and a decent portion for a half size. I had the Italian perogies...this sounds good but was a confused mess taste wise. Overall...we won't be back."}
{"text":"Service is never good here and probably why the N Canton store is much busier than this one in Tallmadge. Today it wasn't busy at all for lunch and service was horrible. Bread was good as usual but I had to go find the server bot side plates. I asked sever what lettuce was used in salads, she told me mixed greens with romain. It was iceburg ."}
{"text":"I've got to say, I wasn't sure what to expect going here because I've lived in the area for 5 years and in that time, have seen this location as several different restaurants that have come and gone. Also wasn't sure how a finer Italian restaurant would fit into Tallmadge. We went at 930 on a Friday evening and it was empty, we were literally the only diners with the exception of one other table. I wasn't sure if this was a good sign. We ordered the garlic cheesy bread as an appetizer and were delightfully surprised when it came out essentially as a pizza with marinara sauce. Well worth the price  and full of delicious, melted cheesiness. I then ordered the half chicken parm and my boyfriend got the Cajun fettuccine, he's always a spicy person. We were both surprised at the amount of food that came with the half order, plus they each came with bread. Mine came with a garlic knot, his had a large baguette. My chicken parm was cooked wonderfully, very fresh. His Cajun fettuccini had the most unique taste for a pasta, very well done. We couldn't get over how perfect the asparagus pieces were cooked. Literally to the exact right crispness without getting soggy. His plate was heaping due to the sauce, some spilling off when it was delivered. Since the sauce was runnier, a bowl might've been more appropriate. We both boxed up our leftovers and they made for a great lunch the next day. 

I was impressed with the service also. As I said, it was later in the evening and very empty. Our waiter could've been annoyed we came in somewhat close to closing and he could've been exhausted from a long shift about to end, but he was very chipper and attentive. We tipped him accordingly. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We just ordered pizza and salads from this place it is so nice inside and everyone is very polite. I highly recommend this place I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Visited Danny Boys Tallmadge for first time last night.  I was very pleased with the experience. There were three of us and all agreed it was great.  Was there with older two sons. My son ordered The chicken parm was very good.  Caution...order the 1/2  portion unless you want for lunch the next day. My other son ordered the ravioli dish that was very good.  I had the Italian cob salad...1/2 portion was excellent.  The surprise was we ordered the bread with dipping marinara sauce . Came piping hot and enough for everyone.  Very good!  Waitress and manager came over numerous times for our input and if we needed anything.  The chicken parm was couple dollars above normal but so are the portions.   The 1/2 order is plenty and more reasonable.  My guess is 1/2 portion is one patty and full is two.   Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Danny Boys because I love Frank Sinatra - he is the main theme of the restaurant.  I am also constantly in search of a nice restaurant that serves great pizza and high-end wines.  Enter Danny Boys...

Years ago I frequented an Italian restaurant in Aurora, Ohio that played nothing but Frank Sinatra music.  I cannot stress enough the importance of music while dining or shopping or painting or working.  My first visit to Danny Boys sent me to Sinatra heaven music-wise - for about 20 minutes.  Suddenly I found myself staring at a Frank and Nancy Sinatra portrait while listening to hip-hop music.  Obviously the restaurant manager had gone home and the youngsters had taken over.

Danny Boys shares a kitchen with the Firehouse, however a patron cannot choose a good wine from Danny Boys' list while dining in the Firehouse and a patron cannot choose various flavors of chicken wings from the Firehouse while dining at Danny Boys... huh??  These two locations share restrooms, a kitchen and a narrow hallway.  I guess accounting supercedes a diner's ability to enjoy everything these two establishments can offer.  The ownership is going to make you  choose one or the other.

Although the pizza at Danny Boys is \"ok\" it is extremely expensive to order something halfway normal - a patron will have to build it themselves.  Their specialty pizzas have cutsie names relating to Sinatra's cohorts, however who wants angel hair pasta or peas on their pizza?  Why can't one order the specialty pizza toppings on a crust of their choice without paying an arm and a leg?  And lastly why can't I play KENO at Danny Boys and watch the draws.  I am plum tuckered out from running 20 feet through a hallway to check my numbers.  

The restaurant boasts a \"Woogie\" and a Calzone... what's the dif?  Hell, I had to look it up online.  That pretty much makes the menu useless.

The wines are well chosen, however the young waitstaff glogs them into the glass - sediment and all - without a second thought.  Danny Boys doesn't seem to have a wine-by-the-glass dating system whereby they replace wines that have been uncorked for days.  You have a good chance of getting a skunky/sour $8 glass of wine each time you dine here.

The pizza is nothing to brag about, the waitstaff is slow and ill-trained, there never seems to be a greeter at the front on arrival (so expect a wait), and they have never been busy when I've eaten there.

Sad really...."}
{"text":"The meal was very good and the service was excellent! I would highly recommend making this a destination for lunch or date night.
Great tv's everywhere for all the sporting events."}
{"text":"I thought I would give this place a try since I always see deals for pizza here. I thought overall it was very much average. I got a 2 topping pizza and order of their cheese bread. The cheese bread was terrible like seriously don't ever get it and the pizza itself was just ok more comparable to Marcos or cheaper chain pizza restaurant. I have far better options in stow and Hudson where I normally order from so I will stick with them. I won't be back here at Danny boys again"}
{"text":"Love their pizza and calzones -- light tasty crust and sweet sauce. I'm glad they've opened a location much closer to home."}
{"text":"My takeout pizza order didn't live up to the hype.  I was excited to ordera large Clevelander pizza, but disappointed, sort of, with the taste of it.  The Clevelander is described as a \"New York thin crust, pizza cheese, extra pepperoni, sprinkle of garlic and fresh basil all ripped Chicago style with pizza sauce and Parmesan cheese.\"  The crust:  less than 1/4 inch thick but no hole structure when you get to the edge.  The bottom 1/32 of the crust was not charred like New York style is supposed to, but the next 3/32 -inch was made up of a chewy bread like a classic NY style pizza.  The edge of the crust was chewy and buttery, far from being crisp and charred like a classic NY style pizza.   The sprinkle of garlic was more like a few extra sprinkles (if you love garlic you'll love the extra garlic they add) and I didn't even know the pizza had basil in it until I copied the pizza description for this review.  The pepperoni was above average and the sauce was also above average but not something to write home about like Guiseppe's pizza sauce.

Overall it was an okay pizza.  I was expecting something much better given the reviews and the accolades."}
{"text":"Great food- very classy (but fun) decor- the staff was very helpful and friendly. Handicap accessible- many many options on the menu (primarily pasta and pizza). We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The bread rolls were great. Pizza was ok. Might have been better if they served me the pizza I ordered. Waitress said they brought the wrong pizza and didnt even try to correct the error. Service was also slow. First and last visit."}
{"text":"Second visit today and I doubt I'll go back. I don't think the food was fresh. It seemed to be reheated from yesterday."}
{"text":"I have tried this location multiple times. The service is beyond slow but the kitchen is even slower. One time the manger told me parents that he didn't have time to talk to them about their experience. Not going back again."}
{"text":"Food tastes good. Service was good. It did seem to take a little bit longer than expected to get out food. Fun atmosphere! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Hostess said the kitchen was 10 minutes behind?? and that we had to wait, even though half the restaurant was empty. We didn't want to bother them with our money so we took it elsewhere"}
{"text":"We ordered the pierogis and sausage, the Stoplight pasta with both sausage and chicken along with a red sangria. The food tasted fresh and flavorful. We loved the marinara sauce that came with the meals. The peppers in the meal tasted fresh and had a slight crunch, perfect.  The sangria was adequate. Not the best I have had but not worthy of reducing the rating.  The atmosphere was warm and pleasing being clean and inviting. We will be back again."}
{"text":"The pizza is very good.  We have always had good service when eating here. The atmosphere is casual. This is the only restaurant that has been in this space that we hope will continue to stay open. It seems to be a popular spot with Tallmadge families!"}
