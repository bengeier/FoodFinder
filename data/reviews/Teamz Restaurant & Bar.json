{"text":"Had a bbq chicken pizza which was pretty good! Odd atmosphere.... Not busy. Mix of young and older people. I was here for the dinner crowd, so it might be different later."}
{"text":"I will no longer eat from this bar anymore. The service is awful. I walked in to pick up my carry out and the bartender was playing on her phone for at least 5 minutes. She failed to acknowledge me but had no problem talking with some guys at the end of the bar. Not to mention the server that was working walked right past me and didn't acknowledge me STANDING at the bar. Not only did this happen to me, it happened to my girlfriend earlier this past week when she picked up an order, and my sister as well. The service is awful and luckily for the owners I'm a decent person and paid for my food because I could have very easily walked out without paying. The bartender was too focused on her phone to know what was going on. I can assure you I will no longer waste my money at this establishment."}
{"text":"Awesome bar food the pizza is amazing, Milwaukee's best on draft all day everyday for $1.25. Great spot great people"}
{"text":"Great place. Half price pizza (around $6) on Saturdays is hard to beat. Pizza is great and there are lots of TV's. It never seems like the large, 60\"+ tv's are on HD. Teamz is great, especially now that the road construction is done."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Had a reservation for 7 after boat show. Arrived 7, completely unprepared. Manager moved us to another table. It is now 8:30 still have not received food. Absolute joke. Manager trying hard but understaffed and clueless. It gets better, food finally came out at almost 9. My food a burger came out cold and burnt. Classic. The manager later returned and verbally aggressive back to me. To a point where a friend of mine jumped in and said enough. The manger did remove some items from bill, expected. I came away shocked at managers behavior. Embarrassing, hope the owner has a pulse to their restaurant. We watched multiple groups walk out because service was so poor. With all the good food out there. Don't waste your time at this establishment. You will be disappointed."}
{"text":"In 2016, what sports bar does not have HD? Are you kidding me? Could've watched the OSU game ar home in 10x the better quality. As big as this place is and as is big as the parking lot was expanded, can't believe the joke of SD quality tvs. Owner(s), you should be embarrassed. I'm embarrassed for you! Your staff was embarrassed when I asked for the HD channel! Get your act together. Not to mention, your service was far from impeccable.  Maybe you should close for another 2 yrs and get your act together! At least before you could blame it on roadway construction. Will not be back here."}
{"text":"When we went there Steelers fans were everywhere ..they were loud rude foul mouthed obnoxious and took over half the  restraunt ! Have to say the food was decent but couldn't enjoy our meal at all . Craft beer selection was fair, I guess if your gonna go there don't go during a Steelers game."}
{"text":"Interesting place, pretty much what you would expect from a quasi-divey local Cleveland-area sports bar.  The inside is cute and casual, plenty of TVs and some video games.  It's not mood-lit or super loud like a lot of places, which was nice.  The food varied widely depending on the order.  The cheese stick appetizers were nice, tasted fresh, served hot and with a really nice marinara sauce.  We made the mistake of also ordering the calamari strips (the \"strips\" should have been the first hint).  They tasted fine, but not like calamari.  They looked and tasted like fish sticks, which is alright if you like fish sticks but just weird for calamari.  For the entr√©e, I got the filet, which was super cheap and really awesome.  My sister got the ribs, which fell off the bone and were perfectly cooked.  My brother in law seemed less than happy with his fish, but fish at sports bars is always hit-or-miss, so I think avoiding fish seems to be a good option.  The entrees took awhile to serve considering the place wasn't busy, but the service was friendly.  Overall, I'd give this place a \"nice.\"  It's a good place to go to have a cheap but hearty meal and a beer, and spend time watching a game.  It won't knock your socks off with culinary inspiration or lightning-fast service, but it's nice in the way that a regular hangout place would be.  I'd go again."}
{"text":"Great food, and service. I notified the management about the marquee misspelling."}
{"text":"I was here for a fundraising event, so I can't speak as much to the general bar and food. However, I have to say that the fact that they have their own dedicated party room is really nice, and we had great service. Pizza is typical \"bar pizza\" but actually was pretty good, and their wings were awesome! This bar is kind of out of the way but it has a good atmosphere and plenty of TVs for watching games."}
{"text":"Visit for the first time last week. Been meaning to stop in to try it out. Pizza was great better then any chain around.  Check it out!  I had chili and side salad and was impressed chili great taste not for can and side salad was great.  The other person I was with had the Po boy said it was great not over cooked. Waitress was amazing! We dont have many choices to go out to dine and have great service will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Been here several times, I promised myself never again.  Ordered a steak dinner and asked the Server if the mashed potatoes were instant, she said \" Oh no they make them here\".  Can't beleive she wouldn't know that sure enough they were instant, yuk, they tase like wall paper paste.  Steak was like eating beef jerky, I had to spit out several bites, not digestable.  Vegtable was cold.  Server was nice enough but waiting tables should not be her career path.  I'm convinced the manager has little experience in restaurant management and could care less if the servers are doing all they can to make sure the patrons are happy, I could tell by watching him. It's quite possible that this place is only open for  tax loss reasons. ."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to Teamz twice now and have had a good experience and a very bad experience. The 1st thing I notice on both visits were the amount of weeds in the flower bed when you are walking up to the front door - tacky.  The 1st time we went to Teamz we had a nice experience. We sat on the patio and had a nice meal. The server was pleasant and attentive; the food came out quickly and tasted great. With that said it was in poor taste for our server and the restaurant manager to smoke out on the patio in front of customers. Judging by the layout of the property they may have limited options for a smoke break, but never do it in front of a customer.  Our 2nd time at Teamz was awful. We were greeted and sat right away. The server came over right away and took our drink orders. When she brought our drinks out she attempted to take our food order, but we needed another minute due to a question with coupon we had - no big deal. 15 minutes passed until she came back! In her defense she did have a large party, but where was the manager? In that 15 minutes I never saw a manger walking the floor, checking on tables - big no no. The server finally comes back, and I expressed my dismay, she apologized and explained she had a large party; ok water under the bridge. Shortly after she left I noticed I needed another beer - no big deal I will grab her the next time is comes around.....she never came back around, I sat with an empty beer for 10 minutes (felt like an hour - have you ever been to a restaurant and not seen your server for a total of 25 minutes?). I finally got fed up and asked the bartender to cancel our food order and asked to have the bill for our drinks. She went to grab a manager, but the server and manager where actually bringing out our food. At this point I really wasn't happy - I explained to the manager that waiting 15 minutes to order and sitting an additional 10 minutes with an empty beer was unacceptable and she agreed. She went to spoke to the other manager, (who was doing a nice job holding up the wall) and decided to comp mine and my wife's meals as well as took off 1 beer (had 2). I give the manager credit she tried to make the situation right, but you can tell the place is managed on reactive vs. a proactive style.  It is important to point out that this was a Friday night and the place wasn't busy at all. 7pm on Friday night, that place should be packed! I have a feeling I know why it isn't. All in all, the manager did her best fix the situation, but it could have been avoided if she had spent more time on the floor."}
{"text":"Very disappointed during our last visit. First of all, make sure you ask for your Customer Loyalty Card on your first visit. Didn't even know they had this program. We had eaten at least 5 meals there when our server asked me if I had the Loyalty Card. With the card once you accumulate 100 points, they give you a tiny piece of paper that says 10 dollars off. Make sure you don't lose that tiny piece of paper like I did. We went back 3 days later so we could eat their fabulous half price pizza. The special is good on Saturdays and Wednesdays. Then everything went downhill. i told them I had lost that tiny piece of paper. TOO BAD FOR ME!  The minute they print the tiny piece of paper, the computer puts you back to zero and you have lost your discount. The manager was not obliging in the least. i found out some servers ask you before they print the coupon whether you want to use it today or keep it in the computer  till next time - NOT MY SERVER- Maybe she wasn't given orientation training when she started"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. When my burger came out and I saw a pile of shredded cheddar, I started to get a little nervous, but the burger was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. They definitely know how to cook here, and the prices were reasonable. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the service wasn't amazing. The bartender seemed to be very displeased to be working lunch. I will definitely be back but hopefully I'll have someone a little friendlier serving me."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. Spicy garlic wing sauce was good. Rest of the food was ok. Place is clean and the staff was cleaning when I was there so that put my mind at ease. Looked like the bartender had a dip in her mouth though. Pretty sure that's a health code issue."}
{"text":"Good dive bar but waitress was slow (wasnt busy) and wings were \"eh\". Honey BBQ wingies were tasty and good beer specials keep me comin back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative stars for this but yelp won't let me. This place is a disgusting joke of an establishment. First, We ordered chips and salsa for an appetizer.... chips and salsa ended up being chips with a dinky cup of jar salsa and it took 20 minutes to get it. We asked our server about it and it turns out she never entered it in the computer so, strike one.   My sister nearly choked on the cheese wrapper they left on the piece of cheese on her sandwich. I've never even seen anything like this. I watched my sister choke on a cheese wrapper. Strike two. I repeat... my 23 year old sister choked on a wrapper left on her sandwich.   Then strike three came when the server handed my dad the bill and my sisters $10 sandwich with a wrapper on it was on the bill. There was no remedy of the situation. They also messed up my sisters boyfriends meal, which they offered to fix. But apparently if a foreign object is on your sandwich you just have to eat it(?).  I want to be angry but it all was so bad that we have to laugh about it. I would probably go dumpster diving for my next meal before I would even think about coming back here and I'm not even being extreme."}
{"text":"Teamz has made a lot of changes recently. If you haven't been in a while, it's worth checking it out again! Great specials, especially on Thursdays for the steak. So delicious! Service is usually pretty good, but ALWAYS friendly.  Love the karaoke nights, good drink specials and a wide variety of menu items.  We have hosted several events at Teamz over the years and they have always been very accomodating and affordable. Glad they were able to stick around through all the construction Middleburg put them through!"}
{"text":"Today was the first time going to Teamz. My husband and I were very impressed!  Staff was nice, place was clean, and food was AMAZING!  We both had burgers and ordered the mozzarella sticks.  Both the burgers and sticks were made fresh not frozen!  Oh...and the fries...AWESOME!"}
{"text":"This place is garbage. Staff has no experience so the service is slow. Food is nothing speacil. Atmosphere is kind of grimy. Would not recommend."}
