{"text":"I discovered this charming little spot during the Hot Chocolate Festival, when I tried their delicious Lavender Mocha. The owner is lovely and makes quality drinks, and the location is delightfully tiny and friendly. I hope to come back often!!"}
{"text":"Kaffeeklatsch is now in the lobby of the Cambrian Centre 1000 Veterans Pl NW, Calgary.

... and sometimes one gets lucky enough to run into Jessica at Shelf Life Books or another one of her pop-up locations. 

Kk serves up some of the very best coffee in Calgary.  I miss the YWCA Kaffeeklatsch closet though - that was a fab space."}
{"text":"Kaffeeklatsch is less a coffee shop and more a coffee... closet? It fits quite nicely inside of a cupboard at the back of the Community Wise building on 12th Ave. Go, you'll see what I mean. It's adorable.

The day I showed up, the espresso machine was acting up a bit, such is the life sometimes I suppose! But me and my little cup of Americano enjoyed each other just the same.

Part of what makes this coffee shop concept so endearing is its name. Kaffee, meaning coffee, and klatsch, a social gathering, especially for coffee and conversation. You might think of it as coffee time with your girlfriends or your grandmother. Awww!

Stop by and get your cup to go, or bring a friend and hang out over your favourite cup in the seating area just to the other side of the closet.

Directions: Walk in the door, turn right, follow the K symbols on the ground to the back."}
{"text":"I keep requesting that this listing be deleted. Kaffeeklatsch is still around as a mobile cart and popup but this location is no more and was never intended to be close to permanent. Right now it's a popup at Shelf Life Books. I love it, love the coffee, love Jessica, but yelp is doing a disservice to her by not removing this listing."}
{"text":"oh my god - cutest coffee shop in the world! 
Located inside the Community Wise Resource Centre (http://communitywise.net/) this little coffee closet is a hidden gem! 
Go in the front doors, and go to the right - follow the little \"K\"s on the floor down to the end of the hall, turn left, and there it is! 
There's a little seating area to the left if you want to sit for a bit, or just walk down the hall and look at all the other cool stuff that is in this building! 
I'm very excited that my coworkers and I stumbled upon this place today, and we will definitely be returning!"}
