{"text":"I've been going to Art's since they were in the strip mall on the North Service Road. (behind Oakville Place). This was a frequent Friday's dinner in my childhood (1960-70's). Mom would phone in our order and my brother and me would go and pick it up. Art always told us to thank our mom for her business. The fish was always well cooked, never mushy or over-cooked. Fries were heavenly when he would sneak a few for us before it was wrapped up. They steamed on the way home and lost some of the crisp, but were still tasty on the plate. This was straight forward no-nonsense cooking. This was F&C's as it was in the 60's. Original owner Art - 4 stars    Fast forward to 2012. I hadn't been in there since maybe the mid 80's. New location on Sixth Line. Same people, same menu. The fish was still tasty but there was too much batter and it was very greasy. Fries were good.  Nick & Liz - 3 stars  New owners again. Owner was on the phone complaining about Internet service while on her cel-phone. I had to repeat my order twice because she was standing so close to me, and the woman taking my order couldn't hear me. The fish was properly cooked, the batter was crispy and not really greasy at all. The fries, unfortunately, were mushy and/or undercooked on the inside. The serving woman wrapped it up so quickly that I didn't see that the coleslaw I paid for wasn't there until I got home.  I can overlook bad service for good food. But not both. If I go back it will be for the fish only. New Owners - 2 stars"}
{"text":"Had take out tonight. 3 orders of halibut and fries and an order of onion rings totalled $67. Food was horrible. Thick heavy and oily batter on the fish and onion rings. Pieces of fish were all batter with maybe 1/4 inch thick fillet of halibut. I was shocked at how thin the pieces of fish were especially considering the over all price. It is now under new management and something is not right."}
{"text":"I had hoped for the fish and chips like hen I visited the UK, but they fell under my expectation.  However the owner and daughter were very pleasant and took pride in their product.  I had hoped the fish wasn't frozen but perhaps that's an unrealistic expectation?  I'll let you decide.  The chips were average."}
{"text":"Fairly good fish n chips, nothing special but nothing bad. Although their tartar sauce isn't good. But good service and they have fun trivia cards at each table!"}
{"text":"I lived in Oakville back in 2007 and loved going to this place.  Small family owned establishment with great quality food and friendly owners.  You could tell they change their oil and don't reuse old oil.  Here I am writing a review 7 years later, so it definitely left an impression on me."}
{"text":"i have been going here sporadically since 2006 or so. And i have always had a pleasant experience with the food and service. The waitress is especially friendly, and will talk story with you as you wait for your meal.Art's is  a friendly family owned business with tasty crispy chips, and fresh fried fish. i liked the decor to. It sort of reminds me of a quaint Maine town. Like i feel New England vibes here. It would be TOTALLY EXCELLENT if they sold some whoopie pies for dessert! mmhhmhmhmm!  My only gripe is the packets for the tartar sauce. It is a bit of a hassle when you've got to continually open these mini tartar sauce packets. And then you gotta put da kine on your fish/fries. It would be wise of them to invest in a large tartar sauce dispenser to fend off the mortal coil of repeatedly opening small sauce packets.  One tartar sauce dispenser per table would do the trick. However, they can still keep the tartar sauce packets for takeout meals. Anyways, besides that little complaint, this place stays da kine lidat, and I would definitely recommend Art's for all fish and chip lovers out there!!   Oh yeah, the most recent time i went, i ordered mushy peas and they didn't give me the mushy peas (but i was not charged of course). Perhaps they didn't have any left? It's all cool, no huhu, i can forgive this. Next time i go i am sure they will have mushy peas. :)"}
{"text":"Wow. Really bad food. Greasy, taste weird. I will not be going back. It's just bland, greasy and not worth it."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and the service was great. I did like the simple nautical decor of this place.   I was disappointed how bland/boring the food was, some kind of spin on the traditional fish and chips would be nice to see here.   Had half haddock and fries, and the serving portion was very generous. Everything was super oily though, so I'm not sure about going back any time soon."}
