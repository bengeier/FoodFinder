{"text":"I went to azuba restaurant first time today,got myself a chicken naan wrap for takeout. First of all. It was way too spicy for my taste and secondly there was no \"kabob\"in my wrap, instead it contained sliced chicken, almost  like shawarma meat, kabob is supposed to be made with ground meat in a form of almost a hot dog , and not sliced like shawarma .  This is a constructive criticism ,not trying to give them bad name , I hope they LEARN."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Azuba! I went for the $10.99 lunch buffet and I thought it was totally worth the money.... They had a wide variety of non veg and veg food. My favourite there would be the tandoori chicken because it was marinated really really well and had a lot of flavour, whereas some restaurants just add a lot of food colouring to trick you into thinking its flavourful but actually tastes like dry crap. I wasn't a fan of the butter chicken because I thought it was a little too mild and sweet, but overall it was definitely worth the money and I would go there again :)"}
{"text":"Awesome service and great tasting food... I love the staff as they went out of their way to make sure they give options for us based on dietary restrictions!!  The food was super tasty... I love the machurian and paneer!!! Highly recommended for a family get together and visiting with friends..."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon brunch in Mississauga's Azuba was not the best experience. The location of this area should give you an indication as to what to expect. Located near the airport south of Dixie and 407 the exterior doesn't look much.  The interior is actually nice and elegant, and quite up to date.  However the service was very slow when we ordered NAAN, which never came.  Also ordering india chai, which took forever.  We had to ask two servers about our tea, and only then did it finally arrive.  The choices of foods for its price was not bad at all, ranging between $10 lunch and dinner which is $12.99.  The place was overall clean, and there were a hand full of choices for foods, but overall I have had better.  This is no where incomparable to India's Taste, nor Tandoori Flame which are on the upper echelons of Indian buffets!"}
{"text":"Cheap buffet. $12.99 for dinner, I believe. But the food, in my experience, is worse than what you pay for. It is usual for an Indian buffet to be that price along the Brampton-Mississauga border and do a FAR better job (hint: India's Taste). I can't believe this restaurant is a sister restaurant to Avani (which is actually far better). Deets as follows:   Ambience: This is a massive place, nice seating area, decent decor. The dull, ripped, PU-leather tablecloths are a serious turn off. You want to look upscale? You got to do it right.  Service: The waiters shuffle around lazily. It's kind of annoying. And when you need one, you can't find one. We could've walked out of there without paying and nobody would've noticed. Hurray! Free dinner! We paid though.   Crowd: Medium-big groups of family, colleagues, Caucasian people who don't know any better.    Variety: Very little choice in the buffet. Ironically the two hakka items - chilli chicken and chowmein - were probably the best of the lot. The tandoori chicken was not too bad either. The butter chicken was a disaster. Too watery. What's Indian food without some good old butter chicken?   Verdict? Never going back."}
