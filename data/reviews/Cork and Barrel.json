{"text":"Worth a try for sure! They were not very busy when we went in for an afternoon wine flight and a couple appetizers. Hummus was really good and warm (cold day) and the cheese plate was probably a 3.5 or 4 star but when your getting wine, cheese just makes sense. Also for the price it was probably more of a 4 (good cheese plates can be expensive...). 
As far as wine, we did flights of 3 and the somalie chose for us after giving him an idea of what we liked. He had some interesting options (a Barcelona, moscato that tasted more like a Chardonnay) and a nice solid pino noir. We all drank all the wine on our flights none tasted cheap. everyone was happy, didn't feel rushed or under/over served. Give it a try. Very professional and good ambiance not to fast or too slow.  For the flight and two appetizers we hit about 18/person."}
{"text":"This place is the embodiment of what a wine bar should be. Casual atmosphere, fireplace, even a more exclusive private room. The decor, sights and sounds are the perfect backdrop. The food selection is on spot, and the wines are hand selected by an expert on all things wine. Whether a casual night out or a first date, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"My mom, sister, and I stopped in here after a day of shopping for a quick bite to eat and a glass of wine. Wow, they really updated this place!  We had been here several times when it was the Vintage House, but absolutely loved what they did with the place!  It is modern, sophisticated, and cozy. 

We had the Margherita flatbread and the shrimp  dip skillet.  It was fabulous!  Great portion sizes for 3 people.  The whole menu looked great. Wonderful options for everyone's tastes. 

The staff was very friendly and attentive. It's so refreshing going to place where the staff truly enjoys their jobs.  

We will definitely be back soon!  Give this place a shot, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Spur of the moment we yelped somewhere near playcle where we dropped our kids off.. 
we arrived on a Friday at 6:30 without a reservation. We were seated right away. I had a flight of wine which were all very good. The cheese plates looked amazing but we went right to entrees. I had the filet and my hubby had the salmon. They were both very good! I am excited to come back and try other things!"}
{"text":"Tried this location for the very first time and I recommend it! I had two bottles of wine amongst friends and they both were smooth and delicious. I ordered the cheese and meat plate. Absolutely delicious! For dinner, I ordered the roasted grouper with lemon risotto and vegetables. I have been trying different seafood to see what I like and do not like. The grouper has made my \"delicious\" list thanks to cork and barrel. Try it! The waitress was very friendly and personable. The atmosphere is quaint and perfect for dates or gatherings with friends. I hear that there is a patio (can't wait to try it during the summer months). Try cork and barrel. You won't be disappointed :-)"}
{"text":"Outstanding addition to Avon! This is going to be our new favorite spot.
Manuel, our bartender (and I think, owner), is wildly knowledgeable and personable.  Service was as exceptional as the wine offerings!  Added bonus, food is on point.  We enjoyed the featured Spanish wine flight and mushroom flatbread. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"We stopped by the Cork and Barrel for happy hour and had a great experience. The sommelier made custom wine flights for us and was very knowledgeable. The cheese fondue appetizer was great too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the type of place that could be a goldmine if only they let that chef loose to create a real bistro menu. Tappas, shared plates and an inviting warm atmosphere. It just feels a bit cold.  
Tou can definitely tell the chef has talent but food lacks somehow, maybe its management or the older clientele."}
{"text":"Amazing place, food and service.  Great specials and very welcoming atmosphere.  Every soup is so memorable; great flavor and portions."}
{"text":"When my girl friend recommended this place for happy hour, I was on the fence. What a great surprise! I never stopped in when it was a Tea House (I think that's what it was before) but figured we would give it a try since it became a wine bar. I think it was a wonderful idea to make this place a wine bar! The Avon/Avon Lake area doesn't have a good quaint wine bar. I always said \"Ugh, I wish there was a cozy wine bar in the area\" and now there is! 

We did their wine flights and the recommendations from the woman working were great! I really enjoyed all of the wines and to my surprise the one I was most on the fence about ended up being my favorite. We also tried their Ohio Brussels which were mouth-watering! They are crispy brussels tossed with balsamic, Parmesan and black walnuts....you must try these! And we also tried the Warm Hummus Skillet that was really good as well. 

This place is so absolutely adorable - - modern, sophisticated and just what I've been looking for!"}
{"text":"First time visit. First and foremost, Martha was an amazing server. The menu is delicious and well priced. We will be back many many times."}
{"text":"What a hidden treasure in Avon. Amazing staff, knowledgeable wine steward and delicious food. The wine flight I was served was amazing. It was delicious wines. The dates and the featured flat bread was delicious. Look forward to going back and checking out the Australian Wine tasting on 2/22."}
