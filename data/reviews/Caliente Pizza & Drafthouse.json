{"text":"This place is shit. I have given them every chance, but they can't help but screw nearly everything up. One topping pizzas with the wrong topping, online pickup orders that they never seem to receive, inconsistent quality of food, poor to middling staff service, and an unreasonably high price point for almost all of their products. I rarely write reviews, and almost never speak poorly of restaurant staff due to the demanding and often unappreciated nature of the work, but this place has earned my ire after repeated and unrepentant failure at the simplest of service. Unless you are simply having a happy hour beer or two, your money is best spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"First I'd like to say that Nick and Angie have done a tremendous job bringing great beer to the burgh...this was my go to for one of kind, can't get anywhere else beer.  Sadly, I noticed a trend of serving beers under 7% in snifters a few months ago.  $7 or 8 for 10oz of a beer I can get anywhere else in a pint is just a little presumptous and overpriced. If you look at their draft list, there are few beers than make it into a pint glass now.  Snifters and tulips seem to be the norm. I'm sad to say I've stopped going to Caliente because of this.  While I love what they bring to the table and their pizza is really good...I can go elsewhere and spend less, and have the same experience and beer now.  I'd suggest happy hour if you want to try it out.  Half priced drafts from 430-630pm."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews I was apprehensive to try the Bloomfield location for dine in. But the pizza was delicious, and the server attentive. I'm not sure what all these nightmare reviews have experienced. But for dinner on a Saturday at 7:30, we were well attended and well fed. We loved the 9 cut square pan style pizza. My boyfriend also would like to note that contrary to one reviewer's feedback, the men's bathroom was perfectly normal."}
{"text":"I live in the area and enjoy pizza and craft beer so I eat here about once a month. They have good pizza and beer and the service is good as well. The greasy slippery floor is a lawsuit waiting to happen so I hope they address this before someone really injures themself."}
{"text":"Best pizza in pittsburgh hands down.  Not only that, but the prices are less than most competitors."}
{"text":"Slow to great when you sit at the bar. Not very friendly. Food took forever. Draft Beer selection is good. Only had three drafts available for growler refill. Overall not impressed"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and normally it's not to bad this time around I got food my order was all wrong .. I ordered boneless wings and got traditional wings that were undercooked pretty badly and they forgot my ranch(which is minor) ... The pizza however was very good... It was a late night order but that doesn't mean the quality should go down hill...basically it was 40 dollars down the drain!"}
{"text":"Probaly had the worst experience I've ever had being waited on. Now i know the bartender had to wait tables and serve drinks at the same time but she was old and slow and was to busy yapping away complaining about her coworkers from the night before...the food was decent...but like i said the service was some of the worst ever...waited a good half hour just to get my water refilled..i s and my at at a table with my roomate after waiting a good 20mins for a refill of drinks i went up to the bar and was ignored and than my roommate tried and was shown the same horrible service like i said before because she was yapping away..place was busy but managable...i don't work in the food service industry so I'm not an expert..but i know whenpeople suck at what they do..only reason i will be back is cause some of the other bartenders are hot lol"}
{"text":"They have great pizza and the best beer selection in Bloomfield...but that's about all. I've had experiences with the staff ranging from \"alright\" to downright bad. Today the staff experience was an exception (in the beginning), but rest of the visit left me with a sour taste. Decided to stop in for a quick burger and a beer before meeting up with friends. Ordered a beer and a cheeseburger from the very nice female bartender. I sipped my beer, so as to make it last until I was able to enjoy it with my burger...then 30 minutes went by. The cheeseburger finally arrived overcooked and under-cheesed. It was basically boiled meat on a deli bun, no juice at all. By this time, the nice female bartender had been replaced by a man who was very curt with his customers. No, I'm not mistaking busy for curt. The gentleman who sat next to me asked what was good on tap and he just turned away and said \"all of it's good.\"  I was hoping this could be my go-to place for a quick bite and a brew, as I live just 2 blocks away. Turns out stopping in for a quick bite is actually an hour commitment. I'll probably go back for the pizza, but that would be about it."}
{"text":"Ordered a buffalo chicken hoagie, worst chicken I've ever eaten in my entire life it was like the chicken been sitting out for months. Also had a half of steak hoagie the steak was hard and looked like gyro meat the fries on the hoagies were so soggy and it was unbelievable. Food went down hill incredibly me and my girlfriend couldn't even finish over hoagies. Not to mention how over priced it was. I'm very disappointed I spent $32 for us not even be able to eat will not be ordering from here ever again"}
{"text":"Tonight was the second time we've ordered delivery from them and they've charged us and never delivered the food. When we called two hours later, they said they'd remake the food or refund us the money, but not both. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"The ingredients are fresh and good but i always have to throw the pizza in the oven because it is never fully cooked, get your stuff together guys, your pizza would be good if it was cooked right! Cant comment about anything else."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, great service and an extensive list of beers on draft. A great place to take friends or even just for happy hour. Really a fan of their delivery as you can also have beer delivered!"}
{"text":"It's really unfortunate that the service at this place sucks so much, because I really like the beer selection and the food is decent as well. But every time I'm in there, they are incredibly understaffed. Once, my friend and I sat at the bar for 15 minutes without a drink! It was ridiculous. And once you order food, you're really in for the long haul..."}
{"text":"Had takeout today at Children's Hospital.  Delicious cheese with riccotta."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had an incredibly poor experience at Caliente Pizza & Draft House. We went to the Allison Park location and ordered a medium cheese pizza, half pepperoni, and an order of spinach rolls. The spinach rolls smelled amazing, but were full of raw dough on the inside. The pizza was so burnt that it was black and they forgot the half pepperoni. We placed our order as pickup. There is no clear systems for picking up the food at this location. The employees were clearly stressed and disorganized and projected that on the customer via a bad attitude. Even if we had been able to eat our order, I would have called it overpriced. The entire restaurant is chaos and I would not recommend."}
{"text":"So the fact that caliente is open until 2am is BEYOND amazing. The fact that every time I order they forget thing ranch or buffalo sauce that I pay 2.00 extra for less than amazing. I just have never hit a home run when it comes to delivery here. I am always disappointed and kept waiting for over an hour. The food is usually good. It's just never served the way you pay extra for. Kept that in mind when ordering delivery."}
{"text":"Pizza is fantastic... excellent crunchy crust and tangy sauce. Generous with their toppings. Salads were good except for the  plastic utensils to eat it with in house. No iced tea or coffee was available either."}
{"text":"The staff is wonderful and the food is great!  I held an event at the Mt Lebonan location (brand new mind you!!) this afternoon and my guests raved about the great food.  The house made ranch dressing is the best!  Wings are crispy and fresh, the hoagies are flavorful, and well...they do have The Worlds Best Pizza!  I can not wait to go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"I am giving Caliente one star because I can't give any less. This used to be a place I went to often when in Bloomfield. When it opened, it was a pizza place I could sit down at with my friends, after Doc's in Shadyside closed. However, in the last few years, I have been growing increasingly unhappy with Caliente. My last three experiences have sealed the deal that this establishment will never get my business again. About a month ago, I moved to Bloomfield after living in multiple neighborhoods in the city. Some friends and I went to celebrate the move over happy hour. The three of us ordered a round of beers, pepperoni rolls, a dozen wings, and an order fries. We waited an hour for our food (please note, this was at around 3:30pm and with very few other patrons in the building). All of our food came out together despite the pepperoni rolls being requested as the appetizer. In the two hours we were there, we ordered one more round (not without trying to order more) and our checks.  The second experience was my friend and I ordering pizza for delivery. A simple cheese pizza. The pizza was paid for, but it never came. She was offered a free pizza when she went in to complain the next day, but the damage had been done. The third and final straw was a few days ago. My boyfriend and I went in to grab an easy and seemingly quick meal. We ordered breadsticks, pepperoni rolls, 1/2 boneless wings with fries, and a fish sandwich. Within 20 minutes, the pepperoni rolls and wings came. The waitress admitted that she forgot to put in the fries. I declined to wait for them. She, also, promised that my boyfriend's breadsticks and fish sandwich would be out soon. I made the decision to wait until his food came so we could eat together. We saw two tables of 3/4, that sat down after us, get their full pizzas for each person before our entire meal. After 45 minutes, we began debating our options. My boyfriend has worked in the service industry for over a decade, so it takes a lot for him to negatively speak about a place while in it. While we were non-verbally discussing things, his food finally came. The breadsticks looked like they gave up and just tried to get the food out. They were of various sizes and shapes. Just dough thrown together in a vertical way to be baked. Our waitress gave us a discount on our meal, but the damage was done. We paid and left. When we were walking home, we saw four cooks standing outside bullshitting. I have no problem with breaks, but with four cooks, they should not have been that backed up. Additionally, the service is usually what holds Caliente back, but in my last experience, the flavor was not there. I will not be back. Sorry, Caliente - it's been real."}
{"text":"Eaten here before and A+. Last night a friend moved back to Pittsburgh and took her out for drinks. We started at Pleasure Bar in Bloomfield...thats another story! :-( Decided to try out Caliente's. Wasnt that busy but that was good. Ordered a rum runner and Jeff,the bartender, never made one. No biggie. White russian and my friend said make me something with tequila in it. She loved it! We ended calling it The Jeff Drink.(think of something catchier later) he seemed to be there solo and held his ground, calm,collected, and really nice.  Ordered provie sticks and chicken poppers, and they were out in minutes and were great, (for fried food) we have now officialy made it our meeting place and Italian days is coming up and surely will bring the gang down here!"}
{"text":"EXTREMELY HIGH PRICED BEERS.ATLEAST 2X AS MUCH. good beers. good pizza . good calzones. good food in general. but beers are priced atleast 2X the price of anywhere else you will find good beers. go to lot 17 across the street. not as many any beers on tap but priced right and really awesome people working. or just go buy a case next door at the distributor. sucks but true. like you caliente but you are ripping us off. i paid $9 dollars for a dogfish draft. good beer. but seriously? im emailing dogfish too to confirm how excessive this is. At least have the decency to display your prices so your customers have the option I walk out before ordering. But I guess that's part of the plan because no one would stay if you did. And I have heard this complaint from everyone I know who has got sucked into Caliente."}
{"text":"After my two very different dining experiences at Caliente, I believe that I have a fair picture of the establishment. If you're thinking about trying Caliente, my advice is to avoid ordering takeout or delivery at all costs, and always opt for dining in.   Why not delivery, you ask? I tried ordering a pizza for delivery around 7pm on a Friday night before going out with some friends. The delivery was sent to my friend's apartment, which was only a few blocks away from the restaurant's Bloomfield location. Understandably, I expected a considerable wait due to the fact that it was during a busy time: the estimated delivery time was 30 minutes. However, I was disappointed when after an hour the delivery was nowhere to be found. Not only was I frustrated, but my friends were too because this pizza was holding up our plans. When I attempted calling the restaurant, I was told the order was \"on its way\" and that the driver was very busy. After another 45 minutes, I called again and got the same response. Everyone was getting more and more impatient, and I was wondering if it wasn't too late to cancel the order. When the pizza finally arrived over 2 hours later, it was room temperature- although I have to admit it was delicious despite the fact. The delivery took over four times longer than expected, which ruined the plans for the night.   I was willing to give Caliente another chance, so recently I went to the restaurant with a group of friends late on a Saturday night, around 1am. The experience was much more positive, because the food was ready in a reasonable time, even though my party was quite large. The pizza was fresh out of the oven and was fantastic. Our server was friendly. So if you want fresh, tasty pizza, please go to their restaurant- I highly recommend it for a late night snack! Just learn from my mistakes, and don't order delivery."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this a \"meh\" because, while the hot wings were quite good, the delivery person just left the food sitting on my front porch.  He didn't knock on the door or call the number we provided; just left it there by the door.  Fortunately I had heard my gate slam and went to check it out, but if I hadn't, it would have been sitting there for who knows how long.  Totally unacceptable from a food-delivery establishment."}
{"text":"We ordered boneless hot wings and pizza through UberEats. The wings were delivered raw. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Some of the BEST pizza in the area. You can get cheaper but this pizza is quality. Good for delivery but the restaurant/bar is nice as well. I've never had any problems other than it being filled with typical Bloomfield guys who sometimes make it awkward to be a female at a bar. The staff is nice though and again, the pizza in superb."}
{"text":"Like this little place a whole bunch!! Always interesting and unique beers. And, although we've never done anything else, the pizza is honest and well prepared. Not sure why they don't rate better in the \"best of\" rankings. This is a simple neighborhood bar with friendly staff and reliable food. Can be a bit noisy and crowded. But if you get here early and stay through \"the game\", you're sure to have a good time!!"}
{"text":"Live in Bloomfield and have been here many times: Good:  1. Salads and cheesy bread are consistently good. Also the cheesy bread is enormous and costs less than a draft beer. Since it comes with marinara sauce, the cheesy bread is a cost effective hack for a medium pizza. Homemade balsamic vinaigrette is also solid. 2. Nice variety of craft beers... Both draft and bottle, which is self-serve. They also change the draft beers frequently. They even host events where breweries from throughout the country come up and do keg-tappings. 3. Lots of televisions... Good place to watch sporting events. Bad: 1. Service is consistently bad. Slow service. Inattentive service. Obscenely long waits to get food. Etc. Don't come here expecting a quicker meal.  2. Although they have a good, rotating variety of draft beers, the majority of them (at least as of the last couple times I'd been there) have a higher ABV and are served in small glasses like tulips or snifters. I'm not anti-high ABV but it would be nice to have some craft beers that are not as strong, served by the pint. Even some beers that have more normal 5-6.5 ABVs are served in smaller ounce glasses but still are charged as if they were served by the pint. Kinda seems like price-gouging. Indifferent: 1. Ambience is dark even during the middle of day. One large front window is tinted and all the walls are black; however, there is a lot of cool brewery memorabilia on the walls. 2. They have a downstairs bar that features some different drafts. Never been."}
{"text":"Over priced! Over crowded! The service was so slow but I don't blame the wait staff. They were so over worked. There is no way the small staff could keep up with all the people. Not at all what we expect. We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza to take out at 5:02, was told it would be ready in 25 minutes. Arrived at 5:35 and was told pizza was not ready....its 550 and my pizza arries, no apology or acknowledgement of delay  This is pretty typical for this place. It has consistently the worst service of any establishment I've ever been too. The bill is frequently incorrect and once our waitress was fired or quit in the middle of serving us.  I've still be a monthly customer for 3 years as the pizza is pretty good and the beer is tasty but about 50% marked up as most beers come in 8-12oz servings. It anywhere else in Bloomfield has better pizza and beer this place would be long gone."}
{"text":"If you enjoy fingernails in your food this is the place for you.. when I brought it to the attention of the owner I was told that it was impossible for a fingernail to be in my pizza.. however I watched my daughter pull that gross fingernail out of her mouth. You might ask yourself what the owner did to compensate me??? Nothing, they offered me nothing then a month later he lied to my face and said I turned down a half off coupon... Do yourself a favor and order from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Nice place. Great pizza. Good beer (except Sept-Oct when all they have is pumpkin beer or Oktoberfest) BUT....their floor is always SLIPPERY AF. It's not wet, it's just a regular wood floor that is inexplicably slippery. Wear sturdy shoes...or a helmet."}
{"text":"Wait staff very knowledgeable on beer selection, even offers small glass to taste different beers . Now I order the supreme pizza and its was very good I hate to say this probably the best in the city . Caliente was running a special with Brooklyn beer order a beer and get a glass really cool look for specials every Friday . Recommend for the beer and food selection"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  I ride past this place daily and never stopped to try anything...well that was short lived. I visited Caliente's twice in one week! Service was prompt, food was fresh! Keep up the good work, Caliente!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery. Cold pizza and zucchini fries. Had to put it in the microwave.  It took 2 hours to get to our apartment 1.5 miles away from the restaurant. The manager did not make any offers to right the wrong.  Did not seem phased. Must hear this from customers regularly.  will not return."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, this place keeps its kitchen open til 2AM, and I appreciate it, but they don't have a single inexpensive, decent beer on tap, their bottles are over-priced, and you pay for the kitchen's extra hours. Pizza is good--a three and a half star pie. The yeungling battered fish sandwich is really good, maybe even five star, but you'd want to pay about $1.50 less for it from a bar with a slighlty less corporate/chain atmosphere. Applebee's isn't the standard people!"}
{"text":"I went on Thursday and it was 7 dollar medium cheese. Coming from Chicago I was skeptical but the pizza was delicious. The crust was good and it was even good cold later. The waitress was really nice. The only problem was the rif raf that came in. Crowd was somewhat trashy. I would go back if I was in Pitt again."}
{"text":"Alright, I have to level with you - I'm giving Caliente a 5 star rating, but it's for a combo of above-average 'bar food' AND the fastest delivery in Bloomfield, hands-down. (Who enjoys waiting an hour and a half for food?! When ya hungry, ya hungry!)  Thus far, I've sampled: chicken tenders (delish), popcorn chicken (okay, but more crispy breading than meat), onion rings (the best!), white pizza (solid, not as good as Angelo's, but you can add ricotta), regular pizza (good), mozzarella sticks (decent), chicken parm with pasta (the chicken is diced up and kinda mixed with the pasta, which is different, but still good), and -- duhn, duhn, duhhhn -- the gyro.   I have to elaborate on this one, because I was kinda shocked by how good their gyro was! They toast the pita, so it has a satisfying crunch to it, which I appreciate. They deliver it with the cucumber sauce (decent, but not Mike & Tony's) on the side so ish doesn't get soggy -- a plus in my book -- and the right amount of lettuce, tomato, and red onion comes on the luscious lamb. We've ordered the gyro about five times now, and have never been disappointed!   On top of all that, the food is usually delivered within 20-30 minutes. How awesome is that? I mean, when you call and order delivery, it's because you are hungry and, in my case, too lazy to put shoes on and drive to Wendy's. Caliente always comes through for me here. In fact, last night, they delivered our food in FIFTEEN minutes! That's cray-cray. Unheard of. Usually, food delivery peeps seem to like to flaunt their power over you. \"You're hungry? We have food. Yeah, you want our food?... Well, ya gotta wait!\" Not Caliente. They're quick, pleasant, and they take credit cards over the phone, so you don't have to have cash either. :)"}
{"text":"I've been sat at the bar with three friends, trying to get the attention of one of the three bartenders so I can get another drink. My boyfriend had to order my beer and food because the one blonde girl with the ponytail has basically has ignored me the entire night. I've been in here once, wasn't rowdy or rude (I also bartend. I'm not a dick to people in the service industry) and I think I tipped well- so why am I not acknowledged? Also she just closed us out and reached over me to give him the check (again, completely ignored) even though I've had an empty glass in front of me for the last 20 minutes. I guess I won't be getting another beer then :( My experience was much better last time I was here: I really liked this place. Caliente sort your staff out."}
{"text":"Normally the pizza was ready in a timely manner. However today I went in 30 minutes as requested. The pizza hadn't even been put in the oven. Now I am waiting for them to deliver it. It has been 90 min since the order was placed."}
{"text":"Ordered from Caliente on a weeknight, and it took an hour and a half to get the pizza.  When we finally got the pizza it was cold.  I was hopeful that after waiting so long the pizza would be worth the wait but was left disappointed.  The toppings were decent but the dough tasted just like the big chains.    Bottom line - if you want a passable pizza delivered ice cold in two hours this is your place, otherwise you are better off going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hands down best beer selection in Pittsburgh.  Can be pricy for drafts but from 430-630 all drafts ate half off making them more than reasonable.  Also have at least one beer or brewery on special each day.  The pizza here is pretty good but definitely not my favorite in the city.  Haven't tried much else on the food menu other than the burger which was decent.  If you're into craft beer though you HAVE to give callientes a try.  They make it a point to carry the best selection of bottles and drafts including hard to find brews from across the country.  I have come hear for several special tappings (Canadian breakfast stout, bourbon county stout, etc...) and the events have always been well run and gone smoothly.  Also they have a recently renovated downstairs bar which is open on busy nights and is great!"}
{"text":"If you think you'll be hungry in 2 hours then you should order from here.  I think the food was decent but it was so cold by the time I got it that I really wasn't sure.  I placed an order, 1 large pizza and am order of jalapeño poppers...an hour and forty five minutes later I called just to learn that they were \"about to leave\".  Fifteen minutes later my food was delivered after having plenty of time to cool off."}
{"text":"I can't speak for their famous pizza as I, nor anyone in my group had one.  I can speak for their fries, which are a bit of a mixed bag. Some were damn near perfect, deliciously golden brown.  Others were soggy and undercooked. Which I find odd, as the food took quite some time to reach out table.  Overall I would return, but I'm in no rush."}
{"text":"Love their happy hours (4:30-6:30, half off most drafts, $5 personal pizzas)-- incredible draft selection, especially for those of us who love IPAs & stouts, and the best pizza I've had yet in Pittsburgh. Delivery can sometimes take a little long but it's totally worth it for their pizza."}
{"text":"The happy hour specials are what it's all about. Half priced drafts of very great beers and the $5 personal pizzas are grand. After happy hour there are usually some other great specials that start at 7:00.   My only qualm is the normal draft prices and the prices on toppings for pizzas (spinach in particular). In my opinion, soggy canned spinach should not be a \"premium fresh\" topping that costs close to $5 to be tossed onto a pie.   In summary, check the online draft list and if you see something intriguing, head there for happy hour."}
{"text":"The beer menu is the high point of this little spot in Bloomfield. The food was bar food so don't expect much, though after a round or two it's pretty good. Try to go on nights when it's slow because this place is fairly small and in a popular neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is terrible & ran by a bunch of morons. I complained on their facebook page about them not getting an order right. Instead of accepting my feedback, I got blocked from writing on their page. Haha. Ordered tonight, prior to knowing that and its well after the delivery time frame with no sign of my food. The food in general is average. Their pizza is ok, not really worth an award. The broccoli puffs are amazing.  Every time I have ordered there have been issues. Every time I have ordered delivery, they estimate it at 45 minutes and I end up getting my food ice cold an hour and a half to two hours later. We ordered salads for PICKUP. Went in 20 minutes after ordering and they weren't ready. It'll only be a few minutes. 30 minutes later we got our salads. Manager offered a credit for next time we order and when we went back to use it he didn't remember us. Eventually gave us the credit after some teeth pulling.   Needless to say I haven't ordered there since. Plenty of other options around the Bloomfield area."}
{"text":"I went to get a pizza for take and was generally ignored while trying to give my name to the waitress to see if my order was ready.  When it did come out there was a hoagie with it which I did not order.  I tried to say something but she basically tossed the pizza at me and then walked away while ignoring my \"excuse me\"n attempts.  I tried to follow her and it was like she was rushing away from me.  She went back behind the bar and just starting playing with her phone while I had to yell MISS!  Then she tried to take my pizza away and I had to tell her I didn't order the hoagie.  I handed it to her and she just tossed it on the counter and said she didn't know who's it was.  Then when I got home my pizza was cold...not just warm...cold.  I won't be back and I feel bad for whoever's hoagie that was."}
{"text":"Took a pizza risk and decided to try this place despite poor reviews regarding service. Can't really say much about the pizza since we were never seated. After waiting for nearly 10 minutes without a server even looking at us, we patiently waited a little longer before we gave up. There are many pizza places in town so we decided to take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"First two or three times last summer were amazing. After that, mixed at best for both food and service, and so I had to branch out for my late night eats. Last time I called to see if they had a certain beer for to-go, and apparently it's much too far from the kitchen -- where the phone is -- to find out"}
{"text":"What a horrible experience.  Caliente employees should have enough respect for all patrons to at least wait on them professionally.  The food is great, the service on 3/3 was horrible.    Miss OJ's."}
{"text":"The pan pizza is tasty... and that's the only reason I dined there 3 times, but the third time will be the last, at least for a while. Other than the pizza positive, there are negatives that point to an utter lack of management attention.  First, in each of the three times I've gone there, the bar has been covered with empty glasses, used napkins and plates, and crumbs from the previous customers.  Bartenders/barbacks:  get it together.   Second, plastic plates and plastic silverware.  Seriously?  Is this an outdoor picnic?  Not only is it insulting to your customers, but it also generates an unecessary amount of plastic waste.  Owner/manager:  get some class and treat your customers better.  Third, in each of the three times I've gone there, the men's bathroom has been out of soap.  Each time there has been THE SAME nearly-empty dispenser of Dial antibacterial lotion (not soap) with some water added into it in a very weak attempt to cover the fact that there is no soap in the bathroom.  You're operating as a restaurant.  Is it really so hard to have soap in a bathroom?   Owner/manager:  What's wrong with you?"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for the most part. There pizzas are excellent. My favorite is the buffalo pizza and I highly recommend it. The only complaints I have is that there is not enough seating because it's a small confined building. Sometimes the servers are slow on checking our needs but we are understanding. We frequent this place often and never had a bad meal and it's a meal that is enjoyable."}
{"text":"Pizza and appetizers are pretty nice. Beer selection seemed OK, but not particularly vast. They had one poor bastard working there on the Sunday night before Memorial Day and it was like one of the only places open on the street. One person at the bar and doing table service for food. Service was predictably, cripplingly slow. Assuming this was a one off because of the holiday weekend I would give this place another try. The patrons having shouting matches outside also provided nice, light evening entertainment."}
{"text":"Great local 'go-to' spot for a beer especially during happy hour.  THE best beer selection I've seen around especially if you like to try variety of beers.  Bartenders are always friendly but definitely need help if the place is busy.   The pizza is great and the fries and some appetizers are good but beyond that is a bit of a waste.  Especially the buffalo chicken sandwich..don't waste your money.  It is truly a PIZZA AND DRAFT place.    One of the only places around that will serve food until 2am however!"}
{"text":"This place is DEAD. New owners who hate punks, gays and weirdos. They are trying to turn it into a south side frat bar. Nothing but dinguses working and hanging out here now. Avoid at all costs. You guys ruined a great spot."}
{"text":"I wanted beer and pizza one night and this place was recommended by a friend. I will never go back there. My beer was warm. My waiter couldn't give me any advice about their beer list and the pizza was burnt. Nothing worse than burnt cheese and pepperoni. We had also ordered loaded fries which were just okay, however, our order for them came after we had finished half the pizza. When I asked the man who brought us our pizza he said in a really defensive way that he was simply the pizza guy and didn't know a thing about the fries. I would not recommend this place. Ever. Bad food. Bad service."}
{"text":"Super rude driver at 12pm on 7/15. I doubt you were 'calling me six times' since I was on top of my phone bc I was starving sir. Let's not try to make excuses- this restaurant is under a mile away. *cold pizza* *thanks for just waiting in your car* *come to the door sir*"}
{"text":"I'm so in love with Calientes. I go there at least once a month, and I brought so many friends there. Try their pizza rolls or their pepperoni cheesy bread sticks. Their supreme pizza is great too. it's all great. Best pizza place in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"My rating is based on service! I have ordered from here multiple times, but this might be my last. My past experiences with ordering via phone and the food typically are tremendous! I decided to give the grub hub ordering method a shot, it started with great hope! But after 65 minutes of waiting, 20 past the reported delivery time I gave them a call. Found out there was a computer issue and did not get my order immediately, which they knew why I was calling! So total wait time turned out to be about 90 minutes. Still excited about the pizza only to become disappointed that the pizza dough was partially cook and raw..."}
{"text":"As many of the other reviews state, this isn't in reference to the food at Caliente because that's always awesome. Every time I go, the service is absolutely atrocious but I always want to give it another chance. I am posting this from the bar of Lot 17 as I just left Caliente after I sat at the bar where there were only 3 other people. Multiple bartenders walked past me more than once not even acknowledging that I was sitting there. I gave it 10 minutes until I decided to leave, even as I was getting up from the barstool, a bartender walked past me without a care in the world. I wish I could recall the name of one of the bartenders that works there because she is great, I remember her telling me she just recently moved here from Florida... Have her back there all the time and maybe you won't get these reviews!"}
{"text":"Had to give it another try. Big mistake. The waitress acted like we were a bother to her (there was one other table; it was no where near closing time). She was rude from the minute we sat down until we left even after many attempts to \"kill her with kindness.\"  What is the point of having \"the best craft beer list\" if your staff knows nothing about the beer, serves it in the wrong glass, and the glass they do serve it in reeks of  bleach and is filthy?  I won't be returning and I'd advise others to stay away."}
{"text":"Hello, How things have changed. This place USED to be the place for pizza and beers. Stopped by there tonight, it was at least 90 degrees inside. Oh well, benefit of the doubt, things go wrong. Ordered a pepperoni pizza to go (because it was 100 degrees in there) , got home NO PEPPERONi! Great end to a night. I guess when you are able to expand you forget who got you there. By the way the bartenders and waitstaff attempted to keep the customer happy despite the fact that they were melting."}
{"text":"The rating is a simple choice: ordered one medium pizza for delivery at a late hour, waited 1.5 hours and it never came. Worse, I called twice to inquire and this still happened. genuinely confused at this experience. I was traveling, staying at a hotel, and this was my dinner. By the time I realized they didn't care enough to deliver it, it was late enough where I couldn't order from anywhere else, and I was up later than I would've liked. Went to bed hungry, and very upset."}
{"text":"Caliente's is the best pizza I've had in town. Maybe not as celebrated as some others, but you get a great pie here. The wings are very good too. Subs are just meh, but hopefully that's not why you've come to a place with \"Pizza\" in the title."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, good service and terrific pizza!   We had the bourbon maple bacon wings which were awesome and the meat lovers  pizza.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Caliente is my favorite place to get pizza! It seems to cost a little more upfront than other local pizza shops, however, it's always a good quality pizza! The buffalo chicken pizza is fantastic as well as their traditional pizzas with red sauce. There's a ton of options, and they give you your money's worth."}
{"text":"I had their pizza for the first time last week, and was back for more today. Fresh pizza dough and ingrediants. I got my for take out and it smelled so good and fresh I couldn't wait to get home to eat it. It was really delicious ! The crust was amazing, and sauce was perfect. I can't wait to take friends there to eat. I would like to give a huge compliment to the bartender/server Victoria. She was The Best ! She is another reason why I will be back. She was such a pleasure to deal with , enthusiastic, and has a lot of knowledge of the food/ beers. I watched her dealing with other customers too , and Calientes has someone VERY SPECIAL !!!! I'm looking forward to trying other foods they serve besides their fantastic pizza. Go there to eat, and if your a beer drinker there is a big selection, and have Victoria is there to help you make a selection. Great food and staff !"}
{"text":"The pizza is by far one of the best in the city and some of the best I've had period. However, as a regular customer (though it's soon to be former), the delivery takes anywhere from an hour and fifteen minutes to an hour and a half and by then the pizza is lukewarm and has to be thrown in the oven.   There's a million other pizza places in Bloomfield."}
{"text":"Never been inside but got delivery from here before.  We got one Hawaiian and one sausage jalapenos.  The pizza was definitely decent but honestly just reminded me of a normal chain restaurant.  Nothing special so far but I'll have to eat in and see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"For the record, me and the girlfriend WANT to love this place, but after 2 visits over the past couple weeks, it is simply in our \"okay\" column. Why?  Well, first, let me say that Caliente's hits 2 of our 3 metrics for becoming a fan favorite: beer selection and food quality. Both times we've been to Caliente's the pizza, wings and fries have been pretty good to great. And the beer selection is perfect for microbrew worshipers like ourselves, with bottles, cans AND drafts galore. However, they score low in our 3rd metric of service. Not that the service is rude or absolutely terrible. It is just not good. It is the slow, lack of attention and detail that irks us. We tip well and we demand more attentive service. First trip we sat at the bar. The guy there was nice enough, but several times he passed us when we had empty drinks and twice we asked him for things like a glass of water and we actually saw him start to get it, but get sidetracked talking to coworkers and regulars and remember after 5 minutes when he came back to our part of the bar. Last night, we were inadvertently charged for an item we \"won\" on their Facebook page. And the waitress went out to smoke while our empty water glasses remained at full attention in the end if our table...in the dining room area with no one else there. I'm starting to wonder if this is why the place seems empty on weekend nights. This place is so close to being a contender...the service just needs to pick up before we will come back again."}
{"text":"Caliente is my new favorite happy hour spot.  They have a great selection of craft beers that is constantly changing.  During usual times the beer can get a bit pricey but all craft beers are half off for happy hour and its the perfect place and time to try out new things.  The staff are attentive and friendly and their pizza is also good.  But as far as craft beers go, it's the best place to get a wide selection in the area and youll never get tired of the same old thing because it is always changing."}
{"text":"I have bee nmeaning to review Caliente for a long time now. I has been my boozer of choice since I moved to Bloomfield almost a year and a half ago. It was actually one of the first local businesses I patronized following my move.  The bar is small. A few seats and tables with a larger raised section at the back. The space is small and the bodies pack in during peak hours. The big focal point, besides the myriad of beer signs from over a hundred different breweries from around the nation and globe, are the chalk walls. The first holds the draft list and usually a cool piece of seasonal chalk art. The back wall has a very VERY cool piece of chalk art depicting the storefront and surrounding buildings on Liberty Ave.  The service is usually top notch. I tend to go on Tuesdays (cause I am a secret karaoke whore) and see Angie. Angie is a peach. Always quick with a smile and a drink. On a side note she was also first runner up for a best bartender in the Burgh competition this past year. There is a small downside though. The management seems to never schedule an appropriate amount of staff, so during volume you can face a bit of a wait, unless you become a regular, then you get taken care of.  The food here is bombtastic to boot. Pizzas are incredible, my favorite being the spinach and feta. My all time favorite item on the menu is the Italian Sub. The col cuts are great, the cheese is awesome, the veggies are fresh and crisp and it is all contained by a chewy crusty sub roll. Also, kitchen is open till 2 so big plus for me.  The biggest reason I love Caliente is their beer selection. To have one of the biggest and most eclectic selections in all of Pittsburgh and literal stumble (long story involving way too much North Coast Old Rasputin and Fireball) from my front door is truly a double edged sword. The bar features about 20 constantly rotating taps with the worst beer being Yuengling. They also have a very nice bottle selection to boot. The beers come in appropriate glassware, which is unique. Most bars have pints and maybe snifters but Caliente had pislners, snifters, tulips, and goblets. The only drawback is that I find the drafts to be a little over priced.  Like the Toby Keith song, I love this bar. It is quick, convenient, and fun. It only loses a star for being a hair overpriced and understaffed. Neither of these will keep me from going back again and again."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent visitor there.  The good:  - When they make the pizza right, it's top notch. No real complaints when its done right. That's why we go there. Like a lot of home made places though, they have their off nights.  - Chicken wings are good and the meal-a-tizers(aka appetizers...more on that below) are pretty good as a whole.  The bad:  - They have meal-a-tizers, not appetizers. Your appetizers likely won't come before you get your main meal, but after it. Sometimes it even comes at the same time. The whole point of apps are to get food for while you are waiting.  - Their men's bathroom is one of the worst bathrooms ever. Very very small and cramped.  - Can be a little pricey. XL pizza's got their prices raised $3 recently with no real explanation given and no increase in quality.  Parking is on street and they do deliver."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying we've only had their pizza. The pizza is sub par, definitely not worth the price. We later tried order from Caliente solely based on the fact that they were open (this was more than a half hour before they closed). After an hour of not receiving our order we called to check on the status. We were assured that it was about to be delivered. 25 minutes later we called after not receiving our pizza only to find that nobody was there to answer. Long story short, we never got our pizza, Grubhub refunded the order (they are great). I will likely never order or visit this place again. Buyer beware..."}
{"text":"Caliente - YES PLEASE!  Grrreat pizza, even grrreater beer, who can ask for more?!?!  My partner and I typically get their regular crust, cheese pizza.  The last visit we tried the square, thick crust.  We even splurged for the 5-cheese specialty topping.  I will NEVER order anything but at Caliente again!  Yeah, a bit pricey, but totally worth it.  Then, the beer.  They have a ton of great, local beers on tap, as well as other not-so-local.  Caliente typically plays a large part in Pittsburgh Craft Beer week, which is really cool too.  I've immensely enjoyed the tap takeovers they've hosted as well.  Agree with some other reviewers that the service can sometimes be subpar.  Not that the staff isn't supremely nice, but the place is hard to navigate when crowded (which is often), and its not like the servers can make food cook any faster.  For how great the food I've had there is, I'm okay with taking down a few beers, chilling with my homies, and waiting a little extra time for a tasty pie."}
{"text":"Everyone in our house agrees, Caliente's pan pizza is the best pizza in the area. Plus, it's so much more than just a pizza shop. The atmosphere inside is great. Full bar with great beer selection, good music and friendly service. Great addition to Aspinwall."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza and beer on a Friday night!  Caliente's has a huge selection of draft and bottled beers. I was a little disappointed during my last visit as on draft they mostly had Dogfish Head which I believe was leftover from a special event they had. Also the bottled beer selection was pretty low.  This is not typical though and I was still able to try 2 new bottled beers including the Deschutes summer ale which had a nice light flavor.  Their pizza is delicious and we went with a  medium sized pie with chicken, bacon, tomato, and ranch dressing as well as a small Hawaiian pizza. Both had lots of fresh toppings and even a few slices left to take home.The prices are right but the service is slow- I was surprised by how many waiters and waitresses they had on a Friday night and still it took over 15-20 minutes to order and a long waits in between  beers."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about the pizza and beer for a while so I really wanted to try it. Let's start off with the beer. The selection is really good. We were there the week after PCBW and they were having their left over night. There were a bunch of oak aged selections which I loved. My big problem is their serving size. They sell many of their higher abv servings in baby size serving glasses. I find it tacky and insulting. Its a shady business tactic to serve less beer. I'm really disappointed in this practice and would not consider this a prime beer spot. I have never seen such a tiny serving glass.   The pizza was decent. There was nothing extraordinary about the food but it was fresh. We wanted to go and try their first place, pan pizza. We ordered this and a few of our friends ordered a different type of pizza. It took the staff 45 minutes to inform us that they were out of the pan pizza. Our fiends got their pizza 5 minutes later. So we had to wait longer and watch them eat.  We were there around 6pm so it's not a late dinner. Things can run out, but don't take so stinking long to tell us! As much as I want to try this special pan pizza, and compare it to a real Chicago style, I'm not sure if I care to go back."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. I ordered pizza at 6:30 to be ready by 7:30. It is 8:15 and I am still waiting. No staff have updated me or checked on me. Multiple people have walked in and out since I've walked in."}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing but the bartender/ waitress was the worst I have ever had.  She didn't like that a few Families came in together so she insisted we all pay on one check even though we each had our own table.  She asked if we were getting the special, since I didn't know what it was, I asked, she said in a rude tone \" you can read it on the wall behind you\". She obviously didn't want the business and made it very obvious.  She brought the items ordered and just placed them on the bar and yelled what was out.  We had to get our item each time.  This took close to an hour for everything.  A perfect example of a bad employee and how they can single handedly ruin a small business!  None of us will ever be back which is a shame because it was recommended so highly by a Bloomfield family and the food was good."}
{"text":"I've never been inside, but I've ordered a billion pizzas. They're all delicious. It can take a minute for delivery, but I've never been disappointed with a Caliente pizza, and that's all my rating needs to be. The missing star is to make room for whatever I might be missing about beer and the ambience inside -- sorry, guys."}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I've ever, ever had. Just completely unacceptable. We went for wing night on Monday and they had only one sever. We sat there for a good 20-25 minutes before we were even acknowledged. The server walked past us plenty of times to wait on her other tables and never said a word to us. I get it if you're busy but you could at least acknowledge us with something like a \"be right with you\". Nothing. Finally she comes over and is the most miserable person I've ever experienced. She was short with us and very rude and very inattentive. They had Yard bottles on special and when we asked what varieties they had she literally said to us, \"It's whatever bottles are on that top row of that cooler. It's a 'serve yourself' deal\" as she pointed annoyedly at the cooler. We walk up to the cooler to find they're completely out of all the yard bottles, which would have been nice for her to know before she charged them to our tab. Another customer was the one to tell us they had been out for awhile.. Brought us our wings with no ranches and one napkin each..really. It's wing night, we need napkins... The wings themselves were either over or undercooked. Some were hard and dry, some had pink in the middle. Surprised we didn't get sick. Caliente was never mind blowing but it was never this god awful. Never, ever again. I truly don't know how they stay in business if this is now their norm."}
{"text":"Terrible delivery service.  No, might not be enough.  1hr 50min delivery.  Pizza was cold, we had to put it in our own oven to heat it.  Celery is extra, two sticks of celery?  I hate writing this because I liked this place, absolutely won't be back."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend last night and was surprised by the experience that I had. First of all, if you're advertising your restaurant as a pizza place, you have to have great pizza.... bottom line. And unfortunately, I think that the pizza was the worst part of my entire experience here.  I walked in and sat down with a friend for dinner.I had a Groupon and was eager to use it- but I unfortunately had heard that this place was a little below par, so my expectations weren't very high. However, I was surprised, almost floored, at the variety and diversity of craft beers- good for you guys! The waiter, who was actually a really nice guy and great, offered to give me a taste of anything and I tried the chocolate stout- mmmmmhmmm. I ended up getting the night special of a 22oz average beer for either 4 or 5 bucks, but enjoyed the menu nonetheless.  And the food.... the food was actually pretty damn good. I had to spend 25 bucks for the Groupon, so we got a smorgasbord of bar food: onion rings, breadsticks, and a pizza. The waiter was even nice enough to come back and say we had enough money on the Groupon to get fries too- so we did just that (all of this for $25!) . The fries were average, but the onion rings and breadsticks were amazing. Good service, very little wait time. However, ironically the pizza left a lot to be desired.  Overall though, a tasty and fun little night. This place was a nice little hole in the wall in a small space right on Liberty, and I probably would go back again."}
{"text":"Their coupon for our new house paid off: they're our new go-to for delivery. Really excellent wings - we like the spicy Asian style- and pretty good pizza.  Update: not terribly impressed with ordering a pizza online at 6:30 with an ETA of 7:17 and not seeing it until 8:04. I understand things happen, but the lack of warning or an apology from either the shop when I called to inquire or the driver when he finally arrived definitely are not a way to communicate \"oops, sorry\"."}
{"text":"So I had been hearing about Caliente for awhile now (lived in PGH for about 5 years) and saw a Groupon so decided to give it a shot. I was not disappointed. The parking sucks, but that's every place in Bloomfield, and it was easy to find. My wife and me took our 3 kids and my only gripe is we had to wait about 45 minutes for a table, then again it was a Saturday night. The dining area should be way bigger. But the food was great. The breadsticks with homemade ranch were awesome and the Broccoli Puffs were amazing. We had a Pepperoni pizza and a Meat Lovers Pizza and they were both great. Good crust, lots of toppings. My wife had a Buffalo Chicken salad and she loved it. I would highly recommend Caliente. Our waitress was really good too. Even without a Groupon we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is generally pretty good. Portion size is great. When dining in, the service can be a little bit slow. Every time I have eaten there, the waitress and the bartender are one in the same. This usually isn't an issue but they can become very busy very quickly."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim after visiting family at St Margaret's.  Nice atmosphere and good food.  Highly recommended the deep dish pizza, and the wings were good.  Would come back."}
{"text":"Okay, I came to this place a lot for karaoke last year. It was fun cause I could take off my shirt and stuff and no one cared. They also had bar bingo which was a sure fire way to get drunk for under $15.  Recently, a lot of friends were raving about the pizza, which I have had a few times before. I remember it being what I call \"bar pizza\". Pizza that is doey and fluffy, tastes good when you are sober but even better when you are drunk, however at the end of the day there is nothing special or redeeming about it. Think of Pizza Hut or frozen pizza you may purchase at a grocery store. I gave the pizza another try. Perhaps I was wrong. No, it was the same doey, bar pizza. Not amazing by any standards. I asked the pizza mAker about the inspiration behind their pizza, his response \"I don't know... My mom bought a lot of tombstone when we were kids\". Aside from this pizza with a bad personality, the beer is way over priced, they don't even serve straub or pbr. The bartender told me they \"we're trying to get rid of that crowd\". The crowd however added to the subpar experience. The best I can describe it is Bloomfield's jersey shore.  In conclusion, if you wanna eat wack pizza, pay to much for beer while being surrounded by douches Caliente  is the place for you! The best thing this place can offer is they DO serve pizza till 2 pm."}
{"text":"A major disappointment.  We were planning on going to the sports bar this replaced.  Since we were there, we thought let's give it a try. One and done for sure.  We walk in, one of the staff asks us if we want a table, takes us to a table in the back. We wait and we wait and we wait, finally after 8-10 minutes I walk up to the bar and ask if some one can wait on us. Young waiter comes over. It's obviously he's new to this, not very organized. He was pleasant though. I order a beer, \"we're out of that\". I order a different beer, \"we're out of that\". On the 3rd attempt I'm successful. We order sandwiches, one Italian, decent looking, one fish, again decent but not great. The third was a Buffalo chicken breast, that sandwich was a joke. A ridiculously small amount of cut up chicken and a few French fries coated in buffalo sauce. Didn't fill the sandwich roll half way. My buddy complains to the waiter and they take it off the bill, he passes on another try. Next the waiter is asking if we want our check, \"no, we want another beer\". He brings the beers and then the check.  I wonder what it will be called the next time I go by?"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Caliente. First of all, the atmosphere is pretty cool. It's a smaller place, but the dark lighting and appearance of the place definitely make it a pretty relaxed setting. They have TVs and there's always music playing.   As far as the food goes, the pepperoni rolls are my absolute favorite. They offer food specials nightly, and the personal pizza for $5 is always a good go-to. The beer selection and draft list seem to always be updated when my group stops in, and they've hosted plenty of events with different featured beers.   it seems like a lot of people are starting to find out about the new ownership of this place. That's really great for business, but it seems to be making it much more crowded on any day of the week. Plan for some extra time for the kitchen/servers to catch up.   Lastly, the prices. They aren't out of the norm by any means.  For me, this is a gem of Bloomfield and definitely one of my favorite places to visit in the burgh."}
{"text":"My bf and I stopped by here to grab a bite to eat since it's apparently the only place in the area open past 11. Atmosphere is pretty chill. The food was amazing and the beer selection was impressive. I got the bbq chicken pizza and loaded fries (just Ok). My boyfriend got the steak and cheese pizza which was amazing.     Our waiter was nice but it was evident that he was ready to go home.  Definitely would come back here.  Pay in cash if you can...I witnessed unsafe handling of credit cards. Waiter left a credit card on the table and walked away from it!  #Yikes"}
{"text":"Service was great but ,The wait was very long and when we finally got our pizza it was just another mediocre pizza. I would understand if the place was busy but at that time there were two other couples there and already eating! I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Caliente: Because we can  This place is great for a microbrew or a carb-tastic bite.  The Food Caliente is known for their pizza and beer, so, get pizza and beer. Anything that contains pizza dough here is 10/10 - the stix and rolls, the the pizza, the calzones. They do this and they do it right. I would suggest a hoagie, any of the salads are average. This place always has an excellent draft list, so feel free to drop in for a nice microbrew.  I enjoyed the pepperoni rolls and pepperoni Bread. And the $5 personal pan pizza during happy hour also gains mad respect.  Their draft list is a great place to find rare microbrews from near and far.   The Staff Friendly but not the fastest.  The staff here is friendly and knowledgable but always a little slow. I won't hold it against them.  They do what they can.   The Ambience Regardless of time of day, this page is always a black hole of regret. Next level classic rock is always on the juke box.  They have some solid chalk art on the walls.    Check this place out in Bloomfield. #winning"}
{"text":"My burger was completely raw when I asked for medium well. Took a bite and it was disgusting."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love beer. I love beer not in the \"yeah I drink KBS when it comes around\" way, I love beer in the \"I trade, travel for, and cellar some of the rarest beer in the world\" way. Fuss if you will about the food, that's subject to opinion, but fussing about the beer here is asinine.  Your glass smelled of bleach? Say something, I've never had an experience here where they wouldn't correct it! Your beer was too expensive for a small pour? Do your research. Those beers are very difficult to acquire, the kegs are extremely expensive, and typically the bar owners take a small margin just to be able to offer said beers at their establishment. In addition, most of those beers are very high in ABV, so it's responsible serving to not give 16oz of an 11% beer to customers.  I moved here from Philly (consistently rated one of the top beer cities in America), and it was extremely hard to find the rarer beers in Pittsburgh. Establishments like Caliente and a handful of others are bringing credibility to the craft beer community in Pittsburgh. The first day I walked in I breathed a long sigh of relief and thought, \"damn, I'm home\".  As for the food, I can't speak of the delivery as I always go in to enjoy my food with a beer. The pizza has always been properly cooked, and the other Pittsburgh standards of fried foods and rolls are pretty spot on. I don't go there to get a charcuterie and roast leg of lamb, I go there for solid wings and a world class beer. I really couldn't ask for more of a craft beer bar in Pittsburgh.  Last, I've had the opportunity to get to know the owners during my visits in the past year. If you see something wrong, think something is off, or are generally displeased, just tell them. Write your review, that's cool, but have the courtesy to let the business owner know so they can right the wrongs. Turns out they're really normal, nice people."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very cool, great staff, great beer selection, decent Italian-style bar food. Biggest hit here is the one to my wallet. Most of the beer selection was offered only in a tulip glass and ranged from $7-8.50 for a portion significantly smaller than a pint. BUT, the selection is extensive and has several local brews. Several televisions within a small place which is good for watching sports.   Would and should be a 4ish... I do recommend it though."}
{"text":"Anytime I can get back to the Bloomfield, the place in which I grew up I enjoy it.  I only had the pizza to eat.  There is better pizza in the area, but I would still rate the pizza slightly above average.  The crust is a little chewy, but the overall taste and toppings are good enough.  What sets this pizza place apart from others is the beer list.  You can walk in at any time and get 1-2 drafts that would be hard to find at other places."}
{"text":"Great beer list and good food.  It was crowded and loud when we went but it's understandable due to it being after midnight.  Decent pizza, a bit greasy. Staff was wonderful."}
{"text":"I went to both Caliente's (the one in Bloomfield and the one in Castle Shannon) within about a month of one another and after that experience I feel compelled to write about the subpar food at both places.  At the Caliente's in Bloomfield the food was ok...it was slightly better then what i ate in Castle Shannon. The pizza was still sort of blah and the toppings were probably the best part of the pizza. it's the kind of pizza where you don't want to eat the crust because it's just extra crappy dough.  The service was terrible. They had a huge party in the back and the front tables were filled and the girl manning the bar was supposed to be the waitress for everyone. It was laughable. The huge party in the back wasn't impromptu, so it was sort of appalling that they couldn't figure out scheduling for that.   Also, their featured beer of the month was sold out, and it was the first week of the month on a Saturday. Seriously? You are promoting something that is not even in stock?  It just makes you wonder what other poor management things are happening if this crap is bubbling to the surface."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to grab a drink after dinner. We walked around until we found the draft house. I'm a beer connoisseur and love a good Belgian stout.  The beer was phenomenal but the customer service needs some work.  The bartender was very rude and harassed my sister who was paying with cash. His attitude towards other elderly customers was not kind either. I understand that people have a bad day, but you work for the public. Suck it up. Probably won't be back!"}
{"text":"I'm actually Italian, and caliente is really, really good. They tend to put too much cheese on their pizza, but overall their dough is great, and the ingredients of good quality. A great spot in the city"}
{"text":"Went to the Mt. Lebanon location with high hopes and was somewhat disappointed.  First off - ditch the plastic plates and forks. It's cheap and not appropriate for a sit down restaurant. Was almost shocked at this - a new location in an upscale neighborhood and plastic dinnerware? WTF was that?  I ordered just a plain cheese pizza. Was skimpy on the sauce but otherwise a B-. Good crust but more sauce please. A little dry. The salad was decent enough but not wow.  Given the prices I would have hoped for more. I'll stick with Giovanni's, Aiello's (the best)."}
{"text":"Pizza, sticks, hoagies, salads--everything here is consistently delicious. The pepperoni cheesy bread is a go-to favorite. Salad greens are always fresh and the house dressing is fantastic. Beer list fluctuates between good and great."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza, wings, beer and is my favorite spot to watch the Pens. Last time I was here I got the white pizza on their pan pizza crust, which was absolutely delicious. I'm also happy with their rotating craft beer list."}
{"text":"Got my delivery 45 minutes late and it was cold and tasted like a hunk of cold cheese garbage.    Terrible."}
{"text":"I like their food inside only.  Take-out from this place is astoundingly bad.  They forget everything the dish is supposed to come with.  I know food is supposed to be eaten fresh made from kitchen to plate so that's why I don't judge too hard on takeout food, but the take-out service is horrible.  The old lady driver that needs to bath is very rude.  Bill came and it wasn't what grub hub had quoted so I told her and she could care less, even after I tipped over 20% before driver fee. If you are driving you still have to represent the company.  Best pepperoni rolls around."}
{"text":"Setting:  Friday night at 6 pm.  Bloomfield location.  It was so cold in there. Plot:  I am here for beers, pizza and good convo. Conflict:  Service was average (not good or bad).  Food came in a normal to fast amount of time, but beers were a little lagging Epilogue:  I will go back again.  Theme:  Hipster pizza    In my head, this place was going to be so packed that I wasn't going to be able to find a seat.  To my surprise, there was a few open tables so we sat down immediately.    The beer list is quite extensive.  They have a wide variety of styles.  I am an IPA drinker and a few options tickled my fancy.   We started to check out the menu and guess what?  it is happy hour  until 6:30.  Half off drafts and $5 personal pan pizzas with one topping.  Cha-ching.  We ordered a salad (large enough to share) and my pizza was pretty great.  Crust was just crunchy enough and not too shabby with the toppings."}
{"text":"Caliente makes good food, but don't expect them to actually deliver it. 4 for the food, 0 for the service."}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn on this review. The food gets at least a 4, but the service is a 2 max. On multiple occasions, the Bloomfield location has just simply not fulfilled an order. You order, they tell you 20 minutes, you show up, and they've totally forgotten to make it. On one occasion, they had us pay twice before realizing the error. This was because they did not make the original order (although it was paid for), and simply reentered the order a second time. I have heard the same from a few friends, so it appears to be a shared experience.   The staff is nice enough, but don't expect quick service. The food is fantastic, but with barrier you have to cross to get it, it makes you hesitant to even bother."}
{"text":"The three stars are mostly for the awesome tap and bottle selection offered at Caliente. As a beer lover it's nice to see somewhere other than D's in Regent Square with this sort of massive selection. I wish the food was a better deal frankly, so that prevents my review from being better. My roommate and I have tried getting meals to-go, and it's been an underwhelming experience. Everything is a bit overpriced for the portion size and quality. My advice: Come to Caliente to pick up some epic beers, and go anywhere else on this wonderful little stretch of Liberty Avenue for takeout!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cool local place to hang and enjoy some good beers, Caliente is it.  Their beers, both bottled and on tap (including many local selections), rotate frequently so there's always a fresh selection.  I usually order a flight so I can try a few beers when it's too difficult to decide on just one or two.  The website is also updated regularly with the current draft and bottle list.  It's also good to know that they will fill any growler with almost any of their draft selections.  Caliente offers daily food and drink specials in addition to their weekday happy hour specials.  The food isn't high class, but I'd say it's better than your average bar food.  I've thrown the kitchen a curve ball when I ordered fries with the special request that they be tossed in the garlic parm sauce used for wings and they delivered.  I've tried several of their other wing flavors (I prefer the boneless in the Blues Brothers sauce), the Italian and Steak subs, the gourmet pizzas and even a calzone (which they will warn you might take some extra time to bake but is well worth it).  I don't always go there to eat, but I end up smelling the food and at least order something to go most nights I'm there.  While everything I've had has been good, I would definitely recommend the gourmet pizzas before anything else.  (The Thai Chicken is definitely worth your time.)  I wouldn't recommend delivery but instead order take-out ahead of time.  Or go for a beer while you wait for your food.   Don't forget to check out the downstairs bar, known as the Railsplitter Speakeasy.  It's got a different vibe than the upstairs bar which can feel a bit more divey and crowded.  The Railsplitter has a more cozy feel and I find it a better atmosphere for enjoying a good craft beer.  (If it was up to me, the whole place would look and feel like the Railsplitter.)  I get some of the complaints, but on several of my own visits to Caliente, I find the problem is with the clientele.  In other words, people go in for a beer and then don't know what to do when they can't get a Bud Light.  These are the people who can ruin a good night for an otherwise great server.    Just remember if you're thinking about checking it out it's called Caliente PIZZA and DRAFT House.  And if you enjoy a great beer and a perfect slice, buy the crew a 6-pack as a thank you."}
{"text":"In house is great service, but every time I have tried to receive a delivery order has been like an experiment to see if the clerk actually listened through the phone, the people who deliver are rude, not respectable and look at you like you owe them a gold medal, I'm sorry but you are a pizza dispensary in Pittsburgh not an Olympic stand"}
{"text":"Always hope for better here,   sit at bar for 6 minutes listening to employees talk about their lives.  Barmaid finally comes over and asks me to wait.  (place has 5people in it) Wait another 3 minutes then she drops off a menu and keeps rolling.  Goes in back --trailing another employee who keeps chatting.  Finally returns circulating tables and then asks me what I'd like,  I order a beer and she says we are out, i look at her and she scowls when I ask why tell me that now.   Irritated by the whole thing.  leave. More options elsewhere.  try them first."}
{"text":"I ordered an Italian calzone and a buffalo chicken salad for delivery.  They arrived in about 45 minutes, which given that it was a Saturday I thought was reasonable.  The delivery guy was very nice and polite and called me as he got to the front door of my building.  The calzone was huge--imagine a medium sized pizza folded in half. It was actually delivered in a pizza box.  It has lots of ricotta and mozzarella cheese, plus some Italian meats.  The bread part of the calzone was very good.  The buffalo chicken salad was also a quite generous portion and was exactly as described:  mixed greens (arugula, baby spinach, etc.), red onion, green bell pepper, french fries, grilled chicken tossed w/ buffalo hot sauce and cheddar cheese.  I got the homemade ranch dressing and it was really good.    I thought given the portion size, the freshness of the ingredients, and the fact that the calzone was made from scratch (the dough, sauce, etc.) it was reasonable.  It will easily be 3 meals for me."}
{"text":"Worst service!!! Took 3 hours for us to receive over food! No one answered the phone for over an hour. When the delivery driver finally showed up she didn't even get out of her car.. Proceeded to hand me our order out of her car window! Soggy fries, cold pizza, awful customer service! The only redeeming quality was the ranch dressing..."}
{"text":"We love that they opened a new spot in the Aspinwall area.  This is a very hip feeling spot.  The service has been fantastic and the pizza and wings are the same great quality that Caliente has become famous for!!  Can't wait to hit this spot again real real soon!!"}
{"text":"Liz J. and I visited Caliente's for the first time about a month ago. We were super hungry and wanted to try everything on the menu!  We ordered the loaded fries and breaded zucchini to start. They were both delicious! Although they were amazing, they weren't anything out of the ordinary when it comes to bar appetizers.  Next, we ordered the buffalo chicken rolls and the jalapeno bacon rolls. I assumed we would be receiving two small orders, since they were only $7 each and I became adjusted to receiving small portions of rolls at restaurants.   No. There were six rolls in each order and they were HUGE. I was only able to finish one of each and I was completely stuffed. They were homemade and absolutely amazing. The flavors were awesome and they went deliciously with their homemade ranch.   I was pleasantly surprised with my visit to Caliente's. I assumed it was going to be just another pizza bar, but it wasn't at all. Awesome service, a great selection of drafts and OUT of this WORLD rolls! I also ordered pepperoni rolls to go and gave them to my cousin- she loved them too!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Good food. Subpar service. I really want to patronize this place more but 2 visits and both with crappy service makes it tough."}
{"text":"Let me start off saying we called them up to do a delivery of food and beer they took the card number no biggies it would be there in 30 minutes... 1 hour 15 min later no food is here so we call them and ask where the food is they say no it's too far away so why wouldn't you call us back to let us know? $31 charged to the card on top and now waiting for the refund! 1 out of 5 all day long on charging the card then not delivering or informing can't deliver food to are location."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I order from here every once in a while. There are WAY better places, and from this last experience, I will be ordering elsewhere if ordering my lunch at work.  Their pizza is pretty good. They have a really great selection of different specialty pizzas too, so if you do order from here, I recommend pizza.   Today, I decided to order a burger. I swear it was not even edible. The meat is weird, the cheese was practically nonexistent, the bun was mushy, and the toppings were not fresh. Their French fries are edible, but they're always soggy.  They also give us a hard time about ordering separate orders, even if there is only two of us! They charge a delivery fee to each order, and their food is expensive to begin with.  I have never eaten inside or experienced their beer selection, but from my experiences, I will be ordering elsewhere, as this was never my favorite place to order anyways."}
{"text":"The food was average but the service was nonexistent. We started out with a waiter who took our initial drink order but never returned. Thus we flagged down another waitress who seemed flummoxed when we asked her to take our order. Begrudgingly, she did.  Service was unreliable throughout dinner. It was nearly impossible to get a drink refill or even extra napkins. The silverware was plastic, which is cheap, classless, and ridiculous (i.e., this wasn't an outdoor picnic affair). And they catered much more to larger parties of ten plus people than they did the two tops. That was disappointing because we would have tipped well if they paid us some attention.  Finally, they tolerated classless customers. They did nothing when some kid continuously spiked a basketball up and down the aisles. This is bad parenting and a case of bad parents who spent most of their time texting. But I won't make that the point of my review.  Bottom line: My money is as green as the next guy's. It spends anywhere. I won't waste it here. And I certainly won't waste my time trying to flag someone down or twist their arm to get a drink."}
{"text":"This is a cool, clean Bloomfield bar. It's nonsmoking if you do not like that about some of the other East End \"hot spots\" and the drinks are pretty darn cheap. The food is good bar food. It's not like wow cool foodie bar food like Brillo Box or something but it tastes great. I loved the fries and the pizza was so good that I ate enough that I felt full for days. Also, karaoke night here is low key and fun and you can be \"that guy\" who does multiple songs very easily. I give this review based on four nice experiences."}
{"text":"Great beer selection!  The wings were fantastic as was the pizza.  I really enjoyed the food but have to downgrade the rating based on the service.  The wings didn't show up until we were 2/3 done with our pizza and we waited a long time before our server was able to take care of us.  Part of the problem was probably the fact that they were understaffed due to the Little Italy festival going on outside...I definitely will try again as I expect that this was an anomaly.  Edited after first review: been here three times since, no service problems, great food, really good daily beer specials. Stars upgraded."}
{"text":"Caliente has amazing food.  Their pizza is very good.  The dough and sauce are amazing.  The hoagies are awesome.  I think the buns are made in house.  The only reason I'm giving them only four stars is their beer prices are a tad high and the draft selection seems to always be beer I don't care for."}
{"text":"Ordered the other night from here and of course I didn't get pizza. I opted for the burger once again (I've been on a burger kick lately). And of course this place didn't disappoint.  The burger was nice and big, made sure it filled the bun. Topped with the usual lettuce, tomato and onion. Bigger than burgers you may find at other places in the city. I ordered fries as my side and was not disappointed with them. Nice size portion for the price. They had some type of coating on them that made them a little more crunchy than what you would find at any fast food place.   Deliver is through GrubHub, so a fee does apply (this fee varies on the place you order from, from what I have noticed)."}
{"text":"First time order here and really surprised how good the food was. Everything is really fresh hot from the kitchen and all the ingredients are fresh, Not like the cheap frozen ones you ordered from some places.  The gentleman and the delivery man both are nice and fast, making the process is so much easier to order out. Highly recommended business to everyone out-there. Definitely will try more stuff from this place"}
{"text":"I really wish i could give a review in the food but didnt stay long enough. First off being that its a bar my expectations werent the highest. We were greeted promptly when came in which was nice, but on the way back to our seats i thought i was going to slip and break my neck. Then after being seated and waiting about 10 minutes with no one coming up to say hello, ill be right with you, or i dont know how about maybe an order if drinks at the very least. I decided it was time to go. In an area where places to eat are everywhere you would think maybe they could have at leastbsome good customer service."}
{"text":"Meat lovers pizza is excellent. Duck pizza (when offered) is amazing. Very good craft beers on tap. Parking not too difficult to find. Service is good."}
{"text":"I love the food at Caliente. They have such a great wait staff. The bartenders are well informed on all their craft beers. I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a long time. Love the selection of craft beers and the staff is great"}
{"text":"Another dime a dozen Pittsburgh small pizza shop. Paid $6 for a slice of red velvet cake and received a tiny piece, was barely an inch wide at the widest spot. Paid $5.49 for an order of breaded zucchini and got maybe 8 thin strips, much less than most places I've gotten it from.   A big ripoff and does nothing to differentiate itself from the 80% of Pittsburgh Pizza shops that are on a similar level."}
{"text":"Three times we have ordered for delivery...three times the order was wrong....like the food....frustrated with the lack of care placed when packing our orders....we are done....:(:("}
{"text":"Placed an order at 11 pm; never received it, nor any call from the establishment to make it right or to ascertain where to deliver my food.  When I called I got a loop of voicemails with no option to leave a message."}
{"text":"The food was good but to order two salads and have them show up on their sides in the bag and sauce from the buffalo chicken salad leaking everywhere. The delivery woman couldn't even hold the bag in a manner to keep the salads sitting properly in their containers. My chef salad should not have had buffalo sauce in it. Thoroughly disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Update:  Food and drinks are good. Prices are up there (it is craft beer after all). Service is lacking.   Came here once again for pizza and beer on a Saturday night. They needed my card to open a tab. No problem. I specifically requested to pay cash and that I \"didn't want to use the card\" twice before they \"closed\" the tab. He said that was fine. I was holding cash in my hand and the guy hands me my card and receipt to sign. I never knew something so simple could be so hard to understand. Just disappointing.   Also, I'm not sure why but in the \"speakeasy\" downstairs it smelled like someone was smoking nearby or even inside. Not sure what that was about but it was very odd."}
{"text":"NEVER ORDER DELIVERY. This is the second time we ordered pizza for delivery from Caliente. This is also the second time we waited for 2 hours for our pizza to arrive and it arrived cold. We live less than 10 minutes away from the restaurant, probably closer to 5 minutes. Both times we called after an hour and a half and they told us \"it is out for delivery now\". We will never order from here again. The pizza is not cheap and to wait two hours for a cold pizza is absolutely ridiculous. The only reason this doesn't get 1 star is because the pizza is really delicious when you go to the actual restaurant. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"We used to order from Caliente's a lot. We always thought their delivery was spot on and we even liked to pick up our orders and grab a beer while we waited. The food has always been good. I loveeee their pizza sauce, especially with banana peppers and sausage.  I have a few qualms, though, and I feel like they can be pretty easy fixes (maybe).  1. I used to always order buffalo shrimp salad and they were always out of the buffalo shrimp so I had to settle for buffalo chicken -_-. I've since stopped ordering it, so I'm not sure if that ever panned out. 2. I have had multiple occasions where we will order something, go to pick it up, and it's not ready - not only is it not ready, they haven't even started to make it. One time, I ordered pick up, and they ... delivered it (they already had my address on file, lol oops). 3. The service is hit or miss. I do love sitting at the bar though, they are very attentive. 4. This is such a privileged thing to complain about and I'm so sorry, but if you order a pepperoni pizza, you better really love pepperoni because the whole pizza will be COVERED in pepperoni. It leaves it very greasy but admittedly, pretty tasty.  Again, I love Caliente's food... there are just little things that I think we should all be aware of :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Clean. Scrumptious food. Great beer selection. EXTREMELY friendly bartenders. I felt like everyone at this bar was an old friend. It. Was. Great."}
{"text":"I finally gave Caliente another try after several bad experiences, and I'm happy I did. Delivery was prompt, service was quick, and the pizza was great.  I had sworn off this place, but after a few great orders, it's back to my go-to."}
{"text":"First, I want to state that this rating is NOT in relation to the food quality. The food we were served was superb!  The reason I am giving the Liberty Ave store this two star rating is due to the quality of service. My friends and I arrived at the bar after two other bars had quit serving food hours ago. This was my first time at any Caliente location. My friends had informed me about the delicious food, even one secret item named after my friend, the great beer and the good people who run it. So needless to say that on a Saturday night,where the weather had turned for better, I expected what I had been told.   The server seemed frustrated that there were so many of us (to be clear we were only 8). She begrudgingly gave us individual checks and she was not attentive to our needs as far as refills. She also did not inform us of last call, I had realized the lights were brightened and then inquired. She wasn't interested in getting our last round, and another friend of mine had to hold her attention so she wouldn't run off with only 2 of us giving the last orders.   My friend and I were the only people who got plates and silverware because we ordered an extra large pizza. Everyone else was served in to go boxes. At 1:30am! I was shocked at how rude this was. Then at 1:50pm \"Closing Time\" came on the radio. We were all amused and joking about it, until it came on again and again. Whoever was on duty for management last night was an embarrassment. The made callous choices and did not hold up to the service level I was told about.   I don't know if I will return to this location. Which is sad because my Thai pizza was fantastic."}
{"text":"I will never order another pizza from Caliente ever again.   Tonight I decided to use my \"credit\" for my botched pizza from my last review. Apparently wrong thing to do. So they told me the wait would be 30 to 45 minutes. Ordered this at 1218. I don't get any calls from Caliente about my delivery or that the driver is even outside. All I get is a knock on the door but by the time I get outside no ones there.   It's 130 I call for my pizza.  At this point after 3 undercooked pizzas and an undelivered one what can I say I'm pissed. Not only do I get yelled after asking for a refund for the credited pizza as well what I ordered on this ordered he tells me I don't deserve the refund (from apparently \"2 weeks ago\" he says I'm pretty sure it has only been 5 days let me check my Yelp records) for the credited pizza I never received. By the way everyone this is coming from the exact same person who botched the order from the last review. Now hes saying that he didn't even make a mistake on the last one after he owned up to everything in the last review. Um. What? Im over it.   I speak to the manager who apparently likes to let his employees yell at people over the phone and tell him I want everything refunded and that no I don't want a free pizza. I don't care if he makes it and that all I want is an apology from his employee for yelling at me telling me guess what I'M WRONG. Even the manager doesn't think I deserve an apology.  Caliente heres a few lessons for you: 1. Employees need to show professionalism regardless of how annoyed, rude, pissed, off a customer is. There is no back and forth. 2. Hanging up on customers too is a no go. 3. Learn how to make a pizza. The pizza that you were probably going to give me this time was probably undercooked too.  Time to start ordering from GIovannis at least their pizzas are consistent."}
{"text":"What a good find!  I do not work too far from this little establishment and I have to say that since it was discovered, we have gotten many a goodies from here.   Their portions are large, and definitely quality... I have not had anything that I did not think was great here.  They are always fast and seem to possess a high level of customer service too... delivery is always fast too!  I suggest trying this place if you have not done so yet..."}
{"text":"This is by far my worst food experience in YEARS, pizza is bad- when I was lucky to receive it 2 hours after I had placed an order, my partner ordered pizza delivery a month later- i didn't know it was from the same place-and after 2 and a half hours I had to cancel the order, and during the 2 and a half hours every time I try calling they talk in a rude way and a very unprofessional and a careless way, the only reason i gave one star is because I can't give ZERO stars... Horrible pizza and Horrible customer service.. never again!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here a number of times and I really like the food and beer selection but the service, frankly, sucks.  If I could look past the service this would be a 4, maybe even 5 star review, but again the service consistently sucks.   Let's review the service first and just get this out of the way. Tonight we came in and it was moderately busy so we sat/stood at the bar.  We all ordered beers (at least 3 on their draught list were kicked but still on the chalk board. How hard is it to erase a chalk board?) and our friends ordered a pizza.  The wait wasn't long for the pizza but when the kitchen brought out the pizza they just set it on the back bar. And there it sat for 10 minutes while the bar tender and servers walked by it and wouldn't make eye contact with us.  Finally my friends were served their lukewarm pizza after we pointing out that it was there.  No apologies or acknowledgment of an issue were given. When it started to clearing out we moved to a table and had some more beers. At the end of the night a friend had to leave early so he cashed out his tab.  After our friend had left the bartender came over and stated that he had given our tab to my friend whom had left so we would need to pay his which was much larger.  He stated that we could just get the money back from our friend for the difference later on.  Once again no real apology was given.  I am really not sure how his mental error became my problem but it seems kind of ridiculous that I became responsible for it and it isn't like there is a manager on duty to deal with.  Onto the good stuff.  The pizza is well above average and my wife especially loves the buffalo chicken pizza. The wings are some of the best in town.  Fried crisp and sauced properly.  The beer list is also one of the best in the east end.  They boast around 20 taps and the selection is always unique and well rounded for even the most demanding beer guy or girl.  Bottom line, I'll come back. But I know that service will probably continue to suck and that I really have to be proactive as a customer when I am there."}
{"text":"I usually don't post reviews on here, but I feel compelled enough to do it now after a second bad experience with Caliente's. Their pizza is passable, but their service is not. Resting on the laurels of their \"Best Pizza in Pittsburgh\" label, they certainly don't carry a similar attention to detail when it comes to customer service. Twice now that I have ordered delivery online, the pizza has been late (really late, like 1.5-2 hours late). After speaking with the restaurant on the last order, I was given the line that \"we are told by our manager to tell you at delivery will be at least one hour.\"  What does that even mean? It's 2pm on a Monday, I highly doubt your staff is currently taxed with orders at this point. And really? It takes 2 hours to make and deliver a pizza? So there goes my first Yelp review, and unforunately, as much as I'd like to be a positive person - this place definitely grinds my gears."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. Good pizza,  yummy wings and nice beer. Our server was nice and explained everything we inquired about to our satisfaction. I'm a nut for hot wings and can never find them hot enough.  They have one that is really nice and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Horrible! Do not order from here! Worse customer service ever.  I called and ordered a pizza for delivery from the Mt Lebanon restaurant. They told us 45 minutes. 25 minutes later they called back to say that they couldn't make the type of pizza that we wanted because the dough used to make it was in the basement, and the basement was flooded. They offered a different type of pizza so we changed our order. After an hour we were still waiting. So we called the restaurant to check on the status of our order. They put me on hold, left me on hold for several minutes, then hung up. I called back again and she hung up a second time. Another 15 minutes later the delivery person knocked on the door, offering a string of excuses that made no sense for the TWO HOUR WAIT. The saddest part? This pizza isn't that great. There are lots of other options in Mt Lebanon... go with one of them instead."}
{"text":"I visited last night around 6pm with a friend to check Caliente out, since I'd never been before and had a City Dining Card.  Our visit got off to a poor start when my friend and I went to order the winter sangria that was the daily special, and were told they were out (it's not like it was super late).  I eventually ended up ordering a sour peach lambic that was interesting, if pricey ($7.50--I could have had a cocktail at that price), and my friend ordered nothing but water.  For our food, we ordered the following: Cajun fries ($5.99), cheesy bread sticks ($6.99), and 16\" chicken ranchero pizza ($16.99).  Shortly after taking our order, our waiter returned to inform us that the kitchen was out of salsa for the fries (???).  He told us the fries also come with nacho cheese, so I asked him to put it on the side for us.  In my experience, Cajun fries are fries with a Cajun spice rub, and do not include salsa or nacho cheese (maybe these were Eastern Texan Cajun fries?).  I was glad I ordered the nacho cheese on the side, because my friend and I agreed that it tasted weird with the Cajun rub.  The Cajun rub itself was good, but the fries were pretty greasy, with some sticking together, so be forewarned of this.  As for the breadsticks and pizza, they were less than impressive.  Since they both include crust and cheese, they tasted pretty similar, and the amount of bacon on the breadsticks was less than impressive.  I didn't find them particularly flavorful, and the marinara sauce that comes with them was watery.  The pizza was a bit better on the flavor front due to the ranch dressing, but the amount of chicken was less than impressive.  The crust of the pizza is thick, and the overall effect and flavor reminded me of Bites and Brews' pizza, which I also find mediocre.  The fact that we only finished about (and took) half of it is evidence that both of us found it unimpressive.  Needless to say, my friend and I were less than impressed with Caliente.  Now that I've used my City Dining Card, I probably won't return, given the number of better pizza places in PGH.  One positive is that they do have good happy hour specials, so if you want cheap food and drinks, this may be your place.  However, if you're looking for quality, I suggest that you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered the Steak Sub with no mushrooms. Not the best and not the worst sub I've ever had but closer to the worst. Just look at the lettuce they gave me. It's like they don't even care lol I would have gave them another star but their customer service was pretty poor as well"}
{"text":"As I detailed in my first review, the pizza and wings here were pretty bad.  I have since been back for their karaoke night and it was pretty fun. Apparently this is the new \"cool\" hangout spot, or so I've heard. I guess they're hosting shows, etc. and really trying to make this more of a bar than a restaurant, which is cool since I didn't find the food particularly good.  BUT...the bartenders here are HORRIBLE. I mean, they are really just bad bartenders, at least the two that were there the night I was there (and apparently are like always there). The one girl looked angry the whole time and wouldn't give me a straw for my cranberry vodka (seriously, who wants to drink well vodka without a straw?). She also gave attitude when my friend asked for a lime for her Tecate (again, who wants to drink Tecate without lime?). AND she didn't even open the beer, which I'm pretty sure is illegal (my friend has since been back and said that this is a common occurrence). The male bartender tried a lame attempt at flirting with me by continuously mentioning my bright red shorts. And then my friend's double gin-and-ginger-ale got knocked over literally a minute after she paid for it, and the bartender witnessed it, and he charged her for it!! I know the bartender's not required to comp you a drink or anything...but every time this has happened to me (most recently, at Mad Mex...I was talking with my hands a little too enthusiastically...), the bartender hasn't made me pay for a replacement drink. And I didn't have to ask, either. LAME!  Weirdly...the pizza I saw some people eating looked nothing like the pizza I received when I ordered delivery from them. So maybe I did get a bad one, who knows."}
{"text":"Fantastic Pizza!   Some of the best pizza I've had in a while.   The wings were also tasty. Good beer selection  Seemed a bit underserved when we first got there but more folks came on shift and service improved."}
{"text":"Love ordering from this place for takeout. Food is always delicious and delivered quickly. So I decided to go and eat in. Terrible! We ordered apps and a shrimp salad and a burger. and our apps took almost an hour to get to the table! When our apps we dropped off we were informed they had no burgers and no shrimp. So we had to reorder and wait almost another hour until our new meals came-and they came at different times!! And we were STILL overcharged for our initial orders. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great, cheap pizza.. Definitely nothing to write home about, but my plain 18\" pie was less than $9 for takeout. The pizza itself tasted good - light on the sauce and heavy on the cheese, and the crust was excellent for your basic American-style pizza. Most of the menu is under $10 for pasta, hoagies, etc, and they have some pretty good coupons as well. They appear to have some daily food and drink specials. Monday wing night and thursday burger night, and maybe a half-off pasta on wednesday.  Inside Caliente there is also a bar. Reasonably priced, the selection didn't seem out of this world but $4 Sarnac seasonals tied us over while we waited for our pizza to come out. We also got buffalo fries - which unfortunately were not as we imagined, the potato-based cousin of the wing, but rather a knock off of Buffalo Wild Wing's buffalo chips(thick-sliced potato chips with curly fry seasoning). Tasty, none-the-less, and sometimes thin enough that the edges were crispy like a chip, delicious!  All-in-all, just a neighborhood bar and pizza joint. If you're looking for a cheap pizza and you live around here, definitely give them a call."}
{"text":"I remember when this joint was Gator's. Bomb wings back in the day and a bartender that was strapped. Last time I was in there it smelled like poop. I think it was built on an Indian burial ground"}
{"text":"The Luau Pizza is always my favorite! I feel that I haven't eat the pizza like this for a long time!"}
{"text":"The backs of the server's shirts read \"Beer Geek.\" My mother described her beer type to our waiter, who then matchmaked her with a draft she loved.  We had hot wings, hot, fresh, tasty sauce (mild).  Loved our pizzas--don't let the bar aesthetic fool you. The food is great. If we lived in Pittsburgh, we'd be here all the time."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday night to pick up food and a 12 pack, no complaints about the food it was great, but the female bar tending at the time was one of the rudest and sour type of person I've met in my life. The date was 9/9 if any manager reads this it would be in their best interest to reconsider allowing that woman to tend a bar."}
{"text":"If you haven't had beer or food from a Caliente yet, what are you waiting for?!  World pizza champions isn't a lie !   In the  of Pittsburgh's Little Italy,  Caliente features a full bar, lots of  Rotating fine and local beers, they clean their lines EVERY Wednesday! These folks are serious about good tastes! Happy hour 4:30-6:30 weekdays, half priced craft drafts, AND a happy hour menu! Today we are stopping in for amazing pepperoni cheesy bread! It just arrived!  Bon appetit!!"}
{"text":"So the food was good but the beer is overpriced. I've never seen beer come in  such a little glasse.. A toaster or a flask glass really.. Don't be cheap come on seriously I will not be returning..there  is better places elsewhere... Plus the service was mediocre just like the other  reviews You would think they would have learned"}
{"text":"I don't normally like pizza, but Caliente's makes a really good one. The atmosphere is very casual and our server was sweet and really pretty. I didn't expect to like Caliente since it comes off as a dive, but I was surprised."}
{"text":"Gator's was the best.  The place that went in after Gator's was not good.  This place is better than that place, so I'm happy.  Nothing really notably good or bad about the place.  They do have pretty darn good pizza, which pushes it from a 3 star to a 4 star.  The wings were ok.  The bartender/server was friendly and attentive.    I'll go back."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my evening at Caliente last Saturday, especially after reading lots of 2 and 3 star reviews.  I went for a birthday party in the downstairs room and found the place to be lots of fun.  A bunch of us filled up the entire downstairs, so we pretty much had the bartender two ourselves.  The bartender was really nice and served everyone quickly, remembering everyone's drinks.  The beer selection was fantastic, especially for a random bar in Bloomfield. The food was pretty good and not greasy.  I'll for sure be back from a trivia night.  Only drawback is that only the (kinda gross) women's restroom is on the first floor, rather than the basement."}
{"text":"Food is very good! Service was excellent close to the hospital nice for groups very sporty atmosphere, but not noisy. We stopped in on s Sunday afternoon"}
{"text":"This location is only good if you eat inside. Just got delivery first off the delivery driver was an older dark haired woman I paid with a credit card over the phone she gave me the receipt to sign when she got here..I signed it and gave it back and she said \"what about the tip\" I said haha funny you ask as I had her CASH tip in my hand. Never ask for a tip I should of kept the tip I gave her just because she had the nerve to ask.  We took our food and opened it up I got a chicken ranchero pizza it had no ranch on it at all and also asked for a side of ranch with my friends chicken tenders didn't get any... my pizza is so dry I rather feed it to my dog. HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food, can't say the same about their service. I waited an hour and 20 minutes for two pizzas and when they finally arrived they were incredibly cold! Not a happy customer."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Crust was perfectly fine , not too hard, no burnt pieces.  Large has 8 cuts, plenty for a family of 4. You knew its his when the table is quiet :-)  I had the Blues Brothers wings. I really liked them. It was hit sauce mixed with ranch and blue cheese.  The loaded French fries were tasty! Fresh cut with cheese and bacon. Will def come back!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to write this review, because I'm actually obsessed with Caliente's Hawaiian pizza, but the service is so bad I feel that I can no longer give them my business! Every time I order I get the same thing-- and that's pretty frequent (don't judge) and every time I call and order they tell me it will be 45 minutes.... and every time it is late. Last time, the woman who delivered it told me they dropped it and didn't want to give me a bad product-- ok fair. But, why wouldn't you let me know that or give me some sort of discount since it was so late? If that was the only time this sort of thing happened, I would give them a pass, but they are always late and the one time I went into the actual establishment the service was slow and inattentive as well. Maybe it's a training problem... a hiring problem?  Pros: +Pizza is GOOD  Cons: -Slow inattentive service -Slow delivery -general lack of concern about the happiness of their patrons"}
{"text":"When the bartender has to take 5 minutes to finish his cigarette before coming in and waiting on you....why would anyone come here.  Who cares about the food."}
{"text":"I can't believe Caliente only has 3 stars! They have one of the best happy hours in Pittsburgh: half off craft drafts and $5 one-topping personal pizzas from 4:30-630pm weekdays. They have also have daily beer specials. This is definitely a craft beer lover's paradise. They have the most unique selection of brews in the Burgh. They support local breweries by keeping them in tap and collaborating on brews and events. They also serve beers that are seemingly nowhere else in town. The pizza and calzones are delicious, but that's the extent of food that I've tried. One woman who works there is miserable (I've never seen her smile), but she is an exception to the rule.  With the great beer, pizza, and deals, I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"While Caliente is one of my easy, go-to spots to bring friends for a quick drink, I have to say it's not my favorite joint. Its cave-like lighting is certainly not improved by its blasting music that ensures that you neither see nor hear your friends.  The food pretty all right-- it is about two steps above bar food-- tasty, but nothing uber fantastical.   What I keep going back for, however, is their excellent draft and bottle selection. They provide tasty craft brews, often local ones too, all the time. I love it!"}
{"text":"Dear Caliente, you being in my neighborhood is dangerous business indeed. I stopped back after being TRAPPED in traffic one night in hopes of finding some homemade tiramisu since I remembered it being on the menu. While they didn't have any, I did get two slices of cheesecake for next to nothing. Only downside, it was frozen when I got home.   I stopped back in tonight to grab a small pizza for spinster-dinner. I opted for the buffalo chicken pizza. It came out on this beautiful platter, all puffy crust and browned cheese.  This was far far better than the five cheese pizza.  Far far better. The bartender was friendly as always."}
{"text":"Not what we expected. We ate at their other location on Rte 8 and it was much better. Beer selection was very limited, except drafts but we don't drink draft beer. They claim to carry Lagunitas and Founders but they didn't have their IPAs which are both top sellers. Go figure! Food was another disappointment. We ordered their buffalo chicken pizza and it was barely edible. Way too hot!. A sauce is meant to enhance the flavor, not numb your mouth. Nobody warned us that their buffalo sauce could wake up a mummy, and they should have. Last, service was slow.  Overall, not a great experience so they won't see us again."}
{"text":"I go back and forth on Caliente. On one hand, it has one of the best draft lists in the immediate area. On the other? The service, pricing, and food leave something to be desired.   The good first. Caliente's draft list is awesome, and I've really enjoyed my visits to the basement bar (open weekends). It's a very different feel than the upstairs bar and restaurant, which lacks any sort of atmosphere. Caliente's Happy Hour deals are fantastic--from 4:30 to 6:30 on weekdays the drafts are half off!   After Happy Hour, my issues with Caliente outweigh the positives. First off, the service is nonexistent. I can't blame this on the staff itself, I the place seems severely understaffed. Every time I've visited, servers are running around trying to help everyone out, and in the end, it takes about double the time to place orders or get drinks.   I don't mean this as a cheapskate, but I've found some of the pricing on the draft list to be off. Last night, the always awesome Big Hop was on tap for $6.50... for a smaller goblet. That's a hard pill to swallow, since you can walk across the street to Lot 17 for a $5-6 Big Hop in a pint glass. I do understand the high price for many of the rare beers, but this just seemed fishy to me.   I've eaten in several times, and everything has been meh. I mean, it's bar food, so nothing fancy, but I'd rather get a pie down the street.   I recommend visiting Caliente for Happy Hour, getting an order of the Buffalo Fries, and allowing plenty of time for the slow service."}
{"text":"Wanted some pizza and wings on a Friday and this place did not disappoint. Got there around 5:30/6 and didn't have to wait for a table. We sat downstairs. I got the pear arsenal cider which was amazing (and half off during happy hour). Personal pizzas were also $5 with one topping so I couldn't pass that up. It was everything you'd want a pizza to be. We also got two orders of wings (black and gold/honey Sriracha), which were phenomenal. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went there with a large group which they were very accommodating the pizza was good and the staff did a great job other than a bug in a water that they apologized for definitely will stop back"}
{"text":"I come to Caliente frequently. It has been one of my favorite bars and serves some of the best food I've ever eaten.   Last night, after a poor experience at a different bar, I encouraged my friends and coworkers to go to Caliente instead where I believed we would be treated to better beer, a kitchen that was still open, and much more generous hospitality.   When we arrived, we were not treated respectfully, our food was served to us in to-go boxes and we were made to feel as though we were being rushed out, all before 2am.   A number of the people in our group had never been to Caliente, so for them to have a disappointing first experience was disheartening and embarrassing.   To be fair, the food was still superb and the tap selection was diverse and displayed high levels of quality.   The difference is, Caliente is not the only restaurant/bar in Pittsburgh with those attributes. I am finished recommending this establishment to friends."}
{"text":"Amazing boneless wings and draft ciders! Our service is always super friendly here and quick so i definitely recommend. Also this is quality pizza  people!"}
{"text":"Damn the pizza is good! Bring it with pepperoni and ricotta, a couple of side salads and boneless wings and I'm good. It's about once a week for delivery.  UPDATE: The food is becoming more erratic from Caliente. The wings arrived tough. Again. The broccoli puffs got you the extra star."}
{"text":"The food was good but our waiter was bad. My girlfriend and I both ordered wings. She got boneless and got traditional. Her wings arrive first and they are traditional not boneless. The waiter then brings out her boneless wings and I still do not have my wings. After waiting for around an hour for my wings they finally arrive and they are good. I think the waiter just forgot to put my order in. I still gave him a 20% tip though because I believe in second chances."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had. I'm not even a crust eater and I had to eat the crust because it was SO good. Had the Grandma Sunseri pizza. The banana peppers added the perfect kick of flavor. Amazing draft beer selection, too. If you're into craft beers this is your place. I'll be back often."}
{"text":"Their pizza is pretty good and they have a great beer selection, but be prepared to wait over hour and a half to get your delivery order... Every time... Even when you live less than 2 miles away.  Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"My fiance ordered from here recently. After waiting almost 2 hours for our pizza to arrive, we called and asked what was going on, they said it would be there soon. Ten to fifteen minutes later it shows up and the driver informed us that they forgot to make the pizza. Any to top it all off we received some cardboard with a thousand dried up pepperoni slices on it. Wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Caliente has moved into the spot where Ordinary Joe's used to be. They've only been open for like a week, but we've already hit them up twice for delivery and once in the restaurant for dinner (don't judge!). It's been a bit of a mixed bag. When we dined in, we tried their pizza and buffalo chicken rolls. The dough they use for their pizza/breads/rolls is definitely distinct...it has a lightness and sweetness to it that makes it stand out from typical Pittsburgh pizza. I think maybe it's a bit less chewy, which I like. Their pizza sauce is a bit on the tart side, but because their crust is sweeter, it actually works well. As for atmosphere, it's pretty similar inside to how Ordinary Joe's was...clean and modern with a bit of a sports bar feel. It was quite busy when we went, and the service was not great (hopefully it's just opening-week kinks that are being worked out). The couple of times we ordered delivery, everything arrived quickly, but the food was more disappointing than it was when we dined in. The cheesy bread didn't come with sauce, and the Italian hoagie lacked Italian dressing (dry hoagie...gross). The buffalo chicken hoagie that we also ordered was not good...way overstuffed with fries, not very much chicken, and drenched with so much hot sauce that it was almost inedible (and I'm a girl who likes her food spicy!) Their fries in theory seem like they would be good (they're fresh cut), but they take no care to keep them crispy during delivery, so when they arrived, they were a soggy mess. Attention to detail seems to be sorely lacking for delivery orders, which is a shame.   Anyway, overall, the food was much better during our dine-in experience than delivery, so perhaps we'll stick with that (even though service needs to improve). They just opened, so hopefully things get better as they adjust to their new space. Until then, I can't give them much higher than a middling 3."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Caliente and have seen several deals on Groupon. After a crowded bar at Hemingways, we ventured over to Bloomfield for some late-night grub. This is was definitely a good plan B!  The atmosphere was pretty chill, we sat in the small dining room in the back of the bar. As the night went on, it got to be a bit crowded, but still decent enough to hear each other's conversations. The decor is pretty urban and has a city-feel to it.   I was impressed by their selection of beer. I'm not a beer-expert, but I feel like most fanatics would enjoy this place. Their specials were good and had lots of interesting choices!   We ordered an appetizer of loaded fries and a buffalo chicken pizza. The fries were awesome and massive! Definitely worth the money. They were thin-cut and fried perfectly. The pizza was great, too! It was my first time trying a buffalo chicken pizza so I was a bit apprehensive, but boy was it good! It did have a kick to it (good news for you hot sauce lovers out there!) that made me reach for my water quite often.  The only downfall was service. Our waitress was friendly, but wasn't around often. We als waited a decent amount of time for our food to come out. She did look like to have the whole dining room to herself, so I will give her the benefit of the doubt.   We will definitely be back soon to try some more! We tend to eat dinner later than most, so I love the luxury of a late-night kitchen!"}
{"text":"Still really pleased with Caliente. Great food and drink specials, food is always good. Service has been fine with a few stars in the server lineup. Good selection of bottles and drafts, food and drink prices all very reasonable.  But what is up with the super slippery wood floor in the back? I kinda feel like I'm ice skating back there."}
{"text":"I am rating this for eat in only. The pizza was awesome!! The loaded fries not so much, it was a very small serving and just bland. We had plenty of drink refills and ate downstairs during a planned event. I gave it a 4 based on the fact that one menu item was great and the other not. I would like to try it again but skipping the fries."}
{"text":"Place is awful.. Bad beer selection.. Poor service.. Bad tvs you can't hear anything.. Tip - get your food to go."}
{"text":"Went there with a group on a busy evening. The pizza was pretty good and so was the salad, but the rest left a lot to be desired.  The iced tea was awful. It was prefabricated--I'm guessing Lipton Brisk, not freshly brewed. I'd asked for no lemon, but it was lemon-flavored. The service was worse.  We arrived at 5:15 PM. We ordered by 5:30. We'd ordered the above-mentioned salads and three pizzas. The pizzas got to our table at 6:42! The server said she'd take 10% off after we'd waited for 40 minutes. When the pizza finally came, my brother asked to speak to the manager. The manager argued (!) with my brother about what was going on and then blamed short-staffing. My brother said we could have ordered for pick up and it would have been quicker. The manager said all orders were done in order.  Problem was, that another table had come in after us, ordered pizza after us, and had eaten and left before we got our pizza. There were major failures all-around and nobody would just confess to having made a mistake. They ended up giving us 25% off, but all-in-all, it was a terrible experience."}
{"text":"When you're a pizza joint in Pittsburgh (or any city, for that matter), you better have something awesome going for you or you'll just be another pizza place lost in the numbers. Count Caliente in the latter group.  Caliente really offers up nothing new or memorable, unfortunately. The service we had while sitting at the bar was poor. The bartender was nice, but she spent more time talking to her friend who wasn't even paying for anything than waiting on us and other customers who had empty beers at the other end of the bar.   The mozzarella sticks weren't very hot when they came out, but were still the delicious kind that I love, so I wasn't going to let it bother me. The only downside is that you only get 4 sticks. The bummer in that portion was only magnified when the rest of the meal left a lot to be desired.  My chicken parmesan hoagie was clearly made with frozen patties, and there wasn't a lot of cheese or sauce on the hoagie. I definitely wouldn't order it again if I, for some strange reason, was eating there again.  The white pizza we ordered was okay, but it was more of a bland cheesy bread than a white pizza. Very little flavor, very little cheese, and none of that garlic/oil/seasoning flavor that you expect with a white pizza.  It's not a bad bar, though. Decent beer selection (although a beer list would be nice on the menu). We also liked the actual atmosphere, even though it was dead while we were there. Unfortunately, without an improvement in service and food, I don't see it being full of customers on a regular basis any time soon."}
{"text":"Caliente's delivers to Pitt, which is important since I'm a student. I can't speak for other types of food, but the calzones and pizzas are phenomenal! The Parmesan and garlic topping on the crust of the calzone makes the dishes memorable. The owner, Nick, is a great guy who helped my organization out with pizza donations this previous summer."}
{"text":"The pizza is not bad, but the experience is pretty unpleasant. I've been twice and the A/C was out both times, so it was miserably hot. It took about 20 minutes for the server to ask for our order, even though it was a quiet night. They gave us the wrong toppings, but whatever, pizza was decent. They dropped it off on the table without plates or anything; we had to ask the bartender to bring some over. The staff was pretty rude. Another customer asked for a beer recommendation and the bartender snapped, \"I don't drink.\" The beer special was good - blood orange IPA 22oz for $5, but it was overall a very negative vibe."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza one night while at a friends house hanging out. They are a couple blocks from Caliente. We had it delivered so we could continue drinking on the porch. We just ordered a large pizza and it took over an hour do it to be delivered. The pizza itself was very tasty. It was very saucy but I like it that way. It was priced a little high for a large pizza especially when it took so long to deliver."}
{"text":"Starting off the food was good, great portion sizes, Lunch service was a little bit slow. Prices were average. Overall good place for a chill meal."}
{"text":"Great pizza and a really large selection of craft beers. Daily specials as well as happy hour special of $5 personal pizza and 1/2 price craft beer. Will be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Got a buffalo chicken pizza for pick up and weren't impressed.  There was very little chicken on it and we both felt that the chicken was really dry.  I expected more chicken (and better chicken) on the pizza for the price.  Pizza dough wasn't too bad; a little too thin under the toppings and the crust was a little too \"poofy,\" but it tasted pretty good.  I think it's a mistake that they put the ranch on top because it cools down the pizza too much.  We live ten minutes away and it was room temperature by the time we got it home.  This is the first pizza we've tried from this place, so maybe their other pizzas are better.  It was nice to try something new, but we'll stick with Frank's Pizza and Ephesus Pizza next time."}
{"text":"We got less than poor service - we got none whatsoever.  Went on a Thursday night with my two boys, got a table right away.  That was the best part of the night.  We waited 15 minutes before anyone took a drink order, and we never did get any menus.   At that time I ordered loaded fries as an appetizer.  They never came.  I also ordered a large pepperoni pizza.    After 45 minutes and a request to see the manager,  he put the pizza down in front of us.  I had to ask for plates, napkins, and utensils.  Then the fries came.  Had to ask again for salt/pepper and ketchup.  Never at any point did anyone even ask if we needed our drinks refilled or anything.  I actually left without tipping (which I NEVER do, having once worked for tips)  because the server basically treated us like she was doing us a favor.  Too bad for her because I usually tip a MINIMUM of 20%, more when we get good service.   Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Always sucks rating someplace great that, in all probability, I'll never visit again. Went to Caliente for the second time with my son who recently moved out of Pittsburgh. He loved Caliente and so did I. This is your a-typical dive bar with really good drinks, an excellent beer menu and pizza that's well, to die for. They've actually won national pizza contests, something that is abundantly clear upon your first bite.   Service is friendly and attentive with prices that are more than reasonable. I also love the Pittsburgh themed wall murals painted throughout the back room. Hell, I even kind of liked the cramped men's room with partially revealing stall door.   Leaving Pittsburgh this time was bittersweet. I'll miss vising my son there and a few really great places to eat and drink. Of these, Caliente was definitely a favorite. Just wish it wasn't a 7 hour drive away."}
{"text":"I love Caliente! Their food is good, beer list makes me very happy, and the service is usually great. My visit on 10/24/15 was a bit of an exception. The waitress who acknowledged us told us she would bring us waters and my friend and I already knew what beers we wanted, so she brought us our beers but never water. We had just left a wedding across the street and had time to kill before the reception and specifically stated that we were starving, but she never came back with menus."}
{"text":"I love Caliente. The Bloomfield location is amazing and the Hampton location has improved significantly. However, the Aspinwall location doesn't do the brand justice. I fear that the saturation point is near and am very hopeful that it doesn't place a strain on the other locations and lower their quality.   Been here a couple times. The food takes a LONG time. Salads took over 20 minutes this evening and the appetizer took 35. Yes, the app came out 15 minutes later. The homemade dressings (ranch and blue cheese) were as thin as water and flavorless. The buffalo chicken rolls had a piece of chicken in 3/6 of the rolls and were very small and dry. The other locations' buffalo chicken rolls are fluffy, doughy, full of filling, and are perfectly cooked with garlic butter on top. Ordered two buffalo chicken salads. Veggies throughout the salad were perfect as they always were. However, the two salads were entirely different. My wife's salad had what I can only guess was the hottest sauce they make. I love hot things and typically order things as hot as they can be made. Even to me, this heat level was at the very top of my scale.   Will choose to go to Bloomfield from now on. The two star review is based on my adoration for the other locations. Otherwise, would've been 1-Star."}
{"text":"Delicious!"}
{"text":"This used to be our go to spot for late night eats and a couple drinks until I bit down on a staple that somehow found its way into my burger. Fortunately, it only hit my teeth. I haven't been back since. The only saving grace that night was our waitress, who was awesome and checked in with us just the right amount. They didn't charge me for the burger and offered $10 credit for next time but they charged us for everything else. It wasn't enough to compensate for what could have been a much worse situation and I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"If you're going to charge for ranch, it would be nice if you actually included it in the delivery more than 25% of the time when it is ordered."}
{"text":"Parking: metered street parking is available. The side streets might be free or resident permit, I'm not sure.  Pizza: sweet baby Jesus in a tuxedo suit. Whatever kind you get, make sure it's pan. The dough was perfectly cooked! Fluffy on the inside, crispy all around the edges. We got the chicken ranchero (I believe). Grilled juicy chicken, the most excellent homemade ranch, bacon, cheese...what's not to like!?  Beer: they have a bottle case as well as a pretty decent draft list so you'll always find something you'll like."}
{"text":"Went here for a happy hour. My friend ordered a pizza and I ordered a chicken salad. The salad came out about 10-15 minutes before the pizza. That was a little annoying because I was hungry and didn't want to be rude and eat in front of my friend. So I waited until here pizza came and by then my chicken on my salad was cold. If you can even call it chicken, it was rubbery and gross. But my friends pizza was good, I like th crust. Even if the chicken was warm the salad was still pretty gross. The beer selection is ok but overpriced unless you are ya there for happy hour. Overall I only like this place for the pizza everything else is mehhh"}
{"text":"One star is just for the ability to post this...I wish I had read some of the other delivery reviews prior to ordering, but Caliente had messed up my orders in small ways twice in the past. The first they forgot my dressing and one of the minor vegetables was missing from my salad. I could overlook it. The second time I ordered the delivery was beyond the estimated wait time. This time, I waited 10 minutes beyond the estimated delivery time to call the restaurant to ask where the food was. They purposely picked up the phone and hung it up on me three or four times. When a girl with a bad attitude finally picked up they told me my order was out for delivery, and it wasn't, because it took another 20 minutes to get to me (1.5hrs later), and I live less than 5 minutes away! When I finally went to meet the delivery boy he seemed under the influence of something...slurred, slow speech, and delayed response time. What he gave me did not seem to be all of the food, and I told him to wait...sure enough one of my items was completely missing, and when I brought the rest in, it was cold as ice, and completely unenjoyable. I am now waiting for the rest of it to show up, but I'm doubtful I will see it because he assured me they 'were closing early' tonight. I'll never order from them again. Absolutely terrible customer service, and cold, missing food certainly isn't what anyone orders for. Plenty of other good delivery places to try in the same area , I'm sure. They need to get their acts together. It's embarassing."}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars because I'm not going full anger mode on a bad experience. I understand that you can't blame wait staff for slow food, and I will never tip a server less than 18% (I'm in the service industry myself) but we just had pretty crap service at 4pm on a Monday. They weren't busy, we waited forever for our food and the bartender was kind of sh*++y about splitting our check in half, which I would have done for him np. I will say the food was alright but it wasn't really worth the grief of the wait and the attitude. Anyway, I don't write bad reviews typically but this is my second bad experience here sooooo."}
{"text":"Pizza was delivered in a timely fashion but it was burned and almost inedible. The cheese bread was even just average. I will not be ordering here again."}
{"text":"Food arrived late, which wouldn't be a big deal if it weren't stone cold as well. Everyone was hungry and didn't want to deal with waiting another hour so we microwaved it. Steak Sandwich was about 90% lettuce and looked like trash. Terrible because I've always enjoyed Calientes food but this seriously will be my last order."}
{"text":"I've tried Caliente's pizza and rolls (buffalo chicken and the spinach and artichoke), and the dough is phenomenal. It's so chewy and fresh-- yum. My only recommendation for Caliente would be to focus less on IPAs on their draft list and include some more wheat beer options."}
{"text":"Almost thought I walking into Pipers Pub at first, and the place sure looks like just that. Stopped by on a Thursday evening and place was somewhat busy. We got served right away. They have a decent draft beer selection,  and the subs we had were alright. Service was good!"}
{"text":"REVIEW FOR Castle Shannon Blvd Location.  Imagine, if you will, planning a bridal shower for your future daughter in law. You take the reins on location and food, because of course, you have an establishment in mind that you always use. You book the party, send out the invites. You're confident you are gonna be the cool future mother in law. Then ten days before the event you find out the trusty go to place has been sold and the new owners will take over .... two days before the party. Not only that, they are completely redecorating. Under normal circumstances that would be a cause for panic and excessive drinking, possibly a minor temper tantrum and freak out, but that not happen when Caliente Pizza took over the old Pub and Pizza.  The owner Angela reached out to me before the event, and Lou (Marylou) made sure we communicated details and the transition went smoothly. I was treated wonderfully by the new owners almost as if they had known me  forever. She walked me through the menu planning and even saved me money by not letting me over order, assuring me that more food, if need was an order away.  The new improved, redecorated upstairs party room was awesome. I was super pleased at how fast it was done and loved the new look and floors. It was clean and refreshing.  Laurie was our server in charge and she did a spectacular job of keeping all drinks filled, tables cleared, food brought out in a timely manner. She was fun and positive. I liked Angela kept checking on things, too.  The food was above and beyond what I expected. The Broccoli puff were addictively delicious, the zucchini was crisp, tasty and perfect. I ordered the 'Ten for' hoagie platter and got a variety, the guest raved about them all, I particularly like the Italian hoagie. I wished I could have sampled them all. In addition I ordered pizzas. Three of them., Simply delicious with a sturdy crust, sweet chunky sauce and the right amount of toppings. The pizzas were such a hit, I had to order more. Oh, wait, did I mention the antipasta salad? Hello? Heaven in a bowl.  The staff and food is second to none and I highly recommend Caliente Pizza for private parties, catering and dining. I plan on having them be my new 'go to' place, and have already placed a catering order for an event in four weeks.  On a personal side note, I just want to thank Angela, Laurie and staff for going above and beyond to take care of my mom who had just gotten out of the hospital. They made her feel very welcome and catered to her special needs."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go for delicious food in all of Bloomfield. I'm sure of it. I love, love, love their Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza. Their pepperoni rolls are great. Unbelievably large portions for the money. The employees are super friendly. One time, a delivery to my place got mixed up, and they fixed the issue right away. I wish they had a bigger location, it gets kinda cramped in there when they're busy. Good people. Good food. Good everything."}
{"text":"My husband and I order from here when we are feeling like not cooking or going out! It's a good place to order in and it is always great food! We love the Hawaiian Pizza!"}
{"text":"We went to this place this past weekend and had an incredible experience. It was for a surprise birthday party so we had the whole downstairs to ourselves minus the bar. The server immediately took our Beverage orders as soon as we say down. Once everyone showed up he quickly took our food orders. We ordered a large pizza half pepperoni and half cheese and it was really good. The crust was perfect, the sauce tasted homemade and had a perfect flavor texture to it and the pepperoni and cheese were just right. We also got a ranchero steak sub and it was amazing. Great steak, Fresh cut French fries, and ranch dressing. The bread was perfectly toasted and the steak was very flavorful. Everyone else in our group enjoyed their food as well. The server was outstanding all night long. We will be back to this place for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered a small BBQ pizza. There was barely anyone there and it took quite a long time to get my beer (I had a half day at work so I had to celebrate!). The pizza also took sometime. For a place I thought would be a quick lunch, it ended up being an hour. So if you are in a hurry I recommend to stay away! The pizza was good, but nothing to write home about. I may be back to see if I get a better experience. The beers they have on tap are fantastic so I think it may be worth the try."}
{"text":"Met up at Caliente's with a social group that I belong to yesterday after work for \"drinking practice\".  I must say that I was very impressed with the selection of beers on tap. It's a rarity for me to find a bar that has quality craft beers on tap that I have not yet tried or haven't had in a long time. Caliente's sure did deliver in that respect.   I started out having a long time favorite of mine, Bell's Third Coast Old Ale. It was correctly served in sniffer glass and it went down just right. I followed it up with the Brew Gentleman's Mammoth, then a Bullfrog Blackberry JuJu, a Draai Laag Yodeler, Lost Abbey Lost and Found, a Free Will Barbera Grape and finished the evening off with a Dogfish Head Raison D Extra. Nice selection of beers eh? I think so. And the best part about it was that most of the brews were consumed during happy hour meaning that they only cost me $3.50 each!  We started our \"drinking practice\" on the first floor of Caliente's then as our group grew to double digits we took it down stairs. Both locations were comfortable and accommodating yet distinctly different from one another. The first floor had a more \"old skool\", traditional Pittsburgh pub feel to it contrasting with the metro kind of lounge atmosphere of the basement. It was like bar hopping without the benefit of enjoying every one of those February 8 degrees that we were blessed with outside yesterday evening  I'd be remiss if I didn't comment on the pizza at Caliente's. The group I was with ordered a number of pizzas and I had the opportunity to enjoy a few slices of the Meat Lover's pizza and a few slices of a BBQ Chicken with Pineapple pizza. They were both delicious and could stand toe to toe with just about any Italian pie in the Burgh.   I can't say enough good things about this place. If you appreciate good craft beers and enjoy Pizza, this is the place for you. If I lived a little closer to Bloomfield, I would most certainly be a regular of Caliente's."}
{"text":"Pizza was okay, actually tasted better reheated the second day. Went with a group of people, and the servers were a bit slow refilling pitchers of water, getting orders etc. Out of the draft special of the day, Yuengling at 1130am on a Saturday - they open at 11."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Caliente so many times, but I've never had the pleasure of trying their craft-beer selection or great happy-hour deals. My review focuses on my most recent visit.   Two nights ago my boyfriend and I were hanging out a friends, and we were crazy hungry at about 10pm. Caliente was suggested and chosen. We went for their five-cheese calzone and jalapeno poppers.   The food took about an hour to arrive, which I guess makes sense for a late night. We probably should have just walked there, but we were too lazy to do that, plus we were gaming.   The food arrived and it looked amazing. The calzone was definitely big enough for two people, but certainly could have fed three. At first bite I was in love. Cheesy deliciousness danced around my tongue and my hunger was sated. I was a bit of a challenge to eat it all though, so I shared with my friend.   The jalapeno poppers were pretty tasty too. They weren't overly fried or greasy. They were just right! They could have been spicier though.   There's not a lot else I can say about Caliente. Their pizza and food is consistently delicious, they employ friendly people and the price is right for what you get. I highly recommend Caliente and some of their great happy-hour deals."}
{"text":"Really great pizza, but the service was lacking. Waitress was definitely bummed out to \"deal\" with us. I've never understood this. I served for a long time and more customers just meant more money. Anyway, pizza is excellent and the choices are awesome. The buffalo chicken was great!"}
{"text":"It's sad to write this review because we are first timers here. My husband loves craft beer and I like cider. They only had two ciders, and one was out. Then I tried the other, after one glass that was out also.   Moving on to the food. We asked our waitress (who was nice but had friends at the next table so was less than attentive to us) what a good one would be. We were debating between fried zucchini and cheesy bread- well, we got both for some reason. We didn't order both, but because of the waitress paying attention to her friends I don't believe she was paying much attention to our order. Sadly, we didn't try the pizza after two appetizers.   I watched the waitress serve the table in front of us (that she knew) free drink after free drink, but couldn't remember to bring us napkins. It was mostly because she was socializing with her friends about getting high and reminiscing. I don't mind if you know people, but please give others the same service.   I asked for wine, they only had two reds and a white. I took the white, and then we decided to leave after that. We still had no napkins, or refills on water. Overall, the atmosphere is hot, small, and personally good if you know the workers. If you don't know the workers, you might be fucked."}
{"text":"Really great pizza! Came in late on a Sunday night and the pizza was out of this world and service was great!"}
{"text":"I have always had decent delivery service from here and frankly their pizza and greek salad are so good.  I have had a hard time finding other pizza joints as reliably good with so many fresh vegetables and toppings. The spinach rolls seem to always have the bottoms burned, but still tasty.  They are not the most polite, but for me, my food as always been good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Ok so this place has really good pizza and I hate pizza..  the other food is also yummy.. however, the service is horrible. No one waits on you in bar area if you track someone down she will put your order in but don't expect to ever see her again  they bring food with not even a napkin let alone plastic ware.. the girls behind the bar, just stand there we waited 15 minutes before finally getting up to to get our own to-go container before we paid our bill at the bar."}
{"text":"Given the convenience of the location and the consistently awesome selection of beers at Caliente, I would assume this would be one of our regular spots.  Sadly, not so.  We've been here a handful of times (maybe 5?) and have been disappointed every time.  While the beer selection is great, the prices are simply outrageous.  A 22oz specialty beer for $19?  I've found the same beers at around $12-$14 in other spots.  Our experience with the food is limited.  The only thing we've tried is the fried zucchini, but it was pretty awful.  Limp, flavorless mush with a side of marinara that was basically just plain tomato sauce.  We have avoided their pizzas on the assumption that the same sauce is used.  Despite the over-priced beer and mediocre food, we may have continued to pop in from time to time, but for our 2 most recent experiences which made me feel like the management/ownership of this place is just downright dishonest.  Caliente has taken to advertising pint nights (buy a beer, keep the glass).  The first one we tried to go to, we got there around 9:45, and were informed that they were out of glasses.  They said the special started at 7.  OK, that's not unreasonable.  So the next time, we got there around 7:20.  What do you know?  Out of glasses.  The manager looked at me and said, \"They go fast!\"  That may be true, but then: get more glasses!  I don't need free glassware to patronize a place, but I do find it extremely insulting when a business advertises something like this to get you through the door, then doesn't deliver.  Running out of a special in 20 minutes isn't a special - it's a fire sale.  The beer selection may be good, but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was here for the Belgian Tap Takeover and had a few too many Fat Tires.   It's a really small place, but it's cozy and the staff is friendly. And while I can't speak to the food, the fact that they had a fun, hip event makes Caliente's a pretty awesome place."}
{"text":"Meh.  It was recommended by a friend for great pizza, but I found it to be standard, no frills, so so, pizza sold by all the delivery shops along Penn and Liberty.  OK, if not odd, craft beer selection offered at high prices ($8-9 for tulips or sniffers).  Good cheerful service saved this place from two stars."}
{"text":"We Waited a good 6 minutes before being acknowledged. So we went to the bar and asked if we could just seat ourselves. We sat ourselves, waited 10 minutes for menus, never got waters, just menus. After 10 minutes of waiting after we decided on our food we left since nobody ever came back."}
{"text":"Kay and I stopped into Caliente for a post-work pie late last week and were delighted to find that its buttery cheese, dulcet, snap-your-fingers-snap-your-neck sauce and chewy-as-a-Southside-Pretzel crust made it an easy contender for one of the East End's very best. We got no askew looks for requesting the Kay Kombo, and with beverages and tip, our total was still less than 20 dollars.  On the atmosphere tack,  I have no idea what Caliente becomes like as the night grinds forward, but when we visited around 5PM, the bar was rather quiet and calm, and Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations was on the telly. Having written that, I feel that Caliente was a pleasant, inexpensive choice for a payday Friday night dinner, and I think you will also if you visit.   P.S. Maria, our server, was an absolute sweetheart."}
{"text":"Love this place! The daily deals are awesome! And you can't beat the Happy Hour! Way better than Ordinary Joe's!!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. Nothing special but will do the trick on a late night when everything else is closed. I can't rate it any higher because of the awful service. I've been here several times and every time, no matter the server or bartender, I've received either rude service or had to work hard to get staff's attention to order something. After my last visit, which included repeatedly having to ask for my drink, being charged incorrectly for my meal, and witnessing staff openly talk negatively about other customers who were also going out of their way just to order food and drinks in this place, I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Don't ever order delivery from Caliente.  They just lost my business and the department I work for - business.  We called at 6:10 to place an order for 3 extra large pizzas.  It took 20+ minutes to even place the order because whoever was doing it did not know what they were doing. They asked for the address 3 times, the phone number twice, and what the order was at least twice. However - I was told the pizza would be delivered in 30 minutes.  Fantastic.    Well - I finally call at 7:15 to find out where my order is - cause it's been almost an hour.  Turns out - they wrote the wrong phone number down - and didn't bother coming to the building.  I sat in the lobby of the hospital for 30 minutes - wasting time - waiting.  They re-delivered the pizza - but it took another 20 minutes.  Another 20 minutes?!  I swear he walked, cause no cars pulled up.    After over an hour of wasted time and not even an apology when I called (I was scolded for not answering the phone).  It's not worth it to waste our money there.    Did I mention the pizza was cold when it was delivered?  Not even warm.  Cold.    Tread carefully."}
{"text":"Came to Pittsburgh to visit our son.  Looking for good pizza and good beer and found it!  Between the 4 of us got two types of pizza, a calzone and a sub and all were delicious.  Fast, friendly service too.  Try it out."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with saying it was Not my first visit to Calienti's.    On Saturday, and I understand establishments were busy because of the Festival, what we experienced indicated a total disregard of a business to its customers. And that's why I'm writing this.   First of all the upstairs bar seemed to be short staffed and the bartenders not experienced nor motivated enough to keep up with the flow. People at the high tops were told that if they wanted a beer, they would have to wait for it at the bar. I saw $30 tabs being rung, and $2 tips. I wanted to jump in and return to my college day's job. Let me jump in. I'd have been thrilled to pour my customers beers. And I would not have had a $2 tip. I'd have made money!  I mean, what an opportunity to rock and roll. Totally lost.  Second, many of the beers had kicked and the excuse was \"we're too busy to put new ones on.\"  Hel-lo management!?!  Step up to the plate and help the staff to do what you want your bartenders to do. SELL Beer. Not to say, kicked, kicked and oh, that's kicked too. See where this is going?  Third and also disappointing. The bathroom at the bottom of the steps was deplorable, ladies room on the main floor has been out of service for what? A year? Mentioned to the one bartender about the disgusting bathroom and she said, \"do you mean from last night? Oh, we're too busy to take care of that.\"  And walked away!  Last but not least. There is a huge sign stating best happy hour in town. I agree that when its not \"all kicked\" there is a great selection of beers which I've enjoyed during happy hour as well as other times of the day. However, your competitors, and I know you know who they are, use 12-0z pours for the high octanes not 10-oz pours. The price is comparable but you get less.   Calienti's really missed a great opportunity to shine over this weekend. Those of us who go there will continue to do so, but for those people who may have stopped in for the first time?  As they say, you can only get one chance at a good first impression......"}
{"text":"The BEST pan pizza I've ever had is at Caliente - so delicious! Typically I've only had takeout from Caliente, but it's a fun place to stop in and sit as well. The spinach and feta rolls are also out of this world. Probably wouldn't order take out fries again - ours were soggy and a bit disappointing, but I think ordering them while at the restaurant would make a difference. They have so many different fry options if you're a fry lover like me. Caliente is one of my go-tos for all things comfort food!"}
{"text":"everyone needs to try the broccoli bites, first off. probably the best ever. i also had the greek pizza which was also delicious. prices are reasonable as well. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars, is that the service wasn't the best ever. there were no servers, just the bartender, and he was rather slow and we had to ask for water refills. (the bar section wasn't busy either) but he was friendly, so i can't complain too much. i'd definitely go back. oh, another bonus: they serve pizza super late!"}
{"text":"Finally, a pizza place worth raving about in Pittsburgh!  So Caliente looks like a typical bar from the outside but the inside seems like it's in limbo between bar and restaurant.  The menus are takeout menus - what?  Yeah, this got my expectations really low but when the food came out I was pleasantly surprised.  The Caesar Salad was nice and big and the dressing automatically came on the side.  The garlic bread (only 99 cents!) was delicious with just the right amount of crunch.  The personal pepperoni pizza had all the things I look for in a pizza - just enough grease, great amount of toppings, and not too much crust.  The pesto pasta also didn't come out dripping in oil - very hard to find.    I will be coming back or ordering from here whenever I get my pizza cravings.  They deliver to Shadyside!  Seriously, give it a try.  Great value."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to a new city, beer and wine spots are the first things I look for. I happened to stumble across Caliente Pizza by accident while searching for a winery. It popped up on google maps and I was like pizza AND draft beers - hello heaven. I clicked on the link and was immediately drawn in by the draft list. It was beautiful. Then I saw a picture of the pizza and I was sold. I like to pride myself in being a self proclaimed pizza connoisseur and my husband loves beer so we knew we had to try this place. I sent them a tweet in my excitement and they replied to me a few hours later seeming equally as excited (I love when places interact with their customers on social media!) So we show up on a Friday night and the place is packed, but we expected it. It's Friday and they had a special flight night going on. We get seated within a few minutes in the downstairs basement area that has another bar and some TVs. It was great. I ordered a half cheese and half pepperoni pizza (I like to judge a pizza place by how well they can do a basic style) and my husband got a steak calzone. My pizza was pretty good, but the crust was a little lacking in flavor so I asked for a side of ranch dressing, which is house made and fantastic, and BAM that pizza was perfect. Now, pizza and ranch may not be your thing but seriously try it. My husband's calzone took a little longer than we would have liked but again it was a busy Friday night and calzones take longer to cook by nature so he just kept chugging along with his flight of beer and stole a few bites of my pizza. All was well.  The best part is that one of the owners saw my check-in/tweet about being at Caliente and stopped by our table to ask how everything was. HOW IS THAT FOR SERVICE? Angie was a sweetheart and Caliente pizza will be a MUST STOP place for us anytime we are in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"OK food, but delivery takes FOR-FREAKING-EVER. I'm sorry, but 2 hours for an order of cheesy bread is outrageous. The beers are overpriced, as well. If you're going to eat here, I'd suggest dine-in or pick up."}
{"text":"The food is great if you're dining in. Delivery, beware. They have messed up multiple orders in the past but tonight was the last time I'll be ordering from them. Pizza arrived a little under two hours after ordering. Cold. Driver forgot the credit card receipt, leaving me to stand outside while he ran back to his car. When I opened up the pizza, which was pepperoni and extra sauce, I found two large containers of marinara, smashing two of the pieces of pizza down. I can't even fathom how anyone who works at a pizza shop could possibly think that's what extra sauce means.... I'll never order again. Try Ephesus instead!"}
{"text":"Not a fan...  I've ordered delivery from here (with coworkers) several times since I work late nights.    The food has never been anything to rave over in my opinion. The last time we ordered, we received half of a pizza that we didn't order.  It might have been fine if it was a whole pizza for free, but it was peculiar.    Additionally,  they always forget the ranch...  If you love hot wings with ranch,  and don't have any ranch...  The wings become pointless.   Also, one of the 'grubhub' drivers isn't very nice. Not sure of her name, but she drives a green car.   Bottom line- it's open late, they have a lot of options on the menu, and they deliver. We only keep giving chances due to the above."}
{"text":"I've ordered late night delivery for pizza, pasta ans wings as an experiment. Everything sucked. I will never order from them again."}
{"text":"I had never reviewed Caliente when it was under the previous ownership and I'm glad I didn't for the new owners, who happen to be awesome.  The atmosphere is much of what you would expect from a bar.  People jabbering away and TV's in the background with sports, all standard good stuff.  The decor is in the process of changing with the new owners, more cool stuff on the wall and the addition of the chalkboard paint listing all the tap brews (all 20) is really cool.  What makes Caliente welcoming is the staff, none of who I have ever had an issue with... From the handy man to the owners, they know how to treat patrons.  As for the food, it is pretty damn good.  The pizza is, in my opinion, the best in Bloomfield.  It is obvious that they use fresh ingredients, many of which I believe are local.  The wings are solid and the sandwiches are put on superb bread, which I think makes or breaks most sandwiches.  Drinking!  If you like craft beer then Caliente is your place to go in Bloomfield... The selection on tap is fantastic with Hercules Double IPA, Raging Bitch Belgium IPA and Dogfish Head Burton and Baton only to name a few... There is 20 on tap in total and one will not find a miller lite or bud light in the mix... IF you prefer bottles, well they have two full coolers full of craft brews, including my personal favorite, Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA...  And for you hipsters, they most certainly have Pabst Blue Ribbon available...  You can't go wrong with Caliente."}
{"text":"I love caliente but I had the worst service this past Saturday. The one blonde bartender was way too worried about talking to her friends and being on her cell phone that she never came over to get a drink order from a friend that sat down and joined. We had to go up to the bar to ask if someone could take this order. There was clearly confusion on who was waiting tables because the other bartender was like \"oh I she said she was taking his order\". If she wanted to be on her phone and with her friends then she shouldn't be at work. I will still go back to caliente because the food and beer is great but please have the employees realize they are at work for a reason."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. Great food, great beer, and I live in the neighborhood. I've been there a handful of times and the service is pretty bad. On my last visit, my date and I were seated downstairs and waited about ten minutes until we were approached by our server/bartender. She did not know the specials so I had to walk back upstairs and ask another server. Our food-a salad and pizza-took over an hour, and after I finished my first drink I waited long enough until I went back upstairs to order another one. It was not busy. Our server had two deuces (including us), one four top, and one guy at the bar. She spent the entire two hours we were there with an earbud in staring at her phone. It was a frustrating experience, but the food was great! I'm not sure I'll be going back though."}
{"text":"Will keep this review simple. Facebook review was deleted, I guess I was too descriptive. Ive spent a few late nights at caliente in the last month of two having drinks and grabbing a late night bite. Earlier this week I saw not one, but two roaches run across the bar. It was late and not busy, I'd imagine they dont come out if theres alot of people there during busy hours. A laundry list of other things.. filthy cooks bringing food out, yelling and cursing coming from the kitchen, rude servers and bartenders, overheard staff badmouthing management and even overheard servers talking about rats they have seen. The entire place is absolutely filthy. Dont let the fancy advertising fool you. This place is a sham and a shame.   IF YOURE AT THE \"RESTARAUNT\" FOR DRINKS ONLY, DO NOT GET FOOD. IVE SEEN THE ROACHES WITH MY OWN TWO EYES."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such mixed reviews...every time we've been here we have gotten great food and great service! One of my favorite pizza places in Pittsburgh within walking distance from home...hard to say no to that!"}
{"text":"I was originally going to order Chinese but decided on pizza at the last minute. After being in an acute care facility for 28 days I deserved a treat.  Calling and ordering was a breeze and the delivery (for one in the morning) was fast. That deserved a $5.00 but I wish i would have asked for some plates or thick napkins.   Found a new place to order from - now all I have to do is talk them into having a family special or family freak feast!  If you are ordering this to be delivered to a work address or other institutional facility, never fear, the driver I had tonight called twice - once when leave the shop and one when he arrived here"}
{"text":"Knocked off a star because of the service.   It's not that the bartenders and servers are bad - they're all lovely - it's that whomever is scheduling them is horrific at their job .Constantly understaffed. If you're running specials everynight and draw a moderate to full crowd, you need more than one person. The staff is apologetic about it and it's not enough to keep me away but holy crap man, take some burden off your employees for god's sake.  Last four times I have been the wait times for service have been on the absurd side, you're doing nobody a favor here.  ------  Cannot believe I've waited so long to go here, kicking myself for wasting time with the smaller pizzerias (no offense).  Went on a Sunday, great specials on the pizza. I think it was 13 dollars for an XL pizza and you get four toppings for free. The pizza was delicious, went with spinach, feta two times, and ricotta, nice greek pizza. Got a side of fries which were quite tasty and fairly priced, big portion too.  GREAT beer selection, server knew her stuff and suggested a peanut butter porter which was phenomenal.   Cool place too, lots of TVs and seating. They have good specials every night on food and booze, will definitely be making Sunday nights pizza night now."}
{"text":"The best part about Caliente (besides the good pizza and good pours) is the downstairs speakeasy. When it's crowded upstairs it's a great place to chill with your drinks of choice and food. Great burgers and pizza too."}
{"text":"I feel compelled to give Caliente a glowing review, because this place has one of the best-curated, most interesting draft beer lists in town.  Perhaps the very best.  It is a must-stop location for Pgh beer lovers.  Add to that they have half-priced craft drafts from 4:30-6:30 on week nights, which makes a good thing ridiculously great.    Food-wise, it has solid pizza and bar food.      It wasn't special, but it was satisfying.  Did I mention the beer??? Go for that."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Pizza is the best and I love their selections in meads and beer. Just have to say the kitchen management needs to get it together a bit. Came last night with a friend and she ordered a veggie burger, provolone sticks and I ordered simple pepperoni rolls. 30 minutes after giving our order the waiter came out and said they don't have veggie burgers. It would have been helpful to know that ahead of time. So my friend got her provolone sticks about 20 minutes after that and I was still left waiting for my pepperoni rolls. It's now an hour and I finally get my Pepperoni rolls . Again food is great but kitchen management needs to be worked on. Last time I went there their special cupcakes advertised on the menu weren't available either. Please update you menu as well ."}
{"text":"Food was good when it finally arrived... Service was barely ok. Bartender/waitress brought every item for four people ONE  ITEM AT A TIME OVER AN HOUR. It was ridiculous. It was not busy at all and she was not worried about it. An antipasto salad, a fish sandwich, buffalo chicken rolls and a pepperoni pizza. Not real difficult. She said she had no control as she stood at the bar on her phone and talked to two or three regulars. Worst service ever since I've been there. I love the place. Very sad."}
{"text":"Love the beer selection, pizza, and happy hour specials.  Their draft list could be one of the best in the 'burgh, and they supplement that with a wide variety of bottle options.  Caliente offers daily food and drink specials and happy hour deals.  You can't beat half off craft drafts during happy hour!  So why three stars?  Each time I've been there, they typically only have a manager on staff and a bartender who is doubling as a waitress for the whole place.  The staff is always friendly, but for-sure overworked.  Don't expect to come in here and get out quick, and you may wait in between drinks longer than you'd like.  They offer special events, like karaoke, live music, and trivia night.  Hope to check those out in the future!"}
{"text":"There was a wait for a table, but the staff was very attentive, provided frequent updates on the status of our wait, and offered a drink at the bar. The pizza and salad were delicious.  Beer selection was awesome. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza is some of the best in Pittsburgh but time and time again I go in there and get the worst service in the city.  This time, my last, all I wanted to do is put in a to-go order for a pizza. I walked up to the bar, waited 10 minutes before the bartender even acknowledged me. Asked what I wanted to drink and I told her I'd like to place an order. Hands me a menu (I already knew what I wanted) and immediately walks away without taking the order.   She then starts talking with other people. Hugging what I assume were her friends for another 5 minutes. Then gives me a water. (Still hasn't taken my pizza order yet). Walks back and forth another 5 min and then FINALLY asks what I want to eat.   This is the norm here. Getting ignored from servers and bartenders and getting terrible service when you finally get their attention. Acting like you're doing someone a favor is not how you treat people coming to your restaurant. But, that's the price you pay for above average pizza and good beer selection I guess."}
{"text":"I came here on the groupon and I must say this place gets very high marks. The food was really good the pizza was perfect. I had the Thai chilli wings and the sauce was the best I've had ever. GREAT beer selection with good beers on tap and in bottles. Great and knowledgeable service . This place is a win."}
{"text":"I've been to Caliente a few times now and I love it. The pizza is good, the buffalo pizza is delicious, the steak salad is also delicious, the loaded fries are amazing. Service can be a little slow, but it's always busy so I can let that slide. The food is worth it! I work nearby, so I'll continue to eat here for the foreseeable future. I can't get enough of this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered some pizza and fish sandwiches from here through their online ordering system. Placed my order at 1030am, it was easy to use and got a confirmation etc. The worst part is that the pizza was supposed to be here at 12pm but never showed up until 115pm. Everything was cold, pizza was all slammed to one side of the box and ice cold. Fish sandwiches were cold and the fries were just a big glob of grease. I would not order from here again for delivery ever."}
{"text":"Great experience here! We had one of those city cards that give you $10 off of $30, and we decided to try it out on an early Monday evening.  We ordered the broccoli poppers and house salad. My husband said that that was how broccoli should be-surrounded by cheese and bacon and then fried. Lol. They were delicious! The house salad was fresh and the balsamic dressing topped it off nicely. We ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza, and it was very good.  Service was pleasant, and the draft selection was great-very diverse."}
{"text":"The pizza here is great, delicious and a good price. Sometimes the service lacks because it is also a bar (which I also enjoy) but when you come for dinner or the happy hour pizza you have to wait longer than expected."}
{"text":"Being a business owner in the area I love to try new places with clients (When time permits) I had the opportunity to enjoy a slice during Lil Italy Days and wanted to eat in this time....We picked up a Living Social Deal and headed on over.... We had a gyro with fries and HAD to try the wings!!  The food and the service was great!!  Loved the murals on the wall done by a local artist. We will definitely return for full price this time!!!"}
{"text":"I love your wings. They're delicious. The fact that you charge customers for carrots and celery is utterly ridiculous. That's like saying, \"yeah I know it's free at literally every restaurant across the United States, but fuck you I'm going to charge you for them.\" Oh and I bought them and they were dried out and old. So they fuck you twice. Change this and I'll give you 5 stars."}
