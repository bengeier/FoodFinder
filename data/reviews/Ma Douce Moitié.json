{"text":"Very good place to take a brunch. I went two weeks ago and I found out this place was cosy and waiters very kind. You can create your own smoothie and the presentation and food quality are original."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the rather goofy sounding concept of \"brunch tapas.\" This place is totally unpretentious and the food is a super good value. Their candied bacon brings tears of joy to my eyes."}
{"text":"MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

So very good. Amazing quality of food. Creative menu items. Every time I go I want to order something different. I always end up eating too much because it's all so delicious!!!!!!

This is the restaurant to beet in Montreal: Price versus quality = The best!!!"}
{"text":"This is how breakfast is supposed to be. I tried the sweet and savoury french toast and it was exactly what i imagined. This is my second time here and my first time ordering off the menu because i can't get passed ordering the scones. The service is incredible and everyone is attentive an personable. Most importantly my Ma loves this place and thats usually a good sign! My new favorite breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent value for your $.
The brunch tapas concept is great order 3 of them for 2 people and you re full. Try the panco french bread sticks-amazing, served with real maple syrup no surcharge! All in all for 25-30$ for 2 you ll find amongst the best brunches in town."}
{"text":"Quaint local cafe with very friendly staff.
Menu is imaginative and food looks tasty.
I appreciate the soft jazz and big band music playing in the background. Very relaxing ambiance."}
{"text":"Le service est très bon, bien qu'il faille éviter les heures de brunch du week-end. La deco aussi est très sympa, surtout le comptoir fait en bois recycle, et tuyau de cuivre. Cependant la bouffe nest vraiment pas a la hauteur, jy suis allee 3 fois, me disant que c'était peut être moi qui ne savait pas choisir...mais en fin de compte, c'est juste leur bouffe! La salade est trop mouillée, le grilled cheese quon ma servi était complètement effrite, et leur chocolat chaud trop trop sucre. Bref, c'est clair que je ny retournerai plus! Dommage jaime les resto de quartiers!"}
{"text":"Greatest place in Verdun for a nice brunch! Today was the third time I've come to this wonderful cozy place. 

Service is always friendly... so you will always have a pleasent time. 

Now to the fun part... about the food. I just simply can't get enough of two things from their menu. 

First... their eggs benedicts with smoked salmon are so flavourfull and fresh that you MUST try them., and second... they have an AMAZING ... Sweet bacon that goes perfectly with the eggs. 

So what I do everytime is that me and my girlfriend always order the eggs and try another different plate from the menu. Today was the toast sandwich with bluberry jam and mascarpone. VERY GOOD!

Guys... don't miss out on this place!"}
{"text":"Food was delish HOWEVER my table was asked to hurry up andpay and leave because they need the table. A couple of us were still eating! Not cool!!! Owner was super friendly."}
{"text":"As promised by other Yelpers, this brunch spot was wonderful! We had reservations so there was no wait, but be forewarned: Ma douce moutié was PACKED at 10:00 am on a Sunday, attesting to the restaurant's popularity and yumminess! I was heading for the gym right after, so I kept it light with old favourites: two eggs over with toast and jam and really excellent coffee. My friend, on the other hand, had the works! She also had eggs but added a scone with extra raspberry jam, which she ooh-ed and ahh-ed over. The place itself is SUPER friendly; the gentleman who welcomed us was amazingly upbeat and polite, even when every table was taken and the staff was running themselves ragged. Great food, great wait-staff, pleasant and comfortable decor. The only con was one of the waitresses who helped out with coffee refills and water; she wouldn't have smiled if her life depended on it. I chalked it up to her experiencing something personally negative however, and not any animosity toward the clients or outright rudeness on her part. DO try out MDM and DO have the homemade jam!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Although I hate waiting to get seated at restaurants, this place deserves it. We stumbled upon Ma Douce Moitie a few weeks ago and have been back again about a week or so after. 

I love places where you can tell that the chef has put an effort to stand out or be creative, and this restaurant gets 5 stars for that. They have a varied menu including a tapas style one and everything I've had has been great.

The scones are to die for, the farmer's skillet is great and not too heavy, the sweet and salty lemon and egg fried things (sounds weird but so good) are great, the candied bacon is good even for someone like me who can't stand bacon, and the list goes on. The only complaint from my friends about their food when we came was that the eggs benedict was disappointing. However, if you come to a restaurant like this, I urge you to try something new and possibly weird because that's where the fun starts!

The second time we came, the owner came out to check on us and our food which I thought was very nice. Will be back for sure!

Ps. If you're coming for weekend brunch, try to pop in around 11:30.. The line starts at 12!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!!! The menu is incredible and the owners are fantastic people. Everything about this place is perfect, including the fact that they offer both soy and almond milk for lactose intolerant people! Huzzah! 

The food is seriously epic, though. I mean, panko deep fried french toast sticks? Candied bacon? Homemade scones that melt in your mouth? And the potatoes with bacon.. Ermagerdz! Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place for breakfast. The owner, Debra came out to say hello to us! The food was delicious and inspired by dishes from where she has travelled. We had: 
* Chocolate Scones 
* Panco French Breadsticks 
* Farmer's Skillet (I think) 

Everything was insanely delicious. Amazing staff, environment and pricing! We hope to visit when we come down to Montreal again."}
{"text":"Went there with friends & had the two egg skillet. Great service, selection & prices. The food was excellent and the price inexpensive."}
{"text":"Had a very nice breakfast here at the end of  our trip to Montreal. The breakfast sandwiches were great and it had a relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not as good as it use to be... I miss the original format of serving tapas with a wide selection of teas as well as her homemade baked goods."}
{"text":"My ultimate favorite breakfast/brunch place!! of all time...why? The service is so attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is very relaxed and they even have a toy/game shelf section provided for you! Sometimes they play Charlie Chaplin silent movies and also very chill old style music. So recommendations! Their scones are absolutely delicious. Flaky, and soft inside texture. I like to order a plain scone and a sausage which they have daily different choices each day. Ask the waiter for those choices! Also the meat platter for 2 which is 14 dollars is really great too. OR anything on their menu really...can't go wrong. For example breakfast burrito, grilled cheese things...etc 

Great spot in the Verdun area...im talking like breakfast/brunch gem! Really worth visiting if you are on Wellington street!"}
{"text":"J'adore cet endroit! Et c'est tout près de chez moi, alors je suis comblée!
Déjeuners originaux, ambiance amicale et service personnalisé pour les enfants, que demander de plus!
Il n'y a pas de menu pour enfants, mais il y a tellement de choix dans les extras que ce n'est pas un problème. De toute façon, les miens choisissent toujours le pain doré panko. Et c'est le papa qui fini l'assiette ;) Ah oui, très important, c'est servi avec du vrai sirop d'érable, et sans extra.
Le menu est original, ce que j'adore, mais il y a toujours moyen de combler les appétits plus traditionnel.
Il y a un petit coin jeu aussi, mais je préfère que mes enfants restent à table pendant le repas, alors nous ne l'avons pas testé.
Le week-end il faut arriver tôt, et c'est parfois un peu long avant d'être placé (dans le genre la table est dispo, mais la serveuse est trop occupée avec les autres clients pour la nettoyer, ce qui n'est pas une mauvaise chose)."}
{"text":"Had a breakfast sandwich, very simple so it wouldn't be fair to judge right away, but still, it was rather tasty. They have smoothies and milkshakes for you to order.  The décor is quite warm and inviting.   I thought it was a nice place to go for the morning and just sit and relax with friends there. I would consider going back for another meal."}
{"text":"I love their ever changing menu, and their relaxed atmosphere. The food is always huge portioned. You can taste the passion that the chefs have for their creations."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! Panko fried French toast, chai French toast, florentine egg benedict, homemade scones..."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, excellent menu that delivers. I only came here for breakfast but I imagine this place just improves as the day goes on."}
{"text":"Having taken over the space from Le Victoria, Ma Douce Moitie has done a lovely job both with the more open decor, the delightful menu, good service and good quality affordable food. The originality of the brunch tapas concept is quite perfect for sitting and taking your time with a friend or two. The buttermilk scones with their own homemade jams called to me as did the Bubble and Squeak. 
Firstly, the jam; oh...my...goodness. This is the best raspberry jam I believe I have ever had. Deep garnet red and tangy and yet creamy; it was THE ideal accompaniment to the fluffy scone. 
Secondly, the Bubble and Squeak was a total delight and surprise. A perfect over easy egg atop an excellent mix of root veggies and herbs with a side of sour cream. Just right. I will be back for this.
My companion had one of their interesting and unique menu of grilled cheese sandwiches served with home fries. Couldn't resist trying some of the fries and they were well seasoned and well cooked. The sandwich portion looked enormous and the bread excellent and made across the street. I will be back to try these too.
The service was great and the owner, Deborah, makes a point of greeting people and knowing her customers. Look for the busiest woman in the place with the biggest smile. Can't wait to get back there."}
{"text":"Perfect brunchin! Perfect munchin!

The service was fabulous, our waitress was fantastic every step of the way. Attentive, thoughtful, never let my coffee empty, two thumbs wayyyy up for her!

The place fills up around noon. So being that we showed up at around 11ish (on an icy Sunday morning) we had enough time to enjoy our breakfast in relaxation before it started filling up and we decided to vacate our table for the now constant entry of patrons. 

It's moderately sized but I can see how reservations would be needed at prime times to secure yourself a spot. 

Loved the à-la-carte concept to this menu! We pretty much chose the usual fixins of a regular brekkie anyways but everything was cooked to perfection, well presented and reasonably priced. They did mess up on my bacon (despite asking for it soft it arrived quite crispy), but our waitress got me a new plate of bacon that was perfect to my liking lickity split so extra stars for that 'cuz she even came to make sure the bacon was right this time. So sweet! The potatoes are really something but I wish I woulda just stole a couple from my friend instead of ordering my own 'cuz it was a huge portion! The bread was from Premier Moisson, fresh from this morning and was sooooooooo incredible and appreciated...also huge, so our waitress was kind enough to let me know it's possible to order 1 slice instead of 2 (which I will definitely do next time). 

Apparently they've been open for 3 years now but it seemed as though they're still new just 'cuz of the lack of reviews on Yelp and the very worn loose leaf printed pages of the menu that are given to u in a pile lol. This place deserves wayyyy more hype! (Which I say reluctantly 'cuz I'd rather have it all to myself lol). 

I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an awesome brunch!! 10 stars, not just 5! Tell your friends and family...or don't...and then I can keep it all to myself bwahahhahaha!"}
{"text":"Une petite découverte dans Verdun qui semble en pleine expansion culinaire!
Bien situé sur la rue Wellington, nous avons attendu un peu moins d'une demi heure avant d'avoir une table ce qui est raisonnable pour un brunch le samedi midi. 
Les propositions à la carte sont assez classiques, même si il est possible d'ajouter des compléments (patates rôties, ufs, bacon par exemple). On choisi le Monte Cristo gaufres et les légumes rôtis sur polenta, avec en plus un smoothie (plusieurs choix de lait) et un scones. 
Le Monte Cristo était bon et bien garni. La tout est relevé par la confiture de framboise qui donne une touche sucrée et originale faisant la différence. Le plat de légumes rôtis avec la polenta est décevant. Bien que ce soit bon, il manque un petit quelque chose dans l'assaisonnement qui rendrait le tout plus agréable. 
Le scones est un pur régal, notamment accompagné de la confiture de bleuet maison : DÉLICIEUSE. Le smoothie était aussi très bon.
Un bon rapport qualité-prix et un service sympathique."}
{"text":"Tapas au petit-déjeuner, un concept original et délicieux! Vous pouvez y trouver scones, assiettes de viandes à partager, doigts à tremper, ufs, etc. Pourquoi ne pas partager quelques plats, c'est d'autant plus agréable et l'on goûte à plus de choses. Il faut essayer la saucisse aux olives noires, simplement divines.   Le tout fait sur place ou par des artisans. 

Ma douce moitié est un endroit super accueillant pour les enfants. Nous étions avec un jeune enfant, on lui a prêté un verre et une assiette en forme de chien. Les employés étaient contents et amicaux avec tous les enfants dans le restaurant. Il a aussi des jeux pour enfant et des jeux de société pour les plus grands.

Le décor, mi-rétro, mi-moderne, sans prétention. 

C'est un nouveau \" must \" du déjeuner!"}
{"text":"Endroit calme et décontracté.
Le service était courtois et le serveur souriait.  La nourriture était bonne, mais je ne peux pas dire que j'ai été surpris.  La présentation des mets est divertissante, on est loin du traditionnel oeuf/bacon.  Je dois cependant souligner que le rapport qualité/prix est plus que raisonnable et j'inclus le pourboire.  Bref, un resto charmant à quelques pas de chez moi, où, il n'est pas gênant d'inviter un ami pour déjeuner."}
{"text":"I don't see how this place received nice reviews. I came because of them and I feel cheated. The service is VERY slow, not nearly as amicable as people described. We ordered the burrito, the artisan apple cheddar sausage, and the polenta covered in veggies. In theory, this all sounded very good. But in truth, everything was under seasoned, almost tasted like hospital food. I'm not saying it because I was looking for something spicy, not at all. The food was basically tasteless. The best thing on my dish was the sausage and the cheese inside it was all charred. 
We waited more than the usual for service and the dishes to come. When the food arrived, the waitress left and we didn't even have forks and knives. The couple next to us also asked us for our table's salt.
As dessert we shared the crunchy pain doré sticks with honey butter. Again, tasteless. And somehow it left a sticky feeling inside my mouth. I do not recommend this place, in fact I don't want to ever come back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we were very disappointed! While the decor, the ambience and the menu all looked great the food left a lot to be desired. 

High points: the eggs were well cooked, the scone was delicious and the bacon on the meat platter was outstanding!

Low points: the veggie patty in the bubble and squeak was undercooked, chunky, under seasoned and the patty was way too thick. The potato hash was undercooked and pretty bland. The breakfast sandwich was only ok. 

Service was friendly, and fast."}
{"text":"Visited for a late breakfast while on vacation today.  Our host had made the recommendation and had emphasized that it was extremely kid friendly. 

Everything, and I mean everything, was amazing from the time we walked into the door.  Our waiter was extremely attentive.  Our kids were given IKEA bowls with cut up bananas and cups of water.  We were directed to a \"play corner\" for the kids stocked with toys.

And the food.  Oh gosh, the food.  Enormous portions, and so so so delicious!!!  There is love coming out of that kitchen!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good & the place looked really nice! The service was slow though? We never got our glass of water and never had the opportunity to ask for it once the food was the table. But otherwise, good food, good coffee, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Le décor de cet endroit est une réussite. L'accueil est vraiment bon. Les serveurs sont attentionnés et efficaces... ils passent en permanence vous remplir l'eau ou le cafe. La bouffe est excellente, fraîche... un vrai régal. Je recommande cet endroit qui est unique dans ce quartier."}
{"text":"Pour un bruch planifié en famille avec un bébé de 15 mois, on lit les avis et on se décide pour cet endroit. L'accueil des enfants est en effet impeccable : une banane dans une super assiette chien on the house.
Pour les adultes, il y en a plein l'assiette ! On ressort le ventre bien plein.
Les serveuses sont adorables.
Pourquoi pas 5 étoiles ? Ben la nourriture est bonne mais pas extra. Pas de révolution des papilles en vue."}
{"text":"So happy I came here! There are many options to choose from, from sweet to salty, to satisfy everyone. I had the sweet and salty hushpuppies and my friend had the cannoli crepe with the candied bacon. Everything was excellent! The service was as good as the food: friendly, efficient and welcoming. I will definitely come back as there are many other things I want to try.

The only negative thing I have to say is that there's no air conditioning, so it gets pretty hot during the summer heat."}
{"text":"Restaurant très artistique situé sur la rue Wellington dans Verdun.
Très bon brunch et bon service.
Mais petite place donc un peu d'attente la fin de semaine.
Prix très raisonnable."}
