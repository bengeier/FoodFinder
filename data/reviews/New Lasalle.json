{"text":"We were visiting family in LaSalle and a friend recommended we try Restaurant Nouveau LaSalle for pizza. We were surprised because the menu was big and had a wide variety of choices, not just pizza. Having lived in Montreal and now living in California, we were pleased to see that the 3 of us could select our favorites.  One chose pizza, one chose a salad and I had the smoked meat sandwich. All were nicely plated as the photos will show, the food was fresh and the combos which included soup were delicious. Prices were very fair, as the combos included soup, coffee and a small dessert. You won't walk out hungry.  Service was pleasant, the seating was comfortable, the parking was easy. We are very fussy, so we held back on a five star rating only because it was our first time there and we reserve our five stars for places that are consistently great. Most customers should find it to be a five star choice in this category. Casual dining, great food, very fair prices."}
{"text":"I've known these guys for a while. They used to have two locations, one for eating in and take out and deliveries. The second place was next door to a bar which soon closed, so the owner bought that spot and merged the two.  Now you can enjoy all their delicious subs, pizzas or whatever of their menu items strike your fancy and either dine in or take out.  They offer ice cream and gelato, too. With names similar to those on the menu of a certain franchise, you can enjoy the hot summer."}
{"text":"Tried these guys last night, delivery... SOOOO IMPRESSED!!!  Delivery time: 19 minutes from the time they picked up the phone to take my order!!!!!!! It does NOT get faster than that my friends...unless of course you food arrives uncooked, which was not the case. Cooked beautifully.   Ordered the gyro pita platter and 2 hotdogs (20.50$ tax incl). Gyro meat: nice and thick and tasty. Tzatziki  sauce: very good (not the best ever but really really very good). Pita: warm and fresh what more could you ask for? Rice: excellent, very flavourful, a bit on the salty side but that's ok for me. Salad: nice variety, fresh, nice light sweet creamy dressing. Greek potatoes: not Greek enough for my liking but cooked to crispy yet fluffy perfection. Yes even the hotdogs were dammm tasty and despite looking like they were cheap on the toppings, it was the perfect amount.  From the photos on the menu they may even have that perfect smoked meat I've been searching for so i'm very much looking forward to ordering again! (And will definitely take photos next time)."}
