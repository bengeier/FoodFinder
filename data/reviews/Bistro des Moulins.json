{"text":"This was one of those \"oh yeaaah, that's why I use Yelp\" moments. We found ourselves out in what is basically the suburban middle o' nowhere of North Montreal, wandering along an extensive network of bike/pedestrian paths and really old buildings, when hunger and thirst struck. Oh no! What to do!!! Yelp it, that's what. An hour later we were enjoying mussels and wine in the loveliest of settings, a historical site, surrounded by rushing water.  The food was great, the service was very so-so, but the ambiance made up for any shortcomings.   Dining is strictly terrace, I'm not sure what is inside the actual building though my instinct tells me that it is museum-ish...  I would recommend this as the reward for a nice long randonnée, either on foot or on vélo."}

{"text":"Tucked in a heritage building with its terrace perched on a rushing set of streams within the Riviere des Prairies, this Bistro is a mellow, modern gem that remembers 19th century Montreal. Veggies here are market fresh, steaks are grilled on an outdoor bbq, and the menu is creative and delicious: we loved the mint pea soup and the papardelle with panchetta, wild mushrooms and almonds. About a 15 minute drive north of the Plateau, this bistro is off the beaten path for some Montrealers but the food in addition to the surrounding forest, riverfront, and architecture make it well worth the trip. Bonus: walk across the bridge to the island bird sanctuary at sunset, watch the woods for fireflies."}
