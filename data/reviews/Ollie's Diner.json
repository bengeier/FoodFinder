{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the extensive menu options. From the four egg omelette's scrambled fresh, and not made from bagged eggs, as some restraunts have gone to using.  To the hand pounded, hand breaded pork tenderloin cooked fresh per order. The servers were friendly and prompt, and brought our food still steaming from the kitchen. Ollies is not something you would expect, from a small diner. And I can't forget the coffee, it was hot and exceptional, and I never seemed to have an empty cup....I will definitely come back again and again.."}
{"text":"Good diner fare. Big omelettes with lots of filling. This is one of those fair diners with good food at good prices. Not our favorite place. Not the BEST diner EVER. However good breakfast, good grilled tilapia."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast,  lunch or dinner. Great people,  owners and employees. Treats you like family.   Nice locally owned diner.  Have never been disappointed"}
{"text":"I go to restaurants for their food, and Ollie's has tasty food. That said, the service was just great. Friendly friendly waitress, quick with drinks and check. Food took a bit, but that's gonna happen when your food is fresh made. Great casual spot for American food."}
{"text":"As the prior reviewer states I too drove by this place a million times. My husband and I love breakfast and are always seeking the ultimate omelet . We both ordered (of course) an omelet. Mine was chorizo, cheese and green chilies and my husband's was cheese and mushroom. I must say the food was piping hot, which is always a plus for me, I like my food hot! The omelet was pretty darn good, and the hashbrowns were nice and crisp. Not my ultimate omelet but I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I tell first what I like about this place, the old driving out of town feeling, when you look outside it looks like you are in a small town passing through.  The food was good, the service was okay, the ladies are a bit older, so smiling is not part of their service.  The part that I dont like is that the restaurant is way too old fashion, they don't have splenda in this time and age...all restaurant should have some.  Anyway, I wouldn't go out of my way, but if that's all I can find because is really close home...then it will do."}
{"text":"We have been going here for about 3 yrs food is always great I have had the country bowel hot roast beef meal hot turkey meal and the mushroom and Swiss burger and a couple of there omelets . My hubby gets the country bowel western bowel a burger a patty melt omelets pancakes eggs etc our son gets eggs burgers or hot wings our daughter gets country bowel omelets French toast eggs pancakes etc its always great food and the .We are there 1-3 times a week fairly priced and you get a lot of food for the money . Staff is friendly and check on you and make sure you have everything you need . I would recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"The folks at Ollie's Diner are wonderful. They are friendly without being in your face! I come here to write and grade papers. The food is super; love the many veg-friendly offerings. Just GO! Shop local!"}
{"text":"Coming from the food industry myself, I must say that this place is pretty awesome! Came out here from CA to celebrate Father's Day and decided to bring dad here for breakfast.  The food comes in big portion for the money. I ordered the fried chicken and waffle which had really good flavors.  The waffle had the perfect texture.  Service is fast and friendly considering on a busy morning. After reading all the Yelps review, I believe that it is under rated. It seems like most of the reviews was from the previous owner when it was still Ollie's Omelette House. People ought to give this place a try and see for themselves. I'll be back and will try their other items on the menu."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Ollie's Diner, you are missing out on not only exceptional home cooked food, but amazing hospitality as well! Sam, the owner, is very nice and makes you feel right at home. Johnathon, our waiter, took  great care of us and was very attentive to detail. I had the chicken fried steak, and it was the best I'd ever had, and very well priced! We are going to become regulars here now, and I would recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Driven by this place several times and finally decided to stop in for breakfast and give it a try. We arrived around 10:15am and were seated right away which is the only positive thing I can say. The restaurant was busy, however, there were some empty tables so it's not as though they were overly busy. The waitress took our order and 45 minutes later, we were still waiting for our food. We noticed that a man and woman that came in AFTER we did, were already eating their food. We also noticed the table right across from us had not received their food and they had arrived before we did. We called the waitress over to ask about our order and was told she was keeping a watch for it and she explained the delay was due to a very large table in the restaurant, however, those people had already been served and were eating. She did not apologize for the delay and didn't seem to know when our order might be coming out. Needless to say, we left the restaurant and will not return."}
{"text":"My lady and I went to Ollie's a couple of weeks ago. She ordered fried chicken and waffles. When she bit into the chicken it was raw around the bone. Instead of risking having them remake the chicken she ordered sausage links, again undercooked. The waitress did comp the chicken. Only thing good concerning our dining experience was the service."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and we're very happy with the food and the service is wonderful!!!  We are planning to go to breakfast with friends soon - their menu looks amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurants quality of food, friendly staff, and low prices! Can't go wrong with ollies but the only downfall to this amazing restaurant is the wait time for food, my good it shouldn't take 40 minutes for some pancakes and scrambled eggs when the restaurant is half empty! I understand that's why the quality of the food is great because they have chefs that take they're time but 40 minutes for scrambled eggs and a Minnie Mouse pancake is ridiculous! Only way I'll come in is before 7am so I can have my food out when I finally get a decent appetite..."}
{"text":"Great place to eat for breakfast or lunch!  The steak sandwich was great, was like having a real steak from one of those fancy steak restaurants!  Staff was friendly.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to go here with an ex-girlfriend since this was the only cheap decent breakfast place around that wasn't Ihop or Denny's. It's okay, the food is mediocre but its cheap so what do you expect? I like the fact that it's small and definitely diner like so it makes you feel warm and cozy. I'd much rather prefer this place over a denny's or a cheap chain restaurant. But if I was looking for a great breakfast place Ollies would NOT be my 1st choice."}
{"text":"ehhh...barely edible. Went for breakfast on a Sunday morning with a party of 5, typically busy. Bad layout of restaurant...lots of booths around the perimeter and tables squished in the middle. I had 2 eggs, 2 sausage patties and 2 biscuits & gravy. Everything but the sausage was cold, the biscuits weren't homemade and the gravy tastes like raw flour. Mother-In Law's food was also cold and one order of \"toast\" came out as bread- not toasted at all. There was no point in sending it back because no one ever checked back. My husbands food came out steaming hot, needs better timing in the kitchen. We won't be back..."}
{"text":"drive bye here all the time Finley made it in inside its east meets west with the American and Asian decor but nothing Asian on the menu weird but I had the omelet and waffle the omelet was OK I did like that it was cook hard so it wasn't watery the waffle was grate crispy and fluffy what a waffle should be wife had Benedict she like it she said  now for the service that were it went down hill me we never got our drink refilled  it was what do you want hares the food and check bye  the biggest thing for me was she keep on playing with her hair YUCK and the wait   why does it that almost 30 min to get food after you order when it wasn't that busy maybe 10 tables I'll go back for that waffle it was tasty"}
{"text":"This review is based largely on the biscuits and gravy. I'm from Nebraska where B-n-G is a food group. It's hard to find it this good. We all know the common boxed stuff and this isn't it. Honestly, I'll be driving back across town to have this again. Add to it the eggs were cooked perfect over medium, and the staff were super friendly!  I learned about couponing from one of them!!!  Win win win. I'll be back! Don't ever change that gravy!"}
{"text":"A month ago I tried Ollies for the first time because my customers said their homefries were the best. So I ordered my breakfast and waited maybe 20 minutes which is a little long for breakfast but being a server myself I was patient. The food was good but my eyes were stinging from the smoke and fumes from the kitchen and was told it's normally not like that. So I went back this morning and will never go back again. The waitress took our order and never checked back or said anything 45 minutes later just totally ignored us. We sat in the back of the restaurant and yes my eyes were stinging and watering as well as another woman who had to step outside for fresh air. I was very disappointed especially since I work at a restaurant as well. Not sure how they keep customers but they lost a couple of good tipping customers today. Oh and btw we were tired of waiting and being ignored and left before our food came out I'm sorry but eggs and toast don't take 45 minutes. Skip Ollies and go to Mcds like we did."}
{"text":"Went in Sat. night for early 5:30pm dinner. Wanted diner food. Seated in a nice comfy clean booth. Great server...dealing with all the tables & one server he did a great job:) nice dinner salad, id skip the soup, done right baked potato & shrimp basket for $8.99! Wow a lot of food. Hubby had club sandwich w/ ff..also done right. Large portions, fresh meal & better than Denny, IHOP etc. let's support small businesses:) 5 stars is overall a good deal for food, great service & clean surroundings. Give them a try."}
{"text":"i made my own omlette, i had turkey, spinach, avacado and peppers it was really good and the service is good as well"}
{"text":"I love this place and went quite often when we first moved here. The last few times we went our favorite waitresses are missing. Seems to be a lot of new ones....just not the same feel now. The food is good but loved the friendly family feel of the old waitresses."}
{"text":"Love it here. I order the club sandwich all the time. Inside the place is very home like and clean. My only complaint is the men's restroom has this weird soap dispenser that is outdated and not sanitary. I'd recommend bringing hand sanitizer before coming here so you don't have to use their soap dispenser . And to add to the review, the plate of food they give you is always big enough for two people."}
{"text":"I probably drove by this place a thousand times, and didn't give it a second thought. Housed in a muddy yellow, squat brick building, with a dingy awning, I didn't have much hope for Ollie's.   But Sunday morning, the pantry was empty, we were out of coffee (NOOOOOOO!!!), and needed to calorie-load for a busy day of home improvement.   The area IHOPs and Waffle Houses, are always just  meh at best. The dining experiences there usually involve lots of crying babies, spotty service, and sticky tables. Black Bear Diner just had a ridiculous number of cars in the parking lot, and we were not up for a long wait. Plus their biscuits are dry and crumbly.  That's when Ollie's popped into our minds.   When we arrived, there was a decent number or cars in the parking lot, but not too many. The interior betrays the dull exterior. It is bright, and minimally decorated with cutesy country accents, and a couple of portable AC units. We were seated within a minute by a friendly hostess.  Our server, a no-nonsense kind of lady, with probably many years of front of the house experience, came by shortly thereafter. She offered a  a quick \"good morning,\" and came back in a hurry with a carafe of surprisingly good coffee. As she went around the room, doting on the regulars, we looked over the menu.  No surprises there. The first 80-something selections are omelets. I'm sorry to say, I'm not a big fan of omelets. So I chose the egg and cheese breakfast burritos and some home fries. My dining companion chose the steak and eggs with hash browns.  Our order was to our table in record time. The server left before we could ask for any condiments, but like a true veteran, she was back in a few seconds, laden with everything we could possibly need.  First impressions -- presentation was minimal. After all, it is just breakfast, so I don't really care about all that anyway. The burrito was piping hot, so I snacked on the home fries for a while. Whoa! They were good! Crispy and seasoned on the outside, fluffy on the inside -- like curly fries, but in dice form.  When I could finally pick up the burrito, I found it stuffed with light, fluffy eggs and cheddar cheese. The cheese was kind of cheapie and took a while to melt, but tasted OK. The salsa served with it was not bad.  My companion's verdict on the steak and eggs was that it was good, but not worth $8.99. I believe our total bill was about $21.  All in all, this may be our new \"go-to\" restaurant for breakfast, when we wake up unprepared and starving."}
{"text":"With all due respect, fellow Yelpers, I don't know why you like this place. The food is awful and made with cheap, low-quality ingredients that add up to a mediocre meal.   I ordered No. 18, the bacon, mushroom, tomato and cheese omelet. My dining companions ordered No. 45 and orange juice, and the waffle special (waffle, egg and sausage).   No. 18 was an overcooked, rubbery mess with a couple of mushroom slices, a teaspoon of diced tomatoes and no cheese that I could find. There *was* plenty of bacon. The omelet was supposed to be made with four large eggs--definitely not!    The omelet came with toast and hash browns. The hash browns are instant (those of you who have worked in food service know how the dried potatoes are dumped into a bucket of water and allowed to soak overnight). No amount of salsa can make them taste like real potatoes.   I ordered whole wheat toast. The toast was made from cheap, stale bread that was a vaguely brown color with no discernable whole grains, and coated with butter-flavored oil.   I asked for salsa. It was bottled, not made at the restaurant, and I was charged 50 cents for about a tablespoon of the stuff. Almost every breakfast place has its delicious house-made salsa, but not Ollie's.   My dining companions' breakfasts were about the same: overcooked, everything made from instant mixes and the cheapest ingredients possible. The sausage that came with the waffle special was disgusting--the cheap kind with more mystery-meat filler (hope it was soy, but who knows?) than meat and a gross, spongy texture.  The OJ my dining companion ordered never arrived.   Service: Warm, friendly greeting at the door, but after that, mediocre (waitress forgot stuff, and the male owner was downright surely when I asked for more salsa to drown the hash browns).   Ambiance: Extremely noisy. Lots of screaming kids and their parents (who don't behave much better than their kids).   Coffee: Mediocre. But in Ollie's defense, I found this to be the case all over Arizona. Apparently, folks in Arizona prefer the taste of Folgers and its bland ilk, because even the hipster breakfast place we went to served it this way. If you want a tasty cup of dark roast, you'll have to go to Starbucks.    Bottom line: for the price, about $12 per person, you can do MUCH better. Pass on Ollie's."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have amazing breakfast potatoes! The price is a steal! Always so friendly and fast. Great place to bring my kids as Im trying to teach them to act appropriate in public."}
{"text":"Ollie's Omelette House is a small little diner that is never really busy but never empty either. It reminds me of a small town restaurant where the locals eat at and outside people passing by wouldn't look twice at. The food is good, the price is great. Its quiet and we dont come here with the kids out of respect for other guests eating. Compared to other places where you can get a decent meal for $4.99 I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Awesome waffles with pecans it was delicious! Blanca my waitress great service always wonderful!"}
{"text":"Eh. Took a long time to get our food and I am very patient. We almost walked out and went somewhere else as we were really hungry. Unimpressed with the place but the server was very nice."}
{"text":"Love this place, been coming here for years. Great omelets, great salads, great club sandwiches and also great French toast! Nice atmosphere, friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"Great service first time and back today ...Food was good .... Good little local spot in Glendale .."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed, I had the Pastrami sandwich and half of the Pastrami was so full of fat and gristle that I ended up with a half sandwich and then I order the sweet potato fries since it comes with fries and wasn't told it was extra. I get to the register the lady asked how it was and I told her about the fat and gristle and she was  oh that must of been a the cut. (says nothing else just checks me out) well this tells me if you have a complaint just don't go back because they don't care!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast food without a crowd or a wait, check.  Large tasty omelets, check.  Hip swanky atmosphere or trendy ingredients, uh, no.  It's pretty basic breakfast fare here with hearty portions and friendly service.  If you want \"pretty on the plate\", I think you're going to have to leave Glendale anyhow.  The coffee was a little burned and I thought the hash browns were sub-par.  However, my brother loved his gigantic Italian omlette (as big as his head - and trust me...that's big.)  If you want suburban-hell-breakfast-for-the-masses, this place is as good as an IHOP and you're giving your money (and less of it) to a local business - and for that I ought to give it more stars."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 1 stars because of the fresh omelettes they serve. Other than that...service sucks! You will be waiting for a looooong time before they take your drink order....then another loooong time before they take your food order. If you order coffe...it will also be a loooong wait for a refill. Don't know if they are short in staff or if they simply don't care."}
{"text":"The restaurant gave my pickup order to the wrong person. We walked in at the same time and I was there when she gave the order back. They tried to give the order to me after she returned it. How gross to know that they would give me an order that was given to the wrong person and returned. What I asked for them to cook me a fresh one, the waitresses started acting funny and had an attitude. They waited three minutes replated it and then try to give it to me again. Please do not eat at this restaurant it is not safe and the manager cooks in flip-flops!! I will be reporting them to the Board of Health. Think of all the cross contamination when they try to to give me food that was returned as if it was nothing!!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times for their breakfast. I've always been happy with my choices (omelets, pancakes, and French toast). The prices are really fair and the food comes out in a reasonable amount of time. I only gave it 4 stars because the service is either excellent (which is usually the case) but there have been a few occasions where we haven't seen our waiter except to get drinks, to drop off food, and to drop off the check. This is the exception though not the norm. It doesn't stop us from going back again."}
{"text":"Closed Down! Don't waste your time it's closed. Poor management y food was not good at all prior to its closing. Underwent management change 2-3 times."}
{"text":"Woke up with a desire for a diner breakfast.  Grabbed the parents and went to Ollie's.  First, like all breakfast joints, get there early.  We arrived shortly after they opened and by the time we left, the parking lot was packed.  Luckily they do not seat allot, and the single waitress (Cali) was able to keep up with us all.  The breakfast choices were great, but i ALWAYS get a classic two egg breakfast.  If a place messes this up then they have issues.  Ollie's did not mess this up.  The grilled english muffin was perfect, the bacon crisp, the hash browns just enough bite to make you want to keep eating them.  Mom got the french toast.  Delicious.  The prices are reasonable and the place is friendly.  We WILL be going back."}
{"text":"Returned again and once again the food was not very good. This is the second time the food has not been very good at all restroom smell bad like sewage. The service was good but the service was good. That's all not sure if I'll be back"}
{"text":"I went here with my husband, because it was one of the closest breakfast joints that showed up on my cell's navigation. :o) It seemed ok from the outside. When you get in, you'll notice there's a really low ceiling, so I felt a little cramped right off the bat. Anyway, we were seated right away, which was nice on a Sunday morning. It was busy inside, but not packed by any means. The decor was okay, but nothing special as well. The blinds were vinyl white pull downs that looked like a movie projector screen when the sun was shining thru it, so that was amusing. There were a lot of options on the menu, including a lunch/brunch menu. They had 40+ omelette combos to choose from (including an egg beaters substitute option).   I decided to get the omelette w/ guacamole, sour cream, cheese served w/ hash browns and toast (they offered a pancake instead of toast, fyi). My husband got a similar omelette w/ avocado (#29) and pancake instead. It took a while to order, b/c we asked for 1 mins, we got 6 mins to decide. :o(  When the food came, the presentation didn't wow us at all and the pancake that my husband got  was literally stuck to the plate...what the....??! But he said it tasted okay, as he gave me this funny look. So then,I started eating my food and it seemed decent, but not the best I had.  I don't know if I would eat here again, but we'll see if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Server was very friendly. The food was alright from what I ordered. Their pancakes look pretty good though. My stomach felt a little strange after eating there"}
{"text":"Great food. Good atmosphere. Solid coffee. Only reason it was 5 stars was service was a bit lack luster"}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Great prices! And amazing portions!! Our server was sweet and orderly. She said there was only one cook but our food came out at a really decent time.!! All around completely pleased! We ordered the fried zucchini as an app! And mmmm super tasty! Fried fish was delicious and my hubby got steak and shrimp! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The servers were friendly and the price is cheaper than expected! I will come again! If u stop by here during your lunch break from you, u can tell them and they will try their best to get u out before u are late to class"}
{"text":"Disgusting.  Never again.  Soup was canned.  Thighs were itty bitty.  The four onion rings I got were all grease.  The bun for the cheese steak was stale and there was next to nothing inside."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and prices are better then IHOP or Denny's . breakfast and lunch are delicious, waitresses are friendly , good place to bring the family"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Sunday morning. So disappointed. It took about a hour to get the food. Should eggs and pancakes really take this long to cook? Food wasn't very good. Had no flavor. No one came to check on us. Had to ask two times for water refills. Then when we went to pay they tried to overcharge us. Luckily I was watching the register. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast last Saturday about 7:30.  I got a bit worried as I was the only customer in the place.  This must be normal because the place started filling up and the hostess and busboy started at 8:00.  Service was efficient and friendly. The restaurant was clean and the tables and seating were in good shape.  Keeping in theme with the name of omelet house, there is an entire page of omelets.  Really a bunch of different add ins listed as separate omelets.  I ordered mine with ham, onions, bell pepper and cheese.  It came out ok, nothing wrong with it but sort of flavorless.  The hash browns were fully cooked and brown on top.  Some folks may not like they were a bit greasy but that gave them flavor.    Solid local breakfast/lunch place with reasonable pricing.  But nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"I've lived behind this restaurant for 4 years and just visited last weekend...I'm hooked! The outside made it seem drab to me but I gave it a chance and was not disappointed.  The portions are awesome relative to the price, you get a great deal and everything was delicious.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've seen several of the bad reviews and honestly never had anything bad to say about the place except on Sunday morning after church you will wait quite a bit for food.   Everything I've eaten here has been fantastic, the portions are YUUUUUUGE and the price is very tiny. Try the western bowl add sour cream and avocado Mmmm!!!  I've lived around the corner from this spot for years and have seen it morph into one thing or another. Trust your gut and stop, the complaint department yells loudly, but their service and food will prove it a worthy breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, or for Friday night fish fry. Food is always fresh, portions are generous. We've noticed, however, that sometimes the portions are more generous at breakfast during the week than on Sunday morning.  Love the senior omelet, but today I had the Italian omelet which I immediately cut in half. Breakfast tomorrow!! The Italian sausage was so delicious, added a lot of flavor, and the mozzarella was lovely and meted inside.  We come often, and I'd come again!! Oh, yes, the fish on Friday is some of the best I've ever had. Light, crispy crust, not greasy. Sweet fish, again generous pieces. I had to learn that two pieces is more than enough for me!"}
{"text":"I have gone here for about 3 or 4 years now and have noticed the food has gotten a little bland. It's got a good atmosphere, pleasant wait staff, and it's pretty clean. The food has become average and on the bland side, but for a quick bite to eat out running errands its good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Their omelettes are completely out of control. Huge. And the hashbrowns are delicious perfectly cooked.  Nice and crunchy on the top like they should be. The french fries were exceptional. The entire male was phenomenal, I will absolutely go back. And I highly suggest going here"}
{"text":"Nice little friendly place. Went here for Father's Day, it was a little busy but not to bad. Had 6 of us in our party. Found out the do reservations for large parties. For was good. Great prices and high portions. I also won't forget about the great service too.  Highly recommended you try this place you won't regret it. It's a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"well, sometimes \"little hole in the wall\" places are very good and tend to surprise you... but not this place... The service was good and friendly, but the food was horrible. The orange juice tasted very bad, the gravy on the biscuits tasted like flour and water (paper mache) the bacon and mushroon omlet had a bad after taste... skip this place and go to ihop."}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved to this side of town and were very pleased to find this little gem (along with the 2 other restaurants next door).  First off, this is an Omelet place, lot's of omelets on the menu, but some god lunch items as well.  Second it's a neighborhood place, so the decor is in keeping with \"local\".  So to the goofballs commenting on \"Presentation\" of the dishes or \"Ambiance\", get over yourselves.  These are delicious, well made omelets (watch Alton Brown's Good Eats \"egg\" episode for how to make a good \"french\" omelet so you know what you are talking about).  The coffee was excellent and the prices were reasonable.  Everything I expect in a neighborhood joint, and a little more."}
{"text":"Just ordered a simple hamburger with fries. Incredible taste, and appearance!  Very happy with the quality of the food. And the price was very affordable for a made to order meal. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I would give it a zero star if I could. The waitress who greeted us was nice. Once we were seated, we waited a long time for our food. The waitress never asked if we needed anything. Just dropped the food off and kept moving. Finally there was a piece of hair so long and thick that it seemed it was put there purposely. I'm so appalled and upset. I will never visit this establishment again. Totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"Went in today for breakfast at 9:04, ordered our breakfast around 910, 45 minutes later, still no food still not a word from our waitress. A simple stopping by every 10 to 15 minutes to say hey guys may be a few more minutes the kitchens backed up yada yada would have  gone a long way , eventually we just got up and left extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Heck no, this place is awful and I didn't even get to try the food. My family and I went on a Sunday and the place was packed so I was thrilled! A new place with such great food that there was only one table open. Awesome right? Um no. Apparently that was the 'do not serve' table and we didn't see anyone for 10 minutes to take our order. We didn't even get drinks!! Our stupid asses sat there for 45 minutes and our food wasn't there yet. So I talked to the manager and she gave me a story about how a waitress just walked out durning our order but did not offer us anything. Not that I was expecting much but not even a sorry???  I was so ticked off. We ended up walking out. Never. Again."}
{"text":"Unappealing food and restaurant. Bland sauce on spaghetti. Sloppy random sized sausage pieces. Toast soaking in sauce. Service was poor. Not quality food."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this place because the sandwich shop was packed. Reviews sounded like a decent place. The center cut pork chops were okay at best. Dry with no gravy or sauce. The canned mushrooms on top helped but not much. Instant mashed potatoes tasted microwaved. The canned mixed vegetables weren't even Del Monte quality....more like Food King. I might try it again for breakfast, but never again for lunch or dinner. Very disappointing since I live so close by."}
{"text":"Nice, clean, open, and friendly.  Got there at 1 pm, just an hour before closing, and the place was nearly deserted, but they choose to seat us at the table farthest from the front door.  Maybe they had already cleaned the tables upfront getting ready to close in an hour.  Who knows,but they were very friendly about it.  The food was not out of this world, but good.  Not very good, but enjoyable.  The wait, especially when the place was so slow, was too long for the quality of the food. It's nice for a meal, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Came here with my Mom. Greedy only fashioned diner nice spot. It's more My mothers kind of spot! But it was great"}
{"text":"Love the chicken fried here great atmosphere as also  a great central location and the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"Don't call asking anything about modifying your order if you ordered from postmates because I guess they aren't aware that they're listed. I ordered extra fries through the app & called to confirm over the phone to make sure they knew it was seperate from the fries that already come with the meal I ordered. My meal came but they didn't give me my 2nd order of fries yet they charged me for them."}
{"text":"Tucked into the Frys shopping center this little neighborhood diner is a great breakfast spot..   This is one of those places with regular customers and favorite waitresses.. (love places like that!) .. you walk in and it's dark and old, some funny signs and knick knacks scattered around.   The menu has all your basics and there's a long list of omelettes.. I like the traditional so I stick with the American breakfast ($6.20).. 2 eggs, 2 bacon or sausage, potatoes, toast or pancake .. the home fries with the onion and bell pepper (really good).. food arrives quickly.  Lots of available parking, lots of regular customers, friendly waitresses .. what a diner is supposed to be."}
{"text":"Lambaste me later, but I hate eggs with a passion. Can't stand 'em. So why go to an omelette house? Because they serve up a big lunch. I went with the California burger, with cheese and guac. Opting for half fries and half onion rings, I'll say now to GET THE ONION RINGS. They're the delicious beer battered kind, and not that breaded bullshit you get from Burger King.   Anyways, it wasn't half bad. All 1/2 a pound of it, which I had trouble finishing. Couldn't hurt that it was only $6.35, either. What made my experience noteworthy, however, was the service. There were tons of other customers, but staff was so fast I felt like I had my own personal butler at my side.  If it weren't open from 6AM to 2PM, I'd for sure come here more often. I'll be back for the breakfast, and will update then. In the mean time, check this place out! You know I won't steer you in the wrong direction."}
{"text":"Thought this would be some great home style breakfast. The food was honestly really poor i can cook much better at home and thats a bad sign. Id say its about one step BEHIND Dennys  and dennys is as low budget and badic as it gets. They use the cheapest ingredients here and everything taste bland or bad. There is no focus on quality of food nor ingredients used. They clearly just buy the cheapest options available and serve it to you.  I was embarrassed for the owners when I saw that this place never gets cleaned, dusted, or updated. Very old decor with dust all over and it's extremely hot and muggy in here. There was no A/c being used at all when we came in on FATHERS DAY! Very dissatisfied from top to bottom this place was a complete disaster. I can go on and on about the negatives but I'm sure u get the point by now."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a few times and always noticed how busy it was but never had a chance to try it out.    Didn't realize how much of a void there was in my life until I came here. From the second I walked in, the staff was friendly and seated me promptly despite the huge crowd.   When you go to a busy restaurant you know they're busy for a reason and boy was the food DELICIOUS!!! I made my own custom omelet and the portions were very hearty!! The food was so good I licked the plate clean. Almost caught myself trying to lick a random strangers plate too but didn't want to get a restraining order.   When you have a friendly knowledgeable staff mixed with great service and top notch food... you my friend have found yourself at the Ollies!"}
{"text":"Hot breakfast spot, just west of 51stAve on Olive. Be prepared to wait on the weekends, they are busy. Huge portions, great omelette selection and the wait staff really hustles. Coffee is always fresh and great for families or groups. Weekday mornings are the slowest."}
{"text":"This has been our go to breakfast spot since we moved into the neighborhood.  There seems to have been a change in management or ownership maybe.  One thing that hadn't changed was the stellar service of waitress, Ms Blanca.  We returned today sad that she no longer works their or maybe a different schedule.   Without her,  the place has lost a bit of the charm."}
{"text":"Ollies is a great little gem, with great build your own omelettes. The chorizo and cheese is great! When you go, try the home fries! Be prepared for a little wait. It's not too bad, but it's a popular spot."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great people, one of my favorite places to eat. Sometimes they get busy, so if your in a hurry, let them know, they do take care of you."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant, The Service is Outstanding and the waitress Blanca has always been very respectful & I have been eating here for years. I highly recommend Ollie's Diner to ANYONE that wants Great food at a great value for their family as well.  John L."}
{"text":"Ollie's Diner is located right off Olive and 51st Ave, right in the Frys parking lot.  Large restaurant, clean and no wait was seated immediately.  Food; Ordered the Short stake pancakes, with a side of bacon; the pancakes were delicious just like your Dad used to make.  The bacon was crisp and delicious.  My Daughter got the French Toast, that looked amazing and she said tasted very good.  Service; the service was amazing and super outgoing.  The coffee was always topped off before my cup would be empty."}
{"text":"like having dinner at a friend's house...home made. big portions...friendly staff. comfortable environment. we went on a friday night for the fish fry all you can eat. we left stuffed! we were served two pieces of cod perfectly fried with 3 sides. i had a baked potato...perfect. salad was cold, fresh and crispy. the waiter didn't hover but he knew when to drop more fish for us... i am going back next week for the homemade meatloaf and mashed potatoes. i could find anything to complain about. go here with confidence and enjoy."}
{"text":"Terrible quality food for about $7 an omellette. Orange Juice tastes like a bad version of Sunny D. I recommend avoiding."}
{"text":"Gave this 2 stars because the place is nice and fairly clean, and the waitress was very attentive. The food was not so good. I ordered the corned beef hash omelette and kept looking to find any hash in that omelette. Had a friend that ordered the same thing, and he never found much in his omelette either. Very bland omelette, potatoes were OK, coffee tasted like instant. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great place to get some breakfast big portions and unlimited coffee which is always nice especially when  your extremely tired.  Our waitress was really sweet and made my meal that much more enjoyable. Definitely a place to go if you want a big breakfast.   the only thing about the place that I would change is the entrance. There is 2 doors and in the early hours of the morning there is no direction for which door to go to.But then again that's nothing major."}
{"text":"I have NO idea what's up with this place?! Their hours are clearly posted. Every time I check it says their open for business, I show up. NOT A SOUL AROUND!!!!!! Wth?"}
{"text":"Ollie's is a locally owned restaurant. Neighborhood restaurant comfortable, a place to have a nice meal and relax. For this reason alone is a reason to return. I do have a return visit planned. I went for breakfast. They do serve lunch and dinner. Menu is burgers, sandwiches, chicken, fish.  Breakfast was good and they were very willing to tailor the meal to my wishes. Beacon and eggs are hard to mess up and not the best way to judge a restaurant. My meal was good. The service was excellent. My wife got a short stack of pancakes and it was served with hot syrup, just how she likes it.  Oh. I really did like the coffee. Better than most places.  I do plan on going back for breakfast, I will probably not do lunch, but I will probably do a dinner there soon."}
