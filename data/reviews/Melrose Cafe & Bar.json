{"text":"I just don't get you Melrose! I really don't. Your a bar/club but your also a restaurant. Came here on Saturday night. Sat and had two appies on the patio. The Patio was nice we were sitting far enough from 17th Ave that people walking by didn't have their fingers in our food.  Had the vegetarian spring rolls and spinach dip. I have to say both were bland. Both were really \"safe\" in terms of flavor. I like the dipping sauce the spring rolls came with it had a little kick to it which was nice. Over all it was all underwhelming. I had a $100 gift certificate to use however since we only spent $30 all together they don't give you a credit if you don't spend the entire voucher.   Whatever I won it but still. I suppose we will come back and have dinner with friends just to use up the gift certificate. The staff was really nice and attentive. It was a nice atmosphere. I had a good night it wasn't the greatest but it was good none the less."}
{"text":"Have been here several times.  It's still a cool place with a good atmosphere.  Was just here the other night and the service was ok.  Beer selection is ok, but not as good as it used to be as they have gotten rid of some of my fav beers.  Got the nachos.  You would think it wouldn't be hard ot make them well, but they were very average at best.  How do you not put enough cheese on them so that they aren't dry?  Especially at the price they charge for nachos you would think there would be tons of toppings.  It makes me question why I come back here."}
{"text":"It's alright- didn't wow me. Maybe it was the people in the lounge- very very drunk. Also this place doesn't take debit....it's the 21st century and I hate credit cards and don't do cash.  I'm not dying to go back."}
{"text":"I don't normally think of going to a casino for food, but I checked this place out on a Saturday night.  I sat at the bar and had a chicken salad.  The bar tender was really fast and efficient and the salad was delicious.  Nice place to get a reasonably priced meal, that is, if you don't stop by the stupid head roulette wheel on the way out..... :-)"}
{"text":"I am very surprised to see any negative reviews about Melrose.   The bar, right in the heart of the \"Red Mile\" has to be one of my favorite places to go for an after work drink, dinner or lunch with the family, watch the Flames game with friend or a even a date. In general, I really love the place.   I have never had bad service and all of the servers and managers are very pleasant.   The food is great and well priced. I highly recommend the quesadilla, the cheddar bacon burger or the taco salad.   If you have never been to a party or event at Melrose, you are missing out. I try to go to them all because I always know that they are going to be a blast. A DJ, packed crowd, drink specials and even prizes! (C'mon, who doesn't love PRIZES?)  I've never been for brunch, but I have heard great things. They make nutella crepes! I am not really sure what is better than butter, batter and nutella so I must try this delicacy soon. ;-)   In general, Melrose is a fantastic place and in my experience, never disappoints. If you are undecided about going here, I would try it. I don't think you will regret your decision."}
{"text":"We were a table of about 10.  Waitress nor manager was able to handle it, or rather us. We waited about half hour to get water. 40 minutes to take drink orders... Over 1 hour to take food order. Everything was cold when we got it.  The sauces for the steak orders were like a \"blub\" of gel that did not pour out of gravy boat. Everyone got upset. Service was one of the worst ever. Food, nothing to rave about. Would never ever go back there. Over $200.00 for this massive cold confusion? Won't happen twice!!"}
{"text":"I've never been to Melrose as a cafe, it's always been on friday/saturday night.  I don't really have anything really against it, but it's not my scene.  I prefer pubs or a place like the Drum and Monkey to this place."}
{"text":"I have a new favourite breakfast/brunch place in Calgary.  To hell with standing in line at Red's or Diner Deluxe or Dairy Lane. Once you get past the stench of stale beer in the foyer of Melrose, this is where brunch is at.  I've been a longtime Melrose fan, loving the spinach and artichoke dip for many many years. And the Field of Dreams martini. I even had my birthday dinner there last August.   I've stumbled out at 2 a.m., I've watched hockey games and I've Super Bowled there.   But breakfast? You're kidding me, right?  No.   The service I receive at Melrose is incomparable. We Tweet/Foursquare that we're there and they Tweet back 'Hello! Where are you so we can come say hi?' And they do.  Kelsey, our server yesterday, is unfortunately bound for greater things. She leaves Friday for a broadcasting gig in Saskabush. But she can always fall back on a career in the service industry. She's personable, unobtrusive and quick to handle our special requests.  My friend and I each ordered the build-your-own omelette. It's made with three eggs and the stuffings of your choice. It comes with a heaping mound of home fries and two slices of big, fluffy Texas-style toast.   I. Love. Toast.  Oh and the little bowl of fresh berries and pineapple was the perfect touch.  It was delicious but I'm afraid I couldn't finish the whole meal.  But seriously, best breakfast ever.  And most important note of all? Melrose is finally saying 'adios' to Frank's Red Hot in their Caesars and going with the more traditional and delicious Tabasco.  Hallelujah!  (Even so, they still had our special bottle of Tabasco behind the bar, ensured by Sully for Cam.)  Thank you, Melrose."}
{"text":"An update to my experience at Melrose:  After a crummy night at the Libertine Public House (see my Yelp review here: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/libertine-public-house-calgary#hrid:GtjwpJdc2Lj_IsGMtLPWgw ), I just wanted to mention a really cool thing that Melrose did for me.  Long story short, we had bad service at the Libertine, with our server being inattentive, and/or forgetful.  I had arrived around 8 p.m. hungry, and had placed an order for a BBQ Chicken flatbread.  An hour later, the food never came, so my friends and I decided to leave for Melrose instead.  I had asked for the bill as at that point, I just wanted to leave, when I noticed that the flatbread wasn't even on it (good thing too since they never gave it to me in the first place, or they could have just plan forgot to run it through.  I'm not sure which, but either way, I left the establishment hungry).  I had tweeted a little bit about my misadventure in trying to procure sustenance from the Libertine (I didn't name them directly, although those who were paying attention to my Twitter feed would have noticed that I checked in on Yelp there), and I guess the folks at Melrose were paying attention because when I arrived at Melrose, they had a BBQ Chicken pizza waiting for me, complements of them.  Being after 10 p.m. at this point, I was very, very grateful as I was so hungry.  I've had nothing but pleasant experiences at Melrose, and the staff try their hardest to ensure that their patrons are well taken care of.  If you ever have a bad experience at Melrose, don't complain, instead, just let them know (politely, of course).  They'll do their best to make things right, even if it's trying to correct a mistake of one of their competitors.  So yes, Melrose gets an enthusiastic 5 star from me and have earned my loyalty for a while to come now, thanks to this simple gesture they did after a bad night elsewhere.  28/30"}
{"text":"Melrose, contrary to what other reviews have said, isn't the only dinning option in Cowboys Casino.  You can also eat at Zen 8 and the Center Bar, which offers you both Zen 8 and Melroses menu and is normally where I choose to eat.  I work next door to Cowboys and often need to have a quick meal.  Grasslands used to be in the corner where Zen 8 now occupies and was a cheap and fast food option that being the close neighbor of both The Stampede and The Saddledome  offered somewhere you can get a fast meal before your event or for employee's who have a tight schedule.         I normally eat at Center bar for lunch when looking for a fast meal as I can order off Zen 8 menu or order something like 1/2 order of Nachos off the Melrose menu, which shouldn't take more than 15 minutes even when busy.  The last time I will ever order anything from Melrose happened when granted the restaurant and Center Bar were busy, but I ordered before many of the other people around me.   I prepaid at the Center Bar and most of the staff there are awesome, there are some exceptions but that is normal for anywhere.  After seeing people served who still had menus when I ordered and it was approaching 35 minutes later I had to cancel as my lunch time was up.  Luckily I was given Cowboy staff discount as I think they knew it was going to be a long haul, so didn't get screwed as bad as could of been.  I wanted to look the cooks in the eye so went up to where cooks were and told them to cancel my order, I doubt he will care but I didn't have time to wait for a manager as they already wasted enough of my time.  The money they made off me will be paid off by my telling countless customers who are looking for somewhere to eat that Melrose doesn't deserve a one star, you can't see the negative sign.       If you have time to waste, Melrose might actually be a good choice as two fellow employees got their drinks, 2 beers each, for free this past Friday due to lengthy service time.  I value my time more than anything else so I won't order from them again and will negative advertise as much as I  can to dissuade others from having their time wasted as well.  I can remember when Melrose used to be a fun place to go and was the heart of the Red Mile, boy have they gone down hill."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times recently and I'm impressed with this place because their people treat you so well. They smile and greet you and, once you're seated, their waitresses, all of them as far as I can see, act as though they really care if you're looked after. What a treat!  I realize they don't need my endorsement to survive but I sure do want to acknowledge their friendly and caring attitude. I'd have no trouble recommending Melrose to anyone who needs a restaurant, pub or special function suggestion. Thank you people of Melrose."}
{"text":"First time down to Melrose and I have to say I was extremely impressed. Me and the boys mad our way down to 17 to watch the world cup action today and the atmosphere in Melrose was wonderful, service was good and the food( with the limited amount we ordered) was excellent.   I shall be heading back down to Melrose sometime very very Soon... It was that good."}
{"text":"This place definitely has the most tvs per square inch in the entire city. They dubbed themselves \"the heart of the red mile\" a few years ago and have been holding on to it ever since. There's usually a long line-up to get in on weekends, but every time I've been to Melrose I've been satisfied. The food is great and the service has always been attentive, despite the rush. The tvs are excellent for hockey fans, with just about every game in the league on at the same time. But if the Flames are playing, just about all of them switch to that game. If they score, somebody in the bar flicks a red siren and then people caught up in conversation realize the Flames have scored and it's time to cheer. I like Melrose and their patio is terrific in the summer."}
{"text":"Food is always good! Great atmosphere and all around awesome bar to hang out at! Patio is a great place to grab a drink in the summer and the bar is awesome on the winter to watch games!"}
{"text":"It is located in the casino. The drinks are decent, the service is great, and the pizza is grand. They often have drink specials and their is always a game on the screens around the bar. I have only tried the pizza. I keep saying I will try other things on the menu but the pizza gets me everytime."}
{"text":"The service in the resturant is excellent! The waitresses are quick and helpful.  We've been here for several B-day's and functions as it's a great space for parties.    The patios are both amazing in the summer time!  Great for people watching!  The food is tasty, especially their wings and salads.    The reason I don't give it a 5 star not impressed with the service in the lounge, it's a long wait to get a drink and we always tip well, but the service is slow."}
{"text":"Stampede Parking Lot was a mess with Cirque ending & Flames game starting(April 19,2013) so walked over to Cowboys Casino for a bite.   Melrose only eating establishment, so sat and ordered Draft beer Specials & Hawaiian Pizza ... was Good.  Waitress was exceptionally friendly and helpful.   Atmosphere was great too!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place?  It's been like a second home to me since I moved to Calgary 4.5 years ago.  Discovered Melrose on my first walk down the Red Mile and it's been a staple in my life ever since.    Don't get me wrong, when I first moved here most people from Calgary did not understand why I liked Melrose so much.  Most Calgarians did not want to go there with me, so I had to recruit out-of-towners like myself to go for drinks and grub.  I'm not sure why they didn't like Melrose since I wasn't around before, but some of them are certainly starting to turn around now.    I've been to Melrose for supper, late night drinks, lunch, parties, charity events, brunch, and early morning World Cup matches (so fun!).  I won't say that the service has always been consistent, but that's like any place with so many waiters & waitresses moving through all the time.  I have noticed lately that the service has gotten better though, so they must be doing something right.  The management staff are awesome.  Just awesome.  They are very helpful, friendly, and super accommodating when we are making a huge reservation.  They make you feel right at home every time you are there.    Even though I've eaten at Melrose many, many times, I have not tried everything on the menu - shocking, right?!  I have a few favourites that I have found to be tasty every time - the skillet for brunch, calamari for appetizer, and the taco salad for dinner.  I've heard nothing but good things about the waffles as well, but I can't have gluten so no waffles for me *wah wah*.  They also have a good selection of beers, awesome cocktails, and reasonably priced wines, so you can't go wrong there at all.   Another thing I love about Melrose is that they host charity events (YYC4SlaveLake, Holipalooza) and local groups (Social Media Breakfast, Third Tuesdays) quite often, which tells me they are interested in the community.  Yes, it's a bar, but these types of events and offerings make them stand out from the rest in a positive manner.  Plus, it's a great venue for these events - I can still sneak a peak at the sports on the TVs while I'm there!  Sometimes the late-night crowd can be a little iffy at Melrose, but if you're there with a good group you won't even notice.  They used to have awesome DJs, which made for fun nights, but this has changed recently.  It will be interesting to see what they do with the second location opening up soon.    Overall, a great place for drinks and grub or a night out and I know I will be back here many, many times after this post.  Summer's coming and I can't wait to hit their patio, great place to people watch on 17th Ave!"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight at Melrose and it was excellent! I had the fajitas and by friend had the pasta, it was great and the staff was awesome! The manager PJ came over and made us feel very welcome. We will definitely back, now I know what the hype is all about."}
{"text":"I have been in Melrose, first by inviting friends and two more times by invitation from others. I should say I will not give this place more that one star. I don't even know why they call it \"Cafe\"! Extremely over-rated and expensive for what you get. very crowded, and extremely noisy. decoration is nice, though, and that's it! Waitresses are not polite and demand for tip! I will never go there again, if I don't have to!"}
{"text":"Melrose and I have a \"love and hate\" relationship, truly sometimes I think I should just stay away, but on those random nights, when no one has decided on a place to go, and we all go \"I dunno, what's there to do? where should we grab a drink?\" I tend to just blab it out and convince everyone to go to Melrose. Maybe because it so central, it's located right on 17th ave( The red mile). And for those who can remember the crazy, awesome time of 'The Red Mile\" Melrose is such a reminder of those great Flames days! So that's why I come back, I love it when it's packed, when the game is on, people are rowdy and beer keeps coming! But every now and again,  the good turns to bad, can't get it, the line is too big, they refuse to let me in- I have to sneak in through the back, the food isn't so great, there's nowhere to sit, and I say to myself \"why the hell did we pick here!?\" Right, my choice- again. So Merlose and I will go back and forth, until someone opens up another sports lounge the size of Melrose right on 17th.  I'm a dreamer, I know.  ps. I've been to the restaurant/patio twice ever- atmoshpere is great, the food...well let's just say I'm picky ;)"}
{"text":"Before the Calgary Car show, we decided to grab lunch at the casino. I haven't been to the Cowboy's casino since they opened so I thought it'd be nice to check it out.  Melrose is your only dining option at this casino so we walked over and seated ourselves. We grabbed a booth facing the bar which was plastered with flat screen TVs (pretty sweet set up)  Although the daily special listed on the table said \"Pulled Pork sliders - $2 (and on their website!), I asked our server and was informed it's not until after 4PM. Maybe you should include that when advertising the specials!  I went with the fish and chips and my boyfriend got the Melrose burger. The food didn't take to long to come out, and it looked appetizing. The fries came in a small deep fryer basket which I thought was pretty cute - but I later realized how little fries you actually got with your meal.  I noticed the tables are lower than standard tables because we were crouched over our food trying to eat. Kinda annoying.  My first few bites were kinda off, I had to figure out if it was the fish or the tartar sauce that tasted sour - my boyfriend confirmed it was the tartar sauce. I notified the server and she brought me another sauce. Even by comparison of color and smell, you could tell they were completely different. Clearly the first sauce had been sitting out or gone bad - disgusting!  They really take advantage of the fact that they monopolize the casino because our bill was around $40 and we didn't even drink! I wasn't expecting over the top amazing food, but for those prices I would. Next time, I'll just grab some hot dogs and nachos at the BMO center."}
{"text":"We had a company event here about 3 weeks ago and it was fantastic. Like fantastic is hardly giving them enough credit. There was some organization involved and the management went more than over the top to make sure we were happy, had what we needed and the food and service were good. I had stopped in there about a year earlier during the Olympics (I'm from Toronto) and had some good food and drinks. But I didn't realize they have a whole lot of room downstairs for events. We took a couple of the downstairs rooms for our event. My only challenge was finding good sightlines for a presentation. But a small flaw for such great customer service. When I'm back in Calgary, I'm definitely stopping back here."}
{"text":"I'm sad because I wanted to like Melrose more. They do such a great job of supporting many group events my friends and industry are involved in and I've always heard rave reviews.  Somehow in my almost 6 years of living here I have never been to Melrose. I've come close a few times but last minute issues have gotten in the way. Today though I headed there with a couple of friends for brunch (Saturday).  I do have to say the service was awesome. Our server was the perfect mix of attentive but laid back. We didn't feel rushed at any point and she was quick to offer refills on our drinks.  The food, while plentiful and plated in a fun way, was very \"meh\". I had the chicken flatbread club and it was a little too simple and there was far too much mayo on it...to the point I couldn't eat a lot of the sandwich and I'm not picky. Fries were okay but not overly hot -great presentation though.  I'm going to hope maybe it was just me and I made a bad menu choice. I'm totally willing to try them again because so many people I know love it there. But if that weren't the case, based on today's food alone, I'd be indifferent about going back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for breakfast/brunch.  Good quality food and not expensive.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I ordered a whiskey and a glass of water. The waitress brought me my whiskey, but not the water. No big deal I thought, her tray was full since it was busy, so I waited. She never came back. I figured thats cool I can save time by getting it from the bartender. Wow did it turn into a huge ordeal! The counter at the bar wasn't really busy, just two or three people ordering ahead of me. When the bar tender came near I asked if I could get a glass of water. He said nothing, never looked up, never nodded didnt acknowledge me. I wasn't sure if he heard me, but I'm not pushy so I gave him time to finnish what he was doing. Soon he was taking orders of people who were after me. Now I'm thinking this guy is ignoring me on purpose. Why? Cause I'm ordering something that is free and he can't be bothered to poor a glass of water? I was like hey you guys don't serve water here? Then he yells I'm busy, and he said something about being stressed. What is that all about? You're in a service industry. Is this a thing in bars where if you order water, servers laugh and say good luck to you? I was planning on having a few more drinks, but obviously this is not a place I want to spend time in. Loss of sales for a few drinks($20-$50) loss of a customer for life($20,000-$30,000) multiplied by who ever else I talk to, or reads this? Not sure, but I don't think that's good for business."}
{"text":"What's there to say about a sports bar with a great patio? Not much that you haven't already heard.  You like beer? Sports? Patios? 17th Avenue? Chicken wings? Huge pubs? Then Melrose is a place to grab a patio and a drink on a hot day with buddies after work.  The restaurant patio is giant. It's giant by regular patio standards, not just 17th Avenue patio standards. It's actually an okay spot to hang out for Sunday brunch buffet.  The lounge-side patio is really just a series of tables pushed against a low window sill that they open in the summer. If you like to perch with a vodka-water and leer at the passers-by, this is your kind of outdoor space.  Melrose located in the centre of the 17th Avenue restaurant district and boasts being \"the Heart of the Red Mile\". (This is in reference to the 2004 Calgary Flames Stanley Cup run where 1000s of people took to the streets in celebration of every game win; Melrose simply happened to be in a central enough location to be caught in the crowds. All the other bars in that location did just as well with 1000s of people in the street.) This location has kept Melrose afloat ever since.  Heart of the Red Mile or not, this bar is just a summer spot for a drink. With the windows open and the patios packed it's hard to remember that the beer is average and the food never-changing.  Melrose is simply in a convenient location; and it's big enough and vanilla enough to accommodate a large crowd. So if you have a big group that vary widely in food and drink tastes, or are afraid of anything above average, you could take them to Melrose for pizza, wings, beer and high-balls.  T."}
{"text":"I seem to be at Melrose all the time. One of the reasons is because Melrose is a huge supporter of Calgary groups, including mine....Calgary Bloggers.  Between the great space, attentive staff & wonderful management, I think I'll be there more in the future.  Oh...you want to know about the food?  The Melrose Waffles available at brunch are DIVINE.  Covered in bananas foster & whipped cream they are definitely a guilty pleasure.  Bacon and \"never ending\" hashbrowns round out the meal.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Went a while ago and the staff was cool, but management was a dick.   Nobody cares about the bikes. Just because it's St. Patrick's Day doesn't mean everyone's a drunk jackass."}
{"text":"OK, let's be honest. Melrose only does well because of it's location. Being on 17th ave almost guarantees customers, especially if you serve drinks, food and throw some hottie waitresses into the mix. Melrose has this formula down to a science. It's basically a spot where people can park their hot cars and hogs outside, rev the engines, and make eye contact with other wankers. I guess I am saying the crowd can be a little... yeah.  I hate to say it, but I do like their patio. It's up and off the avenue enough that you don't get all the noise and traffic fumes, but you can still people watch and feel like you're in the thick of it. They usually have hanging flowers all over the patio which break up the sun a little, so I've never roasted on this patio.   The food... It's food. I mean, it's what you'd expect. I've never had a terrible meal at Melrose, but that being said, I also can't remember a single thing I've eaten there. So I guess my overall review is \"edible, not memorable\". Drinks are fun. The famous Fishbowl drinks are something to try (do they still do that?). The rest of the bar is standard.  I'd say, if you're looking for a nice sunny lunch on a patio on 17th, this would be a good bet. But keep in mind the patio vibe will probably outshine the food."}
{"text":"Nothing pleases my heart like a sunny, flowery patio, full of beautiful, friendly people.  Enter Melrose.  To date, Melrose has one of my all-time favourite summer patios. I love the heaters for the 'slightly breezier evenings'; I love the fact that the patio overlooks 17th Ave and you can people-watch for hours on end; And I love that everyone on the patio has perma-grins on their faces...okay, this MAY have to do with their choice of bevvies, but regardless, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this patio.  And if you're an early bird who just can't seem to keep them eye lids open past dark, then check out their weekend brunch. 4 words for y'all: Bernard Callebaut Chocolate Fountain. 'Nuff said.  See you there."}
{"text":"What's not to say about the Melrose? Between Breakfast Clubs, birthday parties, and just random meetups for a drink or two (or many, many more), this seems to be the place to be at.  For starters, they are one of the most social media interactive restaurants in town. Between wishing Twitter folk a \"Happy Birthday\" via Tout, responding to complaints (including from other restaurants - see Reginald T.'s review), and interacting with their followers, they have one of the best social media presences in town.  Honestly, I have yet to have had an experience at this bar that has had me say that I'd never return. When the staff do something in error, they are apologetic and do what they can to correct it.  So with all this high praise, why only 4 stars? Here's why:  I am someone who often doesn't carry cash around. That's how I've been since the invention of the debit card and it's mainstream acceptance. These folks don't have debit machines, instead they have you go to an in-house ATM that dings you $1.99 for the privilege to get cash to pay your bill. So, on top of applicable bank fees, $2 vanishes (which may not sound like a lot, but when you've been there as often as I have and forgotten to get cash...well, let's just say by now I could probably have paid for a main or two and a couple drinks).  Unless of course you pay with a credit card (which I don't often have with me).  That said, I really do enjoy this place, and will be back."}
{"text":"Although the typical calgarian will probably disagree with me, i think melrose is an unpleasant place to be and tend to avoid it.  recently i joined a girlfriend for an event here and was appalled, nay scandalized.  upon ordering her second glass of wine, the waitress brought my friend her order in a mini caraffe, then proceeded to take my friend's dirty napkin out of her used wine glass and poured her drink right back in.  but, the waitress looked cute in her blonde ponytail and jersey, so i guess that's what really qualifies her to serve drinks and food at melrose."}
{"text":"Melrose for me has become a regular hot spot. I love the atmosphere, the crowd is decent and the staff care about their customers. The food is typical bar food, consisting of dry ribs to flat bread pizza's to steak sandwiches, nothing to rave about to be perfectly honest, but it fills the spot on nights where the drinks are plentiful.  The staff are awesome, catering to every need or want in various sizes from a table of two, to a table of 15 +. If, for whatever reason there's a problem or complaint they also have a great team of managers who professionally address and handle the situation, both in person, or online.  Thats right, I said online. Many of us have taken to the internet to bitch about our experiences after we've left the establishment, for fear of ruffling any feathers or \"causing a scene\" that might make ourselves or our company uncomfortable if dealt with right then and there. Thanks to Tony at Melrose, they've got their eyes and ears online  On one side they have a nice open space  bright and welcoming restaurant that walks through to a quaint, heated patio for families or for people who enjoy a sit down beverage and (in the summer) catch a few rays. The other side, the bar,  (believe it or not) 3 Levels. It much darker than the restaurant, giving it a nightclub-ish feel with a DJ spinning top 40 on weekends.  I'm slightly confused with the decor, simply because there are giant Chinese? symbols on the wall with various red lighting throughout the three levels, yet, there is nothing asian on the menu (that I've seen). Regardless its still a nice atmosphere and a great place to go on game days, as their walls are also filled with Giant flat screen TV's.   I must heed warning though, the bar seems to attract a lot (but not all) 25-40 year old UFC fan - type men on a regular basis and various age groups for women. So if \"juiced up\" Jersey shore mixed with Tapout and UFC people are your 'thing' then you'll be fine.   If you're looking for a great place to go to have drinks with friends, catch the game, or even tear up their dance floor, I strongly suggest hitting up Melrose for a great night out. Oh, and to fix your hangover the next day, hit up their Sunday Brunch, that hosts a great variety of breakfast goodies. Check out Jenn D's Review on Sunday Brunch :)"}
{"text":"Been to Melrose on several occasions for many reasons.  I've celebrated many birthday parties there lately.  I've had brunch there more than a handful of times.  I've been to Holipalooza.  I've even gone just to watch a hockey game or two and I spent part of my new years eve there this past year.  I always get great service!  Prices are good.  Staff friendly and interactive thanks to twitter.    For birthdays they serve enough champagne for all the party goers on the house complete with sparklers!  My favorite beverage there is the Field Of Dreams martini.    Their brunch is good... nothing fancy, but hits the spot!  I hear the waffles are great, but I love the Nutella crepes with banana.  I don't like hash browns so I opt for a side of fruit for a small fee.  I also dig the eggs benny... so good!"}
{"text":"Last time. At this location. Swear. Or you can tar and feather me. Every time I have eaten here lately I get sick and tonight was no exception. The hamburgers have to be safe to eat right? Nope. Cannot be cooked to order either - I think they come frozen. BAD. You cannot toast a stale bun people - the outcome is that they are still STALE! The yam fries, weird and goopy/chewy in the middle, they ran out of their normal house ones and they are still charging a premium for this crap that they said they had to bring in from elsewhere. $50 tab for 1 small drink each and one \"event menu\" snack item each whereby the yam fries were practically all returned on BOTH. It was brought the staff's attention that they were horrible who could care less.  Bring in the $, get the patrons out quickly as we are Calgary, we can charge crazy-high prices for product and we hope you will still tip BIG even though our service lacks basic principles of caring, efficiency and food knowledge. This restaurant almost cost me my night out as I felt so rotten after eating there. Zero stars. If I could give it."}
{"text":"This place is between a 2-3 star. We do know that we will likely not be back here. Wine and beer - ok. Server - nice enough but very inexperienced. Food - not so good. We had the burger and steak sandwich with upgraded yam fries. Edible but that is about it. The ketchup served was that super cheap kind that is bleh.  The menu is uninspiring; 2 pasta choices, pizza, burgers - that kind of thing. This restaurant is older, tired and in need of a super duper clean - dining area, lounge floors and washrooms.  I agree with others that this is a place to sit on the patio with a drink and people-watch but to us, in this bustling area there are just too many other more favorable choices."}
{"text":"My first night ever in Calgary and my plane gets in late.  No problem, it's a major city and I'm staying downtown... should be plenty of places to eat.  Right?  No.  Apparently this is the best of what Calgary has to offer after 10pm.  You know its bad when you wish you had access to a Denny's, because at least there you could get some good hashbrowns.  This place is like some sort of bizarro upscale high school cafeteria.  Because it's the main late-night eatery, everybody comes here.  You have the stoners in one corner with their flannel shirts, the preppies in suits and ties having a drink after working late, and the jocks in the bar area wearing their Flames jerseys and screaming at the game on TV.  Which you can't hear, because they're on mute so that the other TVs blasting music videos so loud I feel like I'm in a night club.  The only reason this place isn't 1 star is because it's actually open after 10pm and serving (barely) edible bar food.    I'm hoping some compassionate yelper will correct me and point out some decent late night (weeknight) spots in downtown Calgary."}
{"text":"Went here for a dinner party on Saturday...   Wow I'm stunned... remember the days when this place use to be packed?? I was soo disappointed that there were so many empty tables.. pfft.. it didn't take long to figure out why...  1. horrible service.. I can honestly say this was one of the worst service experiences I have ever had! The waitress couldn't keep everything in order, half of our table was served then everyone else.. no refills..she wouldn't even look our way!   2. the food.. o come on.. i had such higher expectations of their menu.. their food is barely on par with your local pub food. O and for the pizzas.. smh.. disgusting.. 2/6 options were so gross.. they try to be innovative but the tastes don't fuse well!   I wouldn't go back here for dining.. during the summer I enjoy it a lot.. just drinkin and ppl watchin."}
{"text":"Tonite was my first visit to Melrose.  Belong to a Meetup group called \"Third Tuesday\", and our meeting this month was held in the lower level room.  Regular Monday food special was the Steak Sandwhich.  I ordered a \"pink, not bloody\" steak & crispy fries - and that's exactly what I got.  For $7, the steak tasted great and I couldn't finish the healthy portion of fries.  Great for groups looking for a room to host a presentation.  The room on the lower level holds 90 people comfortably.  The panel of 4 speakers were broadcast of television screens throughout the room, and using a mic it seemed like the whole room could hear the conversation.  For the lower level of a bar/restaurant this is awesome & ratther difficult to find. *Note - the room holds more than 90 people, but there are pillars in the room which do block views for larger groups.  The staff was incredible.  There were 90 people, and no one waited for food or drinks, and a server was always nearby to take orders.  There was also a staff member dealing with sound and video, and again needs were always addressed immediately.  Really impressed with the service.  Our next \"Third Tuesday\" meeting will be on Jan.19th and we will be returning to this space - I look forward to it."}
{"text":"I don't expect much from a hick town like Calgary but this place embarasses the city.  Rude service and greasy food.  Do yourself a favor and go a few doors down to the Yardhouse.  Not exactly swanky but a serious step up."}
{"text":"The nightlife @ Melrose has a more laid back vibe compared to the more vibrant and livelier venues in calgary like the Roadhouse. Its a more older but sociable crowd that gathers here to either enjoy the Flames games, jam out to great DJ's, or to engage in the usual conversation with other people. Speaking off, theres a stigma that this place is a \"meet market\" which unfortunately misrepresents Melrose. The open space, friendly staff, and hassle-less entrance w/ no cover makes this a great place to hold events."}
{"text":"This was the first bar I went to when I moved to Calgary and it remains my favourite.  It' simply a good bar- not too high end but not trashy either. It' big and has a food amount of seating on the bar side, dining side and on the massive patio  They have a good bar with a decent beer selection, the food is respectable and the service has always been good.  I have always had a food time at Melrose, and I've been there at many different levels of drunkeness."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch as I was at a conference at the BMO Center and this was the closest thing. Food here was very good. Service was excellent despite the fact that they were short staffed and had been slammed by everyone else attending the conference.  That being said our food was a bit slow and half of our table was served before the other half but considering how many people showed up I would say that it was a forgivable offence. I checked in on the Yelp app and the manager gave the 10% off your meal Yelp offer to the whole table which I feel entirely made up for the time we had to wait for our food.  I had the fries with truffle oil mayonnaise and it was great. Also shared the Mac and cheese with a friend and it was super rich and creamy. A total comfort food. Someone at our table ordered the club on flat bread and that looked absolutely delicious.  Definitely would recommend and would come back to if I was near by."}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about Melrose.  This time around I was there for brunch with a several friends from Twitter. It's quite possible this is making Sunday's my favorite day of the week.  There was 10 of us seated in the restaurant side, ordering off the Breakfast menu at 11am. There was waffles, eggs benny, omelettes, skillets, breaky specials, etc etc! You name it, their breakfast menu has it. And what is brunch without Coffee & Baileys! It was a great meal. The food was delicious, the service was friendly and fast, all around great morning.  One thing lead to another, and 6 of us ended up going over to the other side of the building to watch football in the pub. Who doesn't love a place that you can move 20 feet one way and be having a totally different experience! Again, the service in the pub was great. If you watch football, melrose is where you need to be on Sundays. The pub was packed! They had games, prizes, drink/food special, and of course TV's with sound. it's really an NFL-fans dream!  I'd highly recommend Melrose for every kind of night/day out!"}
{"text":"Ooooo....what to give 3 or 4 stars....I'd give 3.5, but will leave room for improvement upon another visit when on the famed \"Red Mile\".  I'd driven by the this bar (with the flames) several times before while cruisin' The Mile, and finally made it here with a friend.  He was famished, and I was just along for the ride (and perhaps a Canadian brew).    I've seen this place super-packed, but we lucked out and managed to find a high table near the bar.  There are definitely some beautiful people and eye candy here....ummm, trying to place the crowd.  It looked sort of yuppie, but isn't that a term from the 80s?  What are the yuppies of the new millennium called?  So, I already ate, but I had to get some \"gravy & fries\" (You Canadians do have some delicacies this displaced Cannuck craves!).  Had this and a couple of Big Rock brews.    Nice place to chill out, watch a game (can't imagine the craziness of a Flames game night), people watch, and get a true Calgarian experience."}
{"text":"So Melrose got closed. No idea why.   I'm glad they are gone. Good bloody riddance. Lets hope a nice sophisticated Jazz and piano bar opens up, with ZERO Tvs."}
{"text":"I have been having brunch at Melrose almost religiously for the last few years and I have pulled many-a-bruncher away from the long wait hot spots. It's close to home, so convenience is a huge factor for me. The dining room is large and can cater big groups and they're usually well staffed for speedy service.   Breakfast the last few weeks has been inconsistent with portion size, but the food is usually tasty. I love the free sample crepes and the fresh squeezed orange juice as well. I had the Smoked Meat Scrambler this past weekend, which was a nice substitute to my usual steak and eggs.  I generally go just for brunch, but I do watch hockey and it's nice to slip over to the sports side to watch the Red Wings play on a million tvs once in a while. There's always drink specials, the servers are nice and I've won several ticket/clothing prizes over the years, just being there."}
{"text":"Great location!  The atmosphere and ambiance is definitely dependent on day/time... Melrose is like a chameleon but it does it well.  The brunch is excellent and worth the wait!  The night life is laid back and not pretentious."}
{"text":"I LOVE Melrose. I make sure I always come here every time I visit Calgary. I think it's mostly because they have such a kick donkey location. It's right in the middle of the action with a huge patio. They have heaters when it's too chilly and sun spots when it's not. The mood lighting on the patio is just right for any occassion.  Even the server we had was pretty decent - that says a lot for Calgary! Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there is bad and good at every restaurant, but some places...some places just have much more bad at them. He was running around with too many tables, but he always sent over someone to check on us which was very much appreciated. The food was quite good and the drinks were creative. If you want something that is a little less laid back - Melrose has that too! Just head inside and you'll find dance music and two levels of attractive people to choose from. The only draw back is the washrooms are only on the first floor from what I could see AND it's so, so, so hot in the basement. Bad ventilation for sure!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?  Our order took 50 minutes from order to table, and then I got the wrong FOOD?!  Waited another 20 minutes to get my order, meantime my party finished their meal while I gulped mine down.  I was disappointed, especially when I've heard so many great things about their original location.  I'll have to try the original Melrose Cafe and get back to you all."}
{"text":"The wings here at Melrose are some of the best in the city especially on a Weds night.  Thick, plump and juicy.  So good.  The patio is huge and there's plenty of seating throughout the bar. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Melrose, oh Melrose. You've been around Calgary for so long. I'm not sure what exactly it is about you that attracts a certain crowd on the weekends, that crowd that seems to go with a sleazy sports bar where 40 year old business men can't decide whether to watch the TVs or the young bar stars who've shown up to see who they can make eyes at or give a little pinch to on their way by. What is it about your bar-side patio that encourages young men to sit there and cat-call to every girl that walks by? If it weren't for this crowd, weekend evenings might actually find me here a bit more frequently. Unfortunately, it's your busiest time and what you're most known for.   BUT, looking past this crowd, and into your establishment any other day of the week, into your brunches, your lunches and your incredibly gigantic and impressive multi-level patio (which looked gorgeous with those ice scupltures on it last winter by the way), there's a Melrose I wish I would've gotten to know sooner. A Melrose with some delightful food (I must have more of the mushroom sauce I tried at the YYC Steakoff and that bocconcini salad I had awhile back... OMG). Friendly staff, great service, and such a commitment to the community, this is the Melrose I hope other Calgarians will connect with.   Not to mention you're well equipped to host a variety of events... plenty of room and audio/visual capabilities, it works well from parties to presentations. I'm looking forward to seeing what other creative ways you come up with to use your space!"}
{"text":"This is exactly what you need it to be but better.  This is a great place to start your evening, before the club, before a concert, before as game.  It is better though because you can add great food and great staff.  The pizzas and burgers are amazing and the salad is amazing as well.  I am sure the rest is great too but I can't bring myself to order anything other than a burgers or pizza and I am here about 3-4 times a month."}
{"text":"I've been to Melrose a few times and the food has always been good.  The last visit was during the blizzard so there were only a handful of tables occupied.  We were seated promptly into a booth.  The menu has the standard selection of sandwiches/burgers, salads, and pizzas.  I decided on the BBQ chicken on flatbread pizza for about $15.  The pizza arrived on a wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was delicious with the BBQ sauce, chicken, and red onions.  There was 8 pieces so enough to share or take home for leftovers.  There's a Christmas tree in the middle of the restaurant and our server explained it was the tree of giving and if people brought in a gift (I can't recall who it would be distributed to), they were entered to win a prize.  I thought this was a great idea for a restaurant to support the community!   Service was great throughout as we had our waters refilled and the manager checked on how we were enjoying our meal.  Great food and service will have me coming back again."}
{"text":"I was at Melrose in the atrium area for a Stampede event on the weekend and I have to say, we had the most sweet, friendly waitress and she was on the ball with beverage service.  I haven't been here in years, but was reminded that the atmosphere has a good vibe and they have good food.  I particularly enjoyed the spring rolls and chicken kabobs.    I was excited to try their new Belgium beer on tap (apparently as of two weeks ago), called Liefmans Fruitesse (aka cherry lager), which was delis!  It was the perfect replacement for my craving of raspberry ale, as recommended by our lovely waitress.    I also noted the cool cell phone booth in the corner.  I don't know how long it's been there or if it's a permanent fixture, but what a brilliant idea.  All busy bars should have several of these."}
{"text":"This is far from \"upscale\".We had reservations for over 20 people for  downstairs lounge, and because I person forgot their ID we had to be redirected to the resturant part.  With such a large table and only ONE sever it was really choatic.  Several of us oreder soem food. Not imprssed at all.  Way over priced. the drinks were \"meh\" . I kept getting the wrong drink.  At the end of the night, the sever was a complete mess, couldnt figure out the bill and brought us the \" correct\" one 3 seperate times. Still i find it funny that other's have dubbed this place\" upscale\". NO WAY!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place!!.. And very nice to have a drink!!.. I love the cosmopolitan there!!.. It is just delicious!!.. The food is not the best I have tried. I wouldn't go back there to eat, but for drinks it is a great place with a very nice atmosphere!!... They have a patio, which is really nice!!.. And if you love sport bars, the basement is perfect for you!!.. I really had a great time there!!"}
{"text":"The staff here were great the other night before the Motley Crue concert. Our server was right at our table when we arrived, got our drinks to us promptly, took our food order in a timely fashion, and got refills at just the right time.  They had a good selection of beers, though the special for the evening was Canadian which was sad. I went with a Swing Span...well a couple of them. For dinner I tried the mac and cheese. It was alright. The sauce was a little thin but the noodles were cooked nicely and the garlic toast was tasty."}
{"text":"I had some friends come in from out of town and were EAGER to get to the hottest, most hip and HAP-A-NAN place!  Given Melrose is always on wheels, I sure hoped we could get in.  And we did!  The weather was beauty, so there were motorbikes lined up outside.  As a Motorbike Meg myself, I was very pleased to see this, it just sets such a cool bad@ss tone, doesn't it?  We were seated right away in the restaurant by a lovely hostess.  My friends had the mushroom and swiss burger and bacon and cheddar burger which said they were \"the best burgers\" they'd ever had.  Maybe it's that Alberta beef :)  The service was great, prompt with some serious water refils , which I LURV!  The only issue, the bathroom wasn't very maintained.  A few clogged toilets (not awesome).  This seems to be a theme, however, in Calgary restaurants.  But why!  Otherwise, everytime I have gone to Melrose I have a pretty good meal and good service.  It's a great location in its hot 17th avenue location across from the Starbucks.  I recommend Melose Cafe and Bar. IF YOU CAN GET IN!"}
{"text":"I've never really been a fan of Melrose.  It seems like a place for yuppie, uptight individuals to congregate and talk about all the other yuppie's in the bar.  I've never felt comfortable having drinks or dinner in this place because I really don't feel like I belong.  It seems like everyone in the bar, including the staff, is judging me and thinking the same thing I am: you don't belong here.  It's just not a very welcoming environment for me.  I'll admit, however, that they really do have a nice patio during the summer.  It fills all the requirements of a good patio; some shade, pretty decorations, and heaters when it gets a little colder at night.  It's a nice way to spend an afternoon for anyone who likes this place... which means it's not a nice place for me.  I find that everything is over-priced in Melrose, even including the water.  Unless someone is treating me a fancy, edgy meal or drinks, I won't be choosing Melrose as a first choice for bars.  It's just not my scene... heck, it doesn't seem like it could be most people's scene."}
{"text":"I know mine is just one of many \"yelps\" on Melrose Cafe & Bar, and I have read both good and bad reviews on it...but I will just give my own opinion. I have only been once so far, for a networking event just recently. Let me start by saying that it is fairly easy to find along 17th Ave SW and I understand it's the \"heart of the Red Mile\". I can sure see why, because when you walk in, it's obvious how busy it would be during Flames nights, right down to the red lighting effects. It is a very spacious restaurant/lounge in the front, with an intimate bar downstairs. My only complaint about the downstairs, is how steep those stairs are as I nearly took a tumble (glad I don't work there!). I didn't bother ordering food, but I did get a smooth-tasting Bud Light (only available by the bottle). The waitress was really nice & on-the-ball. However, I will admit they don't take debit, only credit cards and I would assume cash. Thankfully, I had my VISA on me when I went to pay. I think I would go there again, knowing what I know, but as for you: be careful on the stairs, and bring your credit card! Cheers :)"}
{"text":"Thanks to some new Twitter friends I have been spending some time at Melrose. I'm there with our Sunday #breakfastclub and other socialable events like Third Tuesdays, Calgary Bloggers, and more.  The staff at Melrose are Terrific! Notice the capital T! They take good care of all of there customers, new and old. Friendliest bunch of people around.  Who would have thought of going to Melrose for brunch? Well, now thanks to our #BreakfastClub, I'm there every sunday morning. Some great options on the menu and if only once, you need to have the waffles! Need to alter your breakfast choice a bit? No Problem! They accommodate everyone's needs! Consistently great quality food by the Chef.  Often we end up staying after brunch to watch football on one of the dozens of TV's displaying every single game going on.  Like watching hockey games, then this is a nice place to do it. A few beers and some good eats makes it a good time.  For our private functions, Tony and the staff take phenomenal care of us. There are three levels to Melrose and they can set you up in the perfect space or corner for your event. They go the extra mile!  Check it out, you will be pleasantly surprised. I was!"}
{"text":"It wasn't bad and it was the cheapest place for a Coors.  The bartenders are friendly.  Being right in the middle of 17th also helped."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for Mother's Day brunch. We weren't sure when the place opened and had not made a reservation. We arrived about 10 minutes before the restaurant opened and the host welcomed us and directed us to the bar area as the restaurant area was fully booked. I wish we could tell you how the food was but unfortunately an angry and apparently baffled bartender approached us seconds after we sat down in the bar area and said, \"I'm not sure how you got through the doors but we're not open for another 20 mintues so you can't sit in here.\" So we left and went to the Galaxy Diner, which was delicious and had great service."}
