{"text":"Wow! What happened to this place?! Crowne was my regular go-to and to date is one of the best philly cheese steaks I've ever had. In fact people from as far as Mississauga and Oakville would travel down just to partake in delicious philly cheese steak-ey goodness. And then things changed. I'm not sure if there was a turnover in management or someone just stopped trying, but dear God it's terrible now. And even worse than the disappointment of the new sandwich is the horrible service. For years I gave this place second chances but unfortunately there are no more chances left to give. Crowne, you had a loyal following that you lost. I suggest you change your attitude towards your customers, start producing quality food and go back to your original recipe or else you will be left a king without a crown."}

{"text":"I noticed there r a few negative reviews for this place, based on their food/service at the previous location on Steele's.  Happy to say I had a better experience.   If I were to judge this plain, and freezing cold restaurant based on esthetics alone...I would never have eaten here.   Lucky for me, a friend treated me to take-out a week earlier and got me addicted to the Philly Steak    So a week later, I gave in to the constant craving for a 2nd Philly Steak and stopped in to buy one.   The atmosphere is dull, and thanks to sub-zero weather it's cold inside, annnd the young cook is not exactly a people-person.  But the owner seemed very nice as he served two adolescent boys who paid with a pocket full of change, so that made up for the younger guy who served me with his blank stare.   What this place lacks in fancy decor it makes up for with the delicious Steak or Chicken \"Philly Steak\" they serve.   It's not the typical bland blah ho-hum Philly I've tried elsewhere - this Philly deserves to be on a golden platter with angels floating around it, playing tiny harps while looking adoringly at the Philly!!! Yes - it's really that good.   The seasoning in the meat reminds me of Bihari Kabob or Pakistani flavors and u can order it Spicy or Mild.  They do have a small paper take-out menu with several other dishes I'll have to try. So I'm giving this place      for now.   Also, there was a 2nd menu for Desi food taped to the counter with a different business name?? Not sure why,  and young guy didn't seem to speak much English when I tried to ask about the restaurant.  Sighhh   No menu or store name on the wall to be sure which place I was in.. finally noticed a name on the cash register  and confirmed it was indeed Crown Pizza but still wasn't sure if it's Pakistani or Middle-Eastern influenced food.    Can't wait to go back again, I'm already craving another Philly Steak"}
