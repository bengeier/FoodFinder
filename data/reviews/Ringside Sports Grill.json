{"text":"My friends and I stopped in here to get a bite to eat and honestly I am disgusted by what I saw. Do not bring your kids here this is not a place for children. I walked in and ran into a girl I used to go to highschool with keep in mind this girl is still in highschool does not graduate till 2018. These girls are the age of 18 and under prancing around in bikinis and heels. The girl that I went to highschool with is 16 years old!!! This is illegal!! I am appalled with what I saw. I honestly think this place should be shut down. No child under the age of 18 should be exposed to this life style. Even hooters has a classier atmosphere. Not to mention the service was terrible. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Just left this place with my friends  bikini girlz so nice beer draft ice cold..Nice!!!..."}
{"text":"Absolutely great food served fresh, family owned and locally owned. This is not a fastfood place, this is quality. Great place to hang out and watch all the good fights, not to mention get a little eye candy. The shrimp tacos and wings are to die for."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I've been coming here a long time, but since the new owner Kelly took things over, there have been consistent improvements to the place and it seems to get better every time I stop by.  Come with an appetite or thirst and you will be satiated!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger and home-cooked style fries. The atmosphere of this place is perfect for the right occasion. I will only be in town for 10 days and I guarantee that I will be back to watch a game or two. Two ladies that helped me was very courteous and especially AJ. Thank you"}
{"text":"My order was canceled 30 minutes after placing the order. No explanation. I was looking forward to trying something new, I won't try ordering there again."}
{"text":"Came here to watch a fight parking lot was jam packed. Super crowded but the beer was cold and service was surprisingly great considering how many people there was. Not sure if we'd come back since there it was overcrowded and little to no space left and the kitchen was backed up an hour so we didn't even consider ordering food. But the people around us that did have food looked really good. Too bad we couldn't get to try it. Prices are cheap too."}
{"text":"Don't waste your hard earned money here. My family and I got kicked out on game day with our jerseys on. This place took a dump under new management. The girls are all ugleeee and disgustiiiing now. They will never survive this fall."}
{"text":"Food was pretty dang good fries rocked and the Julio burger tasted pretty darn good too.. as per owner who was serving us nothing frozen and fresh cut veggies daily.   Specials food menus items daily. The  reason I did not give it a higher score is because they could work on their appearance  as  I am a clean freak it wasn't to bad but would say it Clarifies  as a whole in the wall but hey sometimes a diamond in the rough where you find pretty darn good food and nice people. We will be back next time we are on this side of town.."}
{"text":"When searching for dive bar with best wings in the area, this place has it on lockdown.  It's right off the 17 and is a tad run down - but what do you expect in a dive bar?  Right when we walked in the waitress was very friendly and explained that they had a lunch special ('Wing it' Wednesday) and a patio for outdoor seating now that it's cooling down.  Wings + a beer + fries for $6 is tough to beat.  Granted, there were only four wings in the special, but they were really tasty (I got the hot).  They also have fancy sauce they can bring with the fries (ketchup + mayo) which was a nice touch.  There weren't many others here but it was a Wednesday afternoon so that's not all that surprising.  I'll be back and will recommend this to anyone who asks and wants a place to stop for a drink and bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal burgers! Small place but amazing food, I highly recommend if you're in the area wanting a quality meal. Cold beers makes it a plus"}
{"text":"Walked in because I heard it was a Bikini bar, but it wasnt which okay thats fine. But the beer was warm, and reading under new management they started to go downhill i finished it and left."}
{"text":"This place is shady. We walked in and the first thing we saw was a group of Mongol gang members. We decided to give the bar the benefit of the doubt and stayed for a drink. My husband asked for a beer and I asked for a whiskey sour. The bartenders looked underage and had never heard of the drink. I got some green concoction that tasted terrible. I do not recommend this place. The bar doesn't even look legit on the inside."}
{"text":"Really good food!!! Great place to watch sports, Highly recommended they also have a secret menu \"Vietnamese food\""}
{"text":"I just had the pleasure of eating at this place and all I can say is wow people don't know what they are missing this place is pretty new still so people do t know it exists and boy are they missing out . Everything is homemade !! There is a to die for bacon grilled cheese called the No Whammies Grilled cheese all I can say is NO WHAMMIES!!! Get here now !!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times and I am already a huge fan! I enjoy the friendly service everyone provides and the great food they make! I have previously ordered the hot chicken wings and the jalapeno poppers. Both have been so delicious. I am always bragging about those wings! The flavor is so different from your common hot chicken wings, these have real flavor!   One of the other great things about this place is the games they offer for you to play with friends. I find it so awesome that is not your common dive bar where you go sit and drink only. No! they have games like jenga, loteria, uno, and many others. i have a really good time each time I go.   I got hungry now :("}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Checked in on me and my boy the whole time we were here. Food pretty decent at reasonable prices but did very well to try to accommodate me. Worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"To be Honest the place didn't look too inviting during night time, but since you are not suppose to judge a book by its cover me and my friends still decided to try it out.  At the end, we were glad we did.  Staff was nice and attentive, and the food was delicious.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The entire experience was overall fair. Our waitress was new and a bit slow, having to check with someone else to ask about each drink. The drafts appeared to be down so it was bottle only for beer. We split a burger and wings and neither were great. Another server, Lily, ended up helping out toward the end so that helped. I'm not sure what the uniform is but there were two girls in booty shorts and another in a thong so this is definitely not a place to bring children. There was only one speaker and it was blaring from the bar the entire time so it was difficult to hear. We left reeking of fried food. I doubt I would go back based on this experience."}
{"text":"I'm a little late in wring this review but finally there's a place for boxing fans to go and watch fights and is also a boxing themed/style bar to hang out at. The owner and waitresses were very nice and would sit down with u and just chat. Cute girls btw! No other place does that. They also have great wings....finally a spot that puts the \"hot\" in hot wings. So delicious! Def recommend this place."}
{"text":"The idea of a Boxing Themed bar/restaurant is an excellent one, unique and the inside is well detailed for that theme.  They show most of the fights on their TV's.  The food has always been good, the scenery is excellent and their social media promotion of fight events and food specials are very useful.  I highly recommend Ringside, especially for fight fans."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had the burger and fries. The food was just ok. GF said half of her burger had way too much salt seasoning and was hard to finish. The server was friendly but inexperienced. Oh and a biker gang did roll in towards the end of our meal. A bit intimidating although they didn't seem to bother anyone. Too many other restaurants to try so I wouldn't go back. Grade C-"}
{"text":"This place is under new management and don't like new patrons. I have felt so unwelcome.  I miss bikini girls, a pool table a large projector. Don't waste your time with place.    It's going going downhill real quick. Bring back old management!!!!!"}
{"text":"First visit: Months ago Last visit: 01/31/2016  We don't review restaurants, but this is the kind of place that makes us want to just so people read this and understand that we know what we are talking about when it comes to places like this. You don't find an establishment like this too often: great food, great people, and a great atmosphere. And they are still just getting started and each day it appears as if they add something new so that the friends who walk through the door feel like they made the right choice. And yes we said friends, not customers. No one is treated like a customer or a number or a dollar sign at RingSide. The other day we went there to watch the Pro Bowl and I walked in and everyone said my name as if I was Norm on Cheers. It was a great feeling. Then I sat down and had an angry orchid that the owner specifically went out and got for me, devoured their deliciously fresh jalape√±o poppers, and loved every minute of being there. So if you are just passing through and want a Hooters, Tilted Kilt, Twin Peaks, or Bikinis type of experience with better food and much better service; this is the place to go. Or if you are a local and you want that Cheers experience of that place to go, be valued, have fun, and never want to leave; this is your place."}
