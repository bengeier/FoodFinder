{"text":"mushroom market has been there for over 40 years... The ladies there are nice and friendly... I highly recommend the potato salad and antipasto."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for a decade.  Awesome people and great food.    I love their beer-battered zucchini fries and eggplant parm sandwich."}
{"text":"Went there today to get some lunch meat. The employee there was extremely rude to me.  She got the first item I asked for then went to the register. I wanted something else and the look she gave me was scary. So I asked if there was a problem and she said real snotty \"we close at 5\". The door was open and the open sign was on but apparently it was closed and I was preventing her from going home to celebrate Columbus Day. So I will not be going there anymore. There are a lot of other places who will take my money."}
