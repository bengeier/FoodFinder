{"text":"I had a great time at this place. For how busy it was I was greeted and treated kindly. The food was great and I don't have a complaint. If you're looking for affordable greasy fatty food. This is the place for you."}
{"text":"I really like the chicken here. The breading is really flaky and unique.  I've had the tenders and the buffalo chicken sandwich, I think the best sauce is the honey mustard for the tenders.  A friend had the gyro and said it wasn't bad either, as well as decent fries too.  One weird thing about Papa D's is that they appear to be either understaffed or having some management issues. When we went there the guy taking our order said that the cook had called off and it would take him much longer to cook all the food.   No cook, huh?  I've never been to the bar downstairs, either.  3 stars for decent food, location and cost, but you need an actual cook if your restaurant is open!"}
{"text":"This is an average bar on Green Street. Most of their items are overpriced for the amount of food you actually get. However, every weekday, there's a special at night time special such as 0.50 pizza slices. This is most likely how they balance their prices: sell their food for expensive during the daytime and then sell them for super cheap during the late night. They're known for their chicken strips and I definitely have to say that the skin of the chicken tastes much different than other chicken strips I've ever had. It was hard to describe it; it tasted.... Artificial I guess is the best way I could describe it. If you're looking for late night food and/or alcohol, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Struggle. Struggle bus. Can't get food out at all. There's a mad house in Here of people waiting for their food. It's been like 15 minutes to get some chicken strips"}
