{"text":"I'm generally a fan of buffets and Chinese food, but was very disappointed -- enough to pick up my keyboard which I have not done in a while on yelp.

It's been a long time since I went to the previous incarnation of this place, so i thought I'd try the new one.

Wait service was good -- fast to seat, fast to refill, fast to clear, fast to check. Nice, helpful to answer questions. That was the best part of the experience.

The buffet selection was reasonable -- heavy on the chicken dishes vs beef or pork, but that's OK with me.

However, much of the main buffet food was so overcooked that it was extremely hard to chew. Dry is an understatement, I had to wash every bite down. The exceptions of what I ate were the broccoli chicken and salmon. , which were OK. I can't really comment on the flavors, because I'm not sure I got them.

As for the sushi, they have a menu of what they have, except that they don't have it. Further, the sushi chef acted like he was doing your a favor to prepare something. Finally,  the sushi itself had tiny slivers of fish it in --- less than a garnish.

There was also a hibatchi grill (as per the name) which seemed to have a reasonable selection of protein but very limited selection of what you could add beyond that. Given the trouble I had getting a sushi chef to do anything and given the limited choices, I did not even bother trying to get something from the grill.

I'm not a dessert fan, but this was pretty marginal as well. OK carrot cake, a handful or other baked goods that seemed dry/stale to me. Melon was fresh. Maybe they are trying to get everyone to eat healthy."}
{"text":"After reading what the cretins have posted on here I had to give an HONEST opinion.
It's not what it used to be. When the new people took over from the old Evergreen 3-4 years ago it was one of the best I've EVER eaten at but it lately has started to show it's age. Face it people you're not going for haute cuisine!! And for Christa... I'm sure they can live without YOUR business."}
{"text":"I live in California and last year started travelling to Pittsburgh on business.  I found City Buffet's Web site on the Internet (CityBuffetPittsburgh.com) -- and I am happy I did.  Every time I am in Pittsburgh I enjoy their tremendous buffet of variety seafood (calamari, mussels, salmon, shrimp, crab legs, etc.) , chicken and pork items.  Sometimes they even have frog legs.  Delicious!  The soups and vegetable items are so well cooked.  Much to my delight, the excellent hibachi and sushi items are included in the buffet price!  The desserts and fresh fruits give a pleasant finish to the meals.  My wife who is a sushi enthusiast and business partners started coming with me.  They not only and find the food great, but also find the location, the easy access to the restaurant and large parking lot well-worth the visit."}
{"text":"It is probably a bad sign or the waistline when the manager of a Chinese Buffet knows you on sight, knows exactly what you will go for on the buffet line and brings you a glass of your preferred beverage before your arm is out of your coat sleeve.   But it is a very good sign when it comes to service.

If you are looking for a decent Chinese buffet with a friendly staff and a wide selection of great food, you might consider a trip out to Monroeville.  The food at City Buffet is almost always hot and fresh and there is something to please everyone in the family.  (As with most buffets, you have to go there at peak times.  You can't go an hour before closing and expect the food to be all that fresh.)  

Even though it has been renovated recently, the decor is not the greatest (like someone took a typical kitschy Chinese Restaurant circa 2000 and dragged it through the 1980s) but it is something I am willing to tolerate in the name of satisfying my deep spiritual cravings for won ton soup and a little sesame chicken.

I don't care for sushi, but my Japanese friend has assured me that it is actually pretty excellent and it is made to order.  If the egg rolls are a little lackluster, I find the rest of the food is excellent.  Just keep your eyes out of the black pepper chicken.  Its mine.  All of it.

(This establishment used to run under different management under the name \"Evergreen.\"  It is a completely different place now and has been so for 2-3 years.)"}
{"text":"Awful! I will never eat here again. The place closes at 10:30 and my mom and I went a little before 9:00. The food was cold, I had to ask several times for sushi to be made. There was no one at the hibachi station so I had to request that someone come to cook my food. Then, when the chef did finally arrive (he had been sitting down eating with other staff members) he was chewing and I had to tell him to wash his hands!! The smell inside was also really gross. I had been here before and it was never as bad as this experience, but this was enough to keep me away for good."}
{"text":"I have no idea how the food is. Because this restaurant has closed. Note to all future eaters."}
{"text":"This is seriously the worst chinese buffet I have ever been to.  The selection was decent.  Not huge like some of the better buffets, but not sparse either.  The problem was the food tasted terrible.  Plus I usually like to get  stuff from the hibachi section, but that was not open.  You could see where it used to be, but it was half disassembled, and clearly no longer in use.  So that was a bit of false advertising on their part, because the sign still said Hibachi Grill.  I have been to some lackluster chinese buffets before, but this one is definitely the worst."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. I'm a picky eater and there isn't much I like here. The reason that keeps bringing me back is this one dish they make called 'Cracker Chicken'.  Bascially is breaded white-meat chicken in a sweet/spicey sauce.

The rest of their food is just like every other Chinese Buffet in the area. 

DO NOT come here on a weeknight. There isnt enough customers to keep the food fresh and often times it sits there for a long time.

The staff arent very friendly, the place is very dirty, and you always feel like you are being rushed out.

Your milage may very..."}
