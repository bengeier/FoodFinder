{"text":"The cafe seems like a cool idea: cute decor, view of Playhouse Square, etc. but the service wasn't great, and the glasses were dirty, and maybe this is just my California taste for fish, but the salmon wasn't good at all :(  Potatoes were delicious though!"}
{"text":"A refreshingly cool breakfast and lunch spot at Playhouse Square. Many vegan options, but they serve meat too! Service is typically slow, but the food is top notch, fresh and inventive. They are open Saturday mornings which is rare downtown. The omelets are large and the walnut raisin toast is wonderful. (Sometimes I stop just for the toast!)"}
{"text":"Quick, yummy, healthy breakfast. Great options for vegetarians and vegan. I had the tofu scramble. It was very well seasoned. Kind service"}
{"text":"took an EXTREMELY  long time to get our food. when we did, it was obviously microwave reheated-hot in spots and cold in others. the black bean soup was water with beans and onions in it. almost no flavor at all. The vegetable shepherd's pie was a an overcooked mush with cooked potato chunks on top. the servers were attentive and friendly but either not very good servers, or stuck with a poorly managed kitchen. Just avoid this place."}
{"text":"Sitting at a window table, looking out at Playhouse Square chandelier. LOVE LOVE this place. Every meal I've had is so yummy. Brunch or dinner   The ingredients are fresh and served so quickly.  My daughter noted that it is so intimate, they must make the food right away and serve it.   Plenty of vegan and vegetarian options. As well as delicious salmon,  chicken or steak entrees.  The only thing I missed with brunch was a mimosa.  No alcohol.  But don't let that stop you.  It's fantastic"}
{"text":"A great take on healthy food.  It tastes to good you wouldn't even know your eating healthy.  You must try the drinks too, the ginger be healthy is Amazing."}
{"text":"A great place for lunch. In town for a conference and it was one of few places open in Playhouse Square for food, however it would be a nice choice even if that wasn't the case. Lots of healthy options for vegan, vegetarian and gluten free. No veggie burgers and fries on this far more creative menu. The spicy Szechuan bead curd is spicy, as said, and tasty. I really enjoyed the peanut maple drink. Such an interesting combination of flavors in drink form. Yum!"}
{"text":"Customer service at a unique place like this is important, unfortunately they failed.   My boyfriend and I just found this cafe this semester (CSU students), which seemed like a great spot. Although they can be pricey, they offer all types of food including vegan/vegetarian options. We have gone here over a handful of times, and as long as you have the right person making your food it can be great..  Though we had a young man make our food one time and he didn't ask us of our diet options and put ingredients our diet cannot have. Knowing that it must have been a mistake, they replaced our food but only half of it.. Not very happy about it.  Then we had come back again, understanding it may have been frustrating at the time for them. This time they denied serving us a half hour before they were closing. Only to offer what was left of the premade food in the fridge. Obviously we left.  For a place like this I would expect great customer service and almost a fun experience trying new heathy foods you aren't used to! Unfortunately, that's not the case. Don't know if we'll be back since the customer service doesn't match the price."}
{"text":"This place took an hour to serve us two omelettes. AN HOUR. TO COOK EGGS! If you see that they have more than three tables to serve do not go in there and order. The food will take far too long! And they brought my side of fries burned."}
{"text":"delicious and healthy breakfast at a very reasonable price!   We sat down at the Wyndham for breakfast where we greeted with a price of $14.95 to help ourselves to a buffet.  Not being very hungry and feeling that we were headed for a high priced disappointment we walked down the block instead.  I'm really happy that we did!  We walked in to Phuel.  I asked what the best breakfast was, and Branden told me to order the Branden (not on the menu).  A spinach, feta breakfast sandwich on walnut raisin toast.  It was AMAZING!  So delicious!!!!   At $4.95 with free coffee it was a much better value, even when I paid an extra $4.00 for fresh squeezed OJ.  Also amazing.  You can tell when the juice was a whole orange moments before drinking it."}
{"text":"I got the buckwheat noodles w/ salmon and veggies,a side of sweet potato fries and the kale aid. Everything was so good! If you enjoy light,healthy yet delicious food, this is the place to go! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I decided to give this place another try after bad customer service. Same darn thing happened again today and we only ordered smoothies. The owner needs an attitude adjustment. Seriously"}
{"text":"Phuel is quickly becoming my favorite place to eat. They find the perfect balance between tasty and healthy. Never have I ordered the same thing twice, and everything I have tried so far has been innovative and delicious, phuel is a must try."}
{"text":"Great place for a coffee and quick breakfast. This is a local restaurant with a diner feel that offers a variety of healthy food options and has friendly  staff. It's good to have places like this downtown."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a wedding this weekend and stumbled upon Phuel Cafe on Sunday. The staff was incredibly nice and friendly. The food was excellent. I had an egg sandwich with Swiss and spinach on wheat toast which was excellent. Also had a great unsweetened black iced tea. Wish we had a Phuel near my apartment in Manhattan."}
{"text":"Such a gem in this neighborhood! This has been my go-to place for healthy food while playing for 3 weeks at the Connor Palace theater. They are incredibly fast when you need something to go and have lots of delicious options.. The Kale salad with honey-lemon dressing is great, I get it every time. Lots of bowl options with brown rice, real leafy green salads to go, etc. Healthy and fast.. and very tasty. Great customer service as well. It blows my mind that a health food place like this uses plastic bags, no recycling or compost, etc. but that seems to be the norm for Cleveland in my short experience here.. my hotel literally just doesn't recycle bottles or cans.."}
{"text":"Wow! I was blown away by the quality of the food and friendly service. I just moved from Florida to Cleveland and it's VERY difficult to find Healthy AND Tasty food and at amazing prices. Very cute location...I will be back time and time again. My 4 year old loved the baked potato fries, and I had the kale salad with the salmon entrée. Im usually tired after a big meal and I felt amazing. Phuel café is much needed in Cleveland, and I highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"The only place where I can consistently walk in hungry, eat a healthy meal, and leave full and energized. Fresh juices made to order. Try the whitefish omelette! Highly, highly, highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The service was amazing and the owner was incredibly sweet! He was super accommodating to being vegetarian or vegan! The food was incredible. The salad and noodle bowls were the best I've ever had. I definitely recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"Popped in here because I had a work obligation in the area and have been wanting to try this place forever. It was about 11:45am and there wasn't a big lunch crowd yet. We got sat right away with waters at our table within minutes. I got the salmon and buckwheat noodles & veggies with the Kale mango side and my colleague got the chicken salad sandwich with sweet potato fries. Everything was delicious and fresh. My portion was huge and only $10 so I took half home.  All in all it is a great place to get healthier fare for breakfast/lunch/dinner. They serve breakfast all day btw! I'll be back for sure. If I lived or worked downtown regularly I would be there all the time."}
{"text":"The food and service are both fantastic. I learn something new about Cleveland every time I come in."}
{"text":"As a performer, I wish there was a pHuel Cafe located next to every theatre. For real. The Ginger Get Well is amazing, along with the Green Smoothie. Everything on the menu seems to be amazing as well. The owner is quite a cool dude, wait staff is brilliantly chipper and knowledgeable. For this quality of food, the prices are unbelievable. This place rocks."}
{"text":"Great place! The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is clean and cute. The food is extremely fresh and many products are organic. I had the chicken salad sandwich and my friend had the buffalo chicken dish. We both got a side of sweet potato fries. Service was fast and not many people were there due to the fact that we waited until after the lunch rush to go!  Loved it and I will be back. My only complaints are that it's a little more expensive and they had trouble running my Master Card. Otherwise perfect. I've heard they have great breakfast so that'll be our next visit! This place is a great representation of Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Checked this spot out when my husband and I were in town for business.  We each got different varieties of egg sandwich for breakfast.  Mine had spinach and goat cheese and his had mushrooms, shallots and goat cheese with the egg.  The sandwiches were super filling with really good quality ingredients.  It was also very reasonably priced ($4.95 for the sandwich and coffee).  Quick service for our to-go orders, and I'd definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a quick breakfast in the area.  Conveniently located too, though I would imagine parking might be tricky sometimes."}
{"text":"Really a pretty poor experience. My fiance and I met a friend there before heading to the theater see Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, and it's a good thing we gave ourselves about an hour and a half. We got there and the sit-down portion was full, so we took seats at the \"bar\". It took a bit of time for someone to get to us; I assume he was either the manager or owner. The menus he gave us were nothing like what was on the website, and was missing a dish or two we had planned on getting. However, as people came and went picking up food, they were ordering things that were neither on the menu or on the chalk wall next to the kitchen, which was confusing. The water was brought to us in tiny Ball mason jars, maybe 8-10 oz? We ordered tea, which was a small pot of hot water and a tea bag - $2.50 each. Our companion got her (main) salad first, about 20 minutes after ordering. Shortly after I got my sweet potato fries which tasted like they died in the window, and my fiance got her soup, which was bland and needed all of the salt. 10 minutes later someone brought two plates over that weren't ours. After making eye contact with the owner/manager, he realized we hadn't gotten our food yet. Apparently they hadn't even fired it yet. 45 minutes after arriving, me and my fiance got our food. My chicken salad sandwich was pretty good, but her mushroom plate was bland and needed more salt. I had to ask for more water, because 8 oz just doesn't do it, and he never came over a single time. Didn't apologize that we had to wait 45 minutes for food, and still charged me $30 for what ended up being really pretty bad food. For all of the other options in the area, I would have hoped they'd been better. A great letdown."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant across from the Idea Center Building and Playhouse Square. They  serve healthy & fresh foods that provide energy & phuel for your body. They also have a lot of vegan and vegetarian food. The place is small, but quaint with a great view of the PHS chandelier. I recommend this place for brunch, lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Lots of potential here with a range of offerings for standard fare (omelets) as well as more adventurous fare (kale-aid, anyone?).  I LOVE that they have a varied menu with lots of organic, veg/vegan/gluten free options that are clearly noted on the menu.  They also have protein for carnivores like me!  Chicken, steak and salmon are add-ons.  I went with the seasonal salad with romaine, strawberries, walnuts and goat cheese with griled chicken and balsamic dressing.  Good but I felt it was missing something.  Knowing my palate I was looking for the taste of bacon...ha ha.  Service is great.  Takeout and delivery through Eat Street are available.  A great addition to downtown eats."}
{"text":"I got the portobella panini which wasn't even a panini.. It came on a bun! Completely tasteless and the salad it came with was doused in so much vinaigrette that it was disgusting. Overpriced for the quality, have to go down to the basement of the building through an elevator to even get to a bathroom. Service was meh."}
{"text":"Well yummy in one word and funny in second word. Came in last nite for dinner break( loading in show at the State). Had the salmon with buckwheat (soba) noodles n roasted peppers with onion ... Delectable. My husband had steak firebowl. Did a ck in on yelp and for free desert too! Carrot cake & lime curd were also delish.  Got to jibber jabbering with the owner/ server / cook.. He forgot R iced tea which he made a point of telling us its special ordered from Thiland... We forgave him for a minute.  We left walked across at to Starbucks called him and teased him we had to come here to get R iced tea!! He ran out the door and laughed n said I owe u a tea!! We all laughed and continued on R evening. I was excited to come back cause the breaky menu looked good too! So here we r for another fabulous meal. Waitress sat u down and it immediately got packed.  So he ordered last omlet on menu and added salmon..Mmm good. Told waitress owner owed us an iced tea from last nite. I had $4.95 egg breaky, also good and walnut, banana , drk chocolate pancakes with maple syrup. Oh my. Had to take some with to go. Well we got pancakes dry. Said she'd get butter n syrup. I'm eating.. Almost done with my eggs an she brings container. Thinking wow this is clear syrup ... And continues to pour. Then we realized it was labeled honey!! Crap now honey on cakes ( still waiting for butter). As she came around again I showed her the label and she apologized. Brought us maple soon. Then butter.  Pancakes cold now. Got R bill , we understand the xtra charge for salmon but did get billed for tea...oh well.  Food good. We were shaking R heads when she told us she been waitressing for 20 yrs, just 1 1/2wk here.  Well dinner elsewhere Tonite!  Food was great tho and worth the stop. Otherwise would have given a five star."}
{"text":"Oh man...I REALLY wanted to love this place. The reviews have been amazing, the location is perfect and the menu looked delicious. Let me just start this review by saying that I came here with a friend on our lunch break so I get that it could be busy. I would also like to say that I will be back to try something else, because I don't believe in giving a place a mediocre rating and then never returning to see if my experience improves. BUT...This review is for this visit only. Ok, let's begin shall we:  Like I said before, my friend and I came here on our lunch break so by the time we got there it was around 11:30. Neither of us had been there before and the host was very friendly and helped us get acquainted with the place. We both looked the amazing menu over and both decided on omelets to go. I got the pHuel gravlax, herbed goat cheese, fresh tomato, shallot and capers omelet. She got the carmelized onion, mushrooms and goat cheese omelet. Both came with our choice of toast, house potatoes and fruit. Despite it being around lunch it wasn't that busy inside. We had ordered and then a small rush came in like 5 mins later so we assumed we were good. I ordered the green smoothie to drink while we waited, which was warm but good anyway. By the time it got to be almost noon my friend had to leave bc her boss is not as lenient with the lunch hour as mine is. So I stayed behind waiting for our food and the host kept coming over asking if I was STILL waiting and telling the cooks to hurry up bc I had been there for a long time (at least 20 mins at that point). I wasn't upset (and still am not upset) or anything I just didn't expect to be waiting around that long for an omelet. The people that work here are extremely friendly and made my wait more palatable.   Ok so back to the food: the potatoes are delicious!! You don't get many but it's a good portion for lunch without making me feel tired later. The gravlax (cured salmon) was good and the herbed goat cheese was OMG good. I was disappointed that the fruit we were supposed to get only consisted of one half of a strawberry and one small slice of pineapple. :( I love fruit so I was hoping for more. My order also didn't have my toast that I ordered in it so my friend let me have one of her slices. Overall the meal was decent but I'd probably order something else on my next visit.   And that's the main thing here...although this visit wasn't the greatest, the intriguing menu and very friendly staff made me want to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast spot right in the heart of Playhouse Square.  Perfect especially for guests staying at the Wyndham down the street - see my review!  Absolutely try their green apple and ginger breakfast drink.  Tastes wonderful and is served in a cute mason jar.  The salmon egg sandwich was also spot on.  Prices aren't too bad - especially for the great location - right in front of the sparkling chandelier!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Looking at the awesome menu online I was super excited to try this place for the first time. Employees were rude. Subpar, sloppily prepared food. The burger was dry and lacking toppings that the menu said it had. Kitchen seemed busy but still receiving poor food and service isn't cool."}
{"text":"The concierge at our hotel recommended Phuel Cafe for a late breakfast. What an amazing find! We ate there three days in a row. We were traveling as a group of six. Adults and teens. Everyone found something they enjoyed. Some of the highlights...besides the amazing owner and his chef...the omelet with gravlax, herbed goat cheese, tomato, shallot & capers, the french toast, the granola & fresh fruit, the omelet with smoked white fish and the house made lemonade. All the food was fresh, flavorful and filling. The cafe was open and airy. I loved that I could actually hear my table mates. I so, so wish we had one of these in Phoenix. Miss you Brandon!"}
{"text":"The staff was very helpful & knowledgeable in meeting the dinner needs of my daughter & me. The kale salad is incredible!  (Note that the version of the menu posted on Yelp is way out of date.)"}
{"text":"Based on service alone this place is amazing!!  The gentleman on the phone was extremely helpful and they do delivery too!!! Fantastic, can't wait for my food to arrive"}
{"text":"I was really surprised when I just saw how high the rating on this place were. Yes, the omelet was great (I got an omelet with goat cheese, spinach, and tomatoes). The size of the portions was literally laughable. It advertises for \"fruit\" with an omelet and give you one strawberry and the smallest piece of pineapple. HA, they should have just not put that on the menu. Also the size of the potato size was super small as well.   What really turned me off to this place was the service. Our waitress had an attitude and when I politely asked if I was supposed to get more fruit she stated \"you get what's on your plate\". It was incredibly rude! It was the consensus that all five of us would never recommend that restaurant to anyone. Service is key at an overpriced, organic place (at least get a good experience!) and it really didn't cut it."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Wanted a quick brunch and were so happy to find this place. Tons of options on the breakfast side, with omelets, pancakes, and yogurts. I got the eggs with potatoes and toast which were so good. The whole wheat toast was surprisingly delicious and the potatoes were seasoned perfectly. My boyfriend got the dark chocolate pancakes which were equally amazing.   The service was a little slow but I think the waitress was new.   There were definitely some more interesting \"healthier options\" but still traditional breakfast options as well. Wish I lived closer so I could go back ASAP!"}
{"text":"Lots of great vegetarian and vegan options, plus meat for carnivores. I loved the seitan Reuben; it he seitan was salty and a little crisp, and the bread was a nicely toasted rye. The side of chilled broccoli with an Asian sauce was tasty too.   However the service was slow, and the waitress, while friendly, wasn't very familiar with the menu."}
{"text":"Very tasty and the waiter was a sweetheart! I had the chicken and peanuts and the artichokes, my other half had the steak bowl and soup .... Very good and filling!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Great corner location for people watching. Fresh, non greasy breakfast. Just fantastic. Had goat cheese, tomato and spinach omelet. Home fires were bite size chunks of well cooked potatoes just like I requested. Even the ketchup is organic. No high fructose corn syrup!! That rocks. Water served in little mason jars. A nice touch. Raw sugar automatically brought for the coffee!! Pepper mills at the tables!"}
{"text":"I like that this place is in tune with the way in which  people like to eat these days. However, this place never has enough people on staff which i get because their business comes in waves. The seating is very NYC style but also annoying. They don't have a bathroom available for quick relief, one must travel to the buildings basement to use the facilities. Overall I like this cafe but some features and issues just make me want to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Found Phuel after walking all over downtown looking for a restaurant that was open. Glad I found it. Definitely an oasis of healthy food amidst a lot of uh, crap. Phuel would fit right in back home in San Francisco.  Keep rockin guys you're doing a good thing."}
{"text":"Guys this place DELIVERS BREAKFAST! Waking up on a Sunday morning to a womping temperature of 10 degrees in CLE means there's no way in hell I'm stepping foot outside. Which is why I was ecstatic when I found out this place delivers.  The food was delivered to me in the Warehouse District within 45 minutes, which is pretty reasonable considering I had a few friends over and we ordered 5 omelettes. The omelettes are damn good too. Love the goat cheese and caramelized onions (I always ask to add spinach too). Just wish they had bacon. Also you have to pay with a card if you're ordering for delivery which is no big deal, just woulda been easier to pay w/ cash since I was splitting the bill with friends."}
{"text":"The pancakes had a corn based? Instead of flour I suppose which made it taste extremely weird leaving a bad after taste. Eggs were delightful along with the potatoes. The toast tasted weird as well. The presentation is nice and the food comes quickly. It's my second time returning and I don't think I'm coming back."}
{"text":"The one positive thing is that we were sat promptly but the food we ordered, the curry bowl on special, was tasteless.  The two juices we ordered were never brought to us and we still were charged for them.  Unfortunately, this was an unpleasant experience, which is a shame for such a good location."}
{"text":"Waitress Octavia was very rude! Disappointing because otherwise a great restaurant. I am vegan and the restaurant had several vegan and vegetarian options. I had the veggie burger and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my bucket list for the past few month's based on Yelp reviews.  Not sure that my first visit was quite 4 stars, maybe 3.5.   A co-worker and I stopped here for lunch on a Tuesday afternooon.  The place was empty when we arrived, but slowly started to fill up, after we sat down.  I had previewed the menu on-line and opted for the chicken salad sandwich and side of Tabbouleh.  My co-worker ordered a salad and 1 choc chip pancake (lol!).  Our meals arrived a short time later.  My sandwich was tasty, the bun was fresh, although the chicken salad lacked just a little something, maybe some tarragon?  Just needed a little more flavor.  The tabbouleh lacked a lot of flavor, very watery, needed some lemon and a bit more seasoning.  I did however taste my co-worker's pancake and it was outstanding.  All in all, I will return to try some of the other options."}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast joint. My omelette hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great fast service. We had to go to a show at Playhouse Square and were looking for a quick and healthy meal. We loved it here! My son had the chicken salad sandwich with potatoes as a side. He loved it! I had the butternut squash soup and the grilled chicken platter. Both were delicious. Healthy, quick and good food. The staff were very attentive and friendly. I also had ginger tea that I loved."}
{"text":"Saying that this place is awesome just doesn't do it justice. Plenty of wonderful options for breakfast or lunch, and they're all healthy, too! What more could one possibly ask for!? --- Oh, and did I mention, the owner is one of the coolest folks you'll ever have the pleasure of meeting! :)"}
{"text":"The concept behind Phuel seems like it would be so good in theory, the execution just isnt there along with an extremely unprofessional owner (Brandon).  First, my CSU MBA program had used Phuel as one of our caterering options for weekly lunches. There were a few consistently good items such as the Fire Bowl, however there were many order mistakes and poorly prepared food. One such incident involving a Salmon omelette left me extremely ill the next day. During another incident the salad I ordered was incorrect, I called Phuel to ask about it, Brandon, the owner, was extremely defensive and blamed the office assistants at my college who submit our orders and denied any mistake on his part. I followed up with the office assistants in person, by explaining the issue and what Brandon relayed to me to the assistant to make sure future orders are correct, they showed me the email they sent to place the order, the order was correct as I had placed it, meaning Brandon flat out lied to me. Phuel has now lost our departments business.   At my job we often cater any meetings that happen occur over the lunch hour. I recommended Phuel to change up our usual choices, BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER. First off the orders were not as described, we received different salads than ordered, the macaroni bake didnt have a description on the website as was actually not macaroni and cheese but this spetzel mush that didnt taste very good, some of the other items that we received were so inedible that the people just threw them away, and the \"fries\" ordered were actually more like kettle chips.  I emailed the company to let them know the multiple issues we had, I told them I didnt want a refund or a remake but instead was just giving them the benefit to knowing why they lost our business. Instead of replying to the email,  Brandon looked up the order and called our executive assistant (who placed the order) and started in on his defense, she explained she did not email him and asked if he wanted to be transferred to me and he declined and emailed me instead. When I called him like he requested in the email, he \"apologized\" but then started in on all the reasons why it was our fault that we didnt understand his menu. WIth the macaroni bake he explained it was an old german recipe, ok fair enough, list it on your website and menu. He blamed the delivery company website for not including it like he asked but I told him it was not included on the Phuel website either. Also, it tasted like old crappy socks. He then told me the kettle chips, were fries and we were all wrong, I asked why no condiment or ketchup was included (standard for fries, right?) he said fries dont get ketchup at Phuel. Then I told him we received the wrong side salad and that the chicken salad sandwich was so bad the person threw it out. He kept telling me he would like to remake the order, as previously explained no one wants their food, it was gross the first time around they arent interested in a remake, we dont want a refund, I was giving him the courtesy of explaining the issues we had so they can address it. Throughout the call Brandon became increasingly defensive and hostile, raising his voice at me, talking over me and saying its not fair we wont give him a chance for a remake. No, we dont owe them any chances, we spent probably $90 on a lunch delivery that was inedible and/or incorrect.  When I asked my (hungry) co-workers if they wanted a free remake delivered, their collective response was not unless he was going to pick it up from another restaurant.   Here is my advice, clarify your \"unique\" menu difference from what is standard or would be expected by the verbatim elsewhere. Fix issues, or shut up after you apologize, you cant apologize and then rant about how the error is actually the customers comprehension of your brilliant menu..  and most of all, Brandon, GROW UP, your poor attitude and service is killing your restaurant."}
{"text":"I love going to the kind of place that embraces nutrition and flavor, especially on a mini vacation. My daughters love the build your own Boba! The breakfast choices were nice because two of us wanted something light and two wanted a hearty breakfast and there were options for all. The food was served quick and hot, the breads were wonderful and hearty. The atmosphere was beautiful, I loved the art and the service was so friendly which is nice first thing in the morning. Would definitely recommend to swing by here instead of hitting up a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went here prior to a show at Playhouse Square. I was hesitant due to the more organic menu. However, I was pleasantly full after my Portabella Reuben sandwich and Macbake as a side. Will definitely go back. Prices were good, and the food was even better!"}
{"text":"I wanted to get a semi-healthy dinner and this place was one of the few restaurants in the area that was still open so I decided to make the trek from my hotel.   I was greeted by a friendly lady who I think might be the owner. She took the time to explain what was good and even asked if I was Vegan/Vegetarian or had any dietary restrictions. I replied that I wasn't and that I honestly wouldn't survive on a Vegan diet. She recommended the Steak Fire Bowl, I was a little hesitant at first but went with it since it came with a side of Kale salad.   The Kale salad looked plain but it was very delicious because of the sweet and tangy dressing that was used. It actually made it taste good and I hate raw kale usually and only eat it because it's healthy. The steak bowl lived up to the reviews, the steak tasted tender and juicy. I expected just ok steak but this steak was gristle free, lean, cooked well, and well-seasoned. When a healthy food joint tastes just as good as food you get anywhere else and you don't feel like you are making compromises because of nutrition/calories then it's a true sign of a well-deserved 5 star review."}
{"text":"I love this place! I was just in Cleveland on a business trip and was pleasantly surprised to find this healthy little spot. We ate here 3 times in 4 days and tried a variety of things on the menu (mostly breakfast items... and green juices. All were fresh and delicious). The waitresses and staff were super sweet too."}
{"text":"Overall the food was good, but not amazing. The service system needs a lot of improvements as my specialty drink did not come out until my food had been eaten and they ran out of its ingredients and needed to make me a new drink.... So I sat after I ate  waiting on a drink I didn't originally want.  BUT that being said, my server (although hard to hear) was very nice and accommodating. Couldn't give me menu suggestions, but he seemed like the only server for 12 tables at lunch. He needed help!"}
{"text":"I came to Cleveland for a festival and a lot of places were closed because it was the winter break for CSU. Now me and my friend walked and walked for a place to eat and after finding the Starbucks we see a beacon of light from across the street, Phuel Cafe.  We walk in for food and end up with amazing conversation with the staff who appreciate theatre as much as they love the food they make and boy do they make amazing food! Absolutely everything is to die for! I had the gravlax omelet with toast and coffee on recommendation and left feeling full energized and completely satisfied unlike the various other places my friend and I have been this Festival.  Phuel goes down in the books as one of the best places I have EVER ate at in my life with the best service!"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow, but the food was pretty good. A quaint little cafe which features healthier/lighter options. My omelette was fairly standard. The potatoes were seasoned very well and the portion was huge! I tried the homemade pear jelly with my toast and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you are a vegetarian.  Everything on the menu is clearly marked whether it is vegetarian or not. If you order anything make sure you get the walnut raisin toast, it is absolutely the best.   They also offer fresh green smoothies that I haven't tried yet but I know people that say it's really good."}
{"text":"Too bad I can't give this zero stars. Horrid service.   Walked in to a server nearly running into me yelling over her shoulder \"We ain't got no tables, sit at the bar!\"  Um...ok. That's an interesting way to greet a customer. I could see at least two open tables and a table of 2 finished with their food, likely to leave in the next 5 minutes. I stood there for another minute only to be approached by a other employee who told us to sit at the bar and then walked away. Still was not sure where the bar was at this point either.   It was about 11:30am on a Saturday and not terribly busy either.   At this point, I just left. Awful awful awful customer service.    Note to the owner: Please fire your wait staff."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more than I did.  I ordered the macaroni bake, or something to that extent, and it was more of a mushy curried dish.  It tasted fine, but was completely different than I'd expected.  My sweet potato fries were tasty. I can't remember what my husband ordered, but he was underwhelmed as well.  We also had the brownie, which was ok, a little bitter in my opinion.  I would try it again but get something off the breakfast menu instead.  I saw some other meals that looked delicious - I think I just picked the wrong stuff.  The restaurant was packed so I think Phuel has more to offer."}
{"text":"Solid 4, if not just for the free check in cookie/coffee :). Every time I come here the food taste great and super fresh. Location is awesome but not super parking friendly. The water is super fresh(I know, really weird to get excited about) and the amount of fresh juice blends and smoothies is awesome!!  There are healthy options and less healthy options but still tastes amazing!! The only reason I knock down one star is that sometimes the service isn't super efficient and the wait on food but def worth it for an early brunch or when the restaurant isn't busy!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was amazing! Tons of fresh veggies you don't normally get at a bfast joint! Had green smoothie and that was on point as well! A very yummy and healthy spot! Can't wait to try it for lunch!"}
{"text":"What to say about Phuel?? It is an amazing place with amazing staff! Even thought this place focuses on healthy and vegetarian foods, there are still great meat options for those who like their meat. Everything I have had here is delicious, and they are constantly featuring special entrees too! I can't talk enough about the awesome food here. Hands down, this place has the best Greek salad I have ever had. they put just the right amount of their home made dressing on the salad, which is major to me. Normally, I ask for the dressing on the side because the salad is usually soaked in dressing at other places. However, Phuel is always perfect.  Another huge plus for me is the staff. The staff is great here. The servers and kitchen staff are genuinely friendly, which makes me feel welcome here. Lastly, the owner Brandon, is an awesome guy. He is astoundingly friendly and passionate about his restaurant. My fiancé and I love coming here."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place coming back from Tower City and were so happy we did. Unbelievable food, vibe, and people.  My girlfriend and I ordered the spicy chicken with peanuts, szechuan bean curd, and two kale salad sides. I'm normally not a huge fan of kale but Phuel's is a must-try. Both of the entrees had healthy protein portions, lots of fresh veggies, and great seasoning. My only critique would be they could be a bit spicier but they will be spot on for the typical Midwestern spice palate.  Phuel's entire menu is easy to pore over and they make eating healthy (and tasty) a breeze! Highly highly recommend. Wonderful new addition to a cool neighborhood.  Brandon the manager / owner is awesome and extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, healthy eating, and Cleveland in general. He mentioned they are working on adding an outdoor patio! In addition, you can pre-order food online or do delivery, meaning you have no excuse not to try Phuel. I can promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place! Delicious food , fast delivery and vegan friendly ! Best portobello mushroom I have had too date!!!"}
{"text":"Wow not edible food Chocolate chip pancake looks  like they threw in a few chocolate chips on top of the pancake. Two pieces of fruit. Potatoes- not edible!!!"}
{"text":"Small, modern cafe' focusing on nutrition, plant centered eating and locally sourced foods. We went around brunch time on a Saturday morning and had the place to ourselves most of our visit which I didn't mind at all. Our server and all the staff were exceptionally friendly and accommodating.  We split a Steak and Egg Breakfast Bowl, Pancakes with local Ohio syrup and a Ginger Get Well fresh pressed juice. The juice was topped with fresh nutmeg which was a delicious touch. They also had local grass fed burgers, vegan burgers, smoothies and other lunch options. The menu has vegetarian, vegan and gf labels. They have grab and go snacks at the front including fresh fruit, salads, homemade baked goods, fresh brewed teas and kombucha. There was even a box of fresh squash sitting in the front as if it was just delivered from a local farmer. The prices and portions are on point and I would see myself frequenting here or ordering out often as a local.  They offer dine in or carry out services with online ordering. They will also soon be offering nutritional and cooking demonstrations for local patrons to educate themselves better on the importance of wholesome eating which is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Service was super friendly and extremely helpful. Great place to eat before going to the theatre. Healthy AND affordable! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ordered a Korean Beef Stir Fry over Rice - almost inedible. The meat was low quality, pre-cooked and dry as the Sahara. For $12 for a small container I expect a lot more. I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, well priced. Online ordering is extremely convenient if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Stopped in randomly. Not sure if you're supposed to call to make reservations but the wait around lunch time is inevitable. Super fast service, good food. Sort of a small place but overall cute."}
{"text":"I had Pheul for the first time today while judging a scholastic contest at CIA today. Since they were providing lunch, I didn't what to expect (but it's Cleveland, and we have amazing food, so I wasn't stressed)  I was very impressed with their chicken salad sandwich as well as the amazing kale salad. I don't think I've ever eaten kale cold before but this salad had some citrus as well as something sweet in it. I would eat it again in a heartbeat! I will be going back to Pheul very soon :)"}
{"text":"I admire and respect restaurants that try to promote healthy eating, so it really pains me to have to write this review.  We had a gravlax (smoked salmon) omelet with onions, mushrooms and goat cheese, and a blueberry pancake.  The blueberry pancake - burnt, and very greasy for a place that is supposed to be healthy.  The omelet - not bad, but also quite greasy, and the ingredients were not homogenous, so more than once I found myself eating a big wad of goat cheese.  And the onions were burnt.  Unfortunately, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch just before seeing a show at playhouse. The food is pretty good and healthy. Service was a bit weird though as they seemed very confused."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. We randomly found this place on Yelp and decided to make the hike from Public Square to east 13th and give it a shot for a Friday lunch.   We pre-ordered our food and started walking as soon as we hung up the phone with them. When we got there, a smiling staff greeted us as our food was being packaged. While there, we chatted with the employees who had a lot of insights to offer about their food, the specials and the amazing juices / smoothies they offer. We ordered the Green Smoothie which was absolutely fantastic! Fresh, rich and tasty, but left you feeling extremely healthy.  I had the Gravlax sandwich with a side of \"fries\" and even after the long trek back to the office, the bread was still perfectly toasted and the salmon was fresh and fantastically refreshing.  The fries were hand sliced small potatoes baked perfectly in the oven and tasted like something you would make at home, if you were a fantastic cook!  All in all, Phuel Cafe delivers on Grubhub and while we wanted to check it out ourselves for the first time, we will absolutely be ordering this in the future. Out of the 5 people that ordered, every single person loved it.  Great new business in a buzzing neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Found the menu for PHuel in our apt building and was pleasantly surprised at the gluten free options available. Eating downtown is challenging with food allergies and this place is great. I could eat here everyday!! Good quality, portions and flavor. Not to mention the knowledge of the staff on the ingredients is awesome. I love the easy set up for take out with a separate layout for dine in."}
{"text":"I've been twice now, which was enough to land this on my regular lunch circuit. Everything is fresh and pretty healthy, so I can reliably choose something that won't make me feel gross for the rest of the day. They're doing some unique dishes, too, such as a cold wild rice salad with oranges and pistachios. It may need a little fine tuning- today's summer salad was delicious, but the dressing lacked zing- but I'll be a regular."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite vegetarian spot in downtown!  The Seitan Rueben is unlike any vegetarian substitute I've ever tried. I really love the diversity of vegetarian options and how healthy and fresh everything is"}
{"text":"I had long overlooked Phuel Cafe. For some reason, from the outside I assumed it was just a coffee shop. Surprise! It's not. Phuel's menu is extensive and the fact that they serve breakfast all day is a huge plus. So many vegan/vegetarian options too!  I got the three side meal with the kale salad, orange pistachio rice, and Asian chilled broccoli. The kale and rice were great, but the broccoli fell a little short. The flavor was great, but there were a lot of stalks. A lot. Overall, it was a moderate value too. A pretty dense amount of food for $10 or so.  Food being great, where Phuel fell short was service. I tried to call in a carry out lunch order but the phone was busy for 40 minutes as I kept trying. No big deal. Downtown lunch is busy, I get it. I walked over from my office to put in an order at the counter. The carry-out counter is on a separate side of the restaurant that is open to the kitchen and it was not a pretty scene. What appeared to be the manager was loudly berating a line cook the entire time I was waiting for my food (about 15-20 minutes). It was extremely uncomfortable. The whole experience left a weird taste in my mouth, even though the food was awesome."}
{"text":"The manager is the nicest person ever, he really makes the whole atmosphere of the restaurant. It has a great view or the chandelier and great food that makes you feel good about yourself. Give the peanut butter chocolate chip cookies a try but ask for just the cookie dough, he'll know exactly what you're talking about! :)"}
{"text":"I just love this place:) whenever I come from California to Cleveland this is my first stop :)"}
{"text":"Ive been going here for breakfast for the past 5 months and It's usually very good. Food is cooked to order and very filling. Sometimes you may get a tuff cut of steak which is annoying. But other than that food is great. The service is alway A+ and make you feel welcome and not rushed. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on our first trip to downtown Cleveland. Our waitress seemed hesitant about even letting us sit down, and once we were seated she ignored us for at least 6 minutes, not saying anything while walking past us several times (this is a small restaurant) we had to ask for water, and the food was just okay! Won't be back probably"}
{"text":"This place is a must every time I visit Cleveland. I absolutely adore the smoothies they have. Phuel is located in the absolutely beautiful Cleveland theatre district, right across from Playhouse Square. One of the great things about this place is it's all organic, fresh, and high quality. Don't expect your food deep fried... it doesn't happen here. Both times I've been here I've ate breakfast. I've ordered the pancakes and french toast... both were very good. I'll be returning to Cleveland again in February and I'll post an updated review then, although I'm sure it'll be just as good."}
{"text":"This place seems to be a gem. They have a beautiful healthy menu including delicious fresh juices. The food we had was really rich and delicious. It tasted like thanksgiving. FYI on show nights they are super busy and have a limited menu. Great fast service tho."}
{"text":"Phuel Cafe is located in the world renowned Cleveland theater district.  It is a small cafe that offers healthier plant based options for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  They open at 6:30 am weekdays and 9:00 am weekends.  They do offer delivery to all places downtown and some other surrounding areas.  My co worker and I decided on our carpool day that we would place an order and pick it up on our way to work.  The order was ready at the exact time promised and everything was correct.  I have also dined in at the cafe on a couple occasions and again customer service was stellar.  Note:  The owner is really nice and seems to be very hands on.  More than willing to answer questions and accommodate.  Now for the MAIN EVENT......the food.  Just about everything is made in house or locally purchased.  The pancakes are large and taste delicious.  The spinach, tomato and mushroom omelet was a huge with whole mushrooms throughout....Yes PLEASE!  IF you love yourself you will get the walnut raisin toast.  There is something magical almost orgasmic about this toast.  You will have only one regret.....that you have waited so long to try it.   Tip:  When you check in on Yelp you get your choice of an iced coffee or a cookie.......GET the COOKIE!!!"}
{"text":"I tried the Phuel seitan Reuben, and the white asparagus+cauliflower tater tots.  The sandwich was quite good and the tots were a bit too soft but still had a good flavor.  I should note the waiter was kind and did a decent job, but the biggest issue was I waited 40 minutes from being seated until my food arrived.  I could only see six tables full and there were two people working on the waitstaff.  Kind waiters and pretty good vegan or near vegan food will probably bring me back for a second visit. (Later that day...)  I should have added this at the time, but I ended up stuck in a restroom downtown getting incredibly sick the day of this review.  I learned later they failed to note some items in their food that I might have had an allergic reaction to, and in fact lost consciousness while in a toilet stall. I was worried I had issues with seitan, but have tried it since in other foods and have been fine."}
{"text":"Phuel Cafe is the PERFECT breakfast spot in downtown Cleveland that serves a variety of breakfast and lunch options all while being health oriented.  Its location in the middle of Playhouse Square makes it easily accessible from many areas of downtown.   I was told all of their food, sauces and drinks are either made in house or out sourced locally.  This makes everything super fresh and does not leave you with that over stuffed feeling you get after eating tons of processed foods.  There was so much I wanted to try after reading through the menu but i went with the yogurt served with granola and fresh fruit.  The granola made the whole dish.  It was crunchy and really flavorful. Since I couldn't decide between what kind of bread I wanted I went with a cranberry walnut muffin their walnut raisin toast.  Both were delicious and fresh baked but highly recommend their walnut raisin toast.  It might have been some of the best toast I have tried.    I can not wait to return to try some of their smoothies, pancakes, french toast and lunch choices.   Phuel does exactly what it claims, fills you up for a great price and not a lot of calories!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed by this place! When we arrived we had been on the road for 8 hours, so weary travelers is an understatement. We were welcomed cheerfully and seated immediately. My brother and his girlfriend took us here and they had just been in earlier for lunch so they knew our server well! The menu accommodated my vegan and gluten free dietary needs. I ordered the Power Veggie Burger on a bed of greens, which ended up being cooked spinach, since they did not serve a gf bun. My order came with a bun by mistake but they took it back quickly and remade the dish for me. The side was delicious organic roasted potatoes. I also had to try the vegan milkshake and was pleasantly surprised to taste cacao powder in it instead of the typical cocoa that is chock-full of sugar. It also had in it \"soy cubes\" which I imagine must mean tofu, and avocado! I was afraid the avocado would make the leftovers taste bad the next day, but I kept the 1/3 of it I did not drink that night in the fridge and it tasted exactly the same the next morning. My husband ordered a dish with chicken peppers and rice he says was \"pretty good.\" The reason for four stars is that there was no children's menu so our kids had a hard time getting something nutritious to eat. The cook himself came out to talk to them and offered them two choices: chicken fingers or chocolate chip pancakes. Of course they chose the cake! So they had dessert for dinner. I was too exhausted to argue with them. They made it halfway through their giant plates of pancakes before giving in to what I can only imagine must have been sugar overdose. If I'm ever in Cleveland again I would revisit, but probably get the kids food somewhere else."}
{"text":"A coworker and I walked down to the Phuel Cafe on Chester Avenue just to find that they were actually closed... which was contrary to the sign on their door. Very disappointing. I've never been and would love to try it but there must be different owners or Something odd going on that caused them to be closed today without notice."}
{"text":"I was finally able to try out Pheul today! The staff was very welcoming and went over the menu as well as their motto eat,learn, be happy....with me. I decided to try the omelet with smoked white fish, lemon, goat cheese and shallots with whole wheat toast. DELICIOUS superb I will be back I highly recommended this fine establishment!"}
{"text":"There's something magical about eating healthy, wholesome food while watching the busy city-scape go about it's Monday morning. There's a reason it's name is Phuel; you really feel energized afterwards! Friendly, cool staff and cheap, healthy fuel for the day. You can't beat that, which is why this is my new favorite spot downtown. Try a smoothie and a huge breakfast sandwich. It will run you around $10. They have to-go as well!"}
{"text":"Great service! Food was not very good though. I had the yogurt and granola and it was 80% stale granola, 10% fruit and 10% yogurt. I had to ask for extra yogurt and even when I did, I ended up eating my husband's food because the granola was just too stale. The service was great though!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled on this cafe about six months ago when we were apartment hunting downtown and fell in love. The local farm fresh and organic aspect caught our eye first but their AMAZING food kept us coming back. Since we've moved from NY to Cleveland 4 months ago, this has been our go to spot. We just had brunch there this morning! Delicious walnut dark chocolate banana pancakes and eggs with walnut raisin toast and homefries. I just can't get enough. We also love the lunch and dinner menu. The peanut chicken dish is my favorite! Their takeout option is fantastic too.   We strongly recommend Phuel and will be taking our out of town guests here for breakfast next weekend."}
{"text":"The store manager and partner Brandon is freaking amazing. This guy was so friendly to explain the menu and all the hot picks. The food choices are great if you like to eat healthy. I can't wait to eat here for the rest of our trip here! Love this place. Great location as well. Right across the street is the university, playhouse square and Ohio theater. Definitely a 5 star at this joint."}
{"text":"Expensive, small portions, overcooked entrees, and all the flavors are the same- salty.  We ordered three different dishes and they were all the same taste- salty."}
{"text":"Wow. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time to go here. My boyfriend and I walked in and were told by a passing waitress \"I ain't got no seats in here. You can sit at the bar.\" She didn't even look up at us as she walked by. We waited for a moment and another waitress walked by and said we could sit at the bar. We asked if we could wait for a table and the rude waitress didn't even look at us while she told the other waitress somethings about other people staying to eat their food. There were at least 3 tables that we could see that were open. I have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant before."}
{"text":"We ordered lunch from here today. It was a large variety of some of their unique food combinations. I had the grilled eggplant some vegetable bean soup and Kale aid. I've never heard of Kale aid before but it's not bad. I had to get a water to chase it.   Tasty lunch and I hear breakfast is really good here. Check this place out if you are in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast and wasn't impressed. I have walked by it multiple times and thought it would be a great options with their health conscious focus. I was simple and had the fruit plate with and iced coffee, an easy order. I was in a little bit of a rush (as I told the waitress) and it took a good 10 minutes for anything to come out to me. When my fruit arrived, though it was pretty there wasn't much to it. Maybe two slices of banana, a strawberry and a full slice of orange. That was it. Not worth my $5 and I would have much rather have spent that on a fruit salad down the street at the grocery store. The iced coffee was good, nothing out of the ordinary.  The service was not that great. The waitress took my order from across the restaurant and anytime I asked for something there was no acknowledgement that she heard me. I paid with cash, since I was in a rush and before getting my change the waitress cleaned two other tables (the place was completely empty, just me) before even taking my check to the register. After she assumed the change was hers, I was a little annoyed but left her with it anyway since I had to be somewhere.   Maybe I will try again, but probably not. Their menu, especially their drinks, looked great but the first impression was not positive."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed. I really wanted to like this place. Maybe I'll have to try breakfast, but my lunch entree was not good.   I got a Phuel Plate: Buckwheat noodles with salmon and veg. The flavor was good. The veg (celery, red pepper and onions) were good and the noodles were good and served in an appropriate quantity.   However the salmon was horrible. It was dry. It was tasteless; it definitely tasted nothing like salmon. It looked like cubed chicken. I doubt if it was fresh at any recent point. How hard would it be to put a fresh filet on top?   For the side that is included I got sweet potato fries. These were fine. Whole meal with side was $10.   I really did like that you can order online for pick up or delivery and pay online. My pick up order was ready at the estimated time and I was in and out within seconds when I went to get it. The workers were friendly and read my order back to me before handing it to me. The place was not busy at 12:15p on a Thursday."}
{"text":"Really yummy!  Breakfast all day, so I had an omelette for lunch. Lotsa veggie filling (mushrooms, tomatoes, and spinach). Fast, friendly service. The coffee was just so-so, but everything else was great!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant offering a variety of tasteful and fresh vegetarian and non vegetarian foods. I had the kale and pinto bean soup, the chicken salad sandwich , steak tacos, sweet potato and black bean tacos,  sweet potato fries, broccoli a blonde brownie and a chocolate chip muffin. I actually shared this with my friend. :) The restaurant was very clean and the prices are very reasonable. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very clean and modern restaurant. The food is good but a little flavorless (although very healthy) and the staff is friendly. I've been here for lunch on several occasions and enjoy it."}
{"text":"The owners are very kind people who genuinely care about their business and customers.  I travel all around the US and really appreciated their great service.  Even when the cafe is jam packed they hustle and work very hard to make things right, every experience a good experience for their customers.  I honestly found their food to be underpriced...I paid $5 for the tofu scramble and in my hometown of Anchorage, AK I would pay around $12-15 for the amount of food."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it got good reviews and it's a short walk from my apartment. Sadly, this place was a huge disappointment both on service and on food. I went there with my wife on a Saturday a little before noon. There were only 2 other couples in the main seating area. It was not busy. I ordered the steak fire bowl and my wife ordered the veggie burger. The food took almost 30 mins to arrive. When it finally came, my steak was cold, chewy, and tasteless. Not spicy at all and lacked any taste for that matter. My wife's veggie burger was bland. The fried potatoes were decent, I will give them that but not good enough to make up for the rest of the food that was poor tasting, and the poor service. I will hesitate to return."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you visit, and then afterwards want to tell the first five people you see about it. I actually didn't expect to like this place that much since I'm not much of a health food junkie (I'm more of a fried chicken and biscuits gal) but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate a well crafted salad once in a while.   First thing- this place is on Playhouse Square, which is great if you're in the area anyways, but if you're driving her with the express purpose of grabbing a quick lunch, parking will most definitely be an issue, so factor that in your plans.   First impression- the restaurant is split into a \"take out\" side with a small window bar for waiting, and an eat in/ dining side, which is really tastefully decorated, and because it's on the corner across from Starbucks, it has a lovely view of Playhouse Square and the new(ish) chandelier.   I was greeted immediately by a girl, even though it was past the typical lunch hour, around 2:30pm. She showed me the menu, and I asked her for some recommendations which she kindly shared with me, but she didn't hover waiting for me to order which I appreciated, especially considering I was the only one in the restaurant at that time. I think the thing that impressed me the most is the sheer diversity of options on their menu. They serve breakfast all day long (and being the breakfast lover that I am, I was really tempted to go with this option) but I ended up choosing one of their specials written on the blackboard nearby. I ordered a black bean burger with oven baked fries, along with one of their \"ginger get well\" drinks. If you're at all a ginger lover like myself, you will LOVE the ginger get well drink- it's not overly spicy like a lot of ginger beers, but still really flavorful and served cold and frothy almost like a smoothie, but not as thick.   The black bean burger was homeade, which made me really happy since many times when you order a black bean burger in a restaurant, you get one of those Morning Star patties and then ask yourself why you couldn't have just made yourself that at home. But their black bean burger was clearly made in house- served on a multigrain bun with sprouts and tomatoes. The oven baked \"fries\" that came with it were really crispy and not oily at all.   Most of all, the girl serving me was an absolute sweetheart! I was really impressed at the quality of service I received, as well as the value of my meal. I would say this place's prices are comparable to Panera bread, but much better quality ingredients and way better experience obviously.   I can't wait to recommend this place to my  vegetarian friends, and even those that aren't vegetarian or even health conscious would enjoy this place in my opinion. I'm eager to go back when I have the chance to try out more things on their menu, and experience Phuel cafe all over again!"}
