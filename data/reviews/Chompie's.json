{"text":"Food great. Service horribly. Not enough staff to handle a small amount of customer. Had to wait forever for each step of the process. Be prepared to have to shave again during the meal"}
{"text":"Always great food.great service top notch place everytime every plate!!! The bakery is the bomb  fresh super tasty and priced right"}
{"text":"Good stuff, try the Jewish sliders:). Be ready for a long wait at lunch time."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Caesar salad was pretty typical, although it did come with two large asiago breadsticks that were yummy, and was huge for only $5.99. Lou's Phoenician was good but the amount of meat was kind of absurd...  I took off more than half of it. 'double bakes bread' does not mean it is baked before served. The bread was cold. The coleslaw was the kind that is slightly sweet. Fries were bomb.com ...wedge style :) Pastries were also reallllly good."}
{"text":"This place has basically anything you want-I especially love their challah and pastries. This visit I got the chefs soup of the day, lentil-it was very salty but I still enjoyed it. Warning: it was also scalding hot and I had to wait a while before attempting to eat it (and I still burnt my tongue). The Caesar salad was kinda lame and had too much dressing...should have asked for it on the side. I've never truly enjoyed salad here and hated a sandwich I got one time (it was cold/dry and had wayyyyy too much meat stuffed into it).., but their breakfast omelets, bagels, challah bread, and pastries are kick ass."}
{"text":"Yum! Went here today and it was great. Had monte cristo. Very clean, service is great, food came quick. They have food for everyone the menus is big. Only con is it may be a little pricey but worth it,"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. 
We went for the customer appreciation day. It's just another over priced, no flavor, place. I was extremely disappointed.  You couldn't even pay me to go back there.
The one great thing-- the employees were very nice."}
{"text":"Yo, my dude keane has got the bomb service. Ask for him.  Was a fan of the jewish slider.  Soup was on point, would def recommend"}
{"text":"Rude unhelpful woman who seats people. I questioned whether to not even bother, but I had a hungry family so I went and got husband & kids from the car and came back to give her a 2nd try at seating us politely! She failed......we left!!! 
Rude ~ Rude ~ Rude!!!!!! 
The place was empty so there was no excuse to be so rude & unaccommodating! No desire to go back if that's how the staff treat their patrons!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy!! Is my first time here and I LOVE IT!!! The service is excellent and the bathrooms are clean and its conveniently located in the mall!!"}
{"text":"Dirtiest place I have ever been in wait staff could care less if you were there walked out never to return"}
{"text":"I got the classic Jewish Sliders which are apparently the go-to meal when you go to Chompies.   They were pretty darn good except the potato pancakes were a little too thick for my taste.  The roast beef unbelievably moist and tender though.  Everything in the bakery looked mouth-wateringly delicious.  I got the black and white cookie baked right on the premises and it certainly delivered.  Too bad I was only in town for a few days or else I would come back to try more things."}
{"text":"This was my first time here had read reviews and was really excited. I was very disappointed. Tried there mile high Hot pastrami not hot at all. Ask the waitress who was super annoying why the sandwich was cold if it started it was a hot pastrami sandwich. She replied it wasn't supposed to be hot.  Wierd???!!!!! Wont be back. Plus we literally had to wait over 45 minutes for cold sandwich"}
{"text":"Chompies has a cross between New York food with traditional Jewish meals to make another great restaurant in Arizona. The potato pancakes are delightful for everyone!"}
{"text":"Way over priced sandwich! The normal size for a double price. Good enough to pay double? NO! Never going back there."}
{"text":"I watch Adam on \"Man VS Food\" and just everything he tried so yummy so I was more than pleased to see he tried this place. I'm a sucker for how they describe items on the menu and ended up trying a few dishes. I've never tried a kosher deli but it didn't hurt to try. I don't eat pork and they had a few other options unlike most breakfast places that don't have any other options of meat or no meat. The French toast was out this world...absolutely mind blown! Salmon dish I opted for was alright, too many capers do take away from the dish and gives it an overpowering taste unlike a subtle one. Will have to try other dishes on next trip!"}
{"text":"I came to this place for a business late breakfast and meeting.  The food delivery was timely and the attendant helpful.  Breakfast was good. overall good experience. It did what I hoped it would do."}
{"text":"This is not my first time here at this location.  Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's bad.  For service, I give this location a 2.  We sat down right away.  It took about 10 minutes to get a drink order which one of the hostesses had to take because our waiter was too busy to take it.  When he finally came over to our table, the hostess was taking our order for our waiter, he started taking my husband's order.  They had to combine their notes to get the order straight.  It took about 30 minutes to get our sandwiches.  I had a 1/2 tongue sandwich.  The meat was  not just soft, it was gushy.  I also order a potato kanish, it was grumbling as I was eating it. It should have been soft. My husband loved his corned beef 1/2 sandwich. I guess that was the highlight of the evening.

We paid for our food and went to the bakery and had to wait 5 minutes for the guy at the counter to get our order for bagels and black and whites.  He actually was very nice and gave us a bag and put my leftovers from dinner and my black and whites into a bag for me. Actually this was the highlight of my evening.  

Chompies as a whole is going down in quality lately no matter what location you go to.  This is still the best location that I ever went to and I've been to Tempe, Scottsdale and this one. With the hit and misses that I have experience, I wouldn't go to any other one."}
{"text":"I usually love Chompie's, not today.. Service was bad, food was cold, when I order a HOT pastrami I like it HOT.. Fry's were cold too.. Had an appointment to get to or I would have had them warm my meal but the server was hard to track down and when she ask me how my meal was I told her it was not very hot and she told me its just suppose to be warm... Really this was not my first Hot Pastrami here... I don't like to complain but every thing about my $13.00 HALF  sandwich meal was terrible including the service...."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this restaurant but was very disappointed. The food was ok. Not great. But it wS the service that surprised us. When we arrived the tables around us were full. Slowly people left and the dirty dishes were left on the tables. The wIt staff didn't lift a finger to clear the tables. Really unappetizing. Our waitress never came over to check on us. She just stood around talking with a friend. I spoke to the manager and asked why the wait staff left dirty dishes unattended and was told it wasn't their job. When I left, the tables still hadn't been cleared. Speaking with the manager was ineffective. I will never return."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch and the food was fantastic! One complaint though, service was very slow. I learned my lesson not to try to make it in and out during a 1 hour lunch break. When I have some time to relax and eat an excessive amount of knish, I will be back."}
{"text":"Always a treat.  So many pastries to choose from.  Tthe best pastrami in town.  And don't forget the fresh pickles!"}
{"text":"This was my first and last visit to Chompie's. 
The food was pretty good...I had the Monte Christo. Our waitress was nice and the service was good. 
BUT, our booth smelled like stinky feet. I kept getting whiffs of the foot funk and thought it was my imagination. I finally mentioned it to my husband and he smelled it too. Picturing all the sweaty asses that sat on that booth before me was enough for me to never, ever return. And to think, I used to hate the managers who made me wipe down the booths back in the day when I waitressed in college to support my  drinking habit."}
{"text":"I am writing for this particular location, other Chompie's have been great. I have been to this location a few times and have never been impressed with the staff but this last time I had a server that was such a little s#$! with her bad attitude, I will never return. She was rude to the people at the table who ordered water, was awkwardly telling us it was \"weird\" that we liked our appetizer because others didn't, and explained that even though they advertise \"rare\" roast beef, it all depends on the cut...what??? Last straw!"}
{"text":"So So is the best I can give it. My corned beef sandwich was dry and the bread fell apart. When I brought it to the managers attention the response I got was that they knew about it.  Poor response!!  Not sure I will return."}
{"text":"Chicken noodle soup...In a quart size container full of chicken broth, there was two inches of noodles in the bottom of container, six pieces of carrots, a couple pieces of celery and NO chicken for $7.99.  Look at your take out orders before leaving."}
{"text":"Holy cow!! Awesome! Big place and big menu. Absolutely delighted with our lunch! Do not pass up the bakery, it's huge! So much to choose from.."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal. Whenever we family from out of town Chompies is a must visit!

The Original Jewish Sliders are amazing! Not in the mood? No problem, the corned beef sandwich and Matzo Ball soup will hit the spot! Don't forget to grab a black and white cookie on the way out the door!!"}
{"text":"I'd probably give this place 3.5 stars, so for the sake of yelp, I'll round up.  They have a nice big menu with tons to choose from for any meal of the day.  While I've enjoyed the food and have had friendly service, I'm just not excited about the place.  The pastry display at the front of the store is beautiful and definitely piques your interest, but I'd say it's 1/3-1/2 full of butter cookies and while butter cookies are good, how excited can you get about them?  The prices are a little high, but then kids eat free on Tuesday."}
{"text":"The breakfast items are a little bland, i.e. bagel sandwiches and breakfast burritos. This place is always busy though, so I assume the rest of the items on the menu are really good. Staff is nice, if a little slow sometimes."}
{"text":"Sorry, but as an ex-New Yorker, I find Chompies very disappointing. And every time I try it it seems to have bygone a little downhill. I know it's an institution, and I'm sorry I missed it's heyday."}
{"text":"Chompies changed their corned beef a while back. It's not the same quality and flavor. Scott's and Goldman's corned beef is superior . We  used to be regulars, now we are occasionals"}
{"text":"Three stars only because of the price of the food. Everything seemed to be a little more expensive than the food should be. Food was good and I go there for bagels every now and again. But I don't think I'll be back for dinner any time soon."}
{"text":"There are (at least) two items on the menu that pass the test at Chompie's ~ the corned beef sandwich and the matzo ball soup. They are both worth the visit, although your waistline may not thank you. I get the half corned beef with a side of the soup, and I'm in Jewish heaven. Although several folks have mistaken me for Jewish, I am unfortunately just a boring Gentile. However, my Jersey roots appreciate Chompie's.

HELPFUL HINT: If it's not a traditional Jewish food, don't bother ordering it at Chompie's. Their menu is full of \"American\" food items that they don't execute very well, not surprisingly. They need to trim down the menu by 2 pages!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped for lunch at this deli.  We had a cup of matazbal soup and one half reuben sandwich.  Both were excellent.  Also added was cole slaw and their famous pickles.  AMY was our server and she was excellent.  I will be back for more good food."}
{"text":"As close to a real, east coast deli as you'll find west of the Appalachians. Delicious sandwiches, egg creams, etc. Pricy, but kids apparently eat free in summer, so we kept it at 5 stars."}
{"text":"I got the breakfast sliders.
Didn't care for the turkey sausage.
I'm not a hippie.
Difficult to eat. 
Bloody Mary was okay.
Pancakes are good.
Eggs are fake.
Service was good."}
{"text":"Good deli with a broad array of NY style deli meats and pastries.  I ate here a couple of times and would do so again.  

The flavors are a bit off from what you would find in a traditional Jewish deli (I grew up in Brooklyn) but very good and better than a lot of the so called traditional delis in Chicago.  

Definitely worth a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"We are regulars here and we love it. The only place that has great sandwiches and bagels. We love our regular server Ashley, we usually sit at the bar area in the morning and she serves us, always remembers our order and is so nice and friendly. We not only come here for the food but to see her as well. Great service very happy with this place."}
{"text":"I've gone to Chompie's for years and have been coming to the Chandler location for about three years now. The food is usually pretty good. The service is really hit-or-miss, but I guess that can be expected from a lot of restaurants. My dad was in town on Memorial Day and wanted a skillet, so I suggested we go to Chompie's because their food is pretty good. 

The first odd thing that happened is the hostess telling us \"_____ will be your server, and he's REALLY great.\" We were all a bit confused by that because we'd never heard a hostess brag about the server before. Anyway. The server comes up to us and we tell him we're ready to order. He tells us that he can only take our drink order right now and he's going to take the order of the table behind us. We order our iced teas and he tells us, \"Just so you know, guys, we've got a lot of people it's pretty busy here today, okay?\" Despite there being empty tables around us, we went with it. Ten minutes later our drinks come out and we order the food, and again, he tells us \"It's going to be a while because we're super busy, but I'll be sure to keep your drinks refilled.\" Sure, okay. Within 10 minutes we all had empty glasses. We watched him walk right by our table at least five times--one of the times he even bumped into me and apologized! I thought for sure that would get his attention but I guess not. Ten more minutes pass and as he walks by I try to get his attention for more tea, but I'm ignored. About forty minutes after we ordered the table behind us gets their food (the ones he had to help before taking our order). We wait fifteen minutes (still no refills) until someone else runs our food out to us, and it's ice cold. By this point we'd realized the hostess was probably playing a sick joke on us because she knew he was the worst sever ever.

Anyway, we're waiting for him to come to our table so we can pay for the drinks and leave, but he ignores us some more. He's standing at the table behind us and the guests ask how he's doing today, and he proceeds to complaint to them about how miserable he is to be working and how people are pissing him off. Then he walks right past us again and goes to the kitchen. At this point we just told the manager and left, who didn't even ask us to pay for the iced teas. I don't know why they'd let someone with such a horrible attitude even be on the floor. That experience really killed it for me and I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Best Jewish deli and bakery in town. Awesome staff, amazing food and out of control baked goods. We try to go to Chompies' at least once a weekend for breakfast. My favorite is the All American with a Poinsettia (champaign and cranberry) to drink."}
{"text":"Chompie's has a nice atmosphere.  We went for brunch, and we ate outside. I ordered the blueberry pancakes and a side of eggs and sausage. The pancakes are huge and could be their own meal. I did not want to eat only pancakes so I ordered a side of eggs and sausage.  They don't have a meal with the flavored pancakes and eggs.  It was very good. 

My friend had the two eggs and a side of potato pancakes. She loved it and kept saying they have the best potato pancakes.  While I didn't try it, she is a regular and loves their potato pancakes. 

Our server was very friendly, and took care of us.  She could have checked on a little more, but over all it was a very good experience."}
{"text":"Great deli and restaurant. 

Everything I have ever gotten here for breakfast I have loved especially their huevos rancheros and bagel breakfast sandwiches.

Their lunch salads and sandwiches are also delicious.

Would recommend to anyone in the Scottsdale area.

Portions are very big and service is always good."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches (check out man v. food); try the jewish and western sliders...They are awesome.

Other items that I've tried are so-so, but try the specials."}
{"text":"I usually love Chompie's. Granted, I typically visit the one in Tempe, but in my previous experiences, they've all been pretty consistent. Today, I ordered Chompie's Benedict. Poached eggs are always hit or miss at casual places, but I'd ordered this before with success at the north Scottsdale location. The plate came out sloppy, but that's not really worth mentioning. The problem was that one of my poached eggs was raw. Of course a poached egg has a runny yolk but runny whites? Nope. Not eating that. I sent it back and the manager came out to argue with me that sometimes poached eggs have runny whites and that's just how they cook them. Well, why was one of them ok and the other was a blister sitting on a piece of ham? She eventually only charged me for the egg I did eat, which is fine, but why argue with me for not wanting to eat a raw egg?

TLDR: Not going back to the Chandler Chompie's. Tempe and Scottsdale are still ok."}
{"text":"Everyone seems to love Chompie's but I am not there yet.  I haven't really enjoyed the baked goods.  The food was okay but the prices are too high for what it is.  I've had better but I do have to say that they provide Challah bread to most places in the valley and even the the price is high I need my challah bread for french toast!"}
{"text":"I've purchased Chompie's low carb bread
For years and enjoy the quality and taste. I was surprised to see the long vacant old Miracle Mile deli location at Arrowhead Mall opened as a Chompie's New York Deli. The one thing we need in this west valley neighborhood is a good New York style deli that also serves breakfast. I decided to try their breakfast menu. They open at 7:00AM so I got in early and ordered the Biltmore Benedict $14.99. It's two poached eggs, grilled slice Nova Lox, sautéed red onions, tomato, topped with Havarti cheese all floating on a toasted bialy (a bagel with a fork tender lighter fluffier dough) with a choice of home fries, potato latke, or fresh fruit. 
My order arrived promptly. The poached eggs were firm with a lose warm yoke. The Havarti was melted and creamy. The bialy was indeed fork tender and tasty. The lox was delish. All together it was a perfect Benedict. I look forward to returning and trying their lunch menu."}
{"text":"I usually get the traditional Lox and Bagel set up to go, and not until recently did I dine in. Actually we were outside on the misted patio with our two dogs. My brother ordered an omelet of the \"Healthy menu\" and I ordered the French Toast off the same menu column. We did the divide and conquer thing so the waitress brought extra plates, but let me just say that is probably the best french toast (or is it freedom toast) I have had in a long time. They encrust it with nuts and granola, and it is insanely good. I think they are sometimes lacking in the service area, but not enough to write a letter to the editor. It was rather busy as we were there on a Saturday AM but we did not wait long to sit."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!  We went here after someone recommended it and it was delicious!  I got the Western sliders with the onion strings and it was a lot of food, but full of flavor...the rolls they come on are so fresh and have great flavor!  The onion strings were crispy and came with a yummy dipping sauce.  I also tried on Jewish style slider which is their signature slider.  It was good, too.  My husband got a chicken sand which that he said was the best he has ever had and he is super hard to please.  It had jalepeno cheese and onion strings on it.  In fact, the whole family loved their choices.  Their desserts were good in their bakery.  Great selection on the kids menu, too!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ive ben eating at Chompies since 92' when it was at the old location on Greenway. They have the best bagels & cream cheese anywhere. I miss the bagel sampler & the fresh fruit crepes off the menu but i love this place & always will, its my go spot. huge sandwiches, delicious pastries, my brother loves the matzo ball soup. Its my comfort food. The full sour pickles they give on the tables are my true addiction. been mission ghtem, which i knew where to buy them. 
love u chompies, always."}
{"text":"Have had nothing but positive experiences coming to Chompies. The food is FANTASTIC and the service is great too! I can never stray too far away from the famous benedicts (Dave's Deli and Arizona are my favorites) but everything on their menu is full of flavor. You won't be disappointed dining at Chompies!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch today at Chompie's and were fortunate enough to be serviced by \"The Jey\"!  This young man is the absolute best in customer service.  He was upbeat, friendly, professional and the best ever.  He took time to talk and answer our questions, while serving many different areas in the restaurant.  He is a hard worker and should be commended for his work ethics.  Our only hope is that he is appreciated by his employer and will be taken care of.  The food was excellent but his service was the best ever!  We have every intention of returning and will definitely ask for \"The Jey\" again!"}
{"text":"Really? What is up with this place? Can I ever walk out of here without being stuffed and not having finished my meal???? 

I tried to be smart this time ordering a half sandwich-still too much. Thank goodness I take my doggie bags home to my little 4-legger who enjoys good meat:) The pickles are the best thing going. I just love them and can't go there without eating the entire dish of them. I was there mid morning and although not completely packed with people it was pretty full. The sandwich was so good on Jewish rye. I wish there was a location closer to where I live and then I would be in trouble cuz I think I would be there every day. Great place to go with friends after a medical procedure. Great location! Great Food. Great Service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Let's just say maybe I ordered the wrong sandwich.  I got a veggie breakfast sandwich without the cream cheese, I said to add Muenster cheese and she had them put extra mustard and then I had to ask for my cheese, just a little mix-up.  Well they added so much mustard I had to take off one of the pieces of bread.  And I do like my mustard.  The pickles are delish and got a pound to go!!!  I also got one of my fave cookies that I ate when I got home, the big white one with the sprinkles!  LOL!  Howie likes them too.  All in all just an OK experience, nothing great nothing super bad.  You would think that maybe they would give me some dry bread to replace the mustard soaked bread, but not an option.  That's OK.  Next time I will have to get something else or try Jason's deli just across the parking lot.  I have always likes Jason's!"}
{"text":"We went to Chompies for dinner, had the I/2 corned beef sandwich/soup, jewish sliders, and potato pancakes, all were good quality, deli-style food. Service was good, we asked about a particular menu item and what it was, the server did not know but came back from the kitchen with an explanation. The menu is quite large, so you will spend a good amount of time deciding what to order. I gave them 3 stars because of cost, be aware that Chompies is very expensive for a family dinner. Most sandwiches are in the $15-20 range, even simpler burgers are in the $15 range. This isn't somewhere you go to for a quick inexpensive lunch, so first time diners must be aware that Chompies is on the expensive end of restaurants, even the bakery is on the high end, everything looks delicious though."}
{"text":"Superb, great food and service!!! Nova lox is absolutely fantastic!!! Great value, great food, great place!!!"}
{"text":"Corn beef hash is the best I've ever had! If dining in a get the player, if I'm on the go I always get the corn beef hash on bagel from the bagel bar. Quick and delicious!"}
{"text":"I called to see how long the wait would be since its Father's day.  I then asked if I could add my name to the waiting list.  The girl that answered my call took my name and amount in our party (2). When we arrived I was told that we weren't able to be added to list unless we were there.  This fact would have  nice to know before we left our home 15 miles away. They didn't even bother to apologize or offer to add us to the waiting list, instead the hostess just walked away.   When I asked to talk to manager they said he would be out in a minute,  after 10 minutes I left.  Never going there again."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Chompies for years, and although it has good days and not so good days, this is the very first time that I walked out without eating anything. I never even got to a table. I was meeting friends at about 9:45 AM. We had 4 definite and 1 maybe. 2 of us had arrived and we ordered a table for 5. There was a bit of conversation between the 2 people behind the reception counter and we were told it was going to be a couple of minutes. No problem, we can wait a couple of minutes. We move off to the side. I hear them talking about where they are going to sit us, is one of the rounds (they have 2) available....kind of conversation. Apparently 1 round was available the other was being used. People come in the door behind us and identify themselves as also a party of 5. Next thing I know the gentleman who told us it was going to be a couple of minutes is telling me that they can't seat us because our entire party is not present and I watch as they seat the party of 5 that came in behind us. I am not happy. I call the people that we are going to meet to find out where they are and ask where they would like to eat because I was not staying. They came in, we discussed that we would go to Harlow's. As we were leaving, the gentleman who told me that we would not be seated until our entire party was present, and remember we weren't sure if one would be there at all, says that they can seat us. I tell him that in all if the years I had been going to Chompies no one had ever played the \"can't seat you until everyone's here rule. He points to a sign on the counter that says \"no seating until everyone is present\". I didn't doubt they had the policy just that it had never been used against me and I though the fact that he was so blatantly obvious about it was insulting. If the restaurant was packed, I might have been able to understand. If he had been more up front and  gracious about it maybe, but it wasn't packed and it was handled poorly. I am very very dissppointed in Chompies. I picked 1 star because they had a pumpkin pound cake as samples on thr deli counter."}
{"text":"I am from New York and when I woke up this morning, I was craving a New York bagel so I whip out my handy dandy phone and google New York bagels and to my surprise, this places comes up. 

I walk in and immediately am overwhelmed with their enormous selection of baked goods. We decided to stay and eat so as I was looking through their large selectioned menu and opted not to get a bagel but pancakes instead. Not sure why, I should have stuck with just a bagel but nooooooo the fat girl wanted strawberry shortcake  pancakes instead....well nothing to brag home about. They werent bad but they werent the greatest either.

Large menu with lots of breakfast itrms and lunches, I will try this place again BUT probably stick with a bagel or breakfast item or even their case out front for a goody to take home ....There lunch menu wouldnt bring me back there.

But the service was fast, very packed and still manged to get everyone in and out in a quick manner. Our waitress was friendly too."}
{"text":"I love this place. The menu was thick with a lot of choices. No matter their class  dishes or bakery, everything was yummy."}
{"text":"Yummy food, great prices, best customer service. I love everything about this store and would re come d to everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"My family had the Brooklyner, sliders, and soup.  All the food was excellent.  A bit on the pricey side for a sandwich place but I will return since I love New York Pastrami on rye.  It was served warm like a NY deli too."}
{"text":"If you want a lot of breakfast food, without even realizing you order a lot of breakfast food, then stop by Chompies. It was a saturday morning, and the place was packed, which reminded me of a bob evans after sunday church. 

Word of advice, don't read the whole menu. Have an idea of what you're craving before opening the menu, and go straight to that section. Omelet, sandwich, salad, whatever. Their menu is extensively dizzying and could give you a seizure if you stare too long at it.

I simply ordered some strawberry pancakes and my fiance ordered an omelet with some home fries and toast. I got a huge stack that had 3 pancakes with whipped cream, strawberries and syrup. My fiance's order was equally as big. She also ordered a napolean for dessert (at 9 am?) and it was way too sweet and a little on the stale side. I would guess Chompies is not known for their dessert section.

Overall, if you want good breakfast, and a lot of it at a reasonable price, then give this place a try."}
{"text":"I have eaten breakfast here for at least once a month  over the past year and never thought to review them. Let me just say that this place is awesome. I always say I'm going to try lunch but the breakfast is so good I can't move past it. The French omelet is really tasty. Yesterday I had the French Toast for the first time and I am sad that it took me so long to try it. It had a crunchy coating that makes it really comparable to funnel cake. The owners are consistently sweet and come around to thank you for dining with them. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Went here last weekend. First thing they seat you and bring you pickles. This was very interesting. The food was great. Service was great. Breakfast menu has a lot of options. Will go back often. Ok have been back a few times lately and the food was not good. Came out cold both times and portions are smaller. Will be a long time till I go back."}
{"text":"Love the pickles that are placed on the table as you sit down. I had one of the best salads I have ever had here! It was loaded with goodies - avocado, tomatoes, feta cheese, chicken, and much more! I can't remember what this salad was called, but I wish I lived out here so I could get it again and again!

Our food took a little longer than usual to come out, but no biggie! Everything was so darn good, I wish Chompie's was available in Chicago. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Chompie's is a Tempe staple!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and adequate atmosphere.  We went for breakfast while in town and my kids love deli places like this.  The food was good and the place was clean.  The lox was decent (for AZ), eggs Benedict were great, Greek omelette came cold but was still tasty and waffles were tasty too.

2 gripes...when I order coffee, why on earth would you fill it to the brim multiple times (even after I asked for a separate cup to dump some out to make room for milk)?  Most take milk or cream to lighten it up.  Also, I have a HUGE problem when I don't see Heinz ketchup on the table in favor of a less expensive brand.  If they are skimping on ketchup, are they skimping on the quality products used elsewhere in the restaraunt?

Overall positive experience and would return again."}
{"text":"Chompies is a go-to morning spot, especially after long nights. Friendly service, unique dishes, lots of flare... sometimes I just  want to pop in and hang out. The menu can be overwhelmingly huge, I often panic and order my usual fulfillment- the Arizona Benedict, plus a mound of chocolate chip pancakes. I go here expecting to break out a $20 bill because of my beast appetite, but it still seems that every item on the menu is heavily priced. Regardless, this is an extreme kind of place and I try to make it in whenever possible!"}
{"text":"Monster sandwiches dine NYC style. It's no Katz deli in manhattan buts it's good pastrami!

Def skip the rye with the fennel. I hate that! I wish they would slice the pastrami thicker! But still
Itsndelicious."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in Chompie's is fun with a lot of New York poster art and the service was prompt. The food however was poor. I had a pot roast sandwich that was tough and flavorless. This area has dozens of restaurants, next time I'm in the area I'll try a different one."}
{"text":"Fabulous Deli food.  Really enjoyed the Chrismukkah meal and the price was great.  The stuffed cabbage should be on their regular menu it was great."}
{"text":"Can't believe I've never tried Chompie's before today. The menu is massive and there really is something for everyone. I had the two egg & bacon breakfast and was able to substitute the eggs for egg whites. The menu even has potato pancakes so of course I shared one with my friend - so delicious!! Portions are really really large so keep that in mind when ordering. I wonder if anyone is ever able to finish a full portion. 

Chompie's is not only a great sit down place for breakfast, lunch or dinner but also has a huge deli where you buy their delicious bagels, baked goods, flavored cream cheeses and best of all the smoked meats!!"}
{"text":"I have partaked here many times. I dismiss the pickles in the tray that they deliver with the h2o.... What stands out for me is the LARGE amount of food you get, both at breakfast, lunch and dinner..

The Pastrami.. The best in the valley. It is always moist, tender and flavorful, especially on an Onion roll and a couple slices of Provo.. The Maple Turkey sandwich is ok, but can be dry.  I also love the Jewish Penacillin aka Chicken Noodle Soup.. 

For Bfast I would suggest the pancakes, they are freakin HUGE and tasty. I prefer the whole wheat ones with a touch of cinnamon. 

I would eat there more often if they only had Coke products. Pepsi is flat and for wimps!"}
{"text":"Saturday morning rush....
3 people, 2 meals that were good. We were told the food came to the table cold and raw (eggs) because we were sitting under the AC?? My plate was hot (mysteries of he AC workings, I guess ACs pick and choose what to air condition) and the other 2 plates cold.

2 of 3 plates sent back for being cold and eggs raw. Bald manager came out and was nice about it. Nice guy. Second order came out, and hollandaise on one plate was gross and thick and oh yeah, food cold. Complained to a different manager who rudely asked, \"What do you want me to do about it? It all came out of the pot that way.\"
Asked if he could take it off the bill and just charge for the egg that was eaten.

Waitress came over and explained that the bill was discounted, then when questioned said we could just see the bill (she had no clue). Turned out they took the one meal off.

Overall attitude. Place is going waaay down in customer service. We used to eat there once a week and now, it's been more difficult to justify the return each time.

On the plus side, I had pumpkin cranberry pancakes and they were excellent and weirdly enough HOT the entire meal. Like I said, the AC must have avoided my plate and skipped to the others'."}
{"text":"This was a first time having breakfast here. They were pretty busy but the wait wasn't long at all. The table next to us had ordered Eggs Benedict which looked really yummy. So I was between that and the salmon tapas. So I had my husband order the eggs Benedict and I ordered the tapas. They both were really good, the only two things I would change would be more hollandaise for the eggs Benedict and the Salmon tapas were pretty salty (I would just order the bagel and lox next time) Overall it was still pretty good."}
{"text":"The food was cold considering it was suppose to be Hot. Corned Beef was cold and stale. Bread was stale. Pastrami was okay not great and again the bread was stale. Pickles needed to be still canned. For the price of these sandwiches you would think you would get an entire sandwich....nope just a half. I am soooo disappointed. Will not order from here again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a little kid and every time I visit Arizona it is a must. The egg salad sandwich on challah gives me life. The matzoh ball soup is delicious. The black and white cookies. The fact that they have YooHoos. So good."}
{"text":"The Jewish Sliders are really tasty.  They have a 'challenge' to eat a dozen in 30mins, popularized by Man v Food.

I could easily eat 6 for a full meal.  They're that good!

The pickles are a nice side too.  I liked the green ones (ok, the BRIGHTER green ones!).

I also ordered a Meat Knish, but I would've been better off ordering a second order of Sliders.

I'd go back any time for the Sliders.  Actually, the Mile-High Sandwiches looked good too, so I may give one of those a shot.

Update:  I had the Mile-High New Yorker with Corned Beef.  It was not worth $12 for a deli sandwich.  Certainly there's a lot of meat wedged between some rye, but the CB was really stringy.  So much so that it was getting caught in my throat as I was trying to swallow bites...UGH.

That experience dropped the rating from the 4-stars on the Jewish Sliders to 3-stars."}
{"text":"Our family of four went to Chompies following ASU graduation yesterday. The line was out the door and it was very crowded but we had agreed to wait as long as necessary as we love the food here. What impressed me most at this visit was the attitude of the staff.  Mitch was working hard trying to accommodate everyone, with and without reservations and the hostesses and servers kept their high energy positive attitudes up even when guests were vocal about their disappointment about the wait. The service at the table was perfect, as if we were the only ones there and they kept refilling my husband's complimentary pickles. I can't begin to imagine how our server managed to do everything she did with a smile.  The food is delicious, it's clean as a whistle and the staff is great. All trips to ASU include at least one trip to Chompies."}
{"text":"Good place for bagels.   My personal fav is with everything.

The sandwiches are huge, I could only manage 1/2 and had to save the rest for later.   Not cheap, but you do get what you paid for.

While I haven't yet to find something totally amazing there, I love that they're not a chain."}
{"text":"A great way to escape the Arizona heat and a great chance to practice your New York accent. I am a full blooded New Yorker on tour in a reggae band, and this spot brought be right back to butter & rainbow cookies! I ordered the white albacore sandwich it was bisque!! Knish was prime with as much spicy brown mustard as I could eat. Also bottomless Arnold Palmers and kosher pickles."}
{"text":"If you miss the ambience of a Jewish style deli, Chompies is a HR. Hearty portions, delicious cabbage soup, good service. I highly recommend Chompies."}
{"text":"I went to Chompies today to pick up a few baked goods for work tomorrow. As I stood at the counter to place my order the gentleman behind the counter clearly ignored me and took the orders of 2 people that got in line behind me. I almost yelled \" Am I invisible\". Thankfully a women came out and happily took my order. The baked goods from Chompies are actually quite good that is why I continue to go there despite the poor service that I always receive there."}
{"text":"The food is just eh, but it's fun to go here for some Jewish food. Everybody loves their sliders too!"}
{"text":"BOMB BOMB BOMB best Jewish deli especially in AZ. Eggs Benedict!!! Not to mention mile high sandwiches, black and white cookies, bagels and shmear galore. I wish I was eating this right now."}
{"text":"I actually blame myself for giving this place a second chance.  To be honest, I am not sure how they stay in business as they lack customer service, attention to detail, etc.  This time I called in a pickup order as I was out running some errands.  Spoke with a gentleman to place the order which consisted of TWO number #1's, scrambled, American Cheese, Bacon on Toasted Gluten Free Bagels.  I swung by and picked up the order, paid $13.08 and then left to go home.  My second mistake, was not checking the order right then and there.  
When I got home, I went and sat down at the kitchen table.  I opened up my first bagel sandwich and sure enough it didn't have any bacon on it.  I also noticed that the Bagel wasn't toasted as I had asked for.  The second bagel sandwich was the same way.  
Did I pay extra for Bacon?  Of course I did.  Why does this keep happening?  What goes wrong with your process that doesn't allow the credit order to get back to the kitchen to make the sandwiches?  Very frustrating!  As mentioned, not sure how this place stays in business as they obviously don't care about their customers and the service(s) they offer."}
{"text":"I am VERY disappointed in this location. I grew up on the original Chompie's, next to the bowling alley on Shea, and I hate to say that out of all 3 trips to the Frye location I have endured, all have had very poor service and my food has come out wrong each time.  Order eggs over medium, get scrambled...order bacon extra crispy, get limp barely cooked bacon...order garlic bagel, get onion...hashbrowns cooked lightly, get them almost burnt...order bagel lightly toasted, get burnt bagel....seriously, a server has to have some serious chutzpah to serve a burnt bagel!

Each time I went it was 1030-1100 on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  Each time I waited almost 10 minutes after being seated for my server to show up.  Thank goodness for the busser/water guy!

No manager to be found.  When asked to take my food back and correct it, it wasa big deal.  

Lovey and the family would be very disappointed to know this was how a customer was being treated in their family's well established restaurant."}
{"text":"Love Chompies! We had .99 sliders on their anniversary, and we were expecting a long wait. Much to our surprise, we ordered, and were served VERY quickly. The food was great, and our waiter was wonderful."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give zero stars that would have been my option, no longer will be returning to this location....the service that we had received by our waitress Vera was unbelievable!! It was my sisters first time going there and worst experience her and I have ever had! We ordered our food and minutes after ordering our food our waitress Vera came and asked if we wanted boxes, we had only taken a few bites out of our food! She never came to refill our drinks...She already had our bill readily available and placed it at the table next to us, we felt as if we were being pushed out! When we looked at our bill she had over charged us. When we tried to get her attention to make the correction on our bill she ignored us and walked the other way.  After losing our appetite and not wanting to be there anymore we asked for some boxes, she passed our table 3 times when she finally passed last time she told us she had forgotten our boxes.  When it came to paying our bill she had seen I was placing my card in, when she quickly turned right around to come back to charge. Never have we ever felt so unwanted, and highly dissatisfied!!"}
{"text":"Good food, but beware of the All you can eat specials fine print.  We went expecting to take advantage of the kids eat free promotion they have early in the week.  I chose to do the All you can eat sliders, after being told about it by the waiter.  What I wasn't aware of is that it voided their kids eat free promotion.  With a large family, that hurt.  Our reasonably priced dinner out sucked up two weeks worth of dinners out in one go.   If you have more than two kids, Jason's Deli is a more cost effective Deli in the area.  Even better, Dilly's Deli on the weekends!"}
{"text":"The quality of food at Chompie's has gone downhill drastically.  Last night we ordered the French Dip sandwich and the meat was so tough that we had to throw 2 thirds of it out.  We ordered potato pancakes and they were burned!  How disgusting.  The dill pickle that comes with this was limp not crisp.  We also ordered a chopped liver sandwich.  The bread was soggy, yuck.  This food was ordered takeout so we could not send it back. Believe me we will consider whether we should order from Chompie's takeout, but we will probably not again since this is our second problem with their takeout (The first was when we ordered a full sandwich and when we got home there was only 1/2 sandwich.)"}
{"text":"Chompies is my favorite place to go for brunch anytime I am close by. They have great specials. A great selection. It is the closest thing to an NY restaurant and deli around."}
{"text":"Baaaaahhhhh...i'm so sad about having to give this one three stars.

Let me start this by saying that I LOVE Chompies bagels. In my mind, they are the best. ESPECIALLY the shmear. Deeeelish. Now, that goes for the bagels...not so much for the rest of it. 

Our server...umm...had issues. Let's just leave it at that. I would normally say that he was overwhelmed, but it was 3 in the afternoon - so that one is a bit hard for me to swallow (that's what she said, i know). The other thing that was hard to swallow was the food. 

I ordered the London Tunnel Sandwich. Sounded yummy...roasted turkey, pastrami, coleslaw, 1000 island - all on yummy rye. Well..not impressed. My advice, just eat the rye with a side of fries. As I was chewing on my sandwich, I had this moment of realization: You are eating a sandwich at Chompies...this is supposed to be knocking you off your chair...especially for 14 bucks. This thought made me choke. 

Lesson learned: Buy the bagels and shmear and grab desert on the way out. Save your ass from the uncomfortable seat, your mind from having to deal with dumb servers and your throat/mouth from the uncomfortable feeling of gross food engulfing it. 

The end."}
{"text":"Found a perfect spot for an early morning meeting, Chompie's in Tempe is convenient, with nice, friendly-service and a great homemade corned beef hash.

When I order coffee, I just love that someone is always coming by to refill the cup and when I ask a question about the menu, I love when that person gives me their honest opinion. I can be picky with my food and Chompie's gave me the best service.  I like the corned beef hash that comes out of the can and although some would consider that disgusting, something about the right amount of salt and crunch, I just happen to love it. So, after asking our server about the corned beef hash, she suggested that I try it and if I didn't like it, I could take it back! That is incredible service because (A) she stood by her product and (B) guaranteed their service was going to be awesome, which also described the corned beef hash.

Also, the menu is robust with a lot of options, so definitely try Chompie's in Tempe."}
{"text":"Bagel and Lox platter was delicious. Highly recommend. Unfortunately the French toast was very disappointing. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that Chompie's has opened a location here on the west side! I plan on working my way eventually though the whole menu. Today for lunch I had the classic burger with wedge fries and coleslaw. The bun was fresh and toasted - the beef patty was prepared nicely - the fries and coleslaw were both delicious. The whole meal was huge! My husband had the sourdough patty melt. He says it was delicious. The service was really friendly and prompt too. We expected to see some rough edges in a restaurant that's just opened, but our experience was very good. 
Until next time ....

4/16: Stopped in for breakfast this time. 2 eggs, over hard, with turkey sausage (delish), a potato pancake (omg) and an onion bagel with cream cheese (fluffy on the inside and just lightly toasted on the outside - perfect). The rest of the folks at my table ordered matzo ball soup - looked amazingly like homemade, blueberry pancakes - wonderful, and hamburger - already reviewed earlier."}
{"text":"What's worse than trying to take a sweet kid out to a restaurant when they have food allergies and they're surrounded by dairy and gluten-y deliciousness they can't eat? When their little face drops and they stare at their lap? What's worse? What's worse would the hostess when you call being irritated about your questions regarding the ability to make a GF French toast dairy free also! She didn't even want to check, but after being pressed to do so she returns to the phone to say \"no because it's dipped in egg.\" *ugh* Egg is not dairy! So I asked if they could just dip the GF bread in egg and not dairy with egg. \"No.\" So I said (rather snidely, I admit) \"so your breakfast place doesn't have plain eggs?\" I get a sharp reply \"the product has dairy in it.\" Most GF bread is also dairy free, but aside from that I didn't ask to clarify because food allergies are clearly a nuisance here. I would beware if you have any food allergies. So glad I didn't disappoint my little girl by going here in person and trying to accommodate her. GF and allergy families beware!"}
{"text":"Chompies catered my daughter's Bat Mitzvah, they did a wonderful job!  The food was fantastic and priced so much better than other caterers I had contacted.  We have eaten at their deli's for years!  We love Lovie and her staff!"}
{"text":"Service was great, staff is friendly and prompt. 

Tuna sandwich on marble rye with fries and a drink $15.  

Bread was dry and crumbly, tuna was dry.  Fry wedges were good but nothing special.

Update: customer service contacted me and they will work to improve the experience. +1 for caring!"}
{"text":"Great bagels, great coffee, great service, no matter how early the service staff always has a smile."}
{"text":"The food may be great but the service is awful.  I'm not sure if it is even legal to do what they did.  It was busy inside so they offered us open seating outside.  We went out there and there was bird poop on all of the tables.  They refused to clean the tables and said they didn't have the staff to do it.  Keep in mind that the manager had to come outside to tell us all.  She could have easily grabbed a cloth and done it in the amount of time it took to tell us.  So, if you want to eat at a table with bird poop on it, this is your place!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while, but I went today to get some Black and White Cookies for my mom's birthday. I looked at the glass display for them, but couldn't find any. Within less than a minute, an employee (Robert) came up to ask if I needed anything. He was extremely friendly and showed me where the cookies were (I missed them over by the cashier- oops), and asked which ones I wanted for her. Honestly, I can't remember the last time I went somewhere where the people working had such genuine smiles. He was super sweet and the cookies were great. Just the customer service alone makes me want to go back. :)"}
{"text":"Food was wrong the first time out and the second time out. Got to watch my family eat because they couldn't get a sandwich right. The third time I ate it as our show was due to start. By their rushing it the third time it was just thrown together and resembled something my grandson would have made and was very disappointing. My daughter said her food was nothing to rave about. Maybe the staff was having a bad day"}
{"text":"This is my first time dining at Chompies, my husband and I had lunch here and it was very good. 

Our server Arthur was attentive and funny and made us feel very welcome. I ordered the Rachel Ruben with a side of sweet and sour cabbage soup my husband had the half tongue sandwich. 

The soup was good just like a cabbage roll but with out the beef and rice. I really enjoyed the coleslaw that came with the sandwich just wish for a bigger portion. The taste of the corned beef was good but the texture was a little chewy and firm. 

My husband beef tongue was amazing. Great flavor and texture. The rye bread both sandwiches came on was really good to.

all said service is a five and food a four. Will be back to try the whitefish."}
{"text":"Excellent pastries. Huge sandwiches along with a huge menu. Our server was horrible but I don't always like that to reflect upon the food."}
{"text":"Tried this place for breakfast food and it was tasty.  ALL of the food looks great as it is being carried past our table. I will go back."}
{"text":"I love the weekday special, Eggciting, cheap breakfast. It's so good and always fills me up for the whole day and only $4. Can't beat it, anywhere. I love it, love it."}
{"text":"We went with 6 people and ordered many different meals.  Here's a summary...  
Pros:  Food was amazing!  Good portion size.  Excellent pastrami!  Bagels were perfectly toasted.  Syrup was the best we've ever had!  French toast was cooked well on the outside and soft on the inside - \"so good!\"  We were in a rush and it was only 35 minutes from the time we were seated until we left - the waitress was very accommodating!  Potatoes had very flavorful seasoning.
Cons:  It took a long time to get a table for 6 people (not crowded on a Tuesday at noon).  The waiting area was very warm.  Our waitress had a cold and wiped her runny nose on her hand."}
{"text":"My first time coming to Chompie's and couldn't have been more delighted. I had two of the Jewish sliders and the bombka crumb French toast. Both were unreal. As a spring training veteran, I have added this place to my list of stops for each year. 

The NY vibe with the deli in front of the restaurant is great too--grabbed some pastries on the way out!"}
{"text":"I hate to have to give this place two stars as I've been a loyal customer at the other locations. The food was unbelievably great and the service was unbearable."}
{"text":"This is the second time here for breakfast, and sadly we won't be back for a sit-down meal. The menu  selections are great, the dining room is well decorated, and the front bakery counter is incredible; however the wait staff members are horrible. They are so uninterested in their work. Our waiter took forever to take our order. He mumbled so I had to ask him to repeat himself every time he said something. He seemed bored and sleepy. Then he and the other wait staff disappeared. The restaurant only had three other tables at the time, and there were three waiters/waitresses working. They must have gone to hang out in the back because we saw no one until our order came. The order took longer than expected, and was cold when it arrived. Who wants to eat cold eggs and cold pancakes - the butter wouldn't even melt on the pancakes. And the waiter disappeared again and didn't come back until he brought our bill. 
The food could be really good if it was hot. This happened to us the first time we were here also. Expensive too. We each had the same breakfast - two eggs, two strips of bacon and two pancakes. No drinks other than water and the total was over $21. Too expensive for poor service and cold food. Sorry, won't be back."}
{"text":"I always get the same thing when I come here, which is the Jewish Sliders. Oh my gosh, they are so yummy! My mouth waters just thinking about them! Also the prices are descent and the service is good!"}
{"text":"The bagels aren't what they used to be. They taste like grocery store bagels. Bummer."}
{"text":"Love this place, Spanish lady is the best, she always makes my order perfevt, sometimes I don't even have to tell her what I need, she just knows and remembers everything:))"}
{"text":"How could you not love this place! My family owns restaurants and it definitely takes me home with the family walking around checking on you. Home cooked meals, super tasety, breakfast all day, a desert bar that a fat kid would kill for, and everything is fresh."}
{"text":"Food is so so. Staffs were rude. Might as well just go across the street to Jason's Deli. To add insult to injury, they overcharged us and refuse to issue partial refund."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say! However I am embarrassed to say that after living here for 11 years this is my first time going  here. I am going to frequent this place as I found out they have one close to my house (PV Mall)

Had the Pastrami sandwich with 1000 dressing and sauerkraut.  and the Matzo ball soup all I say is, Mmmm!!!! 

Can't wait to try breakfast... They even serve bloody marys and mimosas for those extra hungover weekend moments."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with good Jewish cuisine and I was in heaven! The menu has a HUGE selection plus they have a ton of pastries to choose from for dessert. Everything we ordered was delicious: 
1) potato latkes: crispy, piping hot and was delicious by itself and with the sour cream and applesauce it came with.- 4 stars
2) cheese blintz/bluebery blintz: both delicious on it's own, but even better when mixed! - 3 stars
3) Jewish sliders: challah bread stuffed with tender brisket, potato pancake, cheese and gravy. - 3 stars
4) BBQ sliders: it's the same as the Jewish slider except instead of the potato pancake and gravy, they put onions strings and BBQ sauce in it (my favorite of the two).- 5 stars
5) chocolate chip pancakes: light and fluffy! - 4 stars
6) reuben sandwich: the pastrami in this sandwich was amazingly good and they don't skimp on the meat! - 5 stars
7) matzo ball chicken soup: this was everything that's comforting when it comes to soup. Great broth, chunky veggies, soft noodles, and a huge matzo ball! - 5 stars
I'll definitely have to come back to try some of the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Teresa, the manager, assisted us with a minor problem we encountered. Prior to this incident, we have always had outstanding service. She went well above and insisted on treating us to dessert, despite our protests. She genuinely worked to resolve the issue. thank you, and of course we will be back."}
{"text":"Chompie's is delicious.  I always use their call ahead so we don't have to wait (since they definitely are busy on the weekends).  This weekend they seated our party of 13 Sunday morning as soon as we got there.  

Bustling, animated and fun- Chompie's not only offers high quality breakfasts and lunches but a dynamic, fast-pace for dining.  You may need to wait a little bit for your food since they get so busy- but that's part of the experience.  Just keep busy with the various football games displayed on their tvs throughout the restaurant. It's nice too that you can walk through the restaurant and the staff gets to know who you are- that sure doesn't happen at big chains. 

Personally I enjoy their coffee over ice with hazelnut creamer, Chompie's egg breakfast with loose scrambled eggs with american cheese on top, and their everything bagel with olive pimento cream cheese.  Their potato pancakes are incredible with sour cream and apple sauce.  Yum. 

Gretchen is by far their best server with her 100% accuracy for orders and her charming attitude.  When I'm traveling or on vacation I miss home since I miss out on my weekend ritual of Chompie's!"}
{"text":"This was the worst Reuben I ever had! It was 16.00 and check out the photo to see the amount of fat! Gross! Would never have this again!"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far. I will be eating here again. First time had matz ball soup and brisket sliders which were both great. Second time had a pastrami with hotdog and soup all were excellent. This is about as good as it gets for a Ny style deli in AZ."}
{"text":"Okay. I LOVE this place but they need to seriously change the way they handle carry out orders. I'm Jewish and I found this slice of heaven after newly moving to Tempe and I couldn't have been happier. I go here all the time, hesitantly of course because I know they will screw something up. Don't worry, they always do. They're lucky their food is so good and that I love it so much. 
If you dine in you're fine. Enjoy!
But carry-out diners beware! (This is the reason for only three stars.) It's like they need two registers at the deli. One for people placing orders and one for people picking up. Do you know how many times I have been behind families ordering food, one person ordering dozens of bagels, all while looking at my food that I can see the steam going away from getting cold. I mean it's painful. Please fix this, Chompies. Please.
Maybe 50% of the time there's something wrong with my food. But it's also not fair because I'm picky and often change lots of things. Regardless, the two or three times I've said something the person at the deli has either a) not cared or offered to fix anything. b) tried fixing it herself and she did it wrong/weird because she's not the cook or c) took it back and brought me a new one!
All-in-all I will continue to eat here because it's just too delicious. I am sincerely hopeful Chompie's will read this and fix their carry out issue though."}
{"text":"The breakfast sliders are awesome.  Saw them on Man vs. Food and had to try them."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! I had a \"mile high\" pastrami on sourdough bread and it was extremely bland pastrami had no flavor and their bread tastes like regular bread when it was supposed to be sourdough and it came with dull flavored pickles. I almost forgot to mention that it had no mustard. NONE! Choking down this abomination ruined my day and put me in a bad mood. This place is the place to go for blandness. I gave you a star for your ability to operate a restaurant that has bland food."}
{"text":"I had a new experience today.  For the first time in my 4 decades of life, I left a restaurant without eating there because I was mad,  and it was this Chompie's.

I was actually looking for a location to host a Meetup group that I'm the organizer for.  I saw that Tuesday was \"Kids Eat Free\" night so my 2 1/2 year old son and I went to check it out.  It was a beautiful night and we wanted to sit outside.  The tables were all set up on the patio  but apparently the server did not want us to eat outside because she was training someone and it would make it harder.  Our hostess went and asked another server, who also was not able or willing to serve us outside.  So, our options were to eat inside or to get it as takeout and sit out on one of the picnic-like tables outside without service.  We elected for the takeout, even though it was not the most convenient thing in the world to juggle the food with a toddler clinging to my leg.

When I went to pay for the takeout, I was charged for the Kids Meal, too.  I brought up the \"Kids Eat Free\" and she said that was only for dining in, but she would ask the manager because of our circumstance.  She came back and said no, that the Kids Meal would not be free.  I think she was actually trying, the only person there I can say that about.

By that point, I was so annoyed that we went to Sprouts, got some nice, fresh strawberries, and went home, made our own sandwiches and opened a can of soup.  Probably healthier anyway, though I had been looking forward to trying the Reuben and the matzo ball soup.

I'd imagine they didn't care much because I was not a big ticket customer with one adult and a free Kids Meal.  But with that experience, there is absolutely no way I will go back, much less host a large group there.  I called Paradise Bakery and they have a room we can reserve if we have enough people.  Problem solved."}
{"text":"Great spot!!! Much more than a deli! Their breakfast is excellent and very reasonably priced. Would suggest going on a weekday rather than a weekend."}
{"text":"With the absence of Miracle Mile, I was anxious to try Chompies.  I've been there three times since their recent opening at Arrowhead Mall, and two of the visits were fine.  For my first visit, I ordered the chopped liver sandwich with fries.  The sandwich was good enough to warrant a second visit. My second visit was very disappointing.  I ordered the smoked whitefish salad sandwich, and although the flavor was good, there were three 1\" bones in the sandwich!  I have ordered whitefish at other restaurants and never have I found bones.  Not sure if this is the norm for Chompies, but I would suggest adding a disclaimer on the menu that there may be bones.  For me, I will never order the whitefish salad again.  

My most recent visit was much better.  I ordered the grilled cheese and turkey sandwich. The sandwich was a tad greasy, but I would order it again."}
{"text":"Jewish sliders are crazy good, get extra dark gravy. Most the deserts are worth a try."}
{"text":"I recently tried this location for breakfast.  Between my party of 3, the order consisted \"Dave's Deli Benedict\", \"Stuffed Pancake\" and a short stack of \"Blueberry Pancakes\".  My word!... let me just comment on the portion sizes... humongous and the food was hella tasty!

We had about a 15 minute wait to be seated, which about norm for Sunday morning crowds.  Food arrived with a decent amount of time and the server was uber nice and attentive.  The Benedict contained corned beef hash and home fries.  The poach eggs on the Benedict made me think they used ostrich eggs due to the volume. The blueberry pancakes were each the size of a big platter (yes, I said platter and not plate).  The stuffed pancake was truly stuffed like a burrito.  None of us were able to empty our plates due to the amount of food given.  

We all left as big fans and will make this recurring stop on a go-forward basis!"}
{"text":"Took forever to get seated and forever to get our food. Do t recommend coming with parties more than five by the time we got our food it was cold the fact that we haven't gotten food and have been here for 2 hours is awful!! Do not recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here a few times but had heard a lot about Chompie's. I saw something on Food Network \"Man Vs.Food\" where the host had to eat 12 Jewish Sliders..I just had to try them out. One night a few months back me and my partner wanted to eat at Famous Dave's nearby. They were packed so I said I wanted to check out Chompie's. We were not disappointed. Every time I go I just get the Jewish Slider combos (3 sliders and fries)..It is delish!  My partner usually orders a sandwich or fish and chips.  The service was adequate, nothing to complain about. 

The only problem anyone had was when someone ordered ribs, they were not that good.  Save that for the bbq place. What I love is that Chompie's also has the bakery/deli counter in the front."}
{"text":"Good vegan split pea soup, prices a bit high for what you receive though."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a lox and bagel platter, can ya? Didn't think so. Great way to get protein, veggies, and a carbs all in one. Always finish my plate. I love the variety of veggies that come with the platter, too. Coffee is good too!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Chompies innumerable times, and by-and-large the food is quite good.  As an aside, I enjoy the food at this location more than at the Chompies location on Shea Blvd.  In addition, this location tends to get quite busy on work days after 12 pm.  This especially holds true when ASU is in session.

The portions at Chompies are large.  I can't remember ordering an item and feeling as though I was being served an insubstantial portion.  Plus there are AYCE pickles and that always helps the pass the modest wait for the food to come to the table.  The mile high deli sandwiches are as the name implies, BIG.  I have found that there is more than enough food if you opt for a half-sandwich served on a bagel or roll.  Their babka French toast is quite good and so are their omelets.  If you have a sweet tooth, and enjoy French toast, this is definitely a dish that is worth a try."}
{"text":"Loved it! Great sliders, after watching man vs food i wanted to come here. Don't think about doing the slider challenge because 3 sliders are filling enough. Great friendly staff as well"}
{"text":"Went there skinny came out gaining 25 pond heavier great food i would recommend everyone if you have nit been there your missing out on life"}
{"text":"Big deli sandwiches.  Multiple variations on a rueben. We had an corned beef and pastrami sandwich which was excellent.  Kids chicken fingers and fries were a hit. All kinds of cookies brownies cakes, etc etc."}
{"text":"Impressive sandwiches (Reubens and Monte Cristos are recommended) and a dessert selection that's to die for. Sliders are okay, but not worth it compared to some of the other stuff on the menu.

Service is usually good, but on my last visit, it was lacking. Granted, it was Father's Day. However, the one thing that should not take a super-long time is getting the check to me."}
{"text":"First time was perfection. Never have I ever had a more pleasing experience at a restaurant. Kendrick was so nice and treated my daughter with goodies to thank us for our visit. Our waiter was sweet as can be I feel terrible I forgot his name but he was darning. I can not wait to visit again. The food was delicious!"}
{"text":"One of my top five favorite places in Tempe to eat! Everything is good, reasonable pricing. Homemade=better than not! Arizona Benedict is amazing!"}
{"text":"Man vs. Food (2010) Phoenix episode!  Just watch it!  The Jewish Sliders are just as good as they look on the show.  I've only tried one other thing on the menu, but I wouldn't order anything else after trying the sliders.  I'm so jealous that the ASU students have such an awesome place like this near campus."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend in Tempe and we decided to go to Chompie's for breakfast. Excellent place with an amazing breakfast environment and gracious service. Great food and an overall great experience. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"What restaurant did we just visit???  The one who has excellent customer service?  The one whose staff doesn't treat a customer like a friggin' inconvenience??  Which doesn't sell inferior deli-counter meats (dried out, gristle-streaked pastrami)??  The one who manages its menu and has plenty of side dishes including its famous potato salad???  The one which has superlative reviews???  Were we just visiting the Chompie's in the Twilight Zone, or did we time our visit between staff-and-admin-shift-HELL, so that we were treated like something that was drug over the threshold like dog sh*t on the bottom of a shoe?  If we could have cancelled our order, we would have. What has become of this place????  Don't expect us back."}
{"text":"Nicholas took great care of our party of 7! We were greeted quickly and seated almost as fast. 

We ordered and enjoyed the perfect amount of time for coffee before our meal arrived! We enjoyed delicious food, all of us ordering extremely different items. We never ran shy on coffee or other drinks. All our special request were met with a smile and executed thoroughly.  The \"mouse\" pancakes where huge and the kids loved the blueberry eyes, pineapple mouth and cherry nose!

We really enjoyed ourselves at Chompie's!"}
{"text":"The pastrami was amazing! We ordered a Reuban and a mile high pastrami sandwich and both were delicious. They definitely do not skimp on the meat. Angela provided excellent service to top off our great meal. My son's grilled cheese sandwich was left on a little too long that's the reason for the missing fifth star but she took care of it for us."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Chompies ( about 4 years ago ) I was dissapointed. My breakfast was gross and my pancakes had too much buttermilk . But recently when I went and had dinner it was SUPERB . I got the brisket meal. When I say I was tooken aback on how delicious it was , I am not lying . THE AU JUS Was the juice that stole my heart. Now I know STICK TO NON BREAKFAST :)"}
{"text":"We went to Chompies for lunch yesterday with our family and were very pleased.  The food was delicious and plentiful and the waitress, who was pleasant and efficient, did an excellent job.  I have some food restrictions and appreciated that the food was cooked exactly as I had requested."}
{"text":"We sat there 10 minutes before anyone even came up to our table, service was poor and food was meh. However, certainly not worth it considering it gave us terrible food poisoning!! I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the food, been there numerous times. On the weekends (sat./Sun.) I expect a wait no matter what time, especially during the school year.

But a 15 minute wait at 2PM on a Friday during the end of the semester, for one person? When there was no one at the hostess station in front of me?

Forget that - walked out and not heading back any time soon unless other people insist."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat breakfast!  Despite the parking lot being packed, we were seated right away, served great food, the man was able to watch some football, and I had plenty of people watching to do.  

Finally, a flexible menu, none of the same ole'. 

Big servings, definately splittable, and the cake looks wonderful.  Next time, we will grab one on the way out.  

4.5 stars.  All that's missing is crepes."}
{"text":"Ahhhh Chompies. I have been to the Chompies around the valley for years now and all of them are fantastic. The place is ALWAYS busy and what it occasionally lacks in bright eyed, smiling servers, it totally makes up for in consistently GOOD FOOD! I love their bagels, their soups, the sandwiches are almost too much to eat at once, the salads are great and if you stop in for breakfast, the omelettes are... well let's say I have literally written home about them. Prices are more than fair for what you get and they are fast! 

This is one of those places that works for a casual client meeting spot, a meal with the family (it's actually loud enough that the wife and I don't have to panic when our 2 year old has a freak out) or a quick bite on your own. I don't know why, but this is one of those places where you see lots of people eating by themselves and it doesn't look sad. The take out counter is quick and I seriously can't say enough about how much I like the food.... seriously!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong going to this Jewish deli! The food is great! Had the perogis and the Wendy's sandwich!  Huge! Sandwich! Had to share it with the hubs! They serve pickles instead of bread! Love that! The deli counter is so cute! We went home with a cannoli (leave the gun, take the cannoli) and an eclair that looks magical. I may have to update this after eating them later! Lol! Great atmosphere here. We will return!"}
{"text":"The menu is astounding, so many choices. Truly something for everyone - Jewish classics, Mexican items, super-healthy items, super NOT healthy items, Dr. Brown's sodas.
The breads are really good as they make them themselves - I noticed the buns on the burgers and sliders are definitely better quality than the typical delivery buns other restaurants have to choose from. YUMMY hot pastrami on rye!

Prices a bit high. But I will say it's a LOT of food, and easily creates another meal to go, or two of us share one!
Atmosphere: Love the NY murals all over the walls, complete with subway signs. If I were from NY, I'd feel at home again.

We have no complaints. Everyone has been friendly, service timely, and no problems at all.

TIP: GREAT matzo ball soup, one of the best around according to my Jewish friends."}
{"text":"After going to canter's and greenblats and factors this place was all right i went with three others on a Sunday at 12:30 and the line was pretty long but we only waited 30 min for a table's when taking a few mins to look at the bake goods counter. and the freshly baked bread i saw a eclair that looked good so i thought why not try it.It should be good.It was all right I would at not time go out of my way for it. after begin sited i ordered a knish which was really oily.With a plate of three sliders.Which has sliced brisket with cheese and a small potato pancake on the bottom. What i was surprised about was i had to ask for a side of apple sauce which of you have ever enjoyed potato pancakes you have to have apple sauce seemed to me in a nut shell that we where all given large amount of food.But the food seemed to not really stand out flavor wise."}
{"text":"Good food. Horrible staff. Put in a take out order today at 10:34. Told 20 minutes. Arrived at Chompies 22 minutes later to a long line because the cashier is completely confused with every customer. I finally get to her and she says the order will be ready in 5 minutes and cashes me out. 5 minutes later she looks again, still can't find it. Another guy comes out to check and it was sitting on the counter the whole time. The hand me the bag of lukewarm food 50 minutes after the original order with an \"I'm sorry\". I get home and 2 of the sides are missing. 

The food would be good if they could figure out how to get it to you properly."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here for the first time and it was amazing!!! Great food, great service!!! Had an awsome time! Our server was Anthony and he was fantastic! Funny, knew the menu well, made great reccomendations! And because of him I will 100% be back!"}
{"text":"This place isn't that bad.  Maybe I caught it on an off day or it could have been because if the rain outside but the service was so so.  It seemed that our waitress was not interested in helping us out but rather talking with a guy that I assumed was her boyfriend by the way she was hanging on him by the front door.  

The food, it was good.  Not great but it was good.  This place has been made famous and I can say I have been there to try the Original Sliders.  I will go back again for them, but for take out only.  Not going to get in the way of a waitress and a guy who walked in the door."}
{"text":"My go to spot for breakfast/brunch. Chompie's isn't trendy, so if you're looking for that, then skip. They do however execute very well, have large portions, and a very courteous staff. Oh and a local family owns the place. 

My go to order is the Chorizo con Queso omlette (random order for a Jewish place I know). Omlettes are huge, plus include home fries AND a bagel w/ cream cheese. I honestly have never had their lunch or dinner items, but they seem to do pretty good business. The lunch/dinner options definitely lean more towards NYC Jewish Deli than the breakfast menu. They even give out free pickles. 

My favorite part of being there is when the old lady (I'm assuming owner?) comes around to ask how we're doing. She makes the rounds every weekend morning as is always so gracious to see everyone."}
{"text":"Like with a chinese joint you check the fried rice and the egg roll to know if its legit, here you gotta try the pastrami for the legit check. Although the size is good and what every RAVES about, the quality just ain't there. I'm from Queens NY and eaten at the best NY places and it just doesn't stack up. First off, the Pastrami got the consistency of \"rubber beef\" like cheap Roast Beef from Subway, huge turn off. Roast beef kinda the same, like its a solution soaked piece of meat before cooking, hell, even Jersey Mikes does a better Roast Beef, its got FLAVOR. Epic fail on my two favs. No real Jewish deli would be caught dead serving that rubber meat garbage. . That was strike one. My sister in law was in town and took her here, she had the fish and had food poisoning for the next 3 days. That was strike 2. I called to inform the manager, they NEVER called back to offer an apology or like normal a coupon for free food etc. Strike 3, eat at your own risk. Faux NY Deli at its best"}
{"text":"I'm not a New Yorker...I'm a transplanted Chicagoan. It's frustrating that there is such a limited supply of Deli's in this area-- and there is nothing that even approaches a great Chicago style Deli. This is the second time I've eaten at Chompies, and both times have been a huge disappointment. 
The other night we went for dinner. We felt like we sat forever before someone waited on us. Then she disappeared- more interested in taking pictures of a group of slider eaters in back. Another waiter showed up later...looked at me and asked me if I was the \"mashed potatoes\". I said yes, and he told me they were OUT of mashed potatoes. Since I was having hot turkey-- this was quite disappointing. After much more waiting, I ended up asking when our meals would arrive ( we had been there an hour already) My plate of turkey with dressing and their interpretation of french fries arrived...with congealed cold gravy on the side. Everything was SOOOOoooo salty, it was borderline inedible. My husband got what they consider a ham and cheese omelet. Scrambled looking eggs with slices of cheese on top. Mediocre at best. 
I doubt I'll return for a meal, other than to buy bagels from their take out."}
{"text":"Love Chompie's !!  I grew up in Philly and also lived in New Jersey for many years before moving here, and Chompie's food makes me feel like I'm back on the east coast where there were many, many places like Chompie's.  The menu selections are fantastic and the food is also fantastic.  There are many items on the menu that you can't get anywhere else in the Phoenix & surrounding areas besides the other Chompie's locations, as far as I know.  Speaking of the food, the portion sizes are great !  I really love this place !!"}
{"text":"Really good Jewish breakfast sliders, Jewish sliders, and buffalo benedict."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé went to have dinner and this is the first time we decided to eat at chompies. We were excited to try it out but that quickly turned as we got seated and no body came by for at least ten minutes. Then when our waitress finally came by and asked for our drinks we asked for water with no lemon. We ended up with lemon. We brushed it off then waited for an addition ten minutes before she decided to come back for our order. I ordered the monte Cristo and asked for all turkey no ham and my fiancé ordered the Texas longhorn burger with no coleslaw on it and instead of onion rings he wanted regular fries. She said ok then we waited for another 20 min with her just talking to the host instead of checking our waters. When she finally came with our food she told me she got yelled at by the kitchen for my request of all turkey and that I'm lucky. My fiancé on the other hand got exactly what he didn't want. Coleslaw on his burger and onion rings. She said she couldn't substitute the onion rings. At this point I had enough I asked for a manager and she said ok and disappeared we ended up asking another waiter to get the manager wasting another ten minutes of our time. This being the first time at chompies will be the last. Unfortunately one star is the lowest I could go. If I could I would give a 0."}
{"text":"My mothers retirement home had a reservation for 30 people at Chompies  tomorrow.  The community called to confirm today and Chompies said they didn't see the reservation and they were to busy with TV stations coming to accommodate them.  The community even had the persons name that took the reservation.  There is a big promotion on tomorrow which they didn't even offer to provide them for a different date.  There are a lot of upset seniors. It's very sad, something they were all looking forward to!!"}
{"text":"I'm basing my review on my one experience there with a Pastrami sandwich. The pastrami was very good. I enjoyed the sandwich, fries and pickle very much. The price was reasonable.. 

The service was average.  We had to wait about 10 minutes to get seated, but we were also there during a peak time.

My wife and her friends go here quite a bit and they always enjoy the food, with no complaints."}
{"text":"There's really something for everyone at this Tempe kosher-style deli, which attracts a lot of ASU students and families due to its close proximity to campus You can get crepes, lox and cream cheese and herring along with pancakes, grilled cheese, a BLT or meatloaf. The choices seem endless and the menu is almost intimidating. And the prices? Cheap!"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices and a fun atmosphere. Everyone should come here at least once! Their breakfast is fab."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Jewish sliders and the ny pastrami are all I've tried bc they are so good. My wife gets the soup and it's the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"It's simply the best breakfast in Phoenix. Period. And the super friendly staff doesn't hurt."}
{"text":"The pickles are way to salty! Sandwiches are truly mile high! Tempe location is a bit smaller then the North Scottsdale location offering a younger crowd! Amazing desserts and pastries!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Chompies!!! They have such delicious sandwiches and a wide variety of other food. It's so great that they bring you complementary pickles while you wait for your lunch and they have a good section of more difficult to find sodas like root beer or cream soda. I have never been disappointed by the service I have had in the restaurant, and if you are looking to take something home like bagels or pastries, they also have a good sized bakery. Great food & great service, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"My very first (has been several times since) was awesome.  A friend took me there.  While waiting for the check, a waitress (that didn't even take care of us) told my friend and me to please wait.  We looked at each other wondering what was going on.  She came back with an envelope.  She explained to my friend that the last time he was there, he over paid! Mind you, this was over 3 months ago (according to him) since his last visit there.  Now THAT is impressive!  Anyone that is that honest and has ethics like that, the restaurant chose a great server!!

Since then, I have brought my son, mother (from out of town) and my friends there.  ALL love it! I even refer my customers who have come back telling me how awesome the experience and food was!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was average. Ordered turkey and dressing was ok. Side dishes were average. Chocolate chip cake was great. Will be back for deserts. Clean, low notice level"}
{"text":"I didnt know that Chompies was a Jewish deli when we decided to eat there, but honestly it was love at first kinsh! For a person who wasn't accustomed to the heritage's delicious treats there was a large variety for me to pick through so I didn't feel forced into only a few potatoe-based options! Their bakery was so good that I got out of my car as soon as I sat down to go back in and bring home more pastries(love the gluten free options)! Their staff is extremely helpful, they've made a regular out of me and my family."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times. The first two were just ok. Nothing to write home about, so to speak. So, my boyfriend and I went there yesterday around 11am. There was a 20 minute wait which we were ok with. When we get seated, the waitress was doing her part. She grabbed us some waters, but she put lemon inside my water, which I still don't get because I did not ask for lemon. We just asked if we could get bottled water. That was not a problem, but waiting 35 minutes for our food when I ordered bacon and eggs and my BF ordered eggs Benedict was a little irritating. . The people who sat down next to us got their food before we did and they came in after we had already ordered. I heard them order and they had two omelettes. Why was our food taking so long? When we finally did get our order, my plate had black all around it and I could wipe it off with my napkin. My BF's  food looked like a bagel with a runny mess poured all over it. I got up and walked out. I will never go back to a chompies location."}
{"text":"Have been eating here and the 92nd St location for years.  It's certainly not the best deli, but it's the best deli in Scottsdale and the surrounding area.  It's no Brent's or Jerry's but you take what you can get :)  OK, if you've had the mushroom barley soup at Brent's or the corned beef sandwich at Jerry's, you know what I'm talking about.

Very good matzo ball soup, LEO, brisket sandwich, chicken salad, and whole grain pancakes.  Decent corned beef, pastrami, and bagels.  The chopped liver isn't very good.  They don't have the best 'dinner' food, the dinner entrees are really hit and miss.  But for breakfast and lunch, it hits the spot.  The service is usually pretty good, even when its busy.

It's pricey, as is any good Jewish deli.  But the portions are hefty and worth the price."}
{"text":"I'm from New Jersey and have been looking for a good corned beef sandwich since I moved here to Phoenix. What I found at Chompie's was not good and I'm not sure it can even be classified as corned beef. While they offer extra lean for $2.00 extra making the sandwich $17.99, the fatty excuse for corned beef they provided at $15.99 wasn't good enough for a dog. Besides being extremely fatty (I certainly expect some, it's corned beef) this sandwich had zero flavor except that which was supplied by the rye bread. I have been to many delis in 60 years, and I have never experienced such a poor meal."}
{"text":"I love coming here, the food is great and the customer service is even better. I was in today and was served by Joe A at the bar, and he went above and beyond to ensure I had a great dining experience. I'll definitely come back because of their quality food and serive!"}
{"text":"We love chompies sliders and French toast as well as the eggs Benedict..... But only at the PV location. Hopefully the Arrowhead location gets better but we weren't impressed the 3 times we have them chances ... It taste like they use different oil and the staff isn't as attentive:("}
{"text":"Best deli in Phoenix... or really anywhere outside of New York. I've never had a bad experience with the food.

Food: The food is great, fresh, and plentiful. I've never ordered a dish and thought it was too small. They have the usual pastrami, corned beef, chicken liver, etc. I actually prefer some of their hot plate food though. The meatloaf is amazing, as is the chicken schnitzel. And the Chicken In The Pot with kreplach is perfect to cure the common cold.

Bakery: Even better. They have the baked goods that every displaced New Yorker misses - rainbow cookies, black and white cookies, red velvet cake, chocolate babka, and even halvah by the pound. Chompies also bakes their own bread and the challah is amazing. Plan to take some home. 

Take out: Always ready when promised, always hot when I pick it up.

Wait staff: If Chompie's has a weak spot, it is here. Some of their waiters are great, others are really bad at their work. There's really no way to predict this though."}
{"text":"Being a native New yorker perhaps I'm biased? I think the bagels aren't the quality I would like and there deli items seemed over priced in my opinion. I have been a few times so this isn't based on a one time situation. The bagels are better than Einstein's which honestly isn't saying much as they are terrible..

The staff was awesome.. the food just wasn't spectacular or comparable to New yorks..."}
{"text":"Delicious food but poor cleanliness.  The restrooms looked like they weren't cleaned in weeks!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST service we have had at any restaurant since having our son two years ago! Our server Chon (Sean) was extremely attentive to our wiggly toddler, giving him snacks before our meal came out without us even asking, talking to him, and bringing him a cookie to munch on while we finished paying. He was EXCELLENT and the food was delicious. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Dirty restaurants....broken bathrooms...most of the food is just ok. Just go to a Denny's if this is what you want and pay less. Otherwise Arizona has plenty of other much better breakfast restaurants to choose from. I guess when you have absentee owners or ones that cheap out...this is what you get. Go to the US Egg, Daily Dose, or Breakfast Club in Scottsdale instead."}
{"text":"We recently discovered Chompies In Chandler Az. Our first visit about two weeks ago went well and we very happy with the food and the service. We went back yesterday and have no idea what happened. Our food was terrible and service mediocure . When we arrived there was only one couple there. the soup special was Albondigas , a Mexican soup I have eaten and made many times in my life, so I was excited. I ordered the white fish salad half sandwich with soup and my son ordered the mile high Pastramie with fries. My meal: the fish salad was the worst I ever had. The consistency was like a cream cheese smear with no flavor just fishy and salty It was like they put every thing through a blender (Terrible). The bread was cold like it was prevously in a fridge. Worse than the sandwich was the soup. It had no  semblance to Albondigas except it had a meatball in it. It had a thick tomato base broth with potatoes and carrots. I even called the server to see if they had made a mistake. She said no that it was the Albondigas. I realize a Jewish deli may not be the best place for Albondigas but if they don't know how to make it they should not make it a feature soup of the day. That was my meal now for my sons meal. His Pastrami sandwich liked like a pyramid. Meat was all in the middle only to make it tall and none on the sides, made it only a third sandwich at best. The Pastrami was cold and dry. Again the bread was cold. Even worse the fries looked like they were left over, kinda grey looking and again cold. In addition there was only one couple there, already eating and it took 25 minutes to get our meal. I would never go back nor would I recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Being a former \"New Yawka\" I treasure my NY deli food.  With that being said, Chompie's used to be the only game in town.  This review is specific to the Scottsdale location. I would go back to the PV Mall location, but I'm all finished with the Scottsdale/Shea location.  The 4 of us went to eat, it was NOT busy. Our waiter, who had NO personality attempted to take our order. I asked for a corned beef on Kaiser roll. He told me they were 50 cents extra. I asked if he could please show me on the menu, where it said that, since it was not obvious to me and I couldn't see it.  I honestly didn't care about the 50 cents.  He said he doesn't know where on the menu it said that, but he knew it was there.  Ok, fine, I ordered my kaiser roll, prepared  to pay the additional cost, since that's how I like my sandwich.  I got up to take a walk over to the bakery, while our food was being prepared.  The manager, who was on duty that night, came up to my husband at our table and basically shoved the menu in HIS face to show him where it said there was an additional charge for kaiser rolls.  So when I got back from the table, he pointed it out to me. I then, took it upon myself to go up to the manager AND the server and I told them I was sorry, I wasn't trying to be petty, but my husband showed me where it said the additional charge on the menu. I apologized and told them I just couldn't find it, since it wasn't THAT obvious.  Well the freakin manager LAUGHED at me after I apologized!  Are you KIDDING me? How many restaurants actually have a customer who says they are sorry and then you are going to laugh at me? Apparently they have no idea that YELP is my newest obsession! I will NEVER go back to this location...EVER!  There are WAY better NY deli's in town now. Watch out Chompie's.....you have some new competition....thankfully!"}
{"text":"We (4 of us) came in on a Saturday afternoon! Our waitress Deanna was awesome! We ordered the Chompies slider challenge and shared it rather than trying to do time challenge! The sliders were outstanding! The onion strings were a good side order and we also ordered some fries! We all give this place 4 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The only thing worse than the garbage they are calling rye bread is the service. Just atrocious service each and every time"}
{"text":"If you're in the Tempe area and have that craving for a great \"Jewish Deli\", Chompie's is your place.  While the decor doesn't screen Jewish Deli, the food certainly does.  From their amazing fried matzah balls (never seen this anywhere before), to their famous Jewish sliders (brisket, cheddar, and a potato latke on a challah roll), our food was delicious.  Typical of other great regional delis, like Brents in the Los Angeles area, you get a tremendous amount of food, which justifies the higher prices.  They have a challenge to eat 12 of their sliders in 30 minutes for a free meal, which is crazy, since I couldn't finish the plate of 3 sliders taking my time.  Excellent choice of sides as well, and everything we had was incredibly fresh.  This is my new \"go to\" place while visiting the Tempe area."}
{"text":"I used to make the trip to Scottsdale to eat at Chompies and the food was always great. When they opened at Arrowhead Mall I was anxious to eat at one of my favorite restaurants, and wasn't disappointed. Yesterday, however, was another story. We were seated promptly and our waiter was professional, pleasant, no problem there. However the food was another story. I ordered a hot pastrami. It was tasteless and not good. When the waiter asked how I was enjoying my sandwich, I told him that something had changed and the pastrami \"wasn't horrible, but not good.\" He did offer to replace the sandwich, which I declined and he then offered an explanation. He told me that the meat was prepared fresh every morning and perhaps the cook forgot to season the meat. Seriously? I hope this was a one time thing and I will have to think about returning and spending another $16 on a sandwich, and hope the cook didn't forget the recipe. 
I hope that Chompies hasn't lowered the quality of their food in order to save money."}

had the huevos rancheros over the weekend. It was awesome! cute girls, great service. I like."}

probably like this place. Good service that's about it. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We visited at about 5pm on a Wednesday.  We were seated immediately, but there was a slight wait for a wait-person.  From there, I think the word \"wait\" is worth noting.  
We ordered our drinks-----although the menu stated that they had tonic, the server said they didn't and two of us settled for club soda instead.  The drinks came after about 20 minutes or so.  Then, we ordered  fairly simple  dinners:  a pastrami, a reuben and chicken strips.  
Mind you, the place was not particularly busy.  After about 35 minutes, a fella came out of the kitchen with our dinners and said he appreciated our patience.(All the time the server was no where to be found).  One meal(the reuben)was not as ordered, but after waiting so long we were afraid to send it back not knowing how long a replacement would take to be delivered.
On the plus side, the food was quite good, but the \"hot Pastrami\" was not hot...nor was the reuben.  Then, finally, comes the bill.  Surprise, surprise!!  The server was there to take the money.  When a complaint was delivered about not getting the reuben as ordered, the server took a little offense, but said that for the inconvenience we could pick out a dessert \"on the house\".  But, she could not bring it over.  We'd have to go to the counter to get it.  After waiting another 10 minutes after telling the counter person what the server had said, he just shrugged and said we'd have to \"wait our turn\".  I really think they had no intention of delivering on the promised dessert, but we'll never know.  We left,  Never again for the Tempe location!(Note:  We have not had this problem at 2 other locations)."}
{"text":"I really don't want to give a bad review of this place, but they don't seem to have the same standards for the take-out orders that they do for their dine-ins.

Dine ins are great, the food is always excellent. 

I've been ordering take out lately and there's always been a problem with my order. 

I get the Cabo skillet with homefries, and they keep not including the salsa and sour cream condiments. Today, I didn't get the melted jack cheese on my skillet, which completely killed the meal for me and was the last straw, which is why I'm writing this review. 

They also made my home fries hash browns instead, which were underseasoned and undercooked .

Quite a shame because I get nothing but the cabo skillet and its usually been excellent without any of these problems when I dine in. 

I ordered a different skilled and asked for scrambled eggs, instead I got overcooked fried eggs which also killed the entree. 


I'm going to give them another chance next week, and if the same problem presists I'll probably stop eating here again."}
{"text":"I took my out of town guest to the Arrowhead Chompie's since she had never eaten at a jewish deli.  She had the corned beef sliders and home fries and ate every bite.  I had my favorite, the Hollandaise covered eggs, swiss cheese, and fried, corned beef hash on potato pancakes. YUM!  I wish the waitress was around more so I could have reminded her sooner that I had ordered apple sauce. 
I had told her at the beginning that I would be ordering something to take home.  She remembered and asked for my take out order half way through our meal.  The mushroom, beef, and barley soup came fast & she included sliced, toasted bagels (their usual soup go-with).  When I asked for the check, it came promptly.  
Then I led my friend into temptation, the bakery section. First, you see special salads and cream cheeses and sliced meat and fish and bread and bagels. Then, around the corner, tastebud heaven. Cakes, eclairs, cookies, fudge brownies, oh my. Two tall cases filled with impossible choices.  The counter help let us know that at 3 pm one of the cases would go half price. He made us wait every minute of the time, though.  It seemed like he had a long day.  He had more energy and a better attitude the next week."}

{"text":"I cannot believe that a small box of about 25 cookies are $17.  They're just cookies. They never have been so much. What is Chompies thinking??  I just had breakfast there...coffee, eggs with corned beef, hash browns, bagel with cream cheese $17, Fair price.  I am just so disgusted over price gouging. I would think Chompies could provide a better price point on other items. Food and service are great,  just still in disbelief about cookie price...rising toward $20."}

{"text":"You really can't go wrong going to Chompies! The location on Shea is definitely a little slower service compared to the Tempe location but the food is the same.  It is not the most amazing food but it is still just what you are craving.  I love the matzo ball soup, not too salty just right!  I also love the fact that you can cram as many pickles in you mouth as possible, like an all you can eat pickle buffet! The best Jewish deli i have been to in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Chompie's is pretty awesome. They have a great menu with mile high sandwiches! Everything I've eaten from there has been great and the service has always been awesome as well. I love all of the pastries that they have, I had been looking for some decent cannoli's in Tempe for a while when I stumbled across this place. Definitely a great place to go for a sandwich or breakfast."}
{"text":"What is this world coming to? No salt bagels anymore? What will I put my pastrami and Swiss on? We've been coming to Chompies specifically for that sandwich since they opened their first deli at 32nd & Shea in the early '80s. Please say it ain't so."}
{"text":"I had to go to Payson and meet a buddy for work, he asked for me to stop at Chompies (Scottsdale) and get a corned beef on rye and a side of slaw. It sounded good so I called the order (for 2) into Paul, he asked me to give it 10 minutes, I gave him 30.
Went in, order not ready, in fact never placed, so I waited. First I paid, 2 sandwiches and a 2 sides of cole slaw, $33.00
Immediately I thought they placed an order for 4 sandwiches, nope 2. Since my buddy asked for them , I bit my tongue and proceeded to pay. 
When I received the plate, 2 cole slaw (plastic cup the size of a silver dollar) and 2 sandwiches that were about 3 inches high. I first assumed when paying for these special meals the meat would be piled very high, but no. Oh yes, and I got 2 slivers of pickles, limpy and very tasteless. Corned beef, not good, rye bread was ok, lots of holes allowing mustard to squize out everywhere and the cole slaw, just ok.
This isnt NYC or SF, $15.00 for a BS sandwich?
I know the word Jewish deli comes with all the other reviews, sorry, from New York, this place is a poor example of a Jewish deli."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here,  whatever you order will be amazing! Everything is fresh and tastes like its straight from NY. The pancakes are delicious and huge, its my go to order."}
{"text":"Pastrami is fabulous. Most flavorful and tender we've had. If you want a lean meat then don't go pastrami-ever!  We couldn't believe the generous portions. The matzo ball soup is a must try, unless you're not a fan of a dumpling style soup. We recommend the sweet potato fries and the potato salad. The coleslaw is good but we tend to like it a bit more vinegary than it was. My friend thinks it's a bit pricey, but I willingly pay a few extra bucks for food prepared fresh and not from a bag. And if you want fresh you'll love the garlicky pickles. Yum!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to a Chompies.  The menu is huge... it took forever to get through it.  The food tasted great, but they totally messed up my order.  When the waitress *finally* came over to check on us, I told her they messed it up, but by that time I'd already started eating it (we were on a time schedule... gotta go!).  She wanted to fix it, but since it took so long to get our food we didn't have time for them to 'fix' it.  The waitress did offer us a dozen (day old) bagels for the inconvience.

The bakery is extremely over priced for what you get.  Huge selection, but $2 for a sugar cookie that doesn't taste all that great... no thanks."}
{"text":"It has been a few years since I've been to a deli so I'm not sure where a $16 sandwich falls into the price range. However, I was really in the mood for a New Yorker and ordered one anyway. The sandwich arrived and I had a hard time seeing any coleslaw. I lifted the rye bread and was able to spot a smudge of it. My guess is that this is the least amount of coleslaw you can put on a sandwich and still list it as one of the ingredients. You could have dropped a piece of bread on the coleslaw bin and had more of it stick to the bread than was on my sandwich. This may seem like a lot of complaining about coleslaw, but that ingredient brings moisture to the sandwich and enhances the taste of the corned beef. I had pretty much the same problem with the dressing. Very little. A hunk of meat slapped onto a piece of bread is not my idea of a sandwich. In the end, what I received for my $16 was a small, dry, mediocre-tasting sandwich. 

If this is typical New-York style food I suggest we start sending care packages to the poor, starving people of the Big Apple. They have to be starving.

On the positive side, the staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Went for lunch to grab a sandwich to go.  The guy helping us behind the counter was obviously stoned.  My husband ordered a turkey sandwich and when we opened it up, it was literally turkey and bread.  Nothing else!  It was kind of funny, if he hadn't been hungry.  Actually, its still kind of funny."}
{"text":"We live near the Chompie's at the PV mall and usually walk over on Friday's to get something from the bakery to take home. The baked goods are tasty but the service has left us sour on Chompie's. On several occasions we have been right at the register and been ignored, not because they are short handed , but because the staff is chatting with each other and not paying any attention to customers. 

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"So having landed at Phoenix Sky Harbour and waiting for my connection out to Prescott, I was asked very nicely if I as a lone traveller would consider being bumped off the flight to allow a guy to get back home to see his sick kid. I was more than happy to oblige and as I'm out her for 6 weeks or so an extra few hours really don't mean that much. So with a $30 gratuity from the airline I thought, what shall I do?

An then the idea occurred to me that I wasn't all that far from Chompies deli in Scottsdale, a place I've wanted to try for a while.  I hopped in a cab an headed into deepest darkest Phoenix!

So Chompies is a New York style Deli and I believe they now have 4 venues in the Phoenix area., I wanted to visit this one as its the only one I'd ever known anyone visit. This place was made a little famous when it featured on Man v Food. Id' heard about it prior to that show but it was seeing on there that planted the seed for me to actually make an effort to go.

Okay, this on appearance is just a regular deli and on entry I was greeted warmly. I was shown to a booth and presented with the menu.
Now when you look around the place you soon realise that the portion sizes are generous even by US standards.

The menu has plenty of choice sandwiches, burgers bagels and traditional Jewish food too. There's also a kids menu which I have to say sounded pretty good and there was a dedicated gluten free menu too.

I picked Bobs Brisket from the Colossal Reubans section of the menu priced at $14.99 you would be forgive for thinking its a little pricey. However when it arrives it is huge, and I mean huge! It was full of flavour, tender meet, perfect onions and beautiful seasoning.
Having seen the size of it I was glad I didn't order a side of wedges billed on the menu as 'full portion sides'.

Chompies is the home of Chompies slider challenge which was featured on Man v Food. Its essential 12 sliders filled with brisket, mini potato pancakes and Jack cheese served with gravy and 5lbs of onion strings. Many have tried few have succeeded. At $39.95 its actually pretty good value, and would certainly be worth having as a sharer.

I loved this place, the food was great, the atmosphere great and the prices reflected excellent value, my sandwich and a coke came to $22 (inc tip)."}
{"text":"Great food! Huge portions!  kosher! Gluten free too! Anthony was our waiter and he provided excellent service!"}
{"text":"I go out a lot... my fridge consists of Lea & Perrin Worcester Sauce and bottled water... so when I say this place had one of the BEST breakfast places... it is my favorite meal of the day and I think I've tried EVERY breakfast joint in AZ.
I think I have tried everything on the menu, but I have to say if I had to pick just one... it would be the corned beef hash.  The lunch and dinner menu has so many choices that I've been here at least a 100 times and I don't think I've ordered the same thing twice. Everything is a standout, but if I had to say what menu item would a new customer not leave without trying... is the Matzo Ball soup!! Absolutely the best I've had (sorry grandmother!).
I've been to the other 3 locations and they are all great with wonderful service and quality food. The Scottsdale location decor is probably a little drab while the other locations are more updated, but the location is superb and easy to find."}
{"text":"I love Chompies. Their food is always good especially the latkes and the breakfast anything. They aren't very good at caramelizing onions but most of the time they get my order right."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. We come to Chompies most Sundays and have always had GREAT meals until the past 2 visits. The last time we went here, my boyfriend ordered The Breakfast of Champions with two whole wheat pancakes and when they brought out the pancakes, we noticed that they were significantly smaller than usual. Furthermore, we had seen other customer's pancake orders that went out with huge pancakes. We said something to our waitress and they brought out new full-sized pancakes, which was no big deal. We just ate there tonight for dinner and both of our meals were not up to the usual Chompies standard. I ordered the sweet potato pancakes, and the bottom pancake was completely burnt. My boyfriend ordered the all-you-can-eat chicken and dumplings, and for some reason they had smashed the dumplings down into the dish, which they've never done when he's ordered that before. Then on his 3rd round of the chicken and dumplings, they gave him such a skimpy portion of dumplings that it didn't even cover the bottom of the dish. Even worse than that, instead of giving him a chicken breast they put sliced turkey on the dumplings! I'm not sure what's been going on at this Chompies location lately, but we've never had any problems at the other location on Cactus Road."}
{"text":"This place has officially become my Thursday brunch place of choice! I've been getting the everything bagel with garlic herb cream cheese to go and a drink paying only $5! I pay later with terrible breath but its super delicious. My friends like the jalapeno cream cheese, but I'm not a fan. Next time Im thinking I might try another flavor. They have a wide range of flavors from spicy to sweet or even plain. I've only at in the dining area one time over a year ago but I don't remember the food or service so Ill review that another time. The lady who prepares the bagels on the other hand is really nice. But if you dont like a ton of cream cheese be sure to ask for light cream cheese."}
{"text":"Just OK. Bakery items are very good. But the restaurant -meats are dry, sides blah, dinner entrees just not good at all. Latkes - cardboard."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for 2-3 times per week for over 30 years. Chompies is an institution in Arizona that has kept their NY deli charm and authenticity. This is my first review on Yelp and just wanted to share how much I LOVE the food, the atmosphere and the people that work there."}
{"text":"By far and away the best breakfast place in Arizona. All of their locations have great service, great prices and true east coast diner food. And don't forget to try their baked goods. Fresh and delicious. Get the bialy instead of the bagel"}
{"text":"This place is worth the higher price tag. When you first arrive, your interest is peaked by the delicious treats in the bakery cases. Once you review the menu it's hard to decide if you want a massive omelette, huge pancakes, or a perfect deli sandwich, or all of the above? The staff is always very kind. The owner even came around and checked on us and thanked us for coming in. They even gave my young son a \"treat\" (cookie) while I was walking around with him. I highly recommend this place. We always make sure to stop here on our visits."}
{"text":"We attempted to visit this location a final and third time as we have never had issues with other locations.  As we arrived at 10:30 am on Saturday morning the lobby was partially full.  We noticed immediately that there were tables open inside and they had additional seating on patio.  The hostess took our name for two and told us it would be 15 minutes.  During the half hour we waited we observed a number of customers finish meals and leave the restaurant.  With his happening we expected to be seated within the 15 minutes the hostess had quoted.  After waiting for 30 minutes and only six people being seated and we saw 8 tables now available and we were concerned.  We overheard the hostesses discussing the kitchen needing more time before they could seat customers.  This was when we decided to leave.  We seem to experience this at each time we have tried this location.  We will not return to this location."}
{"text":"I love chompie's,  I have been to all the locations except arrowhead until today. I'm very disappointed, the sweet and sour cabbage soup didn't compare to the other locations and I ordered the half a rueben with it and while the pastrami was great as usual, the sandwich had half the meat I'm used to from all other chompie locations. I don't think I will return to this location again.  Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Always too much food!  Try the chicken finger wrap with ranch. Yum!  Pierogies are huge too and well worth it!"}
{"text":"Its everything I everyone said it was going to be...GOOD!  I liked their breakfast and the coffee was pretty good too.  The service was excellent to boot.  Try it and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice now and each time I leave feeling less than satisfied.  My most recent visit was even worse than the first. 
I realize that everyone has good days and bad, but to muck up a grilled cheese sandwich is inexcusable.
I ordered a regular bowl of soup (the menu only offered two bowl sizes, no option for a cup, which would have been my preference) and a grilled cheese with bacon sandwich. The waitress asked me what kind of cheese I wanted and she wrote it down.  The soup arrived first and had great flavor. The sandwich arrived about 10 minutes later and the bread was not grilled and inside there was no cheese, just the bacon.  I sent it back and it came back with warm, but not melted, cheese. The kitchen had at least grilled the bread the second time around. In my opinion, this place is greatly overrated. A grilled cheese sandwich with bacon shouldn't be that difficult to get right. I won't be going back for a third experience in spite of the waitresses attempt to appease me by offering me a free dessert.  That is the only reason I didn't give Chompie's a one star rating."}
{"text":"Great food at another Chompies location! Friendly service beautiful atmosphere huge bar .Bakery items are as yummy as they look. Can't wait to try everything on this menu ! Had corn beef on rye yum and the pickles"}
{"text":"Best bakery in town! Feels like new York"}
{"text":"I've been to this location, the one in Scottsdale, and the original Tempe location,  they have the best pastrami I've ever had. The sweet and sour cabbage soup is amazing. The service is very good. I go here anytime I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is our second convention in Phoenix, at a nearby hotel. All of us New Yorkers love coming to Ciampi's even though we get similar food in New York metropolitan area. Their pastrami is heavenly. They make a good egg cream, and have an outstanding bakery. The staff is always happy to accommodate large parties, and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"A review update. Chompies claims to make a call to a message they receive in 24 hours. I have messaged them 3 times since the 16th, no answer. I want to add a note now to the post I made on the 17th about items I purchased to bring home the fateful day of the luncheon. 
Besides the pound of Salami I threw out, I had bought a block of Halavah and it was tasteless and seemed old. Also a large bag of bagel chips that was all end pieces overly toasted and so large you could not bite in to them. And 1/2 LB of tuna salad that was dry and tasteless. Not sure what is happening to this Chompies but they obviously don't care. RUN don't walk from going there."}
{"text":"The bagels are good, especially the egg sandwich on a bagel. Let's get that out of the way. If you eat meat and you're here for the bagels, go for it.

I'm a vegetarian. I like the egg and cheddar on a toasted bagel without meat. On 5 separate occasions spread out over a couple months in a row, I ordered the egg and cheddar on a bagel. Every time, they added bacon to it. A few times, they just tried to pull the bacon off the cheese (with little bits of bacon embedded in it still). The first time I had to call the manager and have it refunded on my card. He promised it wouldn't happen again.

The next time, I checked in the car before I walked out. Bacon.

The next three times, I checked in the store AND asked the cashier to please go tell the chefs not to put bacon on it. All three times, they put bacon on the sandwich. Are you kidding me??

I really don't think they're intentionally deciding to put bacon on a sandwich that they know is intended for a vegetarian. I think they just don't pay attention and don't care. And apparently the manager and cashier don't care either. I'm definitely one to give many chances to fix a mistake, but clearly this is just the attitude of this place. It's a bummer - I like the bagels better than Einsteins and other local shops, but how can I endorse a place that's either disrespectful to me or vegetarians?"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with our family last night....horrible.  I have been going to Chompies for 15 years and have done over 1k in catering a year for 8 years.  First time at this location.  We ordered 2 cold sandwiches and some sliders from the deli counter.  We spent over 50$ for that food and my wife grabbed a glass of wine from the bar.  Even though they had 10+ open tables, and we spent 60$, we were told we could not sit in the dinning area, and instead had to sit at the dirty, unclean tables with busy mall traffic walking by.  It took over 40 minutes for our food to come.  The sliders were cold, and worst we have had at Chompies.  While we waited for a long time, and were not able to sit in a clean unused area, I did more work walking back and forth from the fountain machine to refill the 2oz Dixie cup they gave me for water than the 2 workers behind the counter.  Apparently if they give you a bigger cup for water, it will cost them a lot.  We were treated very poorly and will never go back. This company used to be good, but it seems they are all about the money now, and definitely not the customers.  After recommending this place for the last 15 years, I will now steer them away.  Go spend half the money somewhere else, you will b treated better, save money, and get the same food if not better in a shorter period of time."}
{"text":"Responded to a promotion of theirs that excluded \"holidays\".  This was Dec. 24 which is the day BEFORE a holiday, yet they refused to honor the promotion on the basis that Dec. 24 is a holiday.  Had to wait for a table even though there seemed to be plenty available.  Service was slow and the food was mediocre plus they forgot my side dish.  Very disappointing because we had heard such good things about this place."}
{"text":"This place is good. Love the potato pancakes. I like the New York style. The one in Chandler is newer but just as cute inside. The Jewish sliders are a treat."}
{"text":"I'm not Jewish, by means and look. But I do have few friends who are.
I'm not an expert on kosher food either.. but my friends will tell you that I do love good food and have a great appetite.

I've heard my friends talk of this place many times.
and at last, I was able to join them one summer day.

my first impression was that the place was big and busy. good sign so far.
their menu, which I did not take the time to look over page after page of all the items they featured, was extensive.
however, knowing what we were going to get, we ordered full order of corn beef sandwich (very popular) with potato salad and side of onion rings.

corn beef sandwich was huge... which we split. that was a better size.
the meat was tender and juicy... but perhaps little heavier cut than their usual, according to my friend. their potato salad was tasty, but it was a little sweeter than I was accustomed to. and their onion was thin like calamari, heavier on the breading... probably just a commercial version, not home made, according to my friend. I prefer mine to be thick cut with light and crisper coating.

I'm not sold on the place but it was clean and decent.
I may give it a try one more time and see how they measure up than."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They have a 4$ weekday breakfast that will never beat anywhere.  The sandwiches are huge and the soups are delicious too.  You can't go wrong ordering anything here."}
{"text":"If this is the best \"Kosher Style\" deli that Phoenix has to offer, then it's good. When compared with other deli's I've rated in New York, Las Vegas and Detroit... It's Meh to poor. Pastrami was too fat, pickles too salty. Decent sized sandwich priced a little high."}
{"text":"Normally, I give Chompies top marks.  The food is always excellent but the service is really lacking during dinner service lately.  Tonight I went by to have a salmon dinner.  It was excellently cooked and I received it in a timely manner after waiting nearly 15 minutes to order it.  My waiter, Matt had to be told that I was waiting in his section.  He never refiilled my drink... the hostess did that.  He put my check in front of me halfway through my dinner.  Didnt ask if I would like desert until he saw me writing
 this review. Lovey, what's going on at Chompies?  The wait staff in the evenings is horrible lately.  PV Mall location"}
{"text":"My Wife and I have been hearing about this place, we used to work right next door, and seen it on TV. So after 9 yrs we go and try it for breakfast. We are enjoying the food, service was great.SO WHY THE 1 RATING. A NASTY ROACH CRAWLED ACROSS MY TABLE. I was done!!!"}
{"text":"I like their menu. Great breads and bagels. Pricing is a little high for their sandwiches. Deserts are fantastic. Will go back."}

Greasy noisy expensive questionable quality rude."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The service can be hit or miss, but the consistency of the food is outstanding.  If you are a soda drinker...they do have soda sitting in pitchers which causes it to go flat in my opinion, and I am not fond of the overuse of iceberg lettuce in their salads, but there are plenty of other options.  Matza ball soup...better than my grandmothers (shhhhh don't tell her I said that!!)  And the best way to end my meal is with one of their delicious rainbow cookies.  Thanks Chompies for being a restaurant I trust!"}

{"text":"I was disappointed with the chicken soup that apparently doesn't come with any chicken? Had to ask server for some. Took almost 15 minutes and by then my soup was cold. Virtually no broth just noodles and nice sized carrots. I think its way to pricy for what you actually get."}
{"text":"i ordered it through door dash in the late afternoon and it as still awsome! i got a couple random bagles with different cream cheeses! homemade everything i can tell. best cream cheese ever! the only down fall is the price...lil expensive for sandwiches and breakfast. but overall this will be my new go-to bagle place from now on!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow. We had to wait about 45 min for our food and restaurant was not busy. Food was over priced. $16 for a sandwich is not really reasonable even if it was piled high with meat."}
{"text":"Excellent gluten free options with a staff and kitchen that are knowledgable about food prep. Reasonable prices and literally something for everyone on this enormous menu. I had the gluten free petite waffles and they were perfect!"}
{"text":"I used to love Chompies no more. I got served yet another overly fatty, overly salty corned beef sandwich that was nothing but a mound of crumbly fatty meat. Where is Robert Irvine when u need him?"}
{"text":"This is not very far from my home, but for some strange reason, I have never visited there.  Maybe because we don't have New York Deli's in Spokane, and I'm not familiar with the idea.

The other day, I agreed to meet my son and little granddaughter there for coffee and a bagel, and found that it is much more than just a bagel stop.  They actually have a restaurant with quite an extensive menu.  I had breakfast - the choices were very diverse - including skillets, various pancakes, bagels (of course), french toast, omelets, and a number of other items.  The servings were large, and the service very prompt and friendly.  Most importantly, the prices were more than reasonable.

The only thing that I disliked, was that they did not have hash browns.  They do have potatoes as an option with the meals, but you cannot actually classify them as hash browns.  They are good - but not quite a replacement for hash browns and gravy.

I actually like it so much, that I stopped and had breakfast two days later on the way to the golf course.  Again, great breakfast at very reasonable prices.  Although I usually don't eat lunch, I am going to have to make an effort to stop in and try their lunch menu. And their deli counter, and all the different varieties of bagels."}
{"text":"First visit to Chompies at this location. So happy that we have a Chompies in the West Valley. Husband had half pastrami sandwich which was piled high. He could barely finish the sandwich. I opted for a grilled cheese and tomato on sourdough which was grilled perfectly. Service was very attentive. Sodas were replenished without having to request them and extra half sours were provided as well. We decided to buy dessert to take home. Lemon bar was delicious and the Brooklyn 7 layer cake reminded me of my childhood on the east coast. Will definitely return."}

Thank you for going above and beyond to put a big smile on his face!"}
{"text":"Maybe the best lunch anywhere, the Jewish sliders were tender and moist. The Pastrami on rye was delish. Coffee and linger tart were great"}
{"text":"I just went there for mother's day (for take-out bagels). The bagels, somehow, were overcooked... almost stale.  The potato salad was horrible (very sweet).

It was depressing because I avoided Einsteins for this place."}
{"text":"So good.  I went to New York in the late nineties when I was still a no-nothing teenager and did not take advantage of the delis.  When I see a place like this that serves New York deli food out west, I make sure I visit.  I ordered the hot pastrami on rye with a side of clam chowder.  This pastrami was legit.  It was tender and spiced excellently.  And there was so much of it.  After a few bites I abandoned the silly notion that I could pick up the entire thing and get it into my mouth.  I had to go knife and fork.  Whatever it takes to deliver the asset.  

I'm only visiting Phoenix and I have a limited amount of time to explore the area.  I might have to re-visit Chompie's before I leave and forsake the opportunity to try something else.  It was that good."}
{"text":"Chompies is not a bad place to grab a bite if you desperately want deli and desperately want to spend a lot of money.  The food is pretty standard (despite man vs. food's claims) but it is a little on the pricey side for what you get.  The bagels are pretty good, and they have a large variety, but many of the things on their menu are pretty meh.  Most of their breakfast food is on par with Denny's or ihop. Nothing special.  Their sandwiches are ok, but I haven't had a whole lot of them, just a couple.  I'm really in no hurry to eat anymore. It'll do if you really must have deli, but don't think you're going to get Carnegie quality knish. This place gets 3 stars for bagels, and 2 stars for everything else... Except coffee.  Coffee gets negative 2 stars at chompies. It tastes like a broken thermometer no joke. Sewage coffee blech!!!!"}
{"text":"It's hit or miss with the staff!! Food is good but service lacks!!!"}
{"text":"$27 for breakfast? Manager not helpful.

Although it is not in my neighborhood, I've been trekking to Chompies for years. I like the baked goods and New York Deli menu. 

Saw a coupon in the local paper for breakfast \"buy one breakfast ($7.99 or greater) and get the 2nd breakfast free.\"  This reminded me that I was overdue for a trip to Chompies. An out-of-town houseguest was the perfect reason to go back.

We presented the coupon upon ordering our food. The server said \"hang on to that (coupon.)\"  He said that other people had trouble with the fine-print terms of the coupon. He cautioned us to order only items at or above $ 7.99.  We had done our homework and chose dishes off the menu priced at $10.99 and $8.99.  Aside from that, I ordered one small juice and my friend one coffee.

The food was delivered quickly. The bagels were great.

When the server left the bill at the table ($27) I reminded him about the coupon and asked him to recalculate the bill.  He returned with the same bill, saying that \"one of our dishes was a special, and therefore it was not eligible for the coupon discount.\"  We asked to see a manager. 

The manager came to our table and listened to our plea. He did not say much. He took the coupon and said \"let me see if your server has closed out this bill.\"  After 10 minutes, our server came back with $4 and said \"it's all settled guys, here you go.\" 

That makes no sense, we were owed $8.99.  Not $4.  

So...prices too high...attitude is wrong...I won't go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"I frequent this place a lot. This morning I took my Grandpa for breakfast. The food I would give 3.5 to 4 stars. Nothing spectacular but good. Its hard to mess up breakfast. The reason Im rating this place 5 stars is for the service. Chompie's is always very busy, especially today. Our server Laura though was the best. She was very nice, attentive to detail, and polite. Its hard to find service like this and considering a college town makes it that much better. A handful of great breakfast spots in tempe, but because of the service I will still make this one my go to!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is OMG delicious and the service is great. I eat here all the time and its a little slice of home. If you like New York food this is the place for you I highly recommend this place for breakfast, lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"We have been frequenting Chompies, and specifically this location for more than a year now.  Up until the past 2 months, it has been great - great food - great service.  And they have been consistently good.  These past 2 months have had a negative change.  The food orders are very inconsistent - quality is reduced - though the service remains high.  This all culminated this week where our food was the worst I have seen.  The grilled cheese was not cooked and didn't include the tomato - a standard ingredient.  The slider was cold and when asked for a new one, I think they just reheated the same one.  The tea had an odd chemical taste.  The server was really great and removed some of the food.  But it was a wholly disappointing experience.  We may take a long break from Chompies - and that is sad because we really like the food and experience.  We may try another location - but we probably won't be back to PV."}
{"text":"Chompies is hands down the best deli in Phoenix metro. They have the best bagels and their sandwiches are awesome!! The service for take out and to go's could use some help tho"}
{"text":"Chompie's has really good food and a huge menu!  They are really close to ASU and seem to busy all of the time.  They have breakfast, lunch and dinner options. 

They start you with a bowl of homemade pickles.  Not a fan, but my friends really like them.  I really like their pastrami and corn beef sandwiches and sliders.  I usually go for the sliders and a salad so I can split it with someone.  The prices are too high, especially for someone in college, so splitting a meal here is do-able based on the portion sizes and price."}
{"text":"They put so much cream cheese on the bagel that you can barely taste the bagel. And I'm okay with that."}
{"text":"Not for the faint of heart or appetite or the New York Deli purist. 

We arrived late on a Sunday morning and the wait was not too long and fairly orderly. The menu at this place is huge, which I liked. While we waited, we perused the bakery case where there were a variety of delicious looking pastries. 
The big thing here apparently is the Jewish slider, and I had to try it because, where else am I going to get such a thing? I ordered the gravy on the side and thoroughly relished two out of the 3 velvet brisket,crisp latke, j ack cheese and gravy sandwiches on homemade challah rolls. They were quite tasty but I cannot believe anyone could eat 12 of these things to get on the wall of fame, or whatever it is. 
My sweetie had a fantastic bacon omelet with a jalapeno cheddar bagel. They do have salted caramel cream cheese which is just too weird for me, but BF enjoyed his  bagel with plain cream cheese and house potatoes in case there was a serious carb shortage. . 
Service was sweet, iced tea refills kept coming. Only problem was our server brought the check before asking if we wanted dessert....we had to grab some of the sweets to go and ,although eye appealing, the cannoli  were not the highlight of the meal. 

I do have a question though? How do you explain all the lovely young and thin Arizona State students ensconced in booths eating mammoth portions of food? How does that work? I could not eat here often, or they would be wheeling me out , but definitely worth a trip for the \"Jewish\" sliders."}
{"text":"Had a really unpleasant dining experience tonight. I've eaten here many times and it's been fine. I write this tonight hoping that a manager will read this and take corrective action. First - I had to wait 20 minutes and when I was seated the restaurant was empty except for about 4 tables. this was before 7 pm. 
Second when I ordered the waiter told me they were out of pastrami. How does a deli run out of pastrami?? Especially when at least half of t)e items on the menu contain pastrami!
Third mthe corned beef i got instead was so fatty and tough it was hard to eat.
Fourth I had to wait half an hour after I finished eating to have my plate cleared and get a check. 
Fifth when I left at about 7:50 they had locked the front door and wanted me to go out into their very dark parking lot through a side door. There were several other tables still eating but they turned out the lobby lights after I left - closing time is at 8. 
Last the staff - while not really rude - had NO interest in the customers. They blew everything off, didn't speak except to tell me the front door was locked (one girl said it wasn't and opened it for me). They made it abundantly clear that they could care less about their work- and I am a very uncrabby easy-going diner.
Oh, yeah, and the bagels I bought to bring home were hard as a rock.
It will be a LONG time before I return."}
{"text":"The 2-star rating is due to the HORRENDOUSLY high prices for anything on the menu.

Price:  it's 250% of what you'd expect to pay.  A $5 sandwich will easily cost you $18.  A very hard thing to get over, regardless of Service or Taste.

Service:  Excellent, and I wonder if they're happy because they expect tips, above and beyond what you're paying for the food.  20% of a normal $5 is ok, but 20% of $75 is probably why they're smiling.  *** Please correct your prices so families can enjoy your family restaurant ***.

Taste:  Excellent.  I appreciate your taking lunchmeat and putting it onto my sandwich.  I just have trouble giving you 10 times the price of the lunchmeat.

I'd seen the Man vs. Food episode, so I was excited to eat their food.  I was just stunned to silence by the horribly high prices.  I just couldn't believe the cashier would ask for that much money with a smile on her face.  Now I know why they never mention prices on the show."}
{"text":"Seriously you can't go wrong at Chompie's. Breakfast? Sure! Get anything!! Lunch? Why not! Make sure you are prepared to eat the mount Everest of sandwiches. Dinner? Ok! Bring it on! 
I always get breakfast and I am never disappointed. Stop by the bakery for some of the best lace cookies ever. Just don't go without your appetite!"}
{"text":"Giving 1 star was very easy.  They practically begged me to do it.  We arrived at 2:15. Sign on door says they'll be closing at 5 pm. First thing I thought was they allow their employees to watch the Super Bowl.  How nice!  Wrong. Turns out they would be closing in 2 hours and 45 minutes for a private party. Read on, because that point becomes relevant.  

The young hostess (she knows who she is AND so does the manager) walked us back to the very last section of the restaurant to a booth.  We passed other sections filled with people. Not over-crowded, though, as it was 2:15 pm.  The booth had a large pitcher of tea and two large pitchers of water on the back of it, right where my head, HAIR, and shoulders would be literally inches away.  I told her I wasn't comfortable with that and I'd like to sit elsewhere. There was an empty booth 2 seats away.  She scowled at me. \"I have no where else to put you. We are full.\"  Really?  What about there?  \"Everything else is reserved\".    Everything?????   \"Yes, everything\".  

So we left.  I called the manager from my car.  He apologized and asked us to come back.  He said HE, TOO is uncomfortable with drink pitchers being placed by his customer's hair, but he is a new manager so he's let it go.   He also said she should never have refused to seat us elsewhere. Props to him for not being rude like his front-line greeter. 

Chompie's only gets one chance to be rude to us, so we declined to come back.  The treatment by the NASTY hostess, as well as the GROSS practice of storing open drinks where any customer's hair could dangle (Health Department, are you reading this?) was such a turn-off that I think the experience is worthy of sharing."}
{"text":"Deli and cakes were alright, but the highlight here is the sliders. Get the slider appetizer with any other meal, and it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"Yes, I came in @ 7:35 on a Sunday evening (hours say 8pm). I was sent to the deli to put in my take out order. I was ignored (plenty of eye contact, but not even the courtesy to say they were closing early). Instead, some dude swearing about sweeping the floor. Seriously, wouldn't have killed someone to say they were closing or perhaps lock the door?"}
{"text":"Is it me or do you get more food at this Chompie's?  My plate was huge and it was full.  I got my usual - cabbage rolls with potato pancake.  Normally I am able to finish this entire plate at the Paradise Valley and Tempe locations.  

The cabbage roll was a bit sweet and the potato pancake was dry.  I tried my friend's home fries and it didn't have much flavoring.  The glazed carrots were tasty though.  It was my first visit so maybe I should have tried the matzo ball soup instead."}
{"text":"Must have been a bad day there today.  Awful dinner.  \"Steamed broccoli\" was frozen on the inside.  Gross!  Meatloaf was mostly bread, dry, and without flavor and mashed potatoes were cold.  I ordered \"chicken schnitzel\".  Same frozen broccoli.  Chicken was flavorless, over cooked and dry-- I had to ask for sauce  or gravy because it was so bad.  Server was not sympathetic and did not alert the manager.  I would have expected an apology from the manager or some consolation.  By the way, this was 4:45 on a Sunday afternoon so it was not too busy to pay attention to quality.  Lastly, we didn't order beverages and the price was still $31 for two \"dinners\"....Pathetic for value.  Will give it a chance again for breakfast but dinner or lunch is a \"no go\"!"}
{"text":"The food was great. The waitress was very attentive and stopped by several times to check on us. I had the pastrami Reuben and can I say it was delicious. The pastrami was overflowing from the sandwich and the sauce was very Tangy and good. I wish we had a Chompies in my home town. I will definitely be back when we come to visit the family. By the way the sliders are AMAZING too. And how can you pass up the deli case on the way out without getting a cannoli.....Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Beef brisket sliders were AMAZING! French dip was delcious! The au jus sauce was very flavorful. The bakery was fabulous! The cannoli was perfect. When you first seated they give you a dish of pickles and cucumbers and a basket of a variety of breads."}
{"text":"Chompies, always great food. So happy they are finally on the West Side. 
Food was great, overcharged for soup as it should have been $2.99 for a bowl with my sandwich but realized when I got home I was charged $5.49. Waiter was not very good.
Wendy B was there and introduced herself and welcomed us. Best Chopped Liver in town."}
{"text":"We are Chompies fans, we frequent the Paradise Valley location...I have never been to this location, I ordered my usual mile high pastrami and my wife ordered her usual Monte Cristo sandwich. Upon being the food to the table we found no maple syrup with the Cristo sandwich and my marble rye on my mile high was firm not soft...this was a huge disappointment for me. I hardly think spending $88 plus a tip for a firm marble rye was worth the wait, there was also no lox prices that I could bring home from the deli, another disappointment...on the positive side my in laws had no complaints. I will not be visiting the Tempe location anytime soon and can't wait to get back to the PV store !

{"text":"Food is good but hollandaise sauce was cold on my Guanajuato Benny!! Server was not very attentive or nice :(....other times that I been here for breakfast the sercice is awesome so I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Ordered \"Rare Roast Beef\" straight from the menu and it came out well done. Told my server, he came back from the kitchen and told me \"we actually don't have rare roast beef.\" How do you call yourself a deli?"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches! Long on delicious meat. Short on bread. You could make a meal out of their pickles. Matzo soup is fantastic. Service is impeccable."}
{"text":"We went there yesterday a I enjoyed it. The atmosphere was fantastic, because they had a tv, plus they have a lot of pictures of Man V. Food, when Adam Richman came here. The service is good, because they waited for us to order, and were very patient.   I ordered the Jewish Slider like Adam did, but I didn't take the challenge. 1 order of Jewish SIiders are 3 sliders. The sliders were awesome. The meat was tender and really juicy. The cheese didn't really make a difference, it just added a little flavor, but the bun soft and chewy, and buttery which tasted like pancakes without syrup, and it was fresh. The potato pancakes put the lid on the jar. The potato pancakes aren't just a creative idea, it was very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. There are 3 reasons why this isn't a normal slider. Reason number one is the Potato Pancakes, reason number two is the meat isn't a patty, and grinded beef that made that slider interesting. Reason number three is that the cheese is melted. REALLY melted. I will go again, because the sliders are amazing."}
{"text":"The service was good. We had a great waitress and food wait wasn't to long. They come out with the store bought loaf of chocolate cake bread? I don't know what it's called, but it is not needed, nor is it that good. We wait a normal amount of time for the food, but when the food comes out is when the problems start. I order the corn beef hash scrambler, with bacon and a Belgian waffle. The corn beef hash is a joke. The side of potatoes that comes with it looks like it was a whole potato that was smashed in the grill then chopped up, mixed in with some prepared frozen potatoes. The corn beef hash it's self is one of the most disappointing breakfast items I have ever ordered. They put two pieces of semi-melted kraft American singles. The corn beef itself was gritty and tasteless. My waitress was nice and took awhile form me and took it off the bill. Speaking about the bill... $23 including tip. I got a large orange juice, waffle, and a side of bacon.m. I can't understand why it cost so much for mediocre food. Don't go here, save your money. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Chompies was a one time favorite of mine.  As a native New Yorker I am always looking for good deli food. My son and I stopped in for breakfast and were sadly disappointed.  Firstly they were out of corned beef hash.  Have you seen the breakfast menu?  It's 75% corned beef hash!  How do you allow this to happen? Latkes another favorite of mine, had so much flour in it that it was difficult to see the shreded potato. The bialy was gummy, doughy pale and  thick. I admit I ate the entire mess because I was starving and didn't have the time to go elsewhere. I have never experienced this at chompies.  Nor have I ever complained about the prices before. I will pay anything for good food. When I decide to dine out I eat well! The service was good and fast. The staff were kind and responded with sincere concern. I may try chompies again but I am reluctant. Sad, it was a great place."}
{"text":"Be prepared for rich, salty, fatty, huge portions; a heart attack on a plate for those on restricted diets and a delectable feast for those seeking to satisfy a robust meat and potatoes appetite!"}
{"text":"Had my doubts about this place, but man, they menu offered a large verity of all the things I liked. The salmon was outstanding, the omelet was really good.
 Their bakery service kinda sucked. We kept pointing at what we wanted, which was a large chocolate covered strawberry and plain cannoil, but they gave us a different chocolate covered strawberry, and chocolate covered cannoil  because they thought it was better... WE DID NOT LIKE THAT!"}
{"text":"Wow...have been a fan of Chompie's for years now. But with our experiences yesterday...don't think I'll be going to the Shea Scottsdale location anymore - it's a shame too because the place is a 5 minute walk from me.

*Disclaimer: review is based on service only. I know a lot of people are sticklers for customer service, especially when the place is good, not great. Usually, great food overshadows poor service. But Chompie's is good/maybe great food in comparison to other Phoenix restaurants and delis...definitely not great food compared on a larger, metropolitan scale.

We were traveling from Chicago to Phoenix yesterday and were wondering what we would be eating for Christmas dinner considering we had no food at home. We called Christmas Day afternoon before our flight took off to confirm holiday hours and menu offerings and the woman who answered the phone was incredibly rude and hung up on us. Thinking the restaurant was probably slammed and she was stressed, we let it slide. 

We called later in the evening, around 7:45 when our flight had landed to place an order for pick up while we were getting our car to head back home (home again is less than a half-mile from Chompie's Deli) and the woman who answered rudely informed us that she would not take the order over the phone. We would need to place the order in the restaurant but she did matter-of-factly inform us that there was a 30 minute delay with take out orders and that the restaurant closed at 9 pm sharp. And then, of course, she hung up on us when we were asking other questions.

I get it, they are a Jewish Deli and one of only a handful of restaurants open on Christmas Day, but the quality of your service and food is best judged when you are at your busiest. 

FYI We ordered Chinese take-out last night...and I cannot stand Chinese food."}
{"text":"Do you prefer a mile high pastrami on rye? If so, then run, don't walk to this Chompies. On the edge of the ASU campus, it's  within a fifteen minute drive from my condo. It's best to go during \"off hours\", unless you don't mind waiting. Try the Matza Ball soup, it's loaded with veggies, plus a hearty broth. A breakfast special for under $5 is available everyday. The servers are friendly, cute & efficient. What else does a person want in a restaurant?"}
{"text":"\"meh\" indeed.

Let me start by saying im not a food snob.  Hell i lived of ramen and mac and cheese thru most of my 20's so i'll pretty much eat anything. I will not, however, be eating here again.

There was a wait when i got there and i usually take that as an indication that the food is really good.  Turns out Chompies is more a place to see and be seen for the college kiddos instead of an actual awesome diner.

I got french toast, boyfriend got pancakes.  My toast was burnt and the pancakes tasted like eggo microwaved pancakes. Im also not a food returner, if its edible, ill eat it, but this was pretty bad. I asked the waitress what was up and she very snootily retorted \"thats how it comes\".  Um . . . looking at the dude at the table next to me's golden, perfectly cooked french toast i asked her \"are you sure?\" She rolled her eyes and walked off, and apparently not to bring me something that didnt look like toxic waste as she didnt come back until 15 min. later with the bill. Oh and PS the home fries are just hashbrown mush with no flavor.  Dont bother.

The food was pretty nasty, the server was kind of mean, and it was so not worth the wait.

Ill stick to Matts downtown until i find another diner.

Bummer since i live in tempe and was really hoping to finally find a greasy spoon closer."}
{"text":"One star for the decent but waaaaaay overpriced turkey which to go.  No stars for the rudeness of the quote service unquote.  AN obvious trend here, talk back to overpaying customers about the price of a side soup and by no means thank anyone for their business.  Was so angry, had to walk out.  young female server at the counter....learn some manners.  I will never return to this joke of a deli."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Phoenix on vacation and after reading some of the reviews, were excited to try the bagels here. These are not NY bagels. They were awful. I couldn't even finish mine, and I love bagels. I got a garlic bagel toasted with regular cream cheese  - the bagel tasted like it had been previously frozen, it was too chewy and the cream cheese was tangy."}
{"text":"I love the soups and sandwiches there. The service is not always consistent as some of the waiter are always cranky but the food is always good."}
{"text":"I have been to Chompie's many times, and have never been thrilled. However, after our last visit, I will NEVER return. 

I have never been treated so poorly in a restaurant as I was at this location last Sunday morning. We were quoted a 20 minute wait. Even with a 1 year old child, we thought we would give it a shot. After waiting for 45 minutes, I went up to see what the delay was, as they had seated many people who came in after us, before us. They were working for of 3 seperate, handwritten lists and had NO comprehensive system. (And this was one of the MANAGERS) When I asked when we would be seated, she practically yelled at me, and told me she had no idea. Seriously? Needless to say, we left. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"very good deli - not quite like the best NY delis but for being in Tempe it's OK."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!  The breakfasts are all cooked to perfection, the bagels, pastrami, coleslaw and breads are all the absolute best quality and taste. 

Potato pancakes are a must try - I remember them fondly from my childhood. Hard to find a good latke in south Surrey !

Their unique eggs Benedictus are all fantastic. I recommend the one on a potato pancake of course. 

I am a regular whenever in town as you can probably tell. I have to admit I do factor Chompies in when making a travel destination decision. 

Something here for everyone. My picky 4 year old and wife both love it here as well

Enjoy !!"}
{"text":"We moved here from Northern NJ where a NY style deli is worshiped right along with any big religion yet in our last few years there, all the great NY style delis by us were closing in rapid succession.  Going into NYC just wasn't an option each time I wanted some half sours and a knish.   It took moving to Scottsdale, AZ to find a solution - go figure.

The gigantic menu you'd expect, pretty good bagels, great breads, not to mention the grilled cheese/Jewish sliders/patty melt/kosher dog with kraut/knish/fresh chips/potato salad/macaroni salad - all are awesome.  I did not care for the Reuben I tried, however, I am crazy picky about corned beef and I realize that a true NY deli serves the meat a little fatty so that's my hangup.  Husband had an omelet today that could have fed 4 people - he loved it. 

If you are going to Chompies with someone and it is their first time, force them to look at the menu online first or you will be filling up on half sours for some time as they decide.

Great service, efficient but not pushy."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been Chompies fans going back to when they were on 32nd street, so we decided to go to their Arrowhead location. What a mistake.
Ordered coffee, which is good, however no spoons. Asked for spoons (or at least stir sticks). Coffee got cold waiting, had to go to the counter to ask again, they brought soup spoons, huh?
Ordered Chicken-fried steak w latke and bialy. when the food came, latke was cold, edges were just fried breading tasting like grease. No applesauce to flavor it, bland and very tasteless. CF steak very heavy breading, could hardly tell there was meat inside. when the order was taken, asked the waitress if they had real butter, she said yes. Brought cream cheese with the meal. Went back to bring the 'real' butter and brought an oil blend. Scrambled eggs were also tasteless. Looks to be cutting corners. Not impressed. No need to go back there."}
{"text":"It had been a little while since we've been to Chompie's for the simple fact we hadn't been in the area around meal time. We decided to make a specific trip out there for dinner this past weekend and to be honest I was a little underwhelmed. The food was just OK compared to being excellent like it always was before. I'm not sure if there was a change in how they do things but we weren't served a plate of pickles like we used to upon being seated. I looked around the restaurant and didn't see any other tables with them either so maybe they stopped doing it, which is a bummer. Probably the most disappointing thing about the visit was the fact that I had ordered a Black & White cookie to go from the bakery counter and instead of putting the cookie in a plastic container they guy out it in a bag. Normally a cookie in a bag wouldn't be a big deal but by the time I went to eat the cookie later that evening about half of the chocolate on top was stuck to the inside of the bag and I was left with having to scrape it off which kind of ruined what was otherwise a delicious cookie. Oh well...guess we just won't make any special trips out that was just for Chompie's."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast with my entire office.  Food was great, service was also great.  Deli had a wide variety.  I had the French toast, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is a must when you visit the valley--Phoenix,Scottsdale. Breakfast is the Best, sharing a Chompie signature sandwich for lunch, top ift off w their great dessert and you have a great day going."}
{"text":"Hit this place up June 13, 2015. 9 AM

Well to start the food is always good here so that is why we come. They treat the kids well. Free samples. Free kids cookie. But then something happens making me question why we come here...

Someone needs to use the restroom. If you ever have the need preparers be disgusted. These are some of the nasties restrooms in the in industry. The floors are covered in grease, they smell, they look like they are never professionally cleaned. Check out the partially alive cock roach laying on the floor. Then you have to touch the soap dispenser and the handles and the towel dispenser. 

Sure few people wash their hands thoroughly for 2-3 minutes with soap in hot water but most people don't use enough soap and clearly don't rinse for 2 minutes and the rest of the people, kids included, leave the piss and crap on their hands...and all that leave this room with the cooks, wait staff, hostesses, dishwashers, etc. fecal matter EVERYWHERE because everyone has to touch all that stuff. 

Back to the ROACH...well if there is 1 there is at least 1000. If their germs aren't enough then think of all that poison that is needs to partially kill this one. It has to be all over this establishment. Picture to prove it...check it out. 

Someone needs to call the health inspector and they should bring the roach patrol. This place is nasty."}
{"text":"On the weekends the wait can take up to 15 mins. The service is always fast and friendly. The portions of food are huge so it's perfect for people that like to eat. The prices are decent since they serve big portions. Parking is never a problem."}
{"text":"Love the food but the service sucks. First visit they forgot to make my sandwhich. Second visit the didn't give me all my food. Third visit they gave my food to another customer. After 15 minutes for a sandwich that took 2 minutes to make, I reminded them about my order. The general manager Carol said \"they made it, they just gave it to another customer\" like I should be OK with paying and not having food. Unacceptable service. As much as I love the food I will not be back."}
{"text":"Really busy but worth the wait. Being from northeast I miss the certain goods I grew up with.  This was great for me. :-)"}
{"text":"It has to be eons since we've been to Chompie's for Sunday brunch, or any other meal for that matter. When we first moved to Scottsdale seven and half years ago, Chompie's was our go-to place . . . it didn't matter if we wanted breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Personally, I could eat breakfast for all my meals anyway so Chompie's fits the bill perfectly for me. But we tired of it after probably four years and thousands upon thousands of calories . . . so we gave it a rest, a two and a half year rest. And the funny thing is . . . now having gone back for brunch, I think I could put Chompie's back on our regular go-to rotation.

Some things have changed since we were last there, but all for the good . . . new upholstery, new look to the menu, new carpet . . . but the same faces are still there . . . and the good old standby items are still on the menu . . . Service on this particular Sunday at 11 am was brisk, polite, friendly. The coffee refills came on time without even asking. If I had any complaints, it was that the napkins are a little thin for such huge and sometimes messy meals and they neglected to set out place with knives.  

My French omelet was divine, cooked perfectly.  I asked for the onions to be almost overcooked and they were, and my eggs were soft. If there is the slightest bit of brown on my omelet, it's a minus sign in my book. I usually can't finish a 3-egg omelet, but this was so delicious, I almost finished it -- okay, I left one bite. The home fries were also yummy, some a little charred, just the way I like it.  My hubby had the Long Island Expressway Skillet which came with plenty of Nova Lox, cheese, mushrooms, onions, scallions and potatoes. Loved it!

As were were approaching the restaurant an older couple in a car rolled down the window, said they were from out of town visiting and asked where Goldman's was located . . . I said, you are in Chompie's parking lot, stay here, you'll love it . . . it's an experience!

Somehow I made it past the bakery without buying a thing! Everything looks so pretty. They even have high-heel shoe pastry.  That was new to me! I'm sure we'll be back soon and I won't be able to control my urges.

Thanks, Chompie's, for reminding me of what I was missing . . ."}
{"text":"Definitely the only place that I feel safe ordering a bagel with lox, cream cheese, and chopped liver!

Great food, good service, and I absolutely love the new location in Paradise Valley! Also, the portion sizes are huge, so you can have breakfast, lunch, and dinner in one meal. The kids portions are huge as well.

Build one in the East Valley please!!"}
{"text":"Huge menu, should have something you like, not all dishes are superb but everything is at least decent."}
{"text":"looks like an an authentic NY deli.  Food was pretty good.  we had a late breakfast but service was a bit slow.  coffee was decent.  The dining room needs a good cleaning. the wait staff was friendly. it was packed so we waited because it was a recommendation by the locals."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I've lived back east in NY and this place looked legit as soon as I walked in cuz of their bakery counter. They had every kind of pastry someone from the east coast could imagine. 

I ordered the Jewish sliders, their signature dish and it was delicious. The brisket was moist and the challah bread was so soft. Now I see why they chose this place on an episode of Man Vs Food.

The service was fast and friendly and the atmosphere was exactly like a NY deli in the middle of Manhattan. If you're in Phoenix and looking for a nosh you won't be disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Chompie's is special, Lovey is the key- she was there today, quietly greeting everyone and making us feel welcome! We've enjoyed her hospitality since the early days in a tiny location. Her family -and everyone who works there - reflects her warmth and friendliness. Today we had a very nice breakfast provided by Edward, a kind and cool young man. Happy Hanukkah and Merry Christmas to all of you at Chompie's- see you soon!"}
{"text":"Best New York-style deli in Phoenix.  Great dishes, great service! Breakfast menu consists of more than 12 different omelets.  Best is the French Omelet (which should be called \"Tivoli\" because it contains bacon and Havarti cheese), and the Idaho Classic which is for potato lovers!  Amazing, mile-high sandwiches and traditional Matzo-ball Soup.  Many, many choices for whose who can't decide.  Best bagels in Phoenix, too!  Have been coming here for more than 25 years and it gets better year after year. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I tried the Chef salad the first time there , the second Time I tried the Jewish breakfast sliders.. Both was EXCELLENT ! I recommend this place to eat & I'm not a local.. I live in Las Vegas & chompies is a place I return every time I'm in Tempe..."}
{"text":"Corned beef very bland .Price to high not like Chicago."}
{"text":"Disgusting is the word that comes to mind when I think about the overly priced breakfast I had at Chompie's arrowhead. I was excited to try their knish, as I haven't had a good one since I moved to AZ. The \"knish\", if you want to classify it as that, was doughy and under seasoned. I bought two, ate one bite and threw the rest away. As far as my bagel sandwich and my husbands breakfast burrito, was mediocre at best. Certainly not worth the hype or money. Will never return."}
{"text":"So I sit at the bar.  A TV is directly in front of me.  While the D-Backs are playing, I am having to watch the Golf Channel.  There is no tournament on.  Just a panel discussing ladies golf.  I ask the bartender/server if the TV can be switched to the D-Backs game.  I am told that the TV is controlled by the manager's office.  After asking a couple more times Gary, the manager, refused to change the channel."}
{"text":"Great salmon bagel, Grandson has child's burger on a bagel, loves it. Always good food"}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about Chompie's and had seen it on man V food with Adam Richman.  I have to say that I was unimpressed with both the sandwich the restaurant and the service.  

The infamous and most popular Reuben sandwich left much to be desired. This restaurant apparently he feels the need to make up for average corned beef by giving you more average corned beef.  The proportion of beef two other ingredients was inadequate.  I had to ask for extra thousand Island dressing just to finish the meat portion of the sandwich, because it was dry and relatively little sauerkraut on top.  

The server suggested I try the turkey sliders, which I believe I might do next time, but I do not believe that I will be ordering the Ruben at Chompie's again.  

Suggestions:
Cleaner restaurant
Ceaner bathrooms
More quality meat
More toppings on the sandwich

All in all, this place just wasn't worth the hype."}
{"text":"Horrible service by Scott J. Very poor service. I had never been here before and was not prepared for the \"process\" it was for the staff to take and prepare a to-go order. I waited in a busy staff area next to the soda machine, where I was told to stand, under a big pink to go order sign for over 25 mins. I also heard the staff speaking poorly about me and that they had forgotten to put a portion of my order in..not a pleasant experience and management was the worst part. Scott J needs an attitude check. I'm the paying customer, it's his job. If he doesn't like his job  (clearly) he should get a new one."}
{"text":"Oh Chompie's... one of my favorite Tempe finds! Chompie's is home to my favorite soup! Chicken Matzoball Soup! Delicious and onxious with awesome flavors. I have had a great time sittig outside yapping with my sister about who knows what while munching on the biggest pastrami and saurkraut sandwich EVER! This thing was HUGE! I was scared, I was elated, I was determined. 

I went again for dinner and had my same matzoball soup but this time I had the Chicken Schnitzel. Warm. crunchy and full of flavor I was elated. The sides were eh, I make better carrots and the potatos were okay but the gravy had an odd flavor I wasn't too fond of. I have YET to try a dessert, but someday I am going to damnit!! 

Oh and the pickles are yummy! :D Jussayin' The service leave MUCH to be desired for. We had to ask for everything about twice and the staff likes to play handsie in a closed section behind frosted glass. I had craptastic service both times I went. But I still hope ya'll give chomp down on some Chompie's and fall in love with it like I did!!"}
{"text":"Not a native of Arizona, nor had I heard of this restaurant until last week when I was researching a new place to experience. Thrilled and will come back here every chance I get! The service was good and the food was stellar. The quality of the meat was simply outstanding. Thank you, thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Service has improved, still a bit slow, but much better. Their snack area is always stocked, restaurant area is efficient. I don't give up on businesses due to experiences but if it's a detrimental bad experience then my money will go else where. Thank you Chompies for your service, I will continue to visit."}
{"text":"This new spot is soooo NYC.  It reminds me of back home only better.  The bagels are the perfectly baked & deliciously chewy !  Yum.  Tasty mazo ball soup( chicken soup) with boiled veggies & shreds of chicken.  I feel so good when I eat it.  Healthy, like I'm doing something good for me! Service was good, plenty of food. Go hungry or take some home for later!"}
{"text":"The most authentic jewish deli experience? I think not. But chompies serves up some pretty delicious Jewish inspired comfort food. The pastrami bagel melt and Jewish sliders (brisket, latkes, gravy, etc...on challah bread) are not to be missed!"}
{"text":"So glad that I discovered this Chompie's location. The three I've been to have been great but this was the best location yet. My family of four was treated like we were apart of the owner's family. The service is so kind and attentive from the moment you walk in. We live in a mobile phone age where people are ignored. No one likes to converse any more. Thank God for the people at this Chompie's that engage you and make sure you're needs are met. I found this so refreshing. Hostess Beatrix was so nice and professional. I will drive the extra 15 minutes just to be treated so nicely by her and the rest of the staff. Our server was Hillary and she was spot on. She got our drink and food orders quickly and came back to check on us after food arrived. So nice to get an ice tea refill without having to ask.  At one point a manager or owner came by our booth and told us how happy she was to have us and hoped we had a nice meal.  Again, it made us felt like family. 

I got the Grandpa's Ruben with corned beef (I hear c.beef is better for you). It was awesome. Piled high but not grossly high. Great fries and slaw too. I recommend trying the onion strings. We didn't have room for dessert but enjoyed looking at the pastries in the bakery section. 

The food was great but it's service you will remember. I will be back and hope this staff stays in place. Good job Chompie's."}
{"text":"Today was my second visit to Chompie's at Chandler Mall. The first was with my two boys and husband. It was a nice experience I had the corned beef sandwich that I found fairly bland but my husband's hot pastrami was great. My husband paid so I didn't pay attention to the cost. Grabbed a black & white cookie on the way out and was disappointed. 

Today I got the pastrami and it was great! Too bad the service was terrible! The hostess was nice but the waitress just could not care less. It was just me and my young boys and it happened to be kids eat free with an $8 entree. The pastrami was 7.99 I wondered what she would do.

First they only brought over two glasses of water,               then another...........................then......took....my.........order. It took a reasonable amount of time time to get the food. But I was annoyed I had to ask her for pickles since they typically bring them before the meal. Then there was never the stop by asking \"how is everything?\" Everything was fine but she should ask. Then we ran out of water and I had to flag her down, I think I annoyed her this time. I would feel bad except for the two guys who were seated so long they finally asked the hostess to find the waitstaff.
I was thinking about the tip - I tip well even for ok service but this was not that. I decided I would base it on whether or not she took off one of the kid's meals for the $7.99 meal. She did, the bill was $14.49 so I based her tip on the full price of $20.00 for two kid's meals and a half pastrami sandwich, I gave her a twenty and she brought me back five singles for my change! What the hell happened to the 51cents???? I left her $3 I felt cheap but she deserved it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place is really hit or miss. Some days I woud give it 1 star, other days its 4 stars. So after many visits, and after having to wait 10 minutes to even see a hostess today, I've decided they are a reliable 3 stars, when measured over time."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch...1/2 order of mile high roast beef on a salted bagel -- was actually a full bagel with a good amount of beef. Coleslaw very tasty as were the fries.  Loved, loved, loved the salted bagel."}
{"text":"Love this location. Zach (tall guy with glasses) is the best server, we always sit in his section. Wonderful food, so many options, good bang for your buck, excellent service!"}
{"text":"Large menu with huge portions.  Crowded, enjoyable atmosphere.  Great bakery. Somewhat pricey but worth a trip.  Food was good.  Had breakfast the Spanish Omelet & a breakfast sandwich made of eggs, bacon, cheddar on 2 potato pancakes; bagel with cream cheese.  All were fresh & plentiful.  Sandwiches are huge as well.  Offer \"healthier\" choices as well."}
{"text":"Our book group had not visited Chompies for awhile.  What a pleasant surprise it was when we were actually greeted by the General Manager, Adam, who welcomed us and who was friendly and cordial.  We were taken to our table by the hostess and from that point on everything was outstanding. The food was excellent and served promptly. The restaurant appeared very clean and attended to which is important to us.  We had ample leftovers which were bagged for us when we left.  The entire staff smiled and thanked us for coming.  Wow, it doesn't get better than that.  I can see why people would return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"worst place for breakfast. Who runs out of biscuits and gravy? That's poor management. Oink down the street is better. Not to mention much cleaner than this place in a dirty mall."}
{"text":"Sanitation please!! Several people touching and making the food and same people taking money at the register. Was there 20 min and never witnessed a person wash hands I between. Got food and was hungry enough to try and eat any ways. Eggs were cold only thing good was bagel. Spit it all out and threw away. What a waste of money. People were nice but I don't want food poisoning. Already feeling upset from what little I did swallow"}
{"text":"Lunch was great yesterday!  The Matzo Ball Soup was outstanding like it normally is.  I had Matzo Ball Soup at many other places, but no one makes it as good as Chompies!"}
{"text":"Love the Ruebens. They have four different kinds listed on the menu. They are grilled to perfection and quite large. I am also a huge fan of the chicken noodle soup with matzo ball. Just plain good.

Service has always been good."}
{"text":"Five stars for food and three stars for prices. I love the Ruebens (yes, they have multiple kinds of them)! I am not so much in love with the price tag. Rueben with drink, tax, and tip comes in around $15. 

That said, I have eaten at Chompie's around 30 times. I really do like the service and the food. Would recommend for others."}
{"text":"We sat outside to enjoy the sun. Delicious iced tea & screw driver. The patio need music. However, our server Albie, gave us amazing service! The Baja omelet was spot on, and loved the potatoes salad. Perfect lunch - thanks Albie!"}
{"text":"Food is good. But, the place (no matter which one you go to) needs to be cleaned up. It's a shame because if they did that it would rate 4 stars."}
{"text":"I ate at Chompie's twice over the last week while on vacation in the area.  The food is incredible, the service was not.  The server on the first visit was pleasant, friendly but we never saw her after she delivered our meal and had to request the check twice.  Second visit; server not so friendly, delivered the food and again - we never saw her until we got up to ask for the check.  Is it that hard to be attentive and provide good service?"}
{"text":"Great customer service but for the price I'm extremely disappointed in this establishment .. I ordered a Aaron's choice which was suppose to be hot corned beef and pastrami with melted Swiss coleslaw and 1000 island served on Jewish rye... when I got home and opened up my sandwich which was $16.99 it was on a onion roll no 1000 island and the cheese was cold ... by far one of the worst sandwiches I have ever had... I should of just made PB & J and saved my money .. my friend ordered a Cajun chicken Ecstasy chicken was over cooked and rubbery with absolutely no flavor what so ever we both had to add our own ingredients to make these sandwiches edible the side of Coleslaw was brown so that got thrown out and don't get me started on the nasty pickles super salty someone messed up the brine. I did enjoy my brownie and it was reasonably priced but this will be my first and last time at this establishment."}
{"text":"We were so excited that Chompie's had opened another restaurant in the Arrowhead Mall that was much closer to us BUT after eating there, we were extremely disappointed.  I had the corned beef hash and egg breakfast.  Though they give you large portions, the corned beef hash was HORRIBLE.  It was mushy (similar to canned dog food) and had a nasty after taste.  My scrambled eggs had no flavor at all and the home fries weren't really cooked.  My husband had the brisket sandwich, which was extremely dry and tasteless.  So sad since we've been eating at Chompie's since they were at 32nd Street & Greenway, and following them all over the valley.  Unfortunate that they're going down in quality."}
{"text":"Today I'm having half a pastrami sandwich and a cup of matzoh ball soup good stuff and like always good service"}
{"text":"We went back again.  We came in at 8:30.  They close at 9 so we checked in our way in if it would be a problem.  Even so, our waiter, who was awesome, was fast and we had food in just a few minutes.  We were finishing right at 9 and could hear people in the kitchen cleaning up.

At 9:03 an older Hispanic lady bussing tables came to take our plates.  That was fine, but she was incredibly rude, talked rudely to us, tried to take my drink (and when I said I wasn't done with it she tried to grab it from me).  She slapped her hand on the table in some sort of angry protest at us too.  We weren't even the last people and we're still just waiting for our check.

I was a little shocked at our treatment. The waiter walked up just a minute behind her and was just as good as ever. As we left I spoke to a woman I thought was the manager and told her that if coming in at 8:30 was a problem they shouldn't  have let us know at the time and that it was fine.  There are other places in the area open late we could've gone to.   I hadn't been treated that rudely in a long time. She seemed somewhat shocked too but in retrospect I think she may not have been the manager either."}
{"text":"While the food is ok, who wants to pay $15 for a roast beef sandwich. Jasons Deli is a much better deal."}
{"text":"Terribly Disappointed! Was told Chompie's was the place to go for authentic Deli.  While the menu had all of the right items, I was so disappointed.  The matzo ball soup (broth specifically) was about the only item that was decent, though the matzo balls themselves were lacking.  I had a Mitch's Brooklyn which was a brisket, corned beef & pastrami combo.  It was missing the swiss cheese, which I specifically requested. The brisket was dry and flavorless (which I suppose I should be thankful for because it could have just been gross altogether), the corned beef was bland and while the pastrami was decent, it wasn't enough to save the sandwich. My sisters broccoli that came w/ her meal was overcooked and the challah bread on my nephews sandwich was a bit stale.  The choc. mouse cake seemed dry but not as dry as our waiter, whom was void of any personality and wasn't very good at his job.  He came to \"check\" on us so long after the food runners brought the food that it was really too late to fix anything.  At best the waiter was an order taker and I think even that is being generous.  I am very glad I don't have to rely on Chompie's for my deli-fix and if it's \"superior to anything in the Bay Area\" as stated in Mitch H.'s review, I feel sorry for Mitch H. because he has no idea what good NY style deli really is.   Bleech!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great yummy food! Fun atmosphere and a huuuge menu! Wish their hours were a bit longer, but still reasonable. Great place!"}
{"text":"I am late in writing this review. Our meal was a few weeks ago but wanted to share with you what happened.  There were 8 of us for brunch.  I had made reservations and when we got there the table was all set for us. Water, little pastries, etc  and was immediately asked what we would like to drink.  The food was great and the service was awesome. Wish I could remember the lady that served us.  I will definitely be back. So glad chompies is at the mall!  Thanks again. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If heaps of food at a reasonable price is what your after look no further then chompies. The menu is as gigantic as the sandwiches. While chompies is best described as a NY Jewish deli don't let the thought of liver scare you off !"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for a couple years now, it was the first place I ever ate at when I moved to AZ and I feel like it's almost hit or miss. There is times where I love it and times I wish I hadn't gone. But at the end of the day it is still one of my favorite places in Tempe. Love the 5 town. Love the bagels. Drink menu isn't bad. Screwdrivers there are generous with their pours. Sometimes. I still will continue to go to this place because the food is good. And nothing is better than a good delicatessen."}
{"text":"Good and extensive menu. Always consistent. Fantastic matzah ball soup. Does serve alcohol and there is usually not a wait."}
{"text":"No good today. The service was really slow, the food was just ok and there was a HUGE roach on the floor under our table. The manager was accomodating and gave us 50 percent off our meal."}
{"text":"We just tried to eat here- it's the first time I've walked out of a restaurant because of the hostess. She was rude. We walked in and I asked if they were seating the patio because it's only 81 degrees outside..in AZ. Everyone in AZ knows you seat a patio when it's in the 80s in Phoenix. They had a 20-25 minute inside wait and aren't seating their patio.... This makes no sense. She said it was too hot. TOO HOT? Three weeks ago when it was 105 was too hot. Today is beautiful out.  She was rude about it, didn't say I apologize for the inconvenience or anything along those lines... Just it's too hot and I'm not doing anything about it.  I will never go back. Just because it's a NY-themed place doesn't mean the employees need a NY attitude.


I would like to edit my review (it's about 4 days later on 10/3) to note that Chompie's immediately reached out to me upon the posting of my review to apologize and offer me a gift card to come back & have a better experience.  This is extremely appreciated.

If we do go back, I will re-review them and assign stars according to that visit and take into account the fact that they reached out to apologize as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the closest I'm going to get to NY style food. Just about everything is great here. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ever since my family moved to AZ from NY we had been searching for a place that had decent bagels. We thought it was a lost cause until we discovered Chompies. As soon as I walk in I feel like I'm back at home and it always brings a smile to my face. There's pastries and cookies in there too that I never thought I'd see again unless I was back home. Best bagels in AZ that we've found!"}
{"text":"Bad waffles. Tasted like they were frozen then microwaved before serving."}
{"text":"My first visit and it was a real nice experience.  I got rare roast beef after seeing it in the deli counter I couldn't resist the bloody deliciousness!  I also had a cup of the beef mushroom barley soup.  I could tell it was homemade because it lacked some seasoning.  A bit of salt and pepper helped. The atmosphere was busy, bright and upbeat.  Joseph was our server.  He seemed to lack confidence but was overall acceptable."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would.  So disappointing.  I had been here previously with my dad and service was okay but food was delish.  I wanted to bring my husband because he is from NY and this is his style.  We are currently driving out of the mall parking lot because we sat at a table for 10 minutes and no one even acknowledged us.  There were 2 other tables and 4 servers working.  Hostess and all servers made eye contact with us and just kept chatting away.  Because of this we just left....customer service fail.  Even worse hat the manager checked on the other two tables and walked right by us.  Good food the first time but because of service we will not come back.  So disappointed!"}
{"text":"On Saturday the 25th went to chompies at about 3:15. It was obviously not a prime time. Plenty of available tables. Waited 4 minutes before someone noticed we were waiting to be seated. Finally seated right behind host station in plain sight of all servers going to and from kitchen. Waited more than 6 minutes for someone to take order while host chatted several feet away with employee going off duty. I felt we were imposing on their personal time. Our order was finally taken. We eventually were served. The monte cristo sandwich I ordered was over cooked to the point of cremation. I mentioned it to the waiter and suggested that he tell the cook to watch it next time
he made one so it would be edible. I was not offered a replacement or credit. I didn't push it since by that point I wanted out of there. I have been to this restaurant several times and have always enjoyed the food and service. It was obvious to me that there was no manager on the floor or an inadequate one. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!"}
{"text":"Theresa and Amanda did a bang-up job of taking care of our group on September 14.
Our T.H.E. group gathered for a traditional nosh after Rosh Hashanah. The tables were set for a very pleasant setting and the service and food was outstanding!!! Many kudos to these lovely  ladies and staff at the Chandler Chompie's!

{"text":"I guess this is an east coast/midwest thing because I really don't get it. I'm not a picky eater and I HATE wasting food and money, but I could not finish my plate. I ordered french toast and I was not aware that my french toast was going to be deep fried. Seriously, when I put my fork through it, a piece of fried toast hit me in the eye. My husband was also not impressed with his food. If someone would like to suggest something delicious on the menu that I should try, please let me know because I currently want to vomit every time I see a Chompie's."}
{"text":"Went back and forth 2 or 3 stars went with 2 this time.  Went to Chompie's last night for St. Patrick's Day corned beef meal for $18.99!  It was the worst meal I have ever had at Chompies.  The meat if I could call it that was thin very thin dried out slices of sandwich meat thrown on top of a rock hard slice of cabbage.  The carrots were good and the soda bread.  I should of brought the corned beef home for my dog but left it on my plate.  Sorry, you missed the mark this time, my husband who orders the chicken wrap almost every time we go to Chompies said it was the worst he ever had there.  Guess, since it was packed you don't get the same great food Chompie's has.  I will never eat there again on St. Patrick's  Day again it was pretty bad. Forgot to mention as others have said it was stone cold when the dinners did come out."}
{"text":"I have been to the Tempe location of Chompies many times but have been wanting to go the the Chandler location as it is much closer to where I live. Since we have family in town, we decided to take them here the other night so they could sample all of the awesome. 

We went for dinner around 6:30p on Saturday night and I was moderately surprised to see that they were quite slow for the time of night. We were promptly seated by a very bubbly hostess. Our waiter came by shortly later and was equally friendly. There were 3 adults and 2 children in our party and we split 2 meals between us. The meals are HUGE!!! We ended up with leftover after sharing the 2 meals 5 ways!!!

We ordered the Jewish sliders and the Monte Cristo Sandwich. Both were very good, but the Jewish sliders were REALLY something special. My husband is Jewish and was raised eating his grandmothers authentic Jewish cooking. He said that the sliders taste just like something his grandmother used to make.

Our server was very responsive and anticipated refills that were needed. The meal seemed to take longer to make then I anticipated considering how slow they were. Since we didn't have anything else going on we didn't mind the wait. 

Bottom line:

* Food is awesome and authentic to NY and the Jewish style cooking.
* Not a great place to go if you are in a rush


We will definitely be returning to Chompies for more of their Jewish sliders in the near future!"}
{"text":"I am a chompies regular and really struggled with writing a review. To start with a plus, the bagels are the best in town. Their everything bagel is seriously ridiculous! When it comes to everything else, it's just okay. For breakfast I've had runny eggs, undercooked potatoes and soggy bacon more than once. For lunch I've waited upwards of 30 mins for a check. But the portions are huge and prices are very reasonable. And kids eat free Mondays and Tuesdays. Not to mention you can split a kids meal between two or three kids. So why do I keep going back you might ask? I work really close to there and I am in love with their bagels. Two eggs, bacon, sausage or ham, home fries and a bagel is only $5.99. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"My sister and I recently visited Scottsdale and on recommendations on tripadvisor visited Chompies. WOW! We tried the mushroom beef barley soup which was delicious, hearty and a great comfort food. Other standouts were Shirli's \"La Jolla\" Salad, enormous and good, hot Pastrami sandwich whole which was great and enormous also, by the way enormous pretty well describes most of their food choices. Breakfast was also great, try the corned beef hash or Bagels. The service was also great and very attentive. I could go on and on describing great dishes, because we ended up eating here every day for lunch and breakfast for six days."}
{"text":"Love this place. Benedicts to die for and sandwiches  that never stop. There is also a bar at this location which is great to eat and converse if you are by yourself."}
{"text":"Tried this place for breakfast today. Much like lunch, I was underwhelmed by my experience. That being said the pastry case does look pretty impressive, so maybe I'll try them for a special event."}
{"text":"By 1 meal meal and share. Huge portions. 

Can be a little greasy depending what you order. Definite family place."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The Matzoh Ball soup is great as well as the corned beef sandwiches.  The bakery is fantastic.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Disappointed in our service today. The food was good, no issues with the food. As soon as people were seated, everyone was given a delicious looking blueberry coffee cake, but we never received any. We were about to ask for ours when our food showed up, so we decided what we had in front of us was enough.  My wife had a terrible time getting a refill on her tea. Her glass was completely empty before our breakfast arrived. There was a lady walking around making sure everyone had coffee refills and saying hi to all the tables (she said she was the manager). She said hi to all the tables around us except for ours. We kept hoping she would say hi so we could also ask for a refill, but she never looked at us nor did our server notice my wife's empty cup after walking around us for a good 20 minutes. After we were finished eating, the server came back to get our plates and finally asked my wife if she wanted a refill on her tea. At this point we were leaving, so she was just drinking my water.  I couldn't help but notice how friendly they were to most of the tables, but they never once said hello, thank you, or good bye to us. I know we are not regulars, but being friendly to everyone is a good way to make new regulars! We couldn't help but feel like maybe a small part of it was that we are a gay couple?"}
{"text":"Delicious pastrami sandwiches. Split one because they are huge. Had a nice large multiple ingredient salad that was rather tasteless but somehow very satisfying... Go figure.  The knish was weird, not one seen in my New York days.  I think the place is really cute and the service top notch.
Cons: pricey"}
{"text":"Bagels! Bagels! Bagels! This is the #1 spot for real bagels here in Arizona, in my opinion. Make no mistake, I am not talking about the bagels that are sold in the supermarket.  They are not the same.  They must be made somewhere differently, because they taste nothing like the ones from the actual restaurant. They also have fantastic cream cheese varieties. We get the veggie one often but have also tried the plain, and chive and are all really good and fresh. If you are going to eat there, expect a wait if it is a prime time, and super friendly service. I would recommend breakfast fare (it's all good!) or if it is lunch time, go for the typical Jewish deli stuff like matzo ball soup (so good!) or a reuben sandwich. Those items really stick out as special to me, and are not easy to find here in Arizona. It is a great place where you can get whatever you are craving and everything is good. They give the kids a cookie with their meal which my kids totally appreciate.  Not fast though, be patient! Also, you can order egg sandwiches from the bagel area and they are delicious.  Gives me a little taste of the east coast which I love."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  I have eaten there several times and never had a bad meal.  Hugh portions, great bagels and desserts."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Chompies! Everything on the menu is amazing!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here.  The food is always spectacular and the staff is very welcoming and polite."}
{"text":"Wow. I couldn't have engineered our recent experience here any better than what we received. 

We went in around 10am and were seated. Our food and drinks were fantastic and, while pricey, represented good value. The quality and quantity were not wanting in the least. 

Finally, the service. My God, the service. It. Was. Amazing. The waitress knew the menu inside-out and gave some very astute recommendations. The couple points she didn't know--I ask esoteric questions on occasion; I'm curious--she promptly found answers for. 

We had a fantastic time and hope to produce enough income to become regulars here. Great food, great service, great experience. Thanks!

EDIT: Argh, this was queued up as a \"draft\" for six weeks. Thanks again, Chompie's folks!"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning after eating at this location.
On my visit every surface I touched was dirty and/or sticky. Also quite expensive. Not going back."}
{"text":"Went to Chompie's thinking it was a Kosher deli.  NOPE!  I asked after ordering a pastrami sandwich that was generously lined with fat.   I couldn't eat it after seeing that.  I got up my nerve and showed the waiter my sandwich.  He didn't act surprised, and told me that's normally how the meat usually is.  WHAT?!  So I paid for fat.   Thats when I asked the question about kosher, to astonishingly learn, Chompie's is NOT a kosher deli/restaurant.  How deceiving!  I was not happy!  And then, to learn that they \"just use the word Style\".  WHY?!And you conveniently put it next to \"Kosher\".  Hmmm?!  As to pose as being kosher?!  Maybe I'm just too trusting.  Needless to say that this seemed very deceiving to me so, needless to say, I never went back."}
{"text":"Not the same as it once was.... 
First $ 20.00 for a sandwich and drink ... Yes I said 20 bucks,  if it was the same ok then worth the indulgence... but sadly it was not.. The roll was stale  and the hot thick cut fries have been replaced with potato wedges... not great and disappointing ...bring back the  cafeteria style line so we can see what your making right in front of us... R.I.P old school Chompie's"}
{"text":"Cockroaches! Beware if you eat here you might end up with a huge cockroach crawling on you!!! 

Here is the story of a horrific lunch experience. We decided to eat at Chompie's for a graduation luncheon to celebrate with family and friends... What started out being fine with our drinks served transformed into a nightmare. 

Food was served...by the owner (did not know that at the time) I ordered their signature meal- the jewish sliders, others ordered the coney hotdog, potato pancakes, salmon bagel. Food looked fine but looks can be very deceiving. 

Everyone had at least a bite taken when I looked up and saw the mortified face of the person seated across from me. That look only means one thing...something terrible is wrong and it's on you! I looked down to find the largest cockroach I have ever seen crawling on my left shoulder!  

As a side note, I am not afraid of bugs... However a cockroach is far more then just a simple bug, and the size of this cockroach would give the heebie-jeebies to the toughest men.

Naturally, I swatted at it... Making it land close to the person I was sitting next towe both in reaction jumped out of the booth we were in ... The man that delivered our food just moments ago was there in an instant & to our shock grabbed this beast of a rodent by his bare hands.  My only thought is that the next table he served got a little extra on their plate! 

Not even having one full bite of my lunch the only thing the manager did was say he would take care of the meal... WHAT MEAL? We didn't get to get before our unwanted guest arrived, in my view absolutely nothing was done to rectify this absolutely grotesque situation.

This was no ordinary lunch, this was a lunch to celebrate a great achievement and enjoy each other company.  Now forever will these graduates will remember their graduation lunch with a huge disgusting cockroach oppose a celebration of their success as to what the lunch was intended for. 

Not only did Chompie's completely embarrass me, it also completely mortified me. 

I want you to image a cockroach the size of your thumb crawling on you right after you bight into your food... How would you react and feel?   Then add a special celebration to the situation.  I am completely mortified."}
{"text":"Been here a ton. Their menu is huge and if you can't find something you like here, you have never had food. The sandwiches are the size of my head and I love the sliders. I've filled myself to capacity so many times at Chompies that just hearing the name makes me full. You should stop reading and go now."}
{"text":"Don't buy into the hype.  The wait is too long, the food marginal, the staff overworked, and the place poorly maintained.  I'll be back only when forced here by friends.  I'll take Breakfast Club, Wildflower or Paradise Bakery over this place any day of the week."}
{"text":"The theme of this place is neat because it's New York City and I am partial to anything with my homestate, but the food was nothing really great. My family and I came there for breakfast. I ordered a vegetable omelette and bagel. The omelette wasn't really tasty and the bagel was definitely not a \"real\" NYC type bagel. The service was a bit slow as well. I give it credit for trying, but to me, it disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Chompie's since I was a kid. My grandparents are from the Cleveland area and always bring my family here when they are in town because it is as authentic as a Jewish deli can be in Arizona, plus I live a couple blocks from the Tempe location. 

The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I don't believe the quality of food and service match the prices. On one experience, a few friends and I happened to stay past the 8 o'clock closing time because we were caught up in conversation and didn't realize it. We figured it and started to leave about 10 minutes later, and a waitress yelled at us as we were leaving, telling us to pay more attention. I thought that was uncalled for and would have rather been told politely that the restaurant was closing at 8. Maybe she was just having a bad night. 

The matzoh ball soup is lousy compared to my grandpa's, but it is the best I've had at a restaurant in AZ.  

Otherwise, it's a great place to go for brunch or lunch, has a full-fledged menu with tons of choices, and you get a lot of food."}
{"text":"Chicken schnitzel was amazing. Service was slow and server didn't know the menu. Didn't know what a knish was."}
{"text":"Went here for a late breakfast.  Menu is a little busy and hard to read.  I had a \"Cragel\". It's in between a bagel and a croissant with eggs, bacon, green peppers and Havarti cheese on it. It was a very large portion.  This was my third time here. I've had better menu items before. Atmosphere is comfortable and busy.  I will be back but probably only if it's on my way to something."}
{"text":"Oy,  Here is what.  I wanted a celery soda, liverwurst sandwich and black and white cookie.  All were obtained and enjoyed but extracting them from Chompie's at PV was a serious pain in the tushie.

First, I get to the mall door coming from DIllard's at 8:42 pm.  The door was locked!  I made sure to leave Dillard's early enough to make Chompie's insanely early 9pm closing time.  I very rarely eat before 10 so I was already put out.  WHY do does anyone close their kitchen before 11 in Phoenix is beyond me but that is a separate issue.

I check my phone for the time to make sure I have not lost time in a department store and voila!  A man comes and opens the door for me saying he had locked that side early.  Here is a thing with me as this has happened before at many establishments in this valley.  If your closing time is 10pm you had better not even TOUCH that door before 10 PM is registered on  a GPS calibrated device.  Not restaurant time, not imaginary friend time.  REAL time.  Open until whatever o'clock means that I am to be served until that time.  

Receiving no direction I wander to the counter.  There is beer on tap and OH how I would love one but I sense lingering over a beer might get my food spit in.  I go to the deli and make my order.  I had to ask for normal black and whites as only Chinese almond are displayed.  Yum pumpernicle bread! Yum celery soda! Yum liverwurst!

Unfortunately all was packed to go without consulting me.  I intended to eat there.  There is a large sign on the counter indicating select pastry is half off after 3!  I had to ask what was included as nothing indicated the days choices.  Oh well.  

Then the whammie.  Dr. Brown's Cel-ray soda is 2.39 for a CAN.  Are you kidding me?  Who charges 2.39 for a can of anything?  It's more than a ball-park can.  Ugh.  I read the can. Since when is a traditionally kosher soda made with hi fructose corn syrup?!?!
The end times are coming. 

 I think I am done with Chompie's.  I have worked in the industry most of my adult life and would not close a main entrance before closing time with the exceptions of safety and emergency.  Nor would I give anything less than full service to anyone who arrived before the appointed time with the exception of liquor licensing regulated situations.  It is true, in a bar situation you have to be strict and run people off but in a primarily dining establishment if you make it in under the wire you are good.  There have been many an evening where close was 10 pm but I have been at work until after 12 because of this and I expect nothing less in return.

 All the foodstuff I ordered was correct and delicious but the pricing and convenience factor are so awful I can not recommend this place. Bummer as I am all about local businesses being successful. 

I am between 3 and 2 stars for this.  The food was really good and so I started with the 3 but as I wrote the review I became increasingly angry with the pricing and closing time attitude.  I will say that the lady at the counter was very nice and with the exception of making my order to go was quite patient...  Chompie's, pull it together!  Don't charge higher than NY prices in Phoenix. 2.5 stars but I won't round up."}
{"text":"Wow! What an eye opener! We enjoyed the decor. It is based on NYC. The menu is outrageous and took a while to take it all in. Our waiter, Darryl was super friendly and helpful.?
The good was plentiful and very tasty. We would return in a minute if we could."}
{"text":"A group of us went, and from around the table, it seemed folks enjoyed their food but wasn't necessarily impressed.  Pricey too.  My chopped liver (I know, am I like seventy? I try anything once) reminded me of sweet cat food and the bagel chips were so hard I gave up for fear of my teeth.  Sweet potato fries, ok that rocked.

i was excited about the bakery section though.  The counter guy was great, patient with me while I basically bought a sampling of everything.  The choc babka was unmemorable and extremly crumb-y (what a mess cutting it), but add insult to injury, I go to Luci's Marketplace the next day and find the same babka there for 35% less than what I paid at Chompie's."}
{"text":"If you have spent any time in New York or LA and have gone to a neighborhood deli like Canter's or Katz's, then you will be schooled on what to expect at Chompie's.  This is the Phoenix equivalent of those places.  They do an excellent job of replicating the same food and atmosphere, without the high prices of Manhattan or LA.  I won't go into the details of the menu options, since if you belong in this sort of restaurant, you should have a pretty good idea of what to expect and what you will like.   Plus, having a bakery here means that the bread you get with your meal is outstanding, and you also have the option grabbing a loaf or some bagels on your way out."}
{"text":"Food is great and the manager is so kind. However we have always had shitty service-waiters are short with you and hardly show up after the food arrives."}
{"text":"Stopped by Chompie's on a Sunday afternoon after my Niners beat the Lions. Just when I thought the day couldn't get any better, Jewish Sliders come along and prove me wrong. I remembered the guy from Man v. Food taking on the slider challenge and thought 3 sliders shouldn't be a problem. Wrong. Somehow the second slider was abnormally gigantic and I was not able to get to the third. I know, excuses, excuses...but its the truth people! If you're like me and can't finish the sliders, they taste just as great reheated later on in the day or the next day. And the fries and gravy are pretty damn good too. A must try if you venture out here for sure."}
{"text":"I go to Chompie's every so often for lunch, and I always leave with a full belly and the beginnings of food coma (it's kicking into full gear right about now...zzz.....).  Their sandwiches are piled high with meat, and their sliders are delectable.

If you are into food challenges, they do have a slider challenge that involves a dozen sliders, a pile of onion rings, and 1800 seconds.  Now, I'm not sure how any human being could possibly complete the slider challenge successfully, but kudos to you if you try it.  I was full halfway through my third slider.  Deceptive little buggers!

The lunch line is pretty significant, so plan on waiting for a table (for 5 of us today, it took about 20 minutes), or head in before/after the lunch rush.  The prices are a little higher than I would like, but for a once in a while lunch treat that's close to work, Chompie's is it."}
{"text":"What's the matter with Chompie's in Tempe?

That's always my question and I just don't have any answer. We've eaten at this Chompie's three times and we're always disappointed. However we've eaten at other Chompie's, most often the one in Chandler, and we're stuffed and happy. I don't get it.

We went with a group of Yelpers to this Chompie's because it's close to Gammage and we were all attending the opening night production of Fiddler on the Roof. So I suggested JewFood. Now, being an east coast Jew, I have certain standards which, frankly, aren't easily met in the desert. But they're not met at this Chompie's at all.

I phoned at 3:00 that afternoon to give them a heads up since we were expecting twelve people (we wound up with eight - you know how Yelpers are). I gave them the count, the time and made clear that we had a time crunch, needing to be out of there by 6:00 - 6:15 at the latest. When we got there the table wasn't ready.

We were seated fitteen minutes later and I told both the host and the server that we were attending the theatre and needed to eat and get going. Our food arrived at 5:45 or 5:50. I can't say for sure which it was. Had a hard time getting more pickles, I never got the lemons I asked for, sauces had to be requested repeatedly. And the food was nothing to write home to Bubbeh about. My extra lean corned beef was fatty and chewy and my daughter's patty melt, requested with extra onions came with a mere four pieces of onion. She asked for more but they didn't arrive until she was nearly done eating. I would have contested the extra charge for those onions but I had to get going or risk losing the opportunity to park in the Gammage lot. From the rumblings I heard around the table, we weren't the only disappointed diners in our party.

Now I've reviewed the Chompie's in Chandler http://www.yelp.com/biz/chompies-restaurant-and-bakery-chandler and gave it five stars. So the problems clearly aren't pervasive, in my opinion. If we'd had time we would have gone to the Chompie's in Chandler or the one in Scottsdale but the Tempe location was five minutes from Gammage. Oh, well. I'll consider this my farewell address. I won't be back to the Tempe Chompie's again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place is great. If you're thirsty stop by the bar Robbie Gilbert one of the best bartenders and always friendly. As for the food, the portions are huge bring a friend, servers are always friendly. I can't say enough about this place and the drinks behind the bar Robbie really goes the extra mile and adds his own little special touches here and there my wife and I love this place and we recommend it all our friends.  Try it out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The portions here are pretty good but the quality of food really varies from visit to visit. The bagels are probably the best around though."}
{"text":"Today was my friend's 21st Birthday, and I called ahead to tell Chompies we would be celebrating there. They wrote her name on a Birthday plate and lite candles and even brought over a free drink. I was blown away with the customer service and as always, the food. I really appreciate the service!"}
{"text":"I want to clarify that the Tatum and Cactus location is great, but this one really needs help. First, the service was horrendous. Young people who are clueless as far as serving goes.  Is this a training location for their employees???? Come on, folks. And...vacuuming the carpet while customers are eating is just gross. Going back to the bathroom, I noticed a stench and a big hole in the ceiling. What is going on with this location??? Thirty minutes after eating, I had to visit the bathroom with urgency. This is unacceptable for a Chompies. Get with the *&^(%(!  program folks."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Prices are fair. Went to the deli counter to take home some nice baked goods. 4 employees behind the counter, no other customers but me. They were all so engrossed in their own conversation they ignored me. 2 actually looked at me then went back to their conversation. This happened on 10/10/15 @ 8am. Went to frys where the customer service is better."}
{"text":"My regular breakfast spot, but sometimes you gotta have lunch or dinner! I have so many favorites here, eggs, bagels, latkes, matzo ball soup, sweet and sour soup, pastrami sandwich, Jewish or turkey sliders, turkey dinner, napoleans, ruglach, so much more!!
Beatriz keeps the tables full and her sweet friendly manner keeps people coming back because it feels like home. There are many great servers here, but I  have my favorites and today I am seeing one, Carie  is sweet and on the mark! Food comes out right every time with her and she is always smiling! Come in any time, you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I have now been here a few times and every single time the costomer service is horrible. They take about 15 minutes to get to your table after you've been sat. I would completely understand if it was super busy but half the restaurant is empty and theres always a group of employees standing around talking. I ordered one of those mile high sandwiches for lunch and I was thinking it better be the best damn sandwich ever for almost $20. After I received my order I was even more disappointed because it was the most disgusting pastrami sandwich I have ever had. There was no flavor and it wasnt even warm enough to melt the cheese. I will never come back to this over priced establishment."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 Benedicts and both were cold. Service was slow on the patio and hostess seemed kind of lost. Would give 2 stars for this visit, but they normally do so much better. Next time, I'll hit theTempe or Scottsdale location and leave another star or two."}
{"text":"DOG IN THE RESTAURANT?!?!? What sort of place lets a non service dog into their restaurant where it jumps all over the table? I hope a health inspector got to see what we did! Used to come here every Sunday. Definitely will not be doing that anymore. And all of this pains me to say since I'm an AEPi alumni but that was just nasty."}
{"text":"I LOVE Chompie's !!!

As a Chicago Jew that now lives in So Cal, when ever I'm in Phx I go here for breakfast. If my wife would let me, I'd drive over just to eat here.

That's how good the food is."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here was at their friends and family pre-opening event. Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I was neither friends nor family at that point (I was discussing a book event with Wendy), though in typical tribal fashion I was adopted by the Borensteins and made mischpucha (translate: family for the non-Yiddish speaking and goyem). Anyway, since that evening I've been there six or eight times. It's always terrific.

Though I always order a lean corned beef on rye, I've had a number of things with family and friends. Everything has been fantastic - the traditional comfort food I ate since emerging from the womb. Though I will caution about the matzo ball soup; it has a sweetness I don't care for. We've had blintzes, latkes, fish, knishes... The list is longer but that's all I can think of off the top of my head. Everything has been terrific.

Same with the service. I've been treated very well every time I've been there. For good or ill there is now a Chompie's closer to my house. The jury is still out on which it is, I mean, nobody ever said a \"latke a day keeps the doctor away.\" You know what I'm sayin'..."}
{"text":"This is my second time at chompies first was that PV Mall which I did not like this one was much better had the pastrami sandwich not too bad still not as good as Miracle Mile but pretty damn good pastrami was not smoked I think it was only cured the onion Roll seemed fresh it definitely is a lot of food so go hungry and you be very happy no definitely go back if I can't make it down to where I like to go it's worth the price only backs parents about it was the kid at the desert counter very rude I almost laughed but I didn't because I have to deal with him other than that great experience"}
{"text":"We came for here for the first time. Christmas breakfast had a \"small\" menu, we were informed that the main menu is MUCH bigger. 
I ordered an egg sandwich, scrambled eggs dry and sausage on an onion bagel. 
My husband had scrambled eggs dry and an cinnamon raise bagel. 
Well when our meal came out we both had two eggs and our bagels.... I didn't get a sandwich. When I pointed it out, our waitress Tracy offered to take it back right away and I just said it was fine. 
The eggs were runny, and my bagel was burned. 
I asked to talk to a manager at this point. It was our first time there and based on what had happened this far we weren't coming back. 
The manager took my whole meal off the bill but my main concern was that they didn't have the issue again with the clients that were about to come in. 
Tracy was awesome though!! Very friendly (even though she was stuck working Christmas morning, I'd be a brat if I was working probably) 
After the issue was addressed, based on the customer service, I'd give them another try. The home fries were delicious."}
{"text":"We chose Chompies because it was close to our accommodations and opened at 6a. We arrived about 6:10 and were promptly attended to however throughout I must say the waitresses demeanor implied we were a burden to her. She was not friendly, inviting, sour face, the whole shebang. 
 
 Minus her attitude we were SUPER happy with our selections. I ordered the corned beef Benedict which was served on a potato pancake, which was good but I would have preferred an English muffin. I could tell the corned beef was made in house, it was amazingly flavorful and the portioning was HUGE. Downside was the excessive amount of cheese used. 
 Hubby ordered the stuffed French toast and it was literally the BEST we have ever had. The filling included actual pieces of strawberry but what was the key was it seemed the toast was actually fried! extremely crunchy exterior, fluffy interior. Huge serving as well, we ended up taking half home. 

I also LOVED the deli section which offered some very decadent desserts sadly we had no room for any taste testing. A really amazing and unique breakfast offering place.

We also ordered lunch to go and they did an excellent job. Hubby has the corned beef breakfast with thinly sliced potato, heaping portion of their corned beef, and eggs. We also got the free bagel of which he chose the freshly made onion, also very good. I ordered the Asian chicken salad with no oranges and everything on the side. The sweet and spicy sauce was amazing as well as the peanut dressing and the chicken was thinly sliced and moist."}
{"text":"The cabbage roll dinner was especially amazing! Our server Arthur was so nice and attentive even though the restaurant was packed. We will be back."}
{"text":"You gotta try the buffalo Benedict!! A great take on the classic. Johnathan our waiter took great care of us even with some larger parties needing his service. Thanks Johnathan!!"}
{"text":"My last review focused on Chompies lousy service. Now I'm writing another review to expose how inauthentic their food is. I grew up in Jewish New York and have to tell people in Arizona that Chompies does NOT represent the luscious mouth-watering cuisine that has compelled famous Hollywood film directors to fly from LA to. New York just for a sandwich! Their rye bread is dry and over yeasty and sliced twice the appropriate thickness. Their chicken soup has more salt than a Christmas Ham. Their corned beef is not Jewish style First Cut but corned beef Round like you would find at the steam table of an Irish bar...leathery tough and baloney like in flavor. I could go on and on and on... If you're homesick for New York, do NOT go to Chompies because you will miss it even more after attempting this piss-poor imitation. They've got all the right visual decorations and menu items if you were shooting a movie about Jewish delis, but their food is MOCKERY that will disappoint anyone who's ever eaten at a real Jewish deli in NYC or NJ."}
{"text":"Everytime I order the breakfast from Chompie's, it's always very delicious when I have it."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent Chompie's quite a bit (at least once a month for breakfast).

I will be honest: the service is hit or miss. Really really great, or you wait 45 minutes for your food. But it's the food and the reasonable pricing that keeps us coming back. We're from Boston and like many Bostonians,  we prefer to support mom & pop places rather than restaurant chains when we can. The food is great! There are a lot of options (traditional, simple, Jewish style, etc).

My one biggest complaint/suggestion for the star's rating:
PLEASE, for the love of God, come up with something better than throwing hot coffee over a cup of ice for \"iced coffee.\" As an iced coffee lover, there is nothing more infuriating than that. It's Arizona, it's hot, and people will drink it if you serve it! That alone would bring me from 3 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Chompie's, based on my three visits, is very unfriendly to children, and I'm speaking of well-behaved 11 year olds, not crying babies."}
{"text":"I love going to Chompies but I am seriously disappointed. Your egg sandwiches are usually too big to eat but now you barely put  any egg on them! You all need to stop being so stingy with your food and start serving us the right amount of food for our money. I spent $6 on this and it's just sad..."}
{"text":"Tasted like the real deal to me...we shared salami sandwich and a hot pastrami...Really good..."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed this morning when the lady at this location would not let me order the breakfast special to go without adding an extra $1 to the bill.  I just ordered the same exact meal a week or two ago at the University Drive location and there was no problem in doing this.
I took a screenshot of that portion of the menu and it does not say anything about there being no carry out orders for this item
..."}
{"text":"Superb sandwiches.   Had a half corned beef and half pastrami sandwich.  The rye bread had a nice crust and was baked perfectly.  Very large portion.  Flavor of the deli meats was tasty.  Best deli sandwich in the city."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last weekend. We split the Aaron's sandwich which is a combo of pastrami and corned beef - swapped out the swiss cheese for American and the pickles were so good we had to ask for more!  The sandwich was delicious!  Perfectly constructed, warm and juicy!  The menu is extensive so it's difficult to make a choice but I'm sure everything is good. We'll be going back again very soon."}
{"text":"It's a fun place to go for breakfast or lunch, and the food is certainly delicious. We've had a few problems with the staff though. The hostess told my name for my husband and I, and we waited over 30 minutes for a table right in front of her stand. Finally, we asked her when we would be called after seeing she seated people coming in after us, and she said she called our name 20 minutes ago, which she certainly did not. That's not even the problem, as she wasn't even apologetic about it. Additionally, the crew at the deli can be a bit rude, especially with take out. You might have to wait a while to pay even if your order is hot and ready. They need a better system."}
{"text":"So I recently moved to Arizona and have never heard of Chompies before! I found myself there when I went to see what eats the towncenter had to offer that wasn't the food court and I found myself here after lunch hours.
The hostess was very kind and sweet, she made me feel very welcome and answered any questions I had about the menu.
My waitress, Kristen, was fantastic as well! Very perky and sweet! I would have liked a bit more attention, but a large table did arrive not too long after me so I understand her focus being pulled from just one person.

I got the Monte Cristo with Potato Salad,  my first Monte Cristo mind you, and it was very good!! The meal, with a soda, ran me $20 but I enjoyed it! It is a LOT of sandwhich considering what you pay. I was pleasantly surprised I liked the Potato Salad since I'm a southern girl and prefer mine southern style...but I was very pleased!

I honestly think I will be back again, hopefully with a bit more attention so I'm not left wanting for a refill on my drink, and to try an...Elvis Sammich I believe? I told it's what I need to try next!

But I do recommend this place if you are looking for very casual but good eats!"}
{"text":"Having the All-American breakfast as usual. I always get this because it is so good. Always busy here due to the consistency of the service and food quality. I from Chicago but when I come here I feel like I've been to New York."}
{"text":"{Actual Date of Visit: 12/21/2011}

Yay, a NY inspired spot!  I came here with some friends during finals week.  It was very lively!  I needed a cranberry mimosa stat!!  It was yummy!  Bobka Crumb French Toast.  I'm a sucker for French Toast!  It was good, but just a tad bit soggy with all the toppings.  All 3 of my friends ordered the chicken and waffles due to the rave reviews.  Unfortunately, one of my friends had to send hers back because it was lukewarm.  The other one felt the chicken and waffles wasn't authentic due to the use of chicken fingers and didn't like the cheese and corn added to hers.  *Shrug* Looked good to me.  The waitress was such a sweet girl!

So many choices! I'll have to come back!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend and got some of the best service in town. Lucy was our waitress and she was on the ball, cheery and attentive. We both had great sandwiches and they even have gluten free rolls. Can't eat the desserts but boy did they look fabulous. Masterpieces in the case. I' ll go again for sure. Ask for Lucy,"}
{"text":"Desperate to find a breakfast place on Easter morning we finally settled on Chompie's.  When we arrive we were seated quickly.  The waitress was kind and assisted us with the menu.

We ordered the Ultimate Benedict, Chompie's breakfast burrito, the $12.99 all you can eat ribs, and the Jewish Sliders.  Over all the good was good. 

Ultimate Benedict - good but heavy. corned beef hash was pretty salty, county potatoes very good.

Chompie's Breakfast Burrito - nothing special.

$12.99 AYCE Ribs - GOOD! Wish I ordered those for myself. Ribs were smoothered in a nice BBQ sauce that had a good sweet and tangy taste but not vinegary at all.

Jewish Sliders - I was told that it good.

Overall pretty good, I would come back on a sunday for the ayce ribs.

One thing I did not like was the bus boy that assisted in delivering our food spilt salsa all over me. Good thing I wasn't wearing anything expensive."}
{"text":"The food is a bit inconsistent, l think the service is pretty good we did not have a very long wait to be seated but it did take quiet a while to get our food."}
{"text":"Love the ruebens, the matza ball soup. Good bagels and lox and breakfast options for sure but imho the ruebens are where it's at at Chompies. Always pretty quick service too. Every meal I have ever had here has been solid though...and I've had many."}
{"text":"We ate at this location for the first time today and it was pretty good.  Marina was our server and she had a great welcoming smile and was fairly attentive.  She was very accommodating with our \"special requests\" on tweaking our orders.  I had the Greek benedict and I added turkey sausage and onions, my wife had the Athens skillet minus the artichokes and my daughter had a crossover between a burrito and quesadilla.  I, as I always do, ordered my potatoes burnt as crispy as possible and they werent, I should've taken a pic because they were almost raw, and my wife's skillet came with no feta so she had to ask for a side of it.  Even though my potatoes were done to my request my meal was very good and my wife said hers was very tasty even tho she barely touched it due to the fact she ate a bagel beforehand.  My daughter said hers was just ok.  We left there with a bill of 60$ and I had water my daughter a lemonade and my wife coffee and juice.  I guess it was a little pricy, bit what isn't anymore?"}
{"text":"It was ok. 14.99 (before tax) for a set french toast with 2 medium sized eggs and 2strips of bacon. French toast were   eggs were....eggs. The only thing got them 2 stars is the bacons(none fat bacon strips) 

Call me crazy but after having French toast here; IHOP French toast now automatically becomes speroyal food to me."}
{"text":"We were looking for a deli and came across Chompies. The menu was overwhelming! We asked our server for his recommendations and he gave us an excellent overview of what options we could choose from depending on what type of meal we were hungry for (breakfast, lunch, dinner, sandwiches vs plates, etc.) He also brought us a small plate with a few slices of different meats for us to sample. We opted for the Jewish sliders and the New Jersey sliders. Each plate came with three sandwiches and we each managed two and took the remaining sandwiches home. We didn't have any of the corned beef but tried a sample and it was amazing! We ultimately opted for the pastrami, which was also excellent! We were also thrilled with the service; Jay did such a good job I asked to speak to the manager to compliment him in his excellent service. 

Overall, it was an excellent experience. We are new to the area and appreciated the attentiveness of our server and the quality (and quantity!) of food. We will return!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Atmosphere is a little too \"truck stop diner\" for me, BUT the service is usually good."}
{"text":"Yummy, huge menu! I have yet to have something that I didn't like.  Plus they give you yummy pickles when you sit down."}
{"text":"Had to call in a catered breakfast for a film crew of 25 people with very little notice. Cathy worked with me to help craft the perfect combination of food for everyone and was extremely helpful. Would definitely recommend going here to anyone looking for amazing breakfast food and deli bagels."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick breakfast at the deli counter on a Monday morning. It was a very quick ordering process and our group was able to order our bagels swiftly. As this wasn't our first visit, we knew the food would be tasty. We are repeat customers!"}
{"text":"What a Jewish deli should be quality well done food that makes you happy.  Superb quality and food that reminds me of grandmothers.  The matzo ball soup is huge and tasty."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying we were in the mood for getting our grub on and we happened to see an episode of Man vs. Food featuring the slider challenge at Chompie's. How amazing does a slider sound with a potato pancake in it? To me and the fiance...that sounded incredibly amazing. So we ordered both versions of their sliders along with a side of crispy onion strings. Winners! The food is hearty and taste freakin' good. Mind you that the little sliders are hefty in flavor and very filling. I was only able to take one down leaving the other two for the next day leftovers....which...btw were just as exciting on day 2 as they were on day 1. But unfortunately, I won't be attempting the slider challenge anytime soon...those suckers are filling!

Take a peek at their menu and they have soooo many additional menu items. We are excited to go back and try more options including their breakfast items!"}
{"text":"Food:
-Ogre portions of everything
-Chicken noodle matzo ball soup, tasted like standard chicken noodle soup; I didn't know what to do with half of a matzo softball after I ran out of soup
-Reuben, tasty, stacked high with about 20 layers of red meat, looked like a giant piece of brick on the side
-Latkes, boring potato patties
-Sweet potato fries, they don't make in house, too soggy/bland on the side


Service:
-A little slow bringing out the food, pretty standard in general


Reason for the high rating- SUPERB issue resolution:
I found a piece of eyelash/hair or something in the sour-cream and had the waiter bring the whole plate of latkes back, didn't really think about it twice since it wasn't a big deal after the waiter said he'd take it off our bill. Two additional things happened next-
1. The hostess came over to hour table moments later, telling us that she heard about the incident, apologized, reassured us that their kitchen is in compliance with health inspection standards, etc., unexpected but nice gesture
2. The waiter apologized again for the kitchen mishap, and told us they took 50% off our entire bill, for that one piece of eyelash I found in my sour-cream side... ABOVE and BEYOND."}
{"text":"So far we've only tried Chompie's for their bagels.  We're from the east coast and I love a real New York bagel.  These are almost exactly what I want in a bagel.  I know, I'm in AZ now and can't get a 100% NY bagel, so these will have to suffice."}
{"text":"I have never had sliders and matzo ball soup as tasty as Chompie's. Their normal sized portions are huge, they dish out a lot of meat, and I love the NY theme inside. It isn't mind blowing enough for me to become a regular however I'm glad my cousins took me to this place"}
{"text":"A New York Deli in Scottsdale???

YES!!! OMG, what a place not to miss for breakfast, lunch or dinner. A HUGE menu with the real NY Deli choices. Everything we had was great and huge portions. 

Service great, friendly and inside decor depicts NYC scenes tastefully done."}
{"text":"The food's ok, but I think it's a little overpriced for what it is. I guess they can charge whatever they want though because it's always packed and I've been both before and after the Diners, Drive ins and Dives feature.

The jewish sliders are good."}
{"text":"Questionable layout. Not obvious distinction between takeout and eatin. Lots of old plaques on walls very outdated (2001), saying best cheap eats. My gf and I paid over$30 for 2 bfast bagels and coffee and oj. Not all staff are friendly. My gf asked for restroom directions. The cashier grimaced and acted like it was the most ridiculous request in world. I get more personality from the TSA at sky harbor. Tables are dirty.Ill avoid this place."}
{"text":"Chompies has raised prices once again and now they are charging $16.99 for a Reuben.  That is absolutely crazy - this isn't New York. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We stumbled in hungover on a Sunday morning and began the LONG wait for a table for 5.  They were busy!  After finally being sat we began looking over their huge menu.  They have a lot of options and they serve breakfast all day.  I just opted for a waffle with a side of bacon and it was good.  I would like to go back and try a sandwich since they have a full deli and their desserts looked interesting too."}
{"text":"Loved my chopped liver, my dad love his corned beef, mom had smoked whitefish which she loved.  I am used to Jewish deli chopped liver and this was the best I have had in years!  I would have rated this higher if we had not tried desserts which were good but not excellent although they looked great. 

Interesting they serve fountain Pepsi products BUT you can get a canned coke products which I thought was a nice option. 

The service was great.  It is a little pricey BUT NYC style deli's typically are higher priced.  

We had to drive 20 miles + to have a late lunch and I would go back again! There were so many items I would have liked to have tried!"}
{"text":"Honestly the food was absolutely delicious. The only thing is upgrade for the onion strings they are far better than the fries are. The only reason I did not give it five stars was because of the service. Lack luster at best. It seems to be a bunch of college kids that really don't care about good service. I waited through one refill to even get a straw."}
{"text":"We ordered the corned beef hash and it looked like a pile of fried chopped liver on a plate.   It looked so offensive I lost my appetite immediately and apologized to my friend who I was going to spilt this with.  The potatoe latke was  deep fried one too many times.  The bagel which I requested toasted was luke warm.  It was a bad meal.  We could only eat the scrambled eggs . This has to top the worst breakfast I've ever been served.  Some may like but this one will pass."}
{"text":"My kids and I visited last year and got the Man Vs Food  brisket platter. There were 4 of us and we still couldn't finish it..lol, although we wanted too because it was so good.  We are planning to go back this week. We made a pact that everytime we are in AZ we will visit for their great food. Im not a brisket person but this deli has changed my mind/"}
{"text":"Several years ago this place is a pretty good deal. Something has changed here as of late, serving size has gone down and prices have gone up. They do have good coleslaw."}
{"text":"Portions are massive, prices are high and the taste...well I've had better. Now I am speaking of breakfast, I haven't had lunch there yet. I don't even like the bagels they sell in the grocery store, the store brand tastes better."}
{"text":"Eggs were dry, potatoes were swimming in oil, the bacon had been sitting out for hours because that came out right away before there rest of the meal got there. The English muffin was cold when it was delivered. I had a stomachache all day after eating here. I will never eat here again. I cannot for the life of me figure out why it's packed all the time."}
{"text":"Read one read all reviews on this great find. Yes, it is a Jewish deli in the middle of Mesa Arizona. Yes, it has a menu comparable to a college thesis. Yes, they have a sweets to go counter. They have all of this and they have....drum roll please.......fresh salmon sliders!! Omg these aren't your run of the mill sliders. They are not pressed salmon patties. These are sliders made of fresh grilled salmon filet. So good!! The buns are so very good and soft! Oh, I meant the buns on the sliders ;) no but really, soft slightly sweet buns, cucumber, onion and tomato relish and crispity crisp potato wedges (I substituted for homemade chips) this meal was delicious, playful, teasing, original and filling. I'm sure that all of the reviews and pics are for the signature items but trust me order this!!!
Besides that, the ambiance was great. Friendly staff, happening crowd and the wait looks long but not as bad as you think. 
To top it of, I scored a day old bag of bagels and rolls for $2.50!!! Hell yeeeah!! 
Parking sucks but oh well. Plenty of seating, booths and tables. Food gets to you pretty quickly and the icing on the cake is they bring you house prepared pickles. Yuuuum!Meeeeee!!! 
All in all this place is a must stop. Stop in and enjoy the bountiful tastes and smells!!!
Can't wait to try something else but the salmon sliders were so good I probably won't. 
Hats off to the chef!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice so far, and each time I have enjoyed my visit. The parking is a little pain, but not so bad you drive around in circles for half a hour. The staff is very nice and very courteous but a little bit slow. I have noticed this both times I have been there. The food is a little expensive but with huge portions.

I must say though the menu is long and extensive and that worries me a bit. When I think long menu I thing frozen lots of frozen. But that could be just me. I do notice that they serve mimosas which is a big plus in my book.

Now the food portion of the review, the other guests that I have been with said there food was delicious, it looked to be really good. The first time I went one of my coworkers had the \"Old Fashioned Borenstein Burger\" and the other had a \"Monte Cristo\" and it was huge. Today I went with my family, my daughter had the \"Silver Dollar Pancakes\" which were not silver dollar pancakes, but crazy HUGE pancakes. It makes me wonder what a normal pancake looks like. My wife had a \"Classic Belgian Waffle\" with candied pecans mixed in. sadly the pecans came piled on top and were not candied. 

I must admit I have not tried anything but there \"Old Fashioned Borenstein Burger\". And it is huge and delicious I usually get mine with bacon and cheese, the fries are awesome they are not your usual wimpy fries, they are steak sized but have a flakiness to them if that makes any sense at all. Overall I'm in love with their burger, but you would need to do something seriously wrong to make me dislike a burger.

And one more thing, its dangerous to have a bakery right there displaying awesome sweets. I'm usually not into sweets but on a whim my coworker told me to pick something and the \"Like Heaven\" little cups caught my eye. Tried the Oreo one which is a chocolate cup with cream and bits of what look like crumbled Oreos on top, which might explain the name, and just to let you know good lord it was like heaven! If heaven is like that, I will gladly serve the lord so I can get some more of those tasty little treats. Today on my visit I bought three, one for my daughter and two for me. I know, I know.

Well in the end this place is decent the prices are a little high, but the food is good and you get your monies worth. Next time ill try something else maybe breakfast who knows."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time recently with a group of 9 which included three toddlers. Service was outstanding, especially given the challenges. Had the Reuben. So huge I took half home. Pastrami was tender and juicy. I lived in Manhattan for many years and felt like I was back there."}
{"text":"Lox and bagel with breakfast was pretty good, but not traditional. Schmears, no!  lox and scrambled eggs; okay. Lots of food, but I was hoping for deli-style lox and bagle. Still, pretty good breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME ! We've been here for breakfast and lunch. Their pastrami is some of the best I have ever had, but their breakfasts are incredible. Huge menu of some very different and tasty things. Ever heard of Latkes? Delish potato pancakes with, get this, sour cream. They also have crispy mashed potato filled pierogies. I think this place has the best jewish deli food I've had since I visited New York, and now it's at Arrowhead Mall. I plan to come here as often as my Wife will let me."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to eat a great hot pastrami sandwich because it was hot pastrami day. I came here for lunch on the suggestion of my coworkers. I was not disappointed. Looking at the menu I was overwhelmed because I wanted to eat everything! It all sounded so good from the breakfast to the smoked fish to the sandwiches. It's an Arizona New York deli concept. It's a restaurant that has a deli and bakery!! I ordered the half hot pastrami sandwich with provolone on a challah roll with potato salad. I added brown mustard to my sandwich and it was delicious! Sooo so good. Peppery juicy meat! I was offered and took the deli pickles. Not a fan at all. Not vinegar tasting at all. Maybe too kosher for me? 
Next time I come back it might be for breakfast, or getting another sandwich like one variety of their tunnels (pastrami, corned beef and other meats piled high on bread). I also got a black and white cookie and chocolate wafers which were delicious. The black and white was a sugar cookie with hints of lemon on really light and chocolatey frosting. I saw fruit tarts which I will get next time. I can't believe I thought this was a typical sandwich joint."}
{"text":"Great great great. I have never been but had a chance to pop in today and check it out. it's exactly what I expected and more. Super legit NY style deli. I went with the Jewish Sliders ($11.99). they came with three good size sliders with brisket, crispy potato pancake and cheese on Chollah bread. It also came with a side, I chose the macaroni salad and was super happy with it. it also came with thi sawesome gravy that i was head over heels for. All in all, a great spot to get a killer sandwich and authentic bagels."}
{"text":"We have been to this Chompie's several times, and I am always satisfied with my breakfast entree.  I almost always order the French omelet which is delicious.  It comes with home fries and toast and all portions are generous.  I asked for some green Cholula sauce but they only had green tabasco which is not nearly as good.  My husband's experience has been hit or miss.  Today was not outstanding.  He ordered his eggs \"over medium\" but they were served runny.  The server did not stop by soon enough to ask if he was satisfied, so he ate the runny eggs.  When she did stop by, she offered to have the cook remake the eggs, but he declined.  Nevertheless, she did ask the chef to remake the eggs and the second attempt was even runnier.  She then offered a free bagel for him to take home.  His chicken fried steak looked pre-formed rather than hand breaded and the gravy on top was so-so.  He really enjoyed the crispy hash browns and the jalapeno cheese bagel that accompanied his entree.  Prices are a bit high, so when food is not perfectly prepared and/or served, it is frustrating.  The server was adequate, but not especially accommodating or friendly."}
{"text":"Came here at 8:20 well before close and the front doors were locked. I called the number on their front door but they said the power was out even though I can clearly see all the lights on and all the stuff just standing around inside. Called them and they had enough power to pick up the call and tell me they were closing for the night. I asked if I could just buy cakes but they said no to that because their registers weren't up. The thing is I can see the registers have their screen powered on through the glass window and I'm also posting this using their WiFi so I don't understand how the power can be out. I just want to get some cakes."}
{"text":"Finally, a real deli on the west side of town! Been to Chompies on the other side of the valley, so couldn't wait for this one to open. Love breakfast all day and the amount of choices on the menu. And...there's a bar! 

Our order took longer than usual, but our waiter mentioned it before we did and was very apologetic. Food was great. We tried the blueberry pancakes, chocolate chip pancakes and grown up Mac and cheese. Short stack of two pancakes is plenty - no need for the large stack with three. 

Prices are very reasonable. Bakery with cookies, pastries, cakes, bagels and fresh bread is a bonus. 

We will see you again very soon...

Update (July 16, 2016):
1. Had the blueberry pancakes again and they are 2/2 for not including the blueberry compote that is supposed to come with. When it's listed on the menu as part of the item, you shouldn't have to ask for it. 
2. Our waitress this time must have smoked EVERY time she left our table because the smell was just about unbearable when she would come back. Two of us actually had to trade seats to try to mitigate it. Ruined a good meal. 
3. Zach at the bakery counter should be told that when you put cakes in a bag, they should be flat because they get all ruined when sideways. Duh."}
{"text":"I have only been to Chompie's Deli once, and didn't even know they had a location in Paradise Valley. That might be a problem... Because now I am going to eat here all the time! The first time I went to Chompie's, I had yogurt and a bagel. It was great, but I came back for the Jewish Sliders. That's right. They have a menu item known as the Jewish Sliders. They are so famous, they appeared on an episode of Man V. Food. Now, the Kobe beef sliders at The Dynamite Grille at Troon North are the best sliders I have ever had... But the Jew Sliders are delicious!

Chompie's is authentic, the staff is incredible, and I will be back. The server also introduced me to their rewards program. Like I need an excuse to keep eating here. I have already earned $5 off my next meal. 

If you come, order the sliders. You're welcome! Big fan, and can't wait to go back. Oh, and order a meat Knish. They are cheap, hearty and the gravy is to die for. Just an all around great experience for whatever you are in the mood for."}
{"text":"So we love Chompie's in Tempe and wanted to try this one since it is closer.  Though in a mall they do have plenty of seating in and out side. The bakery side allows you to order a bite on the go or some yummy bakery items.  

Pros- same traditional menu and the servers are really nice.  The place is mostly clean and the outside seating area is heated in the winter and cool in the summer. I love the spinach everything bagel with veggie cream cheese.  

Cons- the tables are fit for 4 but the can move stuff around for larger tables.  There is no full booth seating.  While we were sitting at the table the busser cam out and added another table and chair to ours in prep for another large party. Please wait for the first party to leave before preparing for the next.  The western sliders were delivered cold. Timing of the food needed to be better planned."}
{"text":"I went to Chompies for a quick bite during work after hearing the buzz  about the great NY style deli sandwiches on tap. I sat at the bar, though small, it obviously wouldn't be a place I would sit and have a few drinks after work. I was reminded by the manager that they now have a happy hour with $1 off drafts! Good to know. 

I had the Hot Pastrami sandwich with a cup of Tortilla Soup. The size of pastrami was very generous and I barely finished half. The pastrami was stacked 3 inches high and was so tender and juicy. I liked that it had a nice crust of peppery goodness on the edge of each slice. Slap that on Jewish Rye and you're in business!  The soup was good, not great, but good. I don't think it had enough flavor, it was missing a hint of spice and more generous pieces of chicken. It didn't stand out to me.

My only gripe was the NY prices. Out the door with tip was $21, so not an average lunch. I think that would be the only reason why I wouldn't frequent this place more often. Jason's Deli is right across the street and whereas Chompie's pastrami sandwich is better, sadly I don't think it is that much better to warrant the price. 

I'd definitely give it a go. Next time I'll try a reuben!"}
{"text":"I've been to Chompie's multiple times. My family and I tend to go to the pastry section on most of our visits because one thing they can do right is the desserts. Very yummy. However the customer service is HORRIBLE. When waiting to order our pastries, we tend to wait around 10 mins for an employee to notice us or even come towards us at the counter to take our order. We have been ignored and skipped over many times by employees and I don't know why. I really don't want to pull a race card here but when I go in with my father, which is of darker complexion, we are always looked over or the employee goes and helps other customers of lighter complexion first. However when I go in with my mother, which is lighter in color, we get helped within 3 minutes. I've ignored this treatment many times until today, which i why I'm writing this review.
My family and I entered the restaurant and the employee was on the phone, no big deal, we'll wait. Note there was no other customer around to get served. After 4 minutes, she was still on the phone and a couple came in and she acknowledge them and told them she'll be right there with them. Then another customer came in. After waiting for about 7-8 minutes, she helps the couple and the other customer, even though we've been waiting longer. We just left and trust me, we'll NEVER be back. Horrible service!"}
{"text":"Soooo good! The service is amazing! The food is delicious! If you love bagels then look no further, they have all the bagels you can imagine! Oh and don't forget to check out the yummy baked goodies before you go!"}
{"text":"Waffle was delicious, fresh strawberries and whipped cream were perfect.
French toast was also great and filled me up fast. Milkshake was light and yummy. Id recommend to anyone that is a breakfast lover :)"}
{"text":"Day after thanksgiving me and my buddy thought we would have breakfast at Chompies. The place was crowded but we got seated right away. At first glance it looked like any other major deli, but after seeing the menu I saw that they have a different kind of selection. 

Wanting to try a something new I went for the famous \"Original Jewish sliders\" as featured on Man vs Food. They are 2 pieces of challah with latka and and brisket, topped with cheese.  It was great, and It was super filling. I don't know how he had 11 of them. I was full after 3. They are packed and rich with ingredients. 

My friend ordered the Spanish omelet, and he said it wasn't very good, but he finished it cause he was hungry. 

Overall I would have to try more stuff on the menu to really judge this place. The service was pretty good, and friendly, but a lot of the food just looks average."}
{"text":"Decent portion size. Bread was lack luster. Soup was my favorite. Baked goods in separate little store were yummy (we were given samples).service needs a boost and some help. Too much mopping around and not enough hustling."}
{"text":"I love Chompie's! When I went to ASU I'd swing by for brunch every couple of weeks. Now, whenever I go back to Phoenix I make an effort to stop in for brunch. Visited a couple weeks ago and was able to work it into the schedule. They're still fantastic! Extensive menu and nothing will disappoint."}
{"text":"This place went downhill corn beef  is terrible. 

This is definitely no New York style deli. 

Go to Scott's generations on Bethany Home and 7th."}
{"text":"I have been to the Tempe location a few times in the past but never to this location. They have really good everything. Sandwiches and breakfast items. They have a lox and bagel platter for two that is great. Their pastrami sandwiches are awesome. So good. We have ordered sandwiches for meetings for work from here and at lest one person has be come addicted to them.
This time I had been craving pancakes for awhile and I had some time off and was looking for a good place to fulfill my craving. I remembered Chompie's had good pancakes. So off I went. What a great choice. I got the Breakfast of Champions which is two pancakes, eggs and bacon. I also got a side of sourdough toast. Boy did that hit the spot. It was so good I ate all of it. Don't think I ate anything else the rest of the day. The pancakes were nice and fluffy just what I had been craving.
They also bring out a pickle sampler plate with some new pickles and regular pickles. They are so good.
I will definitely be back to order more bagels, lox, pancakes, sandwiches and everything. Oh the pastries in the case are to die for too if you have any room left."}
{"text":"Ok- i use to LOVE Chomies but for some reason the are going down hill.  on thia day i went for brunch with the girla and the waitress screwed up the order, not once but twice.  she didnt bring out all the food and she didnt have the right additional items.  she wrote it down so you would think she wouldnt forget and she would double check her items before she delivered it.  

Pro- the Deli up front was the bomb!  they were quick to get me everything  i wanted and threw in a couple of freebies for me."}
{"text":"There are times when only the word \"appalling\" can be applied. This was one of them .
My friend and I had been to see a movie and were ready for a lunch. The place was very busy do we used the restroom. It was so filthy, we also peeked into the kitchen- and we exited as fast as we could.
I have been to a different location and was looking forward to the same delightful food. But, I did not want to chance it here."}
{"text":"I really like Chompies.  Seems like the only place in Phoenix that has a good deli. I'm from New York and know a good bagel when I eat one.    The food was good.   Love the matzoh ball soup. And the bagels are very good.   The only thing I didn't like and why I didn't give it another star was the pastrami is very fatty and grizzly.  I've heard this from a couple of people also.   Other than Poor quality pastrami everything else was pretty good"}
{"text":"Good food.service not so good waiter sounded tired as if he wanted to go home instead of working"}
{"text":"My first thought upon entering Chompie's, \"what a neat little restaurant\". It's a sit down restaurant, diner style. It's a bakery. It's a deli. All in one.

Right after being seated we were served our drinks and a plate of pickles and cucumber pickles (yes, I know all pickles are cucumbers but these were halfway between still being a cucumber and a full blown pickle). Odd but a delicious and surprising appetizer.

The menu is expansive... I was overwhelmed. I was originally craving a sandwich yet after quickly scanning the menu I noticed there was not a single veggie option. Sad, I moved on and quickly found 3-4 other entrees to decide between.  I finally settled on ordering the Israeli Couscous Fitness Salad *see picture*. It was HUGE and delicious. The lemon infused olive oil dressing was perfection. And I love that it came with a bialy as I badly wanted to try one here. If you are curious it's like bagel only not... it's a yeasty soft centered, crusty on the outside roll. A staple in Jewish and Polish dining. My friend ordered the Fitness Omelet which came with choice of healthy side and a bagel or bialy of your choice. She and I both enjoyed our meals and finished each bite. 

Being a NY style Jewish Deli, I knew not to expect too many vegetarian choices,... there are however a few options, they accommodate special requests, and there is the daily soup which is vegetarian chili.  I was also impressed at the Polish-esque  entrees, I did not try since nothing compares to my grandma's cooking in that department.

Service was friendly and attentive even though the place was quite busy. As a UofA alumni, I could have done without every single server wearing ASU gear but I was in their territory after all."}
{"text":"First of all Leme just say the free cookie I got for reviewing this amazing Deli was incredible. Yumm..... 

We were greeted and seated immediately.
Our server Terreck  was attentive, anticipated our needs before we knew what we needed and frankly the nicest server we have had in a long time. He definitely elevated our #FirstTime Chompie experience. Keep holding it down Terreck were coming back and asking for you! 

We ordered the western sliders with seasoned steak fries and 1/2 Ruben , matzo ball soup and Cole slaw. 

Western sliders were amazing! I'm a brisket girl and this was tender, lean and flavorful! The bread was enough to stand up to the slider and not weigh a lady down. 

The Matzo ball soup did not sound appealing to me but the flavor profile in that soup was like nothing I have ever tasted before. Don't make the same mistake I almost made... try that delicious soup!! 

My guy ate every morsel of his sandwich, with a little spicy mustard he verbalized it's perfection. The Cole slaw did not disappoint either!! It was Creamy, light and crisp. It was NOT over dressed and WAS delicious!"}
{"text":"The service is average...sometimes great, sometimes so so and sometimes awful.  That depends always on your server.  Most of the time, I'm lucky.  The food is very good.  I go often and most of the time leave happy.  Problem is I can't get out the door without my carry home dessert.  Oh boy!  One meal there is big enough for two portions and I take that home as well.  I like the place and will continue going there....especially for breakfast.  Yummm.
Update: June 6, 2014
Went for breakfast this past week.  Got a cold egg and blueberry pancakes with a cold, half frozen compote of blueberries and no syrup.  The server was awful.  For all the good times, this one was worth pointing out."}
{"text":"Love Chompies... Consistently wonderful meals and the selection and quality of the bagels and bialys are amazing! My favorite is the Greek omelet complimented by an onion bialy! Today we experienced quality customer service when we asked for the manager! Bryan displayed compassion towards me personally, as I am struggling with a broken foot! Bryan ensured we were seated for my comfort! Especially impressed since today is a holiday, venue was crowded and Bryan was short staffed!! Kudos to Bryan and his management expertise! We were blessed twice... Our waiter, Nathan, made all of our requests seem inconsequential today!"}
{"text":"Chompie's has the best breakfast and lunch food in Tempe! They also serve breakfast all day which appeals to me in multiple types of ways. The service is always so prompt and friendly, even when they are crazy busy on the weekends. I love eating here and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"yummy yummy. I'm going to have to take an extra hot yoga class for this. just got a everything bagel with a mile high pile of cream cheese, too much cream cheese for the bagel but I'm just gonna eat it with my finger."}
{"text":"7:30 AM 6/13/16 Eggs Benedict for breakfast- food was luke warm and the potatoes tasted like they had been soaked in old used cooking oil. I was disappointed in breakfast this morning.

10:30 AM 6/13/16 I still have a nasty taste in my mouth from that awful meal! It should've been a clue when I walked into the restaurant and there were only two tables of customers. Also I had walked up to the bakery counter first only to see no employees nearby."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Chompies, and I must say the rumors are true... Their Hot Pastrami is the absolute best in AZ. The meat literally melts in your mouth. I loved how there were several choices of bread and cheeses you could choose from. I had mine with Rye and Havarti it was sooooo delicious! I choose Cole Slaw for the side selection I was kind of disappointed about it's small size. I also ordered sweet potato fries, they were okay but I hate that they tasted like they were factory cut. I bought a piece of Red Velvet cake to-go it was okay, I like the Cheesecake factory Red Velvet better. Overall good experience I'll be back. Oh yeah I almost forgot, I ordered a Strawberry shake and they were out of the syrup they normally use to make them, so the manager actually made me one out of fresh strawberries and it was great! My waiter couldn't have been any friendlier either."}
{"text":"Matzo ball soup with noodles? No.  They combined soups.  Chicken strips were just ok. Pastrami sandwich good except for soggy rye bread.  Disappointing. Service just passable. Cleanliness of restaurant barely passable. Zero ambience as tables squished together. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Hello Friends , it's Analynn ... Come on out and try chompie's  amazingly fresh food. Homemade breads, bake goods and all!!!
Word of advice when you order make sure you order half meat on sandwiches , or you will need a ladder to climb up and eatalso, it's a great idea to share . Portions are huge . Do mini salads instead of large . Enjoy friends !"}
{"text":"Sorry to all of you Chompie fanatics, but I have two words to describe this place...EPIC DISAPPOINTMENT! Have heard so many good things about this place from friends, even Adam Richmond (Man vs Food) said it was good. Where to start....I love a good rueben so I ordered the Granpa Rudy with corned beef instead of pastrami, $14.99. The most tastless sandwhich I have ever eaten. The corned beef had NO flavor at all, the cheese was tastless and I am not sure if it even had dressing. It doesn't matter how much corned beef you pile on a sandwich, if it's tastless all you have is a big pile of tastless meat! My gf ordered the sliders. Again the brisket (I think thats what it was suppose to be) was bland as anything, the gravy was so heavy it ruined everything and the potato cakes were burnt, greasy and tasted like they were old. I even took some photos but refuse to post them and give Chompies free advertising. This was a \"been-there-done-that\" moment. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was dry and overpriced service perfunctory. I give the two stars for the Bloody Mary, which was good."}
{"text":"I was reminded this morning why I prefer the Chandler location over this one.  

My breakfast (eggs & bacon with pancakes) was perfectly cooked, but was unfortunately left in the window for far too long.  By the time it got to me, everything was pretty room temperature.  The butter wouldn't even melt that well on the pancakes.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"First I need to say that I enjoy their Leo breakfast. They do a nice job with breakfast where the potato pancakes aren't over done, and the bagels and bakery are good. I think they excel in the schmeer department.This reviews about the corn beef sandwich. The corn beef is a poor quality, and bland taste. The corn beef pales when compared to other delis in the greater Phoenix / Scottsdale area. Almost half the sandwich is fat and not chewable. Also, the bread they use for some reason is about the size of a finger sandwich or slightly bigger. It's too small for a normal sandwich. The coleslaw was also equally tasteless and mediocre. Lastly, the price is two to four dollars more then then other delis in the area for a similar size sandwich, but less than half the quality or test as the others. For a good bagel with a great schemer, Chompies. For a corned beef sandwich, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed with our dinner last night.  Wonderful friendly fast service.  Rye bread was mushy, the crust had no snap.  Sweet & Sour cabbage soup was too sweet.  Chopped liver was sweet, not our style at all.  Chicken Kreplach soup bland flavor was more like \"Campbell's Chicken Noodle\" soup.  Onion Bialy was tasteless, but nicely toasted.  The only thing worth eating were the Bagel Chips.  Nothing else we ordered was enjoyable, but it came quickly."}
{"text":"Four of us went to dinner and we each had the worst meal ever, and I've been a customer for 30 years.   The chicken soup was bland and the matzo ball had no flavor.  The corned beef was served cold and was terrible.   One of us ordered kishka which was inedible.  First it came out burnt, then it came out luke warm and greasy.   The hot brisket was ice cold and tasteless.  And the gravy clotted.   
Not going back!"}
{"text":"OPEN LETTER:
Dear Chompie's Management:  
Last night, Saturday, March 11, 2017, I went to your restaurant rather late and bought a loaf of Sesame Challah Bread.  I gave it to my husband to enjoy with a bit of honey which he loves as a dessert.  When he took his first taste, he immediately told me that the bread was not fresh.  He closed up the loaf in its packaging and placed it on the counter.  I checked for an expiration date and it had none which is unusual since your packaged goods usually have a date.  

Next morning at about 7:30 am, I went to your restaurant to exchange the loaf.  I explained the situation to an older gentleman at which point he became very annoyed.  He put his hands on the loaf and said to me \" It feels fresh to me\".  I could have given him a sarcastic answer such as \"Then, you eat it.\"  but I bit my tongue out of respect.  I would have gladly done an exchange but his behavior prompted me to get a refund instead. 
He began to write up a slip with my name and phone number, throwing the pen toward the cash register when the ink in the pen wasn't flowing fast enough for him---throwing a virtual tantrum.  
I am a long time customer of Chompie's.  I shop there every other day for danishes and baked goods.  Why would I be treated like this?  So nasty.  I hope he is not one of the owners because it doesn't bode well for the restaurant.  
I suggest that you treat your customers with respect even if they have a complaint."}
{"text":"The food here is typically very good. Had the \"fitness\" omelette and it was fantastic. Eggs Benedict was pretty good, great pancakes. Portions are generous. Hash browns quite tasty but breakfast potatoes just average. Servers attentive, kitchen sometime gets backed up but typically a great experience. Sometimes food will come out at different times but it's not too big a deal for me. Front of house staff can be a bit curt. Maybe efforting some New York authenticity? Have a party of at least six and they will take a reservation, and for Sunday brunch you will need one or may be sitting around for 20-30 minutes."}
{"text":"For Breakfast:

Well I decided to try Chompies for breakfast today and I got portobellas again so I must be a gluten for punishment.  I was actually seated in the front today which was cool and my waitress was very nice, but the eggs benedict was not what I was expecting.  The Portobello Benedict is more expensive than all but the one with lox which was kinda sad since I am vegetarian.  They have departed from the standard eggs benedict with not a appealing result.  It comes on a bagel that is supposed to be toasted which is wasn't. So it was cold and chewy and a whole lot of bread in comparison to the rest of the toppings. They also decided to add cheese to all of the different combos which when you combine it with the hollandaise is not a good thing.  And there were only two tiny pieces of mushroom on the whole plate.... so I am not sure what I was charged extra for. Very disappointing there are far better eggs benny in the area ( see my other reviews )  Maybe this place is just not for vegetarians.  If you do go and order the eggs benedict do yourself a favor and get the english muffin ( tell them to toast it ) and skip the cheese.

For Lunch:

When I ate here with some friends in the middle of the afternoon we were seated in the far back corner of the restaurant.  We kind of laughed it off wondering why we were shuttled away to the dark lonely bowels of the restaurant.   I can only guess they have a weird seating chart or the waitress was being punished for some reason.  They were pretty dead so you would think they would want to keep the travel distance to a minimum.  Another group was seated about 10 minutes later across the room from us and they actually had the server move them.

The food was just average at best.  Nothing really stood out on the menu when we were ordering. I got a pretty tasteless Portabella/Goat Cheese salad.  The service we pretty slow, but it might have just been due to the 30 minute hike to our table.  Maybe I'll have to come back by for breakfast."}
{"text":"Used to love coming here especially being arizona native. Greeter FAITH 1st impressions are ever lasting in business. Your leaned and not one smile when putting our name in this morning. You didn't even try to be friendly. Maybe it's just not the job for this hostess working with customers. Won't be back to this location. Thanks"}
{"text":"There is so much I love about chompies. Pastries are great. Love that I can get my fox's u-bet syrup there,lots of stuff. But,even in the newer place in chandler It still feels dirty. I think the atmosphere is just too early bird special. It keeps me away more than I would like."}
{"text":"Went to Chompies this morning for breakfast; two of us ordered the 2 egg special with corned beef.  Came w our choice of how eggs were cooked, hash browns or country fries, and bagel/bialy/English muffin.  We both chose the scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, and English muffin.  Other friend ordered french toast w a side of bacon.  

First, service was slow to put it nicely.  We didn't get water/drinks for over 5 minutes after sitting down.  When the food came, it was mediocre.  The eggs were pretty wet for some reason, the corned beef pretty fatty, and the potatoes were bad!  The bacon that came w the french toast was very overdone.  

The waiter never came back until it was time to pay the bill.  We never got drink refills.  It was just a \"meh\" trip today."}
{"text":"We've been to this location a few time. Good food (salmon latke tapas are amazing!!) but the service is always awful. When I have to go take napkins off another table, go to the bakery for a straw and to-go boxes? Never come back to see how my food is, until after I'm done eating it? You earned your low tip. 

Plus, they had just opened the dining room we were seated in and all the tables were dirty and there was junk on the floor. Eww! It all had to have been there from the night before. Gross. 

Hopefully they get it together before it is too late."}
{"text":"OK first I must admit that I do eat here at least once a month and have for a couple years but thats because there are no alternatives in the East Scottsdale Shea area.  Please someone build a breakfast place here that is smart enough to have free internet.  I can't believe I pay high prices for breakfast at a joint that is to cheap to deliver free internet to their clients.  I always have to sponge off Kinkos and thats painfully slow.  Its 2012 if you sell coffee and breakfast you better offer internet.  The display cases look great but most of the deserts that I have had taste a little stale.  The most impressive thing about this place is the photos of the owner rubbing elbows with all the Hollywood Elite.  Maybe thats why breakfast costs more than $10.00 somebody has to pay for all those expensive friends.  The employees are very nice the coffee selection limited and average tasting.  Bagel sandwiches are good.  I have been informed by employees who work there that they have failed many health inspections so I try to stick to coffee and bagel and avoid the eggs and meat.  All in all very average yet convenient."}
{"text":"Went to chompies with relatively low expectations, after all we're in Phoenix...

From the moment I entered the lobby I knew I has cone to the right place. The staff were friendly and welcoming even on a Sunday afternoon. And the place was packed.  But they found is a great seat on the patio and it didn't take long for the food to start appearing.
In fact, the longest time was spent trying to decide what to have because it's all there. And it's all good.
I couldn't choose between a corned beef Rueben or a pastrami Rueben and our server suggested they make half and half, which they did! That was I could compare side by side. I won't tell you which I preferred yet...
I used my yelp check in offer and got a black and white before lunch. I also had a gluten free brownie for dessert that was amazing!
My lunch mates loved their choices as well. An egg and sweet potato dish with cheese was awesome. And of course the potato pancakes delicious.
The pastrami!"}
{"text":"Hit & Miss...
I've been to every Chompie's in the Valley and so far this one is the most inconsistent.  Last time we were there my husband ordered well done home fries with his omelette and one side of them were raw so the server brought him new ones (almost 20 mins later) and they had been thrown in the deep fryer.  Really?  we didn't ask for fries...  I asked for an everything bagel and let's just say everything didn't make it on the bagel.  It looked like an onion bagel they forgot to finish putting onions on.  A few of the servers are great but some need to find a new line of work...  For having been a huge Chompie's fan for the past 15 years I can't say this location is living up to my expectations of the Chompie's I have known and loved."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad
Service was so bad, that after 10 min in the cashier waiting to order to go, I just left.
And the place was not even that busy.
They need to learn how to run a deli.
Will never go back there!"}
{"text":"I order my wedding Anniversary cake, I brought the picture and ask if they could do it exactly the same, they assure me they can, when I pick the cake up was horrible not the same colors, hardly resembling what I ask. Have to pay for the cake not for the decoration but still have to go home with an ugly cake."}
{"text":"Yes five stars says it all, Chompies is my bagel retreat.  This place has all your kosher goods and we are talking about breakfast through dinner options.  Black and White cookies, check!"}
{"text":"What can I say?  I love love LOVE Chompie's!

Had the 1/2 Rachel's Motown with corned beef and, of course, chicken matzo ball soup.  Delicious.  BFF had the full and Mom had the 1/2 brisket with same soup as I.

Everyone was very pleased with the food, the staff, the atmosphere.  We just love this restaurant.

Before leaving, I had to stop at the bakery and snag a some baklava, rugelach, and Mexican wedding cookies.  Oh my gosh.  Heaven..."}
{"text":"I count myself a Chompies fan; however, I was a bit disappointed in my visit today. I ordered the Gary's Triathlete Omelette which has veggies and feta cheese with egg whites. When my omelet came out, it was distinctly yellow. Clearly there were yolks included. 

I asked the server, \"Isn't there supposed to be egg whites in this?\" He replied he'd check with the cooks. He came back a few minutes later saying he'd asked and the chef said that it was made with egg whites and the yellow color could be attributed to the artichokes... I was thinking \"uh huh sure.\" But I ate it anyway because while I had wanted egg whites, I will eat the yolk (no dietary restrictions, just preference). 

Anyway, another waitress came over and asked if I'd gotten it sorted. I told her the story and she seemed rather curious as to why the omelette was so yellow as well, saying it had happened to one of the plates she served as well. She seemed apologetic. 

Not sure what happened today but those were definitely not egg whites. It ended up being fine, but Chompies, please make sure you check the quality of your fitness omelettes!"}
{"text":"Got our Christmas sides from Chompies - Green beans, mashed potatoes, & bread stuffing. All were fabulous and special made to be dairy free. Great service and wonderful take out. Also, you have to try one of their lemon cookies. Amazing and unique."}
{"text":"Visited 8/2/13.

It has been a while since I have been to Chompie's.  Long before I was involved in Yelp. 

This was a pleasant change. I had order of sliders which were excellent.  I could never finish the challenge!!  Also had Clam Chowder which was very good. Ordered a \"cup\" expecting a small cup and got what I would call a \"bowl.\"

Looking forward to my return for the Monte Cristo. 

Great comfort Deli type food."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience here today for lunch with 5 friends.  I got the Baja Chicken Sandwich, and it was delicious.  The veggies for the sandwich were fresh and the coleslaw was amazing.  The french fries that came with the sandwich, even though they were steak fries, were not soggy and their ranch was really good.  Some of my friends ordered breakfast which was also amazing looking, and they said it was fantastic.  The service was friendly and prompt, making it easier for all of us to enjoy our time together.  All in all great food and a great lunch out with friends!"}
{"text":"Let me say the food here is generally very good. But the service is very poor. Just about all we ordered came out incorrect. Yes generally the waitress fixed the problems, but sometimes not. One small example is our meal was supposed to include a broccoli carrot mixture. My wife can't eat broccoli but was looking forward to the carrots. We received only broccoli so asked for the carrots and they never came. Not a big deal in itself but this happens over and over and has on several occasions. I think they need to train their staff better, and the wait staff needs to verify orders even if their kitchen screws it up. Like I said food is generally good but service is sub par at least in our 4 or 5 experiences."}
{"text":"First, I want to say from my experience, Chompie's food is very good. Not excellent, but very good.  The service, on the other hand was very poor.  Chompie's is a bit on the expensive side. If there service was good, I might accept that but with poor service, I can't give it higher than 2 stars. 

I went to the bakery during lunchtime on Sept. 13th. It was busy so I waited in line like everyone else. As I moved along in line I was asked for my order which included a few bagels, some cookies and a takeout sandwich.  So I'm pulled out of line by one lady who want to ring up my order at this cash register at the stat of the line, not at the end of the line where you usually pay.  I start to take out my wallet and she tells me credit card only, if I want to pay with cash,  I have to get back in line and wait for the OTHER cash register.  O.K. I give her my credit card to pay, but I'm thinking that was annoying. 

She tells me my takeout order will be ready soon. It was a simple bagel sandwich.  So I wait, and wait, and wait. 15 minutes later I ask the lady for the status of this, and it turns out the lady never sent the order to the kitchen so of course its not going to be done.  5 more minutes and its finally done.

They need to get a bit more organized and provide better service, or I can tell you I will never be back.  There are too many other good places around to deal with one that couldn't care less about my business."}
{"text":"This is one of mine and my husband's favorite places to eat here in AZ. The potato pancakes were amazing as always. Everything I have ordered this far has been great!"}
{"text":"This is not a full service Chompies so be warned. If you want the full menu, you have to go to one of the other locations. A disappointment!"}
{"text":"Man I miss this place...  Wonderful food breakfast, lunch or dinner..  Always went for Sunday breakfast...  Service is always fast and friendly..."}
{"text":"Chompie's is our favorite deli!  Great food. Bakery is super good as well. We try something different each time we go. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"VERY disappointing experience!  VERY unsanitary!  We usually do take out because the prices are so high; they decreased portions after raising their already high menu prices.  And they tend to cut corners, like a veggie omelette that had mostly onions.  Gross! 

Recently, my son and I went there for take out of his usual french fries and Elmo cupcake.  After standing by the cash register for a couple of minutes, I yelled, \"Hello!  Is anybody here.\"  A woman finally emerged with a disgusted look on her face and said, \"Yeah.\"  I gave my order of french fries and an Elmo cupcake.  

When she grabbed the cupcake WITHOUT using gloves or tissue paper, I told her to use both and asked why she wasn't using either one.  She gave me another angry look and said, with a patronizing and disgusted tone, \"Because I don't need them!\"  I told her to get her manager, and while we waited, another customer who witnessed this told me that he is an Assistant Manager at a restaurant and that she violated health codes (besides being rude)!  

After the manager emerged, the rude clerk snapped at another customer and then walked by while using her cell phone.  I told the manager what happened and he apologized but didn't look surprised.  He said that he would talk with her.  When I asked if she was a family member or friend of the owners, he said no.

By the way, we were NOT COMPENSATED for this woman's rudeness.  I will NOT return to Chompies.  THEY SUCK!!!"}
{"text":"Really like this place. Had the chorizo omelette and was fantastic. Wish we had one in Goodyear or Litchfield Park on the W side of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Chompies is one of our usual post night shift haunts, and for good reason. They serve large portions of standard breakfast fare, have mimosas and Four Peaks beer on tap, and they're open at 6 am. Zach was our server during our most recent visit, and he definitely made our morning! He's super personable and attentive, and makes the absolute best mimosas. You can't really go wrong with anything on their menu, though my favorites are their skillets. Nearly every dish here comes with a bagel and cream cheese, and you really can't go wrong with any of them. And guys, they have a CRAGEL - croissant bagel. This is not a drill. Throw some honey almond or strawberry cream cheese on there and I'm in heaven! They also have a couple solid breakfast specials during the week if anyone is thrifty like me - standard eggs/potatoes/bagel or bagel and lox. Make sure you stop by their deli/bakery counter for some goodies before you leave - the cannoli and the rugulach are SO GOOD. They also have a decent variety of gluten free options for those with dietary restrictions. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free black and white cookie!"}
{"text":"Excellent all around home food / comfort food! Would recommend to anyone, anytime (breakfast/lunch/dinner) for casual dining."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! (food wise) you definitely get more than you are expecting! My husband & I couldn't eat even half of what we ordered! We had the Jewish sliders and hot pastrami sandwich. Both were delicious but your body feels disgusting after eating there ha if def go back for lunch!"}
{"text":"I have always had a fondness for this place.  I love their corn beef sandwiches a lot.  This place is so close to my house and I wonder sometimes why I do not eat here more often.  
This trip I had the corn beef with a small side of coleslaw.  It was really good.  They have a great pastry case too."}
{"text":"Not our typical Chompie's experience that we get in Chandler. Our server did apologize that no one came help us for a long time and that the hostess shouldn't have seated us where she did, which he shouldn't have told us. We would have moved on and not cared had our good not taken so long or had our sandwiches been hot and good. Our dip sandwich was tough and cold. Our buffalo chicken sandwich was rubbery and had no sauce, dry as could be. Patti melt was beyond greasy. Had this been our first experience at a Chompie's we should probably never go back. Hopefully they just had a really really bad day and this isn't their standard."}
{"text":"We tend to come over here when my FIL visits as he is a fan of liver and onions.  (Not my taste) we usually get Ann assortment of items off the menu.  The service is usually decent,  every now and again we get someone exceptional,  but w don't go often enough to know who they are.  It's always busy and loud which can be overwhelming.  The foods is pretty standard nothing outstanding but definitely not bad. I do love the bakery.  There are not many places to get some of the faves like rugala or black and white cookies."}
{"text":"I was recently on a business trip in Arizona and looking for a place to eat.  We were driving and wanted to try something NOT chain.  The signage was a little misleading, as we thought this was like a small bakery.  I told my co-workers, \"hooooold the phone and let me yelp a bitch!\"  

We were ecstatic to find that Chompie's had an EXTENSIVE menu with all kinds of dee-lish sandwiches and treats, as well as a bakery!  The waitress had to come back to our table like a hundred times because we couldn't figure out what the hell we wanted.  She suggested the pastrami.

OH EM GEE, best pastrami sandwich I have EVER had, EVER!!!!  I hated my fat, bloated salty life the next day, but it was so worth the misery!  We went back to AZ a few weeks later and relied on Chompie's for another amazing meal.  I also had the grilled cheese sandwich....not so much.  Stick to the pastrami and you will be a happy camper!"}
{"text":"Just flew in from Chicago and I had to stop by my favorite breakfast place in Phoenix \" Chompies\" just had a fabulous breakfast on the patio. Weather was great and the food was even better . Service was outstanding as usual. Tammy, Phyllis, Mo, Shea and Ashley are the best. Fast food delivery and my cup of coffee was never empty. These folks really care and I appreciate that! Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food, however it is spendy. There is a deal for Veterans though right now, take your DD214 or something that says you are a Vet and they will give you 50% off."}
{"text":"$12.99 for chicken on a bagel? I ordered it expecting something good, but it was bland at best. Can't remember what it was called, but it was a parmesan bagel with some variant of cream cheese, grilled chicken, grilled onions.  Came with fries. It was seriously lacking for the price. Could've made it at home and wouldn't have noticed a difference except I'd still have 13 bucks in my pocket."}
{"text":"I tried this place hopping to get real NY food but was disappointed. The food was mediocre at best with high prices. What a disappointment. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"Horrible service it was my first time ever going and I stood 15 minutes in the front without anyone acknowledging me or say hello or how many I help you or anything at all and finally when I did have a question about the food she said everything was good and said pick anything I'm never coming back to this place"}
{"text":"OK I was in last night around 7:15.....sat at bar....tall kid there working his butt off...but.....took 5-10 min to get our order...another 5-10 to get my  draft beer ...some curly haired girl w a kid on left end of bar...some kind of former employee.....every other employee in the place visiting w her the entire time she was there...I mean 4-5 people standing around doing nothing while I cannot get service....waiting on everything..place not that busy...winding down...10 min to put Dback game on too....

Now the food.....now in full disclosure I am former deli counternman...but I always come in and ask for 1/2 patrami w/ swiss and please shave it so I can bite thru it..last night they give me huge half sand...bread always crusty cause sitting under light waiting on pickup.....pastrami not shaved...bottom is an inch of hash and junk off slicer....I know the game....good and bad in the pile....but really not very good

I don't know who does the deli slicing but I promise you they  are clueless..CB needs to be cut against grain...I don't even bother ordering that anymore...but It's hard to screw up Pastrami...but they usually do...every 5th time it's right....get these hacks some training or use some QC in what goes out on plates....my two cents...."}
{"text":"It's always nice to find what I consider a real deli when I visit a new city. This place did not disappoint. It's got everything you could ever want. And everything is delicious. From hard-core New York deli style dishes to just a simple bowl of matzoh ball soup. Really really good. Consistently delicious. I've been back a few times. Love it."}
{"text":"Real New York Bagels in Phoenix! I'm so happy!   I had a bagel & a schmear. EXCELLENT service.  I will be back. Often."}
{"text":"So enjoy this restaurant! Good food and atmosphere! Today Sean waited on us and was very helpful! We both enjoyed our sandwiches! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Stay away from Chompie's if you're at all trying to 'watch what you eat'.. from the time you walk in and are greeted by the vast display of goodies and pastries.. to the extensive menu that offers everything from all-day breakfast dishes like challah roll french toast to mile high sandwiches, you will likely be un-successful in ordering, much less consuming something that is figure friendly.  

Well I have been eating waaay too many salads this month, so I was really hard up for some meat and some tasty animal fat... wasn't wanting to go all out, but I definitely wanted a non-salad meal, heavy with protein & animal fat.  I didn't exactly pick this place (it was more of a group decision), but it would have to do.  

Our party of 4 got seated quickly during prime Fri lunch time and commenced to read the literary novel that is their 15 page menu (ok, maybe more like 8)...  'I want some meat, a big ass hunk of meat... ooh, there's a mile-high pastrami... nah.. OOoh, how bout sliders?.. nah, too much bread..  fish?...ooh, they have all-you-can-eat fish & chips today???... FOCUS April! you're looking for MEAT... alright... maybe a burger?.. yeah.. gluten free bread?.. hmm.. not bad.. why not?.. oh yeah, AND with BACON on it.. and some cheese!'  There! I had gone through all my meat-options on the menu and settled on a huge bacon cheese-burger with a Gluten-Free bun and side of sweet potatoes.  

When the order came up, it was ginormous!  Actually, ALL our orders were huge plates, plentiful with fries and those who got mile-highs were also stacked high with sandwich meat.  We all walked out stuffed and some with to-go boxes.  I tried the fish & chips and it was decent (not better than the fish I've had at FIbbers, but decent).  I wasn't underwhelmed with my Gluten-free bun.  It was tall and had a small diameter (like a muffin), so it was very awkward to eat it as the 'bun' when the huge diamater meat patty hung over... so I just removed it and had the patty, bacon, and cheese solo.. and of course some fries.  BTW, their fries were, across the plates at our table, soggy and not crisp (my table partners didn't like that, but I love soggy fries, so I can't complain.. apparently, soggy is not the popular vote for fries).

All in all: quick seating at lunch time, friendly waitress did her job, manager came by to great us, food was huge portions, soggy fries, odd GF bun, great selection of deserts, overwhelming lunch menu... immediate lunch food coma."}
{"text":"My last experience with Chompie's was a horrible one. I was given the name and number of the corporation manager. As soon as he heard my name he denied it ever happened before I told him what had happened.  Instead of a deserved apology he claimed the incident never took place, so it was my word against his! Calls to the owners were not returned. Needless to say they have lost all my future business including catering. In contrast I took friends to Joe's Farm Grill last week. The ribs were slightly undercooked. I complained only as a favor to the restaurant, not expecting a thing. Their corporate manager found me and gave me back a full refund on the two dinners I had purchased plus a $100 gift certificate!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a big and filling breakfast. Chompies is the closest thing to an authentic Jewish deli in Arizona. Huge menu selection and they serve breakfast all day. Goes without saying, but the Jewish Sliders are a must have. You won't leave here hungry because the portions are humongous. Always have great service and everyone is very friendly."}
{"text":"Food is very good, portions are large, service is great! My only complaint is that it's a little on the pricey side. An extra $3.50 for onion strings instead of potato salad? Geez. Still, will definitely be back when I can afford it."}
{"text":"Wouldn't redeem check in offer after server directed me to the deli counter to redeem. Employee was rude."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Chompie's with my Dad since 2008, my first year at Arizona State. We immediately fell in love with the friendly service and delicious food. It quickly became our go to breakfast spot. I usually get a bagel sandwich just because I love them, but their home style cooking is beautifully done and anything on the menu is most likely a tasty choice. The owners are actually from New York and carry a nostalgic feel throughout the open kitchen. Concept and the dessert cases up front. Don't forget to grab one on the way out, they are pretty hard to miss and harder to pass up!"}
{"text":"My mother had been in South Korea for over 2 years, and when she returned to the states this weekend, all she wanted was a pastrami sandwich. So we jumped on yelp and found Chompie's. I was a little hesitant as there were some mixed reviews, but we decided to go with it, and I'm so glad we did! We both had 1/2 \"Mile High\" pastrami sandwiches and the pastrami was delicious and juicy. My mom had the combo with a bowl of clam chowder which was thick and delicious. I noticed people complaining about the prices, but found the 1/2 sandwich combo to be more than enough food and quite reasonable at about $10 per person. We also ordered one of the turkey sliders which was actually the highlight of the whole meal. With the gravy and cranberry and that delicious latke all on a soft challah roll. Yum! We didn't experiences the poor services that other yelpers had complained about. In fact, I often gripe about the terrible service here in the Valley and I thought our waiter was exceptional. He was attentive and personable and overall we had a great experience. We will definitely be back! And this time we will save room for some of those delectable looking desserts from the case!"}
{"text":"Why is it that despite the fact that my house in North Central Phoenix is located right across the street from a large synagogue, it seems that I have to drive to the East Valley to find a good Jewish deli and bagelry.

Chompie's has an overwhelmingly large menu and the service by many young college girls that they employ as waitresses is very eager and friendly. The food has always been good and the price is fair because of the overwhelming quantity of food that you receive.

We stopped in yesterday for lunch after visiting the ASU Art Museum for Family Fun Day. My wife had a large bowl of split pea soup, the kids split a chicken fingers and a chocolate-chip bagel and I had the Mitch's Brooklyner sandwich which is a three layer sandwich consisting of pastrami, corned beef and brisket on rye.

The other thing I love is that Chompie's is one of the few places that still sells salt bagels which are my favorite.

Now I'm not Jewish and I'm not from New York, so I'm sure that there are those who would disagree, but Chompie's is far and away the best option for a deli and bakery that I have found in the Valley."}
{"text":"I went to Chompie's twice in one week, as I am sans-kitchen and it is nearby. I went the first time for lunch, had the pastrami sandwich (half) and the second for dinner and had the cobb salad. For the price of the sandwich and a drink, $14, I did not think it was worth it at all. The pastrami was nothing special and for a NYC style deli (yes I have been to many in NYC and out) the size did not even come close to what I expected. My second experience was much better. I paid less this time and got a huge cobb salad with an abundance of toppings. From the other orders I saw, and the price variations this place really depends on how hungry you are and what you are prepared to pay. Over all service was very friendly, no complaints there!"}
{"text":"I love Chompie's a lot. I've been all over the valley and have gotten pretty good service at the Paradise Valley and University locations. This one just dropped the ball.

I decided to grab a few quick things from the bakery, wasn't even going to sit to eat. I wasn't even greeted by the 2 people standing at the door. I don't usually care about that but it was just another thing atop everything else. After I get inside, I see multiple people waiting around for someone to come to the bakery to be helped, someone finally does and the employee walks away. Its my turn now and are ready to order. 

I stood around for a good five minutes until I started looking for someone to help. As soon as I found the hostess, she started walking away. Listen, I understand that there are plenty of responsibilites of each employee but I didn't even get a look from her. After walking back towards the register, I see an employee writing something down, I think it may have been the manager or something because they didn't look like a waitress. I kind of look at them and they look right back at me and look back down to continue writing something down. No \"can I help you?\" or \"can I get someone for you?\". I eventually just lost all hope at that point and left.

Like I said, I love Chompie's. Their jewish sliders and assorted bakery items are off the charts, but this location just fell flat. Me and my friends won't ever step foot in there again. If you have the choice, go to the one on University. Much better service."}
{"text":"As a person that grew up in NYC I can tell you that whatever it is they think they serve is nothing but delusion on a plate.
Not to mention this was my THIRD time to go there after giving it more than one chance. Let's start with the food - maybe at one point when they were first founded it was done with care but now it seems like the cooks do not really want to come into work. The \"turkey Ruben\" was basically a hunk of old turkey soaked in grease and put on hard as a rock bread that was brought back to life with more grease before adding butter and toasting the minerals out of it, add a slice of American cheese and a hand full of cole slaw that was thrown in the air and whatever landed on the sandwich stayed, $11 for that is a disgrace. I returned it as I was just appalled by such disrespect for food, the manager came out what must have been 15 minutes later to \"talk\" to me - that turned into him arguing and yelling at me before leaving the area and slamming the door. Into service - every time I have been there it was usually empty to medium business and without fail it takes about 45 minutes to get the appetizer every time. Now you'd think it would be fresh and piping hot - nope, it was luke warm at best and had a microwave taste to it. If I was at some coney in south Phoenix I wouldn't care but in Scottsdale and for $40... Not gonna happen."}
{"text":"Great potential, but they need to make some changes.  The food and the service could definitely be improved (I guess that coversjust about everything...lol).  After you're seated, you need to keep an eye on your server in order to get additional coffee, utensils, condiments, and even the bill.  The table behind us had to get their own utensils and condiments.  

Now, the food has potential but I'm not sure about the cook.  The home fires are too greasy, the toast is only toasted on one side, and the over medium eggs  were cooked the same as you would cook them for a fried egg sandwich.  And to top it off, the food was lukewarm.  Don't the cooks every taste their own food ?

So, as I said before, they have the potential to be rated 4/5 stars, but currently, I can only give them a 2."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I came to have lunch this past Wednesday, and a very large cockroach ran by our table while we were perusing the menu. After that, my friend and I just could not eat there. Please clean this place up! It would be a shame if it has cleanliness issues that are pervasive!!!"}
{"text":"I had to wait at the counter today while Scott J complained to his employee about another customer. What a rant he was on and how unprofessional. It explains to me why there are so many problems and this place is so unprofessional."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch. Although this location in inside the mall, with an entrance both from the outside and from inside, the restaurant itself is nice and spacious and we were seated quickly.

Huge menu with tons of options. They tend to be on the more expensive side as far and sandwich prices go, but they don't disappoint with portion size. Meats, breads, and sides are all fresh and just about worth the price tag. They also have a gluten free menu (as well as a GF kids menu).

I had the Rachel Motown (corned beef) on grilled sourdough instead of rye. It was huge but I managed to eat the whole thing. It came with a large side of fries and I substituted the coleslaw for potato salad because there is slaw on the sandwich. After doing that I realized that I now had two potato items. The potato salad is good but I should have kept the slaw since there was minimal on my sandwich.

Kids had a grilled cheese with fries and a burger on a GF bun with fruit salad. Both enjoyed their meals.

Even if you aren't spending your day at the mall, I would still recommend coming here to eat...fairly easy to get in, park, and leave when you are finished. If you are mall walking, this is definitely better than anything you are going to find in the food court."}
{"text":"One of the things I love the most in life is reconnecting with friends after several years.  I also love having random meaningful conversations with people I don't know. And, of course, I ADORE brunch.

Today was the trifecta!!

   I met up with my darling friend, Orysia for brunch at Chompie's and we ended up meeting a lovely group of women at the next table, who are going to teach us Mahjong!  They were just adorable snd I was so honored to hear their stories of lives well lived

It goes without saying that the food is fantastic!  I had the hash and eggs; my friend had cabbage soup.  As always, it was perfection.Jessica was our server and she was fantastic AS ALWAYS.

The entire experience was just lovely!"}
{"text":"Great food all around. The pickles they give you to start have an odd taste, but are hard to put down. I normally get the Jewish sliders (not MvF style) with a side of their delicious fries. Overall very satisfied. The wait staff is very friendly and the New York atmosphere makes the experience very enjoyable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I just want to say i brought my family here for their visit today we had an amazing lunch and Shea Is an amazing server and i was so impressed and happy we chose to come here."}
{"text":"I love this location, the service, and of course the food. Weather you come here for breakfast, lunch, or dinner; the food is delicious. I prefer to come here for brunch and get their potato pancakes or their lox and bagel. Besides their breakfast food, I do enjoy their bakery items. Weather it's their black and white cookie, sugar cookies, or brownies, these are mouth watering."}
{"text":"LOVE Chompie's!!! Probably one of my favorite places in Scottsdale for casual eating.  My friend and I go every Saturday mornings after hiking with the dogs. Obviously since we bring the pups we sit outside. I have to say, I am shocked at reading about the terrible service. In the three years I have gone here at least once a week, we have never had terrible service. There is one waiter who I don't think likes serving the patio people (or maybe it's just us dog people) but everyone else is amazing. We're barely there for 5 min and they are out with water bowls for the dogs, coffee for me, and a diet coke for my friend. 

On to the food. It's thanks to Man vs Food, and my mom, that I found Chompie's. She had seen the episode and since I was moving to Phoenix, she wanted to try. Now every time she visits we have to go at least twice. She has gotten everything from french toast to reubens to chicken and waffles --  and she's loved it all. Her favorites are the sandwiches because they are enough food for 1-2 more meals!! Having celiac's disease, I have to go with what's on the GF menu, but I still love it. My go-to is the GD Bagel w/lox platter. It is so yummy and filling. The rare times I don't get that, I will get the reuben or GF waffles. The pups always get their plate of bacon.

Chompie's is now carrying a variety of GF deserts and pastries, which I love!! My non-gf friend and I will occasionally split a chocolate and peanut butter brownie. I'm lucky I have the dog or I would go in before I left and buy more for home.

Well that it is. We'll be at Chompie's with the danes tomorrow for our post hike brunch like we are every weekend!"}
{"text":"Chompies' food lives up to the pictures!! I recommend the 12 slider challenge platter. You don't have to do the  challenge, just eat the sliders with someone else. Very filling and very good. Did NOT like the matzo ball soup."}
{"text":"My girlfriend Anna and I LOVE this place.  We've been here twice before and will be here many times in the future.  Anna is from New York and she can attest this is the closest thing AZ has to a NY deli.  Huge, delicious portions.  YUM!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has decent food, but their service is never very good. They CONSTANTLY mess up takeout orders."}
{"text":"The Ruben was just to die for, I relished every bite. One of the best corned beef sandwiches I've had, right up there with the famous Schwartz's Deli in the Jewish quarter of Montreal. They had clam chowder that day and it was some of the best I've had as well, and that's saying something, right? The service was alright, they took my order, brought me my sandwich, were polite, what else do I need? Oh and the half-sandwich deals make a lot of sense as the sandwiches are monsters that can probably feed a whole family. Even the half sandwich made me feel pretty damn full, and I am not a wimpy eater.

Update 4/30/12: I went here again today and I decided to lower my review from 5 stars to 4. Got the Ruben again and though it was really good, I realize it is just not quite up to the revered 5 star level. Can I re-emphasize how enormous these things are? I ate like half of half of the sandwich, which was just loaded with corned beef, and felt so full I had to wimp out on the rest."}
{"text":"\"Yummy stuffed French toast\".   Sinfully delicious cherry filled challah bread, deep-fried, topped with powdered sugar and whipped cream. Calorie packed but worth it."}
{"text":"If you go to Chompies, be hungry because the portions of everything are HUGE! The only reason I took off one star is because carrying out all the leftovers made me tired!"}
{"text":"My guy and I decided to stop in for breakfast.... what a disappointment!!! We waited half an hour before the waiter  came over to report that they had no Pumpkin bagels, which is something I was looking forward to. When the food arrived, his eggs were overcooked, the corned beef hash was overcooked, and my scrambled eggs were even overcooked. Scrambled eggs? Seriously? We will not coming back to this location again"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?

I have a penchant for Jewish delis since I've lived in LA for several years. My favorites out there being: Canter's and Jerry's. Yeah, hate on me. I like what I like.

Today, it was time for something a little different for lunch. I was sick of eating leftovers or a Trader Joe's salad. I hopped onto Yelp and read some of the reviews of this place since it seems that Chompie's has quite the reputation around town.

I pulled up the menu and was surprised to find out that there is a \"Fitness Boot Camp\" menu. Most items here are reasonable...somewhat. This is a Jewish deli afterall....a glutton's paradise. I ordered the Mile High Turkey Pastrami on Multi Grain Bread with Fruit Salad. My tomato, lettuce and onion was all on the side. No condiments on the sandwich. Perfect. I didn't need to request it this way. Thank God.

When I came in to pick it up, the person who prepared my sandwich, opened up the box, went over my sandwich with me to make sure it was everything I asked for. AWESOME SERVICE.

I walked out of there with a smile. 

The sandwich was delicious. The turkey pastrami was NOT dry, the bread was fresh, the fruit was perfect, and I was a very happy camper. 

I can't wait to come back! Chompie's....you are awesome. Challah!"}
{"text":"I should have written a review months ago.  My friend and I came in Christmas Day.  The place was crowded but our waiter was great.  Food perfect, as always, and nice and hot.  I got a half sandwich, soup and slaw.  The pastrami was tender and juicy and the Matzo ball soup was so delicious.  I thought the slaw was so so but I am not a slaw fan. Overall on a hugely busy day, moreso than Sundays are, this was great and the food nice and hot."}
{"text":"I was in need of a comfort food fix and to me that means Delicatessan... Chompies was close by and most of the reviews looked good so I gave it a try.

My waiter Dane was very nice and service was great.

I started with matzo ball soup and wasn't dissapointed although I did find a bone in mine I wasn't turned off or upset, in fact it proved that they make the soup from real chickens not just store bought broth and it tasted like it...yummy.  I also had the hot pastrami which was tasty as well.  

I would definitely retuen when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I ordered the Baja Burger. I said Baja Burger. When the food came, it looked like chicken. I said, \"I ordered a burger.\" The waitress replied, \"It's a chicken burger.\" Being the reasonable person I am, I assumed I hadn't been paying attention (which has been known to happen) and wondered to myself why they'd put a 'chicken burger' in the burger section. I mean, I read the description - it said nothing about being chicken. Whatever, it looked good so I chalked it up to me not paying attention and let it go. The 'chicken burger' was delicious. So good. I was very pleased.

The service was pretty slow, especially after we got our food. The hostess cleared our plates and we waited patiently - for who knows how long - for our waitress to come back by. She finally dropped the check, at which point we waited a while longer - long enough for me to take a leisurely trip to the restroom - before she finally came back by to retrieve the check and run my card.

On the way to the restroom, I passed the kitchen where I saw the waitress either doing her sidework or checking out others' sidework. Either way, I had my answer as to why the service slowed to a crawl.

Oh, and on that check was printed, \"Baja Chicken Sandwich.\" I checked the menu on my phone to make sure I wasn't losing my mind. I wasn't.

I said burger."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need some eggs and corned beef hash.  Today that combo sounded heavenly so we headed out, braving the pre-superbowl crowds that are ALL over town right now.

The wait was roughly 30 minutes but we amused ourselves by looking at the beautiful baked goods and indulging in some yummy hot coffee.

As always, the food was great.  Lovey came by to greet us, and our servers were really on top of things.

I love this place.  It's consistently good, consistently welcoming, and consistently enjoyable.  Chompie's is an Arizona institution."}
{"text":"Pretty good... being from NY, it is hard to find a real Jewish deli out here. And while this is still nowhere near a NY deli, it is an ok substitute. Their matzo ball soup is pretty good, and so are the bagels :) I eat here when I am on this side of town often."}
{"text":"Coming from Michigan which has one or two outstanding Deli's, Chompie's was a huge disappointment.  Their corned beef was lousy compared to Vienna brand.  Their prices are beyond ridiculous.  I will continue my search for a good Jewish Deli in Arizona."}
{"text":"Chompie's has far and away the best bagels in town. Not the cardboard-tasting, dry, processed junk you get at Einstein's. Chompie's actually taste like the good bagels you get in New York. Plus, they're still the only place in town that sells salt bagels and they're kosher. Unfortunately, it only gets 4 out of 5 stars because it's too pricey and the dining room is pretty boring."}
{"text":"This is a must-stop place if you're in Phoenix. Great menu that appeals to just about any mood your stomach is in (e.g., breakfast, diner, deli). Plenty of options and they're all delicious!"}
{"text":"Okay sandwiches but the To Go counter help needs to be trained better.  Really have no clue about their own restaurant..and when a bubbie is picking like a 1000 different cookies for passover..maybe get some help so orders can be taken."}
{"text":"Went here this morning to get a bagel and lox cream cheese.  The lady helping me did not put on new gloves when making my food.   After she made my bagel, she touched everything with the same gloves on -- the register, money, the pen, counter.  (The register is never cleaned and is touched by every employee, and the pen is touched by nearly every customer.).  Then she did not change her gloves after ringing me up and will make the next customer's food.  That is SO gross.  I can only imagine what she touched before making my bagel.  What is the point of wearing gloves when you do not change them between touching common items such as pens and registered and MONEY!  Money is incredibly dirty. I am repulsed.  Chompie's needs to work on their food handling and glove use protocol."}
{"text":"Being on the lookout for gluten-free things since I \"converted\" last summer, I am still kicking myself for not knowing that Chompie's, a Tempe favorite and practically a historic landmark at this point, has a bakery which makes gluten-free cookies! But that's all they make. I Googled \"gluten-free tempe, az\" and came up with a website compilation of G/F places nearby. Chompie's was one of them, so I investigated.

I asked the kid behind the counter if they had gluten-free things, and he said yes. I asked what they had, and he pointed to a stack of unlabeled cookies in plastic containers. That was the first oddity--that they were unlabeled. G/F things should be labeled (for allergy purposes). The second was that was ALL they had, aside from a frozen hamburger bun (see Fry's frozen food department for better and cheaper buns). The ONLY good thing about the cookies were that it was $2.50 for 8 of them. They were mediocre at best. (again, see Fry's for better cookies). I am disappointed that there is no one in north Tempe/south Scottsdale/east Mesa that has cornered the gluten-free bakery market. Otherwise, I have to drive to south Tempe to get a decent cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"Oy ve iz mir!

Not to be a kvetch....but I consider myself to be an expert on Jewish delis.  As a New Yorker from a predominantly Jewish area and married to a Jew, I've had more than my fair share of experiences at them.  My husband and I woke up this morning with a burning desire for a good bagel, corned beef on rye, and a knish.  So I schlepped all the way up to the PV Mall to get it.

Ok, first of all, the decor is terribly schlocky.  Its kind of like the tourist trap Jewish deli you find in Times Square.  Its like a Disney version of a NY deli.  

I take my number and head over to the cold case to get some drinks....of course they didn't have regular lemon Snapple (and why should they?  Its not like every deli, pizza place, and convenience store in NY carries it....) but they did have Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray which is always a welcome sight.  Another thing they had in the cold case which I found to be odd were jars of Nathan's pickles.  Nathan's, like the hot dog place.  I would imagine a Jewish deli would have Ba Tampte pickles....I didn't even know Nathan's made pickles!  It was a little lame to be honest.

Anyways, I go up to the counter where there doesn't seem to be anyone working.  There was no organization to it.  So I waited.  And waited.  In New York, the deli is a finely tuned machine designed to move people quickly.  Chompie's? Eh, not so much.  When I finally did place my order, the guy who took it had a hard time punching it into the computer and asked me to repeat it several times.  Despite saying I wanted my bagel toasted several times I was given a cold, untoasted bagel.  I waited a little longer for my order to come up and went on my merry way.  

Here is the breakdown of the food we ordered-

Matzoh ball soup- Surprisingly good.  I have never had matzoh ball soup with carrots and celery...so much chazerei!  Just give me the matzoh ball! Although, I will admit, it was solid.  I wouldn't go all the way to Chompie's for it because I know that I can make it better in my own kitchen. 

Plain bagel \"toasted\" with cream cheese- Terrible.  The bottom of the bagel was entirely too thick and was very hard.  They didn't even cut it all the way through, probably because the crust is too thick! 

Corned beef on rye- Meh.  The corned beef wasn't very good, it wasn't corned enough.  If they make their own they didn't use a piece of brisket that was fatty enough.  The rye (which was not marble rye...) was lackluster.   It couldn't handle the corned beef, became soggy, and eventually fell apart.  The pickle it came with was the grossest thing I've ever seen.  And it was definitely a kosher dill, even though I asked for a half sour.  The potato salad was actually really good though.

Knish- Terrible.  The knishes in my elementary school cafeteria were better than this.  First of all, the outer crust was way too flimsy.  It should have been much, much, thicker, especially considering the gargantuan size of the knish.  We essentially ate a large plate of mashed potatoes.  The potato inside itself was unremarkable.  Not only do I have this Jewish thing going on but I'm also Irish....I've never met a potato dish I didn't like.  Until today.  I didn't even finish my half of the knish. 

Now for the prices.  What's with this meshugas?  $2.29 for a bagel with cream cheese is a tad much.  In NY they run you about $1.35.  The corned beef sandwich was $12.50!  Now, I've paid that much for sandwiches in NY before but you get 2 lbs of meat and several layers of sandwich!  This was not a $12.50 sandwich.  I was also going to get us some whitefish salad to sample but at $15.99/lbs it wasn't happening.  

Why anyone should schlep all this way, in this heat, schvitzing all over, for this dreck?  I don't know!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in the other day after a Dr appointment for lunch. This place is by far one of the best we have been to since moving to the Valley! The hostess was the sweetest ever and got us settled in the back to then gave us the full scope on the restaurant and chain. The food was by far some of the best we have had in years. Felt like I was back in Italy.....deserts were astonishing as well to say the least! We've already told our closest friends and have set the date to return. My wife swears this is now her go to place! I'll drive. :-)"}
{"text":"Chompies used to be our favorite but this location continues to fail.  My salad seemed to be a smaller portion (they have summer portion of what I ordered) but they charged me the full amount.  It was average at best.  I thought the salad used to be served with some garlic toast or bread but nothing but the salad in a small white bowl was provided. 

The one star comes from what they served my 9 year old. She ordered french toast with bacon. They served her one slice of bread made into french toast and cut in half.  That's it! Literally a single piece of bread and water for $4.99!  Seems a little ridiculous?!  We asked for the bacon that was included which they brought 5 minutes later. I complained about the portion so we were given another piece of french toast bread.  My 7 year old ate the 3 chicken strips which were good.

Chompies has always been known for their generous portions so this was very disappointing!  The restaurant was empty so I would guess they are working on cost savings by providing less food.  Service was slow for an empty restaurant.  

PS - The pickles were all mushy and gross.  Not at all Chompies standard.

I expect this location will shut down soon....that bad!"}
{"text":"I have been there three times, the first time was okay.  

The second time I took my son and we ordered the Reuben and breakfast.  The Reuben  ($17 sandwich) was disgusting, it was so fatty it was barley edible.  I didn't eat it and no one asked me about it, they just took it away.  Also the place was disgusting and dirty.  The floor was full of bagels I almost slipped going to the bathroom.  This was like this for the full hour we were there, and I mentioned someone should clean it up before they slip and fall.  

Third time behind the deli counter was disgusting again, I don't think they clean at all.  This time I tried the cabbage soup base to see if I would like it, too sweet, not my thing, so I ordered their Chicago Dog with sauerkraut - gross.  However my son loves the pancake breakfast - so we may go again just for that."}
{"text":"As soon as I saw the Man vs. Food episode that featured Chompie's Jewish sliders, I knew that I would have to eat here at some point in my life.  It was love at first sight!

I have to say that when  finally did make it here, they were not disappointing.  Beef brisket with latkes on challa bread -- these guys are geniuses!  The Cowboy sliders with onion strings and barbecue sauce on them were pretty darn good as well.  Everything was so good in fact, that I took 4 sliders in a box for my drive back to the bay area the next day!

I was also able to try some local beer, as well as some of their soup, which was all good!  Their bakery looked pretty amazing as well, but I filled myself up on all you can eat sliders, so I didn't get a chance to try any dessert.  It's ok though.  It was worth it.  

My only complaint is that there isn't a Chompie's near me!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a real deli sandwich so were did I go Chompies! MILE HIGH pastrami was what I needed ordered the full could not finish took picture of the half I didn't eat. Ordered a side of adult mac & cheese food but nothing special but the pastrami was the bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here, but have stopped going because of the atrocious service I received on my last visit.  I will admit they do have some decent food and, depending on who you get as a server, the service can be decent too.  However, my last experience was just over the top.  My companion and I started off by ordering two coffees.  After waiting for about 15 minutes, the waiter finally came back with two cups of coffee, one of which was only half full.  We both stared with puzzlement at the coffee and when he came back a short while later, I pointed out the curiosity before us.  He looked down at the two cups, laughed, and then proceeded to pick up the full cup and pour part of its contents into the one that was only half full.  In the process, he spilled part of the coffee all over the table and then left us staring in bewilderment at the two, now semi full cups, and the puddle of coffee before us.  After another tedious waiting period, he finally came back for our order and when we pointed out the puddle of coffee on the table, he again snickered and sloppily sopped it up with a rag.  The remainder of the breakfast was similarly sloppy in service."}
{"text":"I used to go to Chompies every week to meet with a friend of mine who lived in NYC for many years.  We liked that we could eat breakfast at any time of the day which is pretty common for this type of restaurant mostly found on the east coast. They allow for lots of modification on entrees and are pretty lenient when it comes to substitutions.   For example I used to get an egg white omelette with 4 or 5 fillings - and most servers went out of their way input the order in the most cost effective way.  

I recently went to Chompies to get some bakery items which I have never done before.  The cookies and cupcakes are visually very appealing and look and taste fresh.  These make for a nice leave behind at meetings or sales calls."}
{"text":"This is my \"go-to\" for coffee and a sweet after walking the mall. Met a friend for dinner on a Friday eve. Dinning area was way under staffed this night. To the rescue Susan the hostess, was wonderful trying to make our experience a good one. And then came the G/M who worked every table to see that the guest had what they needed. He worked between the kitchen staff, and single server to make what started as a nightmare, a pleasant ending. Yes the food was good, but the employee reaction to a difficult situation was outstanding."}
{"text":"Guess they make the best bread In town and they have fresh cream cheese. I want to try their Bobka some day. 

That also have a cute little bar and some good relaxing music .. Good place for a quick brunch or lunch on a weekend"}
{"text":"I eat at Chompies often, but last night may be the last time.  The service was so bad that I would say it was the worse I have ever experienced.  The young man forgot the order, sent chicken noodle soup to the table when it was to be matzo ball soup.  Returned with a cold matzo ball to put in the soup.  Forgot the other soups and then brought them cold.  Forgot the drink and after dinner he brought it, but stopped at the wrong table to deliver it.  Took back one of the cold soups to warm it up and then did not bring it back till others were finished with dinner and also delivered the Reuben sandwich at the same time.  Did not bring the ketchup and we had to get up and get it from another table.  Also needed napkins, but did not see anyone to ask, so got our own.  The food was bad.  I always order a chopped liver sandwich and this time the liver was in large pieces, so you had to chew it.  The Reuben had very little sauerkraut; you could not even find it on the sandwich.  The check was wrong, and we had to get up to pay at front desk, except for all of the above everything was fine."}
{"text":"Wow. Stopped by while in Tempe on business and looking for a quick lunch. Am I glad I did. A very good NY style deli serving all the staples and then some. I went basic, the Ruben Combo, for $9.99.

The split pea soup was yummy, I could have had a large bowl of just that, but I would call the brisket Ruben FANTASTIC. Flavorful, fresh yummyness. Also a very good slaw. Add to this the fast and friendly service and you know I will be back!"}
{"text":"Chompie's is alright as far as bagels go.  They are too doughy for my taste but they are certainly better than chain bagels.  It's a huge deli which is always a welcome sight.  I wasn't  terribly thrilled with the whole pour your own coffee thing but now I know for the future.  (I don't drink coffee, but my husband does....I hate being responsible for it if it sucks!)  I am an avid Snapple drinker and I was excited to find that they carry it, if only a very limited selection.  

I was very impressed with the large dessert selection that they have; including my favorite, tri color cookies."}
{"text":"This was a great find for us. Our breakfasts were hot and delicious. I loved that they had organic teas and gluten free options!  We were visiting from Las Vegas and wished we had a Chompies there!"}
{"text":"This place is super good! 

First of, food variety is delicious. Many different combination of dishes and add ons.

Second, their coffee is delicious!!. 

The choices of beagles are HUGE AND AMAZING, obviously freshly made at the store.
The have an are for quick to-go meals with soooo many tasty options too.

Cozy spot to enjoy a meal.

Staff is very friendly and courteous.

Decent prices for their meals plus a great location. 
Good luck guys!!"}
{"text":"Guy seemed very out in space......very slow, seemed confused and annoyed. Hope the foods good..."}
{"text":"Chompies, I wanted to love you, but you missed the mark. I grew up surrounded by Jewish delis, and had been sincerely missing that being in Arizona. They have classic Jewish favorites and the matzo ball soup, and bagels were hits for our group. However, the quality of food and the service were not consistent throughout the meal. We had to ask multiple times for the complimentary pickles to be delivered to the table, and they arrived as we were finishing out meal. The dish I ordered, someone in the kitchen decided to add bacon to, which very much upset this vegetarian. I was offered another meal, but when I didn't particularly trust anything coming from the kitchen at that point. The meal was comped, which was appreciated, but it didn't change the fact that I was extremely let down by a meal that I was looking forward to. At this point, I have no desire to visit Chompies in the future."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the sit down portion of the restaurant, but it's a great place to stop in and get bagels. The bagels are definitely better quality then your average bagel place, and they have a nice variety of toppings for them. I ordered a veggie delight, and while I wish it had had more avocado, it had the right portions of everything else. My friend also had a great idea to get a few sides of breakfast potatoes to accompany the bagels. The home fries were awesome, sautéed with onions with the perfect amount of seasoning. Warning though, anything coming from the actual restaurant takes much longer than just getting a bagel, and the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Chompies bagels or the bakery sweets. Think the baked goods are dry and bland. This is why 4 out of 5 is in order. However, everything else on the menu is spectacular. The moist and perfectly cooked meats go well with the fresh baked bread. If you are planning on taking on the slider challenge. My advise is to tackle the starch first. They are filling and the beef brisket you left behind will slide down real easy."}
{"text":"Chompi's is great. My sliders and soup were the best meal I had all day in Phoenix. Totally rocked. Meat was a bit bland so ask for spicy mustard. Bakery was excellent too. Love it."}
{"text":"I love eating here but tonight I'm very disappointed I came in for Friday night all you can eat fish and chips special I got sat down and asked what I would like to order told my waitress fish and chips she went to the kitchen and she came back and said they are all out hoping next time someone will communicate and say let the consumer know that they ran out of the special of the day."}
{"text":"Ive been coming to various Chompies locations for well over a decade.  It used to be THE deli (kind of the only option really) and was legitimately pretty good. At least the Shea location was.  Over time the quality seems to have gotten to a mediocre level while the prices have steadily increased.  A full corned beef sandwich is now $17.  I'm sorry but that's a tad ridiculous.  It was $12 not all that long ago which was teetering the line even then.  This isn't even close to a New York tasting/quality corned beef either even though its priced that way.  Big bummer Chompies, you once were glorious."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're looking for smaller portions, they don't work with you in selections. Our server (Nathan) was horrible- very sarcastic and eventually just totally ignored us! He's not customer service oriented. Manager didn't do much but offer stale bagels."}
{"text":"My husband & I are visiting my grandparents in Arizona & they rave about this deli so we went. After seeing their menu here on yelp i was very excited (have you seen the size of those pancakes??!) and so was my husband because he's gluten-free. 

So i got the dippin sandwich. I'm torn between $16 for a sandwich???? and $16 for a sandwich plus fries piled high with excellent quality brisket. Tough call. But admittedly the meat WAS dry; it's good it came with au jus because it would've been too dry alone. My grandpa liked the pierogis (he's had better he said, not enough cheese i think) but my grandma RAVED over the tender sauce smothered cabbage rolls. 

My husband got the pastrami on a gf roll and he LOVED it!! He also tried the liver & onions for the first time and he said it was very good too. 

Our waiter was funny, polite, didnt get anything wrong and knew who ordered what. Refills were on time & correct. I would come back! Too bad they arent everywhere.

Plus check in on yelp FREE COOKIE!"}
{"text":"There are a handful of places just minutes from Mill Ave that I think of when it's time for breakfast when I don't want to drive too far - Chompie's never disappoints! 

On rare occasions, there won't be a wait - so don't show up starving in case there is one. Love the bagels here (OBVIOUSLY) even though I just like plain with cream cheese. Great with a cup of regular coffee and omelet. I ordered hash for the first time last week. Served with lots-o-meat, but wasn't the best I've had - so I'll stick with omelets from now on.

P.S. Chompie's has these ridiculously good cookies you can eat (or bring home) while waiting called Rugelach - OMG - where have they been all my life? The apple or light colored ones are the best! Now I hope there is a line every time I go just as an excuse to eat these before breakfast."}
{"text":"Been here one time. May 17, 2010 about 5:30pm. The place was not very busy. It was clean, appeared to be well staffed. Servings were on the large size. I had their hot pastrami sandwich and fries. Both were very good. My cousin had a baked chicken and deep fried onions pieces. He said both were very good. The service was excellent. We got served in about 16 minutes from order to plates. Drinks were filled without asking. We left an above average tip, I will most likely return. We had dinner for two and left after paying about $39 after tip and tax.

Easy access off Tatum inside Paradise Valley Mall on the east side."}
{"text":"I have tried Chompie's 3 times that will probably be all for me.  today it was a half turkey sandwich, soup and slaw.

The slaw of ok but tiny.  The chicken noodle was way to heavy on celery and light on carrots and onion.  

The turkey sandwich was a giant pile of turkey on thin torn bread, there was no balance and no spread.  The turkey itself was cooked and sliced decently but it was under seasoned.  

I don't get the love for this place."}
{"text":"The omelettes we ordered were very good and quite large. Their bakery items come in a massive variety and are given away as samples at various locations around the storefront. Impossible to leave without feeling full and satisfied. Sandwiches look amazing too. Service was really good, though kitchen was slower than we expected."}
{"text":"My fellow diner did not care for the Pastrami sliders. Not sure why they grilled the meat before putting it on the slider, but it came out kind of looking like a burnt meat party. I had way more luck with the $11.99 new slider platter. It had my favorite, the brisket sliders (potato pancake style, gravy) and also came with a large cup of matzoh ball soup, and some slaw. Two of these sliders should fill up most people. Don't forget that free Black N White cookie with your Yelp check-in either. The cookies are dry and will melt in the heat, so yeah have some liquid on hand before taking a bite."}
{"text":"We were driving by Chompies on are way back home and there was a spot right up front. We thought divine intervention, we must stop and get a bagel for the drive. I ordered a sesame bagel lightly toasted with cream cheese. What a disappointment. My bagel was burnt and the whole bagel tasted like that. 
Very disappointed. Management should call a meeting and give a bagel 101 class on how to toast a bagel properly."}
{"text":"Very good \"almost\" NYC deli, food is great, I always order for carry out and the only thing I'd say is double check your order before leaving, they've forgotten a few things occasionally, but hey... it's a busy joint and poop happens! The Reuben's are awesome, pastrami and corned beef are tender and perfectly seasoned, the Jewish sliders (brisket, latke and cheese on a challah roll) are my hubby's fav and I know why, ...Delish! The chicken kreplach soup is the BEST if you're feeling under the weather or if you feel terrific, either way! Their baked goods are kinda perfect...they remind me of home, the ruegalah (sort of like a strudel) and rainbow cookies are to die for!"}
{"text":"Some friends recommended this place after coming to a celebration here recently. The inside is nothing special. Old tables and chairs spaced out in an awkward fashion. 
Upon arriving you walk into the bakery!!! So the bakery treats look delectable- I had a sample of a delicious Danish. 
For my dinner I chose blueberry pancakes which I wasn't impressed by.  A scarce amount of berries in the center only of a huge pancake that filled the plate. The portion was generous but I make better pancakes at home! Plus I *thought* there would be blueberry syrup but nope it's regular maple syrup so that was disappointing too. It's kinda expensive in my opinion too. My 2 stack of pancakes were $12. Kids meals were \"ok\", again great portions but lacking in taste. 
My friend had sliders which honestly looked amazing- especially the western version. If I ever return I'll have that but doubt I'll give it a second try."}
{"text":"I KNOW They have fairly good New York \"STYLE brisket\" though nothing like ANY real NY Deli.That being said they could use a major overhaul in their TO GO Customer service or NON SERVICE! Walked out after ordering and waiting half an hour for sliced brisket to go, no meal, not even heated up. I watched while the ONE take out girl waited on everyone else and got their orders while mine sat on the counter. I spoke to a manager to expedite things and after he said he'd be with me , walked out after another 10 minutes of more waiting! THE OWNERS SHOULD BE FURIOUS!"}
{"text":"So many great choices in one place. Not to mention, it's a little bit of New York in the desert. I highly recommend the pastrami and corned beef sandwich as well as their bagels and lox."}
{"text":"I came here to try the Jewish sliders that were on the Man vs. Food challenge, not the challenge.  There was also a western slider that sounded good.  The waitress starts out by asking for our drinks and gives us a dish pickles... NICE!!  The entree came with three sliders.  The waitress was able to substitute one Jewish slider for a western slider, which was cool.  

The plate came out and every square inch was covered.  The brisket from the slider was cooked well.  The roll for the slider was really filling.  I'm glad there was a side of gravy that came with the order.  Great dipping sauce.  The western slider with briskets, onion strings, cheddar, and bbq sauce tasted better than the Jewish slider with brisket potato cake and swiss cheese.  Instead of fries, I got the onion strings.  Rings would've been better than strings.  

I brought some desserts home.  They were good, but not WOW good.  

If I come back, I'll probably better off with a regular sandwich."}
{"text":"This is one of the best NY style deli's I have been to! The sandwiches are ginormous and delicious. They definitely don't skimp on the meat! I would recommend this place even to the pickiest New Yorkers. They also have a breakfast that is bomb dot com!"}
{"text":"Bakery items look nice but taste terrible! I took home 2 mini chocolate mousse cake slices and 2 lemon bars. Dry and awful! They all were close to being stale and hard. My guests for dinner were disappointed  as was I. I picked these all up Monday afternoon which I presumed would be fresh....wrong!"}
{"text":"Macie rocks!! Great service tonight. Good food. Sometimes its slammed but still will be back"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time today.  I was left angry and confused.  I was rudely treated by the host guy.  An older gentlemen who looked very confused when I entered and asked him a simple question.  \"Can I order to go please?\"  He replied with a very loud and rude \"huh!?!\"  I was born and raised in San Diego, CA it was as if he didn't want to understand me because I wasn't a typical Scottsdale looking male.  I wanted to ask him, \"Do you understand english?\"  I was so taken back.  Usually when you run into a host at a restaurant, they greet you with a \"Good Morning how many?\"  I ordered a #5 corned beef egg and cheese bagel breakfast sandwhich.  It was avg at best.  I tried to ask about the yelp check in and the worker was just confused.  I'm really tempted to give it 1 star but I'll be nice today."}
{"text":"I got the Arizona Benedict with a gluten free bagel and the flavors all together were like a party in my mouth. I was also shocked they didn't charge extra for the gluten free option and it wasn't a lot smaller like at most places. Jason and Pete checked on me several times which my my experience even more delightful with all the coffee refills."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through doordash.   No gravy on my grannies breakfast skillet. Salad was wilted, breadsticks so stale i could have used em as spears.  Very disappointed, esp considering the cost"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars. My husband loved the pastrami sand. and my french toast was good. A little pricey but overall good food with a NY vibe."}
{"text":"This place was my first visit to a Jewish deli, it did not disappoint! The Jewish sliders were incredible! The brisket was perfectly cooked and the cheese was melted just right.  The potato was crispy and had an interesting texture, and plenty of food was served for the price. Perfectly seasoned wedge style fries."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a Saturday morning with my husband and 14 month old son. The restaurant is large and clean. We were seated right away and the host brought us a highchair right away as well. (You'd be surprised at how often that gets neglected when we go out so I appreciate it!) He also asked if our son would like crayons and brought a kids menu for him to color. Thanks again!

The breakfast menu is EXTENSIVE! I ordered the Breakfast of Champions: 2 pancakes, eggs, and turkey sausage. We ordered the kid's french toast for my son and my husband ordered the Chompie's Breakfast Sliders. We were all happy with our food. My husband's breakfast sliders were huge and looked delish! My only complaint was that the middle of my pancakes were still doughy, but other than that the food was good. The server was very attentive and pleasant and everything was reasonably priced. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So, the family has been here many times. Lately the smoked white fish is good. In the recent past it was dry and old. Be Very careful of the bakery. My sister got food poisoning from a pastry there. On the good side, the smoked fish is now much improved. Potato salad is my favorite--and I am from Manhattan. Half sour pickles are great too. I do like this place, but at times be careful."}
{"text":"We have been here so many times but I have yet to find a favorite dish. Don't get me wrong, I have never gotten anything that wasn't good, but it wasn't OMG great either. My boyfriend loves the pastrami or the turkey sandwiches & the chicken soup.  If the kids are with us we normally let them pick out a treat from the bakery. Chompies is a good place to go if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Waited for 15 minutes without even the offer or water or even an acknowledgement of our existence.  Manager was seated at a table stuffing the fork bags, oblivious to anything resembling customer service.  Eaten here before and the food is OK, but they could care less about their customers.  Avoid unless you have a lot of time to spend there..."}
{"text":"I had a less than mediocre experience at the location on Shea Blvd. in Scottsdale. I posted my review on Yelp, and the marketing director actually contacted me, so we tried the Paradise Valley (Mall) location, and what a difference! My Wife actually timed our server, and within 5 minutes, our order was delivered with a smile! I had the brisket, and she had the Jewish sliders. Absolutely delicious! Excellent service, fantastic food, and great experience overall... That, and on one of their busiest days I imagine; Father's Day. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The best corned beef hash I've ever had in my life. Service was amazing, very attentive and he even offered us 2 large coffees to go. This is my new breakfast place when I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is the original location and not the biggest location. They also do not have a very impressive bakery in Tempe either for some reason. Anyway, was here for lunch and discovered two new slider combinations with soup and cole slaw on the menu. One person loved the turkey, cranberry, havarti, potato pancake version, while I was swooning over the original version as usual. You get choice of a cup of any soup, small slaw and free pickles and two monster sliders for about 12 bucks. Went back to my roots and also ordered an Egg Cream,, but while not the best (no foam) it still satisfied my youthful craving. Nice staff as well, explaining all about the slider challenge. We finished ours, but Adam Richman could not down his 12 sliders."}
{"text":"By far, the best Bagels west of NY City! Many flavors bagels are usually still warm from the oven no matter what time of day I go there. Bakery goods and Deli area items are top quality too with a huge selection. Pasteries & desserts are amazingly delicious. A+++++"}
{"text":"Great bagels and huge portions try the knish and the cookies are so authentic"}
{"text":"Got here about 2:30 and got seated right away. They brought a bowl of pickles over and I have to say after three refills, it still wasn't enough (loved them)!
They food took about 15 min and when it came there was a lot of it. My wife got the Monte Cristo and she really enjoyed it. The strawberry jam had whole mini strawberries in it, good stuff.
I ordered the Jewish sliders and these were really good. The meat was tender and delicious, the potato pancake was perfect and the hola bread was very flavorful. I should have ordered the coleslaw because with the fries it was way to much starch (next time).
Our server Beth was very attentive and we will be back, do that the menu has a million things to choose from."}
{"text":"While the service here is hit or miss, (mostly miss to be brutally honest) the food is consistently good and the portions generous, to say the least.  Before we moved away, whenever we were in the mood for NY style deli food, this was our go-to place.  When the parents were in town, this happened almost weekly.  It was the one place we could all agree upon.  And if the service was bad, the food more than made up for it. Plus, the bad service gave us all something to complain about, while eating obscene amounts of delicious deli food.  So, really, this was a win-win. ;)  

Some of my favorites include the Matzah ball soup (if you're ever sick, this stuff is truly medicinal), cheese and berry blintzes (like cheating and getting dessert for dinner, yay!), stuffed cabbage rolls (love the sweet and tangy sauce), and the potato latkes... not to mention the incredible, ginormous sandwiches.  Chompie's meats and their breads are excellent.  They have their own bakery, where they bake their famous bagels and more, way more... cakes, cup cakes, black and whites, cannolis, rainbow cookies, rugelach, etc, etc.  Their extensive bakery is seriously one of the best in the valley and we rarely ever came to Chompie's without getting dessert (and some sweet goodies to take home.)"}
{"text":"Never got to try the food because the service is ridiculously bad. 
Walked in on a Friday night around 7:30. We were greeted and promptly seated. We then waited and waited and waited. I'd say somewhere around 10 different staff members passed by and no one stopped. After 20 minutes a waitress finally stopped by to tell us that she was off and she would see why no one wanted to serve us. After another 10 minutes we got up and left. 
On the way out the door I stopped back at the hostess and asked why there were 10+ people working and yet no one cared about helping us. She replied \"uh, (pause) sorry. Where were you seated?\"  I was seated right where you sat me! 
How is there no manager around supervising ?
Anyway, don't waste your time. There are too many other places in the area to eat."}
{"text":"Well we're in a Jewish deli so it's pastrami on rye and we weren't disappointed . I'm not a pastry person but they did looked delicious. The food would get 5 stars but the set up in the mall took away from the experience as it's really loud."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! We had the most amazing sandwiches and the service was exceptional. Brian, one of the owners, found out it was our first time and made us feel completely at home. He stopped by our table to make sure we were happy. Couldn't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Chompies has the best bagels in AZ. Period.

Most places under cook their bagels, and they are too doughy- like Einstein's. 

Chompies bagels are unmatched and very tasty, along with their cream cheese, which comes in a ton of different flavor options."}
{"text":"I am really very forlorn at having to give Chompie's a 2 star-er. This place has been my go to weekend breakfast spot for years. Hello, day drinking begining at 7am on game days?? You know me...sign me up. I am eternally in love with the home fries, and have been known to stop by just for a side of them \"to go\" 

But I went last Thursday with my 7 year old niece Isabella who was home sick from school (whole other story starting at about 5am which started with my sister calling...\"Please Nesto watch her for me or I'll lose my job\") As a bachelor who eats out a lot, not a ton in the fridge for a kid....so....breakfast? Get in the car.

Seated right away, as always. That's where the service stalled. Birds chirping as my niece looks at me with big sick-y eyes. No water, no server, busser or hostess to flag down. 

Finally blondie comes up and looks a bit irritated to se us. \"Do you know what you want ('yet'? seems to be the unspoken word she wants to throw out to finish the question) as if we have been wasting her time in the 10  minutes we haven't seen her. Yes we do. Pancake and OJ for Bell, Coffee two eggs over med, home fries and dry rye for me. 

She turns, grabs a tray of complimentary pickles off a side bar and slides them onto the table. The bright green are great. Garlicky and crisp. 

5 min, she brings the drinks. kids cup for Bell. No straw. I don't notice it immediately but blondie is right across the isle helping a guy in a tie so when she turns I get her attention. Again she seems pissed that I asked for a straw and drops 4 on the table. WTH?
 15 more minutes for food. I am a little interested and not pleased with the fact that the butter and syrup are in disposable pre-packaged containers. Has this always been the case? I am not a pancake eater, so I don't really know, but the place is a BAKERY. Surely they can dole out some butter and have syrup on hand. That was kinda weird. 

I was so distracted by that, that I realized after blondie left. NO friggin silverware. OK, now I am starting to get miffed. Flag her down again.

Potatoes, cold. Final straw. The rye was delish. Love that stuff chewy and flavorful. But largely, we left two almost untouched plates as we left the place. 

Maybe it was just a bad day for blondie. But that was not a great experience at one of my favorite places. I even forgot to buy a loaf of rye dammit."}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is fast and efficient which can leave you a little put off. I like it though, I'm there to get my food not chat for ever. Love the Morning Riser."}
{"text":"Saw this featured on Man vs. Food, but didn't like the idea of cruising all the way to Tempe. I noticed they have put one up at the Arrowhead Mall and decided to take a friend and my children for breakfast last Sunday. I ordered the Original Jewish Sliders mentally prepping myself to potentially come back and take on the slider challenge. What a flavor disappointment. Don't get me wrong-everything from the bread, potato pancake, to the brisket were top notch-they just lacked any flavor. Bland is an overstatement. For 13.99 I was hoping for much more and it came with delicious but a small handful of french fries. These potatoes (French fries) were the highlight of everyone's meal! My sons ordered a chicken fingers-ok too hot and a burger- tasteless was how it was described, and my friend had a bagel that was meh. For a 50 dollar breakfast it really wasn't worth it.  Would I go back? Possibly. I want to try a Ruben and many menu items look appetizing, but I will certainly plan on bland."}
{"text":"Best meatloaf sandwich on the planet! Actually been here many many times and it's always very good. Huge portions be it breakfast, lunch or dinner. Good bakery, very good cookies and bagels. Sometimes the wait can be long, so we go more often when ASU is on break, much easier to g"}
{"text":"Pages of options on the menu, can be a little overwhelming. All the Benedict plates are really good. Fresh bagels, every flavor you can think of. Come, eat, be full. Service is always friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Worst food ever on the night of Chanukah. We could have had better food at the worst fast food place. Roast chicken was a joke. Stuffed cabbage looked like a pile of garbage. Meat knish? A giant puff shell stuffed with an ungodly amount of dried out meat. Seriously,who would eat garbage like this?"}
{"text":"We go here most every Friday morning.  Sometimes packed with college kids, but they behave themselves for the most part.

Breakfast weekday special is eggs with potatoes and a bagel.  It's a winner at a great price.  

Wait staff is attentive and keeps the coffee hot and the soda cold.  

Free pickle platter too!"}
{"text":"I had been going here for about 7 years now, and only now have decided to review the place. I have 2 reasons for the 2-star review: Price, and service. Wife and I had breakfast, and the bill came to about 38 bucks. C'Mon Man! Really? For what? Wasn't like it was steak and eggs, anything mega-fancy, etc. And, we asked for re-fills on the ice teas, and actually had to get up, go to the drink station ourselves and grab our own re-fills after waiting ten minutes. Then, after breakfast, my Wife wanted to get a few bakery items, and it was like pulling teeth to try and get someone to help us... When they weren't even that busy. Bottom line is that I don't mind spending money when you get what you pay for, but overpriced, mediocre food, combined with BAD service, makes me think I shall not be returning here any time in the near future."}

{"text":"Don't ever try ordering breakfast for dinner at chompies. Not only was my order wrong but 2 other tables got the wrong food.  The will be severely delayed.  When i eventually did get my food it was cold and under cooked.  So disappointed. Two thumbs down for the evening hours service and food.   However, two thumbs up for morning meals and service."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Chopie's a hundred times...and it's one of my all time favorites....until tonight.  I ordered the Jewish chicken and dumplings (strips of chicken on sliced matzoballs covered in turkey gravy)...sounds delish....but not.   The gravy had at least half a cup of salt in it.  It was totally impossible to eat.  I returned it for a sandwich.  The pickles were tough and the steamed broccoli had stems you could not cut...let alone eat.  Worse meal I've ever had there.  The waitress was kind and helpful and I finally got to eat something digestible.   They need to drug test the cook."}
{"text":"Chompies has gone downhill. It's not the fault of the wait staff, it's management.
My wife and I have been coming here almost every week for 10 years now, but last night was our last visit. Once again, the wait staff was completely new. Gone are the old days when we knew the names of our servers and they knew us too (David, Jey, Amanda, Jessica, Zach). So last night, service was slow even though the place was only half full. Other customers were complaining and the servers were saying that they were using a new computer system to track the loyalty points and it was not working. I wasn't buying it because the slow service has become the trend. Again, the servers are doing the best they can. They're just new and overworked. As a result, when we did finally get our food, it was almost cold. Our server did apologize on the wait, even though we did not mention it. 
We will be searching for a new hangout. Chompies of Chandler has become a good candidate for next season's Kitchen Nightmares."}
{"text":"I love this place and the location doesn't do it justice. I've been coming here for 30 years and love the assortment of baked items as well as menu items."}
{"text":"This is my third time in here, and my third dish tried. I loved the pastrami (as noted before) and the turkey sliders I got last time. However, I got the Adele's Asian Salad today and I wouldn't really recommend it.  Not enough to knock off a star, but here is my take... 

It is enormous as all their food is, and served with two huge parmesan breadsticks. I thought the chicken was extremely protein-y (stick with me here, like when meat is over cooked or reheated).  Mine didn't come with the crispy noodles it was supposed to and I thought the asian dressing was very thick, heavy and not very delicious. 

If you plan to take half home, be sure to order the chicken on the side since it's covered in a sauce and the salad won't keep. A better option would be to order no chicken. :) 

I'll still be back, but I wouldn't order that again."}
{"text":"Picked up Thanksgiving dinner for take out. Delicious! Juicy turkey and flavorful sides. I think a lot of other folks had the same idea to pick up take out rather than cook a whole Thanksgiving meal. I loved that you didn't necessarily have to call days ahead to reserve meals. A lot of the people in line had called ahead and payed over the phone. I just walked in and ordered from a very nice lady and she quickly put together my meals. She even threw in a couple extra slices of pie. The wait was fairly quick (maybe 5-7 minutes) to place your order, and the register/ deli area were a bit cramped, but it was honestly not a bothersome wait. My meals were very tasty and a great value. The BF and I will be back soon, as there is quite the menu selection! I am not religious, but I may even have to pick up a Hanukkah house for the holidays (think of a beautiful blue themed gingerbread house)! It was very hard to resist a bagel or one of the many pastries staring me down from the case while I waited to pay for my meal."}
{"text":"We've been going to Chompies for a very long time, and I can honestly say we have seen our last visit.  

If you haven't been in a while, be prepared for a huge menu change, and the choices that once existed are gone.  It seems like 50% of the menu is gone, and all my old favorites are certainly gone.  

I can't really say whats going on, but our last two visits I can say started out fair, then slipped directly in to unacceptable.  I can say i never thought it was great, but I always thought Chompies did mediocre perfectly.   

So I'll lay it out like this.  

Burger, ordered medium, came out raw.  I'm not saying undercooked, I am saying the ground meat was RAW.  the cheese was melted, so I know someone put it on the grill to cook it.   Now talk about uncomfortable, we showed our server, who brought the manager (which we didn't ask for I assure you) who brought out a line cook...  What are you thinking, show him this health hazard somewhere else.  I did jokingly say I felt somewhat lucky we had Scottsdale Healthcare right next door after this one.
In the same meal, we had two deli sandwiches.  All I can say was the meat was rubbery and wet.  Yes, wet.  To me it was almost like it came out of the freezer or something, sliced and put on the sandwich.  YUCK.  

Now about the service which on my latest visit was ridiculously bad.  The waiter forgot items, didn't return to the table, and all, given the restaurant had 10 customers all together was horrendous.  (BTW, it wasn't our waiter who brought over the manager it was someone else, he was nowhere to be found)
  
Now my other recent visit, the service was stellar (at the PV Mall restaurant).  Our server was more than on, he was outstanding.  In fact, for that visit, the service was a solid 5/5... food was 1.5/5 on that one.

Anyway, for us, we have seen our last visits to Chompies.  I should throw in our out of town Guests, stopped going back last year except for one hold out, who has finally said its over as well....   Everything changes, and if you can't even do mediocre, then there isn't much left..."}
{"text":"Chompies has been around forever, and with good reason. Very good comfort food and the bagels are the best you will find in our fair state. 

As you might imagine- the bagels are the star here. I love the sesame and garlic bagels- super good! Don't forget to try their delicious cream cheese!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic deli, which is a surprise to find in Arizona.  I instantly felt transported back to NYC when I walked in, accept for the fact that the average age of the dinner was over 50!  That said, the food was great and the pastrami and matzo ball soup was some of the best I've had.  

I recommend the half sandwich and soup, unless you have a HUGHE appetite and can eat half a side of beef!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We went for an early Sunday lunch, around 11 am. The food was excellent, delicious pastrami and very tasty matzoh ball soup. Only complaint was the service, we had to continuously ask for more coffee and water."}

{"text":"I am a \"Yelper\" bad and good and this one is good.  We went to breakfast last Sunday with a group of 7 of us. This time we were lucky enough to get a gal named \"Mo\". She was funny and attentive. (Not like that Donald server guy that is the complete opposite..OMG ! :-(   ).  Anyway... she made sure the 7 of us had enough coffee, water, our food came out perfect and she was there if anyone needed anything. I called the manager over and told her how wonderful Mo was to us and that we'd be back. Thanks to Mo for making our breakfast a fun and delicious one :-) !"}
{"text":"I should know by now that restaurants featured on Man Vs. Food do not necessarily have the best food, but the most food. Chompie's feels like a chain restaurant with a great bakery at the front. I had the Jewish Sliders. The challah rolls were delicious, the mini potato pancakes were very good, and I liked the gravy (especially with the fries). However, the brisket was bland and lukewarm. I did not buy anything from the bakery, but I wish I had because the bread was the best part of my meal."}
{"text":"I had been a long time fan of Chompies, going to their Phoenix locations for over 20 years. I have always been a particular fan of their pastrami sandwiches. However, the last couple times I have gone, I have been less than impressed with their service. Today was the epitome. I visited there Shae location and waited over 15 minutes and no one brought me a water, took my order for a drink, or even acknowledged my presence. The waitress even served the table right next to me and walked away. Perhaps they were too busy? No, there were  probably only four other occupy tables besides me. When I got up to leave, I explained to the hostess how nobody waited my table. She sweetly apologized, and wished me a good day.

I am saddened to see one of my favorite establishments fall due to poor management."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite bagel place anywhere! They've got a dozen or more different flavored bagels, my favorite is the spinach everything bagel with their veggie and southwestern cream cheese.  The cream cheeses are ridiculously good. So full of flavor! They run a $4.99 special with pancakes and eggs, worth every penny! 
We have never had an issue here, whether it be eating in at the cafe or getting a bite to go. The staff is very friendly and helpful and willing to give a recommendation if needed. The decor is retro New York and adorable."}
{"text":"My amazing experience started before I even walked in. I had the door opened for me, was asked if I was here for take-out, shown a menu and offered a few items that the man liked himself. The young girl at the checkout counter complimented my hair, was extremely nice and paid for my drink for me. 
Now the food. I had the Ruby Reuben and OMG. It was fantastic! I'm from back east and miss authentic Jewish food. This is authentic. It was so juicy and creamy and sour and I LOVED it.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"They have wonderful food here, I have been eating at chompies for 15 years. They also have pastries that are yummy and sugar free for diabetics."}
{"text":"Ice cold mac and cheese, a Ruben with no 1000 island dressing or sourkraut they took them back, then reserved the same food.  Yeah you're not allowed to do that under health regulations.  No manager notification and didn't offer to take something of the bill."}
{"text":"I have been wanted to go to Chompie's forever and now that I am leaving Phoenix, I felt like it was necessary to try it out.  I had to try the Jewish Sliders that I had seen on Man V Food.  Obviously, I didn't try the challenge because I don't want to ruin latkes, brisket or challah for me for the rest of my life.  My platter came with three of these gorgeous beauties.  Every element worked perfectly in the sandwich.  You definitely have to dip the slider in the gravy though.  It can taste a little dry without it.  The fries were nice and crispy too.

It is sad that I won't get to try their bagels and other menu items because this menu looked extensive and banging."}
{"text":"I've been going to Chompies for years and years... I miss the location at 32nd St/Greenway, however, the parking at PV mall is soooo much better!!!!  

I've NEVER had a bad meal here... for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.    The portion sizes are INCREDIBLE!!    Everything you could want for a Jewish/New York style deli/diner food.  

Plan on only eating half your plate and then dive into their fabulous dessert selection-- YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!"}
{"text":"Great tasting bagels that Einstein's  can't possibly compare to, a wide selection of cream cheese flavors and lox to spare, and a sweets case that I can't tear my eyes from."}
{"text":"So far; tje best bagel I've eaten in Arizona:) As a Jersey girl, it's hard to find decent pizza and bagels so close to that home taste... But Chompies brings it! The cheese bagel is my favorite with thr chives cream cheese!!!! We normally take out but we did eat in once and I loveddd the bloody mary and service! Chicken soup lacked taste, so we'll stick to bagels... :)"}
{"text":"You wake up one morning and realize you have no breakfast food. In fact, you go look in your refrigerator and you realize all the cheese has become a science project and you have no cream for your coffee. Crap. You go sit down at the the table and ponder what your next step should be...do I go to the store and buy everything I need and try to assemble a half decent breakfast? By the time I get to the store, get back home, cook, eat, clean up, my morning is gone. That seems like too much effort on some days, doesn't it?

The answer?

Drive to Chompie's. 

*By the time you put your baseball hat one, brush your teeth, get dressed and open the garage door: 10:15 a.m.
*Go out to the driveway and pick up the weekend edition: 10:16 a.m.
*Have a conversation with your neighbor about the irritating HOA rules and regulations and all the neighbors that don't pay attention to the HOA: 10:24 a.m.
*Pull your car out of the garage and head to Chompies: 10:26 a.m.
*Drive to 92nd Street and Shea, park and enter the restaurant: 10:40 a.m.
*Wait for a table: 10:50
*Your order a beverage while you browse the menu: 10:55
*You realize its almost 11 a.m., which means that you can have breakfast or lunch and be within very good boundaries on either option. Should you have a 3\" High Reuben Sandwich on an onion roll, or Bagel and Lox? French Toast? Eggs, Bacon? Pancakes? 

The possibilities are endless, the service is efficient and you didn't have to go to the grocery store."}
{"text":"Went in for a pastrami Ruben. Left with a new favorite delicatessen. Honest to god the best Reuben I've ever had. What made it the perfect experience. A little worker named Haiely. She was a model employee. She helped me with every question I had, no matter how small. I can confidently say I have never been prouder to be Jewish than the moment I set foot in this establishment."}
{"text":"Ridiculous wait time. Chompies desperately needs some new management and oversight. After being seated you wait, and wait....and wait......and wait. Then the sub par food comes out. And you wait....and wait....and wait. You wait so long you regret ever stepping foot into this place. Anything would have been better than spending half your morning in this dump. Anything. The food is below average. The wait times are absolutely ridiculous and the food is slightly over priced. If this is what you look for when grabbing something to eat then Chompies is right up your alley. I will never come back here."}
{"text":"Everything you order here is sooo good! The clam chowder doesn't have the grainy / sandy bits in it (which I'm always looking out for in a good clam chowder) their perogies are great, and their Jewish Sliders are amazing (but loaded with calories, and pretty expensive, so it's a very rare order) -- basically everything you order here is really good.

The only bad thing I've seen be ordered is: a couple of friends ordered their ribs on their all you can eat night, and they didn't like them. The waitress said the ribs are a hit or miss kinda thing to order, that some nights it's a great batch, and some nights they aren't that good. But the manager came around and apparently other people were saying the ribs weren't good, so she asked them if they would like to order something else instead. So the service has always been friendly as well."}
{"text":"Good food for the #1 Jewish gamer in the world Tarfu to eat at"}
{"text":"I love their cake, and there is lots of it.

Alone on a Friday night. *sigh*
Tonight I walked in at 8:59 pm (they close at 9:00pm. Yes, I'm that guy) and they still sat me. I ordered some soup and shortly after could hear some people in the kitchen hustling to make it for me because they had already started cleaning things up. I could tell they were shutting down and I felt a little bad.

Then my waitress, named Kara, was the bomb. She was extremely friendly. She didn't rush me at all. She even said, \"Don't rush, we still have work to do.\" Her genuine cheerfulness made me feel better about coming in so late. She also offered me water as I left.

I gave her a good tip, but after I left I realize I added it up incorrectly. I checked the transaction online just now and they didn't put my tip on it at all. Maybe this is because she felt bad that I initially felt a bit rushed? Or maybe this is a policy that if the customer (me) adds it up incorrectly they just take it off completely? I'm going with the former.

The food is always good and my soup was very yummy, as was my cake.

Kara rocks. She made my evening."}
{"text":"Wow, I've got to say that this place and food is different than any place I've ever been to. The menu is HUGE, I was going through it like, it's not gonna end? All of this is in size 10 font, it's like a novel!! There's so much to choose from! As I scan over the menu, I see everything from breakfast,  sandwiches, burgers, traditional dinners, and on and on....

We eventually chose the oh so delicious Greek Chomp-a-dilla (Sauteed spinach, minced garlic, greek feta cheese, diced tomato, onions, scallions & a hint of Parmesan cheese) for an appetizer. Very fresh and the combo of flavors go well together. 

I had the Chicken in the Pot, holy mother... when they brought it out, it was so big that I actually sputtered, \"How am I supposed to... eat it?\" Another table had noticed just how giant my entree was and had to ask what in the world I ordered. This bowl of soup had 2 halves chickens, (not diced, not cubed, a chicken cut in half!), celery, carrots, jumbo matzo balls, kreplach, and noodles. They gave me a friggn' ladle for cryn' out loud. 

Plus they had so many delicious looking pastries just begging us from the desert case, we just had to get cheesecake to go.

Can't wait back to try the endless menu!"}
{"text":"While on a mini staycation last month we stopped by the Chandler location to pick up some desserts for our family. We got 2 sprinkle sugar cookies, a peanut butter cookie, lemon bar, chocolate eclair, slice of German chocolate cake, and a black and white cookie. We were excited to try all our goodies. The black and white and peanut butter cookies were the only winners in our opinions. Everything else fell just a little short sadly, the textures were there but each dessert was lacking in something to complete the flavor. We will give Chompie's another try and let y'all know what we found."}
{"text":"If I could give chompies no star I would their food looks delicious but looks can be deceiving it tastes like cardboard there is no flavor they're matzo ball soup is Campbell's chicken noodle soup in a can they suck I'll Never Eat Here Again and I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy the food is all out bad and their service is bad the guy that helps us was very rude"}
{"text":"Chompie's I love your restaurant but really poor customer service today.  I came in to order the Jewish Sliders for .99 cents.  I understand the rules of dine in prices only and no take out orders.  But \"no to go box\" if I don't finish my order of minimum of 2 and I can't take home my leftovers?  

I am in the restaurant industry myself and I understand the people out there that can abuse special deals.  But to tell me that I have to pay for my food and not be able to take home what I don't finish is ridiculous.  Plus the snotty waitress that offered to give me napkins then say \"I don't make the rules\" with smirk on her face didn't help the situation.  You should have instructed your staff to just say yes instead of risking losing customers.

I got up and left."}
{"text":"This was my first time in a Chompie's and first impressions are lasting impressions for me. Let me break this down for you...

We entered the restaurant and it was very busy but we didn't have to wait long to be seated and we did get a nice booth. The menu is vast that's the only way I could put it for my first time there I was just overwhelmed by the choice's they offered. I ended up getting the Cajun Chicken, my grandmother had a Meatloaf sandwich both came with potato fries. My Cajun Chicken which was supposed to be HOT was delicious but it was less than mild. My grandmother said her meatloaf wasn't very flavor full, I didn't try it but I would take her word for it. The restaurant was very loud and my grandmother is 80 years old so it was difficult for her to converse with me. 

The portions are huge neither of us were able to finish our plates, I personally don't care for giant portions. You will be assaulted with food at every turn in this place which makes sensible choices difficult. Chompies, honestly, it reminded me of an upscale Denny's. Better food, but atmosphere was exactly the same... If you've ever been in a typical Denny's you'll know exactly what that comparison means. Our server wasn't the best, we felt neglected at times and she was very pushy for us to hurry and place our order. 

Overall, my first impression of Chompies was not a good one and I'm still on the fence about weather or not I would return."}
{"text":"Found this place by chance while waiting for my truck to get an alignment across the street. fabulous! Great food great service great prices! The weekday specials are awesome, good portions. Got eggs, potatoes and yummy bagel for the price they charge for the bagel alone at other places. Only wish it was closer to home but definitely will be a return customer."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. Food is mediocre and service is horrible. Why do they keep the mean old man behind the counter? He must either own the place or is related to someone that owns it because I can't imagine why someone would keep him employed. Lol. He's really rude-amazingly rude. Enough to drive me away."}
{"text":"Clearly phone orders are not a priority. I just sat on hold for 10 minutes waiting for someone to take my phone order. I am under a time crunch and simply wanted to place a sandwich order and go pick it up before a meeting. I finally gave up after sitting on hold for 10 minutes. Do not recommend them if you just want to place a phone order."}
{"text":"Great service and the best potato pancakes. Love this place.  Come here every chance I get."}
{"text":"I would like to write an update on my original review.  I was actually contacted by someone in customer service yesterday on my initial experience at this location.  They stated they were concerned on how my experience was and they were going to turn it over to the proper management team.  That in my eyes truly does deserve another visit and another star on top of that.  It's nice to see a company reading these reviews and taking action."}
{"text":"We usually go to the Chandler location, but we were in the neighborhood so we stopped in.  I ordered pecan waffles w/eggs and turkey sausage.  The Chandler location puts whipped cream and carmelized pecans on it; it didnt have it here and my sausage was like a hockey puck.  Other orders - Happy Mouse pancakes with bacon and Nova Lox. The kids' pancakes didn't have whipped cream and their bacon was extremely overcooked - basically burnt.  We had to ask to have the bacon re-made.  The lox did not come with capers, as it is at the Chandler location; we had to ask for that too.  At the end of the meal,  the Chandler location also gives the kids a cookie - not given at this location.  We ended up buying it as we left.  Chandler location is above and beyond in presentation and service.  Maybe we're spoiled at the Chandler location, but  it's a much better bang for the buck."}

{"text":"In the battle of Man vs. Food, this man won.

What can you say about Chompie's? They make some pretty good sliders and some great bagels. I would definitely stick to sliders when coming here because when we came for their Spring Training BOGO hot dog special, we were disappointed. It's not the most exciting chili dog and their Sonora dog was a joke. Then again, you are asking for a Sonoran style hot dog at the Jewish deli so what was the wife really expecting, right? Haha! They both tasted alright but we were expecting more since we love their other offerings. 

For such a slow Saturday, service was okay at best. I think I'll stick to their Chandler location. 

Also, don't forget your Yelp check-in offer for a free Black & White Cookie."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great breakfasts, lunches and dinners. 
Their pastrami is the best in the state, and their turkey that is used in sandwiches tastes real (as in NOT the watery deli stuff you find in most places). They did get rid of my favorite \"sandwich\",  the El Paso Wrap, but I've found they'll still make it for me when I get a craving for it. The chicken soups are delish and home made (and wonderful when you are sick with the flu or a cold). 
Needless to say, their bagels are killer. 
Frequently a line, but worth the wait, if you have the time. 
Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Just in for a simple breakfast but it was o so good. Wife's scrambled eggs soft like she likes them. Michael our server very friendly and informative as wife doesn't like bagels he explained the bagel versus bills to her.

{"text":"They can't all be winners...

I came excited when I heard about New York inspired foods with a Jewish flare talked about on yelp. I was ready to enjoy knish, matzo balls and the famous Jewish sliders. Then I got lost in a menu straight from the labyrinth and things went south.

The potato knish was a sad sight. Overly cooked on the corners and it blurred into a mound of oil and disenchantment when cut into. Was I in the right place??

The matzo balls came next I know now they are supposedly made of fried matzo meal with eggs and oil, it made me think it was a fancy version of fry bread. However the texture was too odd for me. Having ranch as a side made these passable but utterly forgettable. Are they supposed to be really really greasy??

My Jewish and Western sliders where nothing to write home about. Although I will write to inform you good people that the bread was the best part. From there on the low quality meat really takes center stage as overly oiled fries with an odd skin( likely frozen) bitters a sweet idea with uninspired compromise. The onion ring batter was bland and the onions were so small I almost missed them.

The food missed the mark. The press this place got was undeserved today but even if it wasn't there were a few other things that would keep me away. But I will only talk about the one.

The Menu!!! What the hell? I need a subway map to navigate the damn thing, well over 80 menu options on board. Breakfast served all day. That's nice except I can't make up my damn mind without pulling out my reading glasses for this epoch of a menu. The items where strewn about with no coherent arrangement beside the common starter/entree array which is still convoluted. 

I walked out broke and disgusted with myself , like Vegas but less fun. I would say the greasy and flour loaded meals sound like a good cheat meal, but the only person who gets hurt is you...

Eeck :("}
{"text":"Pretty solid corned beef sandwich here with wedge fries. Went for the Jumbo half sandwich for $10.99 and upgraded for free to those good crisp fries. They serve free pickles and the sandwich should be more than enough for one normal person. The corned beef was pretty lean and of course, you must get rye bread and for me thousand Island on the side. The booths are a bit cramped and this looks like an older location of the chain, but the good food quality remains the same. Oh, no old Jewish waitresses at this location either."}
{"text":"With an exception for the bagel and egg morning special the food is overpriced and I've had better. A small sandwhich for $13 or $14 with a 1/8 cup of bad potatoe salad just isn't my idea of a fair or pleasant lunch (Aaron's Fav), 

The staff openly complaining about one another is always a turn off to me no matter where it happens and it has happened here more times than I care to record.

 By far their best asset in staffing is the waitress Donna. She quickly remembers you and how you take your coffee and tries effortlessly it seems to make your visit an enjoyable one."}
{"text":"I have now stopped into this Chompie's now twice.  I historically have gone to Einstein's for bagels, and while I enjoy them everyone I have spoken to has sworn by this place.  They were right.  I really loved the cheddar bagel here.  It was incredibly fresh and not overally toasted.  I absolutely was impressed with the size of their bakery with some sugar free options.  I was almost a little overwhelmed by everything they had.  I can't wait to stop in some time to try one of there breakfast or lunch items."}
{"text":"Everything was still good on the main course, but alot of the other items I sampled had various issues.
Apricot Rugelach - stale
Cinnamon Rugelach - getting stale
Bagels - small and just not good at all

The Jewish sliders to go still were great as were the fries. Overall, I will stick to the food now, not the bakery."}
{"text":"My Mother would have walked out after tasting their yellow chicken soup.  Why couldn't they make it fresh?  The Matzah balls were awful.  I can't imagine what cheap mix they used.  I understand buying a mix, but how about Streits or Manischewitz???  This was brand X.  The soup came from a mix or a can or was just plain old.  Very disappointing because Lovey never ran her operation like this.  I tried to give it a two star, but just couldn't.  It was that bad.  How easy to make a fresh pot of Chicken Soup?  We went there because we came in from out of town, my husband was sick and felt like chicken soup and there was none in my fridge.  That was Monday.  Last nite, I made my own pot and we were both pleased."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Ordered a cinnamon roll (this is a bakery) and original French toast. 
Cinnamon roll should have NEVER  been served, very dry and hard! Wasn't even heated up. French toast was dripping in grease. Gave me instant indigestion.  Waitress didn't return to our table with coffee or to check on us until she came to give us our check. Coffee cup EMPTY! 
We paid for the coffee and French toast and left never to return! Also wanted to say gentleman sitting next to us complained to the waitress that his breakfast was cold! He didn't have time to wait for a new breakfast. He told us he had waited for a very long time for his breakfast to come out of the kitchen. 
I must say though all of their bakery items look delicious. Just our experience was not good!"}
{"text":"I live right next door to the PV Chompies and I would order from them all the time if not for the fact that their staff is totally incompetent and rude.  They can't put together a take-out order to save their lives.  Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else.  There are tons of MUCH better places nearby that have great food and great service."}
{"text":"The food was good, much better than Miracle Mile. The only thing I found odd was that they were serving alcohol to a bunch of obnoxious and loud kids at 10AM on a Saturday morning. Drunken, tattooed limp bizkit wannabes don't do much for the atmosphere of the place. 

Other than that, I thought it was well worth the trip."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had lunch there on a Tuesday afternoon. Our waiter was very busy, but excellent. Food was fantastic (Corned beef Reuben, Matzo ball soup, Turkey Sandwich), bought deserts to go from bakery (Halvah - way sweeter than I ever made it, cheesecake, chocolate cake). I haven't had a dining experience like that since I moved here from CA six years ago (Californians are spoiled). Even though it's just a deli, my daughter asked me if that's where I want to go for my birthday! I said \"yes.\" To us, quality of food is important, but so is courtesy, friendliness, service, cleanliness, and atmosphere. It seems in AZ we often have to forgo two or more attributes when we eat out. Not here."}
{"text":"Picked this place to celebrate a birthday.   I thought it was tasty.  Portions are huge so you can share if you're in to that.  We all ordered different things and it all looked so GOOD."}
{"text":"Chompie's used to be one of my favs, i used to eat there all the time a couple of years ago, today i went to the shea location, which i always used  to goto & it was pathetic..ordered the \"aaron\" sandwich, the sweet potatoe fries were so bad & soggy even the waiter said, taste those & tell me if they are good before i said anything..they replaced & still were horrible..the bread tasted stale..there was literally a smidge of cole slaw instead of actually having cole slaw on the sandwich..it was just horrible..i wasted my time & my apetite on junk..oh ya plus $25 for a bad time!

ps: the place is looking pretty run down & didn't smell too good inside (which another reviewer also mentioned)

i'm not sure if management changed or what.....how ever the service was good & the manager came to ask me if the food was good after the waiter told her about the fries being so bad, but i just said, yes all is good thanks...didn't want to sit and complain!"}
{"text":"Our 1st time a Chompies & it was fab!  My Hubby had the Philly & he loved it!  He was barely able to finish it!  I had the Turkey with cranberry/mayo on w/wheat, I almost couldn't bite it, but it was delish!  These portions are huge, but we had to take home some desert!  We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Yesterday morning I picked up a delievery order, from Chomies, the male cashier had a slight attitude when I asked him to check off the order.  I'm more than half way to the customers home, when I receive a phone call from Chompies the male cashier stating he left out a meal. This is why I kindly asked him to check off the order with me. Well this small error  caused a huge domino affect. Chompies order arrived after the promise delievery time, along with 2nd delievery.  Chompies didn't meet the expectations of having the meal correct and ready at the promised time. Also Chompies tablet was missing so they had to get the customers order from me the driver.  Way out of order.  I think these issues need to be brought to dashers attention."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Food was delicious. Service at counter could use a little help. Had to wait while try looked for someone to ring me."}
{"text":"Great Jewish deli!!!!!!!  Definitely coming back with my family when they visit in from new York!!!"}
{"text":"I love stopping by at Chompies when I'm craving a deli sandwich or new york style bagel! Everything is so delicious with large portions. I always get their bagel and joe combo if I'm in a rush. The atmosphere feels like a busy deli in NYC. The service is excellent and very attentive. Their omelettes are excellent and come with a choice of bagel on the side. Its big enough for two people! This seems more of a breakfast/lunch place to me though as I've never been for dinner."}
{"text":"Tasty tasty.  Had the breakfast tacos.  The egg, sausage, onion scramble was scrumptious but my tortillas were overcooked and in pieces.  Service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Well, it was one of those mornings that started good and then took a turn.  Happy to be getting up early and getting some b-fast with my BF and even more excited to be getting out of our typical 5 mile radius.  Trying a new place was the cherry on top!

Chompie's menu is gigantic and I was only looking at breakfast.  So much to choose from, I almost felt lost.  Pulled my typical move of narrowing it down to two or three and ask the server.  He recommended the Athens Skillet (sauteed spinach, artichokes, mushrooms, onions, garlic, tomato, feta, and jack cheese topped with two eggs and served over potatoes). I knew it was going to be a ton of food, but decided I could take it home to enjoy tomorrow.

Three things made this experience not my favorite, mostly my own fault and having nothing to do with Chompie's.  1) Something was off with Google Maps, so I was not able to 'check-in' using the Yelp app, it said I was a mile away.  Bummer.  2) Attempting to take that first bite of my delicious skillet, I cut into the egg with my fork and received a explosion of yolk on my shirt and white shorts.  Ugh!  3) When leaving the table, I left my huge box of leftovers sitting on the table.  *tear*

What can we all learn from my mishaps?  1) If you choose to eat your egg yolk runny, pierce it softly before diving in or maybe use your had to cover much like squeezing a lemon into a drink.  2) Put your leftovers somewhere that you have to take them to get out of the booth, maybe in your lap?

So, while I wasn't happy when I got home from Chompie's, I am still excited to return and do it right this time!"}
{"text":"Went to my first UYE (thanks Jim & Audrey!) & enjoyed meeting other yelpers, who gave some great insight to their experiences & reviews. 

It was a great time & the food was great too! I had my introduction to fried matzo balls & potato pancakes, um..... both were awesome! Who knew that applesauce & sour cream would be so good together as a topping, obviously someone did & they were right. If you've never had matzo ball chicken soup, I suggest you try it. Note: it's the best when you are feeling under the weather! Also tried Rugulach - don't even know how to pronounce that correctly, but it's very similar to Baklava, so if you like that you won't be disappointed & it comes in a variety of flavors.
I have to say I like this Chompies better than the one in Tempe for a number of reasons.... but mainly because it's so much closer to my house! Lol :) 
Give it a whirl, you won't be sorry, and if you're not sure about what to get - ask your server - they are very friendly & informative! Good job tonight with such a big group & thanks for the extras!!

*****OH YEAH... BTW - THE GOOGLE MAP ADDRESS ON HERE IS WRONG - IT PUTS YOU IN SOME FAR AWAY NEIGHBORHOOD. THE DELI IS RIGHT BEHIND THE CHANDLER MALL. IN THE SPORTS AUTHORITY, BED BATH & BEYOND, DSW, ETC. PARKING LOT. JUST FYI*****"}
{"text":"Matzoh ball soup like mom used to make. Brisket like Passover at Aunt Joanne's. Stuffed Cabbage rolls like my bubbie would make   Walked out stuffed like Shabbos dinner at the Machatunum and enough leftovers for tomorrow's lunch!  I'm a big fan!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. I had the meatloaf. The portion was big, and really tasty. I had mashed potatoes, and glazed carrots. They were fresh and tasty. Then, I had to grab a few pastries. I had a small eclair and it was awesome. The service staff were very friendly, the place was nice and clean, the restrooms were clean. It reminded me of a deli in Manhattan and a diner in upstate were mixed. I will be back for a pastrami sandwich, and breakfast."}
{"text":"Love the simple clean chicken schnitzel.  Juicy and flavorful with a nice egg wash. Getting a baked good on the way about is always a good idea."}
{"text":"This has been our \"go to\" for Jewish style deli for many years. However, we've noticed a significant decline in the quality and quantity of food as well as a service. Our recent two visits are examples. The mile high beef brisket had so little meat I questioned if it was the mile high. We used to get enough fries to share but on a recent visit there were 8 fries by count. Last night when it was less than a quarter full we left after waiting more than a half hour for simple sandwiches. I've noticed that the manager who had been there many years is no longer there and hasn't been replaced. The hostess indicated it was new cooks. The waitress said there was only one person preparing food. Don't actually know the whys but the result is a decline in food value and service. But, the result is loosing our business."}
{"text":"Hit the desserts at Chompie's. While shopping at Arrowhead Mall, my Sweet Tooth was cravin' chocolate and fruit. Chompie's had a 2 for 1 sale. With the recommendation of the server, I picked the Seven Layer Chocolate Cake. I am not usually a fan of fruit tarts, but this one was pretty, and I was in need of something fruity. 

Seven Layer Chocolate: 3 star. It was okay. It was a little dry, and had too much cream in between the layers. The chocolate was not very chocolaty. It lacked luster.

Fruit Tart: 5 star tart. The custard was a perfect complement to the fresh fruit. The gelatin coat was light and non-obtrusive. The pie base was the perfect thickness. It was tasty and had a great texture. The combination was fabulous. I can't wait to get another one soon."}
{"text":"Ok mind you I grew up with Chompies. as a child we would go bowling and go next door and get bagles on sunday morning. That was near Shea and 32nd street where they first started.

I hadn't been to chompies in years but always bought their goods in the grocery store.  I was expecting the great atmosphere of my childhood.  The brothers in the back cooking and a few New Yorker men up front kicking some customer service ass and getting people their bagels and cream cheese in a quick manner.  

I was disapointed when I arrived at 730 am on a saturday (late as far as I was concerned for a bakery). There were a bevy of beautiful young girls behind the counter no line and It still took me over 15min to get two bagels toasted with cream cheese to go.  Yes I was already in a bad mood but this was totaly flipping me out. I felt like jumping back there and getting it done for them.  

The bagles are still good.  Not as good as I remember them but it hit the spot.

so yes they still get four stars but PLEASE start teaching the help how to get things done a bit quicker."}
{"text":"I always enjoy this restaurant! I usually eat lunch here, and to my surprise, I was pleased to find exactly what I wanted to order on the Gluten Free menu.  I got the Egg White veggie omelette with a side of fruit and a gluten free roll toasted with veggie lite cream cheese. DELISH! 
I enjoy the gluten free rolls here. The gluten free bagels are good too, but I think they might use too much xanthan gum which leaves me feeling bloated.  
They have a separate display area offering gluten free baked goods to go. I bought the four pack of gf black and white cookies (for my mom, of course. That's my story and I'm sticking to it! LOL)  By the way, they were pretty darn good! 
My only negative is that the restaurant could use a fresh coat of paint and a little sprucing up. I will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE TODAY! I could not believe the disrespectful manner on how I was treated as a faithful customer.  I normally visit this location every couple of months.  TODAY I ordered the Denver omelet and it came out with burnt potatoes and a flat omelet with non melted cheese. I returned it and immediately got talked down by the manager like it was MY fault my order was not edible.  She had the nerve to recommend that I ask for under cooked potatoes next time. These potatoes were not only overcooked they were burnt.  The management did not take fault at what they did wrong and instead blamed the customer who has been visiting this location for many years, spending my money for service that is normally good, but NOT TODAY. I asked for my money back and with attitude she gave it back. The manager initially didn't return the full price that I paid, thinking I would just walk away. I had to pull up the charge on my credit card statement to show she still owed me money. Then she tried giving me change from the tip jar. I don't want that workers hard earned tip money. Just tacky! Nobody cares for your fake apology when your manners tell me a  different tune. Wow...I have never been disrespected like this in my life. Chompies, you lost my loyalty and my business. Shame on you."}
{"text":"I like that they offer a Gluten Free menu as well as gluten free bagels and rolls. I particularly like the gluten free everything bagel. Their bagels are fresh, which is much better than other options which are typically frozen. Yuk! I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I should have written this review a long time ago. Something changed with Chompies a while ago and it's not a good one. I have been coming here ever since they were at 32st and Greenway. They used to have the best pastrami sandwich out there. They also used to have fantastic baked goods. Now, there pastrami is sub standard. It's fatty, it's chewy, it's flavorless and it's about half the size it used to be. This has been at least 8 times in a town now. $14 for a small, very poor quality pastrami sandwich is inexcusable. 
   I had lunch here yesterday and I was so disappointed that I ended up at Jimmy Johns later that night and they put the crap Chompies served me to shame. That's pretty bad to have a chain sub shop have a better quality sandwich then a so-called New York style deli that's been in business for years. 
    Sadly, there baked goods have gone through the same extreme drop in quality as there food. I always end up getting a black and white cookie to go after my meal. These are my favorite cookies. I'm from New York and my parents and I have been eating these for about 40 years. Chompies B/W's used to be nice and soft and had a great frosting. Now, they are hard and dried out with no flavor. 
     I'm sorry guys, but your food has gone all the way down hill. Your obviously skimping on everything now. Which of course means I will not be eating at Chompies every again. I really hate it when owners ruin a good thing."}
{"text":"The food is great!  The drinks with breakfast is fan-freakin-tastic!  The service is OK.  I actually want to give them more stars, but consistently the group of girls I go with is ignored at the end of our meal, we would get more drinks, like water refills, and like to pay our check quicker.  The good thing is they don't often mess up our order and our orders are often difficult, so that is really nice.
I usually get the French omelet and greyhound, the eggs are always fluffy and yummy and the salt bagel with lox cream cheese makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  
I would recommend and take anyone to Chompie's, I would warn them about the service before so to set the expectations."}
{"text":"Just got back from this location, having not eaten. The mashed potatoes were cold, as was the stuffing. The roast chicken was cold and dry. I sent it back for another try, and it was the same! I've had bad fast food chicken that was much better than this. It seems that there is no pride in what they serve here. I've had the same dish at the PV mall location, and it was always fine. To be fair, my server was friendly and helpful. But she couldn't help the poor quality of the food. The next time I'm in the area, I'll eat any place else."}
{"text":"If this was a restaurant that strictly focused on just their sliders, then I would give 5 stars easy. But there is some serious menu bloat that confuses a lot of people and worst of all Chompie's is not very good at making all of those items.

I brought two of my friends who never been there and they were very overwhelmed by the menu. They knew the sliders were obviously good but they wanted to try the other options first and just have a jewish slider on the side

One of them ordered a fried chicken plate and the other a salmon (off of the section that highlights \"New York's Favorites\" so you would assume as a customer that Chompie's was good at making them), and both of them were terrible. Both were overcooked and dry while the sliders were excellent, telltale signs of people in the kitchen who weren't that experience in those items at all.

So yeah, as a reviewer you have to judge Chompie's as a whole. You can give 5 stars for the jewish sliders, but you might trick unintentionally trick people into coming to Chompie's and potentially have a 1 or 2 star experience. Having a bakery /restaurant combo inside is very cool and I've never seen anything like that, but the restaurant part needs to renew their menu to their strengths.

Streamlining and having perhaps maybe 10 or so of their best items is much better than to have the 40 or 50 choices you see on the menu.

Off-Topic: In a perfect world, I wish that Chompie's branch off into becoming a fast food burger shop and compete with the In'n'Out's and Chik-Fil-A's with their sliders. I can only dream....."}
{"text":"I brought a friend with me to try the gluten free lunch. From soups, sandwiches to Belgian waffles there are so many fabulous choices. We were both very pleased with our selections."}
{"text":"Probably the best place in Paradise Valley for bagels they also serve a really nice breakfast."}
{"text":"This place never, ever disappoints! I always leave full and satisfied. So far my favorite is the French toast...mmmmm. The New York style and the Bobka Crumb with bananas! The parfait with fruit is good and their bagels are huge!! So good. Their prices are a bit more than other places but portion sizes are bigger than most as well. This will continue to be one of my favorite breakfast and lunch spots."}
{"text":"Chimpie's has been around a long time. It's a solid average. Not great. Not terrible.  Consistently average."}
{"text":"Pretty boring sandwich, unless you just really like meat. Service was downright rude. Overheard the server talking smack about us because we were disappointed with our meal. Pricey. Wont be back. Used to go there all the time when they were more authentic."}
{"text":"My family went to Chompies  in Tempe today for a late lunch around 3pm. There was a large party of more than 30 people in the center room, and open booths near the door. The hostess took us into the center, very noisy room, & when we asked to be seated in a booth away from the large party, she said that she couldn't because they didn't have enough wait staff to cover our table in the quieter section. We asked to speak to a manager to see if they could make an exception, & after waiting for several minutes, the hostess came back, & told us that the manager wasn't going to come out, & that the manager told her to tell us that if we didn't want to sit at the  table offered next to the large party, we could leave. Of course, we left, & will never go back. Wrecked our afternoon. 

P.S.  We have been to the Chompies at Chandler Mall many times, & have always had great food and service."}
{"text":"I love the food here, I only go for the breakfast so I don't know anything about their lunch or dinner. I eat here 2 times a week. The breakfast is a large portion of everything. I read some of the reviews about cockroaches. I have seen one cockroach one time. What I found out was the main sewer for the entire mall is right next to the restuarant, that's why they have a problem with these creatures, but it hasn't stopped me from going there. There is another location in Tempe to choose from."}
{"text":"Just average food and average service. I probably won't return. 
I asked for no mushrooms and OJ and I had to ask for my oj and dig around shrooms....
My wife's French toast was just average."}
{"text":"Great service, loved the bagels and lox brunch. Amazing gluten free options, fantastic bakery section. Bought son lox from the deli section. Go to this place every chance you get."}
{"text":"I love all the gluten free options. This morning I ordered the bagels and lox. Great food, great service for our group of five. I'd give five stars but there's always such a long line at the deli because there's only one cash register. Maybe that's to retain some semblance of order but if that's the case the workers need to work faster. We stood in line for fifteen minutes to pay for an order we'd called in the day before. The man ringing us up was the one who took our call and he still couldn't get our order correct on the first try."}
{"text":"Great food! Our server Jason was great, kept the coffee coming. There were plenty of gluten free options so I ate heartily. The smoked salmon was amazing. I've had the whitefish before and that's just as good. The gluten free bagels are so good. I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast.  Good traditional American breakfast fare.  Big portions! Nothing spectacular but decent.  Service is friendly and quick.  Prices fair and what you'd expect."}
{"text":"this place has excellent Lox. its a little expensive but they have almost EVERYTHING you would want to eat there. 
Get the lox in the morning. so good."}
{"text":"The experience was okay. I don't think I will be visiting Chompie's anytime soon for breakfast though.

Our server was nice and was quick to take our order. The food took about 30 minutes to come out, which is longer than normal for breakfast. When our food came out, my eggs were burnt, not soft scrambled, and were sent back. My husband's eggs were soft scrambled, but super runny. Overall, the food tasted fine. The bagels were the best, of course.

To finish the experience, it took a while to get our check and boxes."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of weeks ago and was very surprised at how great everything was - from the service to the food to the diverse menu. To begin, we were given pickles as a bit of an appetizer for free. The manager came to our table a couple of times to check on us, and she was very sweet and informative. She suggested that we try an Arnold Palmer with pink lemonade and iced tea which was absolutely delicious. I ordered a cheeseburger with onion rings and my mom ordered a chicken ranch sandwich - both of which were were very tasty. Right before we left, we stopped by the inside bakery and ordered some cookies which were also very delicious and affordable. The overall experience at this location was amazing, you can definitely tell that customer service is definitely at its prime here."}
{"text":"I have to say the level of customer service that I was provided at this Chompies was absolutely amazing!!! The young girl who helped me was friendly, polite, helpful - everything you want a great customer experience to be. 

I stopped in to get sweet treats for an office celebration and loved the variety of cookies and pastries they had to offer. Everyone in the office thoroughly enjoyed everything and we didn't have an leftover, which I was pretty sad about because I wanted more.

I have eaten here for breakfast as well, not this time, but previously and love their breakfast bagel skins! These are not healthy at all for you, but most certainly yummy.

Check out Chompies for great service, good food, and delicious sweet treats!"}
{"text":"Great Rueben and great looking place. Nice waitresses. I'd recommend to stop by here. Kinda pricey.... But worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered the San Jose omelette.  It arrived looking like a 4 year old prepared it.  It was runny, bland and resembled something you might get at a soup kitchen.  Across the way, we had an older dude sitting at the bar farting aloud (seriously)...  Ordered a couple deserts to go; got home, one was the wrong one and both were stale and should have been pulled.  On toilet 3 times last night.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"By far the best bagel I've ever eaten. Service was great, food was great. Wish they had this restaurant in Kingman. 
New York style decor and food."}
{"text":"I've visited this Chompie's a handful of times and the quality of the service has gone down with each visit. It's like as soon as the servers take your order they disappear, only to show up to deliver your food and give you the check. They rarely show up for refills, and when flagged down to do so, they act like they have something better to do.

During my last visit, 5/16/2017, I noticed my server would give the older diners impeccable service only to give the younger diners horrible service. She looked my way a handful of times but never came over to refill our drinks. She only offered to refill my wife's coffee when she quickly dropped off the check. Usually most servers ask everyone at the table if they're ready for a refill...nope not this one. It's as if she knew the older diners would tip her well so she treated them with the best service. Guess what, I tip well if you deserve it. If i receive good service, you'll get a decent tip. Don't assume the younger crowd won't tip well; give everyone the same quality service and you'll see the difference in amount of tips you make.

The food was still great, but with the quality of service I received, I'd rather order out instead."}
{"text":"Chompies serves good breakfasts all day as well as lunch and dinner. The bakery and deli are nice and offer specials on day-old bagels and other promotions such as buy one dozen bagels get a second dozen half off etc.  there is nothing spectacular about the food but it is consistent and good.  The service is about the same."}
{"text":"Chompies is awful, my New Year's resolution is to never step foot in a chompies again. The food is always mediocre at best. The service is always super slow no matter how busy it is. I swear that they put some sort of laxative in the eggs because I can never get home quick enough. If you like crappy deli food go to Chompies , if you like halfway decent deli go to Scott's."}
{"text":"Tracy is the most hospitable, friendly uninterrupting waitress at the Chandler Chompies. Love this gal!  Will request her for future visits.

I ordered the strawberry pancakes with the whip cream and graham cracker crumbs.  But I made a request to get bananas and walnuts added, since the banana pancakes sounded good, too.  Tracy didn't bat an eye before saying the request wasn't a problem.  Can do attitude! No who doesn't appreciate that when you are teetering between two menu choices.  Thanks for making my morning!"}
{"text":"I liked the roast beef sandwich on rye quite a bit. My mother enjoyed the blintzes- just a tad bland. The menu has numerous selections. It is reasonably authentic to New York. I would come back here again. This place is very kid friendly. It's so loud that if your child was crying no one could hear!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast but the sandwiches looked so good that I switched up and went with one of their specialties.  It was very good and very big. Took half away with me for leftovers. Everyone was happy with their orders and the service was friendly. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I was visiting from California and I did see this on Man V Food. So, my gf and I decided to come here before watching a Spring Training game (SF WORLD CHAMPION GIANTS vs Oakland A's). This isn't too far from the airport so if you are staying in the area, definitely come here. The line wasn't too bad and we were seated within 20 minutes. Good atmosphere and everyone was wearing some kind of Arizona team shirt.

We ordered 2 sliders which were good for each of us as a starter. We both loved the challah bread. But then I also wanted to eat something else as a main course. My gf ordered the beef brisket sandwich which was just as good as the sliders but more meat. The meat was thinly sliced and very tender. She could only eat half of the sandwich so she took the other half to-go which she ate later in the hotel which turned out to be a great snack later. I had the turkey and roast beef sandiwch (I can't remember the name of the sandwich) but it was too much for us. I was definitely full and I'm glad we came here before the game because we'd be eating dogs n drinking beer all day long.

Waitress was attentive and we did have a good experience. I'd definitely come here again when we visit."}
{"text":"Best corned beef sandwich I've had anywhere at anytime. Definitely great portions of food. The jewish sliders are very good especially with the potato pancakes. Too bad they aren't in California because I can see myself visiting this a lot."}
{"text":"Food is good but the wait time for a larger party is always crazy so don't bring more than four. They have teen agers running the front desk with no sense of urgency for customers. Maybe they should have an adult up front to manage the place at night because when the owner is there during a Saturday or Sunday morning we have never had an issue.  Complained to manger and never ate tonight the wait was forty five minutes with it not even being busy!! Sorry need to review your staff better Chompies they get lazy when the cat is away!!"}
{"text":"Got a chicken chop chop salad, it was good but the dressing that was supposed to come with it they didn't have and I was not aware of this until my salad almost came out. That was a bummer. I love me a balsamic  vinaigrette dressing. The salad really didn't have that much chicken. I really like a salad with plenty of chicken. My mom also got a salad, BBQ chopped chicken salad. The ranch that comes with the salad is not good. I love ranch but this ranch is not good at all! My moms plate for her salad was dirty and crusty on the outside of the plate which was pretty gross. As soon as you lifted up the plate there were, brown, black spots, and old food stuck to the outside. Dirty!"}
{"text":"It's simple. I really wanted - scratch that - NEEDED a pastrami sandwich on Christmas. And thanks to some wonderful cultural differences, Chompie's was open. The rest is history."}
{"text":"A local friend recommended we hit Chompies while we were in the area, and we're so glad we did! 

As far as Kosher deli's go, it's one of our fav's.  We had the hot corned beef, matzo ball soup and split pea soup, plus picked up some adorable cakes for the kids that were frosted with mice and frogs!  The bakery alone was worth the trip, but the sandwich was pilled high with juicy corned beef, and they delivered it just as we asked for it!

The plain bagels weren't as good as Einstein's but in their defense, our kids didn't want them toasted....

Grab some to-go or eat it there."}
{"text":"I was craving lox and cream cheese on an everything bagel, and so it was an easy decision to head here. The bagels are fab, the lox is fresh, and simply I know it would be exactly what I wanted. 
In that respect, perfect to fill the void.
Upon first entering, it's a little confusing. You first notice the take-out area, which is just all around a little sloppy and ill-organized.
Then you notice the hostess, and she is quick to seat you. The dining room is larger than expected, it extends all the way through to a back room.
The menu is extensive, and everything sounds delish. 

I'm disappointed with the ambiance. Considering the high quality of the food and menu selections, I'd feel more comfortable if the place was more similar to like a Paradise Bakery instead of an IHOP...
I also think a little breakfast bar would be perfect here. It was weird getting full waiter service for an easy little bagel sandwich. 

They do have a full bar, so I naturally ordered a mimosa to celebrate a day off work ;). (Thank you MLK!) It was good. Not the best, not the worst. 

I ordered a large mimosa, a bagel with lox and cream cheese, and a side of avocado. I considered my $18 tab a bit steep. 

Will I return? Yes, but probably just for take-out. And only because I every once in awhile crave a good bagel with lox and cream cheese, and this place hits the spot. Unfortunately, the \"cons\" --namely the IHOP atmosphere and steep price tag -- are not enough for me to justify sitting down and exploring the menu more extensively."}
{"text":"This place was great and definitely plan on going back. The food was delicious (and at a very affordable price) and the service was also great. Our waitress (forgot her name) was very attentive and other customers seemed like they were getting good service as well. Plus they have a cute little display case with goodies right when you come in, cute."}
{"text":"Ive never been disappointed with the service or the food!The chili cheese fries are the best hands down!!!"}
{"text":"Chompie's is an easy 5-bomb.  I would be embarrassed to tell you how many times I have been here, it's probably in the hundreds and I have tried just about everything I had any interest in eating. The Breakfast Chomp-adilla would probably be the favorite, just a glorious, gluttonous way to begin a morning (or early afternoon). Portions are huge and it seems like everything comes with a bagel and cream cheese on the side if you'd like it. The deli sandwiches are huge and high quality.

Also tough to beat the waiter named Mitch, who is just the prototype New York sarcastic wiseass, and who might be the funniest guy on the planet without even trying."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed yet.  Today got the Jewish sliders, just simply great meal. Along with the chicken soup, yum,yum,yummy.  I also love they have bialys, I usually get the corned beef hash and get a bialy. Of course the side of pickles is a great compliment to the meal. Only drawback at this place, parking. Been to PV location, but Tempe is my favorite. Plus the Chompie's Rewards is an added plus."}
{"text":"What can you say about Chompie's - now, I have been to 3 locations, Tempe, PV and Scottsdale (which I will review).  Okay, I do love Chompie's - I have always looked at their desserts; but have never partaken of them; because I am always so full.  The service is fast and efficient; and if you are a regular, very friendly.  It does look like the staff has worked their for years. The waits are long!!! But, once seated the service is extremely fast!
Just give me a sesame bialy (I have to settle for an everything bialy)."}
{"text":"The Athens Skillet is AWESOME!  Too much to eat at one sitting (it comes w 2 eggs and a Bagel on the side), so enough for leftovers. Great place, oy."}
{"text":"I like the breakfast here. But couple of days ago I bought 6 assorted bagels. I noticed the bagel baskets were almost empty but I bought them anyways. i should have checked at the store but when i got home all of them were hard as a rock except one. Just ended up eating that one bagel and the rest were just too rock hard to eat or even to slice. Never buying bagels here again. Tossed the rest in the trash."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Great Jewish deli food. Might be our new Sunday breakfast stop."}
{"text":"Relative to Carnegie's in NYC, Langer's in LA, Zingerman's in Ann Arbor and other world class delis, Chompie's gets a 4. Relative to anything else in AZ, it's more like a 5. The food is on the mark, the selection is very good and the PV location ambiance and service are great. Plus one has to love the fact that it's a sit-down restaurant, a walk-up deli, a coffee shop, a sports bar and an outdoor patio all-in-one. The only draw-back seems to be the longer-than-average waits... no doubt a reflection on the popularity of the place. Although they probably could use a couple more workers in the kitchen and servers on the floor to handle the volume of customers."}
{"text":"Our waiter was so amazing, we went for kids eat free Tuesday, and the food was great! The female manager was quite horrible though. Was ready to come back again soon because it was such a great experience but the manager made me change my mind. To the manager: if your staff represents a deal as being a certain way, and the patrons have already eaten the food, you have to honor the representation (especially when possible discrepancies had been brought up AND clarified before ordering). You cannot show up after the food has been eaten and say you can't honor the deal. Yes you can honor it, and you just embarrassed a patron, your waiter, and yourself by that useless confrontation. What am I supposed to do, un-eat the food?"}
{"text":"Straight up bad arse!  Pickle spears for the table-check, friendly, personable staff-check, brinner-check, Pastrami-check, the list could go on.  Bottom line great food."}
{"text":"I'm not a big proponent of reading reviews restaurants however is my honest recommendation that you avoid this location at all costs especially if you're trying to order food for pick up before you go into work. The deli counter is bizarre you swap why does it take 20 minutes to toast a bagel or some throw some cream cheese on it. That's a did you actually order something that needs to be cooked you talk to 25 minutes plus. Avoid this place unless you have an extra 30 minutes to eat or more likely spend standing around doing nothing."}
{"text":"Breakfast - was amazing!!!! Cheese omelet, home fries, sour dough toast, coffee... The atmosphere is really neat, the mural of Broadway/NYC on the wall was awesome! Waitstaff was friendly, air temp was comfortable, seating was ample, clearly family friendly (as there were people of all ages here), enormous menu - something for everyone!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Tempe for the week, and after watching the episode of Man V Food for this place, I have been wanting to try it out. Got there and split an Original Slider dish with my brother, 3 sliders with brisket and the potato pancake (which just takes like a hashbrown, was expecting more, maybe a little more crispiness). And we also upgraded to the delicious onion straws and it came with a tasty gravy and I think also some chipotle, which I couldn't stop eating. $11.99 + $2.99 for the onion straws

Tried some Hot Pastrami on Sourdough sliced bread, it was... eh. I thought I read that the pastrami was supposed to be really good but I might have read wrong or something. I guess we found out the pastrami was steamed later, so thats why the pastrami had a weird texture and not too much flavor, but oh well. Came with choice of potato salad or coleslaw. $7.99

Also tried some Lovey's Oreo Cheesecake just for the hell of it. The temperature was cool, I prefer it colder. But not bad. On the menu it was $5.25, but they charged us $4.95. 

Also came some pickles. The service was nice and quick.

All in all, decent food, sliders were the best part, great service, I probably won't be back since I'm only here for a week, but at least I can finally say I tried it."}
{"text":"Ahhh, this place is great.  Love love love the breakfast.  We had great service this morning.
The only problem is the bakery area.  It always seems a little disorganized back there."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix on vacation from our home in Oregon and talking about food, our favorite subject, with a local  resident and commenting that we sure wished we could find a good bagel. That led him to tell us about Chompies where he said one could find not only great bagels but other Jewish bakery delights.  So off we went the next morning to Chompie's for breakfast.

First to say one of us is originally from New York, Brooklyn to be exact, and so \"are you talkin'' to ME?\"  attitude at service counters is not new to us.  Nor is it even a problem for us...you can't eat friendly service, after all.  And sometimes a little 'tude even makes us feel like we are home.  But, the attitude of the counter staff at Chompie's was a bit much, even for us.

Then, it turns out that the pastries and cookies we bought were just OK...not bad Hammentaschen and rugelah, as example, but not the best we've had either.  Not to mention way too expensive.  The wait for a table was a LONG one but when we were finally seated the waiter who served us at breakfast was pretty friendly (and with a NY accent you could cut with a knife - music to our ears).   But the prices for breakfast really were outrageous.  

Still,  here is the saving grace that makes this a three star and not a two star rating.  The fried egg and bagel sandwich one of us had for breakfast was good..  And the chopped liver and onions on a bagel with a side of coleslaw the other one of us had was really good. (Coleslaw is too a breakfast food.)  Maybe it's because we hadn't been able to get chopped liver for some time, but it was very tasty indeed.  

That said, we're soon to be in Phoenix again and based on reviews from other Yelpers, this time for our chopped liver and bagel fix we'll try Scott's Deli instead."}
{"text":"Lovey is so sweet, walking around each table every Sunday making sure her customers are happy. The lox is divine. The bagel selection is impressive. It's my absolute favorite Sunday brunch choice!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place !!! The food is great and portions are BIG!!! What we especially like about Chompie's is the staff. Meghan, the host is ADORABLE!!! She greets everyone with the brightest, sweetest smile and really makes you feel welcomed. She truly gets that she is the \"Welcome Mat\" for the whole place and sets the tone for your dining experience!!!! Such an important first impression!!!! 
 Our server, Arthur was great too. He had a great sense of humor and was very attentive and fun. 
We will make this a regular place to enjoy for sure!!"}
{"text":"Okay, I have a problem - I'm a corned beef hash addict!  I love their different selections of corned beef hash selections. Just had the corned beef hash omelet with cheddar cheese - my new favorite; but the corned beef hash benedict is also good. I've also had the corned beef hash skillet along with just the corned beef hash & eggs.  Now, if they did the sliders with corned beef hash; I might have to try...LOL!!! I love a lot of everything they have on the menu; and other items I have had are outstanding.  But, there is one item that has my heart is Corned Beef Hash!  Well also Bialys (just wish they had sesame bialy).

UPDATE: they do have corned beef hash sliders!!! I'll be on my way back soon!"}
{"text":"Good place for a sandwich but definitely not blown away. Service is decent but nothing I would suggest to someone."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Chompie's bagels so my boyfriend and I decided to stop in for breakfast one day. It was a gorgeous Scottsdale morning and they had tables set up outside but we were seated inside and were told they simply weren't serving outside... Didn't seem to make any sense to me but oh well. 
Our server was a sweet woman who checked on us regularly but ultimately the food just wasn't anything to marvel at... I had a breakfast sandwich and it was truly not noteworthy ... My boyfriend had a breakfast plate and was equally unimpressed with the potato pancake and overall meal. 
What a bummer that a place with great bagels and seemingly great staff was so hindered by just a so-so meal. Doubt we would be back for dining in... Especially since there is no reason to not try and enjoy the morning patio weather before the summer heat kicks in!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our brunch outside. Good service, fast delivery of our cocktails and food."}
{"text":"Beyond horrible! Being from and living in NY City most of my life, it is an insult to even compare this greasy spoon to any NYC deli. It's evident that Arizona's deli going population lacks taste buds for real deli food. Words of warning. If you dine here be prepared to crap up an oil slick for 2 days after!"}
{"text":"Use to love this place.  It was the place for me to go when I felt homesick from NY.  Not so much anymore.  Nothing tastes as good as it use too.  It wAs a much better restaurant at 32nd street.  Prices aren't very good either.  Not so much a fan as of lately."}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix and had heard about this place from Man vs Food so we decided to try it out on 10/16/2015.  I'm a big fan of deli food so my expectations are moderately high.

We arrived on a Friday night around 6:30p and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away.  The server was very pleasant and very prompt.  He was busy, but always quick to check on us and re-fill our drinks.
 
We ordered a egg with cheese kids' meal for my daughter. The portion was extremely generous, in fact, too much for my daughter to eat.  There was a large portion of eggs along with sliced potatoes, bacon and a whole bagel.  I ordered the Jewish Slider plate with matzoh ball soup and coleslaw.  The portion of coleslaw was very small and initially I was disappointed.  However, I couldn't finish the rest of the food on my plate anyway so in hindsight, I was actually glad the portion was a small one.  The soup was very flavorful and the matzoh ball was light and fluffy.  The brisket melted in my mouth and the potato pancakes were perfect.  My husband ordered the Philly Cheesesteak with wedge fries.  It was served open faced due to the generous heaping of cheesesteak.  He said it was flavorful and perfectly cooked.

After dinner, we selected a peanut butter brownie and the almond horn to take home for a late night snack.  Both were very good.  The brownie was super-moist and rich.  The Almond Horn was crisp, sweet and filled with almond paste.  It was actually too sweet for me to finish in one sitting.  It became dessert for three nights.  I also purchased a box of house-made biscotti to take home. I had the first one today with my coffee and it was everything I expected and more.  There was a copious helping of almonds and chocolate.  It was the perfect addition to my coffee.

The atmosphere is open and decorated to resemble a NY Subway station.  We found the staff friendly and prompt with their service.  The two young men working in the deli were a little slow to respond, but then served us quickly.

We will definitely return when we come back to the Phoenix area so that I can try some of the other menu items that caught my eye."}
{"text":"Wasn't very impressed with this location. I ordered the Long Islander sandwich with French fries. The roast beef that was on the sandwich was VERY dry. So dry, that it was inedible. The turkey and the bread however were great. The fries were also very good.

I also ordered a small slice of carrot cake which was fairly moist and flavorful. That being said however, the almonds and frosting had an obvious stale taste. 

They also offered us a tray of pickles to snack on while we waited. The pickles tasted terrible and were very inconsistent. Some were very sour, others weren't pickled at all.

The only reason I gave three stars instead of two is due to the service. The waitress was very attentive and friendly, and the manager made a point to stop by the table."}
{"text":"Jewish sliders are really good, will try the BBQ sliders next time. Good service, this dinning location is smaller than the one Tempe but nonetheless, great place to eat."}
{"text":"It has been 10 years since I visited.  Everyone  raves about their pastrami.  The onion roll was firm and dense.  The meat was overcooked and too lean. The side coleslaw was so small. 16 dollars for sandwich seems high with portions a on the small size. Very disappointed.  The  owner did stop by to say  high"}
{"text":"First timer here. While in Tempe for the weekend, I couldn't leave without trying out this local favorite.

I walked in with no expectations or knowledge about this place besides being told that their menu is extensive. IT REALLY IS INTENSE! They kinda have a lot of everything lol

The wait on Saturday morning (St. Pattys Day) was about 15 minutes. We were seated outside on the patio and immediately ordered mimosas to start off our morning right! The mimosas are served in such large glasses I literally thought they mistakenly brought me orange juice.

I couldn't decide which breakfast plate to try so I ordered the Turkey BLT with a side of fruit :P It was pretty damn delicious!!! Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal. GREAT food, good service, fair prices. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"3 stars for food, 4 stars for pastries!

I used to visit Chompie's a lot when I lived in Tempe and treat myself to an assortment of their cookies, cakes, and bagels.  One will find New York inspired black-and-white cookies, Jewish pastries, and many other yummies.  Entrees are large and largely served with a (half) smile.  Prices are fairly reasonable and day-old baked goods are usually heavily discounted.  On my recent visit, I scored 2 maple espresso baby bundt cakes and a good size piece of red velvet cake for $7.25 (the bundt cakes were BOGO).  Party in my mouth!  

Come check this place out if you want a taste of the east coast."}
{"text":"Gluten free French toast was yummy. They have a good price range in terms of choices and very gluten free friendly menu which I appreciate. They however not dog friendly so be aware even with service dogs."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful breakfast here this morning! I was craving a bagel sandwich so of course, he took me to one of the best! What is better than a doughy NY bagel, exploding with fluffy eggs, sharp cheddar, and freshly shaved Boar's Head ham? YES, PLEASE! I also ordered a side of their home fries and man, was I happy camper! 

I've always been obsessed with Chompie's bagels but most often come in for a sandwich/lunchtime. We will absolutely be back for breakfast again soon because it was SO good and you get so much food for the price. I do hear they can get BUSY on weekends so just keep that in mind when making plans! But I promise you, they're worth the wait. ALSO, check in on Yelp for a free black and white cookie. And let me tell you, they taste like they're off the streets of Manhattan. So fresh and authentic. Their baked goods are seriously dreamy as well. 

I just love this local, family-owned and operated business. See you again soon, Chompie's!"}
{"text":"Our server was Edward, he was great. The food was okay, not the best but next time I'll try something different."}
{"text":"Chompie's is a Phoenix/Tempe institution. I've tried all the soups and the only one I'm not a fan of is the sweet & sour cabbage - otherwise, all that soups are joy-inducing."}
{"text":"This place is chompdiddleydoo flametastic. It makes you make weird noises out of your face like \"bangarang!\" or even loud pterodactyl screeches of goodness. 10/10 would come again, even if I had to travel the distance of 5,000 suns."}
{"text":"While visiting some friends in Phoenix I found this after discovering the hotel I was staying at breakfast was horrible.  Probably the best coffee I have ever had.  Service was on point, friendly and quick.  Ordered cheese omelette and it was fantastic.  Next time I'm in town I'll be there."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time. Yuck is the word that comes to mind. The bright side to our meal was the server. She was friendly and efficient. Chompies might be good for other foods we opted for the burgers because we thought the other food was a bit spendy . The menu was a bit pricey for deli sandwiches (approx $14-$16). Example: a pastrami sandwich with fries costs 16.99! We ordered the original burger which tasted and had the consistency of a turkey burger. The manager said it was not a turkey burgers and was rude. The meat was gray!! Ewww! We couldn't eat the burgers and will not return. For New York deli sandwiches we will continue to go to miracle mile deli."}
{"text":"Chompie's is literally the best food ever. Nothing tops it. Favorite restaurant by far."}
{"text":"I really love coming to this Chompies for their service and convience. I found their chicken noodle soup to be the closest thing to grandma's on the market.  Huge veggies,  lots of chicken,  noodles with flavor.  But today I found my newest favorite item,  the Everything Bagel. OHMYWORD, it's so delicious.  Just toasted,  with the hint of butter,  I wanted a dozen. I just got one,  but if I could've possibly eaten 11 more,  that's what I would have purchased!!"}
{"text":"The only good meals I've had here are breakfast omelettes and sandwiches the rubens for lunch . I would not recommend any  entrees especially the chicken fried steak thing was really bad. It's surprising that a Jewish style restaurant can't make tasty potato pancakes.  It was thick and tasteless. Stay away from the broccoli which was over cooked and also tasteless."}
{"text":"Finding a place that offers a \"selection\" of gluten free options can be difficult.  Some just consider \"it comes without bread\" as qualifying as gluten free.  Chompie's delivers on options that fulfill that longing for gluten foods that are usually off limits.  I haven't had waffles in years but this morning I enjoyed four petite Belgium waffles with turkey sausage and OE eggs.  My husband had a massive French omelet that will suffice for lunch later. :) We had a long wait but considering it was a holiday (Father's Day) this was to be expected.  The wait for a table was in line with what the hostess told us.  The waiter was upfront that the day was very busy but had coffee and juice to us in a few minutes.  Our meal was delivered in a reasonable time.  Will definitely be back for lunch and dinner.  Our waiter was very personable and made the experience all that much better. 

Service:  five stars
Staff interaction: five stars, honest and upfront about wait times
Wait: four stars (only because it was a holiday)"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Chompies breakfast menu. I suggest arriving early to avoid long lines. If you do sleep in and get there after 10 on a weekend, the long wait will be worth it. If breakfast is not your thing then go for the deli sandwiches and bring a friend to help you lift and eat the huge stacks of meat. I like the Motown and get it slightly grilled. The matzo ball soup is the best remedy for a cold. No kidding...order it (with the chicken), have a cup of tea, go home take a nap. You will be healed.  Visit the bakery counter before you leave."}
{"text":"service is slow.the  rye was great but the meat of the sandwich was made with scraps off the slicer.,no full slices of pastrami"}
{"text":"A great menu selection and large portions!  The staff are friendly and the service is very quick.  The deli area also has a wide variety of fresh and baked items."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now - and really its a great deli style restaurant if you are missing the NY jewish deli fare. The pastrami is delicious. The latkes and smoked nova...load me up.

It's always pretty busy and you know why.
The service is ALWAYS very friendly, and somehow we always end up with a great waiter or waitress that gives us cookies for our kids just because.

The portions are substantial, so you won't go home hungry and really there are a million options on the menu. Just like a NJ/NY diner.

Its a great place to just sit and enjoy comfort food."}
{"text":"If you're hungry this is the place for you good food & huge portions, we can always count on leftovers! Just had their cragel (sp?) breakfast sandwich & WOW!!! The bread is a combo of a croissant & bagel, a MUST try!! I love their breakfast tacos too!"}
{"text":"We go to Chompies almost ever Saturday. Today we walked in, they sat three couples ahead of us. We asked for a booth. We were the only people waiting, sat for 15 minutes and looked to see the five booths open and available. We walked out and never going there again."}
{"text":"We don't live here so are in only occasionally. A friend told us of new ownership but assured me it hadn't changed a thing.  It feels different to me. We bought cookies for a party yesterday. Although three people were behind the baked goods counter, apparently only one was authorized to wait on customers with a second charged with telling us (the only customers waiting) that we would be helped soon. The third might have only had responsibilities at the other end of the counter but was watching the person helping customers ring up an order. $1.95 per cookie for a 4 inch star shaped sugar cookie frosted and with sprinkles seems high but people at the party liked them. Today we went for breakfast. There was a brief wait to be seated by a pleasant, professional hostess. We waited almost as long to meet our waitress though an uncommunicative busboy provided silverware and napkins but not water in the meantime. There was a very long wait for the food to come out of the kitchen. I should have timed it... At least 20 minutes, maybe longer. It was about 11a.m. on a Sunday.  The orders were correct though my omelette was not well put together. Our waitress checked back immediately but didn't refill our water until she had presented our check.  $27 seemed high for a breakfast for two but my wife did add a bagel to her breakfast not realizing it wasn't included."}
{"text":"We use to go to the location on Greenway but now have tried other locations...not as big a fan as in the past...but we would still frequent the place just not as often."}
{"text":"Love Chompies a New York deli in Phoenix. Their bagels are the best, get the Cragel and the veggie cream cheese you can't go wrong. They have an extensive menu and especially for Breakfast. Been going to breakfast for years and while my tastes have changed I am always able to find something. Their Bobka french toast is so good but so sweet, so no longer something I can eat but I do think about it. If you want lunch get one of their pastrami sandwiches, their challah roll is the best. All in all a great place to watt, go try it."}
{"text":"Basically, right across the street from ASU in Tempe, AZ.  This is an awesome jewish style deli with delicious food and pastries.  I have heard that breakfast here is amazing but I have only been here for lunch.  The burger and slider's were fantastic and if you order a deli sandwich, it is piled HIGH with meat just as you would expect.  

Great service and friendly people here.  The best deli experience you can get in this part of the world.  This place was also featured on Man Vs. Food with Adam Richman.  Great food and fun times...  I recommend!"}
{"text":"In my quest to find the best pastrami-on-rye in the Valley, Chompie's is a natural choice as it's probably the most famous -- if not the oldest -- Jewish deli around.  I ordered my usual sampling of a full sandwich with mustard and cole slaw, this time to go.  Would you believe me when I tell you that the price displayed on the cash register was ... wait for it ... $14.15?  Seriously.

\"Uhm,\" said I, \"let's go with a half instead.\"  This approached $9.00.  

But this was the tastiest of the four places I've thus far sampled.  Although I very much appreciated the \"clean\" taste of the nicely lean meat at Goldman's, Chompie's pastrami is warm and fatty and served on the best rye yet.  Yum.  And the bread actually tastes like rye, not white bread with caraway seeds. And it holds together nicely.  The crust is actually crusty with a cornmeal crunch.

Although lacking in flavor distinction, the pickle was nonetheless \"bright\" - obviously freshly made.

Well played, Chompie's.  After I finish my pastrami sandwich survey, I MIGHT be back.  But I just can't see awarding four stars for an almost $15 sandwich, nice as it is."}
{"text":"Chompie's is a busy busy place. A 20-minute wait for table is not unusual. Although it is not my favorite New York deli (outside NYC of course), it is not too far off. Food is generous in portion, and tastes homemade. Everyone can find something they like from the very large menu selections. The baked goods are stacked near the entrance, and you can get old bagels for cheap. The dessert counter has some inviting items, like cannolis, but those are very pricey. Overall, if I want a hearty brunch with friends and don't mind the wait, Chompie's is on my list."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant!!! Our service was lousy, the place was filthy and our food was terrible...not to mention my husband and I both got sick from what we ate!!! Never going here again and I will be contacting the restaurant tomorrow to get a refund!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!!!  Nothing like fresh food that's GOOD!!!

I slid into home and I'm SAFE! At Chompie's"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Chompies this Sunday at noon for our yearly visit before we return to Wisconsin for the Summer months. We each had a half sandwich and a soup. We were not happy with the Pastrami this time. I told the server that it was very tough. She did not seem too concerned, but later did say she would tell someone in the kitchen. I had to chew each bite at least ten times - really?  The floor in the dining room was littered with paper and bits of food. As we walked out past the kitchen we noticed the floor was very dirty with scraps of food all over. Not impressive at all."}
{"text":"Got a full pastrami sandwich for $16. It tastes good and has a lot of meat. You just don't get much food for the money. Go somewhere else and get the same amount of food for 1/2 the cost."}
{"text":"Chompie's Cheddar Cheese Bagels...mmmmmmmm CHEESE!

Incredible menu offerings, authentic NY style Jewish deli and bakery.

Did I say the Cheddar Cheese Bagel toasted with chive cream cheese is about the best bagel under the sun?  Well trust me it is!

If Homer Simpson ever tried a Chompie's Cheddar Cheese Bagel he'd never eat another damn pink doughnut...ever!"}
{"text":"Terrible night at this location.  Ordered salami and eggs with a request to have the eggs cooked well.  They came out cold and runny.  Our server displayed such a negative attitude.  Also never had our water refilled or any inquiry if we needed anything else.  Very much felt we were an intrusion.  It seems like they are at the stage where they are living on reputation - not ensuring that the paying Customer is having a good (doesn't even have to be great!) experience.  You lost 2x month visit x $45 average bill per visit = $990 plus NOT recommending anymore to a friend."}
{"text":"I came up here with my parents and friends for a birthday dinner.  As always the food is excellent at all of their locations I've visited.  I love this spot because it is big, clean and the service was great.  I had one of their mile high corned beef sandwiches and it was killer.  We came on a Tuesday night and while it was busy, there was no wait to be seated or getting your food & drinks.  My 2 favorite delis in the country are Chompie's here in Phoenix and Jerry's Deli in L.A.  If you are in town, you have to stop in.  You won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Great bagels, amazing pickles, and decent prices. The staff here is always friendly. The bakery has a huge selection for treats to take home. I love Chompies for breakfast. Try one of their eggs Benedict plates. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just average deli food rye bread was not great pickles were fair side of potato salad was so small it was a joke prices high overall just fair!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. I don't get to Phoenix a lot but I was in heaven with the GIANT menu including an all-day breakfast selection. There's so much here I want to try, from fish to skillets and burgers. I settled on a Corned Beef and Cabbage with two sides. My dad got sweet and sour cabbage rolls. While we waited they brought us pickles to knosh on. When my corned beef plate arrived, I was stunned by the quantity. There is a LOT of food on there plates! The cabbage was never ending and soft and delicious, the beef was not fat or greasy and there was just a ton of it, seriously, felt never-ending. My sides include GIANT broccoli and lots of it- steamed and fosh, and a potato pancake with dipping sauces. 
The food was almost too much- I couldn't finish the broccoli as I was just too full. My dad's delicious sweet cabbage was plentiful and he could not finish his garden salad side.

We were unable to make room for the various cookies and desserts and baked goods available, which means I will have to return to a Chompie's Deli soon!"}
{"text":"Man the chompie sliders is the bomb.  Wish there were some in LA.  Man taste so good and flavor."}
{"text":"We returned the Black & White cookies today, 09/20/2016, to Chompie's. We spoke with the Manager of that Cookie Department, Zach. He was sorry to hear we had a problem as he explained how they handle their products. My issue centered around the rotated stock since I \"asked are they fresh\" first. Zach gave us new fresh cookies, so as far as  I'm concerned he took care of my issue. :OLD REVIEW: The large Black & White cookies were NOT fresh today 9/14/2016. I asked before purchase if these were fresh today, soft insides--Yes they were just put out. They rotated stock and I got the old ones. Fresh black & white cookies are soft, The ones I was given were very firm when cut open at my house--not soft or fresh. I'll be back in their location next week and will raise the issue of lying about product's freshness. I'll update on the outcome."}
{"text":"I love this place, I try to go whenever I can! They have a HUGE menu with a wide variety of dishes to choose from. They are very generous with how much meat they put in their Sandwiches! Which I love. This is the real deal. It's a real deli with freshly made food for your tastebuds! If you ever have the chance, you have to stop in at this place. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is a Man vs. Food stop, so I had the man vs. food menu item and the special bread it was on was dry, the meet was good but the latka was tasteless.  I would say this place is just OK."}
{"text":"Today I was craving a sandwich but didn't want to go to the typical Subway or Togo's so I decided to check this place out because it is close to my apartment and I had heard good things. Here are my pros:

Ample parking- the lot is huge and I'd be surprised if it ever filled up.

Friendly employees- she may have been a little bit lost but she was super sweet.

Large sandwiches- I was unaware of what I was in for, so I added salami to my turkey sandwich. Needless to say the sandwich ended up being HUGE. I literally had to deconstruct it to eat it.

Fresh produce and tasty meat- the produce on my sandwich was delicious and crisp. The meat was flavorful and as I mentioned there was a lot of it.

Pickles- The dill pickles I received with my order were scrumptious. I could see why someone would say they are salty but I LOVE salt so it was yummy.

Bread- the bread was delicious. I may have to go back and buy some of their sourdough bread to make sandwiches at home.

Cons:

Price- it was a wee bit more expensive than I was expecting. Its like $8 for a small sandwich and $10 for a large. I also wasn't sure I was charged correctly because the girl taking my order didn't seem to know what she was doing.

I still would like to go back and try their breakfast items, which I heard are fabulous and also to buy the \"half moon\" cookies they have. (If you are from upstate New York you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about). Oh and I want to try the Ultimate Slider Challenge one of these days."}
{"text":"The service took forever, when we walked the hostess didn't even told us we were supposed to put our names in, she just standed there and stared. It was until a few parties after they their name in that's when we knew what we were supposed to do. It was extremely rude, fired her or re train her (her name is Faith) if you want more customer coming back. The food is good and our waitress was friendly, would only come back for the food."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everytime I am in town it's on my list! I love the challah French toast, pancakes and the amazing desserts!"}
{"text":"First of all three stars is an insult for the quality of food and service delivered at this deli.
We've been searching for a NYC deli, west of the Mississippi, for years. We travel to NY just to get our deli fix.
Inhaled the half Reuben w/chicken noodle soup and matzo ball. The flavor and quality of everything was awesome.
Service was attentive and very courteous.
Can't wait to go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Loved the sampler of different pickles.

The decor was fun.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly, explaining to us the menu our first time there.  

We had the reuben sandwich and the sliders.  Both were delicious.

We didn't have any space left for dessert, but we did pick up some pastries for the drive home."}
{"text":"Good food in general, however hit-or-miss with sandwich quality. Prices are out of line - after living next door for years they've fallen into the category of \"we'll charge a high premium because we want to be a premium brand\" without escalating food quality and portion sizes as well. Better food can be had around Tempe for 1/3 or 1/2 the price."}
{"text":"Soooo delicious, the portions are huge and the price e-z.. The beef brisket seasoned just right,spinach and garlic Yum.. Whoever the cook is as of 3/16/16 wonderful tasty tasty"}
{"text":"Fantastic all the way around!

Now granted, we came as guests for a Yelp Elite event. So full disclosure, they were probably at their best. That being said, they went above and beyond to show us just how delicious their food was, and how accommodating and friendly they were. I was able to sample three of their sliders, and have to say the corned beef as to die for. All their deserts and cookies were excellent. But what stood out the most for me was the bagels. I'm not a big bagel person myself but their strawberry bagels are one of the best things I've had the pleasure of devouring. I could pretty much eat those for 1000 years. 

Highly recommend this place if you want some great comfort deli food. :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Wow!! There breakfast and brunch oh boy!!! Best place in Arizona my preference I lthis place"}
{"text":"Wow!! Chompies is amazing I started out thinking that this place was just some diner but boy was I wrong this place is absolutely  amazing!!!! The food was great the service  was awesome and to be frank it's all around good"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the food definitely keeps me coming back. One of my favorite choices is the Jewish sliders they are served on a soft roll with a thick potato pancake and juicy sliced beef then topped with cheese a a drizzle of gravy. Beware though these bad boys pack a punch in your stomach you get three to an order and I am lucky if I can eat one and half. They are super filling and be sure to upgrade to the fried onion strings and you wont regret. John likes the corned beef and pastrami sandwich (not really for my tastes). They always give you a generous portion of meat that you can barely taste the bread itself lol. Overall I think this is a great lunch spot and the service is always great."}
{"text":"I am slacking on my reviews.  We've been here probably 40 times in the past 4 years.  What's up with not giving them some Yelp love?  

I think 37 of those times were for breakfast and we have worked our way through most of the breakfast menu.  Love the huge omelets and fried potatoes that come on the side.  Never had a bad meal here.

Most recently Mr. M and I had had a very long day of work and house hunting and were exhausted.  I suggested Chompie's because I was craving some soup.  I had the matzo ball soup and he had the clam chowder.  Both were delicious and we were passing those bowls back and forth.  I ended up keeping the chowder and taking a large bowl of it home for Saturday.  They only have the chowder on Fridays, but they have 5 or 6 other kinds of soup every day.  

I also had the Jewish sliders and he had a half sandwich with hard salami and Havarti on sourdough.  I can't even type hard salami without getting the giggles, let alone say it.  Their famous sliders were excellent as always and Mr. M's sandwich accompanied the soup perfectly.  

The bakery counter is amazing and full of all kinds of goodies.  I try not to look at it when I'm in there or I will get sucked in.  

Only once out of all the times we've been here have we had bad service and that was an older broad working the bakery counter who was ignoring everyone so she could chat with her friend about how things used to be in New York.  blah blah blah.  She needed a reminder that she was at work, BUT I haven't seen her in a long, long time so maybe she moved back East.  Usually the employees are very friendly and efficient.  I would say Chompie's is my #1 breakfast choice and then the Biscuits on Dobson.  Excellent food every time!"}
{"text":"Went there after seeing Man Vs Food. The sliders were wonderful. Most of the sanwiches were in the $12 range. The server was quick and attentive. We will definately be back!"}
{"text":"So glad you opened  next to the Chandler Fashion Mall. I go to the movies around the corner and always stop by Chompie's before or after. Of course it does cut into my popcorn money, but a far better value. 

I love the Matzo Ball Soup. I have tried most everything but the one thing that stands out high on my list is the mile high sandwiches. The hot pastrami is great. I love love love the coleslaw and pickles. 

Chompie's is the best deli around. I love that they have special dinners for those special holidays of the Jewish faith. \"Metzuyan\""}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Came here awhile go and ordered a sandwich, I added turkey to it and they charged me $4 extra dollars for the turkey. Sandwich was okay, nothing special. Thought I would give it another shot and try something else today. Went there on my break and got a kids meal, which took almost 20 minutes for my to-go order. After I got back to my work to eat it, I had 5 minutes left to eat it. I could hear the employees in the back messing around and laughing, obviously not doing their job. My chicken strips ended up being soggy. Overpriced and workers are the opposite of hard working. Won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Hot Pepper Jack Cheese Omelet, Sesame seed bagel, coffee and HILARIOUS conversation with good buddy, Bob Williams...LET THE WEEKEND BEGIN !!"}
{"text":"LOVE the matzo ball soup and brisket sliders!  The bakery is extensive."}
{"text":"I have grabbed bagels and cream cheese many times from this location and been perfectly satisfied. Today was the first time I sat down in the restaurant and had a meal. It was just under average. I had the eggs Benedict with chorizo and avocado. Everything was just bit mushy. No real flavor to it. I probably would have given 3-4 stars if the service would have been outstanding,  but that was probably the biggest letdown. My server forgot my original drink order and had to come back and ask again. She only checked in once and asked if I needed a refill on my soda. I did, but I had diet and she brought me back regular. For the price, not what I expected."}
{"text":"So, there's no negative stars, too bad. Tried ordering take out before actually eating there to try it - good thing, you couldn't pay me to eat here.

The only thing about the Colossal Cobb salad I ordered was the price. $10 and change for lettuce just enough to cover the bottom of the styrofoam with a sprinkle of toppings. Where'd they get their chef, Chili's? What a disappointment. All the reviews say ' a lot of food' ...for who, an infant?

I had also ordered a couple of carmelized cookies as well. Didn't know deep fried, greasy discs of oatmeal harder than concrete were called 'cookies'. Good grief, the bakery wasn't even good! Had to spit those things out before they took out a filling. 

The only good thing about Chandler Chompie's is Jason's Deli right next door."}
{"text":"Service was great but the Friday fish fry was horrible. Over battered and over deep fried best describes it. The fish, once I got down to it, tasted fresh and tasty, just getting to the fish was a task in itself. The wife had home fries and chocolate chip pancakes and both were awesome. Again the service was great and the cannolis to go were great as well."}
{"text":"Great food and the service was awesome. They forgot about our order, but comped our whole check.  The food was worth the wait! We are def coming back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a fast breakfast to go. Service was very friendly and very fast! Blueberry bagel was very good and the strawberry almond cream cheese is a must!"}
{"text":"I had the Dave's Deli Benedict and I must say it was AMAZING!  Portion size is huge!  Corned beef has was delicious!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good food.  A bit high in price but when you're craving a good ruben where are you going to go?"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, good food!

The server was very prompt and helpful in pointing out some gluten free vegan menus items I would be able to eat. Since I have food allergies- this was pretty important. 

Our food arrived promptly and our cups were never empty and the food was perfect. I ordered a modified skillet dish and it arrived with perfectly sautéed veggies and no excess oil. Yum!

Definitely recommend giving this place a go."}
{"text":"This is the first and last time I think I will eat at Chompies...the food was phenomenal, the service was exceptional and the restaurant was clean.  The prices however were RIDICULOUS!!!  We had stuffed cabbage, pancakes and a sandwich and the bill came to $56 ??  We paid $17 for a turkey sandwich...no turkey sandwich on the planet is worth $17 !!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Chompie's since I was a kid. I think this location was originally on 32nd St & Shea, then moved to 32nd St and Greenway, and finally moved here. Edward was our server today and did a great job keeping the iced teas flowing and the food coming."}
{"text":"First time at Chompie's. NY deli in Tempe: Who'd have thought? I arrived at 12:30 on a Tuesday afternoon and it was during graduation, so it was packed. Regardless, I was seated within five mins. My server checked on me right away, took my drink order and brought me ice water. 

I ordered the Soup and Jewish Slider Combo, with Chicken Noodle and Matso Ball soup plus corned beef sliders. 

The menu was huge, with plenty of breakfast, brunch and lunch items. 

My meal arrived in 12 mins. My server, Jessica, took good care of her whole section, despite the crowd. 

The soup was light, full of tender-crisp veggies and a big matzo ball. It had plenty of chicken and noodles. 

The two sliders were outstanding, with fresh but firm challah bread, roast beef, jack cheese, a potato pancake and horseradish spread. It also came with a side of rich brown Gravy for dipping and 1/4 cup slaw. 

The meal came to $16.09 plus tip."}
{"text":"Had the Jewish sliders. These were good, but they fall under the category \"food that makes you feel fat\". You get a lot of food for your money here, so keep that in mind while ordering. My first time here I ordered waaay too much food."}
{"text":"I don't get to come here all the time, but it's a treat when I do.  Sadly my stomach can't handle whatever oil is used for the eggs, but that doesn't mean I can't get a French toast! And they have such amazing French toast, they use Challah bread for it!  I love the bread by itself anyway, so adding syrup to it and egg frying it makes it amazing.  

They have a wonderful deli as well, I wish I could just go through all the amazing pastries and sweets there.

I have unfortunately I think irritated the staff before because once I couldn't tip be said I only had a gift card, and there have been times where I couldn't tip with anything other than change.  But as long as you are pleasant and do right over time, they welcome you with open arms."}
{"text":"Chompies is a favorite restaurant to take visitors, meet friends and have a leisurely breakfast with my hubby.  Upon arrival,  Beatriz,  the long standing greeter, remembered me, said hello to all of us in her friendly manner and immediately sat us.  
We were fortunate to have the owner Lovie welcome us and she engaged in conversation  with my family from California. She was gracious and obviously loves her business.
We ordered breakfasts and sipped on ice tea and  Bloody Mary drinks.  
This would have been a 5 star experience except for my order.  The other two breakfasts came and were delicious omelettes, bagels and potatoes.  However, my omelette did not come out.  I waited  10 minutes to flag our waitress because she never came over to check on us.  She quickly apologized and said she misunderstood my order.  It took another 15 minutes to receive my Baja omelette.  Instead of potatoes I ordered fruit.  I did not get fruit and the waitress had to be flagged again for fruit.  My fellow diners were done well before I started my omelette.  The waitress comped 20% off of my meal which amounted t0 $2,  which seemed relatively insufficient for the error.  My omelette was delicious and I ate half of it.  
The omelettes are amazingly flavorful and packed with fresh produce or corned beef hash, depending  on the choice.  The portions can easily be shared and definitely brought home for another meal.
Thank you Beatriz and Lovie for making Chompies a joyful place."}
{"text":"Chompie's is an Arizona staple and huge with the ASU community as most of their servers, decorations and customers are either ASU students or parents of. That being said, Chompie's is known and loved by AZ natives. I'm not a native, or an ASU student, I just came here for good food and I hate to say, I wasn't particularly impressed.

The place is very much diner style: casual, overly decorated and giant portions. I got a greek skillet with the traditional fried egg, potatoes, veggies and feta cheese (to actually make it \"greek\"). The skillet was quite large and exploding with ingredients, but there was really nothing special to the food itself. After I drowned it in hot sauce it became a little less bland, but I only managed to eat half of it before I lost interest. There really wasn't anything particularly special: the components tasted pre-made and assembled. The prices were very manageable for the size of the meal and our ASU-student-server was pretty nice. I don't doubt that this is a traditional and 'regular' spot for many people in the valley, I just wanted more out of my breakfast."}
{"text":"Food was bland, although you get HUGE portions. Very expansive menu with may choices for breakfast (served all day) lunch and dinner.  The waitresses were all very nice and they have a nice are for outdoor seating. This restaurant was also kid friendly and accommodated our group of mom's and young children well."}
{"text":"This place is a great lunch spot! I usually don't like sandwiches but these sliders are so yummy! Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Very good food.. extensive menu.. lots of baked goods.. New York Jewish type deli but other southwestern and unique dishes on the menu.. Guanajuato huevos are fantastic"}
{"text":"What an amazing dining discovery, miss New York a little less tonight. The Jewish sliders are to die for, everyone needs to try fried matzoh with chipotle ranch, and the service by Judi was totally as wonderful as the food."}
{"text":"I normally enjoy coming here for the low prices breakfast specials during the week. For the most part, the food is decent and the service is good. 

Unfortunately, my visit today was less than impressive and I don't see myself returning soon. I ordered the French toast and it arrived half an hour later. It tasted fine until I got to a couple of pieces that were very undercooked and cold. This, in addition to the slow service when the restaurant was almost empty, left me not wanting to come back."}
{"text":"Their bagels are super delicious, along with their desserts(mainly the coffee cake). Other than that the rest of the food is pretty bland. I always get the lox bagel on the cheddar jalapeño bagel and omg it is the best lox bagel I have ever had. I drive 15 mins just to go get their lox bagel and every minute is worth it because it really is delicious!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times and three times I got the Jewish sliders.  You really just can't go wrong with them :)  The only downside is because it's right on ASU campus, this place is PACKED basically at all times during the weekend but it's SOOOO worth the wait."}
{"text":"If only their coffee was as good as their food'  however their chopped liver is always excellent.  They also have the best hot pastrami west of the Hudson River. Yea - they make a darned good Ruben too. Great Delli eating right here in Scottsdalr

Yummy. A breakfast egg sandwich on one of their great beagles. One of the best breakfast deals in 

I highly recommend the breakfast geek sandwich with corned beef hash and cheddar cheese"}
{"text":"Place seems to keep going downhill. Pastrami was fatty and gristly and portions were not what they should be for a $16 sandwich. Chicken in a pot was not properly prepared and the whole experience was a disappointment."}
{"text":"When I moved away from Phoenix for 11 years, one of the places I dreamed about was Chompie's!  I have yet to have a bad meal here, nor have I ever left hungry.  The portion sizes are huge--even the sandwiches--so keep that in mind wen ordering.  My personal favorite is the Leo, which is an enormous salmon and egg scramble that comes with hash browns and a toasted bagel.  It's hearty and delicious.  My partner swears by the matzah ball soup, which has been rumored to cure ennui and promote a holistic restoration of spirit in even the most cynical of constitutions. If you're in the mood for something traditional, try the smoked whitefish salad.  Or you could ask for the salad sampler (which is not on the menu anymore, but may still be available.)  You get enough tuna, chicken and egg salad to feed two people -- especially if you order one of the bread baskets.  

We rarely have enough room in our stomachs for desserts, so we get those to go.  After three, pastries and breads can be had for half price, along with various cream cheese spreads, so there's no excuse for skipping breakfast the next day.   The decor at the PV location is modernized from the old location on 32nd Street, but still charming and fun.  Bring your appetite--you'll need it."}
{"text":"I have only been to Chompies once.  The waitress recommended sharing a corned (spelled right, I guess) beef sandwich which she said would be big enough for two.  She wasn't kidding.  What truly impressed me was the beef.  It was not to salty and no pieces that you had to hod your napkin up and spit out.  Those are the reasons I never have this kind of sandwich.  Just great beef with the right kind of condiments in my opinion.  When we got the bill I was holding my breath.  What would it cost when the beef was in my opinion excellent.  My surprise at how reasonable the cost was.  Now I have to make a point of getting back there.  I like good potato pancakes.  If they are as good as what I had today, I'll be one happy camper!"}
{"text":"I love Chompie's! Everything I have ever gotten off this massive menu has been delicious! I went to school at ASU and loved going to the Tempe location and now always make sure to make a stop when I am back in AZ, usually this Scottsdale location. 

I would specifically recommend anything with pastrami (sandwich, eggs, etc). The bagels are very good here too."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Always hard to decide what to order because there are so many options. Edward was our server and he was great!"}
{"text":"I actually work right by this location, they have went above & beyond to please our staff. They deliver up to us a bucket of bagels fairly often with our 3 favorite cream cheeses. Always a crowd there but they are efficient & willing to please."}
{"text":"Great deli a lot of choices. The menu is huge!!! Sandwiches are amazing and staff was friendly and helpful with the giant menu. Soups were great. Some are the sandwiches are 3 meats high and you will not finish it. Great for big groups and parties. So many dessert and deli meats to go. $$-$$$"}
{"text":"I liked a lot about the place. For the appetizer, we had the smoked salmon appetizer with capers on a potato pancake- SO good! For my actual meal I had a brisket sandwich. it was a bit dry since they do not put any sauce n it and the protein bread is pretty spongy-and my boyfriend ordered a sandwich with pulled pork, potato pancakes and gravy- MUY delicious. Service was great and fast, my coffee was kept filled and the waitress even went through the extra effort of finding out how many carbs were in the low carb bread. This is a huge plus for those living a healthy low carb or fitness lifestyle. You can get any breakfast with cottage cheese or low carb bread as a sub for toast and it just made me so happy! 

Some other cool points about this place, it's like a legit New York themed and style deli. You can get fresh bagels and bread here ( all of it is effing delicious), fresh deli sandwiches like brisket, roast beef etc. The portions are good, and price works with my wallet. It wasn't too busy on a Sunday morning which is a plus, because when you are hungover, or just starving on a Sunday morning, you don;t want to wait forever to sit and get your grub on. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Their back on my 5-star list. Thanks Teresa for reaching out to me about my past experience last week. Today was fabulous: sweet n sour cabbage soup & turkey pastrami sandwich hit the spot. Great hustle & bustle at Shea location. Thanks for the great service today & delish food."}
{"text":"my fiance and I absolutely love Chompie's Deli .... this one is not nearly as busy as the location in Tempe, which is definitely nice.  This one, instead of the 18-22 year old clientele, is definitely the senior citizen location :) They still have a deli, take-out, and sit-down options, along with a full bar :) I cannot go without getting the Jewish sliders ... they are just too good!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant by far in Phoenix is Chompie's Restaurant. Every time I go into the restaurant, they have a friendly atmosphere, great service and terrific food. The wait staff know the large menu well and make good recommendations on a variety of foods that are offered. The deli is stocked with fresh traditional meats and cheeses. There are Jewish deli favorites like hot brisket of beef and pastrami, sliced to order. *knishes, pirogies, potato pancakes, etc. The bakery offers desserts and pastries like cheesecake, carrots cake, red velvet, German Chocolate cake, Tiramisu and, my personal favorite Cannoli's. There are many varieties of breads and bagels to choose from, lo carb and gluten free as well. In the restaurant they have fresh mile high sandwiches and homemade matzo ball soup, and my 2 personal favorites the homemade corned beef hash and their incredible Jewish Sliders. They have a little something for everyone from southwestern style items to ones that offer something for the health conscience patrons. Chompie's is an Arizona treasure, with its fresh deli sandwiches and fresh bakes breads and pastries. If you're ever nearby stop in for a bite to eat and treat yourself to one of the best meals you'll ever have."}
{"text":"Only things to order: Jewish Sliders & Matzah Ball Soup

Seriously, the other stuff on the menu is just decent...the two items above are what we one for."}
{"text":"Popped in for take-out because the brothers wanted to try Chompie's Jewish sliders.  It was all Adam Richman's fault.  But when you hear it's a fresh-baked-from-scratch mini challah roll filled with moist lean beef brisket, real Jack cheese and a homemade potato pancake (latke) with a savory brown gravy on the side, you just want to try it.  Unfortunately, it was just okay.  

The matzoh ball soup wasn't bad but my black & white cookie was dry.  Pleh.  Plus service was deplorable."}
{"text":"Lovely food. Fresh bagel and veggie cream what I loved. Good presentation on the food plate and taste wise too no complaints.
Felt a bit little pricey but can go for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I love Chompies! If you're from NY, and enjoy Jewish food-- plus, this is the place for you! Great bakery, deli and place to eat. Bagels are NOT NY quality at all though, so dont bother buying."}
{"text":"FROM BROOKLYN NEW YORK, MONTICELLO  NY AND NEW JERSEY. Have eaten the best authentic bagels on this planet. No one in Arizona makes bagels, or bialys or seeded rye bread even close to the recipes at chompies. That includes their cakes and cookies. The Scottsdale location has the best bakery hands down in Arizona. Old school European type baking spot on to the 50's and 60's imigrants that came from Europe and started these recipes..fresh brisket sliders with potatoe pancakes on a bun are to die for. The Jewish version of White Castle..Scotsdale only large BOBKA cake is the real things. Pastrami sandwiches excellent though not the best ever. Missing authentic old style deli mustard unfortunately. If you want authentic Jewish style look no further unless you want to waste your time. There is no authentic better bagels hands down anywhere in ARIZONA AND I MEAN ANYWHERE.. This place is the real deal and will bring back New York memories of the best food you have ever eaten to this day. Costs a bit more but you get what you pay for in taste and wuality"}
{"text":"I ordered the monte cristo sandwich and it was tasty! The portions are huge and I couldn't even eat half of my meal. My husband had the buffalo chicken sandwich and he said it had the perfect amount of heat. Our friend had the roast beef sandwich and he said it was delicious. Oddly his sandwich came with no sides which caught him off guard. What sandwich doesn't at least come with fries??? It was just the sandwich on his plate. I had more than enough fries with my sandwich so I was happy to share. We also ordered an appetizer of potato pancakes which were cooked perfectly. Unfortunately the waitress forgot to put on the order so they came out after our meals were served. The pickles they give everyone are also delicious. $15.00 seems little high for a sandwich but it ended up making two meals so I felt it was worth it. Dinner for three ran us just over $60.00. We also picked up a chocolate horn on the way out from the bakery which was yummy."}
{"text":"This is one of those places, you get EXACTLY what you order. No frills, but the service is always awesome ( Arthur is probably one of the most friendly servers I have ever had) and they have bread that's low carb!
The only problem I have with Chompie's is that the menu is so big, it's always mind boggling to figure out what you want to eat. The portions are big, their cream cheeses are all delish ( I particularly love the lox and the chive).
Their potato latkas are hard to pass up. They are a jewish style potato pancake.  Their mile high sandwiches are HUGE. The meat is just piled up and fresh and you really can;t go wrong. I've also enjoyed their GIGANTIC salads ( with a leftover serving or 2 for home), The Cobb salad is definitely my favorite. It's enough for 2-3 meals and costs about $11.

I gotta say eating low carb, this is one of the best restaurants that is reasonable priced with several options. Sure, it's hard to ignore the delicious smells of fresh bagels wafting around, and the awesome dessert display when you walk in, but if you can make it past that, you will have hot coffee refilled promptly, or order a nice bloody mary and enjoy some simple, large portions of food.

Bon apetit!"}
{"text":"I was in the area a few of days later, so I stopped by Chompie's. I arrived at 11:20 on a Wednesday and it was 1/3 full. I got the daily special: Pastrami Bagel Melt, which came with Cole Slaw and a free iced tea. 

Sadly, I saw a family leave without ordering cuz they waited so long for service. My server greeted me right away. 

My lunch arrived in seven mins. I guess pickles are a big thing cuz each party received a tray of dill spears. I never liked them so they went ignored. My bagel sandwich was served open faced on an 'everything' bagel. 

There was plenty of meat on the sandwich, along with melted cheese and a hint of mustard (more at the table). The flavors were all there but it was a very difficult sandwich to eat. Even open-faced with a knife and fork, it kept falling apart. I think the bagel was over grilled. I'll try a different dish next time."}
{"text":"Let's start with the food..

It's okay compared to the real NY style.
Bagels are a sad comparison to the NY bagel.
Sliders are great.
Corned beef is mediocre.

Service..

SUCKS!
Every time I go in, I'm waiting atleast 10 min for a bagel with cream cheese!!

Work on your customer service skills employees! Learn how to multitask!"}
{"text":"So we have had our last trip to Chompies. Prices have become ridiculous for the quantity AND QUALITY of the food. And if you are vegetarian, dont go here unless you want snack like portions. Orange juice today tasted stale and watered down. Still was charged $5 per glass. I could go on and on but it was our last trip - nostalgia for the good old days of quality, quantity and fair prices kept us returning but no more."}
{"text":"Love the matzo ball soup. Went in today to splurge and get some which by the way is $8.99 for a quart of SOUP. I figured it was worth it since I love it so much. I was highly disappointed. The entire quart was broth with absolutely NO chicken, some noodles at the bottom and so much celery I had to throw it out. Also it's supposed to come with bagel chips, I got 4 broken pieces of plain bagel chips. Last time for me ever. What a rip off. I will be telling my friends about this too"}
{"text":"Our waiter Alex was pleasant a gentleman.  Check on us often and got what went we need.  I got the roast beef and matzo ball soup.  My soup was cold hard that heated up. Was very delicious.  My sandwich was little dry so had gotten mayonnaise on the side did help. The roast beef was excellent.  My wife got the corn-beef sandwich was excellent.  Frys were very good to. My brother got the brisket and was a little dry to.  He had to use ketchup the brisket was excellent.  All in love this place and would come again."}
{"text":"I love me some Chompies! My father is Jewish, so I grew up with Hamentachen cookies, knishes and Matzaball soup and this place is just like grandma made it! Even if you aren't a fan of those thing, they have something for everyone on their menu. And their bagels are amazing! Try their monte cristo sandwich, you will love it."}
{"text":"Usually come here on sundays for breakfast/brunch, as with any other place, expect a wait on sunday morning. Always seated pretty quickly. one word, \"SLIDERS\" YAAAAASSSSS!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were out shopping having a girls day. Decided to stop in and eat lunch. Joe the bartender was so friendly upon arrival and took care of when Kristen the bartender was supposed to be serving us. Kristen was rude and presented us with bill w/o us asking. Joe the manager was very kind and could tell there was an issue and help make our experience by giving dessert. I wanted to rate 1 star based on our experience with Kristen but both Joe's made our experience a good one. Kristen need to learn customer service."}
{"text":"Chompie's is delicious! They serve you a lot of food - and it's quality food, too. I've had a number of their meals and I have never not been satisfied. For dinner, for a small lunch -- this is the place to go if you're at the mall. 

I went here with my family for my 19th birthday and so far it's been one of the best birthday meal I've ever experienced.

The staff is nice, friendly and helpful. 

Their Israeli salad has inspired me to make my own and it's delicious. I'm glad this place exists, to say the least!"}
{"text":"Great anytime of day or evening. Food is homemade and is so yummy. Whether it's a chomped bagel and cream cheese or corned beef hash skillet. Awesome!!  Potato pancakes like gram used to make. Never been disappointed there."}
{"text":"Average. I wish I could give it a 3.5 stars. Okay service: friendly enough but need to be more prompt. Food: acceptable but on the salty side (okay, I know, it's Chompie's)!

Will I be back? Sure, only for the convenience and price."}
{"text":"My job will order catering from Chompie's a few times a year but until I saw this restaurant featured on Man Vs. Food I never thought to visit.  I've been a couple times now and I've enjoyed it both times.  The staff was friendly, the food is good and enjoy the pickles a lot!

While I've had many different items from their menu when they have catered for my work I've only had the Jewish Sliders in their restaurant and I really enjoy them.  The normal serving is too much food for me so I always end up with some left overs for later.  Thankfully they still taste great after spending some time in the fridge."}
{"text":"Our server was very bubbly. That's about the only positive thing about our experience. One omelette came out greasy, the buffalo chicken sandwich was just ok but the real kicker was my meal which came out wrong twice. I'm a vegetarian and ordered the open face egg sandwich- it came out with bacon the first time. The second time it came out, it was not at all what the menu stated- completely different veggies and cheese. After we double checked the menu, we let the server know. We had to ask that she take it off the bill, we saw the manager adjust the bill but he didn't even bother to come and apologize. You mess up a meal twice and feed a vegetarian bacon, the least you could do is send the manager over to personally apologize. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Never a disappointment,  the bagels are always on point,  the lox delicious.  The bakery snacks irresistible,  and the portions very large."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Chompie's.  The breakfast is incredible.  The problem at this location is the service.  It is obviously staffed by ASU students due to the proximity to the college and they seem more intent on chatting than doing their jobs.

The food is great, when you actually get YOUR food and not the order of table next to you.  THREE times a server walked by my table and just dumped a plate of food in front of me,with hardly a glance at me or my companion.  Not a single time was it MY order.

When I did get my order of two eggs, potatoes, bacon, and the customary bagel, it was very good.  My companion could not say as much for his grilled cheese on Challah bread.  It was greasy and mediocre.

I do recommend their bakery though- take home an eclair and you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Tried the Jewish sliders and the corned beef sandwich with coleslaw and potato salad respectively.  The sliders were very delicious.  I would definitely recommend them.  3 came with the order and I took the 3rd home.  The corned beef sandwich was also pretty good, though I can't say I can tell one from being better or worse than another since its pretty much all salty meat.  Tasted about right..  I thought it was supposed to have 1000 island dressing on it though which I didn't taste.  

The salads were both sweeter than typical.  I didn't mind it though.  The potato salad was better I thought, more flavor.  Cole slaw tasted slightly watery.

I can't wait to try some of their baked goods.  They had some streusel sitting out for guests and I tried something with chocolate and another that tasted of cranberry-orange.  The cranberry-orange one was delicious.  I would have gotten some for home if I wasn't so full."}
{"text":"We have been going to the Chompie's on Shea for over two years and really enjoyed the Hometown NY food and atmosphere. It reminded us of all the good things that you would find at Katz's in lower Manhattan. 

Okay, so why the setup for another Chompie's location?  Well the last few times at the Shea location we sat and waited, and waited(15 mins or so) for our waiter to come by and ask us for our drink order. Hey, when you're busy that's to be understood -- but our waiter was on break most of time and the place was half empty.  Also, it seems whenever we asked for anything (pickles, napkins, etc) our waiter seemed fairly indifferent to us.  It happened a few more times on different visits and so we had enough. 

Well, our trek in the desert has been rewarded. This Chompie's (PV Mall) is everything the other one wasn't.  The wait staff came by immediately and ask about our drink order & offered suggestions on different menu items. We were thrilled. We didn't realize there was another Chompie's nearby.  And the food was great (just like the one on Shea)!

From now on we will shlep the extra 10 minutes to the PV Mall location and will try to forget all about the other one over on Shea.  If you're into Katz's and some Catskill theater then you might enjoy the Chompie's on Shea, we didn't!  When the wait staff stand around talking while you're hungry, it's a real mood kill.

So go to Chompie's at the PV Mall and enjoy the food and service and feel free tip generously.  Oh, BTW there's a ton of parking available at PV another difference in their favor.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Chompies never fails to fail. While I never expect a Carnegie or Katz's Deli experience, I would expect the basics like a good corned beef experience to at least be mediocre.   My sandwich yesterday was virtually all fat. What a continuing disappointment."}
{"text":"THis has got to be the BEST breakfast location in Phoenix.  The selection of meals is extensive and there are items, e.g. smoked salmon, that cannot be found anywhere else in the area.  They also make and sell Bagels like the ones I used to get in New York.  Not may establishments get my 5 star rating, but, this one fits in that category, at least for breakfast.  Every item is fresh and service by a well trained staff.  Bring your appetite, you'll need it."}
{"text":"This gets two stars because their bagels are THAT good. Go for the bagels, and avoid basically everything else.

Now the bad:

-Seated at a dirty table
-Tea tasted like sewer water
-Eggs were cooked the wrong style (not what I ordered), and one was so undercooked that the eggwhite ran with the yolk. Not a good sign, didn't eat it.
-Hollandaise was not lemony, rich, or buttery. It was worse than the stuff you make at home out of a packet. It basically tasted like someone made a roux and dyed it yellow.
-General lack of interest in service 

I did report the egg issue as politely as I could to my server, who empathetically said \"Awww,\" and then walked away. 

If you review the glass-enclosed pastry area, you may be surprised to discover that literally everything in the case has been mislabeled- the fun game is trying to figure out what is what! (seriously, that's what we did while waiting for our dirty table.)

I hope I just caught them on a bad day, because it was really, really bad.. but they will still get my bagel custom. These bagels seriously rule."}
{"text":"Went back for the Matzo ball soup when I came down with a head cold and never felt better after eating it! The best I have had in town!"}
{"text":"My mom and I split a salad.  Lots of great chicken, fruit and a yogurt dressing.  We had Sherri's salad. 

You can pretty much get anything there.....The baked goods were dry and cakey.  Other than that it was good."}
{"text":"I had eggs, bacon, and pancakes. The eggs and bacon were amazing but the pancakes were so dry and flavorless. My boyfriend had the exact same thing but his pancakes had chocolate chips and were burnt. The service was good and the place was clean. I like the new York theme because it's unique to the area, but I think the place had too much going on at once. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"I read that this Chompies was going down hill and we experienced this last night. The restaurant was not crowded on Mother's Day which was a sign.
There were lots of employees standing around, picking each other up, chatting, etc. but not doing anything else. Our waiter forgot what my daughter ordered for her drink and ignored my son, who had just arrived and had not ordered yet.
The food took forever to come, it was freezing in the restaurant and my husband needed more coffee but none was offered. We asked for a refill on my daughter's drink and for more coffee. There were only 2 place settings for our party of 4 and we had to ask for more. 
The mashed potatoes were awful. Neither one of my kids ate them.
Two of us had omelets which were good. My son had a latke burger which was really good and my daughter had chicken and Matzo balls (dumplings) which she wasn't impressed with.
One of the reasons we went to Chompies was for the Mother's Day gift of a slice of white cake with raspberry filling. Found out at the end of the meal that it only came with the Mother's Day dinner which was $19.95. Our waiter actually giggled when he said I couldn't have it.
As we were paying he came out with a piece of the cake. Said they had lots of it so it redeemed him a little bit. Overall, a very disappointing outing."}
{"text":"The BBQ salad is tremendous.  Love this place for breakfast and HUGE portions.  Fast paced staff always seems to be helpful enough."}
{"text":"This place is heaven. Especially for people who love sweets! They have good selection of cakes plus the staff are so nice."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend on Christmas night.   She ordered the pastrami sandwich and I ordered the monte Christo,  both of which were delicious.   I highly recommend Chris as a waiter.   He was super accommodating."}
{"text":"Went to Chompies at the Chandler Mall today.  It is the second time I have been to this location.  We were seated right away and went ahead and ordered right after we received our drinks.

We waited for a very long time for our lunch to come.  I ordered a chef salad with the fat free honey mustard dressing.  When I looked in my dressing, there was this lump of something in it.  I poured it onto my bowl and it looked like a long rubbery lugie (sp?) or snotty thing.  I was immediately grossed out and was trying to find our waitress to help me out.  We hadn't seen our waitress in a very long time - we even had to call her over a couple of times for refills.  Well, she never came so then we saw the hostess coming by, so we grabbed her and showed her what was on my plate.  She made this horrible face and said she would take it away.  The manager came over after that and said he would expedite another one and tried to explain that the dressings come in a large gallon bucket and so that was rubbery ball was in the gallon of dressing (I actually own a restaurant that serves salads and have never come across something like that in 18 years).  

Well, after 15 minutes I finally got another salad.  When we were all done eating, the waitress brought our check to us.  On the bottom of the check it said that there was a comp for a salad for $9.99.  I thought this was a great way to remedy the problem (again, owning a restaurant myself, I would have done the same thing).  HOWEVER, when looking over the entire bill - Chompies staff/manager went ahead and charged me for TWO salads, comping only ONE them!  This way, it looked like they were comping the salad, but they really got paid for it!  We only ordered ONE salad!!

We asked the manager who was standing by our booth, if he meant to charge us for two salads, taking only one of our bill.  He was a bit stunned!  What a sneaky way to do business.  We payed the bill in full and WILL NEVER RETURN!!!!!!"}
{"text":"got my half corned beef sandwich on rye to go.  opened the box and oh my....a tower of meat in between two small slices of bread....
how in the world will that fit in my mouth? 
somehow i devoured it..and it was delicious. came with 3 wedges of pickles for cleansing i believe...

lady behind the counter was super nice.  

restaurant is right next to the mall, so prepare yourself to walk off the excess meaty goodness.  bakery looks yums as well with bread, cookies, cakes!! they also have cream cheese, bagels, lox, knishes."}
{"text":"This place is extremely under rated. It's not your typical modern hipster \"avocado toast\" type place, and that's probably why it's got 3.5 stars. But I had the best pastrami of my life here. I mean this pastrami was so tender it was like fatty beef brisket, it literally melts in your mouth. So if you're looking for good tasting food, then go here and rate them. But if you're looking for cool hip vibe, then this ain't the place for you."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Our waitress was super attentive and the menu is ginormous. The portions are huge too. My boyfriend had the French roast which is deep fried and tastes a lot like a churro. Super rich and yummy.  I had the eggs Benedict which comes on a bagel. The egg was poached perfect. We plan on making a tradition of going every Sunday. See you there!!"}
{"text":"Two of us went there for a traditional Thanksgiving dinner. Everything was delicious. The portion size was good. Neither of us went home with the desire to snack. The only thing that would have made it better would have been the availability of dark turkey meat. It seemed to be white deli turkey."}
{"text":"Good prompt service (once we sat down, we had a little wait time to get seats that was tolerable). We had the Classic Grandpa Ruby's sandwich with pastrami, grilled sauerkraut, Swiss cheese on two latkes (potato pancakes requested instead of bread, a little surcharge) with 1000 Island dressing on the side. It was Delicious. Eating the moist pastrami brought back fun memories of NYC. The matzo ball soup was perfect. A great time was had by all. We recommend this NYC experience in AZ. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"This place always has slow service. Most of the time they get our order wrong. Tried to give this place another shot, just to be disappointed. Would not recommend !"}
{"text":"I can't eat here anymore. The food is fine and the bagels are the best in town. The shit attitudes and poor service kill it. Fuck Chompie's!"}
{"text":"I have frequented this location as well as the Tempe one and I like this one more because it is closer. Their food is consistently good and the portions are very large, probably too large for most. They could probably make them smaller and knock a couple of bucks off the price. Their menu is big but if you pay attention it is a variety of things made with the same staples. For example, I come here for the corn beef and hash (delicious! this isn't the crap that comes in a can) and the menu lists the same dish served several different ways. 
Great food and good service. The bagels can't be beat (it must be the water)."}
{"text":"Chompies has the best matzo balls ever! Their service is pretty awful so I don't eat in very often, but when I'm feeling under the weather there's nothing like an order of matzo ball soup to go! I think it's a bit pricey, but since there's no where else to get this stuff, I can't really complain. I get the small size soup with an extra matzo ball and the total is around $7. (I love the matzo balls but have never been a big soup fan; I like just enough soup to keep the matzo balls warm)"}
{"text":"This place is Awesome. I had the chicken noodle soup tonight and it was fresh and amazing. However, my very favorite thing to get from here is a salt bagel with lox cream cheese. It is sooo good. If you go early in the morning you can get a bagel and coffee for like $4. The coffee isn't great but that's not why you go to chompies."}
{"text":"Best corn beef in Arizona.  The menu is huge serving anything from omelets to pot roast. Huge mile high sandwiches and you can have half a sandwich or a mixture (one half corn beef the other half turkey). The wait staff at this location are usually college students who really go out of their way to make your visit a good one.  Meal are huge and come fast from the kitchen.  There is a very large bakery where you can get cookies, cakes , brownies and specialty breads. Would I come back here?  you bet I have been going to Chompie's for almost 30 years when it was a little restaurant  located on 40th street (I think) north of Shea."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I have a feeling that after another trip or two, this 4 star review would likely become a 5. 

The bagels were fabulous.

We had some of the Thanksgiving Sliders with turkey, cranberry sauce, perfectly grilled potato pancakes and turkey gravy on the side; they were fantastic!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd or 3rd visit to this location and we won't be back. We went on Friday night and saw that they have an all you can eat fish and chips special. My husband asked the hostess what kind of fish it was, and she said, \"cod, I would guess.\" Strange that she would guess about what they are having for the special.
We were seated right away and our server was nice. She took our drink orders and got the drinks quickly. She recommended the fish special saying it was great.
I ordered half of a corned beef sandwich with fries and my husband ordered the fish. While we waited for our food, someone tried to serve us the food from 3 other tables. I could see how that would happen once, but 3 times! 
My sandwich was fine. I ordered it lean, so it was a bit dry. Their fries are great - and they did not disappoint. The plate of fish and chips was heaping full. The fish looks like it's hand breaded as the breading was very puffy. But it was awful - the fish was really tough and nearly inedible. 
My husband left more than half of it on his plate, and the server didn't notice or even ask us how things were. When she brought our credit card back for signature, I told her that the fish was really bad, and pretty much inedible. She said, \"i wish you had told me that before.\" That's all. She didn't even offer to share my complaint with the manager. As we left, the hostesses asked how our meal was and I again told them that the fish was terrible. They just kind of shrugged and said they were sorry - again, nothing was done to alert management or try to correct the bad impression left on us. 

Their prices are high for a casual restaurant, so they need to really do something to impress you to keep your business. They are not doing that.

I'll probably go back for sliced meat at the deli and maybe some baked goods, but not to have a meal on location."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast with a couple friends on a Tuesday morning at about 9:30am.  The restaurant was busy but we were seated right away.  The service was superb and the food yummy.  A friend and I shared some dish with chiles and potatoes and eggs and avocado on top.  I am so glad we shared... plenty of food for two.  I love that bagels come with the breakfast.  I am a fan of bagels!!  Mmmmm...  Everything in the bakery is so pretty and delicious looking but I was to full to think about taking something to go.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Ok, I am giving four stars when I should give one. My wife and I went to Chompie's and we were promptly greeted by a very friendly hostess. The restaurant was busy so we had to wait maybe ten minutes for our table. When we were seated our server came over got our drink orders, then our food order, then nothing! Now that is all the press I'll give to the worst server...ever!! This Yelp is about Adam, the GM. I spoke with him and he was amazing, he apologized, seemed genuinely disappointed with his server, and didn't go overboard with winning us back. We had an issue with one meal, so he comped it. Perfect! He stopped by our table, we did some small talk, again he seemed genuinely engaged. Because of Adam and the food we will be back. Hopefully, we won't get the same service but we have faith in Adam!  Thanks for listening."}
{"text":"I came away from my third meal here confused and a little perplexed.  Ate there three times before reviewing to make sure my ducks were in a row.  Why confused?  because I'm not sure why this place has to be so darned expensive.  It's a sandwich, kids.  A sandwich.  Bread, meat, cheese.  I understand about overhead and stuff, but you're telling me this masterpiece of sandwich technology is worth $14?  I'm not so sure.  Don't get me wrong... you won't leave here hungry.  The aforementioned meat portion is flat out huge... my mandibles were unable to get around the top and bottom of it in the same bite episode, forcing me to attack from somewhere in the middle.  The sandwich... \"Aaron's Choice\" featured both corned beef and pastrami, some slaw, and 1000 Island dressing.  (AKA a New Yorker)  The onion roll assigned to the task of containing all this sandwichy goodness gave a great effort, but collapsed in defeat about 3/4 of the way through, forcing me to finish off with a fork.  Some very good, room-temp Swiss took the flavor to a higher level, but all in all... it's a SANDWICH.  By the time the beverage, tax and tip are factored in, I've just blown $20 for lunch on ...a sandwich.  Good flavor and pretty good service, yes... but I could do lunch at Ruth's Chris for about the same financial outlay.  Sorry Chompie's... two stars."}
{"text":"I wholeheartedly recommend for a quick craving satisfier, but not so much as a lunch. I would come in for a quick bagel or a quick pastry and that's it. Though it is convenient and satisfies a gourmet bagel experience missing from Paradise Valley, the value I get out of my meal can be better spent piling my own sandwich high with lunch meat rather than pay 3x as much for deli turkey."}
{"text":"Its history outweighs its quality. The service is consistently good but the prices are ever increasing and it's not the same as when they were at 32/Greenway or 32/Shea for that matter. 
I'm surprised they didn't buy a building instead of relying on a big mall that has become an albatross."}
{"text":"We have been to every single Chompies in the valley multiple times. This Chompies is becoming my favorite .  Always crowded,  but service is fast and you get seated quickly.  The menu is huge. The portions are large and the food is just like being home in NYC.  Real cornbeef, Dr Browns, cream soda.  I have died and gone to heaven. The wait staff are, polite, aim to please and know the menu.   Chompies
Bakery is amazing, fresh bagels, cookies, breads, and cakes.  If you want to taste real east coast deli and wonderful Jewish meals.  Chompies is the only place to come."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money or appetite! I can only speak to this location, but I wish there was a way to get both of mine back. We went on a Saturday evening, and because of the noise level and air conditioning, we asked to be seated outside. We were curtly told \"no\". We the asked if we order \"to go\", if we could sit on the patio to eat. You would have thought we were asking for the moon. To make a long story of terrible service shorter, after waiting a half hour to get an order that was cold and incomplete, we had to beg for silverware and and napkins - they obviously resented our use of the patio and did everything possible to \"punish\" us for our decision. 

Their strategy worked; we not only regretted sitting outside, but choosing this restaurant in the first place- we will NEVER make that mistake again.

When I asked to speak to the manager, they would not even indulge that request.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY WHERE IT'S NOT APPRECIATED"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband for Hanukkah dinner, figured lines would be extremely long but we were very surprised to be seated right away.  We both ordered the 2 Jewish Sliders with the matzoh ball soup. They were SO good but insanely messy.  The bread did start to get a little soggy from the gravy by the time I started on the 2nd one.  I think next time I will order with gravy on the side.  Lots of food & prices were pretty on point with most delis.  We ordered some rainbow cookies to go which were DELISH! Can't wait to go back & try some more of their specials."}
{"text":"Dinner:  Decent AZ Deli food 
Breakfast:  Good selection and consistent
Price:  Average
Crowd:  Mostly seniors or young families with kids
Service:  Horrendous (would be 3 stars if they had decent service)"}
{"text":"Ample portions for breakfast special, but pancakes were dense.  Big bakery and seems to be popular with locals."}
{"text":"Phenomenal customer service, and great atmosphere overall. The food was incredible. My boyfriend and I came in early on a Sunday morning and were greeted and seated immediately. This was our first time at Chompies, and we were thoroughly impressed with our experience. Our server Faith was wonderful. She was very kind and courteous towards us. We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Living outside of the US, there are a few food items I MUST have when I come back.  Setting foot on US soil, I knew that was a pastrami sandwich and that it HAD to be from Chompies.  Chompies again, does not disappoint.  The wait staff is so friendly and the sandwiches are DELICIOUS.  This is my go to place every time we come back."}
{"text":"Matzo ball soup - love this place.  Nice selection and great service."}
{"text":"Well I know that people get busy. I've been there done that. But really I sat and waited for a Bagel for 20 mins."}
{"text":"Okay, I might have been a tad harsh after several bad experiences two years ago!  

One of their waitresses moved back to Europe, and things kind of went down hill for a while. We have been back to this location several times and the service has been improving.  Today is a good example.  I came by for a Baker's Dozen around noon time. It was a madhouse! Folks standing everywhere waiting to be seated. 

But, I was in and out within ten minutes or so.  David was directing traffic from behind the counter and doing a very good job.  BTW, it was only $9.42 for those thirteen bagels/ bialys!  So, so much better than the ones at Fry's and almost as good as New York Bagels 'N Bialys.

The major drawback continues to be their slower period around dinner time.  Like I said it's getting better. I guess if you've been on your feet for 5/6 hours and things slow down; you look for an opportunity to catch your breath.  

The food is very good, lets say Four Stars.  Service is Three Stars-ish.  And that New York kvetching?  Priceless!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have eaten from here multiple times, but always takeout or door dash.  We've enjoyed every meal, breakfast, lunch and dinner.  We have never eaten inside the restaurant, so I can't review that.  But the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"When I first sit down at Chompies there's just something comforting about that dish of pickles on the table.  Seriously, Chompies is the only place to get good Jewish deli food around here.  I've never had anything bad there, except sometimes the service (hence the four stars not five).  Excellent, excellent split pea soup, cheese blintzes, and breakfast combo meals of every possible variation.  

I recently tried the Cabo skillet and loved it.  Their hash browns are perfect - slightly crisp on the outside, soft in the middle, and salted just right.   If you're looking for something a little different, get the Bagel Skins - an innovative idea that I keep meaning to re-create at home but I never do. 

The deli sandwiches are great too -- just be aware that they are HUGE.  Luckily they also sell half sandwiches, and I usually order mine with half the turkey on two whole pieces of bread, because the human jaw simply was not built for sandwiches of Chompies' proportions.  Their turkey is delicious - SO much better than the slimy crap in the deli counter at the grocery store.  

In summary, yes the service could be better, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Have a second home in the Phoenix area and was looking for a good Jewish Deli.  Found it!  They even have my favorite soda,  Dr. Brown's Cel-rey diet.  Yummy flavor.  Good soup and Pastrami sandwiches."}
{"text":"Quality of food not what it used to be. Corn beef and pastrami sandwiches for takeout have been very dry. 
Found sandwiches at the Counter in Kierland to be of much better quality. 
For the price Chompie's charges not worth it. 

Damn Chompie's screwed up our order again. Bought soup. Asked for noodles carrots etc to be in separate containers. No broth now. We give up. Just have to unbag everything before paying. This is not rocket science. Just a bunch of idiots behind the counter."}
{"text":"A NY style Deli with an entire gluten free menu. I'm pretty sure I died and went to Heaven. Sadly though, I was too hungry the morning we came here, and they actual made homemade gluten free waffles, but I was not feeling it that morning. :(

I went with an omelet and gf bagel which was still epic that I could have a bagel. 

They have every option you can possibly imagine and as usual, huge portions. But for a very reasonable price. I wasn't hungry until dinner time. 

Def a cool place to check out for good eats."}
{"text":"Had the Western Sliders and they were very good. Definitely enough food to leave you full for the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"Very bad service the lady upfront she don't know how to do her job the waitress was good they have ice Coffe on there menu but when we asked for it they said they don't have the machine to make it"}
{"text":"Delicious beyond belief. This is not just your average sandwich shop. Wait staff was awesome and very helpful in food suggestions. Little bit of a wait to get seated but that is expected in a place that good. The breakfast was every bit as good as the lunch items."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Their menus is extensive. The salmon with capers on the potato thing is to die for. I dream about it it's so good.
The Corned Beef Hash is delicious and fresh. The pancakes are delicious. Once you eat go to the deli section and load up on fresh bread. The pumpernickel and rye bread are unbelievable.  Anytime  we are in the Phoenix area this place is a must. You won't be sorry go try it. Can get busy but wait staff is normally fast and efficient."}
{"text":"As a native New Yorker, I was missing the wonderful Jewish style foods. But then I found Chompies and I found heaven.  All of my childhood favorites that I can share with my non-New York friends."}
{"text":"The food, as always, was terrific. The service, however, was seriously lacking.  

We have never been for dinner, just breakfast and lunch.  We thought we would give it a try and we were excited to see it was not very full of patrons (if you go to Chompie's for breakfast, you know the controlled chaos that surrounds the dining room).  

It took forever to get our drinks ordered, and when we go our drinks our server dropped them and left before we could order our appetizer.  When we finally were able to order our server kept cutting us off.  

Our food came over a half hour after we ordered it, and well after 2 other tables that came in after us were served. I am convinced our server forgot to put in our order.

Then on the way out we stopped at the bakery.  It took close to 10 minutes to get someone to help us.  The night hostess had to go to the back and make someone come out and help us and another customer.

We will definitely go back for dinner, but I'm making sure we won't be in that servers section again."}
{"text":"Too bad you can't leave negative numbers. Ive Door Dashed from this Chompie's twice, and both times they completely missed 1 of 4 meals we ordered. 

It's not hard Chompie's - make the food, out it in the box, and put the box in the bag. One job!"}
{"text":"Group of 8 visited after an early movie. All were pleased.  Huge \"small salad\", good soups and the winner was the corned beef half sandwich with a cup of soup.  Bonus points go for the check in gift of the big black & white cookie.  Thanks, Chompie's."}
{"text":"First visit to Chompie's
I was craving corn beef hash and eggs and they have it. 
It was soooo good.  The service was perfect and the ambiance fun and colorful.  My husband had the turkey dinner, so delicious.  Real white meat turkey, not a turkey roll like a lot of places do and the stuffing was delicious also.  The gravy was real (I know good gravy, I love gravy) this gravy was not from a can and it had bits of turkey in it, very flavorful.
We also had the onion rings with their dipping sauce, it reminded me a bit of Outback blooming onion and sauce, defiantly homemade, would have that again.
Looking forward to going back for another item on the menu."}
{"text":"So Deli is always in my vocab especially before holiday - G'Mar Tov!!
Bryan and I have been here a few times since opening - had one bad experience with cold food. But Chompie's just knows how to hit the spot... ya know!!
I love the Mushroom Barley Soup, Split Pea Soup, the Burgers, my all-time fav knishes...OH and of course any-type of corned beef sandwich!!
YUM!!!
Service sometimes can be a hit or miss at this location but still a regular favorite of mine - true COMFORT food!!"}
{"text":"Food is always awesome. Staff didn't panic when my wife has a medical emergency. Manager was beyond helpful and knew what needed to be done in this situation. These people are professionals and not just in the kitchen. Thank you again...          M"}
{"text":"Don't waste the gas to go here. Let me start with the service. Our server COULDNT HAVE CARED LESS about anything. The restaurant was practically empty, there were 2 other servers, and we had to wave him down if we wanted something. Moving on to the food....TERRIBLE! If it wasn't overcooked, it was horribly presented or items missing from the dish. On the way out we purchased 2 black/white cookies to take home for dessert. You guessed it...STALE! The FINAL STRAW....BLARING music coming from the kitchen, so loud we couldn't have a conversation. The manager must have overheard us talking about how we'd never be back, so he asked us how everything was, but when we told him, he mumbled an insincere apology and walked away. RUN DON'T WALK AWAY FROM THIS DUMP!"}
{"text":"I have eaten several times at Chompies and the food seems to have gone downhill in my opinion.  My husband and I went for breakfast to the Chandler location.  We got there at 7:30 in the morning on a Saturday.  We walk in and the hostess asked us how many in our party.  It was just the two of us and she said ok, hold on a sec.  So we waited while she went to get menus and then came back to seat us.  We were two of the maybe ten customers in the place.  Not sure why we had to wait when the place was empty.  Kinda weird.  Our waitress was very nice, took our order and was all around a great gal.  The food however was not that great today.  I ordered the Cragel Riser.  A cross between a bagel and a croissant.  There was nothing croissanty about it.  It was a bagel, period!  And a very dried out bagel at that.  It was awful.  The eggs were very dry and folded in half and you could barely find any bacon in it.  I left most of it on the plate. And it is too big for the plate.  The top part of the Cragel had to be placed on a napkin on the table, not good.  Just put it on the bigger plate!  My husband had the whole grain pancakes.  He said they were ok but the butter they gave him to put on it was in those little prepackaged squares and it was ice cold and hard as a rock.  Can ya just put some soft butter in a little cup and serve it that way!  Terrible presentation skills as far as I'm concerned.  Maybe I am watching too much Top Chef but I know how something should be served.  Cold butter on pancakes is just not good.   The coffee was decent, but that was about it.  Not sure what the deal is here but food is not good anymore.  The last time I bought the rugelah from the bakery they were stale and hard.  I complained about it when I got home and they offered to give me some new ones.  For 15.00 bucks a pound they should be fresh and tasty.  Now I know why I won't go back, unless the food improves immensely.  They just have too much on the menu to have good consistent quality food."}
{"text":"One of our go-to places for dinner. Pretty good food. Large portions for the money. Decent service too. Nice place to have breakfast for dinner when the urge hits. Menu is huge."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place in the entire world! I live in Bakersfield Ca and I go here every time I come to Arizona! The bakery here is truly out of this world delicious! Nothing beats the staff and the food here at chompies!!!! Their cragels are amazing so are all their bagels and different flavored cream cheeses! They make the best sliders in the world! Chompies will truly never disappoint you, no matter what you are in the mood for! Their pastrami sandwich is pretty stellar too! I miss chompies I'll be back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"People say this place is good, but my experience was bad on all fronts - food, service, and management.   

Our waiter was utterly clueless about deli cuisine, let alone the Jewish specialties.  Unable to coherently answer whether potato latkes were made fresh or if they were reheated, didn't quite understand knishes, you get the picture.  Plus it seemed he had no training in the basics of waiting tables.   Like when he left his shift without telling us he was handing our table over to another server.... seriously???  

I thought the pea soup was too salty, until I tasted the pastrami sandwich that was practically inedible.  And this was after I had gone to the deli counter to see whether their meats were any good!  

The manager on duty explained that the soup can get salty if it's been on the burner all day.  Great, but shouldn't someone check on that from time to time?  Re: pastrami, she checked the meat and and confirmed it was over the top.  According to the deli guy every once in a blue moon they'll get a piece of meat that wasn't cured properly.  I mentioned the poor service and the manager excused it due to our server being new. She was sorry I had a bad experience, and offered a replacement sandwich or desert to go.  I didn't need more food, nor did I want to even try if they couldn't prepare food correctly twice.  It would have been better to offer to take my meal off the bill completely, which I would have asked for if it weren't for one of my friends picking up the bill.

Three good things I can say about this place - the kugel was excellent, the knishes were pretty decent, and they serve Dr. Brown's soda.  Otherwise - MEH!

It's possible that my experience was a fluke, and that I just happened to have a perfect storm of untrained server, incompetent management and poorly prepared food.  May be if one of those had gone right I'd feel differently, but as it was I would give this place a miss."}
{"text":"My son's Bagel came burnt and it was obvious that they had tried to scraped off the burnt part with the knife, but it was still clearly black on most of the surface.  When you go to a bagel place you expect a good bagel and it surprised me that they even survived it to him.  Well mistakes happen and that is not the reason for the 1 star.  the reason for 1 star was the response I received.  It was near closing time when the food arrived and they said that all of the bagels had been put away so they could not replace it.  The waitress offered a discount of $2 off the bagel part of my son's mean (his meal was $12 total).  He did eat the rest, but that is because he was Hungary and the rest of us were started eating.  It was not about the money, but I was not happy with them serving him a burnt bagel, being unwilling to get a new bagel for him in the back and only offering $2 off so I asked for the manager.  The manager said she would comp the meal, but when the bill came it was only the $2 off.  I paid the bill and give a less than normal tip, but its really disappointing that they would not either (a) give him the bagel that he wanted (meaning getting the put away bagels out for him), or (b) comp the whole meal.  This really took away from what was a nice evening with the family.  The food was actually pretty good, but with service like this we will not be back."}
{"text":"Love this Chompie's!

Service is always friendly, and the good is delish! 

Sometimes there is a bit of a wait, but always worth it.

We keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Pastrami sandwiches as good as NYCity's delis at half the price. Great waitstaff"}
{"text":"Normally I absolutely love this place. Everyone is so great. Food is delicious and bakery is great. This morning however was service mistake after service mistake. Waiters name was Alex younger black dude. He was nice just took forever to do everything this morning. Coffee cup set empty most of breakfast. Food took forever to come out. When it did my corn beef hash was ice cold with a hot egg on top, that made for a really weird first bite. The food was actually delivered by the General Manager. It was busy and maybe he didn't notice the place was cold. Now I'm not one to send food back so I just ate the bagel. Figured when Alex came back and had seen I only ate the bagel he'd ask. Ha! Nope just said \"let me get this out of the way\" maybe Alex was having an off day or maybe he was overwhelmed with his section. So I still gave him a good tip. On the way out I see Alex helping a lady pick out cookies in the bakery... good customer service for the lady I guess but what about the 9 tables full of people with no coffee and cold food... oh well, Chompie's is still one of my favorites. Just failed me this morning.

UPDATE: Less than 24hrs later a member of Chompie's reached out to me and expressed concern over the issues I had. This is why I love this place. Truly care about their customers. I can't stress enough how happy I am with their response. So I've change my review to 4 stars"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly. Can honestly say I have never had bad service there. The food is amazing. The gravy is the best sauce to dip the fries into. Their menu is large and gives plenty of chooses for all in you group to find something they will love."}
{"text":"My grandfather, who's from New York, has been taking me to this chain since before I even knew how to spell Chompies correctly. In my opinion, the best thing here always has been and always will be their pastries. Their black and whites are still the best I've had with the ones from Canter's in LA running a close second.

As for the rest of their food, it's not bad. It's not great, but it definitely runs a fine line between mediocre and pretty good. I think the issue is that the food is so filling and you just keep eating it even though you're stomach is screaming at you to convince you that it can't hold anymore. It's like comfort food with a vengeance. Go for the matzo ball soup, but DON'T order the fried matzo ball appetizer. It sounds potentially good, but it's deceptive.

In all, you've got to give props to this place for sticking around this long and still being family run. I'll still come back here, but I think it will be for the pastries rather than what I can get as a meal."}
{"text":"Great place to go for bagels, I personally think their food prices are high for what you get. The only reason why I won't go back is because the staff have always been rude when we were going there. If you don't order your bagel fast enough you get attitude."}
{"text":"After ten years of Spring Training in the Phoenix area, my dad and I have scaled back on the exploration of new breakfast joints. Chompies has a great menu, friendly service, and the food quality is consistently good. It's no DZ Akin's, but it's the closest thing we've found in our many visits."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Wednesday afternoon around 2pm.  Not very crowded but took 10 minutes to get a server.  We both ordered soup and a sandwich.  Sandwiches came out before soup did.  My sandwich  ( brisket on a challah roll) came out as corned beef on rye... ???

We were checked on once and then the check was dropped.  Food was just above mediocre. 

I'm sure there are better places."}
{"text":"Ate lunch at Chompie's years ago and liked it. But this time, I was looking for bagels to eat before running a half marathon. If they could, we hoped to get a dessert to celebrate a parent's birthday.

The woman at the front counter could not have been more helpful. She was ready to assist when we came in the door and advised on what we should order. We ordered a half dozen bagels and cream cheese. We also ordered carrot cake and chocolate box cake. All food was to go.

Our daughter is a huge fan of Despicable Me. They had a chocolate item with a Despicable Me minion on it so we HAD to order it. (They also had baked goods with characters that strongly resembled Big Bird, Elmo and Cookie Monster.)

Everything was delicious. The cakes were especially good.

We hadn't thought of Chompie's as a first choice for cakes but we'll definitely go back -- me for the carrot cake and my wife for their chocolate cake."}
{"text":"Scott is borderline obsessed with Chompie's, and I don't blame him! It all started when I was sick and wanting some 'Jewish Penicillin' aka Matzoh Ball Soup, and sent him there. He called me and said \"I feel like I'm in a Jewish Deli at home (NY)!\" Makes sense, since the family that owns Chompie's is from Queens. 

Since then, he finds any excuse he can to go, and we've had a variety of delicious items: the aforementioned soup; turkey sandwich; turkey dinner; potato knish; Mish Mosh Soup (Matzoh Ball, Chicken Noodle, and Kreplach mixed!) rainbow cookies, black & white cookies (free with Yelp! check in) Linzer tarts, butter cookies, fruit tart, onion strings, and kashe varnishkes. Only the last two disappointed: the strings were oil logged, and Scott didn't care for the varnishkes. 

I had their bagels a few years ago when I was in Scottsdale for a conference, and they were super. They offer a wide variety of flavors, gluten free options, and lots of delicious cream cheese varieties. Their lox and whitefish offerings are stellar. They have extensive catering options and make custom cakes for special occasions. 

They serve Gulden's mustard :) We are fans!

{"text":"I had a day off from work and time to kill. I was running errands at the mall and getting hungry. I decided on Chompie's because I was craving eggs. At this location, I know that breakfast is available all day. I seated myself at the bar. The bartender was attentive and kind. I looked over the many items on the menu. There is much variety to chose from. I finally decided on a breakfast quesadilla aka chompadillla. The dish came out within 15-20 minutes after I ordered. It tasted delicious! I would come back again and eat the same dish. Good food and big portions. Price is reasonable for quality and portion size."}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow, and customer service is poor.... Food is just .... Meh.... Place is very run down and in need of some serious updating....
If you enjoy slow crappy service and sub standard food this place is for you.... If not, scottsdale has many many other options that are by far more appetizing than Chompies."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Chompie's in years but our experience tonight will bring us back much sooner.  Our server, Matt was AMAZING, hilarious, helpful and very pleasant.  The food was effin' FANTASTIC!!!!  
We start with the potato pancake sampler, and we both had the Jewish sliders with the soup of the day (turkey and rice) and sweet potato fries and brought a creme brûlée home for later!  Everyone there deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"Once again Chompie's WOW!!!  Today we had a large party (9 folks!) and the service and food was AMAZING again!  Being around noon on a Sunday it was of course, very busy, but the wait wasn't very long, maybe 20 minutes TOPS and even that was pleasant with atmosphere, the yummy bakery to look around and the generous water and bread available at the hostess stand to munch on, and of course it just allowed us some time to shop around and buy far too many delicious things from the bakery while we waited :-).  (We walked out of there with 5 creme brûlées and a loaf of your low carb bread!!!) Our server, Linsey, was over the top awesome!  She was super fast, VERY friendly and VERY helpful! We never went a second without full drinks and every other extra we could possibly ask for.  (Yes ALL NINE of us...that is no small feat!!!). Our table had so many different things such as my fave, the Jewish Sliders, my husband's new favorite, (and maybe mine judging by what I stole off his plate!). the Chicken Fried Steak burger...WOW AMAZING!....there were many others the Monte Cristo, Smoked Salmon, Matzo Ball soup, potato pancakes and of course some sweet potato fries and many other amazing dishes, not to forget the endless strawberry lemonades!!!   DELICIOUS!!!  
Thank you Linsey!!!  Thank you Chompies!!!
Oh yea, and Thank you again Linsey for helping my mother-in-law get set up with the rewards app on her phone, that was super sweet of you!!!
We will be back again and again and again!!!!

Everyone there deserves a raise!  :-)"}
{"text":"Today we came to Chompies with a reservation at 10:30. We made this reservation four weeks ago. It is now 11:00 and we haven't moved. This place has been a staple for us as we are a family of East Coasters. No more. This will be the last time we come here.

Update: 11:25 we were finally seated. In the meantime, my husband had to spend his Father's Day being repetitively told by the hostess and an older lady (owner I presume) that they were \"getting our table ready\". They were extremely rude and dismissive and never once offered an apology or any type of compensation for my wasted time and inconvenience. Only after being in the restraunt for over two hours did the older lady come to thank us for our patronage, once again no offers to make things right or apologies. I can honestly say that I have never been treated so poorly including my 30 plus years in New York."}
{"text":"Best Reuben Ive Found Anywhere.
Corned Beef, Pastrami, how lean do you want it?

Usually have to wait for a table but the its a great NY Deli place where the sandwiches easily top a pound. I have a hard time trying things other than the Reuben from the menu because its so good other things on their incredably large and varied menu are also very good. I personally don't care for their brisket, finding it dry and bland, but everything else is good.

Of note is their Mile High sandwiches - yes they are stacked high, the pickles are simply awesome and come to your table at lunch and dinner, breakfast/brunch here is top notch, and everyone should indulge in a Yummy french toast at least once - it makes a great desert so save room.

You usually have to wait for a table, especially during breakfast/brunch but its busy all the time. This location can be a bit loud with the college crowd but its not bad.

Dont forget the bread, bagels, and pastires. The rye bread is simply the best rye and can sometimes be found in your grocery store if your very lucky."}
{"text":"I was at the mall on Monday and thought I'd try chompies.  Not only was it delicious and authentic, and we had such a nice waitress Judy. She was so attentive and thorough. Judy was very pleasant and made suggestions about what was good. She told us about a rewards program, but we were from out of state. When I go back I'll definitely look for her again and look forward to trying different tasty treats."}
{"text":"It is hard for me to rate them 2 stars because the food is really good and the portions are huge. That being said we went there today for Easter.  We got there before my parents and we were seated and Austin came and asked up what would would like to drink, we ordered drinks and I told him we were waiting for my parents and it would be about 10-15 minutes. He said ok and he would check back with us.  My parents finally arrived about 20 minutes later , they were comming from a quite a distance. At this point I would like to point out the place was no crowded at all and there were like 10 tables open so we were not taking up any room.  
When my parents got the Austin's attitude seemed to change. When I ordered the Jewish sliders he read off the sides like a robot and the same when my mom ordered them.  Then my dad ordered something different and asked what came with it and he seemed annoyed he had to repeat it.    At that point my mom said to me (after he left) that he doesn't seem happy today.  It was a quite a difference from the waitress next to us who greeted her table with a big Happy Easter and a smile. Yeah he never smiled. Oh well.. When we got the check my mom said she needed to give him her phone number for her points.  So when he came back with the check my mom said very nicely oh I forgot to give you my number . He threw the pen down and said right it down.  You could tell he must have been having a bad day.  It made me sad because myself and my parents were so polite to him.  Then he obviously wasn't happy with the tip we left him. My dad gave him cash and he didn't even say thank you . 
When he came he gave my dad his debit card receipt and walked away. 
Last time I checked a tip was a gratuity based on how we liked the service and while he did fill the glasses up and come back , his attitude could have been better."}
{"text":"I went here for the 1st time today they were having a special for their anniversary buy 1 Jewish slider get one 1/2 price.  We got there right around 10:45 am and we seated really fast. Our waitress I forgot her name but she was awesome! She came and took the drink order and brought them fast. My husband had the sliders and he loved them. I had the Matzo Ball soup, not that I wouldn't have died for a slider but I just had surgery and cant eat them . I didn't even finish my soup.  Our waitress was nice enough to offer us to go containers and even gave us Ice Tea and my husband soda to go. She was very prompt and efficient. I will definately go back once I am able to actually eat and enjoy what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE this place. There's a dearth of good diner food in Phoenix, but if you're looking for good, home cooked comfort food you will not be disappointed!

The matzoh ball soup is as good as your Bubbies' with big chunks of veggies, flavorful broth and insanely tasty chicken bits. 

The latkes are yummy and the mile high sandwiches are insane.

Don't leave without stopping by the bakery for a black and white cookie. I want to eat every dessert in the place."}
{"text":"My experience in the past has always been 5 stars.
I usually am waited on by either Carrie or Issac.
While today's service wasn't horrible it did seem to irritate me. It was just after 8am and I sat at a pub table in the bar in clear view of all.
My server was engaging in conversation with another server they were kidding around with each other but acting like they were alone shouting out over guests and frankly paying more attention to each other than us guests. I had to ask for a second cup of coffee when mine became empty and he just poured a new cup and dropped it off , not taking the other away. My second fill up was noticed and filled by the busser. 
I watched as he took another single persons order then go to the computer and shout over the lady at the bar re-confirming the order. COTTAGE CHEESE, right??!
I think work shouldn't suck but be aware of who is the priority here. 
I of course will continue to be here on a regular basis and Im sure this was a isolated incident."}
{"text":"We have visited the Paradise Valley location several times and it has always been stellar. Excellent east coast style service, very friendly management and of course, fabulous food. Hot Pastrami on Rye and and order of Sliders. It does not get any better. Excellent take-out counter. Puts LA delis to shame (except Brent's)."}
{"text":"There are two parts to this review: the food and the service. 

The food: 5-star all the way! I love eating at Chompie's. I always get the Turkey Reuben - WOW - it is so good: great turkey, great sauerkraut, great bread and cheese, and even great 1000 Island. The French Fries are awesome potatoes wedges. 

The service: 1-star seems generous. It seems like the service is ok at best most of the time, but occasionally terrible! Last night our service was slow, our waiter was difficult and when we left he started to accuse us of not paying (we left the full amount of the bill on the table with a overly-generous tip after we had not seen him for 10 MINUTES). 

Will I go back to Chompie's? Probably, but NOT very soon!"}
{"text":"All of the deli servers are wonderful. I especially enjoy Bagel Wednesday along with fresh rye bread and black-and-white cookies!

I thought that was a bit pricey.  I do like that the breakfast comes with a bagel though.  I saved my onion bagel for lunch.  ;)"}
{"text":"I feel a little bad giving Chompie's a three-star review; really, they're more like a 3.25-star place, and I grade that mostly on the dry-ish omelet I had here. The service was pleasant and attentive, and I couldn't find anything else I was unhappy about; but my regular haunts back home turn a better omelet. Maybe it's just homesickness talking."}
{"text":"Everytime I've decided to grab a bite at chompies I have never been disappointed. For one, they have a giant menu which covers breakfast, sandwiches as well as dinner specials. Basically any meal you wanted for the day, it is there. Usually they start you out with homemade pickles as a starter. Sometimes the batches are delicious and other times they are very bland cucumber bites.

For breakfast I suggest getting their eggs Benedict. I chose their greek one and was not dissapointed. The serving size was huge and the leftovers were even better. It was even served on this amazing twist of a bagel. Oh my, delicious!

For dinner I suggest the Jewish sliders. They come on challah bread which is made fresh. Sometimes it can be a bit greasy but it is worth every bite.

As for the deli. They have great selections of things you won't find anywhere. I like to stop in for a bagel in the morning. Their bagels are always fresh and the cream cheese is perfect. Not too hard or soft, just right. The also carry different bagels like salt bagels. Crazy, righr?!

Lastly their desserts are amazing! definitely share it or get it to go. I like the chocolate box cake personally. They also have breads and other selections to take home.

I almost forgot about the atmosphere. Around Jewish holidays this place is packed so plan accordingly.the summer is a little dead but it can be chaotic during the school year."}
{"text":"I stopped by just now to purchase what I thought would be a beautiful cupcake or a slice of cake to take to my friend at work on her birthday. The presentation in the refrigerated unit at the bakery counter was just disgusting! Not only was it ugly and looks like everything had been touched and moved 100 times, there's whipped cream smeared all over the inside of the refrigerated unit that appears to of been there for at least a month because it has turned that crusty yellow color!  I am not buying here and even though I've never tried their food, I don't intend to. Cleanliness and presentation is so important to me."}
{"text":"Third time at this Compie's at arrowhead and second time bad service. We had to ask for pickles 3 times and was finally told they were out of the half sours. I ordered a corned beef sandwich and Matzo Ball soup which too 30 minutes. Their matzo balls are ok but not as good as mine. The manager came by and introduced himself and we told him all the problems. He was so apologetic and agreed our service was terrible. He took half off of our bill. How can a Jewish Deli not have pickles??? The last time we were there, our waitress was very slow she was there this time and remembered us. She was actually helping our waiter. By the time I got my soup, I had to take it home. We will probably go again since their the only Jewish Deli around. We just won't sit in a certain section. Thank you John for helping us and making sure our experience was a little better!"}
{"text":"If you want deli food and you live in the valley of the sun, Chompies is your best option."}
{"text":"I have only been to the deli and the service is amazing.  However, my favorite item from Jewish deli's is the Matzo Ball Soup.  The first time ordered it I was sure that they had run out of homemade Matzo Ball Soup and used Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup instead.  First I was surprised that there was Chicken pieces in there as that is NOT how my Bubie used to make it (nor my mom or aunts, nor any Jewish Deli in Chicago, etc...) then I tasted it and it tasted much more like Campbell's than any homemade or Jewish Deli-made Matzo Ball soup I have had.  

So I gave it a second chance and went there again yesterday.  I ordered the matzo ball soup, but it was even more disappointing than the first time.  I need to find a deli that makes the real MBS in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"It's a nice place great food BT ... me n husband were on Sat oct 7th around 9 ish in the morning we followed the hostess to our table she had on her hands a little dish to try out some muffins bt when she place the dish on table somehow the  samples of muffins fall off on the table .. so she pick up with her bare hands n put it back on the dish  she never apologized or said I'm sorry NOT TO MENTION THAT ... IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA BRING A NEW SAMPLES ..!! Right ? Isn't that the right thing to do ?? She is an older lady has a short hair kind of red or brown with a tinted piece grey or white  on her hair ...!! Hmmm I wonder is the manager knows about this ..!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a New York hot pastrami sandwhich on rye bread. not even close . it was alright, but not great. there bagels are delicious tho. I guess coming from nyc makes it hard to like the pastrami here :("}
{"text":"My husband and I both come from great Jewish Deli states (Michigan and NYC.)  We both know what good Jewish Deli should taste like and Chompies is.....OK.  I can forgive the bread.  I understand that on this side of the country it is simply impossible to make really good bread because of the water.  Chompies rye bread and bagels are actually the best I've tasted in Arizona.  What I can't forgive is the corned beef and pastrami.  They are both so chewy and fatty and I don't understand why, even if I order it lean it still comes out extremely fatty!  To be honest every time I've tried a sandwich from Chompies I've been disappointed.  

When we go here my husband usually orders a cheeseburger, he loves Chompies cheeseburgers, their fries and coleslaw are also very good.  I usually get a chopped liver appetizer.  Their chopped liver is amazingly good; it reminds me of my childhood making chopped liver with my grandma in her kitchen!  My new love at Chompies is the brisket sliders, they are yummy!  Their brisket is really really good and it's a huge amount of food! I always take at least one home.   I'm going to try the western sliders next time we go, I'm sure they'll be as good as the original.

I go to Chompies at least once or twice a month to pick up a ridiculous amount of smoked fish for my husband and me to eat over the weekend.  They have all the classic smoked fishes you'd expect at a Jewish Deli, my personal favorite is sable; yes it is worth $40 a pound :)  Their whitefish salad is also really good, it has large pieces of white fish in it and scallions.  They also have a lot of different flavors of cream cheese including my husband's favorite, olive pimento.  The bakery section takes me back to my childhood.  It reminds of going to the Jewish Bakery on Friday mornings with my mother to get bread for Shabbat dinner.  It doesn't hurt that they have my favorite apricot hamentacshen!"}
{"text":"Ok the food was great but when he server adds extra to her tip when I already tipped 20 percent that's not right. Won't be back"}
{"text":"These  do not seem to know what they are doing. While the food is adequate, They moved me from my table while I was in the restroom. They charge $2.49 for a basic cup of coffee and they gave me the wrong check. When I pointed out the error, the server said she corrected it but my debit card was still overcharged. I tried to call the restaurant this morning to get things resolved but the phone rings once then nothing. I now have to dispute the change with my bank. Do not do business with Chompie's Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love the idea of this establishment. The decor is New York inspired and has the feel of a diner. There is a baker on one side and seating in the other. 

When you enter there are refreshments and bread with some type of spread. I assume this is for when there are long waits, by we didn't get a chance to try them. We were seated and our orders were taken pretty quickly.  

The coffee was very delicious. It was very hot and strong. Our waitress was attentive and even took our trash that accumulated from preparing our coffee. *My boyfriend and I both noticed it as one of our pet peeves is waiters who let sugar packet and tiny creamer pots pile up. :) 

The food was underwhelming. I ordered the buffalo eggs benedict. The bread it is served on was too hard and cold to enjoy, the hollandaise sauce was plain with the exception of a drizzle of buffalo sauce. My boyfriend selected a steak skillet breakfast. He really enjoyed it but the bagel given on the side was disappointing. He asked for a chives spread and was given cream cheese with chunks of chives. 

At the end of breakfast we unlocked the cookie offer and were positively surprised. 

Might be back but will definitely be trying something else. Overall this place deserves a 3.5 star rating."}
{"text":"When Friday arrives, I get excited because I know tomorrow is Saturday- Chompie's Day! I come here for breakfast with my family every weekend, and I am never disappointed. The hostesses are sweet and welcoming, and our servers are attentive and always give our two young ones a cookie. And the food- consistently on point!  (I recommend the Cabo Skillet.) Lovey also makes her rounds in the morning and greets customers to see how the food is; There is definitely a sense of pride that can be seen in the restaurant and tasted in the delicious dishes."}
{"text":"Get the sliders. Dip in gravy. Repeat. Again and again till your lady has to roll you out the front door."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is excellent, the portions are big, and the menu seems endless. One of the best kosher restaurants that I have been to."}
{"text":"WOW! WOW! WOW!! My mom always raves about Chompie's so I made her take me. I also wanted to try the Jewish sliders Adam Richman ate on Man vs. Food. Absolutely totally delicious!! Also had the matzo ball soup, a must have! They have quite an extensive menu, all fresh made on site and totally delicious!! You won't go wrong with anything you order! Heard the whitefish salad is amazing, will try that next!"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast and I loved it. I ordered the chicken fried steak burger, and it was very delicious. Instead of a beef patty it was chicken fried steak with sunnyside up eggs and their onion rings covered in white gravy between bread. Would definitely order it again. Their bagels are also really delicious. Their spreads are soo good. I love the onion and chive spread! Would definitely recommend this place to a friend. Their desserts are also quite good. My particular favorite is the chocolate cheesecake."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or a miss... I have occasionally had great food when I went here, while other times I have been disgusted.

Their bagels are quite delicious.  They apply a lot of cream cheese, so if you are counting calories, then make sure you have them put the cream cheese on the side.

I have had both the Regular Sliders and the Southwestern Sliders, and both are delicious... Try either, depending on if you would rather your meat have gravy or barbecue sauce, respectively.

I would stay away from their coffee.  Something just does not taste right in it.  That, and they do not provide fresh creamers.  

All in all, this is a decent place, with tons of options.  Stop on in if you're nearby, but do not drive out of your way for this one."}
{"text":"Sunday night, half an hour before closing.  This is a set-up for Disaster, right?  WRONG!

Server was as relaxed and friendly as if we were his First table of the night!  Described some of the items I didn't recognize.  Steered me away from something based on preferences I had shared. 

Ordered CABBAGE ROLLS and a side of perfectly wilted spinach with enough garlic to please the palate but not ruin the rest of the date. Really a robust offering of 3 cabbage rolls smothered in this awesome sweet yet savory full bodied sauce.

LEFTOVERS were even better and it was 3 days later!  Just added Chompies to my list of must-have comfort food destinations."}
{"text":"Been to this location at least half a dozen times. Typically pretty good food and service. Major disappointing experience today however. Our order got \"lost\" and we waited nearly an hour for our breakfast. When we did get our food, several dishes were cold. Thankfully our 3 kids, ages 18 mos to 6 were well behaved. Although the manager acknowledged the error, we were not offered a discount or even a free cookie. Will be awhile before we return."}
{"text":"Here's the deal, this place is great, but, they do not handle large groups of people with takeout orders well. Call in advance. Save yourselves. We had a team of 40 hungry athletes, on game day, come at 7:15 to put their orders in, all they ordered were bagel sandwiches with eggs. There was one man, one pan, individually making all of the eggs. It took beyond forever. It is now 8:33 am and only half of the team has been fed. They forgot some orders. We have a game at 11 am. The whole team is mad, coaches are mad. I repeat, do not bring large groups here for take out without calling in. Our team will never come here again.

Update, been an hour and a half, waiting on 7 more orders.

Fire the cashier, she's an idiot.

Officially been here for  an hour 45 minutes, I'm the last one to get my bagel. 

 Never have I ever been in a bagel place for an hour and 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Great service, but the food was just okay.  The sliders were really greasy, and the chopped steak was not a steak, but rather a large ground beef burger patty,  for which I was not pleasantly surprised.  I liked the bread here the most - the challah bread was pretty decent, and the bread basket with the toasted bagel slices and rye bread were good.

We came in as a group of 40 people, and they were patient, allowing us to split the bills several ways, as well as getting us our food and refilling our water in a timely and friendly manner.  Warrants an additional star to the 3-star rating I would have given for the food."}
{"text":"Disappointing that food quality gas declined over the years. Had a breakfast today, husband's over easy eggs were slimy, sausage was tasteless, latke was well done and onion bagel burnt to a crisp. Coffee was like water. Used to love this place."}
{"text":"Went there this morning I had a waffle which was good it also came with two smallish turkey sausages which were cold the waitress was right there so she hurried them back to the kitchen and returned  in a moments time with the warmed sausages in the mean time when I took a bite of my eggs they were also ......we will say not hot by any means and not over medium like I requested  my wife had one of there scrambles with potatoes bacon onion which she said she liked it said it came smothered in gravy but it was not smothered  and  in her case she said she preferred it as is ...I have always liked there lox,bagel,tomato,ect if and when I return that is what I will stick with they seam to have that dish down"}
{"text":"Meat..fried potatoes...gravy. 
Three of my favorite things in the world and the do them all oh so well here. I typically come here for the Jewish sliders but every now and then I mix it up and get something different. But those sliders? Phenomenal. The beef is so tender it basically falls off the sandwich. The rolls the come on have the perfect amount of sweet to compliment the saltiness of the meat, cheese, and gravy. The little potato pancake they put on the sliders gives a nice crunch and compliments the flavors of the rest of the slider perfectly. Oh man and the brown gravy?It's definitely something I'd smother my food in on a daily basis if I weren't trying to watch what Im eating. All in all I am always a happy camper when I visit chompies."}
{"text":"Feel good kind of place. Not too loud. Menu is huge and can probably satisfy just about any craving. Famous for the Jewish Sliders (man v/s food). Pastrami fans must come here. Place is well organized and clean. They even have a full bar if you want to have a drink and watch sports on the 2 tv's hanging above the bar. They have an amazing selection of homemade cake and pie that you can order by the slice. Service was perfect. Thank you Jordan for the amazing service."}
{"text":"Dude.  They have Dr. Brown's Cel Ray.  'nuff said.

This place is an oasis; I don't care how cheesy it looks."}
{"text":"They carry all of my favorite staples except for kreplach, which is a good start. The Holland Tunnel sandwich was great, and I'll probably try the Lincoln Tunnel next time. The Jewish slider is worth adding to a meal to try, but a full order of 3 might be a bit much. The knish have a very thin, flaky crust, and actually stand up pretty high on my knish scale. The potato pancakes were nothing impressive, and the pierogi were very heavy on the oil, which made it difficult to taste the potato filling. There's a GREAT bakery selection here with all of the musts: babka, black & white cookies, bow tie cookies, rugelach, Mandelbrot... Definitely going back to stock up on the baked goods."}
{"text":"Chompies is great. I always get the Breakfast Bagels Skins which are a breakfast version of potato skins. They are delicious and I always have enough to take home. Another goodie is their sweet potato pancakes."}
{"text":"My family loves this place! We go here at least once a week and even our 7 year old will say that it is his favorite place to eat. They have an extensive menu, full of delicious options. Their portions are generous and if you have a child with you, they will ask at the end if they can give your kid a cookie. Also, we love the customer service! Beatriz (the hostess) greets everyone as if they are family. She is so friendly and remembers familiar faces... often greeting people with hugs and asking about your day. All of the servers are fantastic... but two of them that really stand out are Don and Ashley. They always provide exceptional service that is incomparable to anywhere else we go. We have had them many times and they are always consistent with their great customer service. This is our favorite place to eat. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"It just would not be a trip to Arizona if I didn't stop at Chompie's for their Yummy Stuffed French Toast (please note- \"Yummy\" is part of the name, and not a descriptive adjective added by me).   Today, I decided to break tradition and get a sandwich, instead.


Oh why, oh why, did I not order a half of a sandwich? 

The portions are ridiculously huge, here.  But you have to remember that the prices fit the portions.  I don't think this is the cheapest place by far, but you do get what you pay for. 

Considering all of my visits to Chompie's are always 6+ months apart, I can't really comment on the service. In my memories, it has been hit or miss, but mostly hit.  And, like everyone says, the decor is a little cheesy, but this place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Chompie's is always delicious and has such a huge menu that it's hard to get bored.  Whenever I'm sick, I always crave their Chicken Matzo Ball Soup. It is nice that you can pick it up to go when you don't feel like eating out."}
{"text":"The pickles are the best part!

Whether you get breakfast, lunch or dinner the food is always good and the service is decent. 

I wish they had more non-breakfast vegetarian options besides vegetarian chili (it's not that great)."}
{"text":"I had been very curious about trying Chompies and when I saw Man vs. Food I knew I had to go. The Jewish sliders were good, not great. The brisket was tender and the bun was soft, yet I was still looking for something to make it worth the small fortune I paid for this lunch. The carrot cake is exceptional! I will go back for the bakery definitely, and maybe for the deli. I would like to try the corned beef or pastrami."}
{"text":"So, why does anyone eat here? If this is a true representation of New York style deli... I never want to go have real New York deli. I am sitting here waiting for our check (still) full of sadness and disappointment."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've been going here off and on since 1998 or so, usually while on vacation (since 2000). The menu and the food have changed over the years, but the general quality is still there. This last visit I got the Brooklyner, which has corned beef, pastrami, and braised brisket. I finished most of it, but could have finished all of it if I tried. I know some people expect these huge mile-high sandwiches (like in NYC) but I've been to some of those delis and they charge $20 for a sandwich. So the sandwich may be bigger but you still pay for it. Anyway, $13.29 is a bit pricey for a sandwich, but this sandwich had a really excellent taste to it. Mike T. got a beef tongue sandwich, which was equally tasty. Both were admittedly a tad on the small side considering the price, but I think that's a minor point.

Chompie's is unique in that it doesn't just focus on the deli elements, they do traditional breakfasts, some Mexican food, burgers, crepes, wraps, there's something for everyone here. I think it generally fits the transient mindset of the Phoenix area, where most everyone isn't from there, they're either just passing through or ended up there by a set of circumstances. You could view this trait as a big minus and say that Chompie's doesn't match up to a traditional NYC deli (which it doesn't). But like a lot of other restaurants in the area, I think its strengths are that it continues to try new things with the menu and it tries to just create good food and atmosphere without being confined in a box.

Now on the menu they have 5 pounds of sliders for 50 bucks or so, it's free if you can finish in half an hour. That doesn't appeal to me, but it's just an example of a restaurant that isn't afraid to try something new while keeping their classic dishes in tact."}
{"text":"Why do you have to be a \"hippie\" to eat turkey sausage? Wtf is wrong with Phoenicians? So out of touch with so many aspects of life. Many who decide to put their head firmly up their butt everyday before they leave the house. This is why if you're originally from the Valley i wont even began to consider a rational review of your narrow-minded taste."}
{"text":"My daughter stopped in for lunch on Saturday and I got some HUGE double decker turkey sandwich....even though I think it's a bit pricey......you get ALOT of food for that money. You're not walking away from Chompies hungry by any means. Daughter had chocolate chip pancakes.....good....but it's kind of hard to screw up pancakes. Right on ASU campus."}
{"text":"My family came here before our flight back Detroit. Would not seat our party of 11 until all were present. Not the cleanest of places but it is a Diner.  Kids meals don't come with a drink so add another $3 for a coke.  Wife and I had the sliders which were good.  Brother in-law asked for soup instead of fries but was an add of $3 on top of his $15 Brooklyn sandwich.  Sliders could have been served with more gravy but I didn't dare ask for more or another $3 add.
The prices were on the high side ($145 for 6 adults and 5 kids),  Overall this was better than grabbing fast food before a flight.
Free Bagel for Yelp check in is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Definitely, top 5 worst customer service. Too bad they have great bagels and reasonable prices, but horrible customer service. Never, ever will I waste my money here."}
{"text":"Upgrading my review to a four star. Keep coming here for their wonderful omlettes today's was the Mushroom and Onion. Still can't believe these are just a three egg omelette as they are huge. Service has improved and today was a great example two different people were checking up on me and the coffee cup never ran dry. One thing though they still can't get the toast right. Today's toast was not toast at all more like slightly warm bread. Had to send back the toast and the waiter agreed with me that I needed \"real\" toast. Also they still only bring out rock hard little tubs of butter. Guess if the toast is hot or even toasted the hard butter will melt. 
All in all still love this place for breakfast and will be back, but hey work on the toast."}
{"text":"At Chompies probably for the last time,been going there for years.But for the last couple of years the service has been atrocious I'm not exaggerating it's just my wife and me and believe it or not they haven't gotten an order right ever.The help first thing to go on a place going downhill."}
{"text":"Service sucked, bagels weren't fully cooked, no guidance walking in, no greeting."}
{"text":"Eat at Chompie's on Friday for lunch after my mom and was released from Banner hospital in Phoenix on our way home to Tucson.  Ordered lots of stuff to take home from the deli and bakery.  Even though my mom was tired and sore she had to get Chompie's while in Phoenix.  We also eat at the Phoenix location the night before her surgery. Wish there was a Chompie's in Tucson so it wasn't just a place we went on rare occasions."}
{"text":"Terrible service every time I've been there and the last time I went, I was ravenous. I waited 20 minutes sitting on the sidewalk b/c they have no waiting area to speak of. They finally called me and when I stood up, the hostess refused to seat me b/c my friend wasn't there yet!!

I told her she was on her way and that I was going to order & eat immediately. She didn't care. I asked her if she would be giving me a different size table if I was by myself and she admitted she wouldn't. Again I asked her what the problem was and demanded to be seated. She just kept saying over and over again that it was their policy and that she would not seat me until my friend arrived in another 15 min. 

I was furious! She knew I walked in by myself and sat there right in front of the door by myself reading a book--so why didn't she say something before I wasted all that time?

Additionally, my friends went there about a week prior. After they finished eating they continued to study together for an exam. The place was dead, so it's not like they were taking up tables. The manager actually came over and told them they had to leave b/c they weren't buying anything!!

I will never ever go back there. The food is decent, but sure as heck not worth the poor management and poor service!"}
{"text":"Meals and service are always great!   This has become the only choice for breakfast!   I'm starting to find my way there for lunch and dinner too. 
So many choices and the staff genuinely cares"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, received outstanding service from Robby.  The deli food is New York style and delicious!  The cannoli was fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"Visited at 5pm to order food to go.  Sat at the bar and waited to order and have a beer while waiting for the food.  Bartender was having  an extended conversation with patrons at the bar.  When he finally came to me, I told him I wanted to order food to go and have a beer.  He said okay, then disappeared for 10 minutes.  Chompies was not busy.  My family and I eat here regularly. So, I get up and go to the bakery to order food.  Gentleman  ahead of me is line is equally frustrated.  Shaking his had because service  is so slow.  He wanted 3 bagels.  He was becoming  quite loud.  So loud that some employees finally came to assist.  Purpose of this review  is to point out some deficiencies in customer service - at the bar and take out counter.  I do love the food."}
{"text":"Though I love this restaurant, I have experienced trouble with the hostesses before. Usually they're nice but one time when my family and I went to eat, she was being incredibly rude when it came to seating us. Haven't gone back since."}
{"text":"This place is fine. They bring pickles to you, which I was initially excited about, but they weren't very sour or salty. Weak pickles. I was with my Girlfriend and she said they make their own pickles, but there was something kind of bitter about the brine. 

It did bring be back to the typical diners of NYC. The waitress was rushed, kind of rude, which is again typical for NYC. Still, at least in NY people have an excuse to be rude. She still got her full tip, but when I give my order I don't like to be rushed.

I had the crunchy chicken wrap, but I ordered it buffalo style with a side of blue cheese. I thought \"buffalo style\" meant it would come actually on the wrap, but when my plate came out it was just the wrap plain with a cup of hot sauce. ..so not buffalo style. Very disappointing. Mediocre to taste too. 

The atmosphere is meh. The worst part was the gross fluorescent lights over every table. It's way too bright in there. I probably won't ever dine in again."}
{"text":"First time here, received my order and it was wong. They corrected it, but I ordered pastami with melted cheese and it was cold. I wont be going back."}
{"text":"Decent food but poor guest service upon my first visit. Not a very welcoming atmosphere. Waitresses need to brighten up...."}
{"text":"You'd think you were in NYC. Great selection of deli favorites and more for breakfast lunch and dinner. I'm a fan of the New Yorker w/ pastrami. The best bagels in Phoenix area."}
{"text":"My favorite place and I get the best breakfast bagel :) The staff's friendly and they always know what I want. AMAZING!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a fantastic sandwich and they have a nice bakery too with cookies and breads.  I ordered Aaron's Choice (hot corned beef & pastrami, Swiss cheese, coleslaw and 1000 island dressing on an onion roll) and it was fantastic.  Two others in our group ordered the Original Jewish Sliders (mini challah rolls filled with moist lean brisket, mini potato pancakes, and jack cheese with a side of gravy) and they could not eat them fast enough!  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Love the food but hate the high prices, Had the Pastrami Sandwich and it was good, staff was friendly and pretty knowledgeable when it came to the huge menu. Great place for some good food."}
{"text":"Chompie's is a good, albeit somewhat pricey, sandwich and slider place. I've heard it's just like a Jewish deli in New York, something I can't exactly attest to as I've never eaten at a Jewish deli in New York. I can attest to my meal today.

I started it off with a black and white chocolate soda shake, which was good--it's hard to make chocolate soda taste good, but this one was. 

I followed it up with a hot corned beef (only half, though) with sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were nice and crunchy, and the corned beef was good on its rye bread. 

My wife had the sliders and gravy with potato wedges - the gravy had a good home-cooked quality to it, and both of the meats were seasoned appropriately."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is excellent, service is always top notch, and their bagels are amazing!"}
{"text":"Crappy service and just meh food. Our server was terrible and managed to screw up two out of three orders. When we ordered and ask for something specific we were told you can have anything you want... until he brings it to your table with exactly what you asked not to be included on top of your food. We won't be back and absolutely wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Love the Monte Cristo and the Jewish Sliders are very tasty."}
{"text":"Chompie's is always a good idea. The native New Yorker/bagel/pastry lover in me is always satisfied when I come here. Today's experience was nothing less than great. My bf and I came in around 5:30 PM and sat at the bar which is always open seating. We weren't too hungry but needed to have dinner and because our resolution is to make \"healthier\" choices when eating out, so we went with the crispy chicken salad (has a more specific name but I can't remember). I told our server we were sharing and when it came out, it was surprisingly split in 2 generous dishes. This made me wonder how huge the salad is unsplit because our respective dish filled us both! And the salad was deliciously made with fresh greens, tomatoes, corn, cheddar cheese topped with breaded chicken and their famous onion strings (my favorite part of it!). It comes with chipotle ranch and we were accidentally served with regular ranch on the side so I asked for the chipotle ranch which has a much tastier flavor in my opinion. I do love everything and anything chipotle. Our server was nice and attentive. After our quick dinner, I looked through the pastries to buy some whole wheat bread to take home. I also picked up the black and white cookie for dessert to-go. It is sweet goodness! A huge sugar cake cookie with half chocolate and half vanilla (I think) icing. The cookie itself to me has a slight lemony flavor to it. Yum!! All good things, all good things."}
{"text":"Bad service. We love visiting man vs food restaurants . We drove from Las Vegas to eat at this place. The soda machine was not turned on . the service was bad and UNFRIENDLY. SPECIALLY TO FAMILIES WITH KIDS .. I hope the owners have the decency to respond to my review. what a disappointment."}
{"text":"We tried Chompie's the last time we visited Phoenix and fell in love. So much, in fact, we went twice during our short stay--once for dinner, once for breakfast. For dinner, I ordered Glen's Braised BBQ Brisket, which was amazing--perfectly tender with a yummy slightly sweet, slightly spicy barbecue sauce. For breakfast, I tried the Chompie's Benedict with a latke. The latke was so crispy; one of the best I ever had. The Benedict itself was HUGE, the eggs nice and runny, and the ham thick and delicious.  Their mixed drinks are also great: affordable and strong. We were extremely happy with the service too. When one of us ordered the Chicken in the Pot to go for dinner, the server provided us with extra containers to put the soup in, just in case we didn't have a bowl in our hotel room. The server for breakfast was also very friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back next time we're in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Want great food? This is the place! I was originally turned on to Chompie's when I saw it on Man Vs Food and I have been back multiple times. The Original sliders are the best! They are full of flavor and you will be more than satisfied with the taste and amount of food offered.

I have had all the sliders and Original are the best. That said, you can't go wrong with any of their breakfast choices, but the stuffed french toast is more like a dessert than anything.

Delish... Takes me back to NYC..

If you're not sure about the sliders then go on Tuesdays when they offer the all you can eat sliders for $9, but good luck putting down more than 4!"}
{"text":"Had a friend tell me that this place was great!  I went there this morning for breakfast.  We have been meaning to go.  Was so not inpressed.  Service had something to be desired.  My benedict was cold, and pretty bland. 2 average meals, sm oj and milks for 35.00.  Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Restaurant looks great, lots of space, friendly service and extremely quick kitchen. Maybe it was because we were there on a Thursday at 3:30pm so there wasn't much traffic, but signature Jewish Sliders we ordered came out in less than 15 minutes.

I found out about this place from the Man v Food episode and the sliders looked amazing online. Finally trying them myself I have to say they were pretty good but didn't live up to the hype, I would give them 3.5/5. The gravy sauce or ranch dressing is necessary for the slider otherwise it won't have too much flavor. The meat is cooked beautifully and fairly tender. The onion strings side were fantastic (4/5) and go really well with the ranch sauce. We also ordered one Western style slider just to try and I ended up liking that one more. We also got a mini carrot cake, which I would give a solid 5/5. The food + service and speediness which I would give  5/5 compels me to give this place 4/5 overall."}
{"text":"Best corned beef sandwich that I have ever had. My wife and children all left full and completely happy!!! What a pleasure to enjoy a delicious meal in a nice atmosphere that makes you feel like you are back home. We will be regulars for sure!!! Thank you"}
{"text":"I am in heaven. Been seeing this place advertised. Finally made it.  Yeah!!!!!
Just wonderful"}
{"text":"3 stars for the food (I'm a deli snob from NY and the rye bread fell apart with the Russian dressing on it long before I could get to the 2nd half of the sandwich). However, 5 stars for my server, Aubrey, who did a PHENOMENAL job of providing outstanding customer service. GIVE THAT WOMAN A RAISE !!!"}
{"text":"This is a true find.   Try the pastrami/corned beef/brisket knishes and the matzah ball soup."}
{"text":"Wow.  What a find in AZ.  The meat knishes are amazing. One of the best delis in the US.  Better than the popular ones in New York by far."}
{"text":"Very poorly managed restaurants with no sense of urgency in and sadly in need of new young blood"}
{"text":"I had heard positive things about this place so when I found a Groupon for this place, I knew we had to try it out.  This place was a complete let down.  

We went for lunch one day hoping for a quick bite to eat.  This place was packed, but it was no excuse for how bad it smelled.  It smelled terribly (like stinky feet).  

The brought out some 'fresh' pickles as a starter for the meal.  The pickles tasted like cucumbers.  They had not even started the pickling process yet.  I only ate them because I was starving at that point, but normally I would have passed completely.

The service at this restaurant was downright embarrassing.  Our waitress was in pajamas...I am not joking.  She came to our table two times, one to take our order and the other when she finally dropped off the check (after hunting down another employee to get it).  When we showed her we had a Groupon, she acted as if we were asking her super tasking, almost a personal favor.  We received more service from the other staff than our own waitress.  

The portions were really small, especially for the price.  11-13 bucks for a sandwich, I expect it to be decent.  I have been to MUCH better sandwich joints that were more affordable.

With awful service and mediocre food, I do not think I will ever come back."}
{"text":"Terrible Service!  We decided to try Chompie's for the first time. When we walked in the restaurant was moderately busy. With our party of four we went up to the hostess and asked to be seated. The hostess told us that they were getting ready to close early for Passover and that we could either sit outside on the patio or at a high top in the bar.  I told her that neither of those would work since we have an elderly member in our party and a toddler. She said sorry, so we began to walk out.  As we were walking out the couple that was behind us at the hostess stand was being taken over to a booth to be seated. I looked around the entrances and there was absolutely nothing saying that they would be closing early.  Later that evening I called the hostess and asked what time they were closing and she said they were open until 9pm."}
{"text":"Brought the family here for the first time. We heard good reviews on Chompies as a company. So I ordered the hot pastrami and my wife ordered a specialty rueben and soup. My daughters ordered the mac and cheese and a burger. Well their order came out correct. Was not sure ok my wife and mine. My pastrami was not hot and my wife's reuben was hot - it actually was a pastrami sandwich. Not knowing how they serve it, we just ate it anyway. Also to add the Jewish rye for the hot (so called) hot pastrami was falling apart. Not more than 15 minutes of leaving the place my stomach started to hurt and I had to use the restroom. Safe to say we will not be dining here or other locations anymore. It's weird how one location can ruin it for all the other locations."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 dozen sandwiches and a cookie tray for a luncheon I was catering in my home to introduce my new grandson to my friends. I was extremely nervous about my order. Christopher was very helpful in helping me choose the sandwiches I would need for 16 women. The day before pick up, Brian called to go over my order and explain the presentation. He called a second time to verify pick up time. When I went to get my order, it was just as I had hoped. The cookie tray looked amazing and the sandwich trays were nicely done with a generous portion of meats. They included another tray with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions and mayo and mustard and silverware. I cannot recommend Chompies enough. It was perfect."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner on Friday night.  We ordered the mish mosh soup and I had the soup and sandwich combo with a pastrami sandwich and chicken kreplach soup.  The sandwich was hearty and good.  Both soups were served barely lukewarm.  We called the waiter back and he had the mish mosh soup warmed up.  The matzah balls, kreplach, and noodles were tasty, but there was only one tiny piece of chicken and an overabundance of carrots.  The manager walked by and asked how things were.  When we said that both soups were cold, he basically nodded and moved on to the next table.  Why ask if you aren't interested or are going to ignore the feedback.
We usually enjoy the restaurant's corned beef, pastrami, and potato pancakes,"}
{"text":"It is difficult writing a review.  This restaurant changes in quality, portions and pricing quite frequently.  I have to say that I do enjoy the food, but the prices are expensive, too expensive - it is NY style deli!  A sandwich with an ice tea after tip is closing in on $20.00.

The staff are hit and miss; some good, some have these artificially less than genuine NY style bad ass attitudes - too funny!

The corn beef, pastrami and turkey is all good as is the cole slaw.  The desserts are simply fantastic.  Again, a piece of 7 layer cake for $5.00 or so is not something I care to remember or repeat.

I am probably one of the few that miss the atmosphere of the old location on Greenway.  The new location is just to artificial and kitsche.  

The wait in line can be frustrating - the greeters tend to deflate the actual wait times - try it with a three year old.

The food is good, but don't choke when you get the check."}
{"text":"Since I am giving the review, I give 4 stars. My mom was in town visiting and she gave it 5 stars. All of the familiar New York deli food are featured. Large amount of choices on the menu for breakfast and lunch. Healthy and gluten-free options are available. Best bagel I have had in Arizona. Friendly and prompt service. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm normally not a huge breakfast fan, but Chompie's never disappoints! Their menu is basically a giant book with options for any appetite. On my last visit, I ordered Granny's Skillet which was served with an Everything Bagel and cream cheese on the side- basically a meal in itself. I had ordered it with gravy on the side so sadly it was too dry for me, but maybe some salsa would have helped. The restaurant was packed, but that didn't affect the service time which is a win in my book! The day old bread they sell is amazing and be sure to stop by the bakery for a treat to go before you leave."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing blintzes are so yummy filled with ricotta cheese and their corned beef sandwich is amazing. Only order half of it because its a HUGE sandwich! 
Their servers are really good too, very nice and helpful!
Their desserts in the display cases look so delicious!!! 
My husband and I will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always busy.  We had our Mom's 90th birthday party here. Wait staff go above and beyond! The matza ball soup is exceptional.  Great breakfast, lunch, and dinner items.  The baked goods are delicious.  You have to try this place!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Waited over 15 minutes just to order a drink. They had costumers but not over busy for as long as it took.  Was getting ready to get up and leave.  Heard  the food was great.  Had Jewish slider combo.  It was good but the krephel soup was cold when it came out and had huge carrots and celery and only one krephel in the entire bowl.  Very disappointed.  Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Chompies is my go to for bread! They have some that are low in carbs! Also decided to buy some thing from the bakers for Mother's Day and from what I hear it was pretty delicious. Also, decided I eat in the restaurant and Had an omelette with a bagel and I can't complain. It was great! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"This location has gone down hill. The service is awful and the employees are not caring or friendly. I placed an order on the phone for one slider special and a pound of corned beef. The person taking the order was not helpful, did not know the menu and was completely rude. When I arrived at the restaurant I waited a few minutes before someone helped me. I told them I had a carryout. After a few more minutes the employee came out and said they did not have any corned beef and it would take awhile to prepare. She said the corned beef was in the pot and would take some time to finish. She ask if we wanted to come back or order something else. Why did she take my order on the phone and not tell me at that time they had no corned beef. Having me drive there and then stating they do not have any is ridiculous. They have lost a valued customer and I cannot recommend this location."}
{"text":"I always eat at Chompies, but it was my first time at this location. Needless to say I was not impressed. It's a lot smaller than their other locations, so we decided to sit out side. It was great that they had misters, but they need to turn them down because I was getting soaked! At all the other locations I've been to, the first thing the server does it usually place a basket of bread in the center of your table and take your drink orders. No bread. I asked the server if bread was no longer complimentary and she said it wasn't, but offered to bring us out some pickles (Which she should have done in the first place, in that case). Pickles were not something that I was dying to eat as an appetizer. Next, we looked at the menu. What a jumbled mess! The selection is awesome, but they had stuffed WAY too many items on a single page. I ordered the stuffed cabbage and when it finally came out, it wasn't as good as I was expecting. It tasted way different than it did at the other location. The meat was super bland, and kind of grayish. Needless to say, I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"This is the legitest bagel joint in Tempe... 

Lox and Bagel all the way baby."}
{"text":"Ordered Brisket on rye sandwich. The brisket was gray to almost white in color. Waitress apologized and took it back. I then decided to order corned beef on rye. That came out looking and tasting like half cooked and rubbery. Horrible. Sent that back and lost my appetite. Have eaten at Chompie's in Scottsdale several times and never disappointed. Here in Chandler total opposite."}
{"text":"Very busy...dirty, awful experience. Chicken soup should be called Salt and Chicken soup.. had to send fries back, cold..not to mention grease needs to be changed.  Bathroom was awful, mentioned on way out...like someone cared.  Save your money"}
{"text":"I have been to this deli many times in the past....obviously it was good enough to go back with family.  It was not good at all.  Wait to be seated...good...busy is a good thing.  The time from the order to delivery was more than 40 minutes and we had soup salad and what wound up being cold sandwiches.  The place emptied out and we were receiving the food st 2:45 in the afternoon.  Brisket was cold and dry, chicken soups were not warm and salty.  The server was either overwhelmed or out of his element.  Bad day, maybe..not a new restaurant...their attitude was ...pullemin seatem.....collect that money....no one watching this kitchen...lots of important people walking the dining room"}
{"text":"I had never heard of Chompie's until I saw it on Man vs. Food - they are famous and known for their Jewish sliders. They have the same Ultimate Slider Challenge that Adam Richman tried at the restaurant and everyone is open to challenge themselves.

We were only there for a late breakfast though so no food challenges for us ;) Chompie's has an extensive breakfast menu and it took me awhile to figure out what I wanted. Eventually I ended up ordering the two eggs any style (I had them scrambled) with homefries and a bagel. It was more than enough food! Everything tasted pretty good and the homefries had tons of flavor. The bagel was fresh and the cream cheese was very creamy. Pretty solid breakfast, no complaints! 

My boyfriend ordered the corned beef hash with potatoes and a bagel and he could barely finish it, but it was definitely yummy leftovers for later. His mom had the chicken soup with matza balls and she said it was one of the best she's had. It looked pretty good!

We didn't get to grab any desserts or grab anything from the bakery but everything looked delicious. Next time I definitely want to grab something to go!

Overall, Chompie's is a solid breakfast, lunch, and dinner spot. Everything on their menu sounds good and I can definitely see why people keep coming back."}
{"text":"The dinner was excellent the  dessert \"cheese cake\" was old and real hard to eat. They had to refund our cheese cakes because they also noticed how bad it was. My daughter had to spit it out"}
{"text":"Stopped in during an afternoon of shopping. The service was not that great...the food was ok but not noteworthy. Katella Deli, New York Deli, Canters and Phils at Farmer Market LA have nothing to worry about."}
{"text":"Not too busy at lunch time which is great for me since I'm usually on call at the hospital. The food here is tasty and fresh. The wait staff is very personable and did I mention the free pickles?"}
{"text":"We came an hour before close and were told the pickles were already put away for the night. They should close an hour earlier then!!! Waitress seemed distressed and over worked, however there were only 3 people in the restaurant. And my Reuben was nothing but fat and end pieces, was gross. I couldn't even eat it, and didn't. It looked like people's leftovers they threw on my sandwich. My mothers liver was overlooked too, tastes like rubber. We went to in n out on our way home from dinner to get something to eat. Very disappointed because this used to a regular place for us."}
{"text":"I have wanted to like Chompie's so much since I'd heard good things but most of my experiences have made this place mediocre, at best. 

There is seriously nothing-and I mean nothing-healthy on the menu. No vegetarian options, no whole wheat bread. Even the salads are all made with 90% iceberg lettuce even when advertised as \"crisp greens\". It's so easy to make a really good salad, I'm not sure why theirs suck so bad. On my most recent visit I got a bowl of split pea soup and it was probably the worst split pea soup I've ever had. Too salty and otherwise boring. 

The baked goods are pretty good, but it really depends on what you get. The bagels are not all that great, but the honey bran muffins are bomb. 

**Note: avoid visiting the University location which is riddled with loud, sometimes trashy college kids."}
{"text":"My boyfriend likes Chompies, says its been on food channels and is highly favored. My pancakes literally tasted like hot dogs.. as a vegetarian and pancake lover... not my ideal situation"}
{"text":"Today, I had one of the best tongue sandwiches in recent memory. I am a 73 year old NYer and have had my share of tongue on rye. This was a very large, buttery wonderful looking sandwich. And honestly better than the ones I have had in the PV shopping center.

Great service, nice ambience, altogether an unexpected and delightful experience.

One other thing, the server asked me if wanted cheese or lettuce and tomato with the sandwich. What the!

Arthur"}
{"text":"Chompie's has a huge menu. I suggest taking a look at it before going to the restaurant to decide if you want breakfast from the all-day breakfast service, a deli sandwich, traditional Jewish fare, or a hearty dinner. 

My husband went for the pastrami sandwich, while I ordered the Jewish sliders plate. It came with three sliders on challah bread, with brisket, potato latkas, cheese, and brisket gravy for dipping. They were delicious and hearty. My husband said his sandwich was just OK, and the pastrami was in need of salt.

My brother ordered the spinach omelet and also said it was just ok, and a little tough. He wasn't a fan of the omelet ingredients being piled on top of the eggs. Chompie's also has baked items galore, from loaves of braided challah bread to iced brownies. My niece got a decorated Minion cupcake and I took home a brownie. I would return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Well. Disappointing. 
I like chompie's bagels. I stop there often on the go but this yime we decided to sit there. A jewish family of four.  
Ordered scrambled and cheese for the little guy. Asked for turkey sausage. No bacon please. 
Kid got the plate. Has bacon. I chase the server and explain I asked for no bacon. Giving him the plate back and walking to my table. He comes after me and says so you want turkey sausage? I say yes. No bacon for us. 
He says oh okay, I'll just take it and grab the bacon from the plate with his hand!!! Beyond the shock I say : well ... it's a religious thing. I don't want bacon on his food please make a new one . He looked pretty surprised by my stand but walked away . 
After that it was just all mediocre.  Food was okay service not. Never got offered more coffee even. 
Would not recommend. What a shame letting it go like that."}
{"text":"If you have ever been to Katz's in NYC, Kaufman's in Chicago or Cantor's in LA you need to know right away , you will be disappointed ..this isn't that kind of Jewish Deli. 
Now if you haven't, this might be just fine for you. Located close to ASU I wonder if they just have given up trying to really show off how good it could be. maybe feeding the students and their out of town parents is just enough for the Chompies Family. But if they do want to attract locals to come in here are some ideas: 

Refill water glasses at least every 15 minutes, this is salty food; pickles, pastrami , chopped liver etc...give us some water...and if you see customers sucking on ice with an empty glass take the hint... 

give us a nice big bowl of pickles 4 pickles in an a 10 inch dish just looks silly...show us you care like a Jewish grandma and give us a decent amount .... 

When you say LEAN it means no big flabby pieces of loose fat dripping off the meat on every side. Lean would be the no visible trails of flabbiness. 

Do something about the fries...when the person next to you says , \"they taste okay when you put gravy on them\" you know they are just meh... 
If you are giving me fries ,make them decent ..it's not that difficult. 

Check on your table occasionally , taking the order and bringing the food and little else makes me wonder why we even need the waitress...I will go take the order and get the food and no need to tip me.... and I refill water glasses. 

Chompies has the potential to be more but who am I to tell them what to do?"}
{"text":"Solid NY style deli.  Reminds me of Katz in Houston.  Wish it was open 24 hours.

As for the food, the Rueben was the best I've had and their fries are bomb.

Black and white cookies are great and the rye bread even comes seedless."}
{"text":"My wife's latest strategy is to get me to drive her to the mall either during lunch or dinner time because she knows that I like Chompies. I am normally allergic to shopping and the malls. I have eaten at Chompies walk-up take out area every time I've been there. I order the #4, which is a bagel of your choice along with two scrambled eggs, diced ham, onions and green peppers with cheese. I add a soda to the order and it's around $5-$6 dollars.

Last time I was in there with my son they mixed up the bagels. He got my bagel, and I got his. He ordered something different so we had to surgically remove our bagels without dropping the middle part and make everything right. The surgery was a success and our hungry tummies were thankful."}
{"text":"The first time I dined at Chompies I was blown away at how extensive the menu is. I have enjoyed everything that I have ordered. This is my go to place when we get caught between that critical 6pm to 7pm time slot when a lot of restaurants have big waiting times. This is not a knock on Chompies, It just works out that way since their clientele seems to eat earlier in the day.

I've usually order their burgers or the pastrami. My son loves their chicken sandwich. My favorite is the whole pastrami sandwich. It's very tasty and probably the best pastrami I've ever had. It is a mountain of a sandwich. I usually eat half of it and finish the next day for lunch. I order the whole sandwich as opposed to the 1/2 sandwich, soup option since the soup always seems to spill on to the plate when it's being delivered to the table. I don't like soggy sandwiches.

They also serve breakfast items. So if you have that picky eater in your family, this place is definitely an option."}
{"text":"Someone from Chompie's took the time to read my Yelp Review, apologized to me and made things right.

But it was MIGHTY BIG that they addressed their staff and management about the issue I had.

I can go back to being a fan again and enjoy the tastiest Pastrami Sandwiches in Glendale, fine baked goods and the best take out lox there is in Glendale.

Thank You!"}
{"text":"This deli was very busy and energetic and was on a wait at lunch time when I went. I liked the fun New York Skyline and all the murals on the walls. Everyone from hostess to servers were very friendly and service was very speedy. They sat us at the romance booth. It was a cozy one sided bench booth.

Chompie's is famous in the area for their own fresh made in Phoenix breads and bagels.

In general the food was good but differed in taste to what I was expecting. Portions are very large and I brought home more than half of everything. I sampled three different meats between my half sandwich and my husband's sandwich. I thought they did the brisket better than the corned beef and pastrami. The brisket was moist and developed with lots of flavors. The corned beef was sort of mild and the pastrami for my taste was too smokey but I do note I am very sensitive to some smokey taste and a lot of people do like the pastrami more smokey. The potato sampler was three varieties of potato pancakes.They were very fresh and not greasy at all but I thought the spinach and sweet potato ones were very light with spinach and sweet potato so they were almost all plain. The soup lacked aromatics for me but did have nice big pieces of fresh carrots in it.

I did notice that they serve hand carved lox of the nova and belly variety. It is extremely hard to come by hand craved belly lox. I would get that next time.

While seated I noticed at a booth near where I was sitting pots of hot coffee were balancing on a tray on the top of a booth above someone's head. That seems very dangerous. What happens if the person seating there stretches or if children run by and accidentally hit the tray. I would not sit at a booth with pots of hot coffee balancing on a tray above my head. 

Three stars are positive that means A-OK and worth a try.

Some things they do better than other things in my opinion.

Watch out for the pots of hot coffee above the booths!"}
{"text":"We've bought their bagels a few times and my husband likes them but I do not.
That being said, I've been  wanting to try out their deli.  Being a huge sandwich lover I was looking forward to it.
Their prices come with a big sticker shock.  Not wanting to spend a ton and being that I wasn't starving, my husband and I opted to split a 'colossal' Reuben...at $17 for just a sandwich I had high hopes.  It was a good size, but I have had bigger sandwiches at nowhere near the same price point.  Throw in a side of sweet potato fries and our total for 1 sandwich was $20 plus tax.  Say whaaaaaat?!?!  
Now on to the taste....the Reuben was decent but it was stacked high with meat that was pretty dry.  Had hardly any sauerkraut on it which is what defines a good Reuben in my book.  The pastries looked really good but I didn't want to spend an additional $6 when I was unimpressed with the sandwich.
Very disappointing and I won't return."}
{"text":"We went to Chompie's after church on Sunday and arrived about 12:30.  The only reason that I am not giving Chompie's five stars is because after being seated, the wait for the food was long.  However, don't let that stop you from going.  The food is fantastic and worth waiting for.  I had bagels and lox and can't say enough about the smoked salmon.  It was tender and delicious.  The dish also came with sliced tomatoes (and they were actually juicy), cucumbers, red onions, lettuce and olives.  Other members of our family ordered the Biltmore Benedick - that tasty salmon on muffins, topped with eggs and a creamy white sauce - and the Chicago hot dog which has every condiment imagineable piled on top.  We ate tons of Jewish dill pickles while we waited for our food and asked for another plateful which was delivered to us ASAP.

I enjoy this Chompie's more than the one at Paradise Valley Mall because it has more personality.  Be sure to check out the baked goods behind the bakery counter!  They also sell day old bagels for a discounted price that would still taste great toasted.  Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable and checked on us often.

I haven't eaten at very many Jewish delis in NYC, but this is as good as my favorite deli in Philly."}
{"text":"Just went there yesterday and the guy behind the counter was so helpful and nice. My mom and dad had never had Jewish food before so he explained very politely what was in Knishes and even let us try things that we weren't sure about. Absolutely excellent customer service.

At first I thought that 8 bucks was a little much for take out soup but it was a generous serving and since it was the end of the day they threw in a matzo ball just because. It also came with an entire bag of bagel chips."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a while now and last night my husband and I both walked out saying the same thing \"this place is really inconsistent with its service \".  The food is normally great.  5stars for the Matzo ball soup and for the sliders.  But seriously, where is management in this location?  Every time we walk in it's an uncomfortable welcome.  When asked, we say 2 for dinner.  And rather than a \"please follow me\", they grab the napkin set and a couple of menus and start walking off.  We never heard nor know to follow until they turn around, annoyed that they had to call you to follow them.  And rather than asking at the counter if you would like a table or both, you are awkwardly asking as you are standing in the middle of the dining room.  

It's VERY apparent that management has not done their staff justice in proper service training which in turn lacks in the service to your customers.  

I encourage the owners and managers to help make this place shine!  Show pride in your establishment and reflect the respect you have for it.  Be a leader and share your knowledge with your staff to set them up for success!  Right now, your not doing them any good and this reflects on you directly.  

Don't know where to start, I'd be happy to come in and show you!  This location can and should be the greatest and I'd do anything to see it shine the way it should!"}
{"text":"Food is always great.  Service is always slow and terrible.  Call in and order ahead. Take it out. Go to the deli counter..anything but sitting at a table."}
{"text":"Yo. This place is fire. Jk. But this is our favorite place for breakfast, service is friendly and attentive (this applies to most of the employees). -Except for one time that they wanted me to throw away my drink from Starbucks, they said we couldn't have it in a Starbucks cup and wanted us to cover it up or throw it away, I didn't understand why but that was the only time this happened- 

Besides that incident i wouldn't have any other complaints. If you get in early you will usually get a free sample of their breads or muffins which are always yummy. They have a large selection of items and everything I've tried is good, just know that most of their entree's can be quite large (which is not a bad thing) so most dishes can be shared. 

Their deli also has great take home options, so if interested don't forget to go by!"}
{"text":"Oh my God, Chompie's is the bomb and I'm so happy to have a location so close to my house!

While this location has a steady customer base, I have never had to wait longer then five minutes to be seated, unlike the other location at 92nd Street, Win! Service has always been fantastic. Quick on to seat, quick to get drinks, quick on refills, and delicious food from breakfast to dinner items. As other reviewers have stated, the Jewish sliders are amazing, but I have also enjoyed different wraps and sandwiches. Prices are a little higher, but the food is well worth the money. There is a \"bar area\" with about six stools and two TV's that you are able to see from your tables/booths which usually has ESPN on. 

The restaurant itself is all decked out in a NYC theme, well lit, but the acoustics aren't that great so it can get a little noisy. Bathrooms are nice and always clean. Oh, and don't forget to check out their bakery for delicious goodies to take home!"}
{"text":"Yikes, this location is getting rough. I love Chompies, but I don't think I will becoming to this location anymore.

The last time I was here was on a Friday night, which happens to be a night when they have fish tacos and unlimited fish and chips and while the servers kept saying they were \"really busy\" we were sat right away while noticing other empty tables. The host took and delivered our drink orders letting us know that our server was taking a \"smoke break\", which I guess was nice because we knew it would be a bit before he came over. Anyway, we were able to figure out our entrees by the time our server got to us and my husband went for the Reuben sandwich and I went for the fish and chips, but then I was denied because \"they were out and it would take 30 minutes\". Bummed out, so I opted for chicken strips (kind of similar, right?). 

Our entrees were delivered and while my husband's plate was the standard we've come to expect, the chicken strips were something you would see at a truck stop diner. Not only were they tasteless and dry, but they were DISCOLORED. Like the discoloration you get from freezer burn. I was going to wait for our waiter since, traditionally they always check on you soon after entrees are delivered, but instead we had to flag down the busboy to get our waiter. When he arrived and we told him the disappointment, he stood there saying \"what do you want me to do, do you want to talk to a manger?\". No sympathy or embarrassment from the low quality meal, just confusion from him. Naturally, we said, \"yes, send the manager over\". Well, he had the same reaction, \"what would you like me to do?'. I don't know if this is the new way the food industry deals with issues, but I find appalling that they ask the customer what to do. I would think one would be embarrassed enough to take the plate away, offer a new version of the plate, offer a completely different entree, anything rather than \"what do you want me to do\" about it type attitude. By that time, 30 minutes had passed, so when it was up to us to decide what should happen after the terrible chicken strips, my husband suggested to fish and chips and the manager said \"okay\". 

When that meal arrived, I was blown away by the difference in both taste and appearance, why couldn't this had happened sooner? Ugh, anyway after we \"complained\" it seemed our drinks were to suffer with not being refilled and I also wasn't asked by the waiter if this meal was okay or any better.

The service was sub-par, but I did get to exchange my meal which was nice, but that was only after a horrible meal. I don't know about this location anymore. I don't want to come back."}
{"text":"My advise DON'T GO.
I have been coming here for years and the quality has gone down hill this year.  My main complaint is COLD food.  Hot food should be hot not cool.  Three strikes and they are out.  The last three visits have been especially bad.  My final visit their bakery case was empty which should have been my first warning.  Not empty from customers buying empty rather from they stop making/stocking.  When we sat down I decided I'll try something new on their menu \"Avocado Toast\" The \"toast\" was cold.  I waited patiently ~10 minutes for the waitress to return and ask if I could order something different.  I asked for a menu which took another 5 minutes then I ordered Oatmeal with Blueberries which she told me they don't serve after 11 it was 10:45 at this time which I mentioned and she said oh ok I can check but the blueberries are not fresh, so I said ok never mind I can take a hint.  I waited for my wife to finish her also not hot Eggs Benedict she is more forgiving than I.  When she was done we waited for at least five minutes before the waitress brought our check and during that time the table across from us had a chance to complain to the \"manager\" also about SURPRISE cold food he quickly began to berated the customer in front of the rest of us.  It was embarrassing that Chompie's has sunk so low."}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH! Felt like I was back in NYC! Ordered the Hot Pastremi and the Stevie B sandwich. They were both fantastic!! The fries and coleslaw delicious as well. Service was quick and friendly.  We will be back when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great food and baked good. I love the sliders the most and have always had good food. Hillary did a good job and was very polite. This place is one of the few reasons I still visit a mall."}
{"text":"Ok not much to say. Service was great, the variety of food is extensive! If you are indecisive like me, decide before coming to this restaurant. The location is perfect and convenient parking. I'd come here for all the people who want a all American restaurant and have a huge family to feed lol. 

My food was okay. I ordered a jalapeño chicken sandwich. It was meh. Lol I hated the sauce and the beard was nothing special, but this is nothing to do with the 'quality' of the sandwich, just not my preference. Anyway, nothing big about this restaurant that I'd tell others to come check out. 

Restaurant needs an update? Or maybe I'm too hipster for it haha. 

Anyway, overall: service was really good and the food was meh. 

Would I go back? Probably not. There are better restaurants that offer the same stuff. 

Sorry chompie"}
{"text":"I needed a Bloody Mary and food. Boyfriend and I had no idea where to go so we just ended up going to the mall first to wait for all the other brunch places to open than all of sudden, like light from the gods, Chompie's showed up. It was amazing! Best decision ever! Bloody was epic and the egg Benedict, do it! Love it! Safe to say, boyfriend and I found our brunch spot."}
{"text":"I love coming here for Saturday brunches and the bakery! This food reminds me of the great food of New York! Can't be beat!"}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars at this chompies and we absolutely LOVE it! The food is always top notch and staff could not be any friendlier! They are always so accommodating with my two young boys and treat us like family! The turkey sliders are my fav!"}
{"text":"Great food but overpriced. $16.99 for a sandwich, fries and coleslaw?? The dessert selection is phenomenal! Their Ruben sandwiches are amazing. Egg salad sandwich is very good. The Monte Cristo is very tasty. I suggest splitting a sandwich since the portions are huge. We are big eaters and were happy sharing. My kids both love it here. Would come here more if the prices were better."}
{"text":"We love coming to Chompie's for brunch on Sunday morning. This morning, Edward was our server. He was AMAZING. He was very attentive, he kept our coffee and water cups filled. He went out of his way to make sure we had the kind of creamer we wanted. He was also very mindful of interiority the conversation that we were having over breakfast. The food was amazing as usual. Thank you Edward!"}
{"text":"Love Chompies!! Have been going to the Paradise valley mall location for year. So very excited they opened one in Arrowhead mall. We have already been to this new location about 5 times and every visit is so delicious and service is amazing. Wouldn't change a single thing!!"}
{"text":"I think Chompie's has the best breakfast in town. The omelets here are really good and cheesy just the way I like em and the potatoes on the side are oh so tasty. I also love how they have every condiment you need on the table already. The breakfast is great but they also serve sandwiches, wraps, soup, salad, and Jewish cuisine like matzo ball soup and potato pancakes! I have tried a few things off the menu and I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Go to the Chompie's at Paradise Valley mall the service here is terrible and the food tastes different."}
{"text":"Wow, that is one loud annoying perpetual hum coming from their Refrigerated Cake Display. It really permeates the whole establishment and was very annoying.  Hope someone services that thing.  This location also has consistently slow service, but good food. But, there was better service in the take-out deli."}
{"text":"Tonights Elite event at Chompie's was great. As usual  the YELP squad did a wonderful job in setting up the event. Compie's owner was a great host and she made sure to visit all the tables. It was super to hear her and the restaurants history. They have been around for a long time and I am glad they now have a spot in the West Valley. We were treated to a variety of Chompie's goodies and everything was perfect. My favorite was the pastrami sandwich, although the desserts were fantastic. The bakery is a special place and one that I am sure is well used by those in the neighborhood as everything is fresh and tasty.  So, thanks again to Hailey for putting on a great event, finding another worthy eatery, gathering a fine group of Elites and carrying on the YELP tradition.  Bravo !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped here after attending a D-Back game. It was Sunday around 5:00pm. Not busy at all, we were seated very quickly. After waiting for a little time we were finally served water and asked for our drinks. Right away I asked if we can order one of their sliders so we can try it before our dinner. Waiter said no problem. Now their sliders are very good, It's like a whole meal in a bun! Don't know how anyone can eat their 12 sliders challenge! NO WAY!! Wife had their crispy chicken wrap, I had their all you can eat ribs. Wife's wrap was awesome! Very tasty, and her side dish of potato salad was just as good!! Their ribs were OK, not much meat, very fatty, even though I packed away 13 ribs!! Mom, it sounds worst than it is!! There just weren't that much meat! No wonder it's all you can eat! Now I am writing this review the next mourning and I can still feel the wrath of the ribs!! I will definitely go back. They have way too much items on their menu for us not to go back. But I will not longer order their ribs again."}
{"text":"Great sliders, come on all you can eat night!  Bakery is awesome, ribs are ok, free breakfast on your bday!  No clue how adam richman did the slider challenge, I wanted to cry after 10."}
{"text":"Great food.  Friendly waitresses.  It was not really crowded when we ate lunch here and it did take them a long time to get refills and such.  Love their bakery though :)"}
{"text":"Just finished a sunday breakfast/lunch here and it was pretty good. I ordered a strawberry banana smoothie to start as they had given out samples and my friends said it was really good. Took awhile to get them and when they arrived my friends were nice and creamy with a few chunks of ice where as mine was full of uncrushed ice cubes and large chunks making it impossible to use a straw and requiring me to chew.

I ordered a half corned beef half pastrami sandwich for my meal. Again it took a long time for the food to get to us and i understand they were busy but from what i have seen it was an average if not below average crowd for a sunday here. Got my food and I was slightly disappointed to see that rather than being half and half meat over the sandwich it was 2 separate halves one corned beef and one pastrami. It was easy enough for me to fix as with the large amount of meet i just split each half and mixed and matched. Just wish i would have been asked about this first.

The food was good and it is very good corned beef and pastrami, the potato salad is fairly bland. The rye bread is pretty good too. They do give a huge portion of meat which is nice. Also had a bloody mary which was good and had a nice spice to it.

Overall a decent meal but took a long time to get food and my smoothie had way to much unblended ice."}
{"text":"So, after a horrible experience I had from another place I decided to head to Chompie's Deli 

I loved the atmosphere it was good clean area I've heard about this place a lot first time trying this. 

As I once said before I love a good pastrami sandwich and I must say Chaompie's Deli has something here . 

Now am not saying it's amazing or the best, but it's pretty good for Arizona and when you order they give a massive sandwich as you see in the photo. 

It was definitely filling with a refreshing Dr Brown cream soda on the side it's a good combination. The pastrami was hot and fresh good taste too .. 

With the amount of meat / pastrami they put you can make two sandwiches , it was good. 

Service was good, fast and very friendly.  It's worth trying come on give it a go! 

I'll return again."}
{"text":"The menu is really, really long.  So, if you can't find something to eat that's amazing then it's your fault!  I got the turkey slider challah bread....it was not disappointing.  The service was fast and attentive.  But seriously, get the slider."}
{"text":"My husband and I have our favorite omelettes that we can eat anytime of the day!  Service is usually quick and pleasant. A great place to have breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"The quality is not what it used to be and service below average.
I m wondering if staff and management just don't care anymore.
Kids pancakes came out cold.  French toast was crispy on outside but not cooked on the inside.
Asked 3 times to have my water filled.
Definately have think twice before coming back for breakfast"}
{"text":"Would like to give this 2 1/2 stars ..the price is way out of line for what it is. Half a turkey sandwich and small potato salad $11 .it did have a lot of turkey on it but it was dry.tomatoes were way way way over ripe they were mushy yucky. Didn't care for the potato salad it was sweet. Pastrami half sandwich was quite fatty and dry also. Took  25 minutes to get this order to go.
Truly not impressed. it was clean,and staff were pleasant."}
{"text":"Decent bottomless coffee, lots of pastry/bagel variety, heaps of breakfast choices - lunch & dinner too, cafe/cafeteria-style atmosphere.

Tried their Biltmore Eggs Benedict when I met friends a recent Sunday and I applaud Chompie's inventiveness: lox instead of ham and accents of Havarti atop a bialy instead of an English muffin. The lox's saltiness overpowered the dish however, and I was genuinely disappointed. But it was still edible once my mouth adjusted to accommodate the high salt content. Said friends had fitness omelets & veggie sandwich - all looked & tasted wonderful (according to their reports).

Other faves are of course lox & bagel platter & blintzes. Service is efficient & friendly. Some visits better than others but overall a four-star establishment."}
{"text":"In town for 2 days, went to breakfast here 2 days, because it's my dad's favorite place.  First day I ordered savory - got latkes with poached eggs. Both were done very well -the eggs were poached medium, exactly as I had asked.  2nd day I got the bobka french toast...which is basically the crumb topping on a coffee cake, but on top of your french toast instead.  Freakin' delicious, I tell ya.  The menu is huge, there were 5 of us ordering very different items, and everyone was very happy with the 10 selections over the 2 days we came.  Service was great both days.  Two negatives: the portions are ridiculous - I asked if I could order a half portion the next time I came and the server said no; and they don't have good coffee - no capuccino - but the server on the first day was very sweet and said we were welcome to bring something in from the Starbucks (okay-not good coffee but better than the coffeepot weak coffee) which we could see right out the window in the shopping center.  She also seemed frustrated that they couldn't offer that option. So I like her for that :-)"}
{"text":"So, I give up as of today. This was once a standard bearer in quality and service, but in the past few months the ability to get what one orders has dropped to abysmal levels. I stopped in for a small order of 3 items. After prior disappointments I took the time to write them down and gave the gal behind the counter the list. She was a bit abrupt when reviewing the items with me, then made up the order. At home, I found all 3 were wrong and charged for extras were not there. I'm not sure what is going on here, but there are far too many great eateries in Scottsdale to be consistently disappointed and overcharged."}
{"text":"Hankering for Jewish deli food (as opposed to Italian deli, German deli, Polish deli, etc), my friend and I settled on Chompie's Deli for lunch today. We were attracted by the huge variety of food choices on the menu online. This location is across the street from the Chandler Fashion Mall. We were seated right away.

I had the soup and slider combo ($8.99). I chose the chicken noodle soup (average) and two Jewish sliders (excellent). The sliders were stuffed with tender beef brisket, cheese and a potato pancake on Challah bread rolls (also excellent). There were sides of a creamy cole slaw and brown gravy. I can't say the gravy added anything to the sandwich, so I ate one sandwich without the gravy and took the other sandwich home.

My friend had the corned beef Reuben mile high sandwich with cole slaw and fries ($14.99) and was only able to eat half of the meal and took the rest home. She loved the flavors, but found the mountain of meat daunting to eat. She ended up attacking it with knife and fork. 

When the server asked us if we would like some dessert we both looked at him like he was crazy since we both stuffed with just half the lunch. The dessert case was within eye shot and looked tempting, but alas no room left in the tummy for those temptations.

The theme of the food, decor, and menu seems to be New York City (I supposed because it hosts a plethora of Jewish delis). The seating is a little crowded, but the place seems clean. Service was good, but not very speedy (OK for this visit since we were not in a rush). Parking is plentiful and we found a spot close to the door. We would recommend this Chompie's deli and will likely return in the future."}
{"text":"I have been a chomped customer for over seven years but after today they have lost my business.  I went and today to a longer than usual line because their computers were down. I understand this is not the fault of the employees and I'm not writing them a one because of this. I am however give me the one because of the employees attitudes. The young lady behind the counter was beyond rude to the point that I almost just walked out of the restaurant.  She continues to be rude to everyone in line I waited 15 minutes to pay my bill got to my office and was so irritated I couldn't even enjoy my bagel. 

All this was happening while the manager was talking to another employee. 

Customer service is everything. Once it's gone you will lose customers no matter how good your food is."}
{"text":"I loveeee chompies. Came here for lunch and had the Rueben with fries. It was big enough to share and it was delicious. The meat is super flavorful and tender and they really pile it on. The fries were super hot and fresh and yummy. I've had breakfast also, which is amazing. The stuffed French toast- OMG. If you are really committed to eating breakfast, get this. It's huge and stuffed with cream cheese and strawberries and deep fried. It tastes like a funnel cake from the fair, maybe even better. The omelettes are all great too and they come with tons of food. You can get a bagel and cream cheese instead of toast which is a meal in itself. The only reason I am giving it four stars is the prices. For two sandwiches and an iced tea, the bill came out to $39. The sandwiches are huge but it's still a sandwich. If you go to the arrowhead location, they have a weekday breakfast special for two huge pancakes, bacon, and eggs for $4.99."}
{"text":"While at the Tempe Chompie's, I had a very plain tasting  \"Matzo Brei,\" that even syrup and salt couldn't flavor up. The Black and White cookie was pretty bad too. It had a lemon flavor, and the black or white side tasted good at all. A young staff, probably because it's right near ASU.

I couldn't believe Chompie's was this bad, so I went a second time in Scottsdale and had their \"Original Jewish Sliders.\" The Sliders were pretty good, and the gravy was excellent. More than anything, I liked the inventiveness of the ingredients. This experience changed my view. An older staff, probably because it's in Scottsdale. :)

I should have lowered my expectations based on the overall Yelp score, but a friend said it was the best deli in the Phoenix area. It probably is, but that doesn't say much. It's not even in the same stratosphere as other major cities."}
{"text":"The customer is NEVER right. 
That is what the manager of Scottsdale branch of Chompie's  seems to believe.
We asked for a refund on our chicken noodle soup and were very patronized and told how wrong we were.
Despite diluting it with a quart of water the sodium level would not reduce. Once wonders even what their sodium product was.
He gave an explanation that even defied basic cooking and patronized us greatly.
We were/are very offended and will never recommend this place to others.
We were treated horribly and will never return."}
{"text":"We came in today for brunch expecting a good experience based on other reviews. 2 adults and a baby in our party. What we got was ignored. We put our name in and were told 10 to 15 minutes.....we waited and watched as people who came in after us were seated...groups of 2, 3,4,6 were all seated before us....all coming in after we had. My husband let the host know and she shrugged and said she'd find a spot. The only place she had was in a high traffic area where the high chair would be at risk of getting hit.....she said that's the best they had. We said we'd be ok to wait a few minutes for a table where we could safely put a high chair. They sat another group of 3 and a group of 4 at tables that would have worked for us....and another group of 3 who had come in right after us who also got skipped over multiple times and ignored. We ended up leaving and going to U.S. Egg where we are always treated well. The other family left too. I will NEVER go to Chompies again. That was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. I highly suggest you find a different restaurant if you want to be treated with basic human respect. The worst thing a restaurant can do is ignore customers."}
{"text":"For what it is... it's ok. I've been to much better Jewish Style delis, but to my knowledge, you sadly won't find much better in Arizona.  Scott's Generations is my usual preferred Jew Deli of choice, but I find myself at Chompie's much more often. They are quick and convenient, but terribly overpriced for the portions and quality.

I will say though... I love their baked goods."}
{"text":"It was nothing special. The hot pastrami sandwich, which everyone supposedly raves about wasn't very hot, and basically pastrami on bread. It was lacking anything special to make it a good sandwich. I had a cannoli for desert. The filling was good buy the pastry shell was soggy and soft. I also thought they were over priced."}
{"text":"A classic! I come here whenever I'm in Phoenix. Among the best NY style restaurant delis anywhere, definitely superior to anything in the Bay Area.

We might have breakfast every day here. The bagels and lox are outstanding."}
{"text":"Got the western sliders, took over 25 mins to receive my food. It wasn't busy at all but still took that long. After receiving my food and drink, server never asked how my meal was and never refilled my soft drink. I'm not one to complain but I'll never go back again. Definitely not worth it, I've received better service at McDonald's!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with visiting family last night.  At six pm only three tables in the whole restaurant.  Service was slow and not everything was delivered as ordered.  In my view was a broom leaning against a wall.  Kind of felt like they wanted to close before we even got there."}
{"text":"We have always gone to the Chompies at Paradise Mall, but we decided to go to the Chompies on Shea. 
We didn't realize it was there till coming up the freeway noticed it near our house. 
As always the food was good, but our service was horrible. After being seated, we waited 10 minutes for a glass of water. I could understand if the restaurant was busy, but that wasn't the case. Our server, Ray, finally came to the table, slapped the water down and gruffly asked if we were ready to order. We asked for coffee first and he left. Waited longer and when the coffee arrived he almost left again and we told him we were ready to order. He took the order and left. Now keep in mind the restaurant wasn't busy, we had to ask a busboy for more coffee. 
Our food came out and as always, very good. 
We will go back, but will NOT sit in Rays' section."}
{"text":"Why didn't I discover this place before? I've been here over 10 years in Tempe!  I needed to find a new breakfast place because i did not want to go to Waffle House.  So glad I finally tried this place because the portions are huge, the prices are just right, the menu is deep, it's real and the kids love it since they get a full size cookie decorated with rainbow sprinkles with each kids meal.  The kids had pancakes and mac and cheese and grilled cheese sandwich for brunch and between the juice and the sample coffee cake, they had to take their pancakes home. I had the Athens skillet with eggs, potatoes, archichokes, feta, tomatoe and it was soo good and huge, I ate only half of it and then didn't eat for another 10 hours! The bialy was soft and chewy! My first time. Converted. My husband ordered the french toast and ate all of it! 4 giant, thick slices.  This is the place for the Travel Channel Man vs Food challenge that was featured and I saw others ordered the famous sliders and they were meals in itself.  I see why it's a challenge to eat 10 or a dozen to get your picture on the wall. No way for me, but I'll try one next time. Waited only 15 min and the service was great.  I think I knew this place would be good because they had both a deli and a baked goods case. Takeout, too..A feast for the eyes and the stomach. Cream cheese by the pound.  Chocolate babka! and this wasn't even Christmastime.   I can get babka year round?! yeah! The leftovers eaten the next day and that was even better! Love this place since they guys will love it since it had tvs around the dining area, too."}
{"text":"Despite some of the negative reviews, I loved this place simply because of their \"Fitness Boot Camp\" menu (served all day) which had healthy egg white and low calorie options. 

Will come back for desserts which look very appetizing when I don't feel the need for egg whites :-)"}
{"text":"Love the Jewish food here but the waits and medium customer service is disappointing. Definitely the best Jewish Deli in the Valley but I'm not sure it has much competition in that title. 
They are slower than any other place I have ever been to get deli to go and they are far from efficient in filling their orders. I also have yet to be helped by someone who is actually friendly. These factors make me feel this place is not living up to the reputation it seems to have earned somehow."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix, one of the guys in our party recommended Chompie's Deli as he had visited previously.  I'm thankful he suggested it.  First let me start by saying they gave me a free Black and White Cookie just for doing a Yelp check-in.  (Look to the Cookie People).  I ordered a Pastrami Reuben with Fries and Coleslaw.  I love a good reuben, we even make them at home quite often.  

The pastrami reuben at Chompie's is a ridiculous pile of meat.  I loved this sandwich.  Sure, after you may feel like you'll never be hungry again but that feeling will fade.  The pastrami was warm and fatty and cut perfectly.  I don't know that I've had a reuben like this one previously.  I can't wait for a return trip so I can repeat the experience.  I should add, the coleslaw tasted like a great creamy southern coleslaw so that was a great surprise as well.  The desserts were decent, but even though I waited until later that night to eat dessert, I was still too full to enjoy it."}
{"text":"The moms was in town this weekend and the only was to cure a tough ASU football loss was to head to Chompies on Sunday morning. We were prepared for the 30 minute wait for a table of 5, but grabbed a pastry from the front while we waited. The reviews said I had to try the sliders, so I did Jewish sliders with fries hit the spot. No room for the dessert but grabbed a pastry to go and got another for the moms for FREE for checking in. Yelp always comin in clutch for the moms!"}
{"text":"Incredibly odd layout to this place.  I needed a few minutes and a rosetta stone to figure out why there needs to be segregated dining.  Still a mystery.  
The food is pretty good.  I echo the overall sentiment about the authenticity.  But they've done a decent job of melding the Upper East Side with the Southwest. One thing they should have left on Manhattan is that NYC attitude.  Because customer service matters in the rest of the world."}
{"text":"I went for lunch break with a girlfriend from work. I've been to Chompie's at the Paradise Valley Mall. Our lunches were good but I thought a bit expensive. We had Arthur our server who was pleasant, helpful and prompt with our service. I order the Rueben with chicken soup. The soup is always great and tastes like my grandmas! The Rueben was delicious with quality meat but slightly greasy. My gal pal had the sliders which she also enjoyed. A nice meal in a mall and the expected quality and service for Chompies! Thanks Arthur!"}
{"text":"It's nice to have a deli like this in the desert. Feels like a quick trip to either of the coasts where you can get a taste of home. This chain originated on the East, and its New York style decor is tasteful. The menu, like at any good Jewish deli, is vast. Hard to decide, but I tend to stick with my usuals in the end. Brisket, and I hear the pastrami is excellent. The Jewish sliders are good--made with tender brisket layered on a thick potato pancake, tucked between a somewhat dry challah bun. Tonight the sliders were half off for customer appreciation, to celebrate 35 years of business. $2 per sandwich is a pretty sweet deal. The matzo ball soup should be ordered 'mish mash' style, and is delicious and filling. Best part always is the deli and bakery counter, where the service is friendly and the treats tempting. Took some cookies home and found that they looked better than they tasted, though. This place seems to always have deals going on, too. Disappointing, however, because it's not really kosher, which is why I went in the first place. Nonetheless, the dill pickles are crunchy and plentiful, and I'm sure I'll go back."}
{"text":"As a Chicago native corned beef starved on Tucson, Chompies in Phoenix is a little bit of heaven for me.  Please please please open a store in Tucson.  There is no competition here, no Jewish deli at all!

The chopped liver is righteous too!.  
My only complaint--deli counter service is glacially slow."}
{"text":"I am a regular at your establishment and always have a good experience.  Food is always fresh and served on time.  Love the pickles and i always stop by the deli for bagels.  Caylyn is the server you want she is fast and a real sweetheart always has a beautiful smile.  20 percent military discounts.  Thanks for great food and supporting the military."}
{"text":"I have not had the deli sandwiches here, but this is one of my go-to breakfast spots when I am back in Chandler. They have a huge selection of egg dishes -- omelets, skillets, benedicts, Latin inspired -- and I have not been disappointed with much here. The coffee is alright, but my friend and I realized that one hazelnut and one french vanilla creamer per cup make for an excellent combination. Many of the dishes, the Cabo Skillet being my favorite, come with your choice of bagel. The bagels are great here, of course! I recommend the Jalapeño Cheddar bagel to complete the breakfast.

Side-note: My guest ordered the Chompie's French Toast, which is both battered and fried. It was good, but only order this if you regularly enjoy donut breakfasts. I will stick to the higher-protein options!"}
{"text":"The food at Chompies gets a 5 star rating each and every time. The pastrami is delicious the roast beef is tender and  the chopped liver is almost as good as mine. The food always satisfies.

This service is the worst ever. Table service is usually fairly slow. But today we went to the counter and were served by Haley. I have never seen a more absent-minded, slow server in my life. We ordered one sandwich and a quarter pound of pastrami. After waiting approximately 25 minutes we saw the manager and asked what happened to the sandwich. We were told it was being finished up and then we saw him rush back to slice the meat for the sandwich. He said the sandwich only takes a minute or two to make but no one ever seems to have put in the ticket. They weren't even sure where the sliced pastrami was.

So if you have a lot of time to spare, and I do mean a lot, go to Chompie's and either sit down or get a sandwich to go. But if you are in a rush like we were today, you will be late for your appointment."}

Chompies  has the old New York style ambiance and the food to match. The portions are large, really large, these portions are big enough for two. So bring a big appetite.  Chompies serves all the authentic deli sandwiches, soups, salads, bagels, breads and desserts.

I've  been to Chompie's several times and have never been disappointed and now there is a Chompies close by. The Arrowhead location is open for business. The service at this location  is just like the others, attentive, and spot on. 

 The sandwiches at Chompies are incredible. The  Pastrami and Corned Beef are perfectly lean, piled high,and oh so tender. If you make it to Chompies you have to try the Original  Jewish sliders.  These sliders are incredible. Moist lean brisket, piled high on challah roll, a mini potato pancake on the bottom,  with jack cheese, served with a side of hot brown dipping  gravy. This slider couldn't be any better.


The soups are wonderful, especially the matzo ball. The pastry counter is endless, you have to try the black and white cookie

Chompie's is a must for breakfast or lunch if your in the area!"}

{"text":"This location is awesome! It's big, always clean, and spot-on with their customer service...always reliable, very efficient, and very friendly. 

The meal I ordered was delicious, well-cooked, and very enjoyable. I would definitely visit this location again, no questions asked!"}
{"text":"Usually I'd give this location all 5 stars but after this visit, my opinion dropped a star. Why? Well, first of all because our table was really wobbly and would move whenever we'd lift up our drinks to take a sip, or move ANYTHING on the table. Second, because it was so freaking COLD in there, due to the ceiling fan above us on full speed and the A/C blowing down. I shivered the entire duration of the meal. 

Our friend had to keep reminding the waitress, and the helper who helped serve our food, that he ordered cocktail sauce for his All You Can Eat Fish & Chips. It took FOREVER to get that to him! We all got the Fish & Chips Friday Special...while it was pretty good, my fries were too done for me to the point I could only finish about half of them...and just having recent oral surgery, I couldn't eat anything super hard or crunchy due to sensitivity and the surgery areas in the process of healing. My fish, however, was just right and I could eat it without fail. 

Took home a piece of Red Velvet Cake for dessert. The cake itself was dry and the frosting was perfect. I was rather disappointed. Also, the floor inside the restaurant was slick and felt greasy. That itself is a safety hazzard."}
{"text":"While Chompie's is supposed to be representative of a NY deli, who knew they would have the BEST blueberry pancakes AND I can get them any time of day. There have been more than one occasion where I order blueberry pancakes and coffee for dinner. Highly recommend trying the pancakes, will not disappoint. Oh! And the short stack is HUGE!"}
{"text":"Chompie's deli is tucked away near a mall in Phoenix, and i wouldn't want it any other way. My friends and I were tipped off to chompie's by an inconspicuous sign on the highway, little did we know we were about to stumble upon one of the greatest gems known to the world. Being the gluten-free consumer I am I instantly was attracted to the menu with a dedicated gluten free section. Off this section I ordered the breakfast tacos. The atmosphere is friendly, the birds living inside are chirping as per usual down here, and the menu nothing short of huge. We were first served a small bowl of pickle wedges and I almost jumped out of my booth because I could not have asked for something I love more. After practically inhaling the pickles our food shortly arrived. Usually my breakfast tacos that I order at other restaurants come already put together, but chompie's gives all the resources to you and let's you go wild like a kid in a candy shop. All the classic breakfast tacos staples were on the large plate; beans, avocado, cheese, and the egg/bacon/sausage/onion blend itself. The tortillas came separately rolled in aluminum foil and were just about as hot as the backside of the devil himself. Once my tortillas cooled off I loaded up my first taco and bit into what I would call a total body transformation. In that moment I became one with the breakfast taco, I could feel the salsa running through my veins, my skin turned to tortilla, I felt eggs slowly taking over my body. Fortunately I snapped out of the breakfast taco induced trance before I went full-taco. The prices are reasonable and there is even a reward plan. Overall fantastic place that is kind of hidden away in Phoenix. I 100% recommend this to anybody."}
{"text":"I eat at a Chompie's about 3 to 4 times a year, usually the Chandler, Shea or University locations depending where I am in town at the time.  I really can't say I notice a great difference in their food, service or cleanliness.  During the past decade I have tried most things on their menu, with mostly positive thoughts.  Our last Chiompie lunch was here in Scottsdale and as we have a \"soft spot\" for their original slider, I ordered 4 for my wife and I.
We love that cup of rich gravy that comes with it to dunk!  I grew up in NYC and have always been a deli fan who has known the best, and they compete in most areas. We would frequently order a corned beef or pastrami sandwich and a bagel, then remove some of that mountain of cold cuts and construct a very meaty additional sandwich at no further charge! I like to nibble on the half sour kosher pickles they place on every table at no charge.  Certainly worthy of 4 stars."}
{"text":"Jewtastic fares here are so so.  They really cram how New York they are down your throat and then don't deliver on quality.

The deli is the way to go here.  Get a bagel or a sandwich.  Stay away from the breakfasts unless you're really not picky about what shows up.

There is the east coast 10 pages of menu though.  You do have options, but you need to realize that most of it isn't that great.

The last time I went here, the waitress greeted me with \"Sup!\"  After a pause where nothing else was bubbling out of her, I correctly surmised that this was my queue to tell her what I wanted to order.

It's New York style chow with New York style prices.  

(I guess.  I thought that the food in New York was actually good when I was there.  They have competition, I suppose.  Not so much here.)

No service, but hey.  No competition either.  They're the only place that you can get jewish nosh in town."}
{"text":"Really really loved this chompies, they're doing something right for sure! Our server was amazing to being with. He never made us feel awkward and gave his honest opinion when I ask which item he preferred. I ended up ordering the granny girls skillet, which was just as amazing. I love that you can choose between toast, a biscuit, or one of their amazing bagels. My boyfriend got the Philly cheese steak , which he says was also very very tasty. Overall I will definitely be back to try out another yummy looking breakfast item (maybe that awesome looking Chompies French Toast!)"}
{"text":"Delicious as always! Catherine was very helpful in the bakery section, will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I had breakfast for dinner at Chompie's in Tempe. I had a basic breakfast with a sesame seed bagel. I had butter only on bagel and noticed a strange taste. My husband tasted it and confirmed it was a moldy taste. The waitress was a trooper and tasted the other half of my bagel and promptly spit it out. She agreed it tasted moldy and got the manager. Mr manager was very sure their bagels were baked fresh daily. I just know there was no sign of mold but a very strong taste of mold. He offered me something else so I took an eclair to go but he still charged me for my meal.  My coffee was luke warm, my husbands bacon was tiny and his over medium eggs were runny. If manager had taken my breakfast off the bill I might give them another chance but he blew it with customer service. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I haven't felt taken advantage of by restaurant in a long time but the price they charge the quality of the food and the size of the portions are not even close to worth it. My $17 sandwich it was a $12 sandwich if it was cooked correctly but it was cooked incorrectly the chicken was dry. The side was a $0.69 poorly made coleslaw. The pickles were inedible it tasted like somebody made some major error in the brine it was inedible."}
{"text":"Just tried Chompies first time Arizona eggs Benedict was great and potato pancake was even better. Sue was our waitress very nice and her service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and was so disappointed. :( my husband got the Jewish sliders and they were cold, along with his side of fries. The potato pancakes on them were soggy. He said they were bland and to quote him - \"Thank God for gravy\" lol I tried them and thought they were alright, would be better if they were hot!

I had the original Reuben sandwich with pastrami. It was your standard Reuben but the sauerkraut was the worst I've ever had. No flavor and literally tasted like boiled plain cabbage. I was thinking that there was just not much on my sandwich but when I picked it apart I found that there was a good amount, it just had no flavor. My fries were also cold, but my sandwich was hot so I was thankful for that. 

The service was nice though, drinks were never empty. For a Sprite (2.69), my Reuben ($17) and my husband's sliders ($14), the total came to $37 plus a $7 dollar tip we paid $44. We have never been so sad to waste $44 dollars. Lol. We won't be back. We will make the drive to Miracle Mile instead."}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal despite the long wait to be seated and to receive our orders. The food was tasty and the serve was great!"}
{"text":"Always the best. The PV location is really good they have a nice small bar area to have some potato pancakes and pastrami. Also a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service.  We stopped at the Chandler Chompies on a business trip from Tucson to Phoenix and was really impressed.  We had corned beef and a pastrami sandwiches and split a bowl of chicken soup with kreplach.  Food was great--like being in a New York deli, but best of all was the service by our waitperson.  The manager, Adam S, also came by to see how everything was, how we liked the food, and a little about us.  This caring management also reflects in the quality of the entire staff.  I'm glad we decided on Chompies and especially glad we went to this particular Chompies."}
{"text":"Today I am disappointed in my breakfast. We normally love Chompies. But today my 2 egg scrambled breakfast with chorizo on the side, crispy hashbrowns and sourdough toast was less than perfect.  Hash browns undercooked, and chorizo burned. And not to be too picky,  but I asked for scrambled eggs and received a 2 egg empty omelet. Similar but not the same. 

Coffee fairly good. Just disapointed today. Last Saturday same breakfast was perfect. Maybe a new cook."}
{"text":"I'm seriously behind in my Yelp reviews, but here's what I remember:

The hostess had no hosting skills.  If you're going to walk by me 117 times before seating me, you could at least acknowledge I'm waiting.  

The server had no serving skills whatsoever.  Do you seriously need to reach over me to take the condiments off the table and give them to someone else?  Petty, I know.  She was at least friendly and adequately attentive.

Thankfully, the cook had some degree of cooking skills.  I had the Western sliders (challah rolls filled with BBQ brisket) and while nothing spectacular, it was solidly A-OK.  I think I prefer the Jewish sliders (brisket minus the BBQ, add a potato pancake).

My favorite part of Chompie's is the window shopping after dinner in the bakery.  Sadly we were unable to be helped in the small window of time I had before the plus one decided it was taking too long.  A decision he later regretted I'm sure."}
{"text":"I went to Chompies for the first time recently at a great UYE.  What better way to try somewhere new?  Even if the food is a big fat fail, you know you'll have great company!

Luckily, it wasn't a big fat fail.  It was a big fat success.  Tried the Jewish sliders with brisket, gravy, and a potato pancake.  It was like a home-cooked Sunday dinner mom used to make all wrapped up in a challah roll.  Except mom rarely made \"Sunday dinner\" , and if she did, it would have been wrapped in a tortilla or a Sonic brown paper bag, since we never heard of challah.  But aside from those minor differences, it was just like Sunday dinner.

Great service for our rather large group, too.  They even brought out some little cookies for us to try, which led us to the bakery on our way out!  Thanks to Jim and Audrey for organizing, and thanks to Chompie's for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I had one of the skillets, and was very impressed.  Huge portions of food, and all of it was quite good."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the menu, there are a ton of great looking selections.  I got one of their omelettes this time around and left happy.  The food portions are huge."}
{"text":"The corned beef sandwich was tasty. My husband had the chicken fried steak which wasn't bad. That being said I think the coffee was the worst I have ever had at a breakfast place. It was so watery and weak, I couldn't drink it. I complained about it but our server said she thinks that's just the way they brew it. Also, the prices on sandwiches are high at Chompie's, and everything is an add on. I looked at the price for a gluten free Reuben and it was literally $17 and change. Almost $20 for a sandwich, really?? This is Phoenix, not NY. Btw, if you call yourself a NY style deli..you need great coffee that is strong and black, not coffee that looks like iced tea when you pour it from the pitcher. I have lived in the Pacific Northwest and I know good coffee...Chompie's really let me down in this department. Anyway, I don't think I will be going back. The good corned beef wasn't good enough to cancel out the high menu prices and bad coffee."}
{"text":"There is just no way I can give a score less than 5 today.  And why you aks?
1.  I had the Hot Pastrami (Half) with potato salad.  - that sandwich made me utter OMG's with each bite....all the way to the very end...and even then I was eating morsels of pastrami that had dropped on the plate.  And the fresh baked Jewish Rye bread....OMG's once again.  The best choice to have with the pastrami.
2.  My wife had the turkey sandwich (Half) and she too was raving over how fresh and good it tasted and she had it on the Marble Rye bread.
3.  I chose potato salad for my side. - potato salad was ok...a bit above average but it could have used a bit more seasoning of flavors.
4.  My wife chose the Coleslaw.  The Coleslaw actually outdid the potato salad.  In fact, I did not order the Coleslaw because generally speaking the only good restaurant Coleslaw to be found is in the Southern restaurants - they know how to make darn good Coleslaw.  Well, Chompie's Coleslaw was definitely up there with Southern Coleslaw.  I will order it the next time for my side.
5.  Robert was our wait person today.  His attention to everything was definitely a 5 star performance.  And watching and listening to Robert attend to and check on each and every guest he was serving was done with attention to detail all the while not missing a step.  Kudos to Robert today for the fine service.

There you have it.....my 5 reasons for giving a rating of 5 stars.  Would I go back?  Yes.  The only problem is it looks like it might take me at least 3 years to try all the many delicious things that I saw on the menu today....and breakfast is another whole story."}
{"text":"This place is not worth my time prices are ridiculous they show that they give a military discount if you are a military family the military discount should come off the whole bill not just for the military person showing the card.prices for a drink or highway robbery, service was slow had to ask for different things coffee was way too strong to cook didn't understand English order was sent back for eggs not being cooked the right way this was our first time there and the service was just poor, poor, poor ,poor  I'd heard so much about this place and I wanted to try it well like I said it won't be back again"}
{"text":"I've always associated Chompie's with being a deli where I could get great bagels and bagel sandwiches but for some reason I totally missed the ball on it also being a great sit down restaurant as well. Reminiscent of a deli-diner hybrid in New York, but with slightly more space, we decided to get breakfast here one Sunday since Oink nearby had a 40 minute wait.

I had the Cabo Skillet. It features fresh cilantro, green chilies, jalapeños, tomatoes, onions, green peppers, and scallions over home fries (or country potatoes what I thought). It was topped with Jalapeño Jack cheese, avocado and served with sour cream and salsa. If that alone wasn't enough food, a bagel of my choice was served on the side. I'm not special though. Almost every breakfast entreé comes with a freshly toasted bagel!! 

I love it here! I wish it was just a bit closer so I could order that Cabo skillet more often!!"}
{"text":"I visited this Chompie's location today for brunch with my friend. I usually dine at the location in Tempe and after my experience at this location probably will stick to the one in Tempe only. This was an all around poor visit. From the greeting as we walked in to the walk out the door. The atmosphere was so dull, my food was warm not hot, the service was slow, there was no attempt to make for a great visit. Everyone seemed to be so disconnected. We didn't receive silverware when we sat down and actually had to get up and get it from a station set up on a table next to use for servers to roll silverware. We also saw other tables doing that too...
The worst part about the visit was the manager's actions. He was very short when we arrived. We never saw him talking to tables. And on top of that, in the middle of our service he was in our view while outside smoking a cigarette and plying on his phone in the front of the restaurant. 
Like I said, we'll stick to one in Tempe after that."}
{"text":"Was this place ever good or did I just have really low standards? It's so commercial and they act like they know NY Jewish deli. Let me tell you they have lost touch with their roots. Everything from the soups to the matzo brei is awful. Literally inedible. And who do they think they are charging so much for this swill?"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Phoenix, I stop into Chompies at least once.

They have a cool breakfast/lunchy deli theme. It would be like dressing up a hole in the wall ny deli.

I usually get breakfast even at lunch time.

The staff is normally friendly and inviting.

The food options are plentiful. Anything you want from a NY Deli is here. They bake their own breads and make most everything in house. 

Chompies serves BIG oversized portions and I usually dont finish mine but will also try other peoples dishes when I'm there. order frsh squeezed OJ its the real deal.

I was watching Man VS Food and he did a challange there and he couldnt do it. Its a dozen chopped sauteed beef brisket, latke potato cake topped with onions and cheese on a homemade bun thing(I forgot what they call it). sliders and they looked so good I'm gonna get those next time I'm there.

Make sure to try any of the desserts. They display them nicely and eat it or take it home.mmmmm

Anyways theres a couple of Chompies in Metro Phoenix/Scottsdale area and go to either one and you'll get some good grub!"}
{"text":"The taste of New York in the desert!

I was introduced to Chompies at the spring fling at their Glendale location and instantly fell in love *cue the violons* ;)

They make their own mustard and pickles as any legit deli should. No Guldens or generic spicy mustard will disgrace my pastrami on rye sandwich! Lololol

While I was there I noticed their bagel game was spot on! People were loading up bagfuls!!!!

Another thing I noticed is the menu is overwhelming not only to some customers and staff members I met in both locations I've been to so far. With that said I wonder if the company would be more profitable and in turn have better customer service if low selling items for each location are nixed from the everyday menu (maybe offer them as monthly specials or promotions)???

I also tried some sweet treats:
*peanut butter/chocolate gluten free brownie - moist and delicious!!!
*biscotti - meh, just ok
*Mexican wedding cookies - did not enjoy
*laceys - good

As others have already mentioned *sigh* service can be spotty depending on if you are not a regular, aren't dining in, did not order ahead or you just get a new person.
But, since the food quality is exceptional I'm willing to overlook it.

During this visit I didn't want to bug the take out staff again so I asked one of the gals on the sit down restaurant side for a side of their wonderful mustard and she was so gracious enough to get me a side so I could thoroughly enjoy my sandwich. That customer care bumped my 3.25 experience up to a 4.

High Yelp marks or not I hope Chompies will have continued success and hopefully open new locations in the future!"}
{"text":"There's really nothing better than breakfast at Chompies on the weekend. With pancakes the size of your head, and the BEST corned beef hash I've ever tasted, why would ever go anywhere else? Their sandwhiches are feats of engineering, and i love that you get delicious dill pickles as soon as you sit down.

Their matzo ball soup has helped through many a hangover and if you're still not sure, try their baked goods! delicious rugelach and other sweet items. 

We went to the one on Shea for the Rosh Hashana dinner (delicious and a great deal for a couple of Jews without a large community of Jewish friends), and I have to say I like the University location better. Great ambiance with the posters what not, and the staff is always pleasant and knows how to treat you.

What can i say, I LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Ok, so we went back to Chompies after having an unbelievably horrible experience.  We were with a group of about 20 and dragged to the Chandler Choppies kicking and screaming.  Although certain things were on the menu, they were, again, not available for purchase.  I think they just keep them there to frustrate the patrons.  Anyway, the food that did come out was hot, tasty, and abundant.  The service was very good too.  Bravo, Chandler Chompies.  I still miss NY deli, but would definitely go back should I be down your way again."}
{"text":"This Deli is truly what a Deli is like in New York and Chicago....the food is fabulous, the staff is very funny and very polite.  Please be ready for a two hand challenge.....the servings are gigantic.....take help when you go."}
{"text":"Chompies has been a staple for our family since moving back here approximately 3 years ago. Our favorite place for breakfast, sandwiches, matzo ball soup and pastries hands-down. The rest of the menu is mediocre but, if you're not going to a Jewish deli for one of the previous mentioned options, what are you going for??
The staff, particularly the owners are extremely inviting and service oriented and Chompies is definitely a place we recommend and will frequently return to."}
{"text":"If there was the option to give 6 stars, I would do it.  Chompie's is incredible.  I eat here all the time (it is close to my home), and I have NEVER had anything less than delicious food and awesome service.  If you are looking for top-notch deli food served by people that care, go to Chompie's!"}
{"text":"Well, hubby has a new favorite: Cajun Chicken Ecstasy sandwich, and he in fact agreed, it was ecstasy.

I am doing low carb so I didn't taste the sandwich, but next time I will have a piece of the chicken, cheese and green chile.

Also, if I was not doing low carb, I would have ordered the matzo soup, which I love since I dared to try it on December 2013.

Our server Olivia was very friendly and accommodating. I had ordered the chicken chopped liver... which I thought it was going to be chopped-liver, you know, like chopped onions are decent size pieces of onion, but it was more like a dip (it was a scoop, actually) and it was also kind of sweet. Olivia helped me swap it for real liver and onions, since she saw the disappointment in my face...
The portion was really big (I think I can have at least 2 meals, maybe 2.5 from it), and it came with 2 sides. I chose green salad (that I barely tasted) and broccoli, I think it said steamed broccoli. That I didn't like much because the broccoli was kind of mushy... but the liver was good.

Anyway, hubby absolutely loved the Cajun chicken sandwich, so we will probobaly be back soon enough."}
{"text":"Well, not exactly 'yay', I'm a fan, but we had a good experience this time. 
Portions are massive. Food was good. Service was good too. Our server did not seem very knowledgeable, I am not sure if she was new, but she was good. Also, I liked how servers teamed up to take good care of customers.
Neighbor had the Lox bagel with cream cheese and I have been craving that ever since :(
Hubby had the chompadilla and he thought it was OK, he liked the seasoned potatoes very much.

I had a cheese omelette with mushroom and artichokes. It was really good. The con is that I only wanted an omelette (cheaper of course) but they were not very accommodating so apparently I had to order the whole whatever combo with potatoes and bread.

The other matter I did not like is that, we stopped there in the first place because I had a reward that I wanted to use, but when the server returned she said I did not.

Later on I received a 'welcome' text from their rewards club. Oh well, either they messed up, or they have separate rewards accounts for each location, which is not in fact very practical, so that was a big disappointment.

I liked this location a little better, the layout is similar to the old location on Greenway and 32nd."}
{"text":"I ate here once before and had a pretty ok experience, but after tonight I won't be back. I stopped on my way home from work and bought a quart of chicken noodle soup, a half of corned beef sandwich, a creme brulee, 2 bagels and a loaf of rye. With tip this cost me almost $40. I asked for extra lean on the corned beef sandwich but I have no idea if she heard me or whether I was charged for it, because I didn't get a receipt. BOY was I disappointed when I got home with my food. The corned beef sandwich was REALLY FAR from lean; it was rubbery, fatty, and almost slimy with fat. We threw away the entire sandwich. (10.99 for a half sandwich that went right in the garbage.) So we moved on to the soup. Let me tell you, Campbell's would have been better. It was flavorless, mushy, and the chicken was sort of gross. (I pulled one chunk out that was all gristle, skin and purple stuff.) This also got dumped straight down the drain, for $8.99. So that's $20 for food that was throw away. The creme brulee was actually really tasty, which is why this is 2 stars instead of one. I haven't eaten the rye bread or bagels, but they both seem fine.

OH! And even the pickle basically just tasted like a cucumber that had barely been pickled.

EDIT: I ate one of the \"cragels\" the next morning and it was raw in the middle. :|"}
{"text":"Why is it that at 12:30pm there is a 20 minute wait when there are plenty of empty tables staring at us?  \"Chompie's Famous Mile-High Sandwiches\" aren't so \"mile-high\".  Been a big fan of Chompies for years but today was just a rip off.  Ordered the rare roast beef \"mile-high\" sandwich.  I got it on a kaiser roll and that was a huge mistake because the roll overwhelmed the flavorless roast beef due to the fact that there was so little of it!  Tasted a lot more bread than I did roast beef.  And for the treat I paid $15.99."}
{"text":"Had the All-American breakfast OVER HERE AT THE CHOMPINATOR. It was pretty legit but nothing special. It doesn't disappoint let's put it that way YEEAAAH! Oh and the waitress lied about the orange juice being non-concrentrated. Dollar tip!"}
{"text":"A hit or a miss kinda location. Sometimes excellent service and most delicious food and sometimes it's polar opposite which includes slow service and burnt food! 
So mid grounds on this location."}
{"text":"Gotta love chompies.  The sandwiches there are so good and massive but my go to is always the jewish sliders.  Everything about those things from the soft roll to the gravy you dunk them in is so good.  It's a must have on a Sunday after too much drinking on Saturday night.  It's usually packed on weekends around lunch time so just plan on taking your time but it is worth it."}
{"text":"I beg to differ, dude.  Here on holiday and let's just say, Chompie's is better than the average chipotle lovin, brain boiling sad excuse for a seafood restaurant place in BFE (AZ)!!!!

I've only been to this one location and from the taste of it, it was one of a kind!  The first time we went I got the latkes (yum, best ones I've had that weren't home cookin) and the second time I went for the hot pastrami sandwich (so good)!!  The bread was a little soggy, so if you go for it, do it right and ask for the bread to be extra toasty...  Overall, good place.  I wish we had a nice reasonably priced jewish deli where we lived!!"}
{"text":"Got a free black and white cookie for checking in asked if I could swap it for a different t one since the other cookies were cheaper and the girl was just like you have to get this one we do it that way so you buy more. Tastes the cookie and threw the whole thing away. Worst cookie I ever tasted.  If this is marketing they should rethink everything and offer a regular chocolate chip cookie. Only reason they get 4 stars is because I've had their cakes before and they are amazing."}
{"text":"I spent 7 days in Arizona and the meal I had here turned out to be infinitely better than the $40 steaks we had at a lodge by the Grand Canyon.  

Although it was a bit of a wait, I could not have been happier with my meal.  I had one of the hot corned beef sandwiches with a side of wedge fries.  It was such a simple dinner, but packed with flavor and super lean meat.  Very little fat.  Our server was kind and attentive as well.  

My mother ordered the Cobb salad which she literally said was the best salad she ever had.  The potato pancakes and matzo ball soup were also good. 

For dessert we stopped by the pastry counter and got some cookies and an eclair.  They were delicious and we finished them as soon as we got back to the hotel.  

5 stars because the food was so simple and done so right.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Our silver actually brought our appetizer well before our meal which was great. Pickles were as usual very good. Main course which was the special of buy one hot dog get one free with shared and Roy well prepared. All in all great service a wonderful server and all-around good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Saved my life when I was sick and nothing tasted right.  Bummer to be on vacation in a strange town, and no way to cook something gentle for my stomach. I ordered a bowl of chicken soup and the stuffed cabbage and found my appetite.  I was so delighted.  Hubby had a plain old hamburger.  Would you believe if was one of the best I have ever tasted?  We shall return!"}
{"text":"Got a yummy lox, Jewish sliders are a must and burgers have a char to kill. A great first experience"}
{"text":"The country fried steak was a solid 4-stars.

The eggs were cooked perfectly and tasted great.  Bagel and home fries were delicious.  5-stars."}
{"text":"I will never be back to this location, let alone this restaurant. After my boyfriend and I were sat, we immediately ordered, since we only had 45 min left of our lunch hour. After over 30 minutes of waiting for our DELI MEAT sandwiches, I found what looked like a manager and said we had been waiting a long time and soon had to go. He disappears and later comes back to the table, blaming it on the kitchen that somehow the ticket was misplaced. I used to serve, I get that shit happens but our waitress, who was horrible at this point, should have noticed sooner. So we got our mediocre sandwiches and barely had time to eat them. The quality was Nothing like I had remembered and I only ate it because it was starving. The pickles served tasted sour. And of course, because the Jewish owner would rather just banter and wave his hands at us, opposed to doing anything about this disgusting experience, I'm taking my business elsewhere. Do not go to this location if anything. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Seated and waited 10 minutes before leaving.  The restaurant was not busy, but not a server in sight, and the one that we spotted looked like someone kicked her puppy.  We left and weren't even acknowledged as we passed the hostess and servers, who were too busy gossiping as we walked out.  Even warned a couple coming in they may get ignored as well.  Guess they won't get our gelt today."}
{"text":"Extremely low quality food for the price. My cajun chicken sandwich tasted like it was made from frozen chicken breasts bought at Sam's Club! There were chewy areas that tasted like they hadn't quite thawed or defrosted in a microwave! My fries tasted like they were at least a day old, and my coleslaw salad tasted like it was from a tub that should've been thrown out in the trash a few days ago. Overall, good friendly service but really, really poor quality food. 

Also, check out the bathrooms if you need another reason to stay away. Absolutely disgusting, looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in days. Not kidding."}
{"text":"A weeks worth of great food in Phoenix abd this was by far the worst. The Monty Cristo was not good. I love Monty Cristo sandwiches, but this place batters abd fried them. The batter was soggy and way too much batter. It was a big disappointment. My wife had the western omelette the onions and peppers were very undercooked. Her bagel was dry and void of any blueberry flavor. Save yourself some disappointment and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Oy vay! If I had a Jewish grandmother this is what she would have said about me eating to much! My make believe grandmothers name is Chompie, short for Selchompma. 

I try to visit her as often as I can even when its been a few weeks she always welcomes me back, like a good grandmother does. She makes the chewy yummy bagels that a chubby guy like me cant resist.. her pirogies are so delicious that 8 of them aren't enough.. everything she has ever cooked me has always hit the spot.. oh Nana Chompie  knows that spot really well.. from the home made pickles she puts on the table to the deep fried goodness of the Monte Cristo sandwich.

I take solace knowing that she will always be there for me, even though she is just a wonderful deli.. I look forward to her warm embrace."}
{"text":"Monster sandwiches!

Chompies for sure has some good sandwiches and I believe they are kosher for those who that helps out too...

This place gets packed for a reason. 

Definitely worth a taste!"}
{"text":"Sat for 20 minutes and no one came to take our order. We've been here plenty of times before when it's busier and have been served in a reasonable amount of time. There were plenty of servers although no sense of urgency for customer service. Still plenty of tables open and back section empty. Bummer. Doesn't even deserve one star but no other way to write the review."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. It's basically the best deli in AZ, but then again, it's kind of the only big game in town. 

Their mile high sandwiches are my old standby. Love their meats! The matzo ball soup is also really good. If you like a deep fried monti cristo sandwich, they do that too. Last time we got the chicken livers as an appetizer, and I'd have to say that I like the stuff at Don & Charlie's a bit better. 

I've been going to this location for the over 15 years (they even catered my bar mitzvah back in 1996) and I don't think anything has changed. The mural on the wall is beginning to look like a time capsule. I think the only thing that frequently gets updated is the menu. They also have an interesting frequent diner thing now, but I haven't figured that out yet.

Get a cookie from the bakery before you leave because they're just as good as the food."}
{"text":"Probably the best deli anywhere in Arizona!   :)  HUGE menu & the portions are Big!     Amazing dessert counter in the front!!!!"}
{"text":"I now firmly believe that yelp was created by someone who ate (or at least attempted) to ear here. 3 months ago my family came in and after 15-20 minutes without even being acknowledged,  we left, and I then yelped.  I was contacted by someone at Chompies who's important enough to man their yelp account, and told that my name was on a \"list\" and they'd \"make it right\" on my next visit. So,  here we are 3 months later and my daughter wanted a bagel - so against my better judgment,  we thought we'd give Chompies a chance to do what they previously promised to do, and make it right.
Keep in mind we arrived at about 1:30 in the afternoon and the place was half-full at best. Low and behold though, we had a case of some serious dejavu! After 10 minutes of many waiters walking by but not stopping or saying a word to us -  I thought I'd go over to the bar area where they had a host, a waiter, and some girl with a name tag on but was sitting on an actual barstool, all having a great time. I told the host that we'd been there for 10 minutes and Yada Yada yada..and asked if there was a waiter that could assist. He said he get one for us, and another 5 minutes go by, still no service to speak of so we left.. again!! I was able to speak to a manager on the way out and voice my concern and she said she even remembered this happening to us the last time we were there. It boggles my mind how naturally it comes to practically everyone working there, that their customers don't matter. Well played Chompies,  well played."}
{"text":"What a good restaurant. Very clean, desserts looked fantastic.  I had the chicken sandwich and asked for it on a bed of lettuce, it was very good. Our waitress made the lunch 5 stars. She was very attentive, friendly, even asked if we wanted more tea to go. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been to Chompie's many times for deli, take out, and dine in. I've always had good service but this past Sunday was exceptional. Our server was Nathan and he was very attentive without being overbearing. The food was very quick and he kept the coffee coming! Thank you Nathan and Chompie's! Also they have best matzo ball soup in the city!"}
{"text":"Shortly after my plane landed we headed to Chompie's because we saw the Man vs. Food challenge. 

We ordered the Reuben sandwich to split and a Jewish slider.
Man was it enough food. 

The classic reuben was delicious to say the least.
Pretty sure I had the best fries I've ever had as well. 
The slider was very very good 

Please go to Chompie's."}
{"text":"So I have eaten at allot of delis and this is one of the best I have been to. 

I had a half of chopped liver and a half of beef tongue, liver was ok and the tongue was thin and so tender. The give you allot of food but the sandwich only has the meet, if you want lettuce or tomatoes you need to ask and it's extra. 

The water was very friendly and helpful although it looked like he was in training. 

The bakery has a great selection and everything looks so wonderful that you want to try one of each. 

This is a great place and a must try and return."}
{"text":"Chompie's for breakfast! There breakfast is great - the service is always good and their \"corned beef hash\" is the best!"}
{"text":"Wendy's sammich, it's huge so split it. Fries and white mac n cheese are incredible. Great food, large portions and priced right. Great experience"}
{"text":"Chompies has won me over! After not visiting for several years, I decided to go on Christmas for some warm cozy soup after a friends recommendation. So this is what I've been deprived of? Wow, the matzo chicken soup was hearty and delicious! It has a wonderful homemade taste and feel and really hit the spot! A dash of pepper and you have a very fulfilling meal. And of course I had to have a bagel - a jalapeño bagel with cream cheese and it was scrumptious. Ask for a sample of their delicious high quality cream cheeses, there are so many yummy flavors. 

My boyfriend had the corned beef hash and he said it was the best he ever tasted. The meat was very lean and the portion was decent. He loved the coffee too (and he's picky about coffee). 

I finished off the meal with a slice of german chocolate cake. Unlike grocery stores who sell sickly sweet cakes, Chompies emphasizes the coconut and almonds while keeping the sweetness in check so I was able to enjoy sweet and savory. The cake is so awesome I plan to buy a whole sheet. Good job Chompies on taking pride in your cooking and baking. I will be back to try more and more dishes! 

Thank you to the staff for their superb customer service, I leave happy every time I visit!"}
{"text":"Chompies! Who doesn't like Chompies? Large matzo ball soup, 2 large matzo balls, it's perfect. Jewish slider, beef brisket,  potato cake, on challah roll with a side of gravy, sooo good. Western slider, beef brisket, onion strings, cheddar cheese and a side of bbq sauce. Servers and service is always pleasant food always comes out in a quickly and timely manner. If you haven't gone to Chompies, do yourself a favor and go."}
{"text":"you simply cannot go wrong with Chompies. if you can't find anything to eat here, you may as well go home and eat cereal.
The breakfast alone is reason enough. the portions are huge....enough for take home bags. And everything from sweet to savory is on the menu. I used to crave the pastrami sandwiches because they are perfectly constructed and again....gigantic. this place does not skimp.
if you're not dining in, the bakery alone is reason to visit. not only are the items superbly tasty, but they are beautiful!
service has always been great as well."}
{"text":"Chompie's knows how to do New York style delis!  This authentic and local chain is family-run and is great for breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee, dessert, and even catering.  The prices are right, and unless you're competing for weekend brunch seating, you can usually sit down pretty quickly.  Even then, if you're willing to sit at the bar or a high top, you can beat the brunch rush.  

The breakfast isn't just a breakfast.  It's \"Breakfast All Day,\" which means breakfast at night is completely acceptable!  My favorite simple breakfast is the \"Two Egg Breakfast\" though on weekdays from 6-11 AM, you can get the \"Eggciting\" two-egg full breakfast for only $5.99.  My favorite dish is Chompie's Mile High Sandwich, usually the hot corned beef or pastrami.  While I can never eat more than a half sandwich, the full sandwich makes great leftovers!  The black and white cookies are always a special treat at the bakery.  In fact, if you order anything to go from the bakery, you can check in on Yelp and get a free large black and white cookie.  Yum!!!

Also, you may remember Chompie's for being featured on Man V. Food when Adam attempted to beat the Ultimate Slider Challenge which (spoiler alert!) proved even too tough for him.  There are locations around the Valley, and they are all very similar."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed meals at three of the four Chompie's locations in the Phoenix area.  I went this evening with a group of friends and family to the Chompie's location in Scottsdale.  Our table was ready for us very quickly and we were able to order quite soon after we sat down.  We needed to ask for water refills though to give them credit, we did have a large group and it was not always clear exactly what we were needing.  

As for food itself, there are some wonderful deals on the menu from combo meals to other daily specials.  I ordered the Soup, Sandwich, and Slaw deal.  I ordered the half sandwich as pastrami and the soup as chicken noodle soup.  Both appeared quite appetizing though they both ended up being only luke warm.  The food was still \"a-okay.\"  This has not been my typical experience at the Paradise Valley or Tempe Chompie's, which is why I still gave this rating 3 stars.  As this is my only experience in years at this particular location, I wanted to clarify my reasoning. 

I still recommend Chompie's, especially for Jewish holidays such as Passover or Rosh Hashanah.  I also love the bakery and all that it has to offer."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and nice to sit down in the mall. My kids love the grilled cheese sandwiches and macaroni and cheese. I love the Jewish sliders!"}
{"text":"Have not been in a while but was near so stopped in for a coffee and bagel. Got garlic bagel with lox cream cheese half toasted and half not. Today I liked the toasted one but both were great. Plenty of cream cheese
 Server was one of the best and helped with coffee refill to go."}
{"text":"Chompies has seriously gone downhill.  The worst deli sandwiches I've eaten in forever. The prices are ridiculous too. If this is our best Jewish deli here in the Phoenix area,we're in trouble."}
{"text":"Ordered the veggie omelet with extra mushrooms. I got  something that looked more like it had veggie flakes in it and I found one sliver of a mushroom in the entire omelette. There was no broccoli to speak of other than a few green specks here and there. But hey it came with nearly half a loaf of toasted bread... Oh and about 6 hours later I got \"stomach issues\" that lasted for about 24 hours.   The second star is purely because my previous and first experience with this location went well.  Not sure if I'll give them another try in any case it will not be for a long time."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Great food. The menu is so big I would recommend looking at it online before going because it took me 15mins just to read all of their options. They seem to have something for everyone. I like the set up of the restaurant and the ambiance. The food is a little bit on the expensive side, but they give you so much food that it is difficult if not impossible for one person to finish on their own. I recommend sharing a meal with whomever you are going with. That way, none of the food goes to waste."}
{"text":"This review is based only on bialeys. Chompies always had the best bialeys.  But the last 3 times I've bought bialeys they were no good. Spongy, not at all like a bialey should be. The vegetable cream cheese is not good any more either.  Too bad. I will not be buying bialeys from chompies anymore . I'm dissapointed. Bialeys are not easy to find ."}
{"text":"The menu is massive and I've ordered something different almost every time I've visited. It's mostly pretty good. The atmosphere is okay. The bakery's a nice touch. The staff looks overworked but what restaurant staff isn't? I like the sliders. Fan of the strawberry shortcake pancakes. Reuben's nice.

TLDR; It's not mind-blowing but it's not bad. If you want some nice food in a brunchy setting, go Chompie's, just don't expect it to be blue meth. It's more like a bad blunt of MJ from your stoner friend. Not that I've ever done anything harder than ibuprofen."}
{"text":"What is with the tiny portions?  They used to be generous on the sandwiches!  Now they are 1/2 the size!  Bread is still stale, and the staff is still rude!  So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Moving from the paradise valley area over to arrowhead we were excited to try the chompies on the west side. Unfortunately we were disappointed. We got the beef brisket sandwich and the bread was stale and old. The meat was dry and not worth the 12.00 for the sandwich. Also the fries were cold. Really subpar food. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Don't get sucked in to All You Can Eat fish and chips. We got overcharged and under served in Tempe.  They 'sold out' on the first plate.  Unapologetically offered a dessert, then brought a 1/3 size normal Chompies piece of carrot cake for the mistake. Ridiculous! We won't be back to get ripped off further by the Tempe location. Manager should watch the kitchen closer and wait staff should take better care of their customers than that.  The Chompies in Scottsdale is so much better managed."}
{"text":"Love this place. People are extremely polite and attentive. We had the Cadillac pastrami and it was amazing. My daughter loved her chocolate chip pancake so much she ordered again on our next visit. Deep fried French toast,  who would of thought but it worked. Can't wait to visit Scottsdale in the spring."}
{"text":"I love most of the food here... but PLEASE get good coffee. 

The drip coffee here is horrible and has been forever. It is watered down tasting. Maybe it is just crap/cheap coffee or they try to save money by not using enough grounds per carafe. Ether way, it is horrible.


Best hits here are any of the deli sandwiches, matso ball soup, and lox & bagel. I avoid most of the other stuff as it cannot compare in taste. Breakfasts are standard fare... nothing great, nothing horrible."}
{"text":"love the Pastrami and Corned Beef!"}
{"text":"Chompies has a great cure for what ails you. We go and split the corned beef hash skillet, add an egg, and an extra bagel....and when we are finished we are right as rain to move through another day."}
{"text":"Manager contacted me via Yelp and committed to address my concerns.  Still not happy with prices but you have to admire active management.  Upgraded from 1 to 3 stars.  


My previous review:

Way to expensive for Jewish peasant food!  Will not return until prices come down!!! Ridiculous $21 for Bagel and smoked fish!!!  Criminal!  The waitress was the ONLY bright spot.  Resting on their laurels!!"}
{"text":"Chompies is so delicious! For breakfast I always have the triathlete omelette. It has feta cheese and artichokes in it and is amazing! My sister usually gets the Jewish sliders which is one of their \"famous\" items and they are off the chain! So good. The only thing not fantastic here is the weird make waiter that always works and has been my waiter every time. Just an odd ball and today he was mentioning how long his shifts are blah blah. I'm a nurse, I know, but I don't want to hear about it while I'm eating breakfast. Delicious place though!"}
{"text":"Although I have gone to Chompie's at its various locations numerous times, this is the first review I have written.

Coming from NY, it is actually refreshing to be in a place that has a massive menu, great service and significant portions.  I am SO tired of people recommending deli's and saying they are like NY.  I had my hopes dashed too many times.  This place without a doubt comes the closest to the NY deli's I went to for 20 years in Manhattan.

Now.  I discovered that I enjoy this place most when I moderate my choices.  For a long time, I was getting soup and then a huge sandwich and made sure it had cheese and fries on the side.   It made me \"fear\" Chompie's because I would end up too full.  No more.

Now, I get a small bowl of Matzoh Ball soup.  It is without a doubt the most delicious and consistently enjoyable...especially this time of year.

Then, I get a half sandwich- corned beef on marble rye...no cheese...cole slaw on the side.  Seltzer to drink.

I leave feeling great.  And because the soup comes first, I enjoy that thoroughly with no interruptions from the corned beef.

It may not be Eisenberg's on 5th Avenue and 23rd Street in Manhattan...but the soup sure comes close.  Thank you."}
{"text":"If you want authentic New York style food this is your spot!  I love the Knishes and black and white.  Chompie's Deli has my heart ever since they brought me chocolate chip pancakes when I was a kid.  They have now moved into grocery stores with their delightful bagels.  Check this place out you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good bagels and I'd recommend for some breakfast nosh."}
{"text":"To be completely honest, I had had a bit of a rough go as far as Scottsdale/Tempe dining had gone during my recent weekend visit for Spring Training. Fortunately, that all changed when I walked through the doors of Chompie's Deli.

Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?

Excellent on all fronts. Whether you're here for just a quick dessert at the bakery or for a full dining blowout with a big group (which was my case, having walked in 13 deep), Chompie's has you covered, and even our rowdy bunch was quickly accommodated by a friendly staff. Well done. Star Granted.

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Having seen Adam Richman fail to take on the slider challenge here at Chompie's, there was no doubt in my mind that I was going sliders here. While you can get three and a side for $12 ($4 per slider), you can grab the 12-slider challenge tray for $40 ($3.33 per slider). Whichever way you go, it's totally worth it. Three sliders is more than enough for a meal and the side is the cherry on the cake. I opted for the tray with half \"Jewish\" and half \"Western\":

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=LXp_5OlR7luoCdbj1HV0sg&userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg

Boom baby. Fair prices. Star Granted.

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

Wow. Honestly this was excellent. I've had sliders in the past, but nothing like the Jewish sliders here at Chompie's. The meat was great and rolls an excellent compliment, but it was the mini potato pancakes inside that really had me over the moon. They were great plain, they were great with gravy, they were great with bbq sauce, and they were great with garlic ranch, all of which were provided with very good potato-wedge style fries. This was a great experience. Dual Stars Granted.

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

I absolutely would. Not only does a massive menu compliment fair prices, a great staff and brilliant desserts at the bakery, but the sliders are unlike anything I've ever experienced. Excellent. Star Granted."}
{"text":"What can I say : it's a real Jewish deli
Love the kishka and fried matzoh balls
Awesome monte cristo Sandwich 
Incredible  bakery selection too"}
{"text":"We visited chompies nearly every Sunday for 5 years. The food for us was really good until about 2 years ago, the quality started going down hill, I imagine it was due to the economy. We still went religiously, even though the food was hit or miss. About 4 months ago we went and I had the worst experience of my life. I ordered my usual, the eggs benny with smoked salmon... when they dish was brought out i could smell the fish, i knew it wasn't fresh. After arguing with the waitress she took it back and brought me a new one, which still smelled aweful, I took a few bites and couldn't finish it. 45 minutes later i experience the worst food poisoning of my life... I called to let them know to not use that fish, no idea if the message got to the kitchen... emailed them a complaint and never heard a word. All hope is not lost though! we found a new local breakfast place that we love, so maybe it is for the better. You will be missed Chompies...."}
{"text":"I have been here during there busiest times - like - Christmas - and Today - Slider Day.  Amazing that they can still maintain quick, quality, smiling service.  The food has always been very tasty every time I have come.  Consistently good food and service?  No joke - that is very hard to find.  Thank you Chompies!  ...and then the bakery....you really need to go."}
{"text":"Excellent fast service...the staff is very friendly...The food was delicious...Its no wonder it's hard to get in early weekend mornings....I have no complaints:)"}
{"text":"Good luck getting served. Sat at lunch on a weekday for fifteen minutes with no acknowledgement from any servers. They had 10 servers on the floor and maybe 6 tables filled. When we finally left without eating, they thanked us for coming - clueless that we had never gotten a meal or that we were dissatisfied as customers. Poor start for a new restaurant option at Arrowhead."}
{"text":"We have been to this Chompies many times and enjoy the food, but today we had our first bad experience. We arrived about 1:45pm for a late lunch and had to wait even though there we numerous open tables. I asked Megan B if we could take one of the open tables but we were RUDELY told not now. She had no customer service skills. 5 minutes later we were sat at the very table I asked about.  If it were not for our waiter Joe we may not have ever  come back to this establishment. First impressions from the greeting staff are important. This Megan B should get some people skills or find another job."}
{"text":"Another hidden gem that I wish I could keep to myself delicious size of plates for a fantastic amount the food is quality awesome bakery whatever you want I'm sure they have best pastrami fantastic.  GREAT  for breakfast lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Love their gluten-free selections!  Both on the menu & in the bakery.  Great service even when dining alone."}
{"text":"Breakfast all day!! They have a built in gluten free menu which makes it even easier. Incredibly tasty home style potatoes. Consistently great service. I keep craving Chompie's since I've moved."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan.  It's a bit of a gimmicky restaurant without flavor.  They stack gobs of meat on bread that is below average.  The amounts of food are exaggerated and unappetizingly large.  Furthermore, it's stupid expensive for a sandwich.  My daughter and I had a sandwich each, french fries and one soft drink for $40.  Just give me a smaller sandwich that is prepared with love and talent and I would be happy.  I shall not return in favor of the smaller, mom and pop sandwich shops that prepare their food with passion."}
{"text":"Average food, average prices, nice menu, busy and good location.  Bathrooms and back hallway always smell and look filthy.   Maybe A Fresh coat of paint Would help!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have the best Reuben sandwich around town. I always get mine on sourdough and a side of extra thousand Island. At $15 it is well worth the price and a great treat.  Make sure to get it with pastrami as this is the best cut of meat that is so tender juicy and flavorful and completes the Ruben."}
{"text":"Pretty bad service wasted 15 minutes of my life on Christmas Eve sitting there with my son trying to order food. You would of figured for over priced food for you would of got decent service."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Sorry this review is so late. We ate here in November and it was fantastic. Writing a review now because we were just talking about it that how memorable it was. Our service was great for our large party of 15 and the food was AMAZING!! get the Jewish sliders wow so good. My kids loved there character cupcakes. Love there deli as well. We will be back for sure next time we visit Arizona."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast with my family around 8 this morning. Menu is large with three pages of breakfast items alone. I however chose to have non-breakfast (cup of vegetarian split pea soup and a half lite albacore sandwich). It was nice that lunch was available that early. Portions are quite generous. My brother had the biggest pastrami/corned beef/brisket sandwich I've ever seen. I submitted a picture. He loved it. Our server was prompt and steady. 
What compelled me to write this review was the bakery/deli section on the other side of the restaurant. I submitted a picture too. Dessert selection was great and everything looked delicious. I asked about a decadent looking chocolate cake and the very nice man running the deli took out a slice and gave me a large piece to sample. Then he gave me another chocolate pastry he thought I may like. After that I didn't need dessert! But we bought a few pastries to take home including a very intricate minion cake. This gentleman was so friendly. I think that is a great way to get people's business. All the desserts we brought home were very good. If I lived here I would come back again and again for the desserts alone."}
{"text":"Went back on Friday night, as the owner had reached out about my last review. Service was much better, food was good. Something is just different about the whole atmosphere in the evening."}
{"text":"I split the jewish sliders and pastrami (as recommended by the other yelpers on this page) and was absolutely delighted!  I love the pickles at the beginning of the meal, the fried potatoes inside my silders, the heaping mounds of meat in the pastrami sandwhich, and that huge, happy bloated feeling as I waddled out the door.  All in all, great service, great food.  Come hungry, eat lots.  :)"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed with chompies because I've enjoyed eating here, but today not so much! My friends and I came for brunch and it was packed ( which I expected) . We only waited for 25 minutes which wasn't to bad. I started off with a Bloody Mary and it was mediocre. I disliked the taste of celery every time I took a sip of my drink ( that was with me taking the celery out ). I ordered the French omelet which had bacon, mushrooms and onions. My whole omelet was covered in cheese which I had to scrape off and the food was dry. The only thing I enjoyed was my cheddar jalapeño bagel . On top of that our server was super slow with getting drinks, bringing out of our food and she forgot to bring our sides of salsa that we asked for.
I should have just gotten their egg Benedict like I normally do but I felt like trying something new and it wasn't worth the money."}
{"text":"On my trip to Arizona last Summer, I had a recommendation from my Aunt, to try this place. Upon arrival, I was pleasantly greeted, and seated promptly. I ordered, a Lox Bagel Cream Cheese. Wow! A huge plus, was that they use Philadelphia Cream Cheese, and the Smoked Salmon was very fresh! The bagel was slightly toasted(upon my request) and tasted very savory. It had a nice crunch on the outside, and was soft on the inside. An overall satisfying experience! I love this place! They also have a wide variety of other selections for breakfast!"}
{"text":"If you love Egg Benedict's like I do then defiantly come here for breakfast :) they offer  many different varieties of egg Benedict  and you can either get in a bagel or English muffin. My boyfriend loves the corn beef hash here and the different types of bagels they offer."}
{"text":"I am willing to overlook all of Chompie's shortcomings, like giving me a Pepsi when I order a Coke, long waits to be seated, sticky tables, etc. because of their delicious corned beef & pastrami.

Seriously, delish."}
{"text":"Fabulous deli in Scottsdale of all place. If it was in Los Angeles I would eat here every week it was in New York you would be world-famous everything was great including the service"}
{"text":"Nothing like a New York deli and restaurant. They have the best variety of bagels and the best cragel in town. Dozen choices of cream cheese, lox, deserts. Sliders are delicious and always a bright and welcoming environment.

{"text":"I've been a Chompie's customer since 1982, but this was my first visit to the Arrowhead location.  I moved to this side of town a year ago but it never popped into my head.

Cailynn was our server and she did a great job, the food was hot and I appreciated the senior manager kicking in to help out and bring our food out when our server was busy.

It was your typical Chompie's greatness, and close to home."}

Eve award: best non-burger sliders I've ever had

Highlights:
- Jewish sliders: tender sliced beef brisket on top of deliciously seasoned crispy potato pancakes in between 2 soft dense shiny challah buns. Top in with the gravy it comes with, and you're close to true bliss. Amazing!!! Though that man vs food guy tried to eat a dozen in a half hour--that's a bit much.
- Corned beef hash: one of my fave breakfast items and this is one of the best. Smooshed ground version with crisped edges but not processed tasting or too salty
- Fries: crispy wedges but potatoey soft inside. Fantastic when dipped in the gravy
- Brisket dip: twist on the traditional French the hub enjoyed
- Could take large groups: we had 16 and there was a party in the back room with 30

Lowlights:
- Some breakfast items have time restrictions: things like eggs benedicts are only served til 3pm (there was a crazy one I wanted to try on top of a potato pancake)

Had a great family meal here and would come back for those sliders alone."}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero or better yet get a new manager with proper skills to deal with customers. Im from out of town a d travel with our dog and called in advance to ensure it wouldn't be a problem, but we decided to eat inside and my dog started to bark while we waited for our food. He may have been nice enough to have brought her water but since i overheard him discussing my dog with an employee i said is there Problem..this jerk said it was a health code violation to have the dog outside, only service dogs are allowed, and she is barking at every customer. My dog is friendly and if she does bark, nobody was outside eating. She was behind railing so no threat to others as i know she won't bite anyone. So replace your manager because he made me so irrate i left immediately. Don't claim to be pet friendly when you clearly are not. Oh anf staff appropriately. You  leave your bar unattended for too long."}
{"text":"This place had so many great choices that I could barely choose. However, I was definitely happy with my final decision, see photos!"}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE the atmosphere!! Love the set up! My first time here, referred by a friend, all I wanted was French toast and it was DELICIOUS!!!! The rest of the menu looked great, can't wait to try other items!

The staff was friendly but I didn't care too much for them I just wanted the French toast!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Deep Blue Something - Breakfast at Tiffany's)

I'll say, we should go to Chompies
A coffee ground to start with
Or we'll start to fall asleep
I'll say, Adam from Man vs. Food was here
He did the sliders challenge and lost
Still I know you just don't care

And I said what about Breakfast at Chompies?
She said I think I remember that show
And as I recall I think, we both kind o' liked it
And I said well that's, the one thing we've got


Chompies has been serving East Coast style breakfast in the valley since 1979!  Located close to ASU Campus this place is packing with tradition and memories.  

Breakfast is served throughout the day.  Pick up some fresh made pastries and bagel on your way in or out!  Last first time came I ordered he All American Breakfast -- YUMMY! Crispy bacon, warm turkey sausage, crispy hash browns, and over easy eggs. I'm a sucker for good breakfasts.  The 2nd time I came I ordered the Breakfast of Champions.  Let's just say I wasn't a champion this time around.  I finished my eggs and bacon, but man those pancakes or ginormous!  I think I ate 1/3 even though I was trying to carb load for my run that day.  Eaters be aware; the portion sizes hard HUGE!  

The place itself is made like a deli shop.  I don't think much has changed since the open since it seem pretty dated.  It was fun searching for the different Broadway plays painted on the walls which brought back great memories.

Our service was excellent and the waitress seems to know a lot about the large menu.  Yes, not only were the portions huge....the menu itself was HUGE!  First timers I would definitely stay with breakfast.  You can't go wrong there! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stop in for dinner with my wife ordered a mile high sandwhich  with extra fries. What I got 
Was a regular sandwhich and extra fries in a cup . Very disappointed. This place has lost myself and everyone I can talk to about it"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I am from Los Angeles and know really good deli's.  Brents Deli in Westlake and Northridge, CA is the best deli ever.  They know what a corn rye is.  I have been to Chompie's and don't like their corn rye, or their pastrami, or their chopped liver.  It is sad that there really isn't much choice.  I will go there and keep trying but I have to order corn rye from Brent's Deli in Los Angeles.  Good bread is the end all. I went to Chompie's today  3/31/18 and wanted to get some lox to go.  I asked how much it was a pound and he said $40.00 OMG, I said you're kidding right.  He said NO.  Are you kidding me, I can go to AJ's or anywhere else and get a pound for $21-22 a pound.  Even in Scottsdale or NY."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Chompies!  I usually eat at the one in the Mall but when I'm on his side of town I always seem to find a reason to stop by B^)

I've never had a bad experience at Chompies!  They are very consistent with how they serve their food and their service!

Food~ It's a strong 3 stars for me!  I prefer their sliders ~ pastrami is good and their matzah ball soup, potato latkes are also good as well.  
Service~ It's always exceptional!  Everyone's very attentive and eager to help you find whatever deli item, your craving!  5 stars
Pastries~ Total 4-5 stars!! They have some amazing pastries, cookies, cakes you name it ~ they make it!!

Whether you have time to eat or not, I will always find a reason to stop by to eat in or pick up something to go because they are very good and consistent at what they cook and serve!! 

I hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"Mediocre service, mediocre food. Horrible deli counter service.  This is the second time I've visited since its grand opening at the end of May.  

I was really excited as other locations I've visited were fantastic.  Unfortunately, both of my visits have left me unimpressed.

The first visit, we requested a booth. While we were happy to wait for one, they seated us at a table despite several gentle reminders of our request.  

We ordered breakfast, an all American and a two egg breakfast.  The service was slow and apathetic. The food was served lukewarm.

Well, we all have our off days so I figured we'd try again and see if things would be better this time around. 

Unfortunately, it was a bit worse with the exception of our server. The food was served late, cold and with hard bagels.  

Despite this, I love their bagels so after we choked down our breakfast, we headed to the deli counter to pick up some to take home.  While waiting patiently, we were ignored  and passed over 3 separate times. It took a total of roughly 22 minutes to get 6 bagels.  When we were finally served, it was with all the hospitality of Lurch. Sorry to put you out there, buddy. 

Anyway, it will be an unlikely event that I will return. 

Fool me once..."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I am from Los Angeles and I have tried Jewish Deli's in Arizona, Compie's being one of them and they can't hold a candle to Brents Deli in the San Fernando Valley.  Chompie's corn rye is blahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"Had not been back to Chompies in quite some time after time after experiencing problems with service. Took a party of six people to the PV restaurant for dinner. The waiter disappeared and the hostess was kind enough to step up and take our order. She said she had never taken an order before. Apparently the waiter doubles as the bartender and became hung up with drink orders. 
Problems with service had not subsided. 
I ordered a full sandwich on rye bread - half corned beef and half pastrami. The sandwich tasted great but it was not the hulking portion from previous visits to thus restaurant either in PV, 32nd Street, or Tempe. Oddly enough, the sandwich included a large patch of inedible fat that I would have choked on had I not sensed something was off base. I will attach a picture. 
So the place is not what it once was from the restaurant perspective. From the bakery perspective, we bought rainbow cookies and mini seven layer cake on the way out. Very enjoyable."}
{"text":"I walked in with a friend one afternoon when there were only two other tables in the restaurant. There were two servers on the floor with not a whole lot going on. I'm very observant of other restaurant's customer service due to the fact I also work in the restaurant industry. 

With that being said, there was zero excuse for the lack of communication and customer service that we received from our server. She had one other table that was closing out their check and she briefly walked by our table and said she'd \"be right with us\". Fifteen minutes later, we finally got our order in. 

The only reason why I gave this an extra star is because our food came out fine, no mistakes in the order, and it arrived at our table in decent timing. After that, our server never came back to check on us nor was she walking around the floor for a good 45 minutes or so. Eventually, our server walked right by us but we had to flag her down for our check...which of course, took about ten minutes to get. 

Customer service is important guys! This isn't the first complaint you have gotten about lack of communication between the servers and their customers either."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. I haven't had a good experience with Chompie's lately and it's not just this location. The service is ALWAYS a hit or miss. I walked in last week when it was pretty slow and the two ladies standing around at the front didn't even say a simple \"hello\". I asked them if we had to wait to be seated and without answering, they looked at each other with a smirk and nodded at the hostess to \"take care of us\". 

Not the most welcoming feeling. When a customer asks you question, you answer their question. Simple as that. I've been in the restaurant industry for awhile and I would never \"blow off\" or make my customers feel unwelcome the minute they walk in. 

Our server was alright, except for the fact we didn't get a single drink refill until she handed us our check...which implies that she didn't stop by to check on us at all. But hey, at least the food was on point."}
{"text":"We come here pretty much every weekend!!! We are partial to their Belly Lox and bagels! So good, and large portions. The kids love interacting with the staff and getting a cookie with their meal! Great family environment, staff makes you feel as though you're coming for a family breakfast!"}
{"text":"I went once to Chompie's up in Scottsdale, but this place has them beat! We actually stopped in on a Sunday and they were so crowded (I would have waited, but I was too hungry), that we came back on Tuesday. It was lovely because nobody was there and we got the whole dining area to ourselves. But the best part was just the food. The service was pretty good to say a little more.

I had trouble choosing because the menu is quite extensive, but I finally chose an artichoke spinach omelette with a bagel on the side. I was in bagel heaven. My friends both had sandwiches. My partner had the beef brisket and said it was to die for. My girlfriend had a pastrami. It was piled so high she wasn't sure how she was going to add her mouth around it. It was flavored just right and she said it was amazing. They also bring a little plate of pickles to put in the middle of the table. The cool thing was there was several varieties. 

Lately I have been out for breakfast or brunch several times and this is the best omelette I think I've had in a long time. It had succulent artichokes, lots of spinach and just a really good fresh flavor with spice. My bagel was toasted and buttered. Even when I was almost full I completely finished it it was so crunchy and chewy. I live in Tucson and I haven't been able to get my bagel craving satisfied. This one did it for me. I'll be back for sure!
In fact, We all left quite satisfied."}
{"text":"It looked good and o read good reviews on the place. We showed up at 1030 am on a thrs morning for breakfast. Unfortunately I can't tell you how the food was, other than the complimentary pickles that they brought with our water when we first sat down. 

We waited for over 15 min while several servers passed us by without speaking. We never got spoken to orthat served and afterleft 20 min wewhile finally we got up and left."}
{"text":"Excellent and huge corned beef rueben sandwich for lunch. Came with plenty of delicous and crispy wedge-type fries. Reminds me of Katz's in Manhattan. I'm pretty sure there were at least a few people in the witness protection program in there enjoying food from the old country (NY)."}
{"text":"Ok, so out of all the restaurants in Tempe this is the one I miss the most. Why you might ask? THEE best Eggs Benedict I've ever eaten!! Before eating Chompie's Eggs Benedict I was never a big breakfast person but after my first bite I was craving this dish at 7am, 12pm, and 6pm all the time! I have to admit though I have only had the Eggs Benedict and some chicken wrap thing from Chompie's before.. the chicken wrap thing ya, whatever, but Chompie's gets 4 stars from me just for their dish that made me a breakfast person. Go order yourself the best damn Eggs Benedict..NOW!"}
{"text":"I am annoyed. 

Let me be clear, I've purchased dozens of bagels from this Chompies and they're always good. Big, fluffy with a little exterior crunch. The ordering process is simple and quick and the price is low.

Yet, I am annoyed. I came in this late morning for a breakfast sammich. I ordered an everything bagel, toasted with a fried egg and sausage. I don't get down with the cheese. I get my sammich home and open it up and am immediately annoyed. Hence, why I'm annoyed. 

I will attach a photo, but allow me to describe. The bagel is burnt on the inside edges, like Black. The egg is overcooked, not hot and runny like it should be. And the sausage is literally the size of a silver dollar. It BARELY covers half the bagel. I mean, come on. I ate most of it, but it was dry, with no salt or pepper or any seasoning beside the bagel itself. The sausage tasted like nothing. So annoying. 

I will continue to buy bagels from Chompies, but I will never order anything else. 

And some old lady cut me in line after hovering over my shoulder for five minutes. Back off lady! Grrr."}
{"text":"I'm a Phoenix native and whenever I am home, we go to Chompies. My daughter loves Chompies bagels. So much that she calls bagels \"chompies.\" I got her hooked on the bagel bites because they sell them in Sprouts out her in SoCal. 
Took the whole family and everyone was happy. This is a place you can take that has somthing for everyone."}
{"text":"Chompies.  Always a must when in Phoenix.  My son can not hear. I without the mish mosh soup and I just had the best egg white omelette ever."}
{"text":"This is the best deli that I have been to in Arizona.  The portion was good size, but also a little expensive.  Service is pretty good and it is kid friendly.  The breakfast is also worth stopping in for however it gets busy so those coffee refills slow down.  We also stop by and get desserts for the holidays from the bakery that follows the good but expensive theme.  Overall, very solid and best deli in Phoenix by a mile."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, but waiter service kicks it to 4. I feel the need to go back again to confirm the four or maybe it is just the idea of more pastrami. I really was not expecting a lot given the stop was for mere convenience but my wife and I enjoyed our meal. I as mentioned knocked out their pastrami sandwich and she had the Jewish sliders. The sandwich we both agreed was the stand out dish and for both of us, the sliders just missed the mark a bit.  Oh I forgot to mention, they provide complimentary pickles that were awesome. I have never started a meal with a side of pickles but must say they were yummy. Our waiter for the night was very helpful and funny (Arthur ?). We enjoyed his company. Overall, a good meal but still not sure if it is a 3 or 4 star joint."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but overpriced.  Waitstaff was attentive, which I appreciated. The main reason I won't go back is the prices - you DON'T get what you pay for....."}
{"text":"I wish we would have found this place sooner!  For Mother's Day this year I was craving French toast. After seeing some good reviews for this place we placed an order for pick up. Even though they were crazy busy, our order was ready in 15 minutes. BEST French toast I have had at a restaurant! Since then we have come here a once for breakfast, once for lunch am once to pick up some of their delicious desserts. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Was here for lunch last week with Rand H and Mike C.  I had the reuben sandwich and it was just okay.  I was a little disappointed because for $14 for one sandwich with fries, I was expecting something great!  Sorry, this is just way too pricey for just an average reuben.  I had it with pastrami and it had good flavor, but the sandwich could have used more sauerkraut for sure.  The fries were good!

The best part was the deli on the way out, they had bags of day old bagels and bialys for $2.50 and I snagged a bag with some lox cream cheese to take home.  I'd go back for the lox cream cheese, it had chunks of lox and wasn't all ground up like lox spread I have had before.

I wouldn't go out of my way to go back here for a meal that's for sure."}
{"text":"Horrible don't give a cr*p service. The worst I have experienced in any restaurant here in the valley! The manager Gary is an apathetic weasel with no customer service skills. Anyone want to buy a $25 gift card from this dump?"}
{"text":"Aghh, has all the ingredients and few of the moves :(. Service crazy slow, anything i needed today was like asking a favor. Had to ask for the complimentary muffin bread even. Had to ask for water refills, inattentive. Omelette  is ok, but the latke was oily and undercooked, bagel was BURNT, which is unacceptable to me. It's like everyone working here is lethargic & doesnt give a shit."}
{"text":"Love it, as always. 
Chopped liver on rye, hot pastrami, chicken soup. 
Don't forget a box of cookies to go."}
{"text":"Way overpriced. The pastrami sandwich was good though. It had a good flavor, but I can't justify $12.99 for a sandwich and a little cup of potato salad. Now I'm not just talking about this sandwich. The rest of the menu was overpriced as well. Even the kids menu. Items on there were up to 8 or 9 dollars.

Service was ok. Seems that there are better places to spend your money than here. Like fancier places..."}
{"text":"It is expensive.  A sandwich is 16$   Breakfast is around 12$ 
Although it's pricey. It is good food. And fresh. They use boar head meat.  The bakery is good too. 
It's a place we come to for a good sandwich. We pay 30$ easy in NY for a lb sandwich.  So I'm sure the cost is right on for phx."}
{"text":"Karen was an awesome server! She was very nice, helpful, and a joy. She made us feel very welcome and offered great food recommendations. I wish all restaurant servers were like Karen. Chompie's would have a name for itself regardless of the appearance on Man vs. Food, thanks to her character. I hope to have her again the next time we are in town. 

If you are looking for meaty, substantive sandwiches, this is it! They do breakfast all day too. Amazing french fries (steak fries/wedge shaped) with a light crispy batter."}
{"text":"I had the hot pastrami on sourdough it was really moist and the coleslaw was amazing. I will return to this place. Thank you"}
{"text":"This is the best Jewish deli!!!! It does take a long time to get in for brunch, especially on the weekends. Be prepared to wait, but it is so worth it. They have a deli/bakery you can peruse while you wait.

The servers are a bit stand off-ish, but that kind of adds to the NY feel of the deli. They have breakfast all day, as well as lunch/dinner options. I've had both, but today went with savory.

I started with their matzo ball soup...amazing. It's homemade, with light and fluffy matzo balls, a wonderfully seasoned broth, and carrots and onions. 

For my entree, I had the Nike high pastrami on rye. It was probably the largest sandwich I've ever seen in my life/ the homemade rye bread was excellent, and the pastrami was so well done and lean!! I could barely finish the sandwich given it's size!

One of the best brunch/breakfast options in Phoenix. If you're really hungry try the slider challenge that was featured on Man v Food."}
{"text":"Trying to get Chompies to create my wedding cake but for some reason the store manager Adam doesn't know how to return phone calls. Almost 2 weeks have gone by and 3 messages left and no return call. Their Arrowhead location the cannolis are soggie so we came to the one in Scottsdale where they're made and they were really good and fresh. About a week later went back and the cannolis were like the ones at Arrowhead, soggie and the cream was dry. Horrible"}
{"text":"Our trip to Chompie's yesterday started out with us requesting a table on the patio. (When we came in, we saw some folks sitting out there) The hostess told us she wasn't sure if they were seating anyone there, and since that seemed like a hint that they didn't want anyone out there, I told her we were fine with sitting inside. (The dinning room was pretty stuffy, but I know better than to anger waitstaff at a restaurant) We started with a potato knish, which was reheated, but tasted okay. We both ordered extra lean corned beef sandwiches, hers with matzo ball soup, mine with fries. Both of us found the corned beef to be greasy and fatty. (Don't know if this is always their extra lean, but it didn't seem like extra lean) My GF said the broth to her soup tasted lime Campbell's, and matzo ball was bland. My fries were actually potato wedges, but okay none the less. Overall I would say this a pretty disappointing experience. I will wait for my visits to Chicago and Florida for real Jewish deli food."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place from other people... so on a trip to Arizona I knew we needed to make a visit.  And boy was it worth it! So much food! Our waiter was fantastic and filled our every request. We went during breakfast and the menu was huge. They served our table free sliced chocolate chip bread that was to die for. I tried the Cabo Skillet which was spicy just like I love. Everyone at our table left stuffed! We will definitely make another stop to enjoy a sweet treat from their cake/cookie counter."}
{"text":"Really good food and great alternating specials. They are friendly and engaging to you while they are serving you. My family and I really enjoyed our visit there and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. I always order the half Reuben and Cabbage soup. More times I get fatty pastrami and cold soup. On good days they serve me good quality meaty pastrami and hot soup. Service is slow. No matter what, I still like coming here."}
{"text":"Went here for Christmas Day lunch with my husband and another couple. Chompie's was featured in The AZ Republic as being one of the few restaurants open. We went at noon and there were already 15-20 people in front of us waiting for a table. Not surprised about this, so we were ready to wait.  Customers kept coming in and tables opened up but no one was getting seated. Finally someone in our party asked what was going on.  They told us that they were behind in the kitchen and not seating anyone until they got caught up.  More people kept coming in to the point where there was no standing room left. People started walking out. We asked if we could could sit down even if we knew we weren't going to get served soon.  Was told no--that's not what they do. Finally a waitress came over to seat us because we had \"already made a fuss.\" Really!!! Is that what you tell a customer. They explained that they were short handed because of the holiday. How about staffing up when you know you are going to be slammed on a holiday???
Food finally arrived. My soup was cold as we're my husband's French fries. Sandwich ok. Other couple seemed ok with their food. Overall, took almost 3 hours to get out of there.
Every time someone has suggested Chompie's in the past, I cringe because of their bad service. And this was beyond bad. And the rude, frustrated staff didn't help. Buy some good Boar's Head from your local grocery store and save yourself some headaches and time and make your own sandwiches at home."}
{"text":"Was in Zona for a wedding and went on the hunt for a breakfast joint. Settled on Chompie's and was not disappointed. I had the Athens skillet which was tasty. However, it was loaded with garlic, so be forewarned if you plan on making out with some hottie after breakfast! I also tried a pumpkin bagel which was delicious with plain cream cheese. I think the pumpkin cream cheese would have been overkill. Till next time!"}
{"text":"Edward is awesome!! Took such great care of us!!  Ask for his section!  Food is good and portions are huge.  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for Saturday brunch around 11:00 or so... 20 minute wait for a party of five. 

They have a nice selection of bread, bagels and cookies to take home after you eat. The loaves of bread looked really awesome! I'm definitely going to add it as a stop in my grocery shopping circle. It's conveniently located on the way to the Chandler Costco.

The Baja Burger 14.99 is ridiculous! It could easily feed 2 people or just a hungry teenage boy.

I ordered a half turkey sandwich and had to take a lot of the turkey off so I could actually eat it. Next time I'll order a half and extra bread to make another half. 

The menu is huge so there's something for everyone. Great choice for breakfast or lunch! $5.00 mimosas!

The check in black and white cookie was so sweet it literally hurt my teeth!"}
{"text":"Always a good bagel spot. Good service and predictable quality each visit."}
{"text":"High priced and the food has gone wrong. It used to be a place to get a decent bagel, but they somehow ruined even that, and on top of everything else the service is awful. I ordered a couple bagels and soup to go and was the only customer waiting and it still took almost 20 minutes. Actually, I am still waiting. 
I was introduced to Chompies over a decade ago and since then they have lost their way. At least try and make a decent bagel again."}
{"text":"We have been going to this Chompie's for many years now and the the service has gotten progressively worse. Today we were told the wait would be 15 minutes, it ended up being 45 minutes. They could at least be honest about it so i can make a decision. Being busy is one thing but this was ridiculous. To make things worse, at least one party of similar size was seated without being called out. Nice! The only reason I give two stars is because our waitress Ashley was awesome as always. There are a lot of new breakfast places nearby that have awesome food and don't treat you like this. I won't go to Chompie's again."}
{"text":"On the first day of Hanukkah my true love ordered me..... 2 challah sliders with latkas and a matza ball soup.

Yeah, so it's the first day or Hanukkah and we wanted to try Chompies.
We arrived at 11am and it wasn't busy at all. We were seated right away.
Everything was clean and neat. 
Our waitress was kind and took our order right away.
 Our party ordered latkas, challah slider meals and an all you can eat corned beef hash with a bagle on the side. 
We waited for about 15 min until our meal was served.
I must say....those little challah sliders were AMAZING. 
Super fresh challah buns, meat was piled high and a little latka on the bottom was just heavenly.

 If only Chompies would start selling challah buns now. They would be amazing for hamburgers.

Enough about the challah sliders, the matza ball soup was really good too. 

The matza ball wasn't your average ball. It had a different texture and it was so light and fluffy.
Why do my matza balls always end up being heavy when ever I make them homemade? Hmmmm....

Anyway...everything tasted wonderful. I had to take one of my sliders home since it was more than enough to eat.
Everyone was completely satisfied.
I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I've gone here twice and had good experiences both times. Service is a litle slow so I wouldn't come here if you are in a hurry. But, what I would recommend is to come here and enjoy the extreme deliciousness that is Chompies.

I've had the Jewish sliders (which are incredible!), the knish, cheese blintz, pastrami sandwich and the chicken matzo ball soup. MUST HAVE THE MATZO BALL SOUP!! I did feel quite full after sharing a large bowl though so prepare for a lot of soup. The knish I had was the potato and onion. I liked it but it was very one note after a while. I had a few bites of my boyfriends mile high pastrami sandwich on challah bread and it was divine!! The challah bread was sweet and amazing and the pastrami was perfect! The blintz is a good sweet dish but also savory. Probably wouldn't come here if you are on a diet.

Prices are decent, decor is cool and the bakery walking in/out is amazing. They also serve Dr. Brown, which is great soda if you've never had it. Good food, good location, good experiences. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in specifically to try the brisket sandwich and Jewish Sliders.  The menu is great and I'm hoping the brisket is half a good as the Ruben Sandwich I had in my last visit. We came back for dinner and my wife tried the Knish and I had the chicken noodle soup with matza ball."}
{"text":"Can you get bagels to bring to work at 6:10 in the morning only three kinds of bagels are available don't plan on coming here to get bagels for Work"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place, been here many times and every time
have had wonderful service and the food is the bomb! I usually get the Matzo Ball Soup and
my wife got the Patty Melt. I also love that they have Coors Light on draft (a nice touch). We will be back again when we are near ASU."}
{"text":"This is a great local business in the Phoenix community! I love the breakfasts they have here. I've been here more than several times and make eating off of their breakfast menu a habit during dinner time-it's just that good! I'm a big fan of the challah French toast...eggs are super good too. There's also a full-service bar where they play the games on TV. 

A tip to Yelpers out there: they have an active check-in offer where you can redeem a free bagel with any take-out purchase. Definitely a steal, especially if you're coming into the PV mall and wanted a breakfast pastry to go."}
{"text":"Chompie's is a straight up Tempe classic and there's a reason it's been Around for so long. Food is good but nothing amazing in my opinion and it's usually insanely busy. I'll go if a friend wants to but it's never my first choice."}
{"text":"I cannot believe how lucky I am to have a Chompie's down the street from  my house! If you have never been, GO NOW! This place is absolutely amazing. I have never had anything I did not enjoy."}

i Had the Turkey mile high sandwich it was great and so was the black/white cookie my husband had the ultimate jewish sliders and an amazing bowl of matzo ball soup i will def go back !!!"}
{"text":"Any place that makes you wait shouldn't just throw some chairs and a bench down the hallway.  I'm not sure which is more uncomfortable.  Obviously the owners have never sat there.

It's this we don't really care attitude that permeates the whole place.   One day you get a juicy corned beef sandwich and then next day it's filled with some fatty pieces that are closer to dog food than people food.

I have better luck with food during the weekday than the weekend.  At least I don't have to sit and wait.  Maybe they can't handle a rush.  Do yourself a favor and turn around if they say it will just be a few mins."}
{"text":"This Chompie's location is perfect for a post-workout meal... especially if you're competing in one of the races that takes place at Tempe Town Lake.  The menu is huge and there is something for everyone.

Some of my favorites include the fitness omelette, (egg white omelette with turkey, spinach, mushrooms, green chiles, and tomato, topped with fresh parmesan cheese and served with fresh fruit salad or cottage cheese plus a bagel); french toast, matza brye, matza ball soup, bagel and lox, and huge yummy salads.  I could go on and on but it's better if you just go check it out yourself... and portions are big, so it helps if you work up an appetite first!
.  
****There is sure to be something for your sweet tooth as well - homemade fresh cookies, cakes, pies, and more!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to this Chompie's location... and just like the rest of the Chompie's I've been to, it goes to the category \"Best Deli in AZ\" - still not New York, and I think I may even prefer Goldberg's in Atlanta, but in Phoenix, Chompie's is the place!

We were there for dinner and I did order one thing that I never ordered from Chompie's before... Sweet Potato Fries!  Yes, Chompie's has pretty good sweet potato fries - yay!  I filled up on pickles and I also had a salad and a scoop of their whitefish salad.  (I probably would not order that again).  

Stick with knishes, bagels, sandwiches, and even omelettes - you'll be pleased.  Oh - and I cannot forget their soups... especially matzah ball and kreplach - yummy!  And if you have a sweet tooth, there is PLENTY to choose from!

Now I'm craving Chompie's again... I have to figure out which location is closest to my new digs!"}
{"text":"With limited Jewish Deli options to choose from in the Valley, Chompie's  is at the top of my list when I'm craving matzah ball soup, potato latkes, bagels, black and white cookies, or quality sandwiches served with plenty of pickles!  I've ordered bagels in bulk from Chompie's before but until this past weekend, I'd never taken advantage of their catering options.

I'm typically a planner, but this year, the Jewish holidays came around way too quickly, and I found myself scrambling at the last minute to feed approximately 20 guests at a break-fast on Saturday evening.  I went to  the Chompie's website and found their catering menus for the holidays...  I called and ordered a sampler platter for ten (this came with egg salad, tuna salad, white fish salad, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, cream cheese (veggie and regular), a small fruit plate, and a  chocolate babka...  All of this was conveniently ready for me to pick up Saturday at 1pm per my request.  I added to the order last minute , just to make sure I had enough food,  and the folks at Chompie's were fine with that.  They even helped me carry everything out to my car.  

Turns out, we had way too much food; portions are huge!  But everyone left our house with full bellies and many with leftovers for the week.  I'm actually kind of bummed that I'm traveling this week as Jared will get to enjoy the leftovers without me...  

Needless to say, I won't hesitate to use Chompie's for catering again in the future!"}
{"text":"We only ordered take out, so this review is not for the restaurant side of Chompie's. The bakery is Amazing!!! The selection is amazing and everything we ate was fantastic. We ordered breakfast bagel sandwiches the last 2 mornings. Great service. Their biscotti was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Had food here several times.  Always a blast to be in New York City in Phoenix.

Portions = enormous

Price = easy on the old credit card

Food =  mmmm mmmm 

Dave the manager observed us pondering what dessert to take home.  He did what I appreciate, and assumed the sale.  We left with $21 in desserts."}
{"text":"Adam is a great server.  Food was served quick but not with the panache as the PV mall location.

Ordered the same item at both locations, received different food at both locations.  Regardless, food was great.  Service is great too.

Nice to support a local biz too.  Do the right thing, buy some goodies from the bakery on the way out.  :)"}
{"text":"Sunday morning, the boyfriend and I wanted to get breakfast at our favorite spot, Chompies. I knew it was Late Sunday morning, so we didn't mind a bit of a wait after riding our bikes down and asking for a table inside. Hosts were great as always, quick to seat us. They have people that make sure you get ice water right away...

Here is where I started to have a problem. Two waiters zipped around the tables behind us, in front of us, next to us. A table sat AFTER us got coffee, orders placed, etc. We waited patiently, still, not even drink orders. (Let me also say, I'm a waitress and I know servers can get busy) So we thought they didn't realize who's section we were in, the guy or the girl. We waited some more. I watched and flagged someone down, letting her know we hadn't been helped yet and just wanted some coffee. She said she'd let our waitress know. 5 minutes, she gets our food order, I asked for a cup of coffee. 5 minutes later, still no coffee. I got up and went to the front, nicely asked if we could sit somewhere else because our server might be new or too overwhelmed but I just really, really wanted a cup of coffee. 

They moved us, I still had to wait another 5 minutes for someone to bring a coffee cup and creamer. Here's the part that angered me.... They Still had the same waitress bring our food and bill over 20 minutes later. I really should have asked for a manager, but we love their food and I understand people can be new/make mistakes/etc.

Food was good, so we left happy after the whole ordeal. What made me decide to log on and write this review was that same night, I ended up getting pretty sick, guessing it was the food. I don't think I'll be going back to Chompies anytime soon.... Which makes me sad, because I loved their Gluten Free Bagels..."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite to eat for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Convenient if you just want to grab a snack.  The service is quick and friendly; the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"What can I say, can't stay away lol.  Breakfast tacos were good. The brisket is amazing and the cabbage rolls a homey tradition were outstanding! 

Tried again today  so wanted it to be really good again but a las soggy potatoes and over cooked scorched eggs.  Our server was great. For a breakfast place they really need to be able to make decent eggs.  If I'm paying $13.95 for eggs  I expect a decent cook. I think we'll pass next time for breakfast anyway.  

They excel at brisket"}
{"text":"Holy crap!! So freaking good! 

Large plates and sandwiches. The bakery was amazing. So many sweet treats!! 

The pastrami was perfect!!"}
{"text":"The red velvet cake was good and the Jewish sliders were pretty tastey... but this place only gets 3 stars from me because the prices were far too expensive for a casual spot that looked like it needed a good cleaning.  I'd rather go to a clean fast casual place with reasonable pricing!"}
{"text":"Will never go back, took 50 min to get food, was luke warm and dry meat, very stale bread, forgot side that we ordered but charged for it. The word of the day from the waitress was \"so sorry.\" Then to top off the night, there was a roach in the bathroom. Need more be said?!?"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say this, but this recent visit started with being seated then waiting for over 20 minutes without as much as being acknowledged by waitstaff. Noticed several waiters walking past us and gathering at FOH with little to do. We decided to go elsewhere and not chance things getting worse."}
{"text":"I grew up in New England with all my family scattered throughout NYC. One of my best childhood memories is of visiting my grandmother in NYC and getting bagels from the bagel shop a couple blocks down. Being in Chompie's was a blast from the past. The smelss of the food and the memorabilia on the walls reminded me of my childhood visiting family and eating delicious and authentic NY style bagels. I live near by and love walking to Chompie's like I used to do in NYC as a kid."}
{"text":"Love love love their bagels! Sesame and whole wheat are the best for sure!
The veggie and veggie lite cream cheese are amazing! Very flavorful with slices of green onions and carrots, it's my favorite on top the sesame bagel. The blueberry cream cheese is also a treat, it tastes freshly made and not fake. Bagels are large and the perfect texture of chewy and crunchy (when toasted!). Deli is very fast so picking up a bagel takes only minutes. I've eaten here for breakfast as well and they have a nice selection of goodies. Their pickles are also top notch. Mmm I often miss Chompies!"}
{"text":"I love chompies. The potato pancakes are to die for. Chocolate chip pancakes are also great. I've never really had anything but breakfast. That is mostly because I love their breakfast. Try the bagels too. Strawberry cream cheese is a nice touch."}
{"text":"My family had a wonderful breakfast at the Chandler Chompies yesterday morning after not being here for at least a year. We used to go every weekend for a couple of years, but the wait became too long. We tried it again & were very happy! Only took about 10 minutes to be seated, service was great, and food was wonderful. My little boys love the pickles!"}
{"text":"I used to think this was a solid 3 star place. But not anymore.

I've left the Valley officially as of last week and was sad to go. Before I left, I made it a goal to eat at my favorite places, with Chompie's being one of them.

I hadn't been back to any of the Chompie's since Adam Richman had made a stop, but the last time I was there was back in January...and I really don't recall the prices being as exorbitant as they were last week. I know they weren't.

Price gouging aside, the past few times I've been the service has been really...bad. I'm saying bad because I don't feel like swearing, but let's say excrement-y, ok?

I arrived with a friend in tow - we were hungry. The hostess seated us promptly and was very friendly. A guy brought water by...and we sat. For ten minutes. Ten minutes. We made eye contact with 2 servers. No one came by to take our orders.

We ended up leaving. What a pity. I was willing to blow money there for some sliders, too.

Since they didn't want our business, Crackers and Co took it....plus, I saved a few dollars and actually had someone taking my order in under 10 minutes...with a smile."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast food ever!!! This place rocks! the line on the weekend can somtimes be a little long but it is defintiely worth the wait. Huge servings of food and awesome bagels for low prices. Chompies is one of my favorite breakfast places and a great place to grab some food with friends especially the morning after a night on Mill ave."}
{"text":"Eh, this place is just okay.  My partner is from NYC and was hopeful he'd found a place that could make a pastrami sandwich like he eats at home.  He was disappointed and my veggie chili was just okay too.  Not on my list of places to return..."}
{"text":"The service is going down the drain. What happened the food is good but the people who work there are not friendly at all."}
{"text":"Never had Jewish food. Amazzzzzzzzing!!!!! Western sliders are sooo good!!!! And the desserts all looked beautiful!!! German chocolate cake and carrot cake are reallllllly good!!!! Will definitely be back!!! So glad my bf brought me here."}
{"text":"Foods usually good, service still sucks.  Painfully slow.  Don't get the beef brisket.  Over priced."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today and was very pleasantly surprised. Though they were very busy we were sat within ten minutes. The food was very good and our server was excellent. Her name was Beatrix and she took exceptional care of us. I wish there were more people like her. She truly made our visit a memorable experience. We saw Lovey there today also and wish we had told her how nice this server was to us."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Jewish food. Where else can you find matzo brie, lox and cheese blintzes?? This place! I really love Chompies. Jewish comfort food like Matzo ball soup just can't be beat. Some stuff is gimmicky, like the Jewish Sliders, but it is all still tasty. Portions are BIG! Service is friendly. I've been coming to Chompies since it was located on Greenway Rd. I believe the prices were better and the food fresher at the old location. The new location has greatly expanded business, and is beautifully decorated...... but seems like it came with a price to consumers. Exactly how much overhead am I paying for? Still a go to for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner- whatever. It is always tasty and a good time.  

*I must add- Chompies has an EXTENSIVE bakery- one of the best in the valley I'd say. They also have a fantastic deli to boot. This is a GREAT place to buy bagels, cream cheese, black & white cookies, and rugalach (sp?)"}
{"text":"Whenever you have a craving for breakfast during the lunch hour, this location is by the paradise mall. Ordered the two egg and side dish meal. Went with the deliciously flavored corn beef hash with sunny side eggs."}
{"text":"Gets very crowded on Sundays, but what did I expect? The bagels are good (the everything bagel is my top choice). Expect anywhere from 15-20 minute wait. Meanwhile you can look at the bagel assortments and order a dozen to-go right at the counter. 

I was disappointed to not be able to order the chicken matzo ball soup because they didn't serve soup until 11 a.m. But I consoled myself with the salmon lox with all the trimmings on s toasted everything bagel. 

Staff is congenial and the one young lady we got was super thoughtful and made sure she checked on the status of our iced tea and coffee and was quite prompt at refilling them."}
{"text":"I wish we had a kosher deli in my neck of the woods, because some days, I just have to have matzo ball soup. Or, the quintessential lox and cream cheese on an everything bagel, toasted, with all the trimmings--slices of red onions, capers, tomato, the works. 

But there is none in Yuma.

Thank goodness, Phoenix is just a 2 1/2 hours drive, give and take another half an hour in construction traffic. There a several Chompies in the metropolitan Phoenix area, but we tend to go to the one in Scottsdale, for some other reasons.

* Salmon Lox and cream cheese on an Everything Bagel--quite expensive! But to me, it's a worth an occassional splurge. Though I never paid that much for a bagel sandwich back East, I am grateful that it is relatively closer.

*Matzo ball and chicken soup--the kids and I adore this. The broth is perfect, although on ocassion, I thought it was a tad bit salty. But all in all, still a winner.

* Hubby gets the Pastrami---piled high, good, what else can I say.

I was tempted to shave 2Stars (!) off my general rating--for the fact that service can be sporadic, and on one trip, was downright horrid. The girl ignored us, and we could see her chatting with the other girls (although I'm thinking this happed at the Chompie's on University, and not the one in Scottsdale?).

But to be fair, for the food ALONE--a well desserved 4Star rating from me. 

Chopped liver, anyone???"}
{"text":"Went to Chompies today for the first time.  My first thought was -$16 for a sandwich! What the heck?  Well let me tell you.  Two people could easily share a meal.  The sandwich was huge!  There much have been a pound of roast beef on it.  The french fries are amazing!  They have a huge display of sweets too.  I didn't even look because I would have got one of everything.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the iced tea tasted a little old."}
{"text":"Many years ago my son and I stopped at a Chompie's for an early breakfast. They were not busy. The waitress was slow and rude, the food was cold when it got to the table and I swore never to go to a Chompie's ever again. Fast forward about 15 years and Rand talked me into trying them again and we met at this location. I can't tell you what I had 2 years ago but I do remember that the food and service made a good impression on me. Recently I attended a Yelp event at the one in Arrowhead near where I live and got to try several items and liked most of them. I am always looking to try different places for an early morning breakfast and reading the menu I spotted Dave's Deli Benedict with latkes and corned beef and had to try it. I came over to this location in PV mall because they open an hour earlier than the one in Arrowhead. The combination turned out good but not great but that means I can try something different next time. The service was good also."}
{"text":"First time ever trying Chompie's and I was very satisfied. The food was great, the waitress was nice and quick food came out just as fast as I order it which was great. I order the New Jersey sliders and them bad boys was BOMB.COM. Got my daughter (2 years old) a slider from the kids menu can't remember what kind but she smashed it which is another plus cause she's a very picky eater. Prices are good to me. I'll be back (Terminator Voice)"}
{"text":"Their food is good their prices are a bit high. My husband always gets the mile high sandwiches and can't finish them.  The service is hit or miss.  Usually the staff ignores you after the food arrives.  So make sure you get all your condiments the second your food arrives or you need to make peace with eating your food cold or without the condiments of your choice.  I keep eating here for my husband.  When he is gone this place will be dead to me too.  
If you like my reviews follow me on yelp."}
{"text":"Every morning I wake up and look outside to a future I know I will never have.  The vast emptiness of life becomes crippling.  Chompies helps numb the pain with a delightful assortment of baked goods and tasty food."}
{"text":"The egg salad is terrible....so sweet.  But my next visit, I tried breakfast!  WOW!  They cook eggs perfectly!  I only get breakfast now!  It's great here!"}
{"text":"People go here and expect a good deli sandwich but Chompies has really become a restaurant.  The sandwiches have shrunk in size over the years.  The meat is good quality but my fries were only warm not crispy.  I am not going to take the time to send them back.  .Inconsistent food."}
{"text":"Im so glad Chompies is in Peoria. Their food is always consistent. They serve pickles, great pickles, while you wait for your food. My favorite?- their sliders. My husband and I have tried each one. Yummy. They also have crispy onion strings which are worth the splurge. They have an outdoor patio too. While the weather is nice, sit outside!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service. So many options too! Love the complimentary pickles on the table when you dine in. I went for the salad/soup combo this last time for something light, whereas my husband enjoyed (and lucky for me, shared) the stuffed French toast. Holy moly it's huge and indulgent. 

My pick: Order the bagel and lox, but order it as a plate where you build it yourself don't forget the capers. Yum."}
{"text":"Hi Chompies! You're the fantastic! Your Chorizo Con Queso is amazing and so is your bakery (rainbow cookies are bomb). I love the environment, your helpful staff, and GOOD food!"}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is a great expression to describe this location. Not all Chompie's are created equal - our waitress was nice, but my hubby ordered the \"tuna melt\" but it came with no cheese, so it was more like a tuna....hm. what do you call that? He also ordered an egg cream, but they were out of that - not a big deal, but my hot chocolate didn't come with the whipped cream it was supposed to come with, so that was lame.

I ordered 2 original pancakes {can't really mess that up} and I got eggs on the side, with melted cheddar cheese. They have  DELICIOUS syrup and gave me as much as I needed.

If you end up dining at this location, just stay on top of your order. You might need to ask if they are even carrying what you want, before you order it."}
{"text":"I was greeted as soon as I walked in.  I was sat in the back area.  The server took a long before I got my drink order taken.  The menu is HUGE!  I settled on the high mile pastrami sandwich with fries.  It was good but not the best I have had.  The roll was a little harder than I normally like.  The service was OK."}
{"text":"Was there last night. I have been going for over 25 years.  Had the most disgusting meal I have had in Scottsdale for a long time.  Corned beef and cabbage which used to be a favorite of mine was the biggest pile of inedible fat I have ever been served.  I needed to vomit it up this morning. I would have complained then and there but did not want to embarrass my friends."}
{"text":"First, thank you Wendy for reaching out and letting us give Chompie's another chance.  It was great!

Food was superb (lots of leftovers to boot!), service was excellent and we will definitely be back.  Thank you for changing our minds about Chompie's!!

Regards,
Rachelle"}
{"text":"I normally give this place 5 stars. Not this time. Our server Susan was very rude. Had to flag someone else down for a coffee refill. And at the end of it she just put the bill down and said \"here\". We felt as if we were a bother to her since we were not one of her regulars. She was very nice to others refilling personal cups with coffee and making small talk. Will make sure if I go back not to sit in her area"}
{"text":"I have been a Chompie's fan for many years!  Whether I am stopping in to pick up a bialy and an iced tea or sitting down to grab a sandwich in the restaurant.  The triple deckers are awesome!  I can't get a Rueben anywhere else because they are never even close to as good as Chompie's!  Service in the restaurant can be hit or miss.  We have had the best service, and other times it left more to be desired, but it has never been bad.  Definitely suggest stopping by the bakery and grabbing a dessert to take home for later!"}
{"text":"We loved the breakfast all day. The apple pancakes and bagel skins platter were both delicious. The portions are huge and prices are reasonable. Excellent service too! We're here for a week's vacation & definitely plan to return before we leave!"}
{"text":"I had eaten breakfast twice at the Chandler Chompies and loved it so I wanted my husband to try them.  However, we went to the Tempe location instead.  Much older restaurant (pretty worn) and it took some time for me not to be grossed out by the nasty overall smell of the place.  My breakfast wasn't half as good this time and my husband didn't like his either - just boring and not repeatable.  Hoping he'll give me another shot and we'll make the drive out to Chandler next time."}
{"text":"This location rocks...so much better than Tempe.  I've had breakfast here twice.  The basic ham and eggs breakfast was good and I became a fan of the potatoes.  My friend had the Athens Skillet so I tried that the 2nd time.  OMG it was so good.  It will be hard to try anything else since I already crave a repeat performance.  Would be 5 stars, but I took home eclairs for my family and they were so blah that one just got tossed out."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!  Delicious!  We happened upon this by accident and loved it. It's busy, hoppin' even on Thanksgiving. The man at the door said its always like this (\"We've won so many awards, we stopped hanging them up!\") but we were seated right away. Our waiter was very efficient, but cool. The food was varied--the hash browns are definitely fresh, not frozen--and there's TONS of it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing in every way. Menu is huge and everything I have tried is so good, from the buffalo chicken sandwich to the massive pancakes, you can't be the portion size and taste for your buck. Probably the 6th or 7th I've eaten here and I will continue to come back. Their dessert selection is fantastic as well. The red velvet cake and brownies are delicious. Service has always been good. My favorite place to have a cheat meal, hands down."}
{"text":"Kind of overrated - I'm feeling like if I went there 5 times straight in a single week, I might even downgrade them a star.

I second the other Yelpers in saying that everything looks absolutely amazing the first time you come here - the menu is a haven of Jewish deli classics and can be a bit intimidating to the hungry individual wanting a taste of everything.  Servers are super friendly and hustling around toting enormous portions of delicatessen delights - the place has a really cozy feel to it.

Tucking into the food, though, nothing is mindblowingly good so much as straddling the line between yummy and blah.  My standard of a cup of matzoh ball soup, half a pastrami sandwich and an egg cream was a nice meal, but I had just hoped that little things could have been better to elevate the meal to the next level.  Case in point, the matzoh ball itself was bursting with the flavor of schmaltz (chicken fat - essential for a great, traditional matzoh ball) but the broth was so flat, I found myself seasoning my soup at the table.  Or the pastrami - can a girl get a little moister pastrami and a little spicier mustard?  Maybe I'm being a nebbish, but everything deserved a B- when I so hoped to give it an A+++

Jewish sliders are worth a try only once - it's an intriguing combo of brisket (bland), latkes (crispy and light), jack cheese (wish it was swiss for some reason and gravy (delicious!) on challah rolls that goes down smoothly but then proceeds to expand in your stomach like someone's blowing up a balloon in your innards.  Not so pleasant.  I officially know why Adam Richmond had to throw in the towel on Man v. Food - it's pretty aggressive how filling those little suckers are.  I guess if you are a champion to the likes of Joey Chestnut, go for the all-you-can-eat sliders action.  Mere mortals, stick to the basics and leave with your pants intact and not bursting at the seams.

Straight meh, says I."}
{"text":"So, much like in the movie \"A Christmas Story\" our dogs ate my planned dinner of cornish game hens. 

That meant we needed to scramble find a place for Christmas 2016 dinner.  Chompies was open and we called.  We confirmed that if we arrived before 6:30pm we would be seated.  Upon arrival at 6:10pm we were told that we would not be seated because the management had changed their minds about seating times.  We explained that we had called and were told 6:30pm to which we were told we were out of luck.  Now, typically this would have been an inconvenience but tonight we had our 89 year old grandmother with us for dinner. 

I immediately asked to speak to the manager and was visibly irritated.  A manager came out and I requested to speak to Mitch, the general manager.  Mitch came out and immediately apologized for the inconvenience, the misunderstanding and assured us that all would be handled.  The hostess staff informed us it would be approximately an hour before we would be seated, so we waited.  About 15 minutes later we were in a booth and ready to go.  

Drinks were served in a most timely fashion and dinner was fantastic!!!  It took a bit to get there bit  it was Christmas and the place was jam packed!!!  Absolutely will be back!  Mitch brought our food out and was an absolute gentleman!  We thanked him, apologized for our irritation and wished him a great holiday!  

Mitch - I'll be calling tomorrow to say thanks again, but you sir are amazing and a gentleman!  Thank you for saving Christensen Christmas dinner 2016.  Damn dogs."}
{"text":"This restaurant had some good reviews so we decided to stop in while on vacation in Arizona. 

We ordered the Motza (I think...?) balls to start and they were different. I've never had them before so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. They were okay. 

I ended up ordering the grilled chicken Caesar salad for lunch, and it was huge. The chicken was a pricey add on, but well worth it. They definitely didn't skimp out on the chicken. I really liked my salad. 

My mom got a salad with salmon on top. She liked hers as well. 

For desert we ordered a mini cannoli, and a mini chocolate mouse cake to split. The desert was sooo good. I really enjoyed both of them. 

They have tons of deserts, like cookies and cake here. Even bagels. It all looked so good! You could even order take out here. The next time we come back to Arizona, we will definitely stop in again!"}
{"text":"We ate at Chompies & had 2 oversized breakfasts for less than $20.00!  Daniel is a fantastic waiter so please as for him!! Thanks Chompies. See you soon."}
{"text":"For the service alone In have to give it a 5.....some of the best staff of anywhere I have been.  We went for breakfast and everyone in my family had something they liked....which is rare.  The Apple pancake was very good and the vast amount of baked cookies and treats was great.  Thanks for a great way to start our day and vacation."}
{"text":"The best hot tongue sandwich I've had since the last time I was here!  Really satisfied my hankering!  Great pickles included!
Also great pastrami and corned beef.  Oh, and cannoli"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food-- pastrami sandwiches and clam chowder, but the place could use a good cleaning--top to bottom. Excellent cheesecake at a bargain price last Friday night."}
{"text":"I have NEVER been so disappointed in this place. Normally I get amazing service and exactly what I want. Today was not the case. I asked for my usual with extra spread, and it was abysmal. I have always gotten what I wanted and offered to pay extra which I am never charged. However today if it were any lighter on spread, I would need to order more to cover the bagel. Please listen to your customers and give them what they want. So disappointing. I even offered to pay extra it's not a problem. Perhaps if you don't normally work in the deli area, you shouldn't be helping out."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here last Sunday because it was hubby's birthday and they give you a free breakfast on your birthday. So it was myself, hubby, and our daughter. We were seated promptly and our waitress took our drink orders. I ordered the Lovey's Smoked Salmon Tapas and absolutely LOVED them! They were 4 potato pancakes (latkes) topped with sour cream, sautéed Nova lox, and covered with the traditional chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and capers. The latkes were thick but still crisp and the flavors were all perfectly balanced. Very filling too! I can't wait to return to have these again! The free breakfast hubby received came with 2 eggs, hash browns, and your choice of a bagel, toast, or  English muffin. Hubby also ordered a side of corned beef hash to go along with it. He said everything tasted good and he had no complaints. I had a bite of his corned beef hash and I totally agreed with him. Plenty of corned beef and seasoned really well. Our daughter had a skillet breakfast and she enjoyed it although she did make a comment that it was a little dry and wished she had not requested the gravy on the side. Service was great and the sandwiches that were being served to other customers while we were making our way out looked absolutely amazing! I can't wait to return - now I just have to decide for which one first - breakfast or lunch?!"}
{"text":"I recently came for brunch with one of my girlfriends and her two young kids. 
Our server was very nice and helpful and the manager stopped by the table also to make sure everything was up to par. It was great! 
My friend and I shared the bagel breakfast skins and the Bobka crumb French toast. 
The bagel skins were so good. It's two bagels open faced with eggs, cheese, bacon, onions and potatoes. It was so good! The sour cream on the side just made the dish perfect. 
The French toast was our of this world. Amazing! I've never had such great French toast. The Caramelized bananas and the whipped cream on top made it so decadent. It was rich and sweet. 
Both dishes were quite large and great to share between the two of us. 
The kids each got a kids meal with some special requests and everything came out just as it was asked!! 
Always great food and great service!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I love the fact that I can have AMAZING Jewish food and I didn't have to cook it.

I always order a bowl of matzo ball soup to bring home with me to eat the following day, we never finish our food but I like the left overs. 

Its crowded, more so on the weekends,  but have you ever been to a deli in New York? They always seem to be packed, sometimes with lines out the door. The crowd doesnt bother me. 

The only thing that really irks me here is we have regularly had bad/slow service. Like a drink never refilled or a side of something we didn't get that we served just before the bill after reminding them. So I am a little more agressive about flagging down my service here. 

Again, I love it, its comfort and home food that I don't have to cook. I don't have friends who cook Jewish food, so this is my only shot in AZ unless I'm making it myself."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! If you want to be served by a moron, go to Chompies. The service counter at this restaurant provides an example of HOW NOT TO TREAT A CUSTOMER. I dont care how good their food is (and in my opinion its mediocre at best) I have boycotted this restaurant and so have at least 5 other people I know - ALL w tales of their HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE PARTICULARLY AT THE SERVICE COUNTER. Dont waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"My co worker and I came in here for lunch, I ordered the Times Square New Yorker pastrami sandwich and fries.. Good stuff, will definitely be back with the fams!! They have a menu full of food, I think it's 4 pages long. I might have to try everything here..lol"}
{"text":"Tasty food and quick service. The price was a little higher than I'd prefer for lunch but the portions are hearty. I really enjoyed the chicken and matzoh ball soup. The pastrami and corned beef sandwiches were also very good."}
{"text":"Ordered an egg salad sandwich.  It was okay but bland.  Would try something else next time if there is a next time.  Also the sourdough bread requested was not sourdough received."}
{"text":"Amazing place to grab a bite to eat. The food is always good and the pastry and cookie selection is awesome."}
{"text":"As a Baltimore-D.C. resident who moved to Cottonwood Arizona, I immediately lost touch with REAL kosher style food.... until a friend told me about Chompie's in Phoenix. The wife and I ate lunch there yesterday, and we felt like we were in Katz's Deli in Manhattan. We feel that it's worth the drive of 90 miles to get this food. My bubbies when alive couldn't make food any better. Our lean corned beef and pastrami sandwiches along with matzo ball soup were amazing!  The owners are almost 90, and they still come to work.   We had ribbon cake, and had to get more! The chocolate chollah bread was made into French toast at home today. Yum!! Folks, this is the real deal!!! Enough said. Don't be a nudnik and stop by for a nosh. Steve Garner...p.s. make sure to get an egg cream here with the real Fox's Chocolate syrup....p.s.s....I was a restaurant manager!"}
{"text":"Oh well. I give up. The Arrowhead location is not up to Chompie standard's. I've been there a dozen times in the last six months. The manager is really trying. However, they are consistently short staffed. Consequently, there is a long wait while the restaurant sits half empty due to not enough staff. Once seated, the wait for your food is really long. The food itself is often inconsistent, orders are missing items or wrong items delivered."}
{"text":"We have relatives in town and went to Chompie's. Zach was our waiter and he went above and beyond to help everyone with their orders. Zach was polite, friendly and was checking in with us to see if we needed anything else throughout the time we were there. The food was great and was even reasonable for all of the food you receive. Great place to go too with many choices so everyone can find something they want. Can't wait to go back and really hope we have Zach as our waiter again!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 8 times and really want to like it. The service always lacks. Last week, we had the same blondie waitress that I believe another reviewer refers to - a scraggly haired blondie at that. We got there at 5:00. Scraggly took our order at 5:15. Then we proceeded to wait ... we ate all 5 pickles alloted for our table, drank all of our water without straws, despite the fact that we ordered cokes - which only arrived after they were delivered to another table???

Meantime diners all around us came, ordered, ate and left. Finally I caught Scraggly's attention and asked when we would be getting our meal, as the tables around us came after us and were already served. She replied, \"Those aren't in my section - and it's busy in here today.\"

Not sure what that had to do with anything. It's a restaurant sweetheart, it's supposed to be busy. And anyone who has half a brain, knows that sections don't have kitchen hierarchy. The tickets are prepared in order.

Needless to say, Scraggly forgot to place our order but didn't want to admit the truth. But AHA!!!!! When the bill came, the time stamp on the ticket was 6:07 - approximately two minutes after we inquired about our lost meals.

We confirmed the time stamp as the time the meal was ordered in the kitchen, with the little cashier - Yep, that's how the kitchen keeps track of whose meal gets prepared first.

Sorry Scraggly - NO TIP FOR YOU!!!

Chompies food is not bad but the service is consistently is (BADDDDDD)
I'm sure there are plenty of ASU kids who comb their hair and have positive personalities. Chompies needs to hire them."}
{"text":"What can you say about Chompies that hasn't been said already?!

A lot!

First off, I miss the 32nd St and Greenway location, being from Moon Valley. That was my first Chompies experience years ago,  with the super nice Vincenza runnong the front and making sure you were well taken care of! 

I grew up in NYC and have eaten at all the famous Jewish delis and the not so famous ones in the Jewish neighborhoods that you never hear about but are awesome. I also lived in Hollywood and ate at all the LA spots like Canter's, etc. So, I know deli. 

The new locations are less homie than that old one, but the food is still very good. My go to sandwich is the Rueben, which is piled high with delicious meat (my fave is pastrami, not corned beef) that is slightly fatty (Jewish style, not Gentile style!). The Russian dressing is the best,  and to change things up now and then, I'll get cole slaw on my sandwich instead of sourkraut. Try it, you'll love it!

The soups are always in house made and very tasty. You can't go wrong with a soup and half sandwich deal, either.  

Hungover or just in the mood for something sweet for breakfast? Try a plate of matzoh-brah, broken up matzoh bread soaked in scrambled eggs and then fried in a pan with a sugar finish. My Italian grandmother even made this for me growing up,  it's a NY staple. 

The pastries, although not made in house like the delicious bagels, are very good quality too. A little pricy, but very consistent! And you can't beat the selection of cookies and pastries. There are \"bakeries\" here in town that don't even have half the selection of Chompies! Their cakes are very yummy too, so don't hesitate to order one for a party or special occasion. 

The bagels are in the top 3 in town (out of respect for the Chompies crew I'll keep that top 3 to myself)! For many years they were the only spot to get real NY bagels that were very good and consistent.  They still have the best bialy bagels in my opinion. Be warned,  the Chompies bagels they sell in the supermarkets are not the same. They are commercially made for a longer shelf life. Not really true NY bagels. 
Lovey and crew have been doing it right for many years now, so go pay them a visit and enjoy some real NY Jewish food, even if you are Goyisha!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST BAGELS IN TOWN. The chopmie bagel in the grocery store are different then the ones at the restaurant deli. Go to the restaurant and get them.  I like this place for many reasons but dislike for many reasons as well. The food is great,  Best bagels ever, unreal sandwiches. All the servers act like they would rather be somewhere else and the prices are way to high. The pastry counter always looks so good but everything in there is stale and has been sitting out for to long. A sandwich can range from $10-14, for a sandwich, um, there good but a little expensive for a sandwich. I will never get bagels anywhere else, but as far as eating here I will do it cause its good but if the prices were a little lower I would be a regular. And the hostest with the short black hair needs to lose her attitude. She also needs to do something different with that hair of hers. lol"}
{"text":"First off, I ask for at least one thing when going out to eat and the rest we can work on. Get my drink order right. I'm not the type to order something crazy, at least not for drinks, but I find watered down drinks disgusting. The server at chompies did the one thing that gets me in a bad mood, add ice to my soda when I specifically ask for no ice. 

Now, it is the first time I have even gone to chompies and the menu was very lengthy. Not something that I mind but every sandwich seemed to have coleslaw on it. I was actually quite surprised about the entire homey atmosphere here as I always envisioned chompies to be like einsteins. 

Once the food came out I discovered that when the menu said horseradish they meant the sauce kind. There seemed to be a long wait for our food and it was cold when it was served. They also gave fruit instead of the requested Coleslaw with my boyfriends sandwich. 

Taste wise it was decent but nothing spectacular. I don't think I will be coming here again any tim"}
{"text":"Love the - All You Can Eat : Fish & Chips. The bestus deal for a Friday night dinner. The bagels are fantastic also"}
{"text":"Totally agree with the reviewers who have had similar experiences with slow staff, especially at the front counter and noticed the general - for lack of a better word - dismal atmosphere. I won't say dirty, but it sure doesn't give the impression of spic and span one likes to associate with a food establishment.  I once asked a young woman at the checkout if this location was going to undergo a renovation to look similar to the Paradise store (i.e airy, bright, well-kept) and she looked shocked - informing this store had \"just\" been renovated....ten years ago. I really wanted to ask if that was the last time it had been mopped and vacuumed, too, but I just grabbed my hefty priced order and left.  I've not really been back, except maybe to grab a bagel when I've been too lazy to go to a nearby elsewhere location.  In their favor, there aren't that many Jewish delis in the vicinity, so if/when the mood strikes for a kosher hot dog or pastrami on rye, Chompie's got it, so have to hand it to 'em for that...."}
{"text":"I went in to Chompie's this morning on the way to the hospital. The weekends are the only time they make whole wheat flagels. As a person who eats almost no bread, I let myself have this treat when ,
my dad is in the hospital which is usually twice a year. Long story short, no flagels but I was told it would be 20 minutes. I was offered a drink and cookies which I politely declined. I was ok just waiting..........the owner gave me 2 cannoli's on the house just for waiting. 35 minutes 
later no flagels! It was all good I was in no rush. However, the owner handed me the flagels and my veggie cream cheese on the house. I was totally willing to pay, I knew I would be waiting. That's great customer service, as a server and a manager in a restaurant, I know how important that is. Thanks guys!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite soups and sandwiches. Such a big menu so you will never get bored on what to order. The servers are always amazing and are very professional. So happy that I love so close to this place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed...Took my daughter to get the Salmon spread and bagel since I've had it before. This time something went very wrong. The bagel was dry and undercooked the spread was tasteless and the prices went bad! They charged me $12.33 for the bagel and 2 can sodas. The young employees are lazy and confused. I will never take anyone back."}
{"text":"Kids night is fantastic, thanks for getting us parents out of the house to enjoy some real food.  

Chompie's should never drop below 4 stars.


Shame on you people."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  My first visit at 6:30am on Saturday customer service was spot on. Yesterday afternoon however was another story. On a walk with my one yr old and I ran inside to get her a bagel to snack on. Stood in line under the 'order here' sign for 15 minutes the girl at the register then managed to disappear after she helped the ONE customer in front of me. After being skipped by at least 4-5 customers going to the 'pay here' sign that woman decided to finally help me. Very very lazily got my bagel for me while pausing to have a great conversation with her coworker across the restaurant. All the while I think he was the manager was oblivious to the whole situation or just didn't care. Restaurant was dirty everything is way too over priced for the service you get by these rude girls. After waiting in line for 20 minutes I needed a beverage yet no one there willing to assist me - should have walked out. My advise - go to one of the other many options in a 1/2 mile radius where they don't treat customers like crap."}

{"text":"Just ate lunch w my son. First time ive eaten here, really  wanted to love it. The service was pretty bad. Thank God for the busser if not for him we would prob. still be waiting for our drinks. The food was ok."}
{"text":"I really wanted to really like this place.

I have gone there twice during my visit here...

First off, when asked what you would like to drink, if you say water, it's a bit alarming when the waitress asks (tells) you, are you sure you wouldn't like a lemon in that water?  It's cause the water they serve tastes terrible.  Seriously.

Second, I'm a huge fan of Kreplach soup.  So when I saw it on their menu, I got rather excited.  That excitement didn't last for long.  The Kreplach looked like they were mass produced, all identical, not hand made.  They were skinny.  Don't bother ordering it.

If you order a half sandwich, the cole slaw that comes with it, well, you need a magnifying glass to see it... really, why provide a serving in a thimble?  It's a shame, cause the cole slaw actually was good.

The corned beef sandwiches were ok, they seem to get pleasure out of their size... for $13 or whatever, I expect them to be big.  They were good, not great, but good.

The entrance is a dizzy array of the check in area, the register area, the take out area, and a merchandising area.  The seating area is pretty plain.

All in all, if this is Tempe's definition of a wantabee Jewish deli, it has the advantage to most places away from the two coasts, but it really doesn't pass the appearance or taste test.  Better than none, I'll concede that.

But disappointed, perhaps cause it bills itself as something it's not..."}
{"text":"Their lox cream cheese is to die for! I could literally eat it with a spoon. Their bagels are good as well. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they seem a little pricey for the dozen bagel/cream cheese bundle."}
{"text":"Phillip is an excellent server. Thorough and quick. I loved his ease of delivery and he promptly provided us everything we needed. Thanks for a great meal today. 

The food was great too! You can never go wrong at Chompies."}
{"text":"They have decent Jewish Rye bread. It went downhill from there. Wife and I went for lunch. I ordered roast beef on rye. The menu says rare roast beef roasted daily. What I got was brown. It was piled high as advertised for $16.00. The meat was tasteless. It came with cole slaw, I've had better slaw at any fast food place. There wasn't even a pickle. Do yourself a favor and go to Goldman's if you crave roast beef. My wife ordered corned beef hash. It was mostly potatoes, and topped with cheese. She ate half of it and bagged the rest. She will probably toss it even though we almost never throw out food.We decided to buy a loaf of rye bread but the five loaves they had on the display rack all had expiration dates of yesterday. I inquired if there was fresh bread  and the deli counter guy brought out a loaf dated three days from today. We bought it. We had planned to buy a knish but after our meal changed our minds. All in all it was a disappointing experience and we will not be back."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and i like better the new york style sandwiches than the sliders...

The sliders look better on the Man Vs Food show..."}
{"text":"Awesome mini Jewish sliders, and I don't care for a show about a fat guy stuffing his face it just seemed like a menu item I would like and most definitely did. Also as with any Jewish deli worth it's salt they provide you with pickles before the meal, and their pickles are awesome. They vary from being really salted and pickled to not so pickled and they give you refills all the time. Also their potato latkas are also pretty good, just make sure to get apple sauce; and everything I have had on their breakfast menu was delicious.

Now the reason for the 4 star review is this place can get busy and when it gets busy the waitresses service is usually not all that great. One time I had to wait an hour for my food (breakfast mind you) and the waitress didn't refill my drink for 45 minutes, I mean I had to flag her down and ask for a refill. Oh well, I try to come here when it's less busy and I would recommend you to as well."}
{"text":"We were passing through after staying close by for a conference. Wasn't expecting to stumble across a New York Jewish Deli but they delivered a great chopped liver sandwich and latke! The kids menu was good too and staff very pleasant!"}
{"text":"Been a big fan of Chompies.  But today was not a good experience.  The restaurant was not full but still a ten minute wait even with empty tables.  Staff appeared to be short-handed.
I was seated in a booth next to a few older guys.  Later I found out one of them was the manager.  They were very loud and boisterous.  One of them yelled across the room to get his friend's attention.  One was also dropping the F bomb repeatedly even with ladies in the immediate area.
Did his mom not teach him any manners?  Apparently not.  I asked to speak with the manager and told him their behavior was unacceptable for a restaurant.
I was mistakenly charged for six desserts after having just one.  Server corrected my bill but the extra wait made me late back to work.
Probably going to be a long time before I go back to that restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is full of goodness. I quite the finicky eater and there at least two dozen things on the menu that I am anxious to try. I've been here a few times and never been disappointed. 

Yummy food. Good service. Decent though not great prices. A cool NYC theme atmosphere. Thumbs up to our own Valley original."}
{"text":"I did not like Chompies for dinner. I ordered the chipotle ranch burger and it lacked good flavor and the meat tasted dry and old. I felt like they tried to cover the bland taste with tons of ranch. Yuck. Anyway, not sure if I will come back but if I do, it would be for breakfast."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and wait staff. Edward has been our server twice and was excellent on both occasions. We are definitely on Team Edward! Highly recommend for brunch/lunch. Try the Josh's French Toast and Breakfast Sliders....super yummy. :)"}

The joint can get busy on the weekends, so we prefer to come during the weekdays when it's slower.

{"text":"Tonight was only our 2nd visit to Chompie's Deli and we are pretty solidly sold on the greatness.  Our family of 6 (nearly all native Arizonians) enjoyed trying some New York and traditionally Jewish foods.  The service was wonderfully attentive especially the manager Christopher who went above and beyond to take care of us when my husband's order arrived undercooked.  The helpings are enourmous- seriously you can eat all weekend on one entree- and there is so much to choose from it is hard to pick- especially the dessert options.

I personally had the Orignal Jewish Sliders with gravy and I LOVE LOVE that dish- the flavors and textures are all perfectly comfortable and delicious.  

We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Server was great, sliders were disappointing as the meat was barely there so would suggest to do the sandwiches.  Asian salad hit the spot."}
{"text":"Absolute best New York-style deli I have ever been to -- you HAVE to try the Hot Pastrami Sandwich and the Jewish Sliders! Melt-in-your-mouth incredible. Huge gluten-free bread and bagel selection, and they don't taste like cardboard, AT ALL. Don't forget to ask for Robert to be your server, he's amazing! Hands-down best service, best food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"There was a whole gluten free menu for breakfast. It gave me a wide array of options to choose from. The gluten free french toast was pretty tasty because of the bread they use. 

The one thing that was weird was someone in my party wanted a breakfast sandwich that was listed at the deli and the server said he couldn't order it with the rest our breakfast order. He said breakfast sandwiches needed to be ordered at the deli counter. My friend had to go to the deli and order the breakfast sandwich and then bring it back to eat at the table. It was pretty inconvenient and inefficient since my friend got his breakfast before us and we didn't get to eat our breakfast together."}
{"text":"I'm a convert! Tempe Chompies rocks! Used to go to Scottsdale, but this place is a whole new experience. Calm, gracious and yummy! Picking up my holiday order without a smash of anxious people around me was a first! If you want yummy deli food served by nice people in a gracious environment, this is the deli for you. My new favorite Chompies!"}
{"text":"Always have a pleasant time at Chompie's. Staff is friendly and the food is quick and delicious. It's great they offer gluten free options!"}
{"text":"Always great food at Chompie's. I really enjoy receiving my 20% discount for being a US veteran."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Chompie's in many, many months and having just gotten back from NY, decided we needed a fix. Ordered the roast beef sandwich w/fries and turkey slides w/potato pancake and cranberry, soup and coleslaw.

The roast beef was dry and dark.  It lacked flavor.  The slider was fine.  The mayo was dripping out of the slider.  The barley/mushroom soup was salty yet hearty.  

Service was quick and seating was fast.  We received the wrong bill and that was corrected quickly."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good but I will never be back. Our waitress was super nice and did nothing wrong. One of the skillets we ordered came our undercooked. We did not want it and the manager would not take the skillet off the bill. She only agreed on taking off $3. So we had a meal we couldn't eat but had to pay $9 out of $12 for it. Terrible customer service on the managers part. We will never be back"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, I was looking forward to trying out Chompie's since all my friends have said that I would love it. When I walked in, I could see why - The decor was New York themed, with the Yankees taking up a whole wall in the back and Broadway posters lining the walls by the bathroom. I sat down and looked at the menu, where I saw many familiar offerings.

After receiving my food, however, I was disappointed. The Chopped Steak was bland and tasteless. I could not finish it. My friends that ordered other dishes didn't seem to like their meals either. The salad was okay, the fries pretty good. I would not come back for the food.

The service was lackluster too; waitresses did not refill the water often enough, and my friends soon resorted to sticking ice cubes in their mouth while waiting.

Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Visiting family in this town we came here for breakfast. The place is really nice inside and they have a lot of options for fresh cookies, bread, and desserts. 

Service was nice, but I would have to give this place 3.5 stars. The food was not good for me. I ordered the Arizona eggs Benedict and felt the bagel it was on was too dry and hard. I was wanting something softer and buttery with the egg. My hubby got a different eggs Benedict and said his was too salty. My girls pancakes were very cute, but overcooked. 

We took some cookies to go which definitely is the highlight here. They are super buttery and delicious! They are dipped in chocolate with sprinkles, yum! We took an elmo cupcake to go from my daughters to split which they loved. Next time I visit I'll try something different and hope from a better outcome. Cookies are good though!"}
{"text":"Been going here for several years. Used to be a fun, quality, place to eat. We always try to be objective but after three consecutive bad experiences...we're done. Service is miserable, quality has faded, portions have shrunk, and they just don't seem to care anymore. The pastry case is beautiful, but hopefully you're just there to look as it's almost impossible to get anyone to serve you. Don't waste your time or money. And I've read several reviews regarding the horrible attitude of the older gentleman at the front. They're absolutely correct. Either fire the guy...or make him retire."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, not a great experience. We still had to wait forever for a seat, then waited forever for our food. I ordered the same thing as I did before, bagel with lox. It was gross. Nothing was fresh. My red onion was translucent, like it had been frozen and defrosted. The whole thing was just unappetizing. Bummer. At least last time the service and the food made up for the wait. Not so much this time :/"}
{"text":"We have gone to the Arrowhead Mall location for lunch several times.
Every time we have visited the food was great! I have had half of the pastrami sandwich with a cup of the matzo ball soup. The sandwich was more than other venues that offer said fare. It was piled high and I had to take it home.  I was not familiar with that, but I must say it was delicious! 
The seven layer cake was ordered \"To go\", as I could not eat anymore. It was very chocolaty. I enjoyed it later at home with a cup of coffee. The mere slice was huge. My chocolate was abated for the next 2 weeks. 
The service was very good. We were seated quickly. Our server was attentive and answered our questions, He knew what he was talking about. 
I have had the the salmon and lox. It was delicious. Again the portion was more than adequate. I had to opt for a take away container. Chompie\"s is by far the BEST deli that I have visited.
Last, but certainly not least must talk about Thanksgiving Dinner They offered a fully cooked dinner. I invited 8 people. It was 10  including my husband and me. I was a bit nervous, because in the past, I ordered the dinner from a local grocery Store. The food was gimpy and mediocre at best. On the other side of the spectrum, Chompie' came through. Dinner included a whole turkey, sweet and mashed potatoes, String green beans, stuffing, a light giblet gravy, a regular gravy, cranberry sauce and 2 pies. My guests raved how good the food was. I was a tad put off that hubbie  let the cat out of the bag, and gave away the secret! Best of all the entire dinner was able to be cooked in 30 minutes. Including tax, dinner was about $235.00. There were plenty of left-overs. All the food was freshly prepared (including the turkey).
I was put off about the 3 star reviews (and lower)....
This restaurant is my go to establishment for great fare. Try it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a kid reminds me of when I grew up in New York love this place."}
{"text":"The food was good,  but the service was very poor, so that is three reason for the 2 star rating.  

Mitch, the manager,  had to do way too much to \"make things right\". Mitch was great and needs better staff behind him."}
{"text":"Yeah, Chompies is good. This location is huge with a bakery and a restaurant. Food portions for some items are waaaay too big for my taste. Unnecessarily big. Even my turkey burger was crazy big. Fries served today were cold =( Server was attentive, helpful and flexible. Burger was good all the way around; but not memorable. Sandwich I had on my first trip was also good, but not memorable. Service during this visit was definitely memorable. Oh, and I love black and whites from Chompies. Not the way I love them when I'm in NY, but I still love them here."}
{"text":"Definitely try the Jewish Sliders. They're awesome."}
{"text":"A decent deli but not terrific in the opinion of this Cleveland resident and Brooklyn NY native. Humongous portions- a half whitefish salad sandwich was a thick layer on a whole bagel. Husbands half salad was similarly giant sized, and a friends omelet took up most of a large plate. But the bagel was meh. Salad was fine per my husband. Checked in and got a free large black and white cookie which was pretty good but I like them crunchier and not so soft. Pickles were excellent. Husband got a chocolate covered pecan pie slice that was too sweet and heavy for me (and I love pastry) but he thought was great. Quick service and nice and cool in there."}
{"text":"Very horrbie, I came in for the good Friday special I was told they were out of fish if they know there were going to be out why didn't they double up be ware don't come here"}
{"text":"Went to lunch today at Chompie's can't say if I'll ever go back, by far the worst corned beef sandwich I Have ever had. Actually it was not eatable and they comped the meal. And it took 20 minutes to get it with a cup of soup."}
{"text":"We had to travel from Florida to Scottsdale to get good Jewish deli style food. We went on a Saturday morning and it was super busy. We waited about 20 minutes for a table. The parking lot is NUTS!!! Be careful driving around on a weekend. 

I had Neal's Deli Trio... big portions, super fresh, very tasty. Coffee delicious. 

Of course the desserts are nuts! :)  Bagels are the best you can find in the Phoenix area. I love the veggie cream cheese. 

I took one star off because it is so pricey. We spent a small fortune on \"brunch\"."}
{"text":"Went to Chompies last night(Saturday) and waited a few minutes for a table which wasn't bad considering they were not that busy. Had 3 adults and the grandson with us and overall the server was good. We ordered two Reuben sandwiches a salad and kids breakfast item. The Reuben sandwiches were both cold, no melted cheese or 1000 island dressing. For 16.99 and from a New York style restaurant I would think they would have gotten this right. NOPE! Like others have said, first impressions mean a lot and when nothing was done to fix the sandwiches, NEVER returning to this location. Used to go to 32nd Street location all of the time and then had crappy service when they moved to PV Mall so stopped going there. Looks like the same thing at Arrowhead Mall too!! Sorry Chompies, was hoping for better!  Looks like it's back to the other delis in the area with just bland food but at least it is made right and hot. When the side of Cole slaw is the same temperature as the hot sandwich, that is not good."}
{"text":"I honestly loved this restaurant and this location for a couple years. I never had anything but a positive experience, but then a change occured a few months back. First, it was subtle, a few menu items changed pages or went missing from what was a frankly over-sized menu in the first place, so nothing to worry about. Then, one day the menu had changed from 6 or so pages with extra inserts for even more items to 3 pages in total. This was a welcome change at first, even if it meant losing some items I actually liked.

As we looked closely, however, I realized slowly that almost nothing was missing. They had crammed in margins on every page, taking at least two pages of menu items and practically hiding half of them in the margins. This was not a good sign. It said to me they were almost entirely doing this to reduce the cost of printing menus. It also may have resulted from complaints from the employees, which were starting to become noticeably aged. I'm not saying that an older man/woman can't be a good waitress, but when a restaurant suddenly goes from 90% wait staff in their 20s to 90% women in their 60s it just says to me again that they're cutting costs.

Now, cost-cutting is part of doing business, because you can't always make enough money and that demands action. But that would be with a failing or struggling restaurant. This Chompie's location, however, RARELY had open seating from sun up to sun down. It was always packed with paying customers, so they clearly had no need of cutting corners.


This brings me to the food itself. Chompie's has gone from the most consistently delicious deli-style food in town, to hands down the worst. This occured within the span of 2 months, which I can only assume coincides with a change in management. It's so bad, now, that during my last visit the Jewish Sliders which normally come with a rich, thick brown gravy were instead served with a blatantly cut gravy served lukewarm at best. It was so thin, that by comparison, if it was the same gravy at all, it would've been 10% gravy and 90% water, which I wish was an exageration, but it just isn't. You could see the bottom of the cup through it! And the brisket, which is normally cooked to perfection was clearly microwaved and so old I wouldn't be surprised if they pulled it off other uneaten sandwiches.

This is the new quality of this chompie's location, and I would warn anyone to stay away and let them go out of business, because they're no longer interested in having customers. They've proven that much."}
{"text":"Tonight was our second time at this Chompie's and had I written this review after our first visit, I would have given it 4 stars.  However, after the service we received tonight, we will not back.  After reading other reviews, one can only assume that the Borenstein's have made so much money that they could care less about what kind of service their patrons get.  

We arrived around 5:00pm and the restaurant was not very crowded yet.  My husband order a soup and sandwich and I ordered the Jewish sliders.  Long story short .... every table around us received their food even though they arrived after us!  It took so long that the couple next to us commented on how long our food was taking (at this point they were almost done with their meal).  Not being able to locate our server, I went up to the hostess and asked if someone could find out where our food was.  In less than a minute the manager (Phil) magically plots the food on the table and says, \"the sliders just take a really long time\".  No apology, nothing.  Without  going into the a lengthy description of the dialogue that followed between my husband and Phil, suffice it to say that Phil had real attitude for manager.  At no time did he offer an apology, free dessert or to take anything off the bill.  He practically blamed us for being too impatient!

To make matters worse, right after Phil left the table, our server, Justin, decide to continue with the attitude.  He asked us how everything was and my husband replied that, \"he didn't know yet because we just got our food.\"  Justin didn't seem to understand why my husband was so upset, and my husband explain about the wait for the food.  Justin's reply ..... \"Well, you have your food now ... what's the problem?\"

I left out lot's of detail, but you get the picture.... they could give a crap about service.  I don't care how good the food is, but rude service with attitude, especially from management is never acceptable.  We will not be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Huevos Rancheros I've ever had. Unfortunately, the great food experience was diminished by the huge cockroach walking on my table. I won't be back."}
{"text":"If you like portions and deli-style food, Chompie's is the place for you. Their Potato sliders are the best."}
{"text":"They have really good baked potato soup, and also really good scrambled eggs and waffle with strawberries and whipped cream.

if you are Polish and see that they have pierogi on the menu, don't get your hopes up--this is a Jewish Deli and the pierogis are overdone and dry and don't taste at all like you would expect.   Same if you are Mexican and get the Albondigas soup. Not dry, but definitely an odd flavor.

They do have some sort of a \"boot camp\" breakfast menu. I haven't tried anything on there at all.   The lemon bars were good the first time we went, but not the 2nd; I was told it's hit or miss with the taste of those.

It's a cute restaurant chain in AZ with 4, I think, locations, and a NY Deli-type theme. There is graffiti, license plates from NY, sports pix, etc all over the walls as decoration.

Mostly we haven't gotten good service here. It's been a pleasant surprise when we have.  And if you go on a Sunday around noonish, they don't take reservations or call-ahead seating and it's normally a 25 to 40 min wait.  And if you have kids? The waitresses mostly forget to bring the cookie they get as part of their meal at the end. I didn't know about it and was surprised, and asked what was that for? She said, it's part of the kids' meal. 

oh, and if you go to the Tempe location? the manager not only doesn't care, but he can't read the handwriting of the ppl taking your name down, calls the wrong name, passes you up, and then when you ask why it's been longer than they said and ppl who came in after you are getting seated, he gives you an attitide and said he called your name repeatedly. We were sitting right there--we went nowhere, including to their bathroom, while we waited.  Not sure if he whispered my name into someone else's ear, but I'm not deaf. I heard everyone else's name being called, including \"Jake\" when there was no Jake. I'm pretty sure I was Jake that day, but they denied it and said there was definitely a Jake. Funny I saw no one answering them when they repeatedly called Jake and moved on to the next person on the list.  And it's really a tight squeeze in the Tempe location; the tables/booths seem a bit too close together, especially if you have a baby and need to use a high-chair."}
{"text":"Have been here a year already and not experienced this before? What Is wrong with me? Chompies is chomp chomp chomp good. I may be biased because it's for everyone but reminded me of my Jewish heritage. 
Hubby went with the brisket dinner which he marveled over being tender and plentiful with a side potato latkes. I had the Jewish sliders and while good they were a little hard to eat. Full take home capacity allowed me to bring home some chopped liver. Boy have I missed you! 
Don't be discouraged the menu is large and has something for everyone! Next stop breakfast! My new favorite place to go. Don't forget to try the crunchy pickles they bring to the table. See you there!"}
{"text":"I've been disappointed with this place before and that's why I have only been here once.  Today,  my coworkers decided to order from Chompies, so I ordered a Reuben.  One of my coworkers also got a Reuben.  I was totally stoked about having a nice Reuben.  No 1000 Island dressing!!  No sauerkraut!!  Bread was not toasted.  Fries were awful.  What THE heck???  My coworker called and complained.  Dude's name was Mario.  He didn't care.  Last time I went to Chompie's was 10 years ago.  Guaranteed I won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Nom! 

I think that as Jewish delis go, this one is really good. It's not my dead Jewish grandmother's kitchen, so fine, they don't get the fifth star."}
{"text":"1st visit to this AZ deli.  Passed The one in Arrowhead many times but never stopped in.  Service was great and the menu quite large.  Thought I try a bialy wth lox smear. Bialy not true, but the smear very delicious. Definitely would pick some of that up and take home.  Plan on going back, because few other things I want to sample.  Oh and their desserts look good, but I'll see."}
{"text":"I don't go too often because I don't live too close, but when I do go, it is always GOOD food and GREAT sevice. They will fix your order no questions asked if there is an issue. And the deli has the best selection and I love the Challah! Note that the challah is baked daily! Not just on Fridays. It is a little $."}
{"text":"I had called to make a reservation for 20 of us celebrating 4 birthdays which we have done in the past. I was told I could not bring in a birthday cake from a bakery that we had to buy their cake, which we never had to do the times we had been there before. Called Chompies regarding a birthday cake and they told us that they would sell us a cake that would serve 8 for $35.00 therefore to accommodate 20 guests it would cost us $105.00. Makes no sense. When I called to cancel the reservation all I got in reply was Thank you for calling.  They just lost 20 customers."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times for brunch.  The food is always very good and the bagels are amazing."}
{"text":"i took my family there for lunch, and as always, the original Jewish sliders are great.  It only took us about 15 minutes to be seated, and our server was great.  The only thing I would change is the activities they have to keep kids entertained while waiting to eat.  With a 5 year old and a two year old, I can appreciate the value of a menu that they can color on while they are waiting.  The kids menus had great choices, and the chicken fingers my youngest daughter had were phenominal, but keeping them busy while we waited was tough."}
{"text":"I have eaten at chompies at this location and have had great service. So to my surprise when I called to give them an order for CATERING I was placed on hold for 6 minutes because only a manager could tell me if I can get an order for tomorrow ??? Luckily I called the shea location was assisted and only put on hold for 30 seconds to check w catering manager and order submitted. They should takes notes from the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Let me first start of my saying I've been looking forward to eating here since we moved to Glendale in April.
The menu is huge lots of selections of food to get.
So we came to get food this morning. Our waitress I can't remember her name but she was so friendly and great customer service.
Now to the food. Again I feel like I need to stress this I'm from New Jersey I grew up eating at typical Jewish delicatessens and in my own kitchen of matzo ball soup and all the other typical foods... And I'm pretty picky so of course I want to try the matzo ball soup. And usually I compare it to mine or my moms or a delicatessen back home.
Ehh The matzo ball alone was so bland and flavorless. I was soooo disappointed one huge boring tasteless matzo ball. But the soup, noodles, chicken and the veggies in the soup we're good. Just that matzo ball so bland. the bagel chips that come with it were pretty good. 
I also had a pumpernickel bagel with chive cream cheese which was OK. 
My fiancé had the breakfast two eggs bacon hashbrowns. He said everything was fine minus the hashbrowns they weren't cooked enough for his liking.
I'm sure at some point we will come back to try the sandwiches and  other goodies. I really would like to try all the sweets and cookies they have."}
{"text":"Sandwiches to die for. If you're in the mood for a classic New York deli style sandwich where the meat is the star and the sandwich is not slopped with all sorts of sauce, then this is your place. Beware though, you will likely pack on 5 lbs after one meal here. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Chompies? If you raise your hand, you are banished and deserve all the corn dogs and pb&j you can get.

The food at Chompies is always amazing. Some favorites include the lox, the Monte Cristo and the meat knish.  The deli selections are fantastic as well.

My only (not even) complaint is that when we came last time, a huge party came in and hadn't called ahead first. The manager let them (and everyone else) know out loud of his discontent. Then they were seated before us! 

Every so often, you get a young server who should find another vocation, but we, for the most part, always have great service. Once we were in late, and we're gifted the end of the day bagels! Oh happy day!

Chompies is so much more than a Jewish Deli. It is a place for food, memories, family and friends."}
{"text":"First time eating here , the menu is huge , about anything and anyway you would want it . I had the pastrami and it was amazing , very fast service and place is very clean , I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Chompies! I never knew they were a NY style place. I would have come much sooner!!! Portions were huge. Husband had pastrami-he says it was awesome. I had breakfast with the corned beef hash. Very good. Bakery a little pricey....but already thinking about when I can get here again!!"}
{"text":"Came here totally for a specific loaf of bread. Walked out with a different( better) bread and pastries. Ima big fan of cheese danishes. Theirs was muy deliciouso. It's was perfect in the sense of not too much of the cheese. Perfect blend.  

Chicken soup rocks with the bagels. Fifth star is for the multiple visits and nothing has been off. They have multiple locations and that's when, usually , the quality drops."}
{"text":"There is no denying that Chompie's food rocks, but I had the most amazing customer service today! I snuck in for a little lunch by myself and Tanya was so polite and attentive! She knows the menu extremely well and made the perfect number of stops at my table. She even offered me a drink to go without me having to ask. I know this used to be the norm back in the day when kids cared about their jobs, but it's rare to find anymore. Tanya is extremely awesome and an amazing server- I wish there were more of her out there! I'll be back for sure and will ask for her section every time!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent the 32nd Street & Greenway location, so I'm shocked to see they moved.........closer to where I used to live but AFTER I left !!  Anyway, I loved this deli.  They catered many a Rosh Hashanah / Yom Kippur meal for us.  I LOVED their bakery, esp. their babka and rugelah.  They made a mean sweet noodle kugel, and we used to order challah from them many a Shabbat.  Their bagels were legendary, and I loved when the Phoenix Suns would do really well and make it into the playoffs......the bagels were purple and orange.  They had every flavor of bagel imaginable, along with bialys.  I miss their bagels.  My favorite sandwich of theirs was either tuna salad or egg salad.  (My friend used to ask, \"Who gets tuna at a deli?  Make it at home.\"  I still did.......I just loved it.)  I'm quite certain they still serve the same great food and still remain the BEST deli in the Greater Phoenix/Scottsdale area, bar none."}
{"text":"We made a reservation a week in advance for our group. We called at 8:00 this morning with the exact count for our breakfast. When we arrived they said they didn't have our reservation and we're short staffed. We ordered our food and waited and waited. Another group and others came in. Still only 2 waitresses. We were refilling our own drinks from the coffee stand. Finally got our food and 4 of us had cold food. One of our group was still waiting for her food. The waitress offered to have our cold food replaced but said it would take awhile. The lady who was still waiting for food finally got hers and it was luke warm. We were not charged but we also didn't get breakfast. First time there for breakfast and won't go back. Can't say if the food was good or bad"}
{"text":"good food in a great location with original decor.  One of the few places in the Phoenix area that sells American Jewish food."}
{"text":"How is it that I missed this place all these years! Reasonable prices, great service, great food, and excellent bagels! And... MATZO BALL soup I'll be back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Does not compare to it's equivalents in Chicago or NYC, but if you are craving decent deli in the desert, it does the trick. Had a toasted bagel and nova lox with cream cheese, red onion , tomato,greek olives.. side of very good cole slaw and, if you can believe this , a side of excellent potato pancakes served with sour cream and applesauce. My brother opted for a cup of split pea soup (it was so good and I don't even like split pea soup ..he gave me a taste) and 1/2 real turkey (not fabricated) sandwich. We shared an apple strudel for dessert and it was so so. They were handing out chocolate babka samples as we walked out and of course we tasted them. Best babka ever. There was no need to eat anything else for the rest of the day.....(ok, I had a few peanuts at the ball park later that evening.)"}
{"text":"I had fairly low hopes for Chompie's given the far-from NYC location and its Applebee's-like appearance. However, each trip there has been met with success. I don't eat red meat, so my choices are somewhat limited. Nonetheless, my Turkey Reuben and Chicken Liver sandwiches have been excellent. My friend who has gone there with me has indeed ordered red meat sandwiches and has been satisfied as well. The guys even have Dr. Brown's sodas including the infamous Cel-Ray (tastes like Sprite at first then comes the celery flav).

Although the complimentary pickles seem to vary in quality, and the waiters can be slow and sometimes clueless as to the ins and outs of the menu, Chompie's has been a solid addition to my restaurant cycle."}
{"text":"basically pretty good jewish kosher food. all the food i had was really good and service was good as well. I highly recommend coming here for breakfast bc there is a fantastic menu for that there-belgian waffles, pancakes all kinds, fresh bagels, omelets, burritos etc.. homefries are top notch. For dinner here i had a good appetizer, a delicious tuna salad sandwich, and matzball soup. man vs. food went here for the brisket slider sandwich challenge. i didn't realize it was a chain til later, bc it all tastes so fresh! they also have a huge deli with tons of bakery cookies n pastries. make sure you get the food here that you can't get elsewhere-like (dried corned beef, pastrami etc...) the menu is a bit overwhelming so that's what I would recommend doing. I recommend getting their homemade meatloaf as well-amazing gravy comes with it. just be aware the food can be a little bit expensive. their bagels and Jewish breads (challah) are good too."}
{"text":"First time at Chompies, fantastic.   I ordered their cheeseburger with everything on it, delicious flavor. 
Menu is quite large so that means I have to make many trips there because everything I saw coming out to adjacent tables looked and smelled awesomely. I have to trip Chompies again.  Server was friendly and knowledgeable.  Took care of us, great service.  His name was Terek if I pronounced it correctly."}
{"text":"I went a few months ago. I haven't had the chance to review it. I thought it was great! We had large portions and I wasn't able to eat it all! The only downside was the customer service. It wasn't great, but the food was good."}
{"text":"It's really hard to find a good Jewish Deli in Phoenix, but Chompies fills that void.  My husband loves the Pastrami and gets it every time.  Everything I have ordered has been very good.  Their bakery makes the cutest cakes too!"}
{"text":"Without inserting a single cutesy Yiddish-ism, I will say that Chompie's is predictably mediocre and makes up for quality with quantity. The food is good, OK, reasonably satisfying, but not amazing and crave-worthy. The portions are absurd. 

The little bakery delights in the case are surprisingly expensive, and usually end up looking better than they taste. Again, they're not overtly horrible, but not great. Totally meh. The exception is the little chocolate-dipped butter cookies. I can easily eat pounds and pounds of them. They are light and melt-in-your-mouth yummy. 

I usually wouldn't even bother to write a meh review, because really, who cares? But today, when we went for breakfast, I had a go cup of Circle K coffee with me, the hostess told me I wasn't allowed to have it for \"health department reasons\". How stupid do I look, exactly? She said she could \"hold\" it for me up front until we were done eating or she could toss it. I told her the coffee would simply sit on the floor under the booth where she wouldn't see it. Is she high? That's the stupidest thing I ever heard. The server was at least slightly embarrassed and offered to get me a Chompie's mug to pour the coffee into. In retrospect, I should have done that because the house coffee was awful. How jacked up is that?!"}
{"text":"We went to Chompie's for the first time in mid June and thought it was very good.  It is a traditional New York style deli and has all of the traditional deli food options.  I had a hot dog and it was great.  They also have potato pancakes, crisp and served with applesauce and sour cream.  The reuben and turkey reuben were also very good.  They also have a gigantic dessert case, which looked fantastic although we did not partake."}
{"text":"Great bakery but pastrami sandwitch falls short big time!!! Its just not the real thing!!"}
{"text":"josh's whole grain french toast
cabo skillet
very good restaurant. i'd go back the next time i'm in town."}
{"text":"I want to love Chompie's, but every time I venture in it's simply an average experience.

Average in breakfast quality and price, Chompie's is a great place to go if you're looking for brunch on the weekends. Expect a wait when you get there!

While the atmosphere is comfortable and the service was average, there's not a lot that makes Chompie's super special. The eggs benedict I ordered was good but not extraordinary. The portion sizes and prices were equivalent. The service was complimentary but expected at such an established joint.

Experience Chompie's at least once but don't pull in thinking you'll have the best breakfast of your life. Comfortable, easy, and average."}
{"text":"The food here is good basic Jewish deli food.  I especially love their bagels but, had to walk out tonight as five people behind the counter couldn't get to me in over 15 minutes.  I was second in line.  They were NOT busy at 8pm.  The people in line with me were not happy either.  Ill be back tomorrow for some more bagels.  Maybe I will have a better experience."}
{"text":"this review is for the tempe location. yes, the line is usually long but it's worth it in my opinion. the matzo ball soup is wonderful- it reminds me of the homemade stuff i'm used to! the corned beef is always good and surprisingly, so is the grilled cheese! thier black and whites and hametashen are awesome. the service is always a+ but still acceptable. please read my review of their chandler location- i'll take the service in tempe over that any day!"}
{"text":"disclaimer: this review and the two stars are for the chandler location ONLY! i will post a review of the tempe location along with the extra star it deserves. i grew up around authentic kosher delis and was in love with chompie''s the first time i went to the tempe location. we went past the one in chandler and decided to give it a try. the restaurant was not busy yet it took quite a while for our sever, who seemed to hate her job, to even come get our drink orders. our drinks came and then it was another 15 minutes until we got our 1/2 sandwich and soup. our waitress then disappeared. the corned beef was lukewam and a little fattier than i'm used to. the matzo ball soup was good-no bagel chips, however. the service shocked me- i'm tempted to give this a one star review since our waitress, amy, was so rude and horrible. i will still be a chompie's fan but plan to avoid the chandler location at all costs!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here. This time we waited about 20 min for two people . Which I don't mind the wait, but when you look at the empty tables that need to be cleaned makes the wait a little intolerable. Counted at least 10 tables. The pickles that the waitress brought were more cucumber tasting then pickle. Not my favorite.
The food was good, even with the 25 minute wait. I got the pastrami sandwich. I did not feel cheat on the meat. The wife got a tuna melt. Her only complaint was that it wasn't salty. The food is not cheap. I don't have a problem with the price just the service. 
The only reason I'm giving three stars is the food was good and I feel the waitress did her job. She even recognized I was a veteran from my debate card and they offer a 20% discount.  Which is nice.  Chompies management is doing her and her fellow servers a injustice."}
{"text":"Restaurant food was OK.  Split pea was very good.  Pastrami was quite good!  Chop liver was tangy and weird tasting.  I wouldn't order again.  Derma was fine but not fresh.  Roast Beef didn't have much taste and nothing was added to it.  Chicken and matzoh ball soup was quite good.  Most of the servers looked depressed which was a downer.  Their service was good, however."}
{"text":"Ist visit.  Huge portions.  Great burger and fries.  Service was almost adequate.  Would recommend.  Thank you for keeping my credit safe after I left it there!"}
{"text":"This place is a short walk from work and thought to order breakfast here by take out. My first time eating at Chompies. I order the two eggs any style breakfast along with turkey sausage. Well, let's just say that was $12 bucks wasted. Buyers remorse for certain. Hash browns were not cooked. Had only a slight crisp around the edge and tasted a bit raw. Super greasy too. I ordered scrambled eggs and there was still some runny eggs on the top. This is gross. The toast was decent but chewy. Who wants chewy bread? Seriously. Then the last bit...the turkey sausage. Well, they sat on the eggs and had runny eggs underneath. After swiping this excess off, the sausage was okay. Nothing to waste a couple extra dollars on. In fact, I recommend leaving them off the order. I offered to share and no one wanted any or willing to cook this in the microwave. This was my first experience eating here and will also be my last. Just wish I made a better decision to spend $12."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5

The wait time for 2 was 20-25 minutes. My sister and I got seated and were provided a menu. The menu had a variety to choose from which was awesome. They had a little bit of everything for all types of customers. I thought it was cool that they had a bakery and a bagel shop combined inside the restaurant. I ordered he Fiesta Omelette which came with beans, beef chorizo, avocado, onions, tortilla chips, cheese, and home fries and a bagel of your choosing. I thought that the food was okay. It was definitely good portion size for what you paid for. The chorizo was overbearing to the rest of the food. The cheese was put on top of the Omelette which was fine but it literally covered the entire Omelette which made it seem like I ate more cheese than I did egg. The home fries were amazing and the blueberry bagel I got was toasted to perfection. The reason I'm giving it a 3.5 was due to the service. The waitress that attended our table kind of forgot about us and didn't really check in to provide us napkins or refills. Man vs food has also visited this place which means you should definitely come and check it out."}
{"text":"They are one of the few places that serve a Monte Cristo.  They are wonderful and I have moved out the of Phoenix area but when ever I go back for a visit they are a must hit."}
{"text":"I absolutely love going here! We always go in the morning for breakfast and the staff is always so friendly and welcoming. They are usually pretty quick with getting you seated and getting your food out to you (depending on how busy it is). Location is great and super convenient! Don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of having Jason as our server on the 2nd evening of the Passover services. He was an absolute delight. Not only did he keep all the glasses full and make sure a table of 5 was completely taken care of, but he also was great with numerous special request (such as various to go containers, different sized condiment container lids, and making sure all add ons like gravy and sour cream were in abundance). I have come to he Passover and Rosh Hashanah dinners numerous times. This was the first I've brought my parents and they were beyond thrilled with the service and commented as such to the manager at the time as well. Great job. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Chompies atmosphere was a delight. Just the New York vibe I needed. The Biltmore Benedict was pretty tasty. Tomatoes onions and smoked salmon made for a flavor filled bene. All though I'm not a fan of smoked salmon (menu did not state the salmon was smoked) the over all flavor was decent. Also, there could have been less hollandaise sauce. I would like to touch on the three options of sides. Home fries, side of fruit or potato pancake. The side of fruit was a high disappointment. A side of fruit is as expected, small bowl or cup. However the fruit (pineapple, melon, and cantaloupe) was served in a small ramekin."}
{"text":"The service and even the customers are very nice! I dined with my kids, 1 and 5 and our server Joshua was very accommodating. Kids loved the chocolate chip pancakes."}
{"text":"Every time we come here, I like this place less and less... Speaking on today's experience, we waited for my Bloody Mary a lot longer than usual, the extra side of syrup was almost forgotten about, my home fries came out as mashed potatoes, and my Eggs Benedict didn't come on an english muffin like it traditionally does (nor was I asked what I wanted it to come with). I'm not sure how much longer we'll be trying to give this place a chance."}
{"text":"I didn't know i have a Kosher place that close to my house... they make the best Kosher Challah in the world. Very nice and clean place. Rich and lots of variety... as a picky person when it comes to food, i was able to find a lot of stuff for me to eat there. Great service too."}
{"text":"Oh Chompies!!  Almost like having Grandma Esther back with us.  The food is  consistent, authentic and delicious.  We eat breakfast there as well as dinner on a regular basis. They have great gluten free items, clearly marked if that's relevant to you.  The portions are generous and wait staff is good.   Oh and check out the bakery.  It's beautifully displayed with an incredible selection."}
{"text":"My mom and I had a terrible experience here today. To start we sat down and didn't have a bowl of creamer for our coffee (no big deal), so we grabbed the one from the table next to us.  The bowl of individually wrapped coffee creamers was COVERED in ants. We told the waitress and handed her the bowl and told her that the table probably needed to be wiped down. She said ok and didn't even look at the table. We told her again thinking she was just busy but she still didn't even look at the table. Then they sat people
At a table infested with ants without even a wipe down. Blah. Next we ordered the Chompies Benedict and it was disgusting. It really looked like they slapped an egg on a bagel with a chewy piece of ham and poured cheese-wiz all over it... It was dis-gust-ing.  To make it even worse, the coffee tasted like cigarettes. We left having taken three bites out of our meal and the waitress didn't think twice. We paid the bill and went and ate breakfast somewhere else. It was a sad morning. I would NOT recommend going to this Chompies. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to splurge on lunch today so we stopped in at chompies. The service was horrible. The food was good however, but a $40.00 lunch should include a little more than order taking and delivering."}
{"text":"Worst pastrami ever. I just threw away a Chompie's hot pastrami sandwich because it was inedible. I had three bites and it made me sick to my stomach. If I'd not done take out, I would've sent it back. 
It came on limply toasted pumpernickel without either mustard or mayo. The pastrami (if it was, it tasted unlike any pastrami I've ever had), was fatty, gristly, greasy and tasteless. Big rinds of fat layered on the sandwich, so much so that it was more of a fat sandwich than meat. There were no peppercorns and no seasoning in the meat. Just fatty. Where I come from, pastrami is bold and flavorful. This was disgusting. I hope that my experience is unique, because I'd heard great things about Chompie's and I'm still feeling sick to my stomach. 
The photo is of the slices of meaty fat that comprised my sandwich."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service.  They don't have a \"To Go\" window.  If you order over the phone they expect you to wait in line with everyone else that's there purchasing from the deli so your wait is 15-20 minutes defeating the purpose of take out and quick service.  The food is good but not worth the slow service in the restaurant or ridiculous take out process."}
{"text":"Man this place is bad.  Extremely expensive for subpar food.   The pastrami and corned beef are no better than you could purchase at Fry's or Safeway's delis.  We had a piece of carrot cake for dessert.  Dry and flavorless.  When we walked in there was a woman sitting on a bench by the hostess stand she was wearing a badge that said \"supervisor.\"    All the while our service was extremely slow.  Took forever to get our meal yet she is sitting around not helping her staff.  I cannot recommend a visit to this establishment."}
{"text":"Not worth the wait.Food is over priced.Been here 2 times and wont be back.First time got a pastrami sandwich,tough and fatty.Second time I tried breakfast.Got an egg sandwich.The hash browns were swimming in grease! How can you screw hash browns up?Everything on my plate was greasy,even the bagel.Really don't know how they stay in business.Wait staff was slow both times.had to wait over 10 minutes for our drink order.30 minutes for food to arrive"}
{"text":"This review is for their breakfast.  The menu is just way too large, as it took me twice as long to choose something.  But you can't say they don't have variety - you name it, they got it!  I had the apple pancakes and they didn't disappoint!  Portions are large.  Service is very good.  

Apparently Ike Davis frequents this place, so if you're a Mets fan, that's a plus.  NY style deli?  I didn't see any taylor ham/pork loin on the menu!"}
{"text":"It was crazy the last time I was here.  They were doing some kind of slider fest special due to a tv show they were featured on.  $1 sliders brings out all the lookie lou's.  The deserts still rock and the red velvet cake I have dreams about.  The service can be sketchy but the food has always been good."}
{"text":"Potatoes were really salty bagel was OK not great. Kids meals are kind of pricey for not including much $4.99 for 1 pancake & 1 slice of bacon.
Not impressed will not be going back."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with family, and my good friend. My food was okay, enjoyed the pickles. My friend ordered a turkey burger with some pastrami on the side. They just forgot about the pastrami, and the Patty was a hockey puck. Pretty unfortunhe ate considering this was one of the first places we ate at since moving down here. Waitress was somewhat inattentive, asked her for sauces with our food and to adjust the thermostat (it was freezing) and she appeared annoyed. She was annoyed yet again when my friend asked for the pastrami that he ordered....

To top it all off she told him the wrong price on the pastrami, so he was in for a surprise when the bill came."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here for our Sunday breakfast its always busy, but thats ok because it just shows that its good food that many people enjoy! I ordered there classic french toast for the second time and its perfect serving size, and its grilled to perfection. There coffee is good and reminds me like Im in NY! I'll definitely come here again and recommend it to all my friends and family!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast at the Chompie's at the Mercado Del Rancho Center and it pains me to write that this breakfast stands out as the worst breakfast I have ever had, ever. If you think about it, you really have to go out of your way to screw up breakfast but they managed.

We knew we were off to a bad start when we stood at the entrance for about 5 minutes (Please Wait to be Seated) for someone to seat us in a 1/2 empty dining room. The waiter was attentive so no problems there. The problems started when the food arrived. 3 of us had menu variations of corn-beef hash and poached eggs. The corn-beef had the look and texture of road kill and the eggs were hard boiled. 2 of us requested that the eggs be re-done but only one of us received it after assurances from the wait staff that it was \"on its way...\". The food was also more or less room temp when it arrived.

To be fair, there are a lot of Chompie's and maybe this was a bad day at a singe location. The menu is extensive and I did see other customers orders that looked more appetizing. It would appear that they have good food but the execution was the problem. We might try it again and order something different."}
{"text":"monster sized sandwiches, delicious baked goods. I love their potato pancakes.. Yes, I'm a fan.

I wouldn't recommend their motzah ball soup though ... It's watered down with little body.. A far cry from what I get at home.

This place can get very busy, especially during the cooler months."}
{"text":"I give 3 stars for the food and 2 stars for the service. This is more like Jewish soul food restaurant where people bring their families for lunch or dinner or just simply meet friends for lunch and play mahjong in the back room. 

Our waitress was kind of in hurry or rushing when she took our order (maybe she didn't write it right or she didn't listen what we ordered), in result we didn't get the food what we wanted.

I ordered chicken & matzo ball soup with halla bread and came out in chicken noodle soup with think crispy bagel. I was like where is my matzo ball soup and my halla bread, ha..,ha....now I have chicken noodle soup with matzo ball in it which was good for hungry belly. The halla bread was good as well.

My mother in law had stuffed cabbage, but I think it was too sweet for my taste. My husband ordered tongue sandwich with coleslaw and again came out with French fries instead, ha....ha.....,

It was nice that with yelp check in, we got 1 free black and white cookie, it was ok flavor but hey it's free. Thank you chompie!"}
{"text":"There's a lot to be said about Chompies! Its great that they have several locations throughout the valley! Everyone a little different from the next but I love this location because of its shear size. I first tried Chompies 8 years ago before I even moved to Arizona and it was good for a small family lunch out on the way up to Fountain Hills.
Their bagels and cream cheese are very good. Not the best in the area, but close enough.
The Chicago dog, which is what I had today was pretty good. Again not the best in the area but a decent price with fries. I love their fries. Always very warm, never hot or cold. Nice and thick with the skin still on them! There is plenty of space but unfortunately you don't always get lucky enough to get a good server.
The delicatessens are good. Haven't had much Jewish desserts but their cookies that they give free with a kids meal are soft and yummy. There is a very large variety, so be prepared to be a bit overwhelmed!!"}
{"text":"Once again I placed a telephone order for pick up. Person taking order didn't know menu items. Then when I arrived in 20 minutes...order never put in. After an additional 15 minutes they overcharged and had to refund for overcharge. Thinking this will be my last trip to chompies."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time and this place is amazing.  Very unique compared to the other places I've been too."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location and it was really cool.  The food and service were great and the bakery was huge compared to other locations."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed my first visit to Chompies.  We will definitely be back.  We tried the original slider, the classic rueben, clam chowder, and some pastries.  The corned beef was fantastic, though I would appreciate more kraut on my rueben, & the russian dressing wasn't as flavorful as I would hope.  
The slider was very good...a good balance of sweet (from the roll) and savory.  The brisket was tender and flavorful, & the potato pancake was quite crispy.  The dipping gravy was perfect to soak into all the starch of the sandwich."}
{"text":"Good prices,  good food, lots of good, great desserts, fantastic service, featured on TV for their Sliders!  Don't keep driving, stop in!"}
{"text":"Always an enjoyable experience at Chompie's.  Hugh menu.  Good food and service.  Delish deserts."}
{"text":"I don't eat breakfast. Yet here, I demolished it and then some.

Whoa, Bloody Marys to die for plus the option of non-pork meat to go with eggs and whatever else ordered will always have a fond spot in my heart. Very very crowded weekend mornings, so try to get in there as early as you can before or after the rush. But I probably would have waited if I had too because it was just so good. 

I had been to this location once before but during lunch/dinner hours. I must say, that visit didn't leave must of an impression on me. I don't even remember what I ate. But this past morning visit concluded a very epic weekend and will probably go down in the history books. Thanks to Clayton (our waiter) and kitchen staff that made my food, beverage, and experience so awesome."}
{"text":"We waited for ever at our table. Bathrooms were out of service. Waited even longer to get the food. Must have been the cooks night off. Food was awful. Even the kids complained. The pickles were still great. Daughter cleaned them out again. Really disappointed this night. Will stick to the one down in Tempe."}
{"text":"The granny girl country skillet is what weekend breakfast dreams are made of. You know when you start to stir around 10:30 am and realize that you are... absolutely ... starving? Chompie's is that perfect 11 am brunch place. 

The have a ridiculously thick menu - but I always order the granny skillet. I  have been going to this place since the day I moved to Phoenix (my stepdad took me there first day move into the dorms..aw) and now I feel I have graduated to the \"adult\" location at Shea Blvd. and 92nd Street. I don't know if I am shrinking, but the portion sizes at this restaurant are becoming astronimical! Everytime I have friends in town we hit up this place - and it seems to leave everyone satisfied, despite their craving. See example:

I wanted breakfast - so I got the skillet (egg beaters scrambled, with country potatoes, turkey bacon, onion, etc. covered in gravy...mmm)

My cousin wanted hot wings - which were actually delicious

My bud Gilbert got a tasty double bacon cheee

Ashley got a breakfast burro...

As you can see, wide array of selections on the menu. If you are so hungover that you can't take off your sunglasses or even begin to try to put a comb through your hair, then the Tempe location is for you. I have found that the Scottsdale location has an average age of about 45, and it looks like they have all gone on a really nice morning bike ride or hike on Camelback and stopped by Chompies on the way to their afternoon pilates."}
{"text":"I agree with Julie W.'s review.  I just don't get all the hype about this place either.  It is definitely just...bleh.  

The menu is too large.  When a place has such a huge, diverse menu they usually don't specialize in anything and everything is just mediocre.  That's what I found with this place.  We went for lunch and it was Packed!  Service was slow which could be from the vast menu choices.  Too many different types of food for the kitchen to keep up with.     

I found the restaurant to be dirty and smelled slightly off.  Couldn't really quite place the smell, but wasn't all that inviting.  I had a Cobb salad and while a huge salad, the lettuce was warm and included quite a few brown pieces.  The little tray of pickles that they put on our table were thrown down and I couldn't help but get the feeling that they had been recycled from someone else's table who didn't eat them.  Not sure why, but I definitely didn't touch them, and I love pickles.

Granted, I've only been once, but the experience was enough to put me off and I haven't wanted to try it again.  There are just too many other good options out there.  But I'm sure I will try it at again and I will update if I have a better experience."}
{"text":"Not a bad place,.i suppose. I had the turkey and dressing and it was quite tasty, but I didn't like the presentation. The spinach was a bit under cooked for my liking."}
{"text":"Good bagels and pastries, however if you dine-in expect the service to take a long time. They definitely need some improvement but it's a nice community atmosphere."}
{"text":"Breakfast all day??? Yay!    I'm a regular here.  Love the homefries and bacon, always above average.

As for sandwiches, yes they are pricey but it usually takes me 3 meals to finish one.  The Grilled Grandpa Rubys (with pastrami and extra grilled sauerkraut) is my favorite.  Mmmmmm, I'm hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast! Early mornings before I fly out if town, I can count on friendly and fast service (thank you Tammy) The food is delicious and always consistent."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times recently. Food was average to good. The service was a little slow and drink refills and orders didn't come until asked. I'm on the fence about going back for the cost."}
{"text":"Went back to Chompies again.  I have to say that they are the most wildly inconsistent place to eat in the area.  They make some of the most delicious food, and I will always run back to get it with the hope that it will be as good as it was 20 years ago...  They are ridiculously over priced, and if that isn't enough, they charge for beverage refills even though no one else in town does.   It isn't saying much, because this isn't a town with many bagelrys, but no one in town matches their bagels.  I'm pretty sure that if even one shop from NYC, Chicago or St. Louis decided to open a place in Phoenix, they would give Chompies a run for their money.  The table service is frighteningly bad.  I took a friend there for lunch well after the rush.  We were waiting and waiting, and waiting.  I stopped in for bagels.  They were out of almost every kind.  I settled for pumpernickel and egg bagels.   I just don't know what else to say.  I'm a little unhappy with myself for going there again when I should know better, I just keep hoping.  Maybe it's because none of the real \"Chompies Family \" are there anymore.  They should come back and see what has happened to their customer service."}
{"text":"You know what they say first impressions are everything.  Hostess does not know what they are doing.  In my world you should be fully trained in order to be out on the floor to deal with customers.  I don't mind waiting for a long period of time if I was told in advance  .  But if you are told less than 25 min waiting, then an hour later other parties just walking in are being seated before me then now I am angry . Finally I get seated in a booth that could fit a party of 4 they stuck a chair to fit the fifth person.  I asked the hostess if I can sit in the booth that was bigger and she responded oh we already have a party there.  I was like really I didn't know you can reserve tables on the fly.  Then she was like ok you can sit there. All the manager can say is sorry and a bunch of excuses why all of them couldn't do their job right.Then they mess up on my food. Oh what could go wrong !  Now I am the only one waiting on my food watching every one else eat.  If this staff is still there Chompies at Arrowhead will be out of business really soon, just like miracle mile deli that was there previously."}
{"text":"Cute place, decent food, convenient area close to the hospital."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would.  Horrible service today!  So bad, we had to walk out.  Terrible from the moment we walked in.  Was Not busy, yet hostess said would be a 15 minute wait, even though several tables were open.  Was told that we came during \"their\" staff break time.  Have never heard such an idiotic thing in my life.  Close your damn doors and shut down if you can't handle customers at 2:30 in the afternoon.  Asked for a booth for my family of 4 and told none available.  There was one right behind us that was clean and available.  Asked for the empty booth behind us and the hostess said that they don't have a server available for that table, due to current employee breaks.  Totally serious...it was not 5 minutes later that this idiot hostess sat a couple of 2 at this same booth that we (family of 4) could not have.  Finally, someone came to get our drink order and right away told us she is not our server but would get our drinnks.  Eventually we meet our server and first thing out of her mouth was \"ready to order?\".  We told of our booth incident.  She said sorry but tables are on a rotation basis.  What the hell this means, don't know or care.  She offers a booth for us, which we take and she walks off with an attitude.  We sit for close to another 10 minutes with no service.  Apparently, this booth is not her table so now we are back to waiting AGAIN.  We walk out obviously irritated over our terrible experience with Chompies and not one employee says anything to us.  We will never be back."}
{"text":"I originally ate at the original Tempe location and was only recently informed that they had other locations.  So I had to go and enjoy my favorite food here.  I normally get their Holland Tunnel, but since I had a friend join me, we decided to try their Perogis.  They were ok, a little too greasy/buttery (not sure) for my taste.  But the dough & filling were tasty and cooked ok.  Unfortunately, the service was not the best, considering they were empty...and with that in mind, it just seemed like the sandwiches were a bit soggy when we got them; which tells me they must have sat for a bit before we got them.  Needles, to say, while I will still eat (normally their food & service is much better) at Chompies, it just won't be at this location."}
{"text":"Came here a while ago for the first time and decided to try their breakfast.  Looked around and it seemed very busy and full of people so we assumed the food would taste great. To be honest, it was disappointing at best. The service was also sub-par and overall, it felt similar to a typical, sticky experience at an Ihop or Dennys. Maybe if we visit again, we'll have a better experience..."}
{"text":"Came in for first time this morning before work. Actually rather giddy to try new chain, deli joint.

My hopes and spirit of ordering a nice LOX on bagel were crushed, however, when I literally stood at \"Order Here\" area for 5 or 7 minutes. I witnessed 4 staff members behind the bar (by deli case at far end) monkeying around. I totally understand if there's a deli crisis down there, but jeez - make eye contact w/me, tell me \"one minute\", or even \"get lost\" - something! Throw me a bone, Chompie's!

The guy behind me gave up and left. I hung in there for a few more minutes. Finally, I gave up as well, as it truly boiled down to: Erin being late for work w/a Lox Bagel and some unnecessary guilt, OR Erin being on time for work (something I do pride myself on...) sans any Lox or bagel w/a clean conscience. I chose the latter, obvi.

I may return or I may not. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Outstanding in every way. Great service even during the lunch rush. Baja burger was HUGE."}
{"text":"Delicious matzo ball soup. And the corn beef sandwich is huge and delicious. The blueberry bagels, pickles, salmon........ Actually everything is good at Chompie's. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Bad food, and even worse service . An hour and a half from start to finish . Saw the waiter 3 X total? Wrong food brought out to my bf, ( he ordered a salad) mom ordered potato pancakes that were burned and rubbery, my order of turkey sliders was ok - not hot , and my fries were missing . $53 for 3 lunches and 3 soda? Not for this my friends ."}
{"text":"Usually come twice a month. The last two times I came for breakfast, including this morning, my food was cold. I would have just asked for it to be warmed up, no harm no foul except our waitress didn't come back for 20 minutes. At that point I had already succumbed to my fate and eaten half. Both bad experiences, were with this same waitress and while her lack of service may be her and her employers fault, the cold food was all the kitchen. I have always liked this place but come on guys, do better. You have one job."}
{"text":"My go to spot for pastrami and corned beef sandwiches with a Dr. Brown Cel-ray of course."}
{"text":"I flew out of Atlanta at 7:45 AM EST, and landed in Phoenix Sky Harbor at 10:45 MST.  At around 2:30 PM, I was sitting in Phoenix Municipal Stadium watching Fall League baseball, and I realized that the last food I ate were airplane peanuts.  In right field was an advertisement for Chompie's, and after acknowledging the hunger, it became all-consuming.  I grew cranky, and my head began to throb.  I was pleased when the game ended in seven innings due to a lack of pitchers or something, instead of disappointed at being denied a full game after coming from so far, but I was got-damn hungry, so I was out the gate and in my rental bee-lining to Chompie's.

The location is extremely easy to get to on the predictable grid-like roadways of Phoenix, and there's plenty of free parking, which starts this visit on the right foot.  The interior is relatively clean, open, and welcoming to small groups or possibly families, with a good amount of seating available.  There was no wait for me on a Friday afternoon, between lunch and dinner.

As much as I enjoy Man v. Food, and challenging everything that Adam Richman does, my track record isn't that great.  That being said, I was tempted to undertake the infamous slider challenge, but the truth is that I've never had the sliders before, so I didn't even know if I would like them, let alone be capable of eating five pounds of them.  So just a regular order of sliders was all I ordered.

When they arrived, I was in awe.  These were no dinky Krystal/White Castle sliders that I associate with the food description slider.  They were larger, fresher, and oh so beautiful.  Before even taking the first bite, my expectations shot through the roof.

And my beautiful god, did they not disappoint.  I swear I was on the cusp of tears after the first bite.  I know I was starving when I ate, but they were just genuinely fantastic.  I want to put a potato pancake on everything I eat from now on, because a combination of the tender meat and slightly crisp along the edges potato pancake made everything make sense.  The gravy only made things better.

Words really can't express just how good these things were.  When I tried, some inappropriate words came out of my mouth.  Despite the fact that it was my first meal on my trip, and I was visiting for just a few days, I knew a second trip was in order.  After the three sliders, I was pretty content, so I don't think I would've been able to finish off a challenge.

But I'll just swear by them regardless, and declare that the next time I'm out in Arizona, Chompie's is mandatory."}
{"text":"Chompies is really the only taste of New York deli here in Arizona. The place can be loud, busy and seem scattered at times. Being from NYC it does not bother me, more comforting actually. They've been around for a very long time in AZ and I've been friends with the family for many, many years. They're absolutely great souls! If you're reading this and have read my other reviews you'd know that I typically don't like to write about the staff, I enjoy writing about the food, and think any staff member can have a bad day, ..... Sooooo not a reason to complain. I do like to compliment when something goes well though. The place was packed, the staff was busy and the wait was long,I'm good with all of that, and in the midst of all this \"organized chaos\" was the most polite and sweetest hostess. My Wife was pointing out how big her smile was. Just kind of made our wait that much better. On the way out we asked for her name, I believe it was Fay...? Hopefully that's correct! Anyway, the family would be pleased with her BIG TIME! As for the food.....well, delicious as always. The Pancakes were awesome the LEO too!"}
{"text":"Jew food heaven!!  I'm part of the tribe so I can say those things.  The Reuben is awesome.  Bagels are good.  Chicken soup is good.  Service is always good, but that's because the family knows all of the servers like family.  Always nice, never a bad meal, nothing is ever a problem, bill is always correct.  Never wait long... Yet something keeps it from getting the elusive 5th star."}
{"text":"Really disappointed, just visiting in town and figured that this would be a good place to grab breakfast.

Walking in was like walking into chaos; stuff everywhere for the holiday and not really a line of customers but a \"crowd\".

Once figuring out where to place my order I walked up to the counter to wait for service listening to the staff talk about another job opportunity at a local hotel.    Once asked for what I wanted it took three people to get my order in the computer.

After waiting 5-10 minutes for my bagels I was handed a mess of items and had to ask for a bag.   (Two breakfast sandwiches and two bagels).

After getting home come to find out my order was wrong and ice cold, the bagels didn't seem like they had been baked 100% and I was very disappointed, I had asked for them to be toasted and even if they had cooled on my 5 minute car ride the butter wasn't even melted.

Really hard to believe that this is the best bagel in Phoenix for 30 years."}
{"text":"Potato Knish - a scoop of mashed potatoes wrapped in pastry dough. I get a little side of gravy and this hangover remedy is heaven on earth. 
Skip the meat-filled knish... the meat is a mixture of leftover pastrami and corned beef and it's made as one huge pie, then sliced and served to you, which means that the pastry dough doesn't cover the two biggest sides of the filling (and we all know that the dough is where it's at). 
The bloody mary is a little weak, too. But this isn't a bar so why should I even complain?
Also, I've never had a \"rainbow cookie\" and was contemplating trying one today... and there were samples on the counter. I had one sample and it blew my freaking mind. But after all that knish PLUS pierogies, I was a little potatoed up to my ears this morning so I'm gonna go back later today to get a box of those dee-freakin-licious chocolate-covered spongy pieces of heaven."}
{"text":"Potato pancakes, pastrami reuben, and chicken and waffles: Extreme carbohydrate overload. 

The mini potato pancake appetizer (5) is seasoned appropriately and cooked up nice and crispy around the edges, soft and warm on the inside. Applesauce and sour cream, of course. 

Pastrami reuben is piled high, warm and delish, sauerkraut/dressing/swiss. Came with coleslaw (a little bland) and we upgraded to sweet potato fries (again, a little bland, and looked slightly battered...?) 

Chicken and waffles - a belgian waffle made with jalapenos and corn in the batter, then they put chicken strips on top of it, and dump a load of cheddar cheese on top of the whole pile. If you like crunchy, and I do like crunchy, the chicken strips have it - almost to the point of TOO much crunch. Wear-down-your-enamel crunch. The combination of the chicken in its seasoned batter plus cheese plus corn plus spicy jalapenos plus waffle plus syrup on top of it all makes a flavor explosion (and later, a slight headache). It was HUGE too - between two people, half of it was still left on the plate. 

There is also a large, beautiful display case full of every kind of pastry you can think of. We didn't make it there. I think next time I'll start with dessert so I can cram it all in..."}
{"text":"Had a great time here with the family grandparents down to niece. Of course there is a line if you go when you want to...so there is that.

I have experienced a steady decline in their food quality of late. Its been annoying. Especially since there hasn't really been a change in how busy they are. 

Its a kitschy place and it will always have a crowd. I probably wont be part of it any longer but would go there if its a destination for a group."}
{"text":"Called in to place an order today. Very rude guy answered the phone. He was not friendly at all and when I would asked a question he would respond very rudely and sarcastically. Work on your customer service. It doesn't cost a cent to be nice. I hung up and never ordering from here again. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I just love this Restaurant! I've only been a few times and every time I have gone it's been delicious. 

The first time I went I got the Corned Beef Sandwich. This was a great sandwich with loads of flavor, Not to mention it was big enough to take half of it home with me.

The second & third time I went I got The \"Aaron's Choice\"  Sandwich. This one I thought was better than the plain Corned Beef, It not only comes with Corned Beef but pastrami, Swiss cheese, coleslaw, and 1000 island dressing on an onion roll for only $12.99. It's a killer deal.

The Service could be a little better and I'm not a huge fan at how the tables are so close together, However the food is DELICIOUS. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great sandwich!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant that Ive been to in a while! Food and costumer service is awesome! We were checked on multiple times which I loved! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Out doing some shopping w/the Ms, Stopped in for a quick bit to eat & WoW was the place packed! She had never been & I had to see the Hostess for a table, when two seats at the bar opened up. Now my honey doesn't useually like sitting at the bar stools as she has a bad back but we were kind of in a hurry, as is everyone this time of year. I hadn't been in a Chompies since 1980...WoW what a mistake, I forgot how damn quick the service was & how GOOD the food was!!!! My girl even said the bar stools were comfrotable & that this was here new favorit place! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times.  This is the first time that I have reviewed this restaurant.  I ordered the Turkey dinner special available only between 3 pm and 6 pm.  I was not disappointed.  The dinner came with salad, mashed potatoes, two kinds of gravy, cranberry sauce and a huge helping of turkey and stuffing.  It was a very good meal.  In the end, I was able to order a small desert that was included.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  If you are hungry, the portions are large and satisfying."}
{"text":"Chompie's is the closest thing to a \"taste of home\" for me, a native NYer.  This is the only place that has a black and white cookie that resembles in taste and texture an authentic b&w cookie from a NY deli. Even AJ's b&w cookie is a travesty, and I love most everything else in AJ's dessert case. But I digress...

I visit Chompie's about once a month for breakfast or brunch. The bagels and bialys are great. My favorite brunchy thing is the Arizona Benedict - a toasted bialy topped with turkey ham (as a non pork-eater I love places that have turkey options!), avocado, tomato, and perfectly poached eggs. Oh how I love that gooey yolk running all over everything on my plate.

I've always had great service here, and even on Saturday morning with a party of 12, I have never waited more than 15 minutes to be seated. Keep on keepin' on Chompie's."}
{"text":"I went here with my granddaughter's recommendation.  We had lunch and she was right, the menu was so huge with so many things to choose from.  I was amazed at all the pastry and salads in the deli part to choose from and take home.  The breads were also unbelievable.  I will surely go there again and next time take my husband.  He loves  eggs benedict and there are many types to choose from!"}
{"text":"Chompie's is our favorite breakfast spot! Their menu is huge, the portions are huge, and they have a great selection of gluten-free items.  They are the only place that i've found that makes gluten-free bagels, and they are DELICIOUS!  We've always had great service, and it is such a treat coming here.  The Chandler location is our favorite."}
{"text":"DONE!.. Stopped in today to pick up a cake and cookies like I do every month for a customers office. Usually have to wait a while which isn't my complaint. I stood there for 10 mins and im not exagerating...I was the only one at the counter.. two employees noticed me numerous times whike i was waiting...I'm patient so I waited. .a lady walks up and they take care of her right away.. I'm done. I've been buying from Chompies for 20 years and I've finally had enough. Might be a good idea to get more help as I watched two other people get tired of waiting and left also."}
{"text":"Horrible service and value. The waiter was in brain neutral. No hello. No smile. No follow up. Did not take care of requests. No water or soda or pickle refills. Simply acted as though he was doing us a favor. I actually voiced my disappointment as the female manager walked by. She just kept walking. Wow. I won't go back. This place has cratered in service and value."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot, for this post I got free cookies.  
I just noticed they have a bar inside, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Me and my husband were visiting my sister for the long weekend. She goes to ASU and suggested this place for sunday brunch. Place was packed but we didnt wait to get seated. Server was right up for taking the order. But the food took some time get to us. 
Chicken fajita omelette, belgian waffles and some skinny omelette. Everything was good."}
{"text":"Their menu is overwhelming with all of the choices. They jave just about everything a restaurant could offer. You won't leave this place hungry because their portions are huge. You can easily split a meal between two people.

I am a fan of having breakfast or lunch here. I have never had dinner.

Great bagels and bread!"}
{"text":"So as you can tell by the time I am doing the review,  it's 10 to 9 on a Saturday night. We came here, walked in, and there was a restaurant full of people. 
The front lady barely even looked up and a busboy came over and in his whiny little voice said \"it's 10 to 9\" as if to let her know that it was going to be too much of a hassle to seat us because he had somewhere else to be. 

She said we're closing in 10 minutes under her breath and indicated that he would be faster if we did take out. So I asked her do you not want us to eat here and she said no it's okay we can see you, and then she said but take out was faster. So I said don't worry about it we'll leave so you can close.
The end."}
{"text":"Went hear yesterday with my fiancé, service was great and the food was awesome! I got the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries and potato salad. The food was amazing! The sandwich was so good and the potato salad was great as well! Service was really good to, whenever I was out of water the waiter would immediately come up and refill the cup unlike other places who may have you waiting for 10 minutes. I would definitely come again and most likely will on the near future, the only thing that got me a little bit was the price, but hey not that big of a deal because the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Chompies has been one of my favorite places for years, so I was thrilled when they opened one in my neck of the woods on the northwest side of town. I've been to this location a number of times and always had a fantastic experience. As a frequent iced tea drinker I'm always pleased when a place has more than one option for iced tea, and Chompie's wins on that front. The menu has tons of options - there really is something for everyone! I'm a fan of their southwest-inspired dishes, as I'm a fan of spice, but my boyfriend, who hates any hint of heat, also has a number of favorites on their menu. We even brought our out of town friends here to show off our breakfast and brunch options and they loved it! I never have any complaints with the service here, as they're always very friendly and attentive, and are good at timing their check ins at a good time in the meal. The price is always reasonable here, and despite the fact that it's a super popular place and always quite busy, I never have to wait an unreasonable time for a table. All in all, Chompie's is an \"absolutely I will return\" and I continue to recommend to anyone who is looking for some bomb breakfast!"}
{"text":"I prefer the location at the PV mall, as their service and food is much better. I hadn't been to Chompies in years, as I went there once years ago with my mom and we sat at a table in the corner for 30 minutes with no service (no one brought water, nothing) until we finally left. Recently, I visited the PV location and the service was quick, the food was delicious, and I was nothing short of pleased. After an appointment yesterday I wanted to go, and realized we were closer to this location, so we went. The table seated next to us after us received help at least 10 minutes before we were helped, and when we were helped we did not get the customary table pickles. I asked my waitress for iced tea, as I had heard the gentleman at the table next to us order some, and he was given an option of multiple different teas, but my waitress left immediately after I said \"iced tea,\" not giving me the option to choose. Our food came quickly but our orders were wrong (my mom's egg white omelette was not just egg whites) and my omelette with chorizo had very little chorizo in it. The home fries, my favorite part, included ~3 potatoes, and clearly was the bottom of the pan. The waitress never came back to fill our drinks and had to be flagged down for our check once we had grown impatient after being ignored for so long. Next time I will go out of my way to PV instead. As we left, the waitress walked right past us with no \"thank you\" or \"goodbye.\""}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for breakfast and both times, I was happy with what I ordered. The first time I got an omelette and the second time I ordered eggs Benedict. The Benedict had avocado and it was delicious. Everyone at my table ordered something different, we were generally satisfied with both the quality of the food and the service."}
{"text":"I've been here for various meals of the day and I've definitely enjoyed them all.  I wanted corned beef for breakfast but not with hash since I wanted to try their latkes.  It's great to have it by itself instead of being mixed with the hash.  They make great sandwiches as well and they give you plenty so you won't go away hungry.  

Service is great and you won't notice the wait.  I spent more time looking over their expansive menu than waiting for the food.  Can't forget to have a real boiled bagel and you can definitely taste the quality in all that they do!"}
{"text":"Don't overlook this place for lunch. I have had a Ruben and a Jewish slider here and both were very good. Not as impressed with their bagels."}
{"text":"I just tried Chompie's today and had the Aaron's Choice on rye. It was AMAZING. The sandwich was HUGE - I had to take half of it home. I ordered the potato salad as the side and that was really good, too. But how good the food tastes is pretty much the only thing going on for Chompie's, I think. The service was a little slow, and the food is kind of pricey. Also, the pickles they gave us at the beginning gave both me and my boyfriend maaaad stomach aches. If I ever go back, I'm definitely staying away from the pickles."}
{"text":"The deli was a joke, the bakery was overpriced and their matzoh ball soup was nothing to write home about! Save your money, go to Safeway better bakery goods and much cheaper!"}
{"text":"I have to write an update to this chompie's review as they were a special part of one of the most amazing days, our Wedding in October 2014. due to my crazy love of Rainbow Cookies, I had the wonderful idea of having a rainbow cookie wedding cake so all of our wedding guests could share in the chocolatey deliciousness. Instead of actually having a full wedding cake, made the same way rainbow cookies are made, I ordered 15 pounds of rainbow cookies and then they were stacked in towers on a dessert table for us. The bite size of the cookies is what makes it extra special. The Staff was super helpful, delivered it on time to the venue and even communicated with our planner to provide stands for the cookies that matched my decor. We also used chompies the next day for bagels, cream cheeses, coffee, etc. for our wedding brunch. delivery that morning was also smooth and everyone loved the food. communication was on point throughout my entire planning process and It was so nice to have those pieces of New York for our wedding weekend."}
{"text":"I love the food but the servers sometimes suck and it happens only when they're not busy which is silly and annoying at the same time since they have no reason to be! But I do really really love the food! Especially their pastries"}
{"text":"Love this place-we mostly do take out, although we've sat at the bar & had a drink & a snack & that was great as well. Being from NY, Ivan attest to the fact that the bagels are fantastic. And their cookies???  To die for!!  The feather in their cap though is their cakes. For the second year, I got my daughter's birthday cake here...it's amazing & absolutely beautiful. Everyone is SO helpful & nice-they walked us through what they could do & made suggestions, and this is what we got!!!!"}
{"text":"Today the mother in law brought over a bag of cookies from the bakery. It says sell by nov 11 the problem is that is a month from now and they are stale all ready I hope it's a mistake.  Just awful old baked goods."}
{"text":"I have never eaten here before and I don't think I will ever come back. I arrived around 5:30 pm with my parents, my son, and my niece. Chompie's has a patio so we asked to sit outside. There were other people sitting outside as well. The hostess said, \"Let me check to see if someone will serve you out there.\" From my experience working at restaurants with patios, if someone wants to sit outside, you seat them outside. Anyways, she came back and said, \"Oh the patio is closed now.\" Since when do restaurants close the patio especially on a beautiful day like yesterday? I wanted to complain, but just shrugged it off. The menu is very large, but nothing looked very appetizing to me. I ordered the caesar salad and baked potato soup. The soup was okay, but the salad was not very good. It was mostly iceberg lettuce and did not have much taste at all. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"I been here a few time laterand this place never disappoints.  I have had breakfast and lunch/dinner items here and they were both very good.  Love the iced tea here as well! 

Be sure to grab dessert from the bakery on your way out.  Way too many options to choose from!  Definitely will return!!"}
{"text":"Service was fine the surprise was that the bread that came with my salad was stale! Hmmm they're known for their bagels and bread yet I got stale bread, not even warm. Salad was fine and will be back. I love the pickles. The bright green ones."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to Katz's, you know the value of way too  much meat piled up on good rye bread. This is at least a good try at hitting NY. They have matzo ball soup, pastrami piled high, knishes, etc. Have had breakfast items, lunch items, all good. The atmosphere is upbeat, good graphics on the walls, \"almost oldies music\" that my mom listened to when I was a kid. Service is good. Easy parking for Tempe. Grab some bagels or baked goods on the way out for your coworkers."}
{"text":"This is the greatest place for diner food. Sandwiches are HUGE, staff is quick and polite... they also have a bar. Perfect keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Wow! Loved the service, I felt like I was walking into my families house for dinner. I felt welcomed and taken care of. Jey was our waiter. He was funny, gave great recommendations and spent time with us. Didn't feel rushed to order and the food was great. We ordered the Original Jewish Sliders- yummy!!! First bite was everything! Overall, going back and I highly recommend it, the vibe was great."}
{"text":"Went again today and actually had to leave without eating or so much as receiving coffee! This place and I just DO NOT AGREE."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I absolutely love this place! I've tried several of their menu items and have never been disappointed with the food. The service isn't always the best but the food definitely makes up for it. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is where we always go for Mother's Day since menu, which is more like a book, can accommodate both  the youngest picky eater, and the elderly picky eater.  Even though the menu can be intimidating, it would be very far fetched to say that someone could like NOTHING on the menu.

You can get anything from plain pancakes, to extravagant omelets, to a simple hotdog, to a plethora of smoked fish, to a healthy salad, to a massive burger covered in ranch dressing.  And I am not even kidding - you can have a traditional thanksgiving meal of turkey, gravy, cranberry sauce and potato, covered in cheese, and stuffed into a slider - any day of the week.

I enjoy  the fact that they serve breakfast all day, coupled with the fact that there is a full bar, and ordering wine or beer or gin and tonic with  your pancakes is perfectly reasonable.

The service has never been bad, but it has been slow. However, Chompies provides all-you-can-eat dill pickles that are everything you would expect from pickles at a jewish deli.  

If the menu is intimidating, stick to the stuff that Chompies is known for - massive sandwiches, sliders on challah bread, and bagels.  In fact, next to the door there is a clearance rack of day old bagels, which last a long time, especially in  the freezer.  There are 12 bagels per bag, for $2.50.  At Costco, a dozen of bagels costs $5 and at the grocery store, a half a dozen bagels cost $5, so this is a great deal if you embrace carbs like us."}
{"text":"My niece requested Chompie's while in town visiting from the east coast. It is a safe selection since there is something for everyone. Unless you hate food, there is bound to be something you like.  Except if you are my grandma, who was not pleased that the tongue listed on the menu was not available. 

But, really, out of all the burgers, omelets, smoked fish, salads and schnitzel on the menu, why would one want to order tongue in the first place? Just get pastrami!

She did order wine to drown her sorrow, which arrived in an impressively large and  filled to the rim wine glass. It was perhaps the largest serving of wine I have seen at a restaurant.  In my opinion, this totally outweighs the lack of beef tongue.  My impossible-to-please grandmother may disagree, but luckily she cannot remember how to operate the web browser on her computer to write Yelp reviews.

We usually go to the Tempe location but I was just as pleased with the Chandler location. Perhaps more pleased for the following two reasons:
1) In addition to the complimentary pickles, there was also complimentary bread. This may not be specific to location, it could just be a new implementation. Regardless, I like bread.  
2) In addition to the normal sampling of crumb cake at the bakery counter, there was also sampling of cookies.  FULL-SIZED COOKIES.  Nothing starts a meal better than a chocolate dipped, sprinkled covered, buttery cookie. Well played, Chompies, well played.

As always, they had a display case full of temptations: 7 layers of chocolate cake, cupcakes doubled in height by frosting, and cookies the size of Frisbees.

And, as if their menu was not big enough, they had added quite a few new options, such as a kale salad and flat-bread pizzas.  Everything was very tasty and as usual, my brother made it a personal challenge to eat as much food as possible (he managed 4 sliders and a plateful of onion rings). It was fascinating and horrified my grandmother, who just couldn't bring herself to look away."}
{"text":"So far the only thing that is impressing me about this placed that has been hyped up for me is my food. Apparently it takes 30 minutes to prepare 2 bagel sandwiches but they can take over 10 + to go orders with ease. Guess where I'm not ever coming to. 

Maybe the taste of the food will change my mind."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and I always leave satisfied.  I've been for breakfast, brunch, a Yelp event, and just takeout.  Every time I get a ton of value and great food.  

Wednesday's are an especially good day for value if you want to hook up the office with bagels.  They do 18 for the price of 12.  Throw in a half pound of cream cheese and you're taking care of a lot of people on the cheap!  

Regarding the food...everything is good.  I love the bagels, the smoked salmon, the pastrami is killer, and the sliders are awesome.  

The wait can be long because of all these things.  If you're showing up at 10am on Saturday don't expect a table in 5 minutes.  Prepare to wait but you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Had not been here for a long time.  disappointed.  not as good as i remember.  will not return."}
{"text":"Levi was our waiter and he was awesome!!! Service was quick and friendly always made sure we had exactly what we wanted. Called over the manager and complimented such great food and service. Will be back all the time! Delicious!"}
{"text":"My mother and I shared the traditional corned beef Reuben and potato latkes for lunch today. Both were excellent!! I wish that this restaurant would open locations on the east coast. A must try! Huge portions and reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Wow what a menu, you could probably come here multiple times a week and it would still take you a long time to try everything! Initially waited for the hostess to finish her texting before she greeted and seated us but our waiter was awesome and the food came out quick! They have so many varieties of bagels and cream cheese you can buy, low carb loafs of breads, pastries, cookies and cakes. Will definitely be back when we get the chance."}
{"text":"Good jewish deli.   Usually get the Pastrami reuben half with soup combo.  Kind of pricey but it's good.  If they have Chocolate Eclair's get one just for the heart stopping goodness."}
{"text":"Breakfast of champions.  This is my staple for a great breakfast or bagels and I always take out of town guests here."}
{"text":"What a treat to have some terrific deli food.  Veggie knish, matzo ball soup, lox . . . it's all here and it's all tasty. I would eat here at least once a week (or more) if we lived in the area.  We have to drive from Prescott to get our deli craving satisfied . . . and it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Deli was fine, but prices were expensive.  Corned beef was VERY fatty.  Too bad they basically the only game in town"}
{"text":"Gosh, I wish we had a Chompies out in So. Orange Co. 
We were here on a Friday night for a dinner party in their back room. There were 50-60 of us. 
Once we all settled down and started to look over the menu the waiters/servers came by to take our drink orders. They came back fast with our drinks. Our orders were then taken. Soups came out in a timely manner and so did our entrees. 
The soups were reminiscent of our moms home cooking. Chicken Soup with Matzo Ball. Heavenly. 
Our entrees which were sandwiches pretty good. 
Okay, I got the brisket on Challah. It came with a gravy but I would of preferred Au jus. The brisket was a little on the dry side. I should of gotten pastrami. My son said it was great!. My husband enjoyed his corned beef sandwich on rye. 
So for the food I would give maybe 3 to 3 1/2 stars. But because the service was outstanding, especially with such a large group, I'm bumping up to 5 stars. The service was fantastic!!! 
Come on Chompies, open a restaurant out by me, Please."}
{"text":"Great breakfasts if you stick to their strengths--bagels, challah, potato pancakes, lox, etc. The breakfast sliders are fantastic, and my wife is a huge fan of the breakfast tapas.

Skip the skillets, scrambles (with the possible exception of the Leo), omelets, and regular diner fare; this really isn't where Chompie's talents lie and they've been a disappointment every time I've strayed.

Oh, and watch your step getting out of your booth. Why they thought it was wise to make you step up 6 inches to sit in them is beyond me."}
{"text":"Never been to Chompie's before but heard so much about it from my son I had to take him when he got in town from L.A.  OMG..he was right!  The food--and the service--were A+.
Had the Reuben cause it has been dog years since I had a real one, and it was a goodie, too.  The entire meal was so huge that I know I was waddling out the door when it was over
They also have a really yummy bakery there, so we stopped and got some treats to go home with, too.
This is not a cheap place to eat, tho, but you get so much it becomes 2 meals in one order.  I think I took half my Reuben home to eat later it was so big.  
Overall, I'll go back.  Probably when I have a big eater with me."}
{"text":"Under normal circumstances, I would never go out of my way to eat at Chompie's. In fact, the only reason I stopped by was because I was in the mall running errands. With all the intense racial hatred in the news right now, I figured a black and white cookie might be the solution.

I'd feel guilty just checking in on Yelp and taking my cookie and leaving, so I ordered a standard bagel sandwich with egg, cheddar cheese, and bacon. Honestly, I wasn't really impressed. Having been spoiled by breakfast/brunch spots in recent years, I shouldn't have been surprised. The sandwich, as a whole, was just incredibly dry and dull. Some people rave about their New York deli styled sandwiches, so perhaps that's where their true skills are.

The black and white cookie was fine for what it was. But then again, I don't think I've ever had one that wasn't fine. I found it incredibly odd that the man taking my order (and the manager) had never seen the Yelp check-in offer before and admitted that they had no idea it existed. 

Interestingly enough, I also picked up a mini-bagel dog treat for fifty cents. The treat, which appeared to be a dog biscuit, was so offensively hard that I sent my girlfriend a comical video of me repeatedly slamming it against my granite countertops and dropping it on the ceramic tile. The thing is practically a hockey puck! While I was eventually able to \"crack\" the bagel in half, my dog had absolutely no interest in eating it. Although this is probably for the best, as I doubt he'd even be able to chew the damned thing.

I'm sure they offer some items that are decent, but aside from my free cookie, Chompie's just isn't really my kind of place.

Sorry!"}
{"text":"I haven't drifted away from Chompies.  I very much enjoy their deli sandwiches, and have yet to find anything that can come close to the options, price and most importantly, the taste.  The Corned Beef, it's lean, well prepared, piled high...
On the marble rye with Muenster cheese and mustard 
-for me, it's a dream date.
And before I forget, a half sandwich is more than enough.  The server told me it's like six ounces of meat on the half sandwich.
Come on, meat, bread, an accompaniment (coleslaw, potato salad, French fries, other).  How much more so ya need?!
The whole sandwich is eight ounces piled high on your choice of bread or roll.  Oh, and before I forget, they have a few gluten free options too.
Something to consider if you're in the GF train like so many are and more of us are learning we probably should be too.
But anyway, their deli sandwiches are probably the BEST in the Valley.  Heck, maybe even the entire state of Arizona ftm."}
{"text":"Try their pastrami sandwich. Beware, it is huge! They offer a half portion. Lots of parking and adequate seating."}
{"text":"If there was a support group for individuals addicted to both coffee and bagels, you would find me there. Chompie's is my go to place for a delicious/fresh and cheap bagel and coffee on my way into the office.  They have a pretty large selection of bagel flavors as well as cream cheese flavors and service is always friendly and efficient. 
I have dined in their actual restaurant several times and never had a bad meal or experience. If you looking for some fantastic jewish deli fare, Chompie's is your best bet!"}
{"text":"New Christmas tradition! I had a cold on Christmas and Chicken soup with matzo ball and original Jewish slider combo hit the spot. Happy, friendly, upbeat staff throughout the restaurant. Richard  was a great server. My picky teens agree Chompies should be a Christmas tradition."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was. The meat was fresh and made in house. The matzah ball soup was so good and tasted homemade. I didn't try the deserts, but the red velvet cake sure did tempt me."}
{"text":"Delicious! Outstanding! Can't wait for more. I have been to their Chandler location but this was the first time at Arrowhead and it was great for lunch. I got the fabulous ruben and my sister had the turkey and boy was the meat piled high! The pickles were great, the potato wedges hit the spot and coleslaw was yummo. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are simply amazing! I could sit and eat them all day. The meat was so tender and moist it melted in your mouth. I also loved the greek salad. I could not get enough of the olives! Such a fun place. So excited they are going to open one on the West Side !"}
{"text":"came here with the intention of grabbing some stuff from the counter and i see my wife walking to a table with the greater,, so i guess we are eating here. I ordered the chompies deep fried french toast and thought that would be right up my alley but i didnt like it at all. very disappointed. 
if we go back i will stick to some egg type dish or to the bakery."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch here. Roast beef sandwich! The roast beef was fantastic, there was enough beef to possibly make two or three sandwiches. The manager and waiter were very friendly and attentive. I can't wait to come back and try some of the pastries they have! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"COCKROACH CLIMBING UP THE WALL! The experience I would rate at 4 stars. The food was well seasoned and the staff was friendly. However when we were finishing up our meal we saw this HUGE cockroach climbing up the wall, we rushed out and threw away our leftovers. Very disappointed that they aren't spending the money on keeping their restaurant bug free."}
{"text":"This is a Jewish Deli that i imagine brings memories to many peeps from back east or growing up with such a place. They have lots of choices so dont be intimidated. Many of the breakfast items can be ordered in a variety of ways if you ate not into this kind of food like me. My friend had the sliders which had lunchmeat (i think turkey) with a potato cake between the meat and the bun. From our Waiter, I learned that apparently thats what Chompies is known for. Arrowhead has a great patio. If you \"check-in\" on yelp you get a black and white cookie!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Chompie's that hasn't already been said? This place is amazing - delicious food, friendly staff, a clean building and oh, did I mention the delicious food? I never miss a chance to go to Chompie's."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! The food is amazing and the staff are so beyond friendly and welcoming! I even order them via DoorDash when I'm at work. I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"The food here is reliably excellent and filling. Their bagels and cream cheese are the best in the area - and I'm picky. They offer a huge selection of breakfast items which is great when we all go out for weekend breakfast. My husband loves the variety of eggs and meats. They offer whole grain pancakes with blueberries, and even the short stack is enough to bring home leftovers. The decor transports you back to NYC and having spent most of my life near the Big Apple it is fun to look at the signs and photos.  Their selection of sweets in the long case is mouth-watering and very tempting."}
{"text":"Chompies is my new favorite Deli! Everything we ordered was on point! Waiter, Issac, was exceptional!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times and each time it is just awesome, the original sliders are the best sliders I have ever had. But everything on the menu looks tasty."}
{"text":"Foods good or above average but you pay for it.  I didn't see any great deals or even average deals.  It  would have been better if it was warm thus brings us to the service. Both times I have been there the wait staff were in way over their heads and realy didn't seem to care.  Even the bus boys seemed lost.  BY the time we got our food it was cold and you could tell it had been sitting around for awhile. Our order was wrong from appitizer to entree to drinks and no offer for dessert even if we had wanted it.  Totally forgot  the appitizer with no kind compensation of since they messed up.  Drinks were empty most of the meal and I'm a slow drinker. That said, we did like the food.  But I won't be going out of my way to eat there again.  We drove in from the east valley  to eat there, but it's just not worth the gas."}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times. They always cut your bagels and spread cream cheese free of charge on the purchasers bagels. Well the last two times I've been at this location I've gotten bagels thrown in a bag (not even wrapped), bagels not cut and I was charged for cream cheese as I had to buy my own because they refused to spread them. 

The customer service level from the two take out To go ladies was horrible and the fact that they didn't wrap, cut or spread my bagels is very lazy and unprofessional. I've always heard great things and have loved this restaurant but lately they have been horrible.  Don't go to this location as they lack consistency."}
{"text":"Never been to one of these before, but other family members had. We actually had a little thanksgiving dinner here. The food was good. The service was good. No complaints."}
{"text":"The best deli I have ever been to. Practically heaven. I would recommend it to anybody. I almost went three days in a row (and I was on a 7 day vacation), because there was so much good food to eat, and I wanted to have as much as I could."}
{"text":"This review is for the gluten free folks.  I was craving a gluten free bagel & was excited to see a Jewish deli with gf bagels!!! One bite took me from excitement  to disappointment.  It was quite possibly the worst gf bagel I've ever had. Dense, dry, sweet - nothing I would want in a bagel. The frozen bagels like udi's are far superior. The low fat cream cheese was good though.  

Then there was the gf chocolate rugulah. It looks like rugulah but doesn't have the right consistency. I think they try to make up for it with sugar... It was like a sugar bomb went off in my mouth.  But it wasn't horrible.  I would try the sugar cookie instead- at least that may work out"}
{"text":"After window shopping, we stopped off for dinner. I had the 1/2 Pastrami on an Everything bagel with Matzo Ball soup and my wife had the Roast Beef Sandwich.
I've never been disappointed with their food at any of their other locations.
The bagel was the freshest I have ever eaten with a sandwich.
Service good, we got there before the evening rush."}
{"text":"Before heading out to the Arizona Auto Show, my wife and I decided to have lunch here. The place was PACKED, had to wait about 10 minutes. We ordered our sandwiches: Wife had half Egg Salad Sandwich with lettuce and sprouts; I had the half-sandwich combo with chicken noodle soup. My sandwich was pastrami on marble rye and no cheese.
The soup was delicious with lots of chicken, noodles and vegetables. It wasn't had hot as I would like it, but it was good. 
The waitress brought out a whole Egg Salad sandwich and when I got mine, it was a whole sandwich with toasted rye, melted cheese with sauerkraut.  We both sent our sandwiches back and my wife's came back the way she ordered it and the pastrami sandwich was on rye with cheese. I wasn't going to send it back a second time.
At the end of our meal, we ordered bagel chips, apparently they were all sold out. But our waitress managed to get some from the pantry and didn't charge us.
The meal was satisfying with pastrami about two inches high. I would have given this a 4 star, but not getting our order right the first time, I had to take a star away."}
{"text":"In one word it would be \"Excellent\", I don't think we could say enough on how good the breakfast is here. This place has the best scrambled eggs I have ever had in a restaurant. My daughter had corned beef hash and it was wonderful."}
{"text":"Yeah it's a little pricey, yeah it's usually crowded...
But, the food is awesome and the portions are plentiful.
Their bagels are delicious and fresh, and the lox spread is my favorite. I never have to eat the same thing twice, because their menu is HUGE. They serve breakfast all day, have a take-out counter and an amazing bakery. Try the Lace cookies and the Brooklyn 7-layer cake ...amazeballs!!"}
{"text":"I love their egg sandwiches! Finally I can get breakfast as good as I did back in NY. Egg, ham and cheese on an EGG BAGEL! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Huge portions and great food.  Excellent staff priced fair.  Loved this place, will be back."}
{"text":"A group of friends met at Chompies at Paradise Valley Mall for breakfast on Sunday, St. Patrick's Day.  Our waiter was Donald.  He is, by far the rudest waiter we have ever had at this restaurant.  He walks away while you are still talking to him.  He does not acknowledge requests, such as refills on coffee.  He got all of the orders wrong, even though he wrote them all down.  There were three couples in our group; he split the check in two groups of three people.  Who does that?????? One person in our group said that they would NEVER come to this Chompies again.  However, we have always had good food and good service in the past, so we will return.  However, we will definately ask NOT to be placed at Donald's table.  I read another review that sounds like it is also him.  Management should replace him with someone who is not rude and can read his own orders."}
{"text":"Maybe an okay deli but these are the lousiest $6 salad I've ever had or seen. I was expecting some decent slices of egg based on description-- I guess I expected too much because those 2 little guys are almost the size of a quarter. My son's meal was blah, 1 slice of toast very tough , the other just slightly tough."}
{"text":"Egg bagels for dayyyyyyyyyyyyyssss.

I bet they also have other good things. Probably a lot. I mean, they've been open for a long while, right? 

Their cookies are good. Sliders are great. I remember getting their corned beef sandwich and it was probably enough to feed a family of four. One time I sat on the patio while people watching and had a turkey burger with sweet potato fries and it was REALLY good, now that I think of it. 

However, generally speaking, I err towards breakfast because, really, it's the best meal and Chompie's serves it all day. Eggciting with eggs over medium and an egg bagel. Wall Street Lox and bagel. Chompie Benedict or the Biltmore Benedict (lox and havarti... YUM). 

Get a free breakfast on your birthday by flashing your ID. They sell bags of discounted day old bagels that you can snag and freeze. 

I came in yesterday with my kiddo to get bagels, but he spent his time drooling at the cookies. The girl behind the counter was the absolute sweetest. She slyly asked me out of his hearing range if she could give him a tiny sprinkle sugar cookie. Let me tell you, he carried his bag of cookie so proudly throughout the mall. Anyway, the point is, the customer service is friendly and amazing. 

Now I'm hungry. 

p.s. 200th review!"}
{"text":"I was a big fan of Chompies for years, but I just can't do it anymore - it's been a broken relationship for a while now. I keep coming back when I know it isn't good for me

The service at this location is the worst- seriously understaffed - 

We sat for ten minutes until a manager came by to get a drink order while we waited for our waiter- who is waiting on who?

this time around I got the sliders and wife got a salad with a side of ranch dressing....they forgot the ranch...it took ten minutes and asking 2 people in order to get her dressing 

I asked for a side of apple sauce...it never came 

Sliders were tasty- I do enjoy them - but dinner for two took nearly an hour and a half

The food is just too expensive to warrant such bad service - 

Shalom chompies"}
{"text":"Skip the sit down and stick to the sandwiches or bagels. We ordered various items and they were all simply gross. The corned beef hash skillet- was yuck beyond explanation. Just don't do it. The French Toast- couldn't even eat it and worse than frozen grocery store French toast sticks. The OJ we were told wasn't made here but that they get it from the orchard... tasted like tang but maybe worse. The powdered hot chocolate was bearable but the only reason we got that stuff was so I didn't feel bad sending the OJ back and asking the waiter to remove items from the check. I don't recommend this place. The waiter was very nice and an interesting guy. Really just the food that is terrible."}
{"text":"They can be hit and miss. The samwiches are allways good but other items not as well. Example the potato pancakes are allways slightly burnt. I ordered the cabbage rolls while good were warm not hot."}
{"text":"As someone who has been to NYC, this is definitely true deli food.  Chompies offers traditional deli selections (pastrami, corned beef, etc) and a wide variety of other menu items.  The size of the plates are huge, so good value for money.

Restaurant has a relaxed atmosphere with a NYC subway theme.  This place gets busy over lunch time, but service was quick. 
 
I also like the breakfast they serve - bagel sandwiches in the morning.  There is also a huge selection of deserts behind the counter to go.  This place is more than just what you see on Man versus food with the Jewish Slider challenge, there is a lot more to this place."}
{"text":"I took my dad to the resturant a couple months ago and the first time for him was a good experiance.  the second day we went back it was not so good experiance.  So I have waited a couple months to go back and may never go back again.  We watied forever to get our food, about 45 min, when i approached the hostess to check she said no, this nice young waiter said he would, and poof it was out.  Not to mention they were still wrapping the silverware by grabing the fork by the prongs and not the bottom part, big health violation.  When i did get my order the waitress gave me the wrong bagel and she forgot the home fries.  I am seeing a pattern that one should sit in the male waiter section because they are not bitchy.  It is sad for the waitresses, because i have been know to tip a 100% of my bill since breakfast is so reasonable.  I don't think the owners and managers that the attitude of the young ladies is so poor and that reflects badly on the resturant.  I don't think i will go back to this one for a long time."}
{"text":"Its amazing what they can do in 5 months away can do.  It was like nigjt and day from the last time I visited.  I hope they continue up the good work."}
{"text":"Made it back to my old college stomping grounds after a several year hiatus, and all I gotta say is Chompies, it's good to be back! Why oh why did I stay away so long??

Went there for lunch the other day with the always lovely Gabi K., after I was hit with an insatiable desire to have breakfast for lunch.  We arrived at 12:30 and the place was pretty packed but we were seated right away.

Now, I should probably fess up to the fact that I have been ordering the same exact thing at Chompies for 8 years now, and see no sign of switching any time soon, because it is perfect.  I get the greek omelette with American cheese, an everything bagel, and hashbrowns, and it is an instant party in my mouth.

Gabi ordered a soup and salad combo (which I didn't even know they had since I never get past the breakfast page) and it truly looked delicious.  Seriously looked like one of the better looking salads I've seen around Tempe.

In the business of full disclosure, our waitress did falter with both of our orders.  She forgot Gabi's soup and she did not make the sub to American cheese in my omelette as I requested.  Neither of us are difficult diners though so we rolled with it and continued our gabfest.

What really pushes Chompies over the 3 star line for me is all of the extra goodies in and around the display cases in the front.  Black and white cookies? Check! Real, authentic chocolate rugelach? You better believe it!  And my personal favorite, acutal Wise brand Cheese Doodles!!! Not Cheetos, of Cheese Puffs, or any of that knockoff crap, actual delicious, heavenly Cheese Doodles, my favorite snack of years past when I lived in the Northeast.  You wouldn't believe how difficult they are to find in AZ! 

But not to worry, I can get them every time that breakfast for lunch craving hits, and I almost always do."}
{"text":"Staff ignored a customer smoking an E-CIGARETTE at the dining area. Not to mention the food was horrible! I don't understand how management can tolerate this in a family environment. Staff displayed how little they care about their family customers. The bathrooms were disgusting and the customer service was below average."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are sitting at this location for breakfast...usually places with an insane amount of choices aren't great because they can't focus on perfecting signature dishes, this is true for chompies! We ordered blueberry pancakes and the fitness omelette plate. The only thing we thought was okay was the jalapeño bagel. They should just stick to bagels. And we paid $6 for orange juice. You know you're struggling when you have to decorate your restaurant with Pokemon stuff and advertise yourself as a prime poke destination to gain business hahah!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and better service! We have eaten here before and both times they were very nice and fast. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Chompie's is the best New York Deli in the valley. Then again, there really isn't very much great competition. But it's still great food. 

The menu is filled with the classics that you'd expect to find in any New York Deli. It's all fit to be eaten at any time during the day. 
The prices may look steep at first. But wait until you see the portions. It'll be your lunch for at least two days!"}
{"text":"It's hard to judge a restaurant based on a single visit with a large group, but service was so awful at this Chompie's that there is no way I would ever make the drive to meet anyone at this location again.

A friend of mine was in town but only had limited time to meet up, so a group of about 15 people (plus three small children) decided to meet for lunch.  We did the smart thing and called ahead to let them know that such a large party was planning to dine there at 1:30.  We were seated in a \"party room\" which had a TV, fireplace, and plenty of room, which was nice, but it also was dirty.  Three tables had previous diners' dirty dishes and cutlery left on them.  The floor hadn't been swept.  And, one busser stopped in and cleaned off only one of those table during the two hours we were stuck in there.

So now for the real problem...  We were seated in this dirty room and after a few minutes a waiter came in.  We all ordered food and drinks.  It became very obvious the one server assigned to our group was overwhelmed.  It must have been at least 10 to 15 minutes before we started to see any of those drinks.  I don't know how long it takes to pour drinks for 15 people, but couldn't someone at least bring some pitchers of water and glasses during that time?  Drinks finally arrived.  Then nothing.  It was an hour later when some pickles were brought to the table.  I'm not joking.  An hour later and our meals still weren't ready.  It was 2:30 in the afternoon.  I was planning on being at least getting ready to pay my bill by that time.  Fortunately, none of the kids were complaining, but at least make sure they got their orders in a fair amount of time.  Everyone was hungry.  Neither the server nor the food were anywhere to be seen.  When our orders finally arrived at 3:00, the trays were placed on one the still dirty tables (a few of us noticed, but everyone was too hungry to complain).  The saving grace was that none of the orders were wrong.  The waiter was smart enough to bring free cookies with the bill, but the only reason none of us got a manger and complained was because it was nearly 3:30 and we all had places to go and just wanted to get out.

The one redeeming part of the visit is that the food is the same as every other Chompie's.  Which is excellent.  The ambiance is modern instead of old fashion deli.  But the service was a complete fail.  They knew a big group was coming, if they were unable to accommodate us, they should have warned us."}
{"text":"Stopped in for bread, ended buying biscotti, chocolate chip almond.  The best store bought I have had in a very long time. Need to go and get some bagels."}
{"text":"I've already expressed my love for Chompies in my review of the Tempe location, but after having brunch at this location this morning, I need to do the same for Scottsdale. 

I'm not usually a fan of big menus. But since pretty much everything at Chompies is good, let them cook whatever they want. I met a friend here at 11am and had some trouble deciding between breakfast or lunch. As I looked through the menu, the omelets caught my eye. I had the Spanish Omelet which has black beans, onions, tomato, cheddar and jalapeno jack cheese. It also comes with potatoes and a bagel or toast for $8.50. Not only Delicious, but I'm set for the day."}
{"text":"New York style restaurant. The decor makes you feel like you are in NY. Great food, feels fresh and made with care. People are very nice and friendly. I had a great breakfast. Would love to visit again. Its very close to ASU campus. What I loved the most was the pricing."}
{"text":"We heard good things about the place from friends so we went there a few weeks ago for lunch. Not impressed at all. Service was slow and the servers not very friendly. The food was only Ok.... Thinking perhaps we caught them on a bad day, we decided to give them another try and grab some breakfast this morning. Big mistake. Again, the servers were slow and rude and the food mediocre at best. Won't make the same mistake again."}
{"text":"Ordered a breakfast sandwich through a meal delivery service and 1. The description of the sandwich said that it came with cheddar on it and there was no cheese on the sandwich I received 2. I asked for overeasy eggs and the yolks were completely cooked through 3. I asked for cream cheese and received none. So basically I just got a dry breakfast sandwich with no cheese, no sauce, and no yolks to create a sauce. So disappointed :("}
{"text":"It's Mother's Day but this service was unacceptable. The food came at different times and missing items."}
{"text":"Just got a \"jumbo half\" turkey breast to-go that was not very jumbo at all and was just meat and bread except for the cheese I paid extra for. Definitely NOT worth $10.49 + extra for cheese. The baked goods looked amazing though so maybe I will go back for just dessert."}
{"text":"I went to the PV Mall location of Chompie's for the first time recently for lunch.  I hadn't been to Chompie's since they moved from their Greenway location.  The three of us were seated quickly and greeted shortly thereafter by our waiter.  After a few minutes of deciding, we ordered.  I split one of their big ol' sandwiches with my wife.  Can't remember the name, but it was named after something in NY (brooklyner, holland tunnel, staten island, etc.).  It was basically a sandwich with turkey and roast beef piled high, with an extra piece of rye bread in the middle.  We liked it, but my jaw hurt afterwards from trying to jam that huge sandwich in my pie-hole, oh vey!  

The other person in our party ordered some type of sandwich, along with a Dr. Brown's Cream Soda.  Can't go wrong there, however, at one point, our waiter came over with another can of soda when the original cup was just about drained.  As far as I'm aware, there was no discussion of the additional can, it just appeared, which would make it seem as if it was complimentary.  Unfortunately, it did appear on the bill...at $2.29 (or something like that) each, that is quite the refill fee, especially for someone that didn't ask!  We didn't fuss about that, but it is definitely a major annoyance to me, when places don't have free refills, but give you said refill as if it were free, not even asking if you'd like.  

On the way out, we hit the bakery for the bagels and some black and whites.  We got some pumpkin (and other assorted) bagels, but no black and whites.  Why not, you ask?  Because for the season, they had orange and browns!  Feeling festive we got a couple of these.  Maybe they should call the originals brown and whites, because the chocolate frosting didn't change color.  The orange frosting was just the normal frosting with food coloring.  But they were as good as black and whites usually are, so no complaints.  The bagels over the next few days were good as well.

Three stars for Chompie's.  Probably would have been a four if not for the 'soda incident'."}
{"text":"I used to love Chompies...but my experience is disappointing today or I just ordered the wrong thing. Was in the mood for a high stacked turkey deli sandwich.  ordered it to go and for $18 you would think it would be the best tasting turkey ever..It is dry, tasteless, came with nothing on it (had to ask after the fact) and the side of potato salad so bland also. best tasting thing was the pickle on the side! To round up to a $20 lunch (Ugh, a stupid mistake) I ordered an oatmeal raisen cookie..it was dry and disappointing. The female server behind the counter was so sweet tho..the only reason I give Chompies 2 stars today."}
{"text":"I've been here before for a great corned beef sandwich at lunch, but had never been for breakfast until last Sunday.  The breakfast menu is HUGE making a decision a chore. OKC (where I live) is not exactly known as a lox mecca so I had to go with the tried and true hand-cut nova and bagel.  A nice doughy chewy delicious bagel, plenty of capers, thick slices of bermuda onion and melt-in-your-mouth nova (plus the obligatory schmear).Plus the portions are always enormous. I should have stopped (but couldn't) at just half the bagel and lox. My niece and nephews joined me so I got to witness my very thin niece polish off fluffy pancakes so large they would have killed me and my nephews polish off corned beef hash (for one) and bagel breakfast skins (the other). Again huge delicious portions and not a teeny morsel left from one of us at the table. Plus great attentive service. So why not 5 stars? I'm a tough grader."}
{"text":"For a white/hispanic/german dude this place was OFF THE HOOK GOOD!! It matched all my taste buds needs. The jewish sliders are so tasty with the fries and gravy. Our server David was really great and funny and kept our drinks full. The cookies at the counter kept the kids enthralled and the prices, great food and great service kept me more than thrilled."}
{"text":"I walked in to get deserts for my work team.  I needed 20 items at an average price of $3 and one person was in line before me.  The counter girl finished with the person in front of me and said she would be right back.  She danced around, chatted, came back 4 minutes later and started helping the customer behind me.  I walked out.  Epic fail Chompies."}
{"text":"\"We wanted to take you out for your last dinner...so we got to thinking 'what place has specials on a Tuesday?'..and I remembered Chompie's has a special..AND A FOOD CHALLENGE.\"

And THAT is how I ended up at Chompie's on a Tuesday.  They were featured on TV (I think it's Man Vs. Food, but I'm not sure) bc of this food challenge of theirs.  On Tuesdays, they have a special - AYCE Jewish sliders & fries with the purchase of a beverage for $11.95.  (Keep in mind, a plate of 3 Jewish sliders + fries is $11.95.)

I was told the specialties here are sliders.  The sliders themselves are a decent size (I'd say maybe it's the same size as the tiny McD's burgers, but taller?).  Jewish sliders have potato cakes in them; Western sliders don't; breakfast sliders are something completely different.

Everything we ordered was ehhhh (befitting of a \"meh, I've experienced better\" rating).  Two things that did impress me, however, were:

1. They place pickles on the table right when you sit down!  I'm not a pickle girl myself, but it's a nice gesture.
2. Everyone here is so FRIENDLY (I mean genuinely friendly!!).  Idk, I think most Arizonians in general are friendlier than the Californians I encounter on a daily basis hahahhaa.  And our waitress went out of her way to split 5 checks for our party of 7...that was pretty cool of her.

I'm glad I went here for the experience, but I wouldn't come back again.  Lesson learned: Don't trust a bunch of post-gym, hungry, non-Yelping boys to pick a dinner spot ;)"}
{"text":"I ordered the half sandwich and soup. For the soup I got the kreplach and the sandwich salami on rye. The kreplach was very hearty. The sandwich, OMG, was piled so high with salami I had to take a bunch off just to get it in my mouth. I'm not complaining, but wow. The only issue was the bread wasn't very fresh, which Chompie's typically has the best bread.

The service was decent, but the restaurant wasn't very busy. The server was fine with me, but in overhearing him talk to the table next to me he was very new and didn't know squat about the menu."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The server was average. Food-not up to par with what I've had in the past. The mushroom barley has WAY TOO MUCH PEPPER in it. The potato pancakes are TOO THICK  and bland. The price for a sandwich is too much for what you get. Time to find another restaurant. .."}
{"text":"We visited for a sit-down brunch Saturday morning around 11ish, and it was busy, as expected. We only had to wait for 15 minutes, which wasn't bad. The place is very large, with plenty of seating, so that probably helped.

If they are going for a full and authentic New York City vibe, they nailed it. The service is what you would expect from a cheap 24-hour NYC diner. Our waitress was overwhelmed, and whenever she did finally get around to helping us and taking our order, it was as if we were inconveniencing her and we're not ordering fast enough. She didn't have the Brooklyn accent to go with the service, but the hostess's booming Brooklyn voice that you could hear throughout the building covered that area plenty.

The food was okay. No complaints, but nothing outstanding, either."}
{"text":"Delicious. Gigantic servings. You've been warned.

One of the few places I can find a Biltmore benedict (with lox). Anything with corned beef will be great; I love their corned beef hash (with Cholula)."}
{"text":"First, let me say that I absolutely LOVE Chompies. I work in Chandler, so they're a standby for our meetings and any trainings my company hosts. Today was my first time actually going TO this location with my friend. 

We were seated promptly, the place was clean, our server Denise was friendly, the salad I ordered was delicious . . . Until I found blonde hairs in it. VOMMMMIIIT. I showed Denise as she was about to bring out the check, and she had Bobbi the manager come out and apologize. I was comped for the meal. 

A star for service, comping the meal, and quality. See, this would be four stars . . .  but I just can't overlook the hair.  :("}
{"text":"I had visited another location when I just moved to phoenix a few years ago. I saw Man Vs Food and I was enticed into trying the Jewish Sliders. I wasn't that much of a fan. I found it to be too much carb and not enough meat. 

The gf and I were wondering around at the mall and wanted to eat something different so I revisited Chompies. We could tell by looking around that the serving sizes were pretty generous and it was lunch so we didn't want to be incapacitated for the day after a food overdose so we decided we'd try to share and see how it went.

We settled on Classic Grandpa Rubys, we opted for the corned beef. We were both impressed with the size of the sandwich and glad we decided to share. Between the fries, which were also pretty solid, and coleslaw we were satisfied. 

The corned beef was really good and I'll say it was some of the best corned beef I've ever had. That being said the prices are a little much in my opinion. It's 16.99 for one sandwich which satisfied us but for two people wasn't that much food. For that I give it minus a star, but it is what it is. We both wanted to come back and try some other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Came here since it was on Man vs. Food to try the food and see how it is. I ordered the Jewish Sliders that were made famous as on the show and boy was it good. I seriously can't explain just how amazing this plate is. Wish I lived in Arizona just to eat here. I didn't get a chance to try their bakery but it looks like it is really good and worth a stop. It definitely hit the spot. Beef brisket and a potato pancake sliders? Yes please! 

Must have meal: Original Jewish Sliders"}
{"text":"If you are looking to go out for some bagels and breakfast Chompies is a much better option than chain bagel stores. As for lunch I haven't been very impressed with what they have. Sure they bring you out pickles and cucumbers which is awesome in my book, but most of the dishes are boring American choices or Jewish cuisine which I don't really crave. I do want to go back and check out the bakery though.  They had a huge selection of tasty treats in the window last time I was there with a mixture of everything you could want. 

One thing that stands out in my mind about Chompies though is how dark it is in there. It gives it a very odd feel, and when you step back outside you are blinded by the Arizona sunshine. Let the sunshine in!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Chompies! I've been to this location many times and loved it every time.  There was an incident once - I ordered french toast and the wax paper was still stuck to the bottoms of every piece.  They were very receptive when I notified them of the issue and did not charge me or my boyfriend for the meal due to the issue.  Everything is always delicious and the staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this two stars because my husband loved his Rubens sandwich!  My barley soup and chef salad was deplorable!!  Terrible service  too,  the server did not answer questions about the menu. Understaffed on the Saturday before mother's day.  We wanted to sit on the patio,  but there were no servers willing to take patio tables,  we were told. I just had the feeling that everyone  did not have  consideration for the customers.  I will go back to the location on Shea!"}
{"text":"Came here one morning a couple of weeks ago.  Had about 50 minutes alloted before my Mayo clinic appointment, so I thought a short stack of banana-nut pancakes would get me in and out fast.  I thought wrong.  Staff was friendly enough, but it took at least 10 minutes for the server to finally take my order.  I asked for banana-nut pancakes, but instead of the pancake syrup (not pure maple), I wanted a side of the blueberry compote that usually comes w/ the blueberry pancakes.  Would this be OK?  Server said yes.  The short stack (2 cakes) arrived 15 minutes later, but instead of banana-nut pancakes, these were blueberries, delivered by another server.  My server came by to ask if I needed anything else, heard my complaint, and rushed back to the kitchen to correct it.  I was assured that it would only take 10 minutes to get a fresh batch out, but another 15 minutes went by before the correct order arrived.  Keep in mind, it's already been at least 40 minutes since I sat down.  I only had 10 minutes to spare- not enough to savor these delicious cakes.  The blueberry compote ended up containing corn syrup, the ingredient I was trying to avoid by not using the pancake syrup, but it's hard for me to resist blueberry compote, so if I must suffer...

I most likely will visit Chompie's again the next time I'm out and about and craving for pancakes, but only if I have 90 minutes or more to spare..."}
{"text":"Chompies is our \"go-to\" place when no one can agree on what they want for dinner. They cater to kids very well, both of my offspring love eating here because they can order a cup of soup or a grilled cheese. I have to say that I have never had a bad meal here. The wait staff is very kind (we usually leave a small tornado after leaving). There are nightly specials which my hubby loves. I am a fan because it is not a packaged food place like Chili's or Applebees."}
{"text":"This is a really great deli. It stacks up with the big name places that I have been to in NYC and Chicago. Very impressive.

They have both a sit down restaurant and take out area. I actually got a bit confused by that since most of the delis I have been to everyone goes through the takeout line and then sits down if they want or takes it out. oops! Other than that little bit of confusion I had a great experience. I got a pastrami sandwich that was piled SUPER high just like you would get out east. The pastrami was cut a bit on the thinner side, but it was VERY good. I got a side of potato salad that was also pretty good but nothing to call home about. 

Service was very nice... I couldnt decide between the corned beef or pastrami but the girl behind the counter said to go with the pastrami. The wait was not long at all for my food. I took my to go order outside and ate on the patio since it was a beautiful night. If I am ever back in the area I will definitely be coming back, maybe for some breakfast too since they had some good looking bagels and such."}
{"text":"I met a group of friends for a Sunday brunch here and the food is certainly the star here. I probably would give it four stars if the service and atmosphere were better.

I had Dave's Deli Benedict. It was good. The corned beef hash was cooked perfectly and I loved having latkes in place of english muffins. The hollandaise sauce was just okay and the eggs were not all the way poached. The hash and latkes definately stole the show on it. I subbed the fruit for the homefries and got a standard fruit cup filled mostly with melons. I also got a brownie for the road and enjoyed it at home later that day. It was DELICIOUS! Perfectly moist and rich. The rest of my table seemed to enjoy their food and despite a hoard of flies interupting our meal, we all ate well. 

I wish the service lived up to the food. I felt like our server was annoyed with our presence. She also forgot some of our drinks but we didn't remind her later. And once we asked for the check, it took another 15 minutes to get it so we could pay. I'll definatelly give the place another shot. Maybe the near end of the Sunday brunch was just bad timing."}
{"text":"The bread is small and dry. The meat was well flavored but not warm.... let alone hot. The sides are tiny.  12.00 for a half sandwich and a spoon of sale, and cup of soup.... they should try harder. Great service."}
{"text":"My roommates and I used to go to Chompie's in Tempe every Saturday morning when we were in college and everything was always great and we had a blast.  That was a LONG time ago.

Not anymore. I have been to this Paradise Valley Chompies many times in the past five years, but only to pick up a dozen bagels at the pastry counter.  I agree with other reviews here -- sometimes you get a friendly person and sometimes you get a surly asshat.

Yesterday was the first time I ever came in and sat down for lunch. I was by myself..  Here's how it went:

1. The hostess approached me immediately and walked to me what I will call a \"half booth\".  She said (AND I AM NOT KIDDING), \"Do you like to get romantic with yourself?\" and gestured toward the booth.  I looked down and the seating area was literally one side of a booth bench, the tabletop coming out of the wall opposite to where I would be sitting.  There was no other \"side\" of the booth (meaning another bench seat where people could sit across from each other).  

Mounted to the wall that the tabletop was anchored into was a sign that read \"Romance Booth\".  I guess it must be some weird attempt at humor, as I suppose the insinuation was that you could only sit adjacent to your fellow diner instead of across from him. Ha-fucking-ha.  Not amused.  I told her no, and that I don't want to spend my lunchtime staring at a wall.  She showed me to another booth that seemed normal.

Well, I think I got the tall, semi-bald guy, awful server to which other reviewers on this page have referred.  He took my drink order, and when he returned with it, sat it way across from me on the other side of the booth.  The glass must have been fresh from a dishwasher that did not have a drying cycle, because a GIANT pool of water immediately began to form around the glass. So when I lifted the glass to bring it closer than two feet away from me, the pool of water that had settled at the base of the glass was about the side of a salad plate.

I flagged down a busser and told her about the mini swimming pool on my table and she whipped out this already-saturated rag that looked like it had been pulled out of a filthy mop bucket and proceeded to spread the above-ground pool evenly all over my table, instead of going to get a DRY towel and mopping up the wetness.  It was absolutely disgusting.

Then the server brought my lunch.  I told him about the thin layer of germy swimming pool that had just been my table.  He made no acknowledgment or apology.I had ordered 1/2 a sandwich and a cup of split pea soup, which came with a thimble-full of coleslaw.

The entire cup of the soup had split pea STREAMING down all sides of it.  It looked as if someone had completely submerged the cup into the vat of soup, pulled it out and put it on my plate. The outside of the cup looked like it was wallpapered in split pea soup.  Super-disgusting incident #2.  It took me about four napkins to mop it all up.  And did the server return to take away the soaked napkins? No. It looked like a scene from The Exorcist.

I expressed my extreme displeasure to the oblivious server and he did absolutely nothing about it. Didn't comp my drink or offer a dessert or tell the manager to come over to address a pissed-off customer.  Nothing. It was if none of this had ever happened. It was only a bad dream. God, I wish that was true.

As other reviewers have stated, the sandwiched was overstuffed to the point that I had to eat it with a fork.  I guess Chompies doesn't realize that giant amounts of food pouring over the plates can be terribly off-putting to a non-hog's appetite.

Oh, well, lesson learned. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I stopped here with my 2 daughters.  We bought 3 cookies and 2 sodas ($10). After the purchase,  we saw that our normal tables near the register were extremely dirty and we sat in the other section.  It wasn't 30 seconds before we were rudely asked to leave. Apparently it's only for \"dine in\" customers only. So I said that I just bought food from your restaurant and now I plan to dine in.  This was not acceptable to the waitress and was once again instructed to leave.  One important detail: there are approximately 50 tables,  give or take.  

It was 4:30 and there were people sitting at ONE table.

When I went to the front counter and mentioned what happened,  the lady at the register Re-confirmed to me that it was only for paying for dine in customers.  Having bought food here,  I thought I WAS a paying customer. 

Long story short,  I was practically lectured by this \"waitress\" about how I, a paying customer,  was in the wrong. I was Extremely upset and embarrassed in front of my 2 daughters.  I will NEVER eat  at chompie's again.  I will tell as many people as possible about this experience. Also,  I will never buy your products in grocery stores.  I have been a very regular customer,  and this is simply inexcusable.  

Can't even sit in your restaurant as a paying customer.  That is RIDICULOUS!  You people should be more than ashamed of yourselves."}
{"text":"I've placed a pick-up order twice in the past week for two bagel sandwiches with cream cheese and both times my order has been completely wrong. First time the eggs were undercooked and one sandwich was cut in half and missing cream cheese, so I drove back and had it corrected. Today I order two bagel sandwiches with cream cheese and one bagel doesn't have cream cheese and the other has the wrong kind. I will drive the extra few minutes to the Chompie's on Shea Blvd from now on. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Why? I'd never been to the actual Chompie's before, I'd just purchased my weight in their everything bagel's from my local grocer. And one time, my aunt brought a huge to-go container of Israeli Couscous Salad to a holiday dinner.

When friends decided to meet here for pre-concert nosh, I was hesitant. Can't we go some place with booze? Oh, Chompie's serves booze? ok then. I'll go.

Ambiance:
-not too far slung from your Red Robin/Swanson's diner-esque chain restaurants. 
-hardly any tables on a weekend night

Service:
-our waitress was relatively polite, I hate that they have to wear those lame uniforms that remind me of my days at Applebees. They could use an upgrade.
-food took a little while to come out, especially considering there was no one in there. 

Food:
-disappointed that they stopped selling the Israeli Couscous Salad. In fact, there was little on the menu that I expected at all. No couscous, no quinoa, very little promotion of their bakery/deli items. Lots of traditional chain restaurant foods: sliders, buffalo chicken, burgers, iceberg lettuce salads, etc. 
-I ordered the Greek salad, half size. Amounted to a full large dinner plate (plenty for two meals). No meat will still run you $8.
-FYI: \"gluten free\" menu insert has very little on it, but at least they offer.
-other people in my party ordered sliders and a cheesesteak, which looked pretty yummy. Again, big portions, everyone took home leftovers.
-next time I'll try some of their \"starters\" which more resemble traditional deli items: matzo balls, mini potato pancakes, knish, and a pastrami on rye.

I'm not sure I'd make it a point to stop by Chompie's unless I was really hankering for a good pastrami. Which isn't out of the question."}
{"text":"Chompie's is one of those places you know is gonna meet a craving i.e. Matzo Ball soup - yes I have Matzo Ball soup cravings, theirs is a chicken noodle Matzo Ball combo and its a well known fact chicken soup feeds the soul. Add a Matzo Ball and your belly is full too!  Their Bagels are   really good, but for the carbs, which I try to cut back on as much as possible without loosing my mind.  So, when I crave a bagel or a croissant it's the Cragel for me, love croissants, like bagels, together a cragel is the right carb combo for me. I had a cragel and egg sandwich last week, very satisfying.  I used to love the sweets but since I am more selective with treats due to my constant risk of a burgeoning girth, I have found that they are not worth it anymore though they LOOK  Gorgeous they taste kinda bland, old, dry, and stale, The chocolate babka is still very good but I don't ever really crave it. Love the new location at the Arrowhead mall, clean, bright, good service, only place i would really eat in the mall when in need of a quick bite."}
{"text":"I just tried to order a hot Pastrami sandwich on a french roll and they asked for $14!!--- wow!--- and it wasn't anything to write home about--

I arrived just before noon to avoid the lunchtime rush...and service was VERY slow and non-chalant-- took inside of 10 minutes before I got my sandwich-- I can't imagine what the lunch crowd has to go through!

I usually go to Chompies for breakfast....which is great--- lunch was a disappointment"}
{"text":"After Village Inn decided to close early on Christmas, a Christmas miracle was provided by Chompies.  We enjoyed a homemade, delicious, multi course holiday dinner including dessert.  Flavorful, homemade chicken matzo ball soup, homemade brine pickles, moist white meat turkey, dressing, two choices of vegetables and dessert. Service was cordial, fast and friendly. The atmosphere was lively and welcoming.  We will be back Chompies."}
{"text":"I'm a big Chompie's fan. I eat at their Tempe, and Shea location on the occasion and am usually very content with the food. 

Chompie's is true to the authentic New Yorker. I, personally, never lived in New York, but my sister and brother-in-law lived there for over 10 years and say that Chompie's hold true to the mentality and tradition.

Their matzo ball soup is delicious. I love their Brooklyner, and the Club. Their breakfast skillets are top-notch, and they have courteous servers.

This most recent trip I went in and had an odd request. My jaw is currently fractured and I can't chew. I asked if they could blend my matzo ball chicken noodle soup and bring it out to me. The waitress was so helpful and told me it wouldn't be a problem. When they brought it out it was all liquified, and it was WONDERFUL! It still had all the flavors of the soup, and the puree that I had in front of me was perfect for my jaw. I was so appreciative that they would take the time to do that for me while I can't chew right now. And to the waitress it was so nonchalant, I never felt like I was imposing that request on her. I am definitely a fan!

When you go, make sure to check out their bread items (bagels), and the HUGE assortment of sweets. They have a great collection of cookies, tarts, cakes, all for sale - and they're really good too!"}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience last week with a server named Jonathan here. He showed up to our table after ten minutes reeking of marijuana took our order while making rude and condescending remarks. It was my first time at a chompies so I wasn't familiar with the menu but didn't expect to be mocked over it. He dropped off our order but it was cold and not prepared the way we had asked. I would have told him but he didn't come back to our table for thirty minutes. Instead he was off at the bar talking. He finally dropped off our check and that was the end of it. 

I emailed chompies because I was seriously disappointed and more than a week has passed without being contacted. My family will never dine with chompies again and I'll be sure to share that they are perfectly fine with their staff using drugs inside their restaurants."}
{"text":"Chompies is awesome. I usually get the turkey sliders as they a ridiculously good. I got the all you can eat fish fry this past Friday (Friday special) and it was great. The fish fillets are thick and flakey. The batter is perfect. Great coleslaw. Always amazing."}
{"text":"As always, an amazing experience at Chompie's Deli. I love all of their food! The atmosphere is a bit \"dated\" but as long as that doesn't bug you, you'll really enjoy this place. Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"I had a very enjoyable experience at Chompies. My server, Sarah, was very helpful and attentive and everything I ordered was brought in a timely manner. Excellent service in fact. I had the half sandwich and soup. Sandwich being pastrami, and soup being chicken kerplach.

One issue I had was with the temperature. The soup was hot. I mean molten lava hot. And my sandwich was warm. That temperature for the sandwich on it's own probably would not have given me pause, but contrasted against the extreme heat of my soup, made it less desirable. Make those sandys hotter, Chompies, and I will have nothing to complain about.

Definitely want to come back for the all you can eat sliders, they looked awesome!"}
{"text":"All I can say is how nice it is to have a true deli restaurant so close to home when I'm so far away from home (Chicago).  Whether you're in the mood for breakfast (served ALL DAY), lunch (sandwiches) or dinner (entrees), Chompie's has the best breakfasts, best sandwiches (the corned beef sandwich will give you enough meat to make another 2-3 sandwiches), and best home cooked entrees I've ever eaten at a deli.  Plus, their matzo ball soup is TO DIE FOR!!!  Big, soft balls just like my grandma used to make!"}
{"text":"A NYC guy every so often needsa  corned beef  fix.Im used to great delis in NYC and LA  Chompies is busy and they sure make $ but the food is  below par. The corned beef was so dry and overcooked it crumbles. The rye bread they use has no guts It falls apart as you eat the sandwich and it wasnt fresh today. It has a wonder bread consistency not good crusty chewy rye. The side dishes cole salw etc are sub par. Bottom line is  Az people are not picky or discriminating especially about deli or jewish food so a place  like this can be successful

Corned beef was so salty ( why??)  chewy like it wasnt cooked properly or sub par CB who knows. The staff in tempe is pleaSANT BUT ROAMS AROUND IN GROUPS iT LOOKS LIKE THERES NO ONE IN CHARGE, NO MGR. bACK TO THE CORNED BEEF, THERE WERE END PIECES DRIED OUT STUFFED IN THE SANDWICH. Someone needs to monitor the kitchen here"}
{"text":"For as long as I've lived in Phoenix (my whole life), I never got around to trying Chompie's. Well the day finally came since they opened this one on the west side of town. My friends and I came in for brunch on Sunday and it was packed! We decided to sit at the bar. The bartender was very nice, but seemed a bit scattered. Expected with a new restaurant though. I loved the decor of the restaurant, that might have been one of my favorite things. 

The Drinks: 
Good. We ordered spicy bloody mary's and mimosas. The bloody mary's were spicy as requested. 

The Food: 
Delicious. I am on a diet right now, but ordered the classic breakfast with 2 eggs, turkey sausage, english muffin and fruit. Everything was delicious, but would have been nice to have a little bit more fruit. My friends ordered the All Salmon Half & Half Bagel and a side of corned beef hash. Not being a salmon fan, it didn't look very good to me, but he said it was outstanding. The corned beef hash had a weird texture, but was good. 

After we finished, we popped over to the deli/bakery. OMG. I don't have a big sweet tooth, but everything looked amazing! I am a sucker for cannolis and black and white cookies...They had both! I will be back when I have a sweet tooth!

Overall, we enjoyed the atmosphere, food an drinks. Will return soon!"}
{"text":"After watching Man Vs. Food - Phoenix, I knew I had to try Chompie's. And while I did not partake in the \"Ultimate Slider Challenge\" (12 jewish sliders and union strings in under 30 minutes), I had the Jewish Sliders and they were, for lack of a better word, awesome!

Jewish Sliders = mini challah rolls stuffed with brisket, potato pancake and Jack cheese and served with a side of brown gravy.  ($10.99)

The brisket was juicy, the potato pancake was crisp and tasty and the brown gravy was the perfect dip. Ask for a side of au jus to make it even better. My friend got a side of apple sauce and added it to his slider and said that we were all missing out."}
{"text":"The sliders are awesome and I beat the Chompies challenge!...........not really.  I say this because Tuesday is the day to head over to Chompies and eat your heart to death with all you can eat sliders.  While I didn't eat the dozen sliders and beat the challenge, I did beat the price tag by going the all can eat route.

Back to the real point here, the food.  The sliders were pretty damn close to perfection.  The bread was magically soft, the brisket nicely cooked to a tender and flavorful point that melts in your mouth, the potato pancake was just awesome with a crunch creamy change of pace to the texture and the sauce just dead on, not to much that the sliders were soggy.  Like I said, just about the perfect slider. The western were good also, but stick with the original.

Skip the $40 challenge, head over on Tuesday and gorge yourself to death on Chompies awesome original sliders!"}
{"text":"The menu is huge, but the food is great. For breakfast, I would recommend the Bobka Crunch French Toast. It is amazing. This morning though, I went with the Jewish Sliders and I loved them. I would highly recommend these. The service can get a little slow when they get busy, but they handle it well. The staff is always friendly. Come hungry because the portions are huge."}
{"text":"After posting my review, I received a response from Wendi is Customer Service. \"Shane I am sorry your experience was not up to par today and I do apologize. Thank you for bringing to my attention.\" That's a nice form letter, but still no reason to go back since my specific issue was not addressed. No reason to think the next visit would be any different. Weird."}
{"text":"Ok, so I've only eaten here once, which is why I only gave this place 4 stars.  I was on a drive from Austin to San Jose and met a friend of mine here for breakfast, and wow, what a way to start the home stretch of my long drive!

I had the corned-beef hash skillet and good lord, that's some good corned-beef hash!  Some home-fries, a couple of eggs sunnyside up and a handful of cheese....AWESOME.  Keep in mind, this meal was over a year ago and I remember it vividly :)

If I am ever in Phoenix, I'm heading straight for Chompie's."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was TERRIBLE! Didn't get our drink and got charged for four coffees on our bill that we didn't order. They never checked in on our table so empty waters and no napkins. Afterward we tried getting a coffee cake and were pointed to a register and waited just to find out it was the wrong register and waited for another customer and then the server pointed back to the other register we were ignored at and proceeded to tell us we'd be helped next only to ignore us another 5 minutes. Horrible service and this location used to be great. Wasn't even that busy"}
{"text":"Finally tried the new Chompie's in Chandler. Food was excellent, but service and cleanliness was not.

The bad: When we arrived, it was probably a normal lunch crowd, full but with a handful of open tables. Hostess was really bad - barely acknowledged us and only mumbled. The hostess kept walking away and returning and pretty much refused to make eye contact. Seemed very strange and rude. And we weren't the only ones waiting that were irritated. Took quite a while to be seated. Once we were sat, the table and chairs were filthy. Hostess return to wipe it, but shouldn't have bothered. Eventually got someone else to clean the table off. 

The good: Ordered sliders, a side salad, and the roasted tomato/mushroom/goat cheese salad and they were all delicious and large portions. They also brought us blueberry muffin/cake before our food came and it was delicious too. Manager ended up bringing us some cookies and they were quite yummy too. 

Our waitress was very good and attentive, so hopefully the hostess and the cleanliness issue was a fluke. Will update my review if we return and this changes."}
{"text":"We are from the Midwest and have been here a few times. This is by far the best sandwich place we have been to while in Scottsdale, food is great, always had good service and prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"Friends joined us here for breakfast, but were disappointed with all the sides possible, but not having grits available for their side. I enjoyed my omelet and appreciated having a gluten-free bagel. All of us had plenty of food, coffee and water. Our bill for 2 of us with an Greek omelet, bowl of oatmeal, and 2 OJ's was $32.00, so a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"We went to Chompie's for a holiday meal, and the food was really hit or miss. The matzah ball soup was amazing, but the entrees were lacking. My husband ordered brisket and I ordered salmon. The salmon was overcooked and the brisket was too tough. I've had the stuffed cabbage rolls before and they were also lacking in flavor. Still, their lox and bagels and soups are delicious. The cookies that came with the holiday meal were not good, but the bakery section has some great pastries. I wish I could give 3.5 stars, but we will look for another choice for the holidays."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Chompie's since I was a little girl and they used to be strictly kosher. With all businesses they adapted to change and offer no kosher items. I know being my children here and has become a generation thing. It's nice to see faces that have been around for a long time. The food is great. My only complaint is the restaurant is so tiny there is a longer wait. But I will wait for my lox and matzo ball soup!"}
{"text":"This review is intended for whoever is the owner of Chompies. Came back to give this place a 2nd chance(after a horrible 1st visit). I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon, jalapeño, cheddar, & BBQ sauce. My total was just under $15. In a state where minimum wage is $8.05, how do you think you can get away with charging $15 for a burger that looked & tasted awful, Ruby Tuesday's in the late 80's served a better burger. Bland burger & soggy bun, I wouldn't have fed this to my dog. Anyone giving this restaurant a good rating or review seriously doesn't know what good food is. Please don't contact me, I want nothing from this company. Oh yeah it made me poop 4 times the following morning."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Chompies near ASU on 3/10/17 for beakfast and had visited them a few times prior.  Each time the experience was just average as was the food. I was first introduced to Chompies when my employer (government municipality) had breakfast catered by them. The catered breakfast was absolutely delicious. It included waffles, eggs, bacon, homefries and bagels. However, whenever I have visited the restaurant after and ordered the same breakfast items the taste and quality just did not measure up. Today I decided to order an omelette instead. It was the worst omelette I've ever had. It was very bland and lukewarm as was my wife's food. And the salsa they served with was just awful. I have had way better omelettes at IHOP.  I just decided to eat it and made up my mind that I was giving up on Chompies after that. They are completely overrated. On another tip the manager that was walking around the restaurant with the baseball cap and curly hair just did not present as being very hygienic.  I was disgusted when I saw him outside in the back smoking a cigarette and then moments later walking around the restaurant serving water and reeking of cigarette smoke."}
{"text":"Our first visit last year we had a very poor experience, with bland and cold food. Today however everything was fantastic. All our food was fresh hot and delicious. The starter tapas are amazing. The soup was great and the pastrami sandwich was awesome. Our server Jennifer was just as good and very helpful, she turned us on to the tapas. We will be back soon! All the desserts we took home were great as well. The only thing we don't care for is the sweetness of the potato salad."}
{"text":"Although I think on some level the atmosphere (how many Jewish delis are there in the Phoenix area?) and mammoth proportions somewhat overshadow how good the food at Chompie's actually is, at the end of the day this is a solid restaurant with good food.

I have only been to this location one or two other times prior to this last visit (and it/they were both a LONG time ago), but I have been to the Tempe one from time to time when I'm in town for a visit & despite the different layouts (for some reason this one \"feels\" more like a Jewish deli), the food & service at both locations are similar.

I don't like pickles at all, but it's nice that they put them out at your table like some restaurants do w/bread, chips/salsa, etc...

The menu here is HUGE and breakfast is served all day, which I like. Last time I was here I had a chorizo & cheese omelet, and it came w/home fries (I think I could have substituted them for fruit or cottage cheese, but I was on vacation) and a bialy (can substitute w/bagel, English muffin, or toast). This was a TON of food. The omelet & homes fries were a bit greasy, but hey, they were good. I do LOVE that Chompie's serves bialies! 

The service here can be a bit slow, but nothing TOO much worth complaining about. At the end of the day Chompie's is a solid spot."}
{"text":"Finally made it Chompie's after passing by it many times for work!

On service alone, I would give it 1 star for the waitress last night that kept looking at us but never came over until 5 minutes after we sat down. She barely even acknowledged us.

On to the food: about 3-3.5 stars. The husband and I got the Western sliders and the Jewish sliders. I really liked the Jewish sliders, although it is a very greasy / heavy meal. He really liked the Western sliders. According to him, the Tempe location is a lot nicer looking and has better service. I can't see myself craving Chompie's, but if I ever do, I'll be sure to go to Tempe."}
{"text":"I eat at Chompies almost every weekend and I love it! The food is always fresh and delicious! The service is quick, efficient and friendly. I especially recommend Tammy, Phyllis, Mo, Shea or Ashley to serve you. You may even be lucky enough to meet the owner Lovey who greets each table when she's there. This place is a local favorite."}
{"text":"I was out with my colleague who has seen the episode of Man Vs Food that featured the Jewish Sliders, and we just had to come by. I mean, we seriously went out of our way to visit. We road the BUS, OMG. I'm still astonished that we were able to find our way around using surface public transportation, but that's besides the point. 

Chompie's is ok. Everything looks amazing, and sounds amazing, and it's one of those deals where you cannot come in here when you're hungry or else you'll order way too much because the menu reads like a best of list of comfort foods. Anyway, I was torn between the Pastrami and the Jewish Sliders. Our waitress, Jess, couldn't help since apparently those are a couple of the best and most popular dishes. It would be like comparing Michael Jordan and Lance Armstrong. They're both amazing, it's just a matter of narrowing your meal criteria. I ended up with the Jewish Sliders since brisket, cheese, and a potato cake, all drenched in gravy just sounded too good, and unique to pass up. First thing I did upon receiving the plate was to get more gravy. There is no such thing as too much gravy. I went to to submerge sections of the sliders and slowly enjoy each bite. Remarkable mixture of flavors and the gravy makes a huge difference. Here's the problem though, the brisket was a little dry and tasteless. Without the cheese and gravy, the sliders would have been a miss. All together with the extra gravy however, they were good. I did go on to mention this detail to Jess when she came to check on us. I felt like the manager or whoever keeps track of customer comments would probably want to know that the brisket was dry? Well when Jess came back with the check, she surprised me with half of a pastrami sandwich! OMG, this made my week! I suppose she wanted to make sure that I left on a good note and through this small gesture, I most certainly did. I haven't tried the pastrami yet, but Jess promised that it would be everything I hoped for. I believe her. 

Also had a thick delectable chocolate milkshake that nearly sent me into a food coma from all the syrup, whipped cream, and of course the cherry on top. 

I like this place a lot. It also doesn't hurt that they treat their customers right and really listen to feedback. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I just finished giving a presentation and kind of skipped my early morning breakfast. So, I came here for brunch around 10:30 am. I was seated very fast, actually, before I could take my seat some guy said 'excuse me' and left some pickles and a glass of water. Aside from the fact that it was quasi-rude to put something down on the table while I was sitting, from behind me, I thought it was cool that I already had my water and I could try a couple of pickles.

What a big menu. I'm eating on a budget, and for breakfast they seemed to have just a ridiculous amount of options, pretty much anything that's homestyle American was on the menu. I had a peek at the lunch menu too, but I was really only here for the $5.99 'Eggciting' special. They also have just a bagel, cream cheese, and coffee for $2.99, which seems like a decent deal. The waitress quickly took my order, scrambled eggs, jalapeno bagel, cream cheese, home fries, and turkey sausage.

Hold up. Turkey sausage. Really? Yes, really. This is actually what tipped me off to visiting this place. I love a classic American breakfast, but I hesitate to go to places like Denny's, IHOP, and even Mimi's because I always get ripped off because I don't eat pork. I usually have to substitute at these places which kind of destroys the whole classic American breakfast feeling. 

Food came out surprisingly fast. It wasn't piping hot like I like it, but it wasn't cold either. I don't remember asking for my bagel to be toasted, but then again I don't remember requesting not toasted either. I'm not that picky on that. The home fries weren't hot either which was a disappointment, because I know potatoes hold their heat very well. Anyways, aside from the warm, not hot, food it tasted pretty good. Eggs were done just to my liking. The turkey sausage was fantastic and had a perfect texture. There are two types of turkey sausage, the smoked sauage that comes in a long link (hot dog texture) and the shorter links with a more ground beef texture (and also apparently patties like they had here). It was seasoned well, cooked well, and the texture was just perfect. The home fries were good and also had a nice texture, there was some crispiness to it, but at the end all I really had left was extra crispy chips.

Given my experience, I can only do a 3-star. I was really excited to try this place out and I'm certain that if my food was a little bit hotter it would be my favorite breakfast place. Its a shame it wasn't hot because I'd really like to come back here and try other breakfast items, they have a really interesting sounding chicken fajita omelette.

Also, I feel that its worth mentioning that the pricing here is very diverse. There is stuff from $5 all the way up to like $15 per person. Check menu before you go."}
{"text":"I've just found the perfect slider for me- the turkey slider! It's like a Thanksgiving meal, with white meat turkey, cranberry sauce, and turkey gravy. Every ingredient in this meal is something I love! The challah rolls are perfect, and the potato pancake adds a nice crunch to the slider. I was slightly disappointed that the jellied cranberry sauce looked and tasted like it came straight from a can, but that was a minor setback.

I also tried some of the pot roast sandwich. It was a massive meal, with huge slices of meaty pot roast with good flavor. 

I've also tried their bakery items, which are quite good. The cookies and cakes are, for the most part, really delicious. My favorite so far is the mouse cake. I've tried other cute looking mini-cakes, like the frog cake, but the frosting on it tastes a bit strange to me, and there's not enough of the \"cake\" part in it to balance out the massive amount of frosting.

They are also open an hour later now- very nice! (Until 9 P.M.)"}
{"text":"Friendly cheerful service despite being crazy busy on a Friday night.  I had the all-you-can eat fish and chips.  The fish batter was light and crispy, not too greasy, and the fish was tender and flavorful inside.  I did get a large bone in one of the pieces of fish I ate though : (  The fries were nice and crispy, and the coleslaw very flavorful. 

This is generally a 4 star quality restaurant for me, but minus 1 star for finding a bone in my meal."}
{"text":"The burgers here are delicious. The price is relatively good. They have a bakery with some amazing treats. The environment inside is nice and they have TVs with sports playing usually. They give you free pickles and bread while you wait. The service is decent."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. Server was great. Food good. We each had a salad and soup. Appears to be home made soup. Very good. Little noisey and pricey. Would most likely give it another try"}
{"text":"Second time I've picked up from there and my order was gross. I always ask for the same thing and it was so thick and fatty for the second time. I should have learned the first time as my sandwich became the most expensive dog food ever. Very disappointing and I spent so much money"}
{"text":"Awesome food for a pretty good price. A cool New York deli style sit down where they bring you a plate of different pickles while you wait for you food. The bagels are good, however I'd rather go for their \"Jewish Sliders;\" they are amazing!"}
{"text":"Chompie's is a well known, NY style restaurant & bakery, so I'm not breaking any new ground here... but as an ex-New Yorker living in Southern California, it was a natural for me to want to try it while on vacation with my family in Scottsdale, AZ.

We stopped off twice during the week... once for lunch and a second time for breakast before driving out of town  (because we liked it so much).  

LUNCH:
First off I have to compliment them on having HALF-SOUR PICKLES on the tables.  I miss this from delis back in NY.  It's hard to find them on the west coast.  For lunch my wife ordered their famous sliders (yes, the ones on the Man vs. Food challenge) although she only ate one of them.  They were very tasty though.  I had the Pastrami Reuben which I liked very much.  My mother-in-law had some Matzah ball soup... to be honest I didn't care for that very much... (and yes, I grew up with it and know good matzah ball soup). My daughter had the sauteed perogies which were very good too.  My sons had burgers.... they liked them, but then again, they're just burgers.  We also had a side of onion straws which were OK.  Overall the food was good though.

We also picked up some bagels, knishes and italian pastries for the hotel room since we were going to be there all week.  The deli counter looked fantastic: more pickles, cream cheese spreads, fish (salmon & whitefish) and salads.... as well has hebrew national salamis.  I felt like I was almost back in NY.  The bagels were good...but then again, after spending the past 8 years out of New York... any bagel had to be better then what I get in California.  I had a potato & onion knish later that night... it was awesome.  Just like in a new york kosher deli.

BREAKFAST:
We came back on Saturday morning for breakfast.  breakfast sliders, bagels & lox, pancakes, etc.  All were very good.  My \"All Salmon\" bagel (with cream cheese, lox & nova, capers, onions & tomato) hit the spot.  Very good. 

My ONLY complaint is that we sat in the back room.  It had an awesome mural on the wall of some of the great New York Yankees (which I LOVED) ... From right to left was Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Reggie Jackson and Don Mattingly.....  My complaint?  Where's JOE DiMAGGIO??  Really?  Ok.  A very minor gripe from a true Yankee fan. :)

Man Vs. Food:  
Adam Richman was here for the \"Ultimate Slider Challenge\".  He didn't win.  But there is a small wall towards the back of the restaurant which is the \"Wall of Fame\".  I took a pic of my youngest son there as he LOVES that show and always thinks that HE can win the challenge.  Maybe someday.... but there was no way he was going to eat all those sliders. 

Bottom line?  Chompies is a must stop in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Went in on Friday for lunch. I ordered by phone for pickup     The ladies behind the counter were moderately friendly but I guess... I order the LaJolla salad, a piece of carrot cake and a drink, it came out to a whopping $19 bucks! They are really feeling themselves. The salad was pretty good, the cake sucked and the drink was well a drink. In all, I may come back but not unless someone else is paying."}
{"text":"The year: 2010.
  
The episode: \"Phoenix.\"

The Man: Adam Richman, himself.

The Challenge: Chompie's \"The Ultimate Slider Challenge.\"

...12 Original Jewish Sliders: each one brisket-filled and gravy-drizzled, stacked as well with mini potato pancakes, Jack cheese, and onion strings.  Knock this 5-pound nemesis on its ass within 30 short minutes, and you rule the stoop, my friend!  Myself, I don't entertain delusions: I'm weak.  I didn't even consider the Challenge.  Instead, I ordered the Combo.  And after tearing through an incredibly tasty two, alongside a cup of Matzo Ball soup, I was full.  Adam, however, he Manned-up!  Sadly, though, after a hard-fought battle, he--as many have before him--ultimately threw in the towel. The Challenge, it seemed, proved too hefty.  Food had won.

...However, if one, brave soul decides to accept this heaping challenge ($39.95) and conquers this plattered beast, it's free.  But not only that: upon winning, you will be forever immortalized on Chompie's \"Hall of Fame\" website (http://chompies.com/wall-of-fame/) and an \"Ultimate Slider Challenge\" T-shirt awaits you and your bragging self!! You bad!!  (By the way, there's no California representation on that website, zero, none, not one, nada...  Who'll step up?

This having been my first time to Chompie's, I was truly impressed!  A Yelp check-in offer allowed for a free bagel from their awesome deli/bakery; our very cool server, Trudy, brought out a few, free cookie samples for this first-timer; and our just-as-cool host made lunch suggestions, which we ordered verbatim.  As promised, those Sliders were \"deli-icious.\"  And the Matzo Ball and Chicken soup hit the spot.  But I couldn't leave...not yet.  As full as I was, I couldn't head back to CA without first trying the carrot cake, could I?  I mean, you don't blame me, right?

So, \"Man vs Food\"...  That takes care of Phoenix: Alice Cooper'stown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/alice-cooperstown-phoenix?hrid=esDZwjuGZQlkpKrZAC_guQ), Los Reyes de la Torta (http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-reyes-de-la-torta-phoenix-2?hrid=nJiqRCfTtxs2bIoFrPdmkA), and now Chompie's.  On deck, LA.

{"text":"What a treasure!!!! I'm from Austin and have been craving a Reuben ever since Katz's closed. The Reuben was amazing!!!! The chicken and matza ball soup was so yummy. Our waitress was super sweet and attentive. I must say I'm so please that this was my last meal before heading back to Texas!

I also grabbed so goodies from their fabulous bakery to take home!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to chompies 2x before and remember the food being decent. So this past Friday after running errands with the family, we decide to try chompies. 

It was pretty empty inside. A guy comes and delivers water and then we wait. And wait. And wait. Finally about 10 minutes later our waitress comes by with straws and asks if we're ready to order. 

J's order - Monte Cristo 
C's order - a kids slider
Mine - buffalo chicken sandwich
App - Holy Pierogi

Now never having pierogis before, i can't say if these were good or not. But first impression, not ordering again.  Pretty much bland mashed potatoes in a dumping.

The Monte Cristo was greasy and very cloying. No balance of sweet and savory. Like ordering diabetes for dinner. J ended up only eating half of a half and was done. The manager did replace it with a hot pastrami, which J said was excellent and he should have ordered originally.

The kids slider - the waitress didn't ask what type of slider and C was automatically given the Jewish slider. He ate the slice of brisket off the slider and the fries. 

My buffalo chicken sandwich. Not as described on the menu. A piece of grilled chicken, not fried, so huge that it was 2x the size of the bun. The chicken must have had sauce dumped over it because it was so sopping wet the bottom bun disintegrated into a mushy mess before I even took a bite. And the blue cheese was missing. I ended up eating a few bites and had had enough. 

Service at the table was lack luster. Took 20 minutes to get the check. And the manager seemed irritated that we didn't like the food. 

Oh and apparently dinner time is the perfect time for doing maintenance in the restroom. Going to take C to the potty, i had to ask the 2 workers to leave. Then returning later to use the facilities myself, i again had to ask them to leave. So forget trying to wash your hands properly. Unless i wanted to hopscotch over the materials/supplies.

I will say the counter/bakery guy was outstanding. His customer service - A+
Counter purchases - 
Cheesecake - Fabulous. Nice texture and not overly sweet
Alligator - Fantastic. If a bear claw and baklava had a baby, it would be an alligator!"}
{"text":"Good service. Good food. Average Dessert 

Philly cheesesteak was good, it was just needed  more salt.

Jewish sliders are the best ! 

Eclair was a okay but it was a little hard and the cream was not as sweet as I hoped."}
{"text":"Food is always great but the service was horrible.  We sat outside because the weather was perfect but it took about 10 minutes before anyone came to our table. There was people sitting all around us but we were just ignored. Next time I want Chompie's I will be going to location in Tempe!"}
{"text":"This place was nice when we walked in.  The menu looks good and the food too we shall see what it tastes like currently awaiting our order just my daughters is here lol OK BRB;)"}
{"text":"We revisited last night and had great dinner. Our server \"The Jey\" did an outstanding job taking care of us. The manager took time to come over and chat with us, we want to thank her. Also, thank Mitch and Wendi. Their soup is the best we have ever had. Sandwiches are very feeling, so you never leave hungry."}
{"text":"Soggy, way, way, OVERPRICED cannoli. It was inedible. I wonder how long it was sitting in the case. The bakery prices here are uncalled for. I wasn't impressed the last time I came, but this time was my last. I feel ashamed for throwing my money away."}
{"text":"Best bagels! I like a lot of cream cheese but chompies has a heavy hand, ask for less! The service has gotten much nicer over the years.."}
{"text":"The best bagels in Phoenix. real NEW YORK Authentic. Great bakery items too. We always get a huge assortment for New years and stay home where it's safe."}
{"text":"Hands down the best service I have ever received not once or twice but every time I come here! Jey is such a stand out server who definitely knows what he's doing in the service world. I would be willing to spend my last dollar just to come for the service! Thank you to everyone at the Chompie's crew in Chandler!!"}
{"text":"We normally like this place and their food but we had a bad experience tonight. I understand that places get busy and you have to wait for a table but once you sit down you shouldn't have to wait to get greeted or served. We had enough once the people at the next table get their even though they sat down about ten minutes after we did. When we brought that to the attention of the waiter he just made an excuse and ran off to hid in the kitchen. He was not trained very well and did not have a very good attitude for that kind of work. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"I go here for one reason and one reason only...Hot Pastrami !!  Being a transplant NY'er I just get the craving and Chompie's has never dissapointed me!  Maybe I will order something else in the future, but probably not...."}
{"text":"A favorite place to go when I'm craving breakfast for dinner. The latkes are tasty (not as good as mom's but...you know) and the service is always friendly and helpful. I always grab some baked goods to go (rugelach!!)."}
{"text":"I had the Jewish Sliders! It was great and the service was fast and friendly! A+ visit for sure!"}
{"text":"Chompie's Deli puts me in a New York State of Mind. It is a New York Deli in Phoenix's Paradise Valley Mall that gives New York delis in New York City a run for their money.

  My brother and I came across Chompie's Deli after walking out of a nearby restaurant that gave a mediocre first impression. As soon as we walked in the door of Chompie's Deli, we had a confident first impression. A 15-minute wait persuaded us that we were in for a wonderful dining experience.

  A fifteen minute wait at Chompie's is time well used. Their menu is enormous, leaving several difficult choices to make.

  In my situation, when it was time to order, the choices were simple. I ordered two New York Kosher deli icons that I grew up to love in New York and have been having difficulty finding in Las Vegas. They were a knish and kasha Varnishkas. The size of a Chompie's knish is of higher rank than any that I tasted in New York. By the time I finished the potato knish and kasha varnishkas, it dawned on me how much I miss the New York Kosher Deli food.

  In similar fashion to their knish, Chompie's is a large restaurant. It has the same foot print of a T.G.I Friday's with both an entrance from inside and separate from the Paradise Valley Mall.

  Chompie's Deli is more than eating out. They also have a thriving take out business. My brother took out chocolate covered rainbow cookies. Like the Twinkies, chocolate covered rainbow cookies are scarce. Instead of paying $1,000 for a Twinkie on EBay, you can buy something in the ballpark of eight chocolate covered rainbow cookies for nearly $10 in Chompie's. And, near the take out counter there is interesting newspaper clippings that tell the story of Chompie's growth.

 Regardless of how well Chompie's excels at their New York Deli business, I offer some constructive criticism. Disparate from the New York Kosher delis that I have dined in, complimentary pickles and cole slaw are nonexistent here.  Then again, this tradition could have changed since the last time I visited New York five years ago.

  I am pleased that my brother and I found Chompie's Deli. Now if a serious urge for a potato knish and kasha varnishkas hits me, instead of boarding an airplane for New York, I can drive around 250 miles to Phoenix."}
{"text":"A true New York style deli right here in Scottsdale, Arizona!  A variety of dishes makes it hard to decide.   We got the lox and bagels, and the corned beef hash dish with eggs over easy.  Good food, great service!  Don't leave without getting some bagels and bakery items to go.  Wednesdays they have a special buy 12 get 6 free!"}
{"text":"I called recently to place a to go order for my work company and I happened to call 5 minutes before opening and they answered and told me to call back when you open. Either don't answer the phone  or provide good customer service and take my order, it was only 5 minutes before opening. Respect lost."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first dining experience at Chompies Arrowhead. The staff was exceptionally attentive. We also had the honor of meeting one of the owners, which made the experience all the more valuable. To hear the love the Chompies family has shared with Arizona for so many years is inspiring and humbling. They offer both catering and in-restaurant dining across the valley. We were able to try out a few of their specialties tonight- the Original Jewish slider (lean brisket with potato pancake on challah bread), the Grandpa Rubys, along with salad and dessert- my favorite is the rainbow and chocolate layered cake.. flavored like almond and rather decadent.. yet cut small enough to not feel guilty. The bagel and pastry selection is incredible. I've only purchased their bakery goods prior to tonight's meal, but I very much look forward to coming back and trying more options in the near future."}
{"text":"This place is a must if you are in the Paradise Valley area. It's one of our favorite deli/resturants.  We went to have breakfast here this past weekend.  We walked in and went over to the hostess stration.  Imediately we were greated by a woman with so much energy.  She welcomed us and was so very curtious.  Once we sat down, our server was quick to take our drink orders.  She was very pleasant and had a fun attitude.  We've been here a few times, so we know what we like.  I had the Breakfast Taco's.  They are SO yummy and if you're interested they are on the Glutten Free part of the menu (which I think is a great plus to have this available). 
As always, this location never fails on service or food flavor."}
{"text":"I have to agree with this other reviewers and I wonder if the success of Chompie's may have taken on more than they could handle? I think the food is pretty good, really I think the bagels are probably the stars. But like the others, I felt like we waited an awfully long time to get our meal and the waitress never came to check on us once. I would have liked another cup of coffee but she wasn't even the one who brought our food. I really think that the place seems like it is chaotic and just has way too much going on at one time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to buy low carb bread! It also has some excellent dinner options like liver and onions! I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"BOGO Burgers  for lunch- can't go wrong with this deal! The burgers are huge and char cooked to order! Their Bourbon Burger with crispy onion strings, jack cheese, and tangy bourbon sauce is smokin'! I wanted something sweet as Chompie's is one of my favorite bakeries in Phoenix, but lunch was sooo good and beyond filling I couldn't even decide on a tasty treat for later! Next time I will get dessert first!"}
{"text":"This was a good place to eat.  When we walked in we were surprised at all the luscious looking bakery items.  We were too full when we left to consider them though.

The menu was packed with choices and prices were fairly good.  Our server was excellent.  Breakfast is served all day and two of our group ordered pancakes/waffles with strawberries.  Breakfast was good but they were surprised at how few strawberries were there.

The turkey plate was good.  There was a lot of food on it and again, no complaints.  Another person at the table ordered the sliders.  He said they were good but not quite as good as he hoped.

Nothing really stuck out as exceptional but it was good and we would return if in the area."}
{"text":"I loved Chompies when I lived in Tempe, but the Chandler location doesn't seem to serve the same quality with the same attitude.

The service is impersonal. The food is sub-par, from limp bacon to undercooked eggs. I also don't understand the $7.50 price tag for a single Belgian waffle. It wasn't particularly big or tasty. 

I'll still keep coming for the sliders and the bakery, but I hope this location someday can match the quality of the Tempe Chompies."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast!  We only waited 10-15 min in the packed restaurant.  The staff was very nice and out service was great!  

Loved the Buffalo Eggs Benedict- they used their bagels instead of English muffins. I tried the Chorizo omelet and it was spicy and delicious.  I would go definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Good solid Jewish Deli, especially for Phoenix.

I really like the matzo ball soup and feel any visit is incomplete without ordering it.  The stuffed cabbage, though I frequently order it, I shouldn't.  The sandwiches are overstuffed and delicious in my experience.

On an odd side note, they make a pretty decent hot dog as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!!! I've only had breakfast here, but I've had their bagels, cream cheese and a few pastries. Their bagels are top notch. Whenever my sister and mom visit from Tucson, we come to Chompie's and they stock up on dozens of bagels to last them until the next time they come up. 

Since we ordered before 11am on a weekday, I got my breakfast (2 eggs, bacon and two huge pancakes) for $3.99. I checked the receipt and asked the waitress if that price was right because I couldn't fathom all that for $3.99.

I can't really speak for some of the other reviews as far as wait times, etc, because yesterday when we went for breakfast (about 10:45) we had good service, and right as we were leaving (probably 11:30 or so) it had gotten SO busy, it was so crowded we could barely get out the door. But that just tells me that everyone loves this place, I don't know why the overall rating for Chompie's is only a 3!"}
{"text":"Our server Nidia was absolutely fabulous!  She's friendly, efficient, knowledgeable and just all around great.  The portion sizes here are ridiculously large!  The food today was generally good but one bagel was hard as a rock, which was disappointing.  The other reason this is a four review rather than a five is because the air vent above us was crazy cold and very forceful.  It would lessen at times but then come back to the point that it was just uncomfortable.  Otherwise great experience."}
{"text":"I'm still angry that they moved further away from me and now that they are in the mall it's too crowded.  Aside from this, I do like chompies' bagels and cookies.  Actually, I love their cookies.  They are soooo yummy.  If you are in the mall and just want dessert, order some cookies and take them out somewhere to sit in the mall.  I don't have patience to sit in a overly crowded mall resteraunt so they lost my sit down and eat business with their location change."}
{"text":"Christmas Day was my first time at Chompies. Tried the Nova Tapas, so good! It's a large portion so be prepared. It's easy to spend a lot here so be prepared but the portions are so large you could definitely share.

Being a holiday there was no dip in service. Our waitress was very pleasant and the atmosphere was perfect for a morning meal."}
{"text":"Service was terrible had to call the manager over to get more coffee. The service manager came over gave us coffee didn't apologize poured the coffee and left. Our waiter never came back had to call the service manager over again to get boxes. Then after sitting for 15 minutes had to call the manager over to get the bill. Manager had no customer service skills either no apologies nothing. Won't be going back. Food was ok."}
{"text":"jeez, what's with all the haters on here?  this place is a favorite of ours.  never any issues with service or food."}
{"text":"When I saw a deli-style restaurant that promised good food and quality baked goods, I was sold. The sandwiches are huge, definitely enough to feed you for two meals if you want, and the ingredients were of good quality. While you're waiting, they bring pickles to the table, which is a big plus for me. 

If you're wanting something for your sweet tooth, check out their bakery section. The quality and variety reminded me of several local/family-owned bakeries I used to visit in Chicago.  Definitely a restaurant to check out."}
{"text":"We came here for Passover dinner with friends. The service was very friendly and the waiter went out of his way to accommodate our requests. Portions were enormous and most of the food was quite good. The menu was also reasonably priced. The only negative was that the place was absolutely packed and while we had a reservation, we waited close to 45 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday morning. There was a lot of people in due to the holiday, but it just took us a few minutes to get seated. Our server was nice and attentive. I had an internal dilemma on whether or not to have breakfast or lunch, but I decided on the cajun chicken ecstasy with fries. Our meals came out and they were huge of course. My sandwich was good, but I would have enjoyed it more if a) the bun was as big as the chicken breast or b) the chicken breast was smaller. I made a giant mess and all of the goodness fell out because it was difficult to eat. I've been here before and will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious mouthwatering sandwiches, bagels and cream cheese to die for! I can´t say enough good things about this place. The managers and service are just amazing! The Reuben sandwich is loaded with yummy pastrami! my favorite!"}
{"text":"I am not a big of the wait, but food is solid.  
I can never remember which salmon prep I like best, so I erred last time I came in and ordered the eggs Benedict; which came with the cooked salmon pieces and not the smoked sliced variety.  Shame on me, so not their fault.  I will note that the bagel was not toasted and it impacted the taste.
The house potatoes were cooked perfectly.

Service here is pretty good and coffee is excellent.

There are many varieties of pastries to enjoy both as dine in and take out options.

When in the area will definitely return, but will order a bit more carefully."}
{"text":"I have been a Chompies customer for 30+ years and other than New York have not found bagels I enjoy more. The Arrowhead location lacks a certain atmosphere. It is a toss up if you aren't seated in the mall it's fine. If you are seated in the low rent mall section you get to deal with smelly homeless people coming up and staring at you, and kids screaming and  leaning on the little \"fence\" meant to separate you from the mall. The food is fabulous but the gluten free options (yes some people have celiac and aren't just being trendy)are way too pricey. More expensive than Portland Oregon prices. Won't be back to this location,  I will visit the freestanding locations."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 4.5/5
Happiness - 3/5

Chompie's - for good and bad - is very much a New York style place. The food is very good - some of the best deli sandwiches I have had outside of New York. I personally recommend the brisket, corned beef, and my personal favorite - tongue. They have an incredibly breakfast spread too - bagels, bialys and various types of fish (sturgeon and whitefish in addition to lox). They also are a bit adventurous in the menu department. For example, I tried deep fried matzah balls on my last visit - something I've never seen anywhere else (tasted a lot like tater tots). They also have a host of delicious egg-white omelets if you don't feel like busting your day's calories on the otherwise heavy fare. 

But as is usual in New York, the service is often poor. The waitress at my last meal was particularly good, but that is not the norm. Typically, the wait staff seem to know very little about the menu (usually unable to answer any questions), don't tell you about the specials, and only swing by the table once in a blue moon. I always budget plenty of time to account for the slow service that is typical there. 

They have a giant case of pastries, but I'd advise skipping it. Though the sandwiches and breakfast fare are VERY delicious, I've always found the pastries overly sweet and uninspired. Definitely not worth the calories."}
{"text":"Coming from NYC, Chompies is the closest I can get to good Deli here in AZ. Normally we go to the Scottsdale location which I will say is considerably better than the Chandler location. The Chandler location appears old, dated, dirty and not to mention service slow. It took a bit of time for the server to even come to our table with menus and then take our order. I think we were the forgotten child while waiting and waiting for our food, while it seemed other tables were getting their food before us even after they sat after us.

Missing my craving for Chopped liver, I ordered the appetizer portion that came with Bagel Chips and a slice of Onion. My friend ordered the Pastrami on Rye which was good, though the sandwich size was not piled high like the Scottsdale location serves. My Chopped Liver was a little too sweet for my taste which I never had that in the Scottsdale either.

Chandler location, service slow, kitchen slow, food OK, atmosphere: old, and dirty. Go to the Scottsdale location, I'm a 4 Star fan there!"}
{"text":"We came to this location for a weekday lunch, busy, busy, busy but the turnover is fast and we were seated without waiting to long. Coming from New York City, we miss good deli. We ordered the Mile High Pastrami Sandwich on rye with french fries and the Chopped Liver appetizers served with sliced onion and bagel chips. Both were excellent! The only thing that we felt was weak were the 2 plates of pickles which were straggly looking.

I will also comment that the deli, bagel, and bakery goods area of this Shea location is much nicer and fresher looking than the Tempe and Chandler locations, now that I have bought and tasted from all 3. This location by far is the best food quality location.

Chompies is the best New York style deli in Arizona, hands down."}
{"text":"We went to Chompie's for dinner last night...

I have been going to Chompies for many years, ever since they were just bagels and coffee down on 32nd St/Shea.  

I have noticed a decline in the quality of the meats over the last few years.  :(

I had a 1/2 hot Pastrami on rye w/ fries and a small bowl of chicken noodle soup.  The soup was as good as ever, flavorful and just the right temperature to enjoy it.  The fries were as good as ever.  The Pastrami?  Not so much.  The sandwich looked wonderful, and just \"like it used to be\"; but one bite told me everything I needed to know.  It was like chewing a mouthful of rubber bands!  Very fatty meat and very disappointing.

My wife had the Jewish Sliders w/ a cup of soup and cole slaw nosh.  Her sliders were very tasty(loved the mini challah rolls!).  She had a beef/mushroom soup that she said was excellent.

Junior had the kid's cheeseburger and fries.  It was at least a 1/4 pound and he was happy!  

The pickle \"nosh\" is still great, love the different varieties, but miss the green tomatoes.

Our server was Kelly S.  She was everything a good server should be; friendly, attentive and always handy w/ the drink refills.  We will ask for her section next time we go back.

Due to the dismal quality of the Pastrami; I can't give more than 3 stars.  Cut rate Pastrami in a Jewish deli just doesn't make it for me.  I may have to take a break from them for a while, or just go for breakfast or a nice big bowl of chicken noodle soup."}
{"text":"Have always loved the Chompies in PV and was happy to see the new location in Arrowhead.  I do see a decline in the food quality and had a very unpleasant experience with last visit.  We got a two for one coupon through email and went to have late lunch.  We waited a long time before anyone came to table.  The server, Andria, was busy socializing with the table next door.  Then she came over with an attitude.  We had to remind her 10 minutes later that she had promised pickles.  She did not bring the usual order and seemed perturbed  but we didn't say anything.  I ordered a substitute for fries and she brought me a horrible potato salad that was like mashed potatoes with onion.  I asked her to return it because I did not like it.  Her reply was.,\"it's your right not to like it,\" with no offer of a replacement.  She pretty much ignored us and we had to wait forever for the tab.  Then we discovered she had charged us full price even though we had showed her our coupon on app at the beginning. We spoke with the manager who gave us a refund for the difference but all this took an extra 30 minutes out of our schedule.  We did bring home some deli sweets which were very good.  It's just disappointing that such a great restaurant has so many issues with their service and quality."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for breakfast only and each time I have had a good experience.  

The wait can get long on weekends so plan accordingly.  I usually have the breakfast of champions which is 2 eggs, choice of bacon or sausage, and 2 pancakes.   The pancakes are pretty good.  

The decor is sort set up in a NY style deli/restaurant. I hear they have good bagels but I've never tried one. 

Service is always good and the staff always friendly.   
I haven't been exactly blown away by anything but I have no complaints. I'll come back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We love Chompie's! We have a holiday party every year at this location. We love Brian, who has personally worked with us to make our event perfect! The food is amazing! The servers are very friendly too. Highly recommend Chompie's for anyone who is craving delicious deli food AND for anyone who is interested in hosting a party or event."}
{"text":"We come to AZ for a long weekend each year during spring training. We found Chompie's last year and I'm so glad we did. We went back this year and again enjoyed fast service, good food (very delish baked goods) and an extremely family friendly atmosphere) my almost 2 yr old said 'AMAZING' when he got his Mickey Mouse pancake). They are very kind, the manager checked on us twice and the hostess slipped me a big cookie to give our toddler as a snack 'when I wanted to.' Great experience!"}
{"text":"Can I give zero stars? 

We just finished our meal at Chompie's and I felt I had to write my review while the memory was still fresh, unlike the food. It was my worst meal in a long, long time. 

Our server asked if we were ready to order as soon as we sat down, which is odd considering the menu is 6 pages long. Tip one: don't eat at a restaurant that has a big menu because it means they don't do anything well. 

I ordered the Biltmore Benedict with a potato latke side. The Benedict was SALTY. It was salt-lick salty. I couldn't eat more than a couple of bites. The latke was a tasteless potato puck, only harder. 

I guess it's partly my fault because if I had wanted an \"authentic New York Deli,\" I should have gone to New York. My bad. 

Tip two: don't ever go to Chompie's."}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan of challah bread! Awsome!"}
{"text":"The deli has decent new York-style knishes, although they seem pricey. The bagels are very good, much better than you'd get in Fry's or the like. The pastries are very good. The service - not so much. Another lady and I (not together) came in the other day and the single deli person was on the phone taking a long order. She saw us there (since she didn't seem to be blind and we were three feet away), but didn't smile, hold up a finger, or in ANY way acknowledge our presence. When she hung up - ditto. She completely ignored us. There were several people milling about in the back and behind the counter and they, too, ignored us. I finally had to call out to a guy to get service. That is NOT the way to treat paying customers. If I hadn't had a craving for pastrami and a bagel, I would have left. The pastrami was excellent, very pricey, and it took a long time to get it once ordered. I would only go back if I was desperate for a knish. The staff needs to show a minimum of RESPECT to the customers!! I am only giving a rating of 3 stars because of the quality of the food: if I was rating only the service, it would be a 1."}
{"text":"My sister always tells me, \"I had breakfast at Chompies.\" Being from California, I have no idea what Chompies is, so I decided to try this place out for dinner.  The table where we sat at was dirty. My brother-in-law had asked the bus boy to clean our table, in which he had a hard time scraping off what was on the table.  My sister took her baby wipes out and was able to get the crust off the table... Not to mention dirty menus. Cleanliness is important to me, so this brought this place a star down from what I would have originally rated it.  Our waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable. His name is Dylan. He recommended the chicken schnitzel... SO GLAD I GOT IT! It was a chicken breast covered in a very thin crispy batter.  The chicken breast was very moist.  It came with my choice of two sides, in which I choose the broccoli and potato pancake. The broccoli was perfectly cooked and not over cooked at all. I can also tell the broccoli was fresh and not frozen broccoli that most restaurants serve. Potato pancake was perfectly crispy in the outside and soft in the inside. I had a huge serving, but was able to finish it. =) I posted my picture if you would like to see what I had. 

Dylan definitely gets 5 stars for his excellent customer service.  Can't wait to try their breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Chompie's is a fun place to go in AZ.  My kids saw the Jewish Slider Challenge on Man v. Food so when we were in the area visiting family, it was high on our list of attractions (and there's not much to do in AZ).  

The mall that Chompie's is in is not that great (not when you think about the Scottsdale Fashion Plaza...but I digress).  When you walk into Chompies, you think for a second that you've walked into a Jewish deli/bakery in NY.  There are lots of roomy booths. The waitstaff is pretty nice and attentive.

The bakery has 2 full cases of cakes and cookies- all of your NY classics- 3 color cookies, macaroons, black and white cookies, jam cookies, canolis.  It's a diabetic nightmare, but so tasty!

I've been here 3 times. Had the Jewish sliders every time!  Don't forget to order extra gravy for dipping.  The matzo ball in the matzo ball soup is too tough, but really huge.  I also have had the stuffed cabbage and really enjoyed the tart, sweet, savoryness!"}
{"text":"This is my husband's and my favorite place to come for breakfast.  I have never eaten lunch or dinner here, so can only vouch for breakfast. And it is awesome! This last time I got the Torrey Pines omelet and oat bialy...the omelet was melt in your mouth good. My husband got the banana nut pancakes which were twice as big as his face for one. He usually gets the bobka crumb french toast, which I would classify more as dessert it is so sweet, but so delicious! I have never  been disappointed with anything I have gotten. The dessert case is incredible looking but I have never gotten anything from it...one day I will though!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Went in for breakfast.  Nobody at hostess station for 5 minutes and then flagged to a booth where we sat for another 15 minutes without a hi, hello, here's some water and I'll be with you in a moment but the two groups that came in after us got coffee and their orders taken.  A little acknowledgment goes a long way and we ended up walking out."}
{"text":"Gotta say my initial impression was not good.  My Mom & I asked for outside seating and then were completely ignored....twice!  I suggested that if they weren't going to have a server outside they should not offer that seating option.  That said & after complaining to the host, server Linsey was VERY attentive.  Manager Zach talked with us for several minutes.  Food is excellent!! Had the Reuben!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, fast service, delicious food off the menu, yummy bagels and to-die-for desserts in their deli.  This place is worth the visit every time.  The folks that work there are always so nice."}
{"text":"Place rocks love the NY styled Deli the Chala bread here is delicious and so is the pastrami sandwich portions are big suggest maybe sharing if you go with your girlfriend or family"}
{"text":"I've got a fever of 103.6 degrees.  I called Chompies at 8:50PM, ten minutes before they close.  The guy who answered told me if I got there by 9:00PM then I could buy some matzo ball soup, the age old cure for feeling like sh*t.   I say \"for sure I'll be there\" and hop out of bed immediately and drove over, sick as a dog, fever burning.  I arrived at 8:58PM, just to find out they had dumped out the remaining matzo ball soup and closed up.  Real cool Chompies, I've already had bad experiences with service there, now I'm definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"No, honey, you're not in New York, Chicago, or L.A.

See those tanlines on your thighs? Yes, you're in Arizona.

Your backsweat confirms this.

Out of the car, sexy. It's time for lunch.

Nope. Definitely NOT Brooklyn.

NevertheWoodyAllenless, Chompie's does a wonderful Jewish deli impression.

Wait! Not an impression. It's the real, cop-a-feel deal Holyfield.

There's a meat market near the entrance, with acres of sausage (heyooo!) and a bakery for takeout, with all the usual delicatessen suspects. Off to the side (not a sideshow so much as it's the main event) is a brightly lit, \"don't even think of comparing us to Applebee's\" casual, sit-down restaurant. 

Whether gorging at home or in public, Chompie's is your Heavenly, Hebrew enabler in case your \"I only eat healthy chick food\" waistline has a deathwish.

What a way to go, ho!

- fantastic soups of the day
-  salad, done right (as in, mostly dressing, cheese and [chosen meat], with a token 
   offering of lettuce
- sandwiches that consist of a huge platter of meat with a couple of triangles of toast 
   hidden somewhere beneath
- gravy, Gravy, GRAVY
- pickles. On EVERYTHING.
- French fries that are served in portions large enough to share with everyone at your 
   table, or at least one very fat man.
- attentive servers that aren't snooty or b*tchy or ignorey (not a word, but whatever)

The only possible drawback is the slightly Disneylandish pricing of the food, but meh, it's not really Futureland-bad. 

And anyway, would you rather have a $15 Mickey Mouse pencil topper that you'll end up losing in your P.E. locker under a bunch of socks, or a $15 Reuben sandwich that can feed an African nation for the foreseeable future?

'Sactly.

Oh, and mom called.

She said f*ck your diet."}
{"text":"Ate at this place today and ordered a Cabo skillet . Except the name everything else for this dish was bad. Denny's has better menu than this place."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, super nice servers, decent prices. We grabbed a lemon bar on our way out and that was the only reason I took away a star. It was too sweet, not enough tart. For $3 I expect a real lemon bar!"}
{"text":"For Phoenix, the pastrami at Chompies is unbeatable...period."}
{"text":"Very disappointed by Chompie's today, it seems they have gone downhill in their food preparation in the last year or so.  The restaurant is also outdated and needs some fixing up.  The cheese blintzes which used to be authentic are not water down to a real sweet treat rather than what they used to be.  Their bagels, well they are not longer the original bagels they used to make they must be skimping on the flour and not boiling them as real bagels are boiled.  the fruit cup they give with breakfast is small and only about a mouthful when it used to be much bigger and the hashbrowns mixed with onions is way way salty avoid at all costs.  Will not be going back disappointed in the quality of food.  The service was great, but the food was not even 2 stars. Oh yeah they do charge 1.50 if you want real maple syrup with your hotcakes otherwise they give you syrup with high fructose corn syrup in it."}
{"text":"IMO, Chompie's gets a solid 4 for food.  I have never not had a good meal here.  Sandwiches are intense - brisket and turkey is my favorite.  Great knishes...  Overall, really decent deli and great rye bread.  :)

My complaint, and why I dropped the star, is that I have also never not been wrongly overcharged, or had them get a take-out order wrong.  This happened today, in fact, as I was in buying a lot of Mothers Day pastry.  And I was charged for items I didn't receive.  Same thing always happens with deli takeout too, though more often, they get the order wrong.  Of course, you don't realize this until you get things home, and you'd think I'd learn to double check before I leave, but the place is always a bit of a madhouse.  

Good food, but if you do take out, check things before you pay.  They seem to have an issue with not getting the items and the bill to coincide."}
{"text":"While the food was tasty, the service and attitude of our waiter were atrocious!
Appetizers and entrees were brought to the table at the same time.  Some entrees were very delayed and resulted in one member of our party refusing his meal when it was finally delivered since everyone else was done eating. When several of us pointed all of this out to our waiter, he never apologized. Instead he was very defensive. It was horrible experience.  Many other tables had the same results while we were there."}
{"text":"I've been to Chompie's between 5 and 10 times and I always have a great experience.

When you walk in, the hostess will be to your left and the deli on your right. Great prices on yesterday's bread, by the way, and they still look really fresh (but I personally haven't tried them).

Like others have said, there is usually a bit of a wait to get in (especially on weekend mornings) but it's worth the wait. Prices aren't too bad--they're fair but if you're eating in and you tack on some O.J. and coffee, you'll be looking at close to 20 bucks for your meal alone.

Most of the time when I come here, I'm just grabbing something from the deli and taking it with me somewhere (like Tempe Town Lake or South Mountain). Solid experience every time I do this--just be sure to tell the person behind the counter exactly what you want exactly how you want it."}
{"text":"Awful service.  Despite the restaurant being half empty we were put on a wait because our party of 5 was too big to sit.  They continued to seat 3 parties of 2, before I went to ask how long the wait would be.  I was told awhile.  Servers had time to sit and talk but couldn't possibly be bothered to help us.  We left and enjoyed the Kona Grill for lunch."}
{"text":"I had the Jewish Sliders following Adam's recommendation (Man vs. Food). You get a traditional Sunday meal Americana in a sandwich bite (including the gravy). Excellent! I'm going back for the other great stuff on the menu. You can take your desert to go as you walk through the bakery on the way out."}
{"text":"Went to Chompie's Friday around 3:15 and the restaurant was basically empty.  Staff was prepping for the ASU soccer team luncheon and we were told we couldn't be seated until after they arrived at 3:30 and we'd have to wait an additional 10 - 15 minutes after that to place our order.  This was ridiculous.  This location seems to be ran by young non service oriented college students.   I've yet to see the service quality that you get at the other locations."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Tuesday,  had a little wait, figured it was a good sign.

The food was really good, I had the turkey Reuben and cabbage soup.  My friend had the Jewish slides and onion strings also all very good.  A little pricey as it was $40 for both of is, but we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This place was great. We had been trying to go for almost a year now but when we drive by and see the line, we tend to retreat and go elsewhere. I understand why. I love how large the selection is and the fact that they are really flexible with their menu/choices. Makes it easier for us unfortunate folks who have to eat a strict diet (damn you self image!!) 

We had the roasted turkey sandwich with everything on it (minus mayo) and had it on low carb-high protein bread. Amazing bread by the way. It's like \"eating nothing\" as my husband puts it. Only 60 something calories per slice and only 1g carb per serving! You can buy a loaf to go but it will run you about $5 a loaf, but if you go now they are running a buy 1 get 1 free deal. 

We also had the tomato bisque, which was rich, creamy, and delicious... Our trainer will not approve of that selection. Oh well! Extra hour of cardio should take care of that. 

Overall I enjoyed my experience there. Loved the music too. I'm a big fan of the oldies. 

Try to go after 3 pm. If you try to go on the weekend... Be ready to wait 30-40 minutes before 12:00pm. Popular Sunday after church location."}
{"text":"My first time there today and I will say I was very very impressed. I ordered a pastrami on Jewish rye with Swiss. It was one of the mile high sandwiches which I could only eat half. It was filling and absolutely delicious. The staff Waiters awesome! I was offered a free dish of dill pickles which I thought was pretty cool. Atmosphere is perfect. And the bakery Deli is outstanding."}
{"text":"NY style? Imposter. Lol not bad but I'm from NY and maybe it comes close-ish. The prices are not good. Sandwiches are good, not great. Defalco's on Scottsdale road is far superior for deli."}
{"text":"What a fun place, the food was fantastic & the service was amazing! We're new to Chandler & this restaurant is right down the street, we'll be coming here frequently! Be sure to ask for Zach, his customer service skills are great & he's very informative/helpful, thank you Zach for the experience!!"}
{"text":"This place is a belly buster...

Go hungry because the sandwiches are huge. I got the roast beef and it was fantastic, way better than that processed crap that you get at the grocery store, they roast it themselves. My friend got the pastrami and it looked awesome, I wanted to trade.  Also, the sweet potato frys are great, if you've never had them, give them  a try, you'll love them..."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for over ten years. Great food, super super wide variety of entrees. Oh, and excellent bloody marys. The north scottsdle location always looks like a scene out of \"florida retirees monthly\" so if you are a bit younger I would suggest the tempe or PV locations. Besides that, real tasty. Give the chicken salad sandwich mile high a try."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times now. I've gotten the Rachel's Ruben every time. It's a turkey Reuben and very tasty. I also have always gotten a bowl of the matzo ball soup with my sandwich. The entire reason I like this place is because of this soup. I wish I knew how to make it, it would save me a lot of money. I love the stuff. The sandwich is good too, but usually I'm just still on cloud nine from the soup I forget that I'm even eating a sandwich. I've had a few different desserts from the case. Very good but a little underwhelming, but that won't stop me from trying more. Last time, we got our food to go, which I kind of preferred. With the exception of the first time being there, we have gone at odd hours of the day and service was lackluster. Barbie is fantastic and we had her during lunch service the first time we went, but since then we have been seated and then NO ONE has come to our table. This is three of the four times we have had a meal in the dining room. In fact I think two of those three times I've had to wave the host down to tell her and another time I waved a server down and she hesitantly said she would be our server. It's just so bizarre. Even though our tab is usually around $35, I hate throwing away another $7 to a server for lousy service, but I also think it's lousy to under tip as I am a server myself. So that's my two cents on that. I think we have resolved to just get take out from now on. Save the extra $7. But I love the food and my mouth waters for matzo ball soup as I write this!"}
{"text":"Sunday 4:14pm. Met my 2 sisters for lunch. We weren't super hungry and just wanted something small. We ordered the spinach artichoke rangoons (which came with homemade ranch) and the Jewish sliders (which came with brown gravy). Both were delicious! I wish I were more hungry so I could order more! My only complaint was that the challah bread was a little hard. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Chompie's for years - I love deli's and this is one of my favorites. This is my first review for this location, where you can occasionally find me at lunchtime.  

The variety of menu options to choose from at any Chompie's is mind-boggling. Every now and then I will try something new, but I usually end up ordering the Times Square New Yorker with pastrami because it's my favorite. Like most of their sandwiches, it arrives piled high with enough pastrami to satisfy the hungriest customer. It does not disappoint. 

One day I got brave and ordered the Texas Longhorn burger. For the uninitiated, this beast is a half-pound burger topped with smoked brisket, cheddar cheese and coleslaw. I'm not a real big fan of topping burgers with other types of meats - but this thing was amazing! Tender, juicy and great flavor. I would recommend this to any burger fan, but do not - I repeat - do not, eat this if you have somewhere to be afterwards. This sandwich will take you down. I'm not kidding. Like you will need a nap to let your body recover. And probably some cholesterol medication. 

On my last visit here our server brought us samples of the apple strudel, which was really good. I will definitely order this on a future visit. 

Now, with the good comes the bad - and there is one issue here that I see I'm not alone in experiencing. SERVICE! At this location during the lunch hour, my co-workers and I have just sat at the table waiting for anyone to come take our drink/food order. On other occasions, the server is prompt and on top of everything - but it took an eternity for our food to arrive. Very inconsistent. It has reached a point where we now tell the server upon our arrival that we are in a hurry - just to get normal service.

The food here is amazing - I love this place. But they need to figure out their service issues here. I would have given them a 4-5 star review, but I'm not going to give them a pass on this. I'll be back again - let's see if they can address what myself and other reviewers clearly recognize as an issue."}
{"text":"Edward our waiter was absolutely amazing!!!! Grabbed lunch with my brother who remembered Chompie's from a visit 12 years ago. Awesome food and service!"}
{"text":"Chompies for an early Father's day breakfast and our impression of our first Chompies breakfast is \"FANTASTIC!\" .  Dad had an Idaho Omlette and I haven't seen him eat an entire breakfast in quite awhile. My husband had, what he claims to be, the BEST pancakes ever!  Mom and I both chose a Lox & salmon pumpernickel bagel breakfast which was so good that we both ate the entire plate that was huge and included fresh cucumbers, red onion slices capers lettuce and lemon wedges to drizzle the lemon juice over your salmon/lox. Our favorite breakfast place now!  Thank you Chompies for a wonderful breakfast for our Dad's (and Mom's)."}
{"text":"One of the best places in town for hearty cooking.  There is little on the menu that I have not liked.  The portions are perfect sized and it never disappoints.  We eat here at least once a month or so. 
On rare occasions we have had a less than stellar meal, but even then it is above average.  
For breakfast... it is awesome."}
{"text":"Chompie's is going downhill.  The last couple of times, the food just hasn't been good enough to justify the prices.  If you order well done hash browns, they don't cook them longer, the drench them in oil.  Really awful.  My girlfriend called in a takeout order a week ago and they messed it up and it was expensive and lousy.  I used to go there once a week.  Now, don't think that I'll be back"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch spot with a great diverse menu and baked goods. I still swear  one of the best corned beef reubens I have ever had was here. And I have had corned beef reubens on the both coasts and overseas.... Great place to grab lunch and a half dozen bagels for breakfast for the next morning."}
{"text":"Quantity and quality.

I enjoy the pastrami and corned beef.  I tried their hotdog and found it very tasty.  The potatoe cakes are awesom although I dont eat them with the applesause because I just don't get that.  The fries are decent but I avoid the cole slaw and potatoe salad as I'm not a fan of the flavor profile.  The portions are very big.  My mom ordered a small chef salad and found that to be very large.  The Jewish sliders are wonderful.

They have a wonder bakery with cakes, slices of cake, cupcakes and an wonderful assortment of cookies.  

Of course they bagels, every flavor and all the fixings to go along with them.  They also sell their breads packaged for take home."}
{"text":"\"That's mold!\" my sister said to describe the green layers running through the entire cake that we had picked up only a couple hours earlier at the PV Chompie's.  The cake we had just put in front of our spouses and kids.  I loaded a picture of the cake that has to be seen to be believed.  How old does a cake have to be to have this much mold running through it?  It's shocking that food professionals would allow a product as dangerous as this one to be eaten.  We took it back from our family and back to the store. The GM gave us our money back and offered us something else.  She mentioned something about talking to the bakery about the cake.  This is one situation that a GM can't make right to the customer.  Dangerous food is unfixable, and a red flag to a potentially systemic food handling problem in the restaurant.  Nope.  Keep your replacement pastry.  In fact, keep anything else you've got to serve, Chompie's.  I value my family's health too much to risk serving them your food again."}
{"text":"I really dig Chompie's new location in PV Mall.  Much nicer than the dated '80 murals and design of the old 32nd street location.

Chompie's is always my standby when I feel like having breakfast for dinner.  Last night I treated myself to some delicious whole wheat pancakes (they have a nice hint of cinnimon) and some hash browns.  It was tasty and filling.  No complaints.

The service at Chompie's has always been excellent.  The staff is friendly and you get served quickly."}
{"text":"This place reminds a lot of the NY Jewish delis......great food, service and family atmosphere.
The menu options are endless.."}
{"text":"My friend told me to try this place.  After describing the menu to me she added that this was a Jewish deli.  \"Does that mean portions are huge?\" \"Yes.\"  And they are.

This is a typical restaurant setting, with full service waiters, none of that order-at-the-counter nonsense.

I was supposed to try the pastrami sandwich on challah, but after reading Wendy's Favorite I couldn't resist.  The sandwich I got had an insane amount of thinly sliced turkey, lettuce leaves, red onions and lite cranberry mayo on cracked whole wheat.  A very good sandwich in theory, but the turkey was incredibly dry.  This could have been fixed by adding more lite cranberry mayo, but the waitress was hard to get a hold of.  For $11.79 it should have been better. 

The sandwich came with a side and I opted for french fries.  These were some of the best fries I have ever had.  They were made with high quality potatoes (at least that's what my dining partner told me) and were thick, more like wedges than fries.  Spiced well and complimented the BBQ sauce that I asked for nicely.

I also had a pancake.  It was thick, had a big diameter, but didn't taste as outstanding as I thought it would.  Good value for the price.

As you walk in you see a cart full of day-old breads/bagels for decent prices.  If I ever ate food at home I would have bought some bread, but fortunately I don't have to worry about supplying food for my kitchen."}
{"text":"The high quality of ingredients comes second only to the huge portions.  The sandwiches are fresh and the challah bread is killer.  Desserts are also wonderful, although I would pass on the red velvet cake."}
{"text":"As a girl raised on bagels in NJ, I have very high standards for bagels. I always say a good bagel doesn't need to be toasted. I believe Chompie's has some good bagels, but they are toasted standard. The flavor & texture is pretty close to what I am used to, and I applaud how good they are being so far from the east coast. The lite veggie cream cheese added a nice touch to my everything bagel. The serving size of my plate was HUGE! I couldn't finish it all. I chose home fries, but wish I had gone with the hash browns. The menu should specify better bc upon reading the description - I believed I got a hash brown AND either home fries OR fruit. No biggie though. All in all, the service was good, the food was good, and I was happy & would most certainly return if in the area again."}
{"text":"Ordered the NEW Buffalo Chicken sliders and they were still raw inside  our waitress quickly took them away and brought back BBQ sliders - complimentary  food was great and service was outstanding"}
{"text":"This location is by the ASU campus .. the service is good, the food is good, the dessert cases are good .. nothing great about this place .. 

I had the tuna melt with fries.. I like the tomato slices and choice of bread .. fries are good .. my bf had the buffalo chicken sandwich.. he says he wished it was hot.. 

We split a chocolate box cake .. the ganache & mousse were yummy .. the cake part was a little dry .. 

Overall we'll be back because the menu covers everything and everybody in your group.. and the food and service is consistently good 

The location in Scottsdale has an amazing bakery and cakes !!"}
{"text":"Went to the Chompie's Deli in Chandler, near the Galleria Mall.  I've been here a few times before when travelling in the Phoenix Area.

It is good, honest deli food.  It's not quite like a real East-Coast deli, but close enough that most folks won't know the difference.  The menu is about a mile long, as is traditional for a deli.  The food was pretty good.  Our server was a little new, and I think a little confused.  But that's more a training issue than a service issue.  They did a nice job and I was satisfied.  I'd been going through \"pastrami withdrawl\" - had the mile-high.  It was good.  I also had the split pea soup and got to try the mushroom barley.  Both are also good and I'd recommend them highly."}
{"text":"Chompies is always a nice treat for me, any time of the day.  I finally made it over to this location and carried out a sandwich on Sunday.  I thought the service was a little slow here, and I don't know if its always that way, or just the fact that I was in there on a Sunday night.  So, they lost a point for making me wait, and wait, and wait some more.

I'll say this.  I like Chompies.  I don't think thier bad.  But, for some reason, I don't think thier all that and a bag of chips.  I think thier the best Arizona can do for good traditional Jewish food.  I would take my parents here in a heartbeat, being the Jewish girl that I am.  And belive me, I grew up eating all this stuff and more, so I can tell you that I am a pretty good judge.  I think this is the best the Valley has to offer so far, for being close to Jew food.  I just know its not the BEST Jew food I have sunk my teeth into."}
{"text":"Being the nice Jewish girl that I am, I love good Jewish food.  Finding this place was the closest thing I could get to good home cooked Jewish food.  Its not the greatest deli I have eaten at, BUT, I think its the most authentic deli that the valley has to offer! 

The portions are huge, wide selection of food, deserts and deli cases.  They also offer Holiday dinners for those of you who may be Jewish and not have family out here to celebrate those holidays with.  I reccomend it!

They are quite expensive tho!"}
{"text":"This place is overrated, over priced and over sized! The sandwich I had today had no flavor and was not made how I asked. I will not be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"I'll be very honest...the only reason I went here on a recent trip to Phoenix is because of Man vs. Food.

Having said that...the food I had was awesome!  I got the original Jewish Brisket Sliders and it is a Jewish guy's wet dream.
Three sliders made with Challah (nice!), deliciously tender brisket (nice!), crispy latke (double nice!), and an onion ring (chaching!).
All served with natural cut fries and some brown gravy.

The only way this would have been better is if it was served up by a half-naked Natalie Portman (you have to keep health codes in mind).

Can't wait to get back to Phoenix and go to Chompie's again!"}
{"text":"Great effort in recreating an nyc style menu. I was born and raised in nyc, and something is just not there. Not bad tho."}
{"text":"Our first time at a Chompie's. The food was great. The service on the other hand was not. 
#1. I ordered a deluxe salad with my dinner, but the waiter brought a small green salad. I mentioned that I ordered a deluxe, so he corrected the problem, however I did think it was strange that the deluxe salad I was served did not include croutons while the small green salad did. If you are a fan of chunky bleu cheese dressing, don't order bleu cheese dressing here. It is like watered down mayonnaise.

#2. The hot food was delivered almost immediately after our salads.

#3. My wife ordered a bagel sandwich and requested the cheddar jalapeño bagel. Her sandwich came on what looked like a plain bagel. Not necessarily the waiter's fault except a good waiter will check his orders before serving them.

Had the place been crowded, these mistakes may have been more understandable, but it was 4:30 pm and our waiter had, at the most, 3 tables.

Like I said, the food was great. I ordered the corned beef and cabbage. They slice the corned beef thin. I prefer it thicker, but that's just a personal preference. Great flavor and not a lot of fat. My wife's pastrami melt was also great (in spite of the incorrect bagel). Lots of meat with very good flavor. The fries were delicious and crisp!

I also think the prices are very reasonable for the amount of food."}
{"text":"This is for those who have to eat Gluten Free (like me; due to Celiac Disease)...
They have a GF Friendly Menu, and yes it does even say the kitchen CAN CROSS-CONTAMINATE...which we all know is a risk, but I got so excited to see GF waffles, I just had to try them.  Sadly, within 10min of eating the quite delicious, supposed GF, waffles I had to run to the bathroom & lots my food in a public bathroom (NOT a fun experience).  

The truly disheartening part was how things were then handled by Management... 
As I exited the bathroom with a \"flushed\" face & pain in my abdomen my waiter saw me & asked if I was ok...I told him no, as I had just tossed my cookies in the bathroom & suspected the GF waffles to not be so GF!  
I returned to my table where my friends were waiting & said we needed to leave as I was ill... They had already paid the bill.  Then as we are exiting the Manager stops me to let me know the GF waffle iron is by itself & not used otherwise.  I graciously tried to say \"things happen\" & asked they watch more carefully... 
  NEVER did the Manager offer any consideration in the form of a partial refund, a gift certificate to come back, ANYthing that would try to retain me as a customer!!

I understand food allergies are hard to deal with, but the lack of effort by the Manager this Saturday morning was laughable.  

I will not be back & caution ANY GLUTEN FREE peeps to steer clear!"}
{"text":"First time at Chompies and it was hard to decide what to try first. Seeing as how we live about 90 miles away in Tucson I wanted it to be worth the trip. I had heard all about the Jewish Sliders from Man vs. Food so those were a must. But I'm a huge fan of Eggs Benedict so I could decide which to get. Then add soon as I seen you could add a slider to any entree I was excited!! My wife had the Patty Melt and Fries and she said it was good, not to die for but good (it's hard to top the Patty Melt from Johnny Rockets). My Benedict was great! The Hollendaise Sauce was so good I didn't even use ketchup for my Hash Browns. Even the leftovers were great the next day back home!! But there's so much more to try there that I can't wait to go back. Plus the location is great, near so many things to do. I'll see you again soon Chompies!!"}
{"text":"Been to this new location twice. The first time was the second day they were opened, and the manager was very visible/busy trying to make sure all the customers were happy. If you know Chompie's, this is a more updated location with the same quality of food. If you don't know Chompie's, you should. Seriously, they have something for everyone. A Jersey girl born and raised, I know from New York bagels. These are the closest you'll find west of NJ/NY. No contest. I have tried and loved the pancakes, eggs, bagels of course, sandwiches, and the chicken soup is better than homemade, sorry Grandma. The pastries, cookies, and cakes and scrumptious. The only thing I ever tried that was less than satisfactory was the brisket sliders. (Meat was way too tough.) Oh, they serve Pepsi products, but the manager insisted they will soon offer Coke in cans, like the other locations do. Great food, ample portions, pleasant staff, and reasonable prices with tons of parking and never a long wait. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I just love going here originally from Chicago and now I  live in SURPRISE I have good friends from California New York recommended  this restaurant thank you"}
{"text":"Chompie's is the restaurant I receive gift cards to for birthdays and Christmas.  Chompie's is gold in my opinion.  The Jewish sliders, the fried matzo balls, and a 3.99 traditional breakfast Monday thru Friday really put this place over the edge.  The bagels remind me of brueggers, the perfect hardness on the outside and softy and doughy in the middle, and the selection of types is never-ending. This place really is outstanding, If I were promised to not gain disgusting amounts of weight, I would eat the BBQ brisket sandwich everyday, juicy and tender."}
{"text":"As anyone who reads my reviews, whether you like them or not, you realize I have two passions, corned beef and pizza. I knew I wasn't going to go here for the pizza, but from their menu, I thought I had a good shot at getting a decent hot corned beef on rye with mustard. Wrong. I have ordered a lot of items from Chompie's, the majority of them very good, which is why I gave them 4 stars. They are unique, their menu items are novel and I enjoy the variety. Where they fail, oddly enough is in the basic deli items. Their corned beef was not as tender as it could be. It was not sliced thin, there was not enough fat. Mo H remarked how good the pickles were? Really? I felt they were too soft, and not tart enough, although I do prefer a half sour.

Where Chompie's hits the mark is with their unique menu items. You must try the \"Jewish sliders.\" This is basically a shabbas meal put on a challah bun. Brilliant. The brisket is amazing. So tender, like butter, the potato pancake is perfect, I don't know why they add cheese, but I would ask them to refrain. It is terrific. Their matzoh ball soup is one of the best I have had. The broth is superb. Not too chickeny, although the cup contains a bounty of carrots and celery, the soup is not overpowered in their flavor. The matzoh ball has the perfect density.

If you are in for breakfast, try the breakfast skins, but make sure you have about 8 people with you to eat these. Another novel take on something which has become so common, potato skins. Who would have thought about taking a bagel, topping it with scrambled eggs, potatoes, cheese, onions, sour cream. It works, and it is delicious.

These are the kinds of menu items Chompie's does right. Unfortunately, the corned beef sucks.

Don't leave without buying from the bakery. It is not the best bakery in the world. Canters in LA does better cookies, White Plains bake shop puts everyone else to shame with the cakes, but for Scottsdale, AZ, the black and white cookies are pretty good."}
{"text":"My husband and I were out in Tempe today and stopped in to have brunch.  We frequent the Paradise Valley Chompies very often....there is absolutely no comparison.  This place needs a total rehab.  It looks dirty, the clientele there are messy, loud and obnoxious.  The waite staff is not at all knowledgeable.  Never again."}
{"text":"Went last week for the special 99cent Jewish sliders.  They were so delicious.  Not very big though and the regular price of $3.99 is a little high.  The side order of french fries were quite good.  They were even better heated up in my toaster over.  Got real crisp on outside."}
{"text":"It saddens me to write this review today regarding our dinner at Chompie's in Arrowhead Towne Ctr. My husband and I have been going to Chompie's Deli (in all locations) for the last 6 years and it is my favorite AZ deli.
Not so much today though.
Server was ok but advised someone else would be making my egg cream because she really doesn't make them well. I was 3/4 done with my sandwich when the egg cream came.. tI was not the best. 
I always order a pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and Russian dressing on rye... this time the  pastrami was under cooked... coleslaw almost non existent . very disappointing.
My husband ordered a roast beef sandwich that came very dry and over cooked.
The table next to us with 4 diners, up and left due to the fact that no one came to take their order. 
We have been to this location before and have been satisfied but today at 5pm there was clearly a lack of help..
Hoping Chompie's can get their act together and help this location."}
{"text":"Big new york style deli with sandwich meat stacked to the ceiling. We both had fired chicken salads but one of them was supposed to be the BBQ chicken salad. Our waitress was kind and apologetic and offered us free desserts but after having the generous salad plate we were stuffed. We also ordered the deep fried chicken pockets which are served with a thick gelatinous congelled gravy and fried onions... NOT good.
It is nice that it is close to APS and next time i will try a sandwich."}
{"text":"This location has gone downhill. It used to be really great, but the last few visits here have been weird. The service is just as fast and friendly as always, but the food has worsened. Once received a burger that was completely burnt and another time the matzo ball soup was so salty it was completely inedible. Have never had an issue with the food here before. Don't know what changed over the last few months."}
{"text":"This location is way better than the one in Tempe. The orders are always correct and the food tastes delicious. Chompies is an Arizona classic and this is location is one of the best. Service is fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Chompie's open-faced bagel sandwich but was disappointed. Eggs were too dense, the gluten free everything bagel was dry . We considered taking advantage of the yelp checkin offer of one free black and white cookie with bakery purchase but the bakery items looked tired. Elmo and cookie monster cupcakes were drooping. May try again but probably not. It was busy so they must have some excellent options."}
{"text":"Well my last experience at Chompie's wasn't good at all, which was incredible deviation from my previous visit, but it was bad enough to leave a mark. Luckily the manager reached out to me with incredible service and invited me back to make it right. Yesterday I finally had a chance to do so and it was a wonderful experience...

I called in my order to go and Hannah warmly answered the phone and correctly took my order (substitutions and all). She told me they'd get it ready and come on in. I arrived to pick it up 10 minutes later and there was Hannah at the front pastry case to cheerfully greet me and grab my order for. I ordered the Holland Tunnel Sandwich with extra pastrami instead of salami accompanied by coleslaw and it was prepared perfectly. Along with my sandwich I checked in on yelp (yay!) and got a free black and white cookie, and also ordered a giant eclair and a couple butter cookies (soooo good). I paid for my food and was delighted with my interaction with the staff and quality of food that I had picked up (such a different experience than before). When I got it home to devour, the meats were juicy, flavorful, and lovely, and the pastries delicious. What a treat! 

Chompie's has an enormous menu and everything on it looks good, it's hard to decide. The portion sizes are extremely generous, so you won't be hungry when you leave. The only knock I have is that it is very pricey, for one sandwich (it was big) and a few pastries it was over $25.00. I did enjoy every bit of it though! 

I am happy to report that my previous experience must have been an off day, and that with the wonderful management, friendly staff, and amazing deli deliciousness I will be back many times. Chompie's is back on my recommendations list!"}
{"text":"My new office is near PV Mall. Don't know the area yet, so I did a search on Yelp for lunch and was thrilled to find Chompie's so close by! I ordered lunch to go (shoutout to my awesome cashier Edward G): chicken salad (which is listed as award-winning on the menu, totally warranted praise) piled high on an everything bagel and a side of fries. This review was originally 4 stars when I started composing it because the total was $11, which is a little exorbitant, but the expedient service and best bagels in the valley bring it to 5. Can't wait to make this a staple in my week."}
{"text":"Best breakfast and lunch place. You can walk in and just order at the deli or actually sit down. The staff is super friendly and treat you like family. Their prices are super low and their bagels beat Einstein any day. They have food that is intended for Jewish customers but do not discriminate in any way. Super awesome place!!"}
{"text":"I have never been to New York. So, I don't know how \"New York\" this place really is. However, the sandwiches were great!! The menu is a little overwhelming at first. There was so much food to look at, I thought I'd be there for days. But, they have a great special on Monday nights. A free Half Mile sandwich with the purchase of a Full Mile sandwich. This immediately brought our attention to that portion of the menu. He got Turkey and I got Chicken Salad both on Challah Bread and we split it. The Chicken Salad was amazing and the turkey was right off the bone like Thanksgiving leftovers. I would recommend this to anyone and plan on going back."}
{"text":"Have been coming to Chompie's since I moved from NY to Arizona, and never have once been let down (from food or service). This place gets chaotic on the weekends but the staff does a pretty amazing job at making sure all their guest are taken care of in a timely manner. I hold a special spot in my heart for a good bagel, and these are damn near close to what I get back home! Which is saying a lot since I'm a mild bagel snob. All of the waitresses I've had have been super charismatic and friendly even when they are extremely busy they will still start up a conversation with you. Karen is one of my favorite servers at this establishment and has been taking care of me for over a year. She always has my coffee topped off and making me laugh harder then anyone can at 9am! If you are ever in the Phoenix metropolitan area and need a great east coast diner meal, I highly recommend Chompie's in Tempe! (Definitely try the Jewish sliders, that is what they are famous for after all!)
 I am puzzled as to how the review below me could remotely bad mouth this establishment and Karen. Surely the woman doesn't work in the industry if she planned to \"run a bitch around and stiff her\". Well hopefully she won't return and waste a table space!"}
{"text":"walked in no one around , lots of empty tables in both areas , bunboy comes out and asks for our name and says 15 minutes to get seated , really , too lazy to clear a table quickly and get the two parties waiting seated when you can clearly see empty tables . NO EXCUSE for such lousy attitude and service. Either learn how to run a restaurant or shut it down. Obviously no one on duty who gives one shi$. Left and went to a real restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, the service sucks. I have been in for breakfast lunch and dinner and they are all consistently under staffed. Tons of fun waiting for food, refills, check, etc. Would easily get a 5 if they can figure out their staffing issues."}
{"text":"Second time eating at Chompie's first time at the mall.
It was good, not great. Not a destination kind a restaurant for me, more of a \" I'm hungry place\".
It's got a narly big menu and they fill your plate.
Servers were kind and professional. From what I saw the place was clean. If you need to eat at the mall...do it here."}
{"text":"So after the 30 minute wait which is totally fine we get sat next to a bridal party of 15 college age girls...so loud...dude!
Service was quick enough and was very helpful in navigating the huge menu. 
Ordered the chicken &waffle...ate every bite. Saw some other plates...huge portions! 
So all the food seemed very fresh and the prices were fair.
The bagels are made in house and are some of the best I've ever had.
Last words...need a quiet spot for breakfast, don't bother. Needing to get a gut full of good stuff, sure."}
{"text":"A true Jewish Deli is very hard to come by out in the west, however the Chompies chain (Yes, it is a chain, but don't let that deter you) has brought the luxury of the matza ball back into my life. This place offers a full bakery/deli/restaurant to its customers and though it may be a bit pricey, it is well worth the money for the quality you will receive. I hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm still a Chompie's fan, but this last time it was just a little weird.  I stopped in for a late lunch with the MIL on a beautiful sunny day.  This Chompie's was hopping, and despite a nearly full parking lot, we found a spot up close.  Walking in we were seated quickly on the patio.  Our server soon appeared with menu's, and with an over-played Brooklyn accent, she took our drink order.  

The MIL wanted to get just a sandwich, but the server insisted they don't do \"just sandwiches\"  Wife says she will take the MIL's side of fruit.  From this point, we hardly saw our server, until, of course, the manager started serving us.  Then she was all about checking in several times.  But, I digress.  The manager delivered our sandwiches, and somehow Miss \"I really am from Brooklyn because you can tell from my accent\" interpreted giving the side of fruit from my MIL's dish to my wife as splitting the MIL's sandwich and delivering half of the sandwich a bowl of fruit to each of them.  Whatever, we worked it out ourselves.  

I had a half-sized Brisket on multi-grain (which looked more like whole wheat) and chose Coleslaw as my side.  What I got for a side of coleslaw seemed like a joke.  I had also asked for some mayo on the side as I know Chompie's Brisket runs on the dry side.  My side of mayo was larger than my side of coleslaw.  The wife had a Belgian waffle with strawberry topping (yes, strawberry, as in one strawberry cut up) and a giant dollop of whipped cream.  She enjoyed it without much comment.

Despite these oddities, we had a nice lunch and it was a decent meal.

Yeah,  I would go back, but maybe to a different location."}
{"text":"The food was tasty but this place is not friendly to people who open carry. The manager said \"no guns allowed, it's posted out side\". I told him no problem and went and secured my weapon but, upon closer inspection, found no signage anywhere stating that it was a gun-free zone. After I went back inside I saw a small sign hidden behind bottles of booze at the bar, well inside the establishment. WTF! Your food is the only thing that saved this from a one star rating."}
{"text":"Great spot.  Great \"Phoenix institution\".  They have many awesome sandwiches.  The Western Sliders are really awesome.  The Jewish Sliders are good, too, but the brown gravy just doesn't do it for me.  I've only been to this location, but they have locations all over.  Must check it out."}
{"text":"We've been back to Chompie's several times and we really like it.  Everything we've ever had to eat here is quite good and the service is always excellent.  It's definitely the best Jewish deli we've found in the Valley."}
{"text":"Unprofessional and uncourteous. We attempted to make a reservation for a party of 40 in their semi-private room for an event we were having five months later. When I called, I was put on hold for about 4-5 minutes for almost every question I had about the reservation because each person had to ask the manager. Why they didn't just have the manager speak directly to me or have the manager call me back at a later time was beyond me. 

Given the large number of our party, I figured would at least get the courtesy of speaking to someone who could give me pricing and requirements for the party - if not over the phone right then and there, maybe a few days later. But, instead, I got the \"someone will call you a week before the party date\" brush-off. I mean, c'mon - I was reserving FIVE MONTHS in advance! Could I at least get answers from someone well beforehand?! Needless to say, I quickly changed my mind and we decided to have our event elsewhere.

We were disappointed that we couldn't have our event there because we love the food ... But with how difficult it was to get answers, it just wasn't worth it. Subpar service like that would have ruined our celebration."}
{"text":"We had a party of 20 for a birthday. Couldn't be more pleased with the professionalism, flexibility of management, semi private room for mingling, fantastic service, and excellent food. Appreciate a well managed restaurant for making a fun and successful party. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Chompies offers my personal favorite fish and chips in Arizona

For breakfast I have really enjoyed the  Teh Bobka French Toast, it is amazing with a extra kick with the Bobka sprinkled on top. I have always enjoyed the personal service even when the place is crowded, and expect lots of people all the time.  

I can't forget  the Lox and bagels its as classic as it gets.

happy Eating

The menu is very large just like the location in Tempe."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to come to Chompie's in a Sunday afternoon. Not sure what to expect. Anyways, wow. The place is jammed pack. Everyone is here. 

So I had their breakfast here before and wasn't that impressed. Today, I ordered their full hot pastrami sandwich on a Kaiser roll with a side of coleslaw. Goodness. So good. I love hot pastrami sandwiches when done right and they did it right. Nice a juicy with lots of flavor in every bite. Loved the Kaiser roll too. Very fresh and the roll just made the sandwich really good. The coleslaw was really good. Had a little bit of sweetness to it. I really enjoyed this meal. 

My wife was craving a salad. Really at a deli. Anyways, she ordered a Grilled Chicken Cesar's salad. It was a really big portion and she just gobbled up that salad. She really liked it. Didn't get to try it but looked really good. 

Our service was right on. We sat at our table and right away they brought us a small plate of dill pickles. Love dill and they were really good. Anyways, our server welcomed us right away a told us he would be right there in a minute. On the spot he was there takin our order. Water glasses were at our table fairly quickly and they had people filling up our glasses. Our food came out really quickly and our server was always checking on us even through it was really busy. 

I would have to say that we really enjoyed our meal here. Quick and efficient service with some really good food. We saw that dessert menu and was really temped, but maybe next time. Enjoy we sure did."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of guys from my Men's Group. We decided to meet here at 6am. Wow. Really early for me. Anyways, as I assumed nobody was here except for my friends. I thought it was a big dining area and they had a big back room that we were able to sit in. 

Our waiter was really good and got our drink orders as we sat down. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash Skillet. It was layered with home fries, corned beef hash, cheddar cheese, and scrambled eggs. It came with your choice of bread and I chose the English Muffin. Huge portion. It was pretty good. Thought the hash was good. Very filling. I could barely finished it but somehow managed. 

Service was really good. I didn't expect anything else since we were the only tables that early in the morning.

So at 6am there was good service, food was okay but they do serve breakfast all day which is good. I'll be back but have to try their pancakes and French toast. This will tell me if they have good breakfast or not. Enjoy. I did."}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast. I've ordered about 4 different items and they are all outstandingly delicious. It's usually pretty busy when I go on the weekends, but it's like a 5 minute wait to be seated- which is fine. I really love this food and this place, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I wanted to get a special cake for my daughter's 16th birthday with out spending $100+. Then i remembered that Chompie's has a bakery.Their baker is so talented and made a beautiful custom cake for my daughter for a fraction of the cost of these specialty bakeries. I couldn't be happier! Thank you Chompie's!"}
{"text":"Came in with a group of 27 http://valleymoviegroup.com. Good seating arrangements - they reserved us space. Service slow (drink coming out and entree) . I am thinking the kitchen was a little slow and not so much the wait staff, although they were a tad slow, but of course we had a big group. Nice onion ring appetizers. Food prices a little on the high end from what I would have expecting. Tasty though, don't get me wrong. I had the pastrami sandwich."}
{"text":"I still absolutely love this restaurant,  however today was somewhat of a disappointment as we ordered our favorite turkey sliders with a cup of soup and the soup was served without the little bagel chips and they forgot to put the delicious cup of nosh coleslaw on the side. We was too busy visiting with my clients and didn't realize it till I had left the restaurant, otherwise I would've spoke up."}
{"text":"A trip to Chompie's Jewish Deli (4550 East Cactus Road, Phoenix, AZ 85032) affords me the opportunity to feast on the best Motza Ball Soup around. The hearty consomme' is loaded to the brim with sizable motza balls, noodles, shredded chicken, celery, carrots and onion. Complementary, home-made pickles, crunchy to the bite, are served as an appetizer. For dessert, I always enjoy the almond-tinged Rainbow Cookies, which are served from the extravagant dessert case, with a cup of fresh coffee. I recommend you check out this restaurant, which is located in the Paradise Valley Mall, for an affordable experience in New York-style deli cuisine!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here the other day. There aren't many places left where you can get a two egg breakfast, with potatoes, and a bagel, for $5.99.

The latke was delicious, and very well done!

The cheddar/jalapeño bagel was really delicious!

The other thing that I love is that you get plenty of cream cheese to go with your bagel.

This wasn't my first visit, and won't be my last."}
{"text":"Food was decent but overpriced for the quantity.  Service was disorganized and slow.  My wife stood at the bar for 5 minutes before being acknowledged and they werent that busy"}
{"text":"NYC style deli with fast & friendly service!

Pickles were just like the ones they serve in NYC delis and big sandwiches. Jewish sliders are a must try. Sandwich with a side was just under $17 (NYC deli prices too!) Going to try the breakfast next time!

Located near Macy's at Arrowhead Towne Center. This location just recently opened and it looked pretty busy at lunch. Yay!"}
{"text":"My first and last... 
This place when I first walked in was pretty neat... to have a little bakery.  For that Ill give at least a star.   My second star was because I liked the waitress and manager they were very apologetic for the absolute rude and horrible customer service hostess.   She really needed to take customer service 101 and manners 101 seriously!!   Left a bad feeling so my friend and I just left.   Didn't even order, we were that disrespected so we just left."}
{"text":"We had the Monte Cristo which was suggested by Anthony our server.  It was amazing!  Anthony is awesome and an asset to your establishment.  We ate at the PV Mall location."}
{"text":"Well it is a little pricey...But other than that it is a grat glimpse into what a New York Jewish Deli is like. Half Restaurant half deli. The place was packed luckily I was by myself and could just order from the Deli and sit in the express eating section. I was so Hungover from the night before and I ordered up a storm with the Jewish sliders and bunch of pastries. 
The Jewish Sliders were unreal. Challah bread with Beef Brisket, Pepper-jack, Potato Latkes, and gravy.. Oh man! You get 3 with the order and they even have a Man Vs food challenge of 12 which would be impossible!! The potato wedges were ok, no salt and they forgot the gravy..I will for sure return next time I am in PHX!"}
{"text":"My friend took me to Chompie's on my first visit to Arizona. We split the Jewish slider challenge with two of her children and brought the leftovers home for the rest of her family! We also had Lovey's smoked salmon tapas as an appetizer. OMG.  This was definitely my favorite meal of my trip!"}
{"text":"Definitely not impressed with the corned beef here anymore.  Matzo ball was nice and hearty.  Brisket is ok.  Potato pancake was good.  Corned beef was just not authentic texture or taste.  Just a regular generic corned beef   Not true kosher deli corned beef"}
{"text":"Place is nicer than I anticipated, but I think I just had it confused with Blimpie's. Extensive menu. Kind of like an upscale Denny's. Lots of old people. Not that there's anything wring with that. Got the Heuvos Rancheros. Price was about 15% too high. Service prompt but neither rushed nor overbearing. Wish the crowd was a little hipper, like me."}
{"text":"Great place for our meetings. Love the fresh Bagels. Service is outstanding the coffee is endless. Start your day off with a bagel."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants. This place is an exception. Food is always perfect. The service is fast and friendly. This was my first time ordering breakfast. The latkes were spot on, and Edward, our server was great."}
{"text":"Walked in and sat right down for a weekday lunch. Ordered right away and now, 45 mins later, we've been assured our food is next. I'm not sure what that means, but I am sure my boss doesn't give a crap. They get the 2nd star because this place isn't always like this. But, seriously, it's not busy."}

{"text":"Chompie's! I got so excited when I saw it was only 5 minutes away from the hotel we were staying at in Chandler, AZ. So, we went there for breakfast one day.

We were seated right away and were a little overwhelmed by the HUGE menu that was handed to us. We started off with coffee and were able to pick from about a million different creamers. I got the Chompie's Breakfast Sliders which were scrumptious:) Challah, potato pancake, sausage patty, fried egg and american cheese. Oh, and a side of fruit (so I didn't feel as guilty). My boyfriend got the Stuffed Pancake...lets just say I don't think he read where it said, \"Extra Large\". A pancake with scrambled eggs, and crispy bacon rolled burrito style. Both him and I could have shared it, it was that big.

Anyways, it was yummy and we were stuffed the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Thrilled Chompies has finally come to the Westside. Service is slow but if you haven't had an egg cream, knish, or matzoh ball soup lately it is worth it. Their brisket sliders /pancake on mini challah is to die for. They need to stop deep frying coney  Island knishes . They need to be just grilled not deep-fried. Lovey you should know better. Other than that food is great."}
{"text":"One word...awesome! Chompies is authentic, the food delicious, and the service prompt and friendly. We eat breakfast here every sunday. I highly recommend the classic french toast and for lunch or dinner the Jewish sliders are amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place... often go on a Tuesday before I go to chorus rehearsal, and knowing I'm going to sing later helps me (usually...) not eat too much.  The last time I went I had the Monte Cristo which was huge and wonderful. It is one of those weird sandwiches with ham, jam, and the bread is fried with powdered sugar on top. Sweet & savory in one go! I had to eat it with a knife and fork because it was way too huge to try and pick up with my hands.  I ate about a quarter of it at that time, took the rest to go.. had about 1/4 of it after chorus, and then finished the rest the next morning driving back down to Tucson... I thought it held up quite well!

I love that that give you a plate of pickles to 'chomp on' while you look at the menu and wait to order.  

They boil their bagels, and according to my friend who used to run a bagelry in Tucson, that is the best! 

Since going there, my diet is changing to plant-based and low-wheat options, and I know their menu can accommodate many \"XYZ-Free\" diets/lifestyles, so am looking forward to seeing what I will have next time."}
{"text":"I went to Chompies tonight with Valley Movie Group of meetup.com
This is the first time I've ever been to Chompies and I couldn't wait to run home and tell you how AHMAZING! my sandwhich was. 
I ordered the Aaron's Choice which is hot corned beef and pastrami, swiss cheese, coleslaw, and 1000 island dressing on an onion roll.
This sandwhich was huge and stuffed full of meat. I assumed I would only be able to eat half and take the rest for lunch tomorrow. That's what I thought UNTIL I sunk my teeth into that sandwhich. It was soooo goood. The meat was tender and melted in my mouth. I could not stop eating and eating. This sandwhich could solve all my problems. This sandwhich makes the world a better place to live in.
I would recommend this sandwhich to ANYONE.
Service was great as well."}
{"text":"This is the best Jewish deli in Arizona. It reminds me of being in New York City. Everything in this restaurant is the licious. You can't go wrong with anything. I love their pastrami and corn beef and tongue sandwiches and their Cole slaw. 
They also have really good chicken in the pot and great matzoh ball soup. 
They also have a great bakery and all the desserts and cake so wonderful."}
{"text":"I love Chompie's! Their bagels are amazing - soft on the inside, just a bit crisp on the outside, and well seasoned. Beware though, if you get cream cheese, they will give you enough for 3-4 people! Their bread is also great, love their Jewish rye and pumpernickel. If I want to indulge for breakfast, I'll get the corned beef hash, which is made in house and is great! 

I get their matzoh ball soup anytime I am sick or if I'm missing my mom's cooking. Their sandwiches are delicious and outrageously large, and I love their house-made chips. The Jewish sliders are so yummy, definitely a guilty pleasure. My one disappointment was coming here for a pre-fixe Passover dinner one year - the food was all mediocre and just made me more homesick for a good holiday meal. But for a regular meal out, there is something here for everyone."}
{"text":"Chompie's is an awesome place to have good American food. Especially in the night time, the ambience is so awesome! The waiters are so keen and always at the call. You can get a descent plate with mouth watering full dish of food for $11.. The breakfast Menu is available for dinner too.. As the shop was closing for the day, they offered a bag of bagels as gift, which was so awesome! I really recommend this place for anybody who wants to have real American Menu!!"}
{"text":"Not once, but twice we received the worst service I can remember ever receiving at a restaurant.  The tall, semi-bald waiter in the first area walked away from us while we were still talking during both visits, and the second time he never brought us our drinks or asked us how our food was, yet we were billed for those drinks and there was an issue with the order.  While this was going down, the afternoon manager dramatically swoops in the front door and comes over to our table with the following statement, \"Calm down, the beverages have been deducted from your bill!\"  As though doing the right thing in the end deserved a round of applause.  Then, as we were getting up to leave, the waiter offered us a free dessert...kind of an afterthought because other customers saw and heard what had been happening.  No, thank you...an apology for his haughty attitude would have been much more well-received.  I prefer going to Canter's in Los Angeles, and will just resign myself to the fact that there is nothing like it (or that even comes close) in Arizona.  Canter's has wonderful customer service, whereas the management of this eatery evidently does not train their employees adequately in that regard; even the deli person was indifferent during a third, separate visit (knishes to go).  The food means nothing to me when the service is poor, and I won't be returning.  P.S.  Tried to call the person in charge of complaints of this nature and was never able to speak with him personally due to an extended game of phone tag.  Sad.  Even in Hollywood, waiters and waitresses are aware that good customer service = no complaints, and great customer service brings out the generosity in even the worst of the world's Scrooges."}
{"text":"It's been at least a year since I've eaten here and things have deteriorated.

First we waited a while at the register to be seated. They seated us in a booth that had pitchers of water right behind my head. We moved to another table.

The Lox and Bagel was almost $16. Maybe that's a normal price now but seems expensive. When I last ordered this there seemed to be more lox. We had to ask for pickles - last time they were given to us without asking. Two little olives on the plate. One little skimpy container of cream cheese - I should have asked for another because it just barely covered the bagel halves. Lots of capers which was good.

I got the impression that they are having financial problems.

The dessert counter person was excellent, though."}
{"text":"Chompies is consistently good. I was there for breakfast again this morning and my omelet was perfect! So were the potatoes...and the bagel...of course. Good stuff! We were greeted and seated quickly and our waitress was great too. It was my friend's first time there and she took the time to explain their expansive menu and offer up a couple of her favorites. And I picked up some babka to go. Their bakery, deli and bread displays are huge! I've never been disappointed with Chompies."}
{"text":"Been here once and order a tooon of food delivery from them (through Doordash). We had just discovered this place shortly after moving here as they have gluten free items. We usually order the gluten free everything bagel sandwich with roast beef and it's always delicious (they give quite a bit of meat)! The best part is that they have a gluten free peanut butter brownie that is to die for! We have only had an issue twice where the bagel wasn't what we had ordered (the receipt did list what we had asked for). If it's a different gluten free one then it's fine but there was once when my boyfriend couldn't eat it because they had given us regular instead. For the most part it has been good hence the 4 stars. 

If you aren't gluten free then I recommend the Monte Cristo (batter dipped-deep fried sandwich). I love that this place is in the mall because I can entice my boyfriend to spend an extra 20 minutes shopping if it means we can go here after hehe."}
{"text":"My first visit to Chompies and it was delish!!  So much to choose from on the menu it took me forever to decide.  My waiter was patient with me and offered up some suggestions.  I was bad, so bad.  I had a Monte Cristo Sandwich with fries.  

While I waited for my food I took it all in.  I love the NY vibe, the walls with pictures of NY and all the great things about NY.  It made me want to get on a plane and take another trip to NY!!!  And there are several TV's to watch events.  This evening I watched the Mets play and sadly, they lost.  

My sandwich was delish!!  Nicely dusted with powered sugar and the ham and turkey were excellent.  The fries were perfect, crispy on the outside and fluffly on the inside.  And my waiter checked on me several times which I appreciated.  

I cannot wait to return and try more things off the menu.  I thought it was a bit pricey but the food was good and the portion was generous.  I took half home.  I am giving three stars for now but I'm sure I will bump it up after I've tried the  potato pancakes and the matzo ball soup.   *drool*"}
{"text":"A Sunday brunch disaster! We were seated at 9:50 am . . .our food finally arrived at our table at 11:20 am.  90 minutes - not a typo.  Our server didn't take our order for 20 minutes. The service was slow and I'm not sure if anyone was working in the kitchen!  We found out 30 minutes after we placed our order that they were out of Latkes and 2 of us had to reorder our food (out of latkes on a Sunday morning??)  We came specifically for the Jewish sliders!  It was another 20 minutes before we got our food . . .and half the dishes were cold.  The manager came over (finally) and said she'd have the dishes remade fresh.  She let us know with her attitude and tone that she was not happy with us (?)  Ridiculous.  We never did get the items we requested (tea refills, the cream cheese spread that was missing from one plate, etc)  The brisket sandwich is not made with brisket; it's definitely top round.  We should have walked out. We let the manager know it was our first visit.  She gave us a short apology, turned on her heels and walked away.    Can't understand why they are so busy.  Our meals were not worth any of the drama or the wait."}
{"text":"The best matzo ball soup I've had in Phoenix. The sandwiches are also amazing. The bakery/pastry area is dangerous!!! Fresh cannoli, chocolate eclairs and really anything else you could want. I don't think you could have a bad meal here even if you tried."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing... Food took a very long time to come out and mine was cold and cooked incorrectly. I will say that they did at least recook it and took it off my bill.  Overall my food was still below average though."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong here.  The food is fabulous no matter what you order and the people are friendly and coffee is good.  Its one of my favorite places to eat breakfast in fact im going there again this weekend!"}
{"text":"I loved how they have a sit down restaurant style and a deli in and out style of service! I was however not a fan of the coffee. However the bagels were great! Being an east coaster it is hard to find fluffy bagels but Chompie's nailed it. The girl who helped me was awesome in explaining things as it was my first time here. I would come back !"}
{"text":"Wish  I could give zero stars.  I waited over 20 minutes in their take-out line to buy a container of cookies.  The employee behind the counter never acknowledged the people in line...just walked away leaving a line of people and no one behind the counter.  By the time someone did help, no apology for the lack of service.  Maybe this is just part of the annoying New York schtic they have in the restaurant, but if so, it lost them multiple customers.  I will actively disuade anyone I speak with from visiting the restaurant.  I cannot express enough...avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"The deli meats were tender, juicy, and full of flavor; I really liked that Jewish slider too, yum!"}
{"text":"Chompies is fabu.  They have a huge menu and their breakfast items are so good, I've never even been able to venture over to lunch.
If you're wondering, I always get the veggie omelette (hold the mushrooms and scallions) and a bagel with jalapeno cream cheese. 
The server will bring you out a plate of cucumbers and pickles right when you sit down and they're usually fast to take orders and bring out your food. 
Be sure to check out the mural painted on the wall while you're there. There is a man holding a knife and if a diner is positioned just right underneath him, it looks as if he's about to be shanked.
Word to the wise: if you come on a weekend morning, be prepared for at least a 30 minute wait."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and tried their sliders and thought they were good. However, I had the breakfast sliders the other day and was really unimpressed with my meal. My boyfriend was also disappointed in his meal."}
{"text":"Haha... So I came in here to take on the Ultimate Slider Challenge on 06/10/2013 with a group of friends and made a video compilation of the whole thing.

Check it out on youtube to see the result: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzrfpQv63nk

{"text":"I've never actually been to the restaurant, I've only had their food delivered.  But everything I've had, I love.  My favorite is the Turkey Dinner, which comes with stuffing and your choice of two sides.  Their stuffing is now on my list of official cravings, I love it that much.  Their meal portion sizes are huge; no way I can finish one of their meals in one sitting."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. Service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Well it is over a year later and I must say service has improved. There is a new counter person and he really tries to get it right."}
{"text":"This was a tough review for me.  I wanted to give them higher marks, really I did.

I went in with low expectations.  I've had Jewish food on the east coast, OK?  Things were looking good right off the bat.  We were seated and water and a tray of pickles appeared as our tushes hit the cushions.  My lovely wife picked up a pickle, crunched off a bite, gave a surprised expression and said, \"Not bad.  I'll be the Jew-judge.\"  She is Jewish, after all.  Fair enough.  I thought the pickle was pretty good, comparable to some I've had on the east coast.

That's where things started to go awry.  It took between 5-10 minutes before anyone came over to get a drink order.  We ordered several items to share.  My wife and I shared a corned beef sandwich and fries with gravy.  The kids shared matzo ball soup, blintzes and a latka.  I ordered coffee.

The soup came first and it was very good and authentic.  Coffee?  \"Oh, right.\"  My water has been sitting empty for a bit.  The rest of the food arrived pretty quickly, and my coffee arrived.  Water?  \"Oh, right.\"

The blintzes were very good, especially the cheese.  The corned beef was good, it passed muster as authentic.  Fries?  Good.  Brown gravy?  Fine, but it had an odd flavor.  Latka?  Very good.  Water?  \"Oh, right.\"

\"Can I get a refill on the coffee?\"  \"Oh, right.\"

The prices are high.  The sandwiches are available whole or 1/2.  $13.xx for a whole corned beef is a bit high, but it is big enough to share so that's a plus.  One sandwich and one order of fries was enough for 2 adults.   The fries were $4.xx  

Coffee?  \"Oh, right.\"  I don't appreciate having to ask for every refill 3 times.  I would probably write it off to just one server having an off day or something. 

In summary:  Good kosher-style food, a bit pricey.  It will hit the spot when I'm craving a corned beef sandwich.  The service was spotty.  So what may have been a 4 star review has been knocked all the way down to 3 stars.  

Coffee?"}
{"text":"Chompies did a great job with a little UYE group of about 15 folks.  I had potato pancake, 1/2 corned beef sandwich, onion straws and fried matzo.

All quite tasty!

Well done once again Chompies!"}
{"text":"Been here two times since my last review. I love this place. Yesterday I had the southwest omelette with an iced coffee. Here today enjoying another breakfast before I hit the road. 

Must try is the southwest spread with a spinach everything bagel, the Baja omelette."}
{"text":"Very busy on a Saturday morning. I had coffee and a baja omelet with home fries, everything bagel, with southwest schmear. I look forward to being back asap!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at chompies for something like 20+ years and my last experience there was so awful. I will never return. I picked up a to go order for my sick mother and when I got home several things were missing and/or wrong. When I called chompies to let them know about the errors the person on the phone attempt to blame me for their mistakes. I asked for the manager who was also useless, he too blamed me for the problems with the order. Putting pastrami rather than corn beef on my Ruben is not my fault. Nor is forgetting to put the matzo balls in the matzo ball soup. Stay away at all costs. The staff and management are horrendous!"}
{"text":"My first time ever at a Chompie's was yesterday morning at this location.  We needed to return something at the mall and made plans to come here for breakfast.

We were seated right away and the place is a lot bigger than I thought it would be.  I've always seen the small part of it from the inside of the mall but once you enter the main dining space, it's the size of what you'd expect a full service restaurant to be.

Service was average; food came out at a decent time and coffee refills were timely.  I ordered the breakfast sliders and hubby got the Chompie's benedict.  The sliders were big!!  And incredibly filling.  I thought I was going to need a wheelchair to get myself out because I was so stuffed.  It was very tasty and with great difficulty, I was able to finish the order.

The benedict dish was also pretty big.  He had made the request to have his eggs soft poached and they delivered beautifully.  He commented that this was one of the better eggs benedict he's had anywhere.

I would love to return to try different items.  Hubby and I were so glad we tried this place out!"}
{"text":"Food was good once it arrived. Unfortunately I asked for crispy potatoes and they were definitely not crispy. Reeding the reviews from employees(All Chompies I believe) I would have to agree they need more staff, so they can serve the food quicker. We were all in a rush to leave by the time the food arrived."}
{"text":"It was good.  Had the pastrami and liked it.  Great pickles and the bakery is huge."}
{"text":"First time there. Read the reviews and man is this place great. Wife and I had the sliders. To die for. Then she got the monte Cristo. I had the pastrami burger. Both were amazing. Everything I saw coming by or near us looked delicious.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had to rewrite my review. Have been here 3 times and only the first time was the food top notch. Visited right after it first opened and had the hot pastrami on rye with a Coney Island knish. Both brought back memories of NY and being close to Carnegie Deli quality. 
Second visit was for another knish. This time the outside was chewy and was obvious that it was reheated in a microwave instead of on the grill. One more time, I thought, and my last visit was another hot pastrami on rye. The meat was so fatty I could hardly eat any of it! I complained to the waiter, who said that was what they got in and he offered to send me home with another sandwich. The meat should never have made it past the pass and served. I would rather have been told the meat was sub-par and ordered something else. I was sent home with another sandwich, unfortunately, it was with the same fatty meat! Not sure I will go back now. I hope they do not start cutting the quality of their food now that they are established."}
{"text":"Meh, slow. No service to speak of way too much $$ for the so so food. I walk in the front door, no one greets us. We didnt know where to sit. It was chaotic. The pastries are good, but I wont be back."}
{"text":"I grew up going to Chompie's and feel like i've had so many things from their menu but haven't even come close to trying it all -- their menu is like a novel.  Breakfast -- love their mexican options like their chilequiles, all of their bagels are amazing -- I recently tried a salt bagel with pumpkin cream cheese mmm. Lunch/dinner -- they make amazing matzah ball soup, all of their sandwiches are huge and amazing, plus they have a bunch of bread options - I love their egg salad one.  Desserts -- they have really yummy pastries like cookies, cupcakes and typical jewish ones like hamantaschen"}
{"text":"This had to be one of the worst sandwiches I've had, I ordered  the 1/2 Reuben pastrami on rye with the chicken noodle soup. I expected pretty lean and tender pastrami, this was really rubbery, greasy, tough, fatty, gristly meat. I tried one bite and I couldn't chew it enough, I let my waitress know immediately that I could not eat it but I would like to keep the soup because that was delicious . Lots of veggies. I thought they would have charged me for the soup since I did eat it. When I got home and looked at the receipt they charged me fun price. That was disappointing. We also bought a piece of German chocolate cake and a tiramisu cake to take home. Both cakes were tasteless and extremely dry. I would rather have played seventy two dollars in a slot machine . What a waste of money! Go anywhere but this place in Arrowhead Mall."}
{"text":"Huge Chompie's fan here and this was my first visit to this location. 
Ordered the corned beef and cabbage meal with potato pancakes for the sides. 

Delicious! 

Great service water glass kept full and as a bonus the mall wifi was strong enough to make it a working lunch. 

No trip is complete without a visit to the bakery counter for some treats!  

Looking forward to my next visit to Phoenix to get me some more !!"}
{"text":"Love this local chain.  
Service is always good, food is delicious (though I only ever get the Jewish sliders lol) 
The sandwiches are truly piled high with meat. 

My perfect meal is the slider/soup combo. 2 Jewish sliders with the mushroom beef barley soup. 

These sliders are fricken awesome. 

When you're done don't forget to visit the bakery cases. This one is small but still some good options. (Paradise valley mall location has the AMAZINg options!)"}
{"text":"Years since I have been in the area and still love the food 

The bagel skins are huge!
The Belgian waffle great ...
Today I tried the breakfast sliders....delicious. 

Only disappointment was the service today.....coffee refills very slow...."}
{"text":"$16.49 for Aarons choice and the onion roll was stale.  This place still is not up to par."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Heard about this place on food network and decided to check it out with he family for lunch. Very delicious. Don't live in the area but will come back to try other things."}
{"text":"Had to prove my bro in-law wrong (he said there's no good Jewish deli in Arizona). We loved this place. The ASU servers were kind, quick, friendly, and courteous. Our kids ordered off the adult menu, which had much better options. They got soup (yummy chicken noodle and matzah ball) with Jewish sliders (mini challah roll with brisket, latke, and cheese with gravy---not kosher), which was to die for. Adults shared a burrito sized cheese blintz, an enormous sandwich, and a latke (just missing pickle on the side). 8 Thumbs up! (From family of 4). Would go back here every day if we could!"}
{"text":"Best bagel and delicatessen in town!

Chompies Rocks!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Az about a month ago and have just been driving around to find new restaurants to go to. I was driving down Shea and came across Chompie's. The logo enticed me so I decided to try it out. 
I first stood in the door way for about two minutes before anyone even acknowledged me. I was then seated at a table in a back corner, which was fine with me. The waiter was definitely rushing around, but he was nice enough. I ordered a bowl of chicken soup and a dinner salad and I was disgusted. The chicken soup was just broth and noodles and one single big hunk of chicken. About half the size of a regular chicken breast. I was grossed out to find this big chunk of chicken to be the only chicken in the soup. Then I was brought my dinner salad and it was just some browning iceberg lettuce with some cheese, unripe tomatoes, and cucumber slices on top. 
I feel that my order was so simple, that it should've been hard to make it bad. I can definitely say that I will not be back."}
{"text":"I have been going to Chompies for years and normally I would give it a better rating.. When our out-of-town guests wanted to go out for breakfast we immediately thought of Chompies. I knew it would be busy on a Sunday morning but I expected they know how to handle a crowd. There was quite a few people waiting for tables but when we registered our party of 5 we were told it would be about a 10 minute wait. We were seated 35 minutes later. While our server was nice and helpful it took another 30 minutes to finally get our orders in and get served our food. We immediate asked for a plain, unheated bagel for a starving and fidgeting toddler and had to ask about it twice before it finally arrived...toasted.  Our food, when it finally did arrive, was pretty good but not up to what I have come to expect from Chompies. I think they might just have been having a bad day but I will never go there on a weekend morning again and I don't recommend you do either."}
{"text":"There a comes a time in any mans life where he sits at his house and thinks about breakfast and has plenty of options. Then he gets a wisp of inspiration, perhaps its a commercial, a phone call, maybe just a random thought. But lifw is good when u ard chompies. Very solid breakfast joint. The eggs bendict were amazing, the chicken and waffles were very tasty as well. The only downside is that the syrup is mediocre. If every restaraunt used cracker barrells maple syrup then i would be broke, obese and have diabetes cuz its amazing. Ive seen the sadnwiches and they look massive."}
{"text":"Big menu and big servings

Never heard of Chompie's, so swung in to visit with the family. You're greeted by a large deli area with meats, sides, and baked goods.  To the left is a hostess podium where they make you wait a little while-- really for no reason as you can see open tables behind them. Maybe they just wanted us to take in the fabulousness of the deli area some more and get impressed.

We were seated in about ten minutes. Not the cleanest area, but the service people were nice and we liked the pickles.  About ten minutes after ordering, food came.  My daughter was a big fan of the hamburger.  My wife liked her sandwich and fried.  The pastrami sandwich was good, though I admit I had to use a fork and knife because bread simply lacks the structural integrity to handle so much meat.  

The blintz (sp?) was pretty yummy.  Cookies were dry.  Paying the bill was quick and pleasant."}
{"text":"I love the food at Chompies! I grew up on the east coast and this food reminds me of home. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Chompies overall was Awesome! 

Serves Breakfast all day!

It has been over 20 years since I have been here, and now I wonder why. I thought of it more of a bagel place, with some deli dishes rather than a full blown restaurant. I must have been baked with a wicked hangover way back then, because this was awesome. There is a lot of talk about Chompies because of Man vs. Food, but what really brought me here was that they served breakfast all day.

It took a minute or so to be acknowledged by a host to get seated, but once she showed up we got sat right away. Our sever was very nice, made some suggestions, kept up on our Diet Pepsi refills, and was there but not overbearing. 

We ordered the Banana Nut Pancakes, Omelet with Jalapenos (Cabo maybe), and a Killer Skillet with lots of Jalapenos and 2 perfect medium eggs placed on top. I got the blueberry bagel with walnut raisin cream cheese. The wife got a salt bagel with the jalapeno cream cheese (they were out of jalapeno bagels). The pancakes were very good, with lots of banana cooked in the cake, of course with lots of nuts as well. There was a lot of food. Well worth it.

We ordered a piece of German Chocolate Cake to-go. A few hours later we pulled that cake out of the fridge and devoured it with a quickness. Very moist, and the frosting was super yummy. 

I just checked for our leftovers, and it looks like someone beat me to it. Dam I was looking forward to that skillet with all the egg and potatoes. I guess easy microwaved leftovers is out.

In search of breakfast now!"}
{"text":"Never go here on a holiday, they serve food not fresh at all,service bad, & servers are not accommodating & do not care, tables dirty & never utensils"}
{"text":"People bringing in Animals to sit on chair at table, unbelieveable.  People lie about their animals, & management did notjhing.Dogs, should not be allowed in a restaurant unless service animal.Service animals never sit at a table or on chairs. Then the peppers in eggs was not cooked it was hard, told server & server said that is the way it is & people like it hard, even though I could not eat it."}
{"text":"We ordered a few items to go at the take-out counter after dining-in. We were helped by a young guy named Alex who was awesome!

I picked up some liverwurst for my husband and father-in-law and some cookies (rainbow, black and white) for me and my mother-in-law (you can see the difference in tastes here, ha).

I asked Alex what the best selling soup is, and he told me it was the chicken matzo ball soup. Something that is familiar, yet he described it in a way which made me realize it had been a while since I'd had any, and I've been thinking about it since! Guess I'll have to come back in for some! 

Overall I had a great experience between dining in, the giant display case for deli and pastries, and Alex's service. He was funny, knowledgeable, and charming. 

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"First time eating at this place, I had breakfast, french toast with bacon and eggs. And it was very good! Service was nice. Few weeks later i had lunch here, it was okay. I luv their breakfast but i wouldnt go back here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Large portions all around... my sister had the lox, my nephew had the corned beef and I had an omelet... great food and great prices. I would say it's an authentically Kosher place except for ham on the menu as well as the number of dishes mixing meat and dairy. Excellent bagels, however. As General MacArthur said, I shall return."}
{"text":"Service was on point!  Husband ordered corned beef hash skillet - had no flavor, and lukewarm.  I ordered breakfast sliders, delicious but again - lukewarm.  Had gone to 32st/Greenway for years, but this was a disappointment.  And $40 for two breakfasts and two sodas was overpriced.  Won't go back, unless it's bagels to go."}
{"text":"Was Absolutely one of the 2 best corned beef sandwiches I've ever had. Equal to if not better than Manny's deli in Chicago. If you're looking for a great corned beef sandwich, look no further then Chompies. Not only great tasting, also Huge, one sandwich can be shared. Great price for what you receive."}
{"text":"Solid four.  I can't believe I lived across the street in college and never went.  Breakfast is yummy.  I'm a chicken strip connoisseur and Chompie's a terrific."}
{"text":"Roxie took special care of us, thanks.  If Chompie's is a mile high pastrami, Roxie is the mustard."}
{"text":"Is yr Great Aunt from New York coming to visit -??? You need to stop at Chompies for all yr appetizers to keep them busy while yr meal is cooking ! Potato Knish , Latkes , bagels & dips !!!!"}
{"text":"Silverware for whole family dirty, coffee mug was filthy, food terrible.  Wonder how dirty the kitchen is!!! Would never go back!  Manager didn't seem to care!"}
{"text":"Yeah, this place is pretty good.

We live in Glendale (shut it, we know) and the food is definitely worth the drive to Tempe.  While I am sure this spot was always popular due to the food and location in the heart of ASU, its cameo on Man vs. Food has done nothing if made Chompie's a must visit for out-of-towners.  Have no fear, as the food does not disappoint, ESPECIALLY the sliders.  I cannot say enough about how good those stupid mini-sandwiches are.  They receive top billing and completely deserve it.

This is a deli and bakery in the truest sense of the word.   There are several menu options, but sandwiches and baked goods are the stars here.  Come hungry because Chompie's does not know the meaning of the phrase \"manageable portion.\"  Depending on the time, you may be forced to wait for seating, but that should reinforce the notion that you came to the right place.  To give you perspective, we came in July and gladly sat outside just so we could eat sooner, desert sun be damned.  

You really cannot go wrong here, but do yourself a favor and make sure somebody in your party gets the sliders just so you can steal a bite or 9."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for the past 3 years since I moved into the area, and only tried it the other day. It's okay and overrated in my opinion. The food is mediocre, the potatoes suck, and everything tasted pretty stale to me. Soggy and stale and expensive could describe my meal. We had the cheese omlette, sweet potato fries, biscuits and gravy, and brought coffeecake and butter cookies back. I tasted some of everything but the cheese omlette which was my order was really greasy and nothing special. Everything all together was $30 but more than half the food was left on our plates we didn't even want to save it. I will be ordering my omlettes from Dennys or IHOP from now on."}
{"text":"All you need to know is this: PASTRAMI!!!!! Fatty, peppery, soft and tender! I dream about their pastrami sandwiches. My mom had matzobrei and kishka. We had a ton left over. Service is always so so and the atmosphere is really casual. But, the food is exactly what you would expect from a New York deli. They have the most wonderful bakery and really wonderful bagels. My family is from New York and this is our go-to deli spot!"}
{"text":"If I could give this location NEGATIVE stars, I would! I have been schlepping to Chompies,first at 32nd street and then to PV Mall for my entire adult life.. It has ALWAYS been worth the drive! 
I have been to the Arrowhead location TWICE now and BOTH times have left disappointed. The bakery items are dry or not fresh and today I had THE WORST lunch experience with a rude and careless  waitress, bad food (I ordered New Jersey sliders and she brought me NY Sliders with less than a 1/4 teaspoon of coleslaw) took over 30 minutes to get me my food which was cold and missing coleslaw.. And then 20 minutes to come back to the table and check on my food only to be annoyed I didn't want it. To top it off, she took 20 or longer minutes to bring me my bill once I was done! 

Sorry Arrowhead.. You just lost a loyal customer 

Chompies! Lovey! Get this place to standards.. They are TERRIBLE"}
{"text":"This location has horrible service ! I love chompies but this location over charged me, I ordered a bagel with egg and cream cheese and she charged me an additional $3 for cream cheese. I think that's insane to charge $3 for cream cheese and I explained that the menu stated $.89 for cheese not $3. She was rude and did not give me the time of day. Don't go to this location if you have a choice!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars. My husband and I budgeted for a special breakfast for our son. Our son chose Chompie's at Arrowhead mall. We waited for 30 minutes for our food, and when we got up to leave, the manager made an excuse and didn't say sorry. How do you let people sit and wait for 30 minutes without talking to them about when their food will be arriving? Other people were being served after they walked in after us. This was a terrible experience, and it totally ruined the date we had with our kid."}
{"text":"Best corned beef and pastrami outside of Chicago and New York City. Seriously, this place reminds me of my year in NYC, and it's about as close as you can get in the greater Phoenix area. The sliders are amazing (try the breakfast sliders) and the potato latkas are even better (try them with apple sauce). The bagels are baked fresh, and they have great pastries that they make as well. The service is great, and the best part is that they are not overly busy and have quite a bit of room inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Scottsdale I stopped by Chompie's. First visit and based on yelp reviews. What a great place! Host was very friendly, father in law, who enjoys interaction with the customer. We ordered Penn Plaza and Meat Combo corned beef and pastrami special. Special on egg bread. Wow, meat was lean hot and tasty, side potato salad very good. Nice portion size! Server was terrific. Recommend highly."}
{"text":"Great comfort food! If you moved to Phoenix from the midwest and miss gravy, I'd head here. The jewish sliders are fantastic."}
{"text":"Great NY deli, complete menu, good service and very good food.  Fair prices, enjoyable experience.  Chicken soup with matzo ball makes a nice lunch,\."}
{"text":"The Jewish sliders are my go to. So dang good. Everything is always delicious at Chompies. The pickles are great and their potato pancakes"}
{"text":"I've ordered breakfast at many places.. but Chompie's blows them all out of the water! I absolutely love their french toast! My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. They have fantastic lunch and dinner, too. And the best thing is that Chompie's is reasonably priced. 

Please don't read too much into reviews with people complaining about any 'bad service' they've received. Sure, it happens sometimes. It happens every where, in fact. That is inevitable. But I think you're better off trying out Chompie's for yourself. I think you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Awful experience. It is obvious they do not have the proper staff for a busy Sunday afternoon. Waited over 40 minutes to be seated when we were quoted 15. Made a big deal to the manager and finally got sat. Ordered immediately and took another 40 for our food to come out and it was cold. Server never followed up on how our food was. Manager never followed up to see how we were doing. Definitely not worth $70 for four adults and one toddler. Love to support local companies but will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Custom made pastrami sandwich no problem. Meat was juicy and tender.. like the creamy slaw on the side.. homemade pickles...delicious.. the service was amazing by a lady running circles around college employees.. worth the walk"}
{"text":"This was the worst breakfast experience I have had in a long time. All three of our meals came out cold. I sent my French toast back completely soggy and cold. My husband said I've never seen you send a meal back...if that doesn't tell you how bad it was in that statement! The north Scottsdale was amazing! Unfortunately, this location was a disappointment"}
{"text":"First off, Robbie our waiter was fantastic and deserves praise for his effort.The score of 1 does not include anything related to Robbie, We thank you for the great service. Now I ordered the chicken soup with noodles (We had Katella Deli,Lindels and Benjies when we lived in Orange County Cal) so we are no stranger,s to this type of food.The soup bowl came out loaded with vegetables and small onions.All the other Restaurants mentioned simply had good chicken broth with matzo balls and noodles.Robbie did a great job in straining the soup for myself. Next they had Kishka on the menu but they do not serve it at The Mall Location in Glendale Az.(What the hey) if it,s mentioned on the menu..Then Serve It"}
{"text":"Chompies is the best for Breakfast, lunch & dinner food!  You always need a To-Go box!"}
{"text":"Among the best breakfasts I've ever had. The blueberry bagel was extremely fresh and the gravy skillet was too legit."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and stopped in a couple weeks ago with a friend who moved here in July. The corned beef Reuben was piled high and delicious! Our waitress was prompt and courteous! I'll be back in with my boyfriend!"}
{"text":"The day started horrible, my beautiful iPhone X was giving me issues, and my subordinate stepped on some dog poo and slipped and fell on it, and honestly he probably shatted himself from the fall as well....so we decided to eat at Chompie's.  

This place was clean and inviting and was filled to the max.  So we decided to sit out in the patio, and a good decision too since my subordinate smelled like a walking porter potty.  Service was fast and efficient, and the waitress was friendly and kind.

The price here is quite outrageous and the quality is average at best.  We ordered a cheese ham omelet, a side of bacon and some corn beef hash.  The corn beef hash tasted okay but looked awful, looked like a pile of poop, they need to cut the potatoes bits bigger, that'll make it more appealing.  

Overall a good experience, we'll probably come back when we are back in that side of town after tax season."}
{"text":"worst experience in take out history.. ordered a GRILLED turkey sandwich to go ...had been fasting for dr. appointment so nurse ran to pick up ,,,she was informed had lost my order... long wait. She arrives back at dr, office with a ungrilled dried bread sandwich..the turkey was cold dry and hard...no mayo .etc. just dry meat and bread..awful  inedible  nurse ran to a McDonalds and got me a fish sandwich.. also no fork to even eat the potato salad ..this is the second time in two weeks this has happened with this place..no raves from me"}
{"text":"Jewish Sliders are the second best thing on the face of the planet for hangovers. The service is usually slow and not very attentive. On weekends there is a 10 minute wait at least - but the food speaks for itself. Sammi's munchy crunchy wrap in both original and buffalo is a close second of my favorites. I would always get some chocolate milk and possibly a mimosa. Bagels are obviously great and they give you pickles! Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with wife.  We got the Holy Perogi as an app, she had the corn beef sandwich and I got the pastrami on rye.  We both enjoyed our huge sandwiches.  Service was great.

I was totally excited to see Italian cookies when I walked in.  Now I know where to buy them come the holidays!"}
{"text":"Came in with a party of 10 people plus a baby. A gentleman asked got us some drinks while waiting and complementary bagel pieces with cream cheese. Waitress was very helpful with suggestions from the menu. Very clean and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan. This place puts out consistently good simple breakfast and lunch - I have NEVER had a bad meal here. They also have an amazing selection of to-go deserts. Chompie's was also featured on \"Man V. Food\" recently..."}
{"text":"2.5 stars, really.  Hot pastrami on rye very good.  Cole slaw way too small a portion vs. the giantness of the half sandwich!   Had 2 tiny pickle spears, my dinner mate had 4 and we both had major intestinal issues that night!  The desserts were tasteless, unfortunately.  The server kept tapping our table every time he delivered something to our table or walked by.  Really weird.  Water/ice tasted weird.  Could be better, but I got my pastrami fix, anyway."}
{"text":"My visit to Chompie's tonight re-affirmed my reasoning for never, ever eating here or ordering food to go from Chompie's.

Tonight we placed a to-go order at my suggestion so I take partial responsibility for this mishap. When I walked in the manager was on the phone handling a complaint. After she hung up she walked away to the kitchen completely ignoring me. 

Next an employee called \"order for (customer name), which was the guy who had walked in behind me. She processed his credit card as I was standing in front of the register still unacknowledged. I finally said \"I have to-go\" order to which she responded \"just a minute\". 

When the employee finished with the guy behind me she took my payment and walked away. A few minutes later she came back and handed me the bags that had been sitting on the counter the whole time I was there. #SMH

Overall the service at Chompie's is rude at best. The dining room, when I've eaten there, is filthy. Other than their soup, I've never found much I like on their menu. Lastly the prices are sky high for mediocre food and crappy service. No. Thank. You. Never. Ever. Again."}
{"text":"Chompie's, I love you! I met a friend for a late lunch yesterday. I had the opportunity to study the menu very well (it had been a while since my last visit) I had the Jewish Slider combo. The brisket sliders on challah were delish. I actually took out the potato pancake because it made it too big to eat. This actually allowed me to savor all the flavors! For my soup I chose the mushroom beef and barley, which was my favorite growing up. My friend had the Matzo ball soup and half a Rueben. We left no crumbs. The service was great! One thing I missed was the pickles! 
I'll be back Chompie's!"}
{"text":"Anytime I am on Shea, I am here. Great food. True Jewish deli. Servings are large. I've ordered a wide variety off of the menu, everything from the lox to basic breakfast fare, soup, sandwiches,... and I've loved it all. Service is friendly. If they upgraded the outside eating area with misters and more shade, that would be a bonus. After you've realized you have zero room for dessert, don't forget to walk through the bakery display. I guarantee you will be leaving with a little something for later."}
{"text":"We used to like Chompie's, and don't get me wrong the food is still okay, but this location is getting pretty long in the tooth. 

We stopped by yesterday on the way home from Mayo Clinic on Shea. My partner had a test scheduled for 12:30 PM and couldn't eat anything before the test. Needless to say by the time he was done at 2:00 he was very hungry and unfortunately didn't feel well after the test. 

I figured Chompie's would be our best bet. He has always liked their food, especially the soup and that's something we could get quickly. Despite my previous review I've always had mixed feelings about Chompie's. It's always been a little pricey, the service can be spotty, I find the employees to be somewhat negative and condescending but the food is usually good. This visit didn't reinforce any of the positive thoughts I've had about them.

The server came by right away and took our drink orders and shortly thereafter took our lunch order. We both ordered Mish Mosh soup, one of our favorites and as expected it came right away and it really hit the spot.

The unfortunate thing about this location is that it has become terribly rundown. The carpet in the dining area is filthy, the tabletops are worn out and in general the place smells pretty bad. Not very appetizing. C'mon Chompie'sfor the prices you charge you can afford to take a little of your profits and give this place a makeover!

Next time we'll go to the location closer to home at Paradise Valley Mall."}
{"text":"I love Chompies.  I really do.  Just stay far far away from this place on Sunday morning / afternoon.  The place is incredibly understaffed.

Table for 3 with a baby.  Told us it would take 15 minutes to sit.  It took more like 30.  We sit down.  We wait 5 minutes, no waitress.  A table next to us get's seated.  They get greeted, get their drinks then get their food order taken.  Then the same waitress comes over and takes our order.  So now we've waited 30 minutes to be sat and 15 minutes to have a waitress come to our table.

I ask for 1 scrambled egg to come for the baby as soon as it's ready.  10 minutes later a manager comes to the table with our egg.  It's undercooked and cold.  Very mushy.  You would think being the manager, he's qualified to take a look at a scrambled egg and know this is undercooked.  It was quite obvious.  I send it back.  20 minutes later our food comes out.  Still no egg.  I ask the food runner.  She comes back with an egg that cooked fine but freezing cold on a very hot plate (a very tell sign that these eggs have been sitting under a heat lamp for 15 minutes)  If the egg was for me, I would have sent it back.  But it's for a baby and I would have cooled it down before I fed him.  

The food was great but never saw our waitress again after she took our food order.  If we wanted water or extra napkins, I got up and got it myself.  

This isn't my first rodeo.  My wife had her baby shower here on a Sunday and we got the same crappy service.  I need to remind myself to stop coming here on Sundays."}
{"text":"Ahhhh the place a Jew can go and get his food :-)  Being Jewish, sometimes I get the urge for Kreplach soup or chopped liver.  This place takes care of all my urges.  

From bagels and lox to corned beef, chopped liver and coleslaw sandwich.  I LOVE THIS PLACE.  They would get another star out of me if they lowered their prices.  It drives me batty to see what they charge for their food.

If I were them, I would add another inch to the sandwich to make up for the price.  Defiantly check out this place if you want a mile high sandwich.  If you are from NYC here on vacation, avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Great canoli, also enjoyed the jewish sliders and coffee cake. Cole slaw was mediocre.  The yelp deal for a free bagel was a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Chompies site will not allow us to post a 'paragraph' in a complaint to them - so here it is - BAD.
We have been loyal customers for over 11 years. We frequented ALL 3 locations until Greenway closed. We LOVE Paradise Valley and have avoided Shea since there was an error on our dining room order. Yesterday at 4pm on 3/19/2016, we were giving Shea another chance. Yesterday, we craved Chompies and this was convenient. So - We wait patiently behind 2 customers. We wait & wait & wait - while the girl with bright red streaked hair s-l-o-w-l-y mashed new cream cheese into a bowl taken from the case. Then 2 doors to the case are removed and she looks up & comes to take our order, while YoYo reprimands her for leaving a mess at the bread slicer. We ask for extra lean corned beef & before we could get the \"thin sliced\" out of our mouths she is running to the back to tell the kitchen. My husband goes to be sure she heard us and she rudely says \"YES. I HEARD YOU.\"  She comes & goes from the kitchen 3 times trying to weigh out the pound and a half of  corned beef till it weighs correctly - leaving us for 10 minutes at the counter - never asking what else we needed.  She finally returns with the container of THICK sliced corned beef. We ask for 1/2 # chopped liver and... get cut off before we can tell her what else from the deli case... At this time we are irritated & just want to get the order - pay & leave. A loaf of Challa sliced, one brownie - Chopped liver & CB. We wait at the register - as YoYo helps her client and the African American boy helps his client. And we wait. And we wait ... as the red streaked girl goes back to emptying the case!! 4pm EMPTYING THE CASE as if we are not there.  Cream Cheese pounded down - bowls being filled - CLIENTS WAITING!!!  So before we get too angry we grab our order & go to the other register - that handles the Dining Room. We ask \"Mark\"?, the Manager in the red shirt - can we PLEASE check out here because the girl at the Deli is RUDE and not paying attention. His reply is to ask the GUY - who was helping someone else to ring us up. We said NO - Why piss off HIS customer too by leaving there to help US???   We again state the others were RUDE and we would like to pay here... He again asks about the other register - not caring about the complaint we just told him about!! 

SERIOUSLY? We had a $60 order of food & he gives us this crap ?? WHERE IS YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE? Lovey would be pissed. Lou would be furious. We storm out telling \"Mark\"? we will NEVER be back there. 


Don't the employees give a damn? Don't they get TRAINING about Customer Service? NO ONE CARED that we walked out. 
My Brother has been a customer for 25 years - He will never come again. Our associates will never come again. Our family will never return. Our Clients will never come again. Our neighbors...our blog readers, and YOUR YELP READERS will now hear about this. 
Let your staff know that when they disrespect customers THEY TELL THEIR FRIENDS & FAMILY. There is a chain affect in the restaurant biz I learned about when I was a Manager in Chicago at a fine dining restaurant. Where FOOD is concerned people never forget & they are looking for QUALITY Customer Service (as well as quality food).

As you can tell - WE ARE MAD that our once favorite Deli is now off of our list. They need to do something about the Shea location. . You claim to have an \"authentic east coast tradition\". Well that is true because New Yorkers are known to be rude and that is how the staff is, perpetuating that stigma. RUDE."}
{"text":"Fast and great service, atmosphere, and awesome food. I love Chompie's Black and White brownies but they were out of them so I settled for a cheesecake brownie. Good stuff. 

My girl ordered the Nova Lox with an egg bagel and was satisfied. I'm not a fan of Lox so I won't comment."}
{"text":"Love this Chompie's! This is the location where the Man vs. Food challenge took place. The staff is friendly, courteous, efficient and accommodating. The brisket sliders, corn beef hash skillet, original French Toast and stuffed French Toast are my go to items."}
{"text":"Friendly and efficient staff, great food for breakfast, lunch and dinner on top of having a bakery make Chompie's one of my favorites. The stuffed French toast, brownies and corned beef hash skillet are my favorite items."}
{"text":"Always love Chompie's. The staff is friendly and efficient and the food is awesome. My favorite items are the stuffed French toast and the brownies. All of the brownie varieties are delicious."}
{"text":"Been a while since I've reviewed this location. I come here quite a bit and been doing so for many years! I love Chompies! The locations, staff, bakery/deli, and food are A Plus! For breakfast, there are two items I get depending on what I'm craving. If I'm craving something sweet, I get the stuffed French Toast which is stuffed with whipped cream cheese and strawberry jam then deep fried. Unmatched! If I want something salty, I order the corn beef hash with two eggs. It's satisfying and delicious.
For lunch/dinner I can go for the Borenstein burger with bacon and sweet potato fries or the traditional Jewish sliders. Matzo ball soup is great, too. For dessert, I'll go for their 7 layer cake, brownie, or black and white cookie. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"An extensive menu and a diversified bakery give this place lots to offer.  Clean atmosphere, TVs, friendly staff.  A solid choice for any time of the day."}
{"text":"Problem one . . . thought I knew what I was going to order before I got there (snuck a peek at there menu) . . . but the menu was just too larger for me to decide.  With that said . . . I let the person buying lunch decide for me . . . their choice for me . . . the Jewish Sliders.

Problem two . . . they were so good that three didn't seem like enough while I was devouring them.  Good thing I didn't order more . . . after a long conversation catching up with my friend . . . I realized that three was just right.

The food was good and hot, moist and tasty, and the pickles were just enough garlicy.  I will definately be back.

Oh, why not five stars . . . the air conditiong was blasting . . . and even though it is Arizona and over a hundred degrees outside . . . it was darn right chilly inside . . . turn that thermostat up about 5 degrees . . . please."}
{"text":"I'm from Vegas. I saw an episode of Man V. Food about Chompie's, and after I saw the episode, I thought, I MUST GO!!! And I did!  Travel time was about six hours or so. (Traffic, bathroom stops, etc...) We got to Chompie's around 8:15 PM.  I thought this location was open until 10PM, It's open until 9PM and it's inside the mall!!!!! AHHHHHH.  So, we barely got there in time.

What I ordered:  Pastrami Mile high sandwich, extra cole slaw, The father ordered the beef brisket, corned beef sliders... O M G is all I have to say.  I didn't have desert because it was closing time, I took a lot of pics though.  Our server was SUPER nice and helpful.  The people in Arizona are a little nicer than the people in Vegas.  I will make a special trip to Chompie's again without a doubt.

{"text":"I experienced my first \"Chompie's time\" at the Tempe location. A large group of us met up for brunch for an alumni/collegiate mixer, previously arranged by one of the collegiates and this Chompies location. We didn't have to wait terribly long since we had the reservation set. 

There were about 3-4 servers taking care of our entire group, all whom welcomed us as we got seated. Drinks were quickly ordered and provided. Our food took awhile to bring out since they tried to serve everyone at the same time, which didn't happen. 

In the meantime, I kept behind one of the menus to further peruse- holy wow is it expansive with breakfast and lunch offerings! While we waited for food, one of the managers came by and asked us about our fairly large group. Like the service, he was kind and very welcoming.

I ended up getting eggs Benedict with hash browns. I'm a huge fan of their hollandaise sauce plus avocados and the hash browns. Although it was a large portion of food, I managed to eat it all- no shame - since this was my first meal of the day. In total I spent maybe $15 for everything- great price for the time and meal."}
{"text":"Recently had Chompie's catered food for a Seder we recently participated over the weekend with friends.  I decided to try their other items so went there for breakfast after a long night shift on labor and delivery.  Got their bagel with lox on an egg bagel with jalapeño cream cheese.  The egg bagel was soft but mildly bland and the jalapeño cream cheese lacked the infused flavor of jalapeño.  The nova lox portion was small.  Overall, a solid meal but it didn't stand out."}
{"text":"Food is great, and service is usually pretty good. Only reason I'm docking a star is because we called and asked if the patio was open for breakfast and also if it is dog friendly, and we were told yes to both questions. We arrived, and were advised that the patio was closed for breakfast. So my dog and I got to sit outside and wait for 30 minutes while my boyfriend went inside to order takeout."}
{"text":"Place has great food! Service was slow due to how busy it was but well worth the wait.

Highly recommended place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Let me give a brief summary of my review first: 15 dollar sandwiches...  (a la carte)

That's really all I have to say. This place may be delicious, and their sandwiches may be huge but $15 (yes fifteen american dollars) for a sandwich is crazy. You could get full here off of the half sandwich but then again you're already over 10 dollars in at that point so what's another 5 to double your meal. 

Really though, the sandwiches are good but they're nowhere near good enough that I will ever want to go pay that kind of money for one. They were piled high with good meat but I've had better elsewhere for half the price... If they were priced ~10 dollars for a whole and ~7 for a half I would probably come here once every now and then if I was in the mood for pastrami but as is I'll never be back. 

I don't remember the service being anything remarkable either way so I'm leaving that part out of the review as I only did take out. I also hear that they have good breakfast specials so I might give it another shot for breakfast but I can't make any promises as nothing about this place really caught my attention enough to come back."}
{"text":"Roadtripped from Vegas to Glendale for a concert. Had time to kill so we hit the mall. Came across Chompie's on the way out. The bakery caught our eye,but that was just the start. We went back this morning for breakfast and the food was beyond amazing. Being a native NY'er now living in Vegas, I cannot tell you how great it was to come across real bagels and lox. Haven't had a sour pickle in almost 15 years and they gave us a ton to take for the ride home. A+++++++. We'll be back for sure on our next Glendale visit"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Large menu, good selection. We were a party of 4, and two of us had a very bad experience with the food, while two of us were satisfied with the food. Matzo ball soup was good, except for the large chunks of chicken bone in it. The meat on the Jewish sliders, as well as the potato pancakes on the Jewish sliders, had WAY too much salt in them.

Regarding the hostess with the awful attitude that another reviewer mentioned, her name tag said her name was Sara, and her attitude with us was remarkably bad. The rest of my party got there a few minutes before I did. When I walked in, she just glared at me (no greeting, no \"Welcome to Chompie's\", no nothing except for the glare), so I said \"I'm meeting some people here\" and kept walking, her response was a snotty \"whatever\" as she turned her back to me. When I got to my table, the rest of my party was still talking about how rude she was to them when they arrived (we had the audacity to ask for a baby seat, and \"Sara\" was not at all pleased about having to get one). I noticed her crappy attitude with other people as she was seating them too, so she seems to be in need of going back to Hostess school (or being given the opportunity to be successful elsewhere, like a dentist's office where people already expect a painful visit).

That said, our waitress was great: good attitude, helpful, attentive. She did a great job, and her tip reflected it.

In short, I had always wondered what all the hype was with Chompie's. Half of us liked our food, so it's not all bad, and the other diners appeared to like their food, but given the bad experience I had with my food and the requirement to get past the Dread Ogre Sara before I can be granted access to the mediocre food, I'll probably stick with one of the myriad competitors in the marketplace."}
{"text":"I really used to love this place.  My family and i used to come in all the time. The bagels were amazing but they must have changed their ingredients or something because they are awful now.  Nothing like the bagels and bialys i remember growing up as a kid in nyc.  The food is also abit on the pricey side.  It just wasn't worth it in my opinion.  I got a Reuben and it was luke warm and sort squatish.  I really hope they pull themselves up and reclaim their glory days but until that time I'll find some place else for my deli needs"}
{"text":"I'm a junior at ASU and drove past this place on university for THREE years until I finally went in....that was a mistake.  Now I go there whenever I can.   Though while on the outside, it looks like just a chain bagel place, its way more than that.  Chompies sandwiches taste just like (to me) some of the best Jewish delis Ive been to in NYC...honestly, its that good.
     My faves:
         **Jewish Sliders-What Chompies is best known for (as well as featured on Man VS Food for), a very hearty combo of 3 cholla rolls filled brisket, mini potato pancakes & Jack cheese, and a side of gravy. THE BEST Sandwich I have had in Arizona, hands down.
          **The Brooklyner Triple Decker-(pastrami, corned beef, and braised brisket on double baked Jewish rye).  It has it all, the only thing I do to it is ask the server to add coleslaw too it which puts it over the top"}
{"text":"It's been almost exactly two years since I last reviewed this location.  Has there been any improvement?  If fact, yes, enough to bump them up a full star.  Management acknowledged me and promised changes and it was easy to spot them.  Customer service from the staff is tremendously improved, a 180 change from the time I previously reviewed it.  The pastrami sandwich I had was leaner, tastier and overall better.  Chompie's still lacks some when compared to traditional Jewish deli's, for example no \"welcome\" pickle crock (although they will bring you a few slivers of dill pickle if you ask).  No horseradish on the table and the server didn't ask.  The only condiments were ketchup and mustard.  I'm not sure what Jewish food one would put ketchup on. No bread basket featuring several varieties, only 3 very small pieces of rye with my dining companion's meal.  No offer to refill my drink.  Little things like that I've come to expect from traditional Jewish deli's.  So the elusive final star is still out of reach for Chompie's but the improved service and, IMHO, improved food has raised them up.  I mean, seriously Chompie's, how much would it cost you to take care of us with the few simple things I mentioned above?"}
{"text":"Apparently everything my husband has been missing since I took him out of the North East six years ago.  He is no longer allowed to go alone."}
{"text":"I saw it on Man vs. Food, so I had to try it.  But, it was so-so.  I think the food was better than the \"Denny's\" comment below, but the service really left a lot to be desired.  We came in after lunch was over, and I think we got stuck between servers coming and going.  That does not make it alright, but I am trying to be objective.

The biggest complaint - OVERPRICED!!!!  $70 for lunch for 5 is stupid expensive.  The portions are really big, but taking a to-go box in Phoenix in the summer just isn't possible.  I would rather have paid less and gotten half as much food.

As to the sliders - they were good, but a little overrated.

All in all, I went, I don't hate it, but I am not hurrying to go back."}
{"text":"Love their bagels and their breakfast selection. Love that they offer different types of creamers for coffee. Yum!

Haven't been there in a  while and I'm missing it!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, service is excellent most of the time. 
Oftentimes they will bring a piece of muffin or cake by before taking your order. 
Would be an easy 5 stars except for the horrible music they have playing too loudly. Some of the singers sound like a dying calf in a rain storm. And did I mention the loudness. I almost walked out. After another song of bellowing came on I wish I had. 
Turn that stuff down or change it. I live nearby and won't be back without earplugs."}
{"text":"Our family has been going here for 20 years.  The food is excellent.  The ambiance is New York City deli style.  Their breakfast is the best part and especially the omelets.  My wife loves the chicken soup with matzo ball.  Everyone should go here at least 1-2 times."}
{"text":"It really has gone down hill, since they moved to pv mall.  Portions got smaller and prices went up.  If thats not bad enough the quality went down, had a roast beef sandwich that was tough."}
{"text":"Great food - Cruddy service. 3 strikes and you're out. I have experience with Chompie's other locations and have been very impressed with food & service, so I was excited when this location opened down the street from my house. Our 1st two visits we had shockingly bad service. 3rd visit was even worse. There's no $10 sandwich on the planet worth repeatedly crappy service. If you're craving Chompie's drive to Tempe, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"When I get lonely for NY deli,here's where I go . Closest thing to Carnegie deli this side of the Mississippi. Service is spotty."}
{"text":"Food was delish but service was slow yet friendly.  We would go back again.  Easy location near Asu campus"}
{"text":"I love this place! Coming from the east coast myself, (Philadelphia) I grew up going to diners. When I first moved out to AZ three years ago and asked people what the best diner around here was they tried telling me Denny's & iHop. No. These are not diners. There are plenty of breakfast joints in the area, but none that serve breakfast all day. Being a huge fan of all breakfast foods, I love that Chompie's serves breakfast all day long. Going here just reminds me of home and the east coast. Everything is delicious and the staff has always been friendly!"}
{"text":"It was just so-so.  The baked goods are definitely worth mentioning in terms of visual appeal.

Cleanliness just came across as average, pricing as well.  I had cheese blintzes and they were quite authentic and good.  Everything else left a little something to be desired.  Not bad, by any stretch, but not anything I'd want to go back for tomorrow morning either.

Also, as a baseball fan, the omission of Joe DiMaggio from the \"Yankees Greats\" mural in the back room is criminally insane.  Maris?  Please."}
{"text":"5 star Matzah ball soup!   Yum!  Yum!  Yes I asked a customer waiting to be seated if they came here often. She recommended the Matzah ball soup.  Glad I tried it. 

Ordered soup and sandwich. Got their hot pastrami and Matzah ball soup. Yes the Matzah ball soup was good. Huge Matzah ball loaded with flavor. Wonderful broth and some noodles.  The hot pastrami sandwich was loaded but came cold.  Thought that was odd.  So I asked about that afterwards. I asked what hot meant?  Was it hot mustard?  Was it hot steamed pastrami?  Which was it because the sandwich possessed none of this things. I found out the pastrami was suppose to be hot. Management took $7 off the bill.  

This place is busy and features many baked items and other items to take with you (deli).  Looked so good. Too bad we were traveling. 

The bathrooms were not clean. Walls were dirty and the bathroom was not cleaned. Needs painting and bleaching."}
{"text":"I always visit Chompies when I am in Arizona for my annual Spring Training trip.  The menu is huge and the food is usually very good.  I love their potato pancakes and their sliders are also very good.  It's a solid deli and a reliable choice for any meal when in Tempe."}
{"text":"I'm giving it one extra star because they offer gluten free hamburger buns, rolls & bagels. That is a huge plus in my book. I ordered a mile-high turkey sandwich on a gluten free roll and my boyfriend ordered a burger on a gluten free bun (he's not gluten free, but ordered it that way so I could try it too). The gluten free bun & roll are quite small compared to non-gluten free selections. Especially on the burger...his burger patty was at least twice the size as the bun! And we both found the gluten free bun & roll to be on the stale side. They were very crumbly, which is usually an indication that they're old. They make their own gluten free baked goods here which is pretty awesome, but it was unfortunate that we didn't get them fresh. But nonetheless, we were happy with our lunch."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast yesterday morning. They were pretty packed but we were seated quickly. Ordered the hot pastrami with fries and a side of mac n cheese. The fries were pretty good, the pastrami was excellent and the mac n cheese was ok. It was mostly macaroni and not much cheese. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Everything was good till big fish bone scratched inside my mouth. Waitress responds \" yea, we can't get them all out\" and all that manager did is took half off of the price of my dish. Not going to this location anymore"}
{"text":"Other than a long wait to be seated everything is really good. Little bit slow on service but it is Sunday lunch time. Food is delirious . And they do have gluten free options ( a lot of it)"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here to eat. We had been here before but this time the service was horrible and the regular drinks such as Pepsi and lemonade, your paying 3.00 for the drink and they want another dollar for refills. After a number of years of going there, we won't go again."}
{"text":"Having difficult time finding a signature dish for Chompies. Been here several times trying to duplicate a Straw sandwich. Today they have something kinda similar using corn beef instead of pastrami, very little sour kraut which makes the flavorful taste...so too skimpy on their serving.  

Real disappointed I can't find one good meal that brings me back. Then an interesting twist, because it's Labor Day no military discount is offered...what gives?

Well, won't be back...."}
{"text":"I had heard so many good reviews about chompies and their breads and bagels so I decided to give it a try. I had the Reuben with pastrami.  I am a Reuben connoisseur  so I was a little hesitant since most Reuben's are disappointing to me. I started off with the chicken soup with a matzo ball- wasn't impressed. The chicken noodle soup reminded me the same from elementary school cafeteria days. the matzo ball was 'ok' but nothing to be delightful about.  When I received the Reuben I was surprised. It was piled high with pastrami with melted cheese, the right amount of sauce and nicely toasted bread.  The pastrami was done well with little to no gristle string in it. Had very good flavor and like I said... piled high. I ate the whole thing. The atmosphere and wait staff were less than desired. Very drab ambience, not very clean with food stuck to the wall right next to me and other places as well.  The staff looked like they were just there for the pay and didn't want to be bothered to have to seat anyone. After they did they went right back to socializing with each other when the was plenty to be done around that place---  like cleaning it.  If I go out to eat I expect it to be clean like the health inspector is walking in the door in 2 minutes. I should not have to sit and look at dried food and other gross stuff while I am eating.  Good food but everything else is lacking."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food, reasonable prices, love this place.

Huge menu & everything looks good, the hardest part is choosing a what you want. The dishes are large & my wife and I will usually split one which ends up being plenty for both of us. 

Bakery is good & recommend the hamantashen (my Italian grandma used to make something similar & called them \"jelly cookies\"). 

Have not had a bad meal, cookie, or experience here. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Strangely enough we did a take out dinner of a hot pastrami sandwich and a Ruben accompanied by kreplach soup just the other evening. 
Chompie's is one of those restaurants were the quality of the food never changes. It's always wonderful. 
If I can't be in Chicago for Manny's or the Bagel then here I am and Chompie's is my choice. 
What a great restaurant."}
{"text":"All I can say is, do not go there hungry, you will want to eat everything! Also.. Cannoli cupcakes!
Yes, Chompie's had the genius idea of mixing two beloved desserts. As I munched my way into it, I found a splendid discovery that the icing is actually Cannoli filling! Score!
Other than that, Chompie's has been around for years, and boasts a great catering menu. Their desserts continue to look impressive and are not for those who succumb to temptation easily, it's dangerous, believe me."}
{"text":"Amaaaaaaaazing bagels!!!! Sandwiches and just about everything on their menu are to die for! You can't go wrong with any of it! Thank you Chompies for making my days fuller and a little brighter :)"}
{"text":"This isn't the lower East Side of Manhattan or even LA , but for those hankering for Jewish deli in the Valley of the Sun, Chompie's beats going hungry. However, slowly but surely more Mexican and fast casual choices are taking over the menu and the recipes. This place is busy, often crowded, noisy and happy. The staff have never met an old-fashioned Jewish waiter and don't know from kosher, but they usually remember to bring pickles without being asked. Hey, they even have seltzer but can't make an eggcream I'd want to drink."}
{"text":"Chompie's has a ton going for it. They have a stellar bakery (which services a bunch of coffeeshops, restaurants, and groceries throughout the valley with bagels, cookies, cakes, etc.) and fantastic deli food, through-and-through.

Their Mile High sandwiches are absurd. Stacked 6-7\" tall, you won't be able to get your mouth around them. Start chipping away from the side and hope for the best.

Breakfast is typically top notch, if a bit pricey. The pickles they bring out absolutely kill me, but that's because I hate pickles more than anything on this earth. The wait can be really bad, even on a weekday--we were seated instantly, but it took a LONG time for the four of our basic food to come out.

On the other hand, the potato latkes, pierogi, brisket, sliders, roasted chicken, matzo ball soup, and basically everything else is DAMN good. Oh, and their bagels are top notch too.

Grab a butter cookie on your way out, or a \"character cupcake\" done up like a Sesame Street character. (The Cookie Monster one is especially meta.)

Ran by nice people with decent service (when it's not slow), you're sure to get a taste of the classic New York deli right here in Tempe.

Oh, and I'm on the Wall of Shame for failing to complete the terror that is the Slider Challenge. Don't even try it."}
{"text":"Never had matzo ball soup until last year when I attended the UYE here, and now I'm swinging with the best of them.  Cant get enough of that dish (or bowl).  Totally perfect for when you're not feeling so well.  Its even great when you feel fine.

The Pastrami is great too.  My favorite sandwich is their Reuben with Pastrami (you can get it with corned beef).  Their potato pancakes are served with applesauce and sour cream.  I adore them.  And don't get me started on their fantastic Jewish Sliders.

Love Seinfeld?  You'll find many episode goodies here.  Black & white cookies (Look to the cookie Elaine), chocolate bobka (They're going in first with the last bobka), cinnamon bobka (Cinnamon takes a back seat to no bobka)."}
{"text":"I came here with my sister and niece for lunch. It's a Jewish deli and bakery and somehow my sister convinced me to order the turkey dinner instead of a Reuben sandwich, which they are known for 

The chicken tortilla soup was very hearty with big chunks of chicken and fried tortillas. There were also chunks of potato and onion. I'm a huge soup fan, even if it's 105 in Phoenix, and this was definitely tasty  

The turkey dinner was very dry. Since it took a while for the food to come out, I think it had been sitting under a heat lamp. The sautéed spinach was delicious but I enjoyed the latkes better, very crispy with moist inside and flavored with onion and garlic.  The stuffing was dry and the gravy needed some spices. 

My sisters corned beef and cabbage was outstanding!  The meat was so tender and melted like butter. I should have stuck with the Jewish food."}
{"text":"Very good deli, comparable to Cantor's in LA and many of the major Jewish delis in New York. If you watched man vs food he did the Jewish slider challenge, consisting of 5 pounds of food. But there is a smaller size portion on the menu that I recommend.  They have a side bar where you can order drinks and fresh-baked bagels, pretty much anything you want. You can't go wrong you can  pretty much order anything here and it will be very flavorful and large portions totally worth it."}
{"text":"I love chompie's but FYI the arrowhead location opens at 7 am not 6 am like it states on yelp. I just drove 30 minutes here to find that out when I could of went to another location so don't do what I did!!!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant first meal in Arizona! I got off the flight and headed to the first place on my way to my meeting and I founds Chompies. The portions are HUUUGGGEEE! Even their half sandwiches are huge and I was blown away by how good everything tasted.

My team ordered a few sandwiches, some tacos and breakfast items and everything came out beautifully with again HUGE portions. The service was clean and quick and they have a HUGE bakery selection! You get a free cookie when you check in which I enjoyed and the fact that this was my first time in Arizona and this place got me good food got me excited."}
{"text":"I used to go to Chompies for lunch with my friends when it first opened  a tiny little store near 32nd st and Shea. Bagels were cheap sustenance for the high school girl.

I sold their bagels for National Honor Society. They brought in the bucks.

As an adult my dad would take me to their restaurant for big bagel and lox feasts. I would get a zucchini bagel and my Jewish stepmonster would CRINGE. 

I guess zucchini is kind of sacreligious for a New Yorker. 

But I really liked the zucchini bagel. 

This is my proto-type bagel, and that of my highschool buddies. One friend went so far as to ask his wife to learn how to make bagels when the Foreign Service put them in Ecuador, because he missed them so. She's been boiling dough ever since.

If I went to Phoenix today, I'd be there for breakfast in the morning. 

I liked the ruggelach too ( Ok, I can't spell it, but I liked them, a lot).

Sometimes I'd get the 3 salad sampler ( bagel chips with tuna salad, egg salad, and something else.. chicken salad?, lettuce, cucumber... mmm. But a little mayo heavy). 

Potato Latkes? sure! 

Chompies is cool, I know it's had it's issues over the years ( long waits, grumpy servers) but it's still like coming home."}
{"text":"I ordered a very delicious breakfast combo consisting of whole-wheat pancakes, scrambled eggs and bacon. The pancakes are unexpectedly large and the perfect thickness that I liked. 

Aside from the long wait time to get seated, the food was excellent and worth it. I'd probably stop by again and try their other dishes that also looked amazing."}
{"text":"This review is for the deli only.  
Whenever we have family brunches at home we get our lox, kippered salmon, rare roast beef, pastrami, bagels, rye bread, and challah from here. The fish is a little pricey, but so worth it! It is very good. They have a 1/4 lb min on all the deli items.  

Their challah is amazing! It really is perfection! It makes the best French toast...mmmmm. If you want your bagels sliced there is a small fee-we have a bagel slicer at home :). The butter cookies in the bakery are decent, but I've had better-haven't tried much of anything else in the bakery. 

I love that it is family owned and right down the street from me!"}
{"text":"So, we returned for breakfast two days after going for dinner.  (dinner was good except very skimpy on meat for the price.  Three small slices of grilled chicken strips on the salad.  And the manager had to check on us just as we received our meal and pleasantries were annoying.)  

We were curious as its hard to find a decent place where we live that isn't an hour long wait looking at folks finishing up their walk of shame in appearance.  Anyway, we were told 20 minutes to be seated it was about 10 at most.  Nice location we were seated and David was our server.  He was humorous and we even joked about some dishes that crashed in the kitchen of which everybody heard.  My husband and I both ordered the Chorizo and cheese omelet which was wonderful but AGAIN a little skimpy on the meat for the price.  I found the coffee to be excellent and I exchanged my potatoes for a jalapeno and cheese bagel of which was genius in my opinion.  

So, dinner was ok, a little pricey but breakfast was pricey as well, but even more worth it."}
{"text":"Update:  The Chompies in Scottsdale sent us a gift card to apologize for our experience.  That was not necessary although we did accept and we used it last night.  We did go to the location near Chandler mall and had a wonderful meal and experience.  The hostess and wait staff were pleasant and the food was very delicious."}
{"text":"I had forgotten how much I disliked this chain. Fool me once...  guess who is the fool this time?  For the second time I ordered the hot pastrami sammy. This time I had the sense to take it home so I didn't have to choke it down in public. In order to justify $10+ for a half sandwich they give you like 4\" of salty, gristly, fatty lunch meat that doesn't even resemble good New York pastrami. The snarky guy at the counter clearly was not living the dream. When I asked him for light rye he informed me they only had one kind of rye bread. When I read him the three types of rye listed on the big board just above his head he got really pissy. Amazingly, the several large jars prominently marked \"tips\" were empty. I bumped this outlet up to 2 stars because the shot glass sized serving of coleslaw was pretty good."}
{"text":"Needing some great comfort food served up with a smile? Or perhaps some awesome choices for dessert? This is a go to place. Plenty of seating, good service , solid food- sandwiches, salads , soups and sliders are awesome."}
{"text":"I've never eaten meals here but I am here for the black and white cookies!!!!!!!!! Miss these guys and since we aren't in New York, they're the best ones I've found out here so far."}
{"text":"Oh my--this is now my new favorite restaurant here in the Valley! I've read about Chompie's in the past & have been awaiting their arrival in our neck of the woods. We thought we would come early because I had heard it was busy--11:30am was NOT early enough to avoid a 30-minute wait, but it was worth every minute. I had the Jewish Sliders; hubby the liver and onions. We were stuffed & left with a baggie  and no dessert. We will be back---many times. So very happy to have this high caliber restaurant/deli/bakery close by."}
{"text":"Horrible service and not worth the cost. 0/10, definitely don't recommend. Got a full size pastrami on rye bread with fries on the side for a near $18, doesn't meet \"full size\" standards"}
{"text":"Quick review. Want a totally filling lunch? Try the sliders. My son did the latke brisket (thanks to man vs food) and I did New York pastrami, corned beef and Cole slaw. Huge portions that are so good and homey flavored. If you have the chutzpah order the fried matzo balls. No way these are legal!"}
{"text":"Poor service..... Great food but service seriously slow. Took half hour to get our drinks Another half hour to get our food..  another half an hour to get refills."}
{"text":"Nous y avons déjeuner.  Le service était excellent.  Mon assiette Arizona benidict était bonne.  Le bagel sur lequel était l'uf était énorme par rapport à la garniture dessus."}
{"text":"This place got our business simply by default.  We originally had plans to meet friends for weekend brunch at another restaurant nearby.  The first choice restaurant had a wait time of 90 minutes for brunch.  That sadly wasn't acceptable with a small child.  Our friends suggested calling Chompie's to ask about their wait time.  We did so, learned the wait was only 20 minutes and headed there.  On the drive over, I remembered my only other experiences with Chompie's were at their Scottsdale location, and both experiences left me underwhelmed by both the food and the price to value ratio.

Having limitations on our restaurant budget, we like to feel we got real value for our hard-earned money.  Value to us does not mean filling up at the feeding trough that is Golden Corral or thinking fine dining is \"the\" Outback, but we like to feel if we're paying $50 for brunch (WITHOUT alcohol), that it was delicious or unusual.  We could have spent $50 for lunch at Pappadeaux and been completely thrilled.

The best thing about our visit was the nice corner table that gave us plenty of room to be comfortable and enjoy good conversation with our friends.

The food was very lackluster.  Authentic Jewish deli?  Hardly.  Grandma Yetta is rolling over in her grave thinking about their kreplach.  My husband spent almost $15 for the apple pancake with added scrambled eggs and sausage.  I went with a corned beef sandwich, as at $13, it was one of the cheaper options.  We both felt our choices were just meh, the corned beef flavorless and the apple pancake nothing special. Add in a pancake kids meal, 2 soft drinks, tax and tip and we were just north of $50.

Next time, I will have plenty of good suggestions for alternatives that aren't Chompie's.  Sadly, I think they're still impressed that they were featured on Adam Richman's show, which was so 2010....

(By the way, the restaurant has no control over this, but I especially LOVED the table of frat rats kvetching about their hangovers and dropping f-bombs like they were Adderall pills at last night's rager, hello goofballs, there's an impressionable 2 year old boy RIGHT NEXT to you, take your potty mouths back to the dorm room)."}
{"text":"It was not a busy night and the hostess was nowhere to be seen.  Ended up waiting for quite a bit.  The nice lady behind the deli counter sensed my annoyance and seated me.  The waiter brought a small glass of water and a tiny tray of quarter-sliced sour and half-sour pickles.  I really like the sours but not so much with the half-sours.  I ordered a full corned beef sandwich with Coney Island knish (my fave).  The waitress brought my order and I went right into the sandwich.  The corned beef left  something to be desired.  The corned beef was pretty dry so I had to drown the corned beef in mustard to make it more palatable.  The knish was overcooked and slightly burned leaving an off-putting taste, so again the mustard saved the night.

The only highlight of this dinner was a seven-layer cake.  It was delicious.

I was disappointed with their service and food quality.  I don't know if they had an off night.  I am a native New Yorker and have gone to Chompie's quite a few times and normally they delivered."}
{"text":"Those Jewish sliders are to die for. Rich, tasty, crunchy, and filling. I got the standard order with those crazy fries and could barely finish. Adam didn't stand a chance. Definitely would come back. Wait staff was friendly and place was nice and clean."}
{"text":"I think the \"Soup Nazi\" runs the counter service. 

Yes, it's always good to find a good Jewish deli, especially here in Phoenix. And maybe a little big city attitude adds to the ambiance. But is it necessary to provide such rude counter service? Maybe it's cultural? Maybe this place is owned and operated by the \"Soup Nazi\" from Seinfield? 

I tried to place a big order for my mother-in-law's birthday party. I wanted mini deli sandwiches, mixed fruit salad, chocolate covered strawberries, and mini cupcakes. The guy at the counter told me, in no uncertain terms, that I had it all wrong. You don't want mini deli sandwiches; you want whole ones, cut in half. You don't want mixed fruit salad, you want crudité, you don't want chocolate covered strawberries, they're too messy and expensive, you don't want mini cupcakes, and you want a regular sized cake. Really??? Then he quoted me a ridiculously high price. So what did I do? I politely told him that I'd think about it and quickly went to nearby Fry's (grocery store) and placed the exact order I wanted. I admit that Fry's catering food was a (smidgen) below the deli quality. But given the greatly reduced price (half?) and the customer service, I'm gonna stick with Fry's Food Stores. 

Guess it's a good thing I didn't try to order soup for the party. Surely the Chompies guy would have scowled and told me, \"No soup for you.\""}
{"text":"The brunch crowns wasn't as poppin as the Tempe location. I was happy to see that because I was running. Late and it was great that my friend and I didn't have to wait long. I was overwhelmed by all the options, so I told my waiter what I was in the mood for and helped me pic. I was mind blown when he told me that he could serve my cream cheese that had the smoked salmon in it already!!! . Wow. It was delicious.  I wanted to explore the bakery but was way too full. We did get a free black and white cookie with our yelp check in. The over all experience was great. I felt welcomed and treated well. The food was delicious and it was worth it."}
{"text":"My BFFs and I had breakfast yesterday at Chompie's. We had a great time and our server \"E\" (Edward) was fantastic. Engaging, informative and awesome service!"}
{"text":"We came here for the baked goods and I'm glad we did.   Cookies and petitfores were delicious.  Home made taste and artfully decorated.   This place is dangerous for ones waistline but it is delicious if u r on ur cheat day(s)...."}
{"text":"came here for breakfast on sunday. we both ordered from the section of the the menu called fitness bootcamp. i ordered the the healthy choice omelet: an egg white omelet with fat free turkey pastrami, diced tomato, peppers, onions, and lite swiss and mr h ordered the fitness omelet: egg white omelet with diced turkey, spinach, mushrooms, green chiles, and tomato, topped with fresh parmesan cheese. we agreed both were good omelette's. i selected fruit for my side and it did not taste fresh.  i will skip the fruit and go with the home potatoes or cottage cheese next time.  the home potatoes looked so delish. for now i will give them 3 stars because they are kinda pricey for solid average breakfast entree's.  I'll bump them up after i have other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my mom. We ordered the Jewish sliders to share and each got a side item, I got fruit and my mother got Coleslaw. Our food seemed to be taking a while to come out and my mother had gone to use the restroom, she said when she came back to the table she saw our food sitting there, and it was still a few minutes before they brought it over. After we were served and grabbed a slider we looked at each other in confusion because the sliders were almost cold. We flagged down the server and asked if they should be hot, she said that yes they are a warm dish and said that the food had just came up and walked away!  We waited for her to come back around and asked to please take them back and warm them up. I would have thought they would have either taken the fries or served with new \"hot\" fries to go along with the sandwiches. The side of coleslaw is a joke. Compared to the fruit you get for the same price. The sliders are always good, but the temperature and service, is reason for 3 stars."}
{"text":"My friend suggested we meet up at Chompie's early this afternoon. She was craving breakfast and I wanted lunch. The have an incredible menu, it's huge. My friend had the traditional breakfast and loved it. The potatoes didn't look like anything special but she said they tasted incredible. She also loved her bagel, homemade and so fresh. I had the Philly cheese steak, it was so tasty and the au jus sauce finished the flavored perfect. With a side of fresh fruit you can't go wrong. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because waitress brought us some free samples of the pastries and they were not good, very hard. We had planned on grabbing some pastries to go but didn't because of this. However as walking out we looked at pastry counter and everything looked incredible. If they give old pastries away free please don't as this may detour patrons from buying any!"}
{"text":"We came here as a last resort due to a series of events so we didn't expect much. It's not been a great place since they moved from 32nd St. The inside is dark and dingy with a cement floor. They have a rolling bus cart going around picking up dishes and cleaning tables while you are eating. They have a huge bakery with a giant selection of goods but they didn't look fresh. Our waitress was very nice and accommodating but they weren't consistent in service such as with picking up finished plates and filling water. The good was adequate and actually wasn't bad. We tried the cabbage rolls which was a huge portion. Also we had the potato pierogi and fried matzo balls which were pretty good. The pickles didn't taste good and the apple sauce had a funny taste. We tried a bowl of matzo ball soup and a roast beef sandwich which were alright. All in all we can't recommend this place anymore due to the atmosphere and the average food. We think they've got too big for their britches with the new location at Arrowhead and selling their brand in local supermarkets."}
{"text":"I'm not from New York. Never lived in New York. I've visited NYC, however, so I guess that will have to do. I've eaten at Chompie's many times over the years. Always liked it. Never loved it. Have enjoyed some of their bagels and deli meats, but I'm a breakfast guy at heart. On this day our group of six ordered mostly breakfast items, even though it was the dinner hour. That's how we roll. We had to wait about ten minutes to be seated, although the reason for the wait was not apparent given a half empty dining room. Once seated, the pickles waiting at the table were, as always, a nice touch. Service was attentive to start, but then slowed to a crawl as water and coffee refills became an issue. Eggs were served cold, although some other items were served warm. I do like the dangerously heated pancake syrup, but we then had to wait a very long time when we requested more. Overall, the food was fine. We had a nice sampling of items among our party, but there was no \"wow, this is fantastic\" moment.

It's great that Chompie's serves breakfast all day. Unless you need a bagel, however, you might as well go to 5 and Diner across the parking lot. The breakfast food there, while not consistently outstanding, is at least served hot even at odd times of day. I guess I'd suggest sticking to breakfast during actual breakfast hours at Chompie's. My experiences with service then have been better. There's a lot to explore on the menu, so I will no doubt be back.

FYI, the PV Mall Costco, located on the opposite side of the mall, sells Chompie's gift cards at a 20% discount off of face value."}
{"text":"We bought Chompies Cinnamon Raisin Bread at a local grocery, thinking oh yum!  What a disappointment the whole loaf of bread had maybe a dozens raisins, many slices had no raisins at all!  The most any one slice had was three raisins, the bread had no flavor where is the cinnamon, we will never buy it again."}
{"text":"I tried the barbecue sliders which were ok, but the soup was horrid.  I purchased the lace cookies which were over priced and had no flavor.  The raspberry cookie was a litter raw.  The desserts look better than they taste!"}
{"text":"the menu here is just ridiculous... took me forever to decide what the hell i wanted. Endless options(which i love) it's just when you're hungry everything looks so effin' good . Service was great.. there was a little wait..but it was def worth it. I had a really tasty buffalo chicken wrap..Which i ended up taking half home it was a good amount of food. the breakfast also all looked great and b/f really enjoyed his. they really do have pretty much anything you could want also have fun drinks..Bloody marys, mimosas, root beer floats etc. We checked out the bakery and everything looked delicious.  Everything is affordable not overpriced by any means and large portions. Very cool place, love the menu we will def be going back again. make sure to check out the hall of fame/shame to see good ol' Adam Richmond's mug up there from Man Vs Food."}
{"text":"Typically I am not a fan of chain restaurants but I have to say that this place knows whats up. I appreciate their massive portions, specifically the pastrami/corned beef and rye sandwiches. They have a hay-uge selection of menu items which can be overwhelming but it also can be fun to see what you have not tried. I have never been to NYC so I cannot speak to the authenticity of both the ambiance or the food but its hard to find a good pastrami on rye and I would venture to say that theirs is pretty solid - also I think they offer something like 5 different types of rye bread. Breakfast is good, too. I had the Guanajuato Benedict and the avocado Hollandaise sauce was tasty as well as the chorizo. Staff is always friendly and accommodating and I have always had a pleasurable experience here. There is also a sweets counter, bread table, and manager specials happening if you do not care to stop in and eat at the restaurant. I think they also do to-go orders."}
{"text":"Chompie's is one of my favorite places to get breakfast. The Benedict's are excellent. The menu is enormous. I've been going here  for years and have just recently started trying lunch and dinner items. The turkey sliders with matzo ball soup is a great choice. And don't forget to try the desserts. Delicious."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. This spot is always busy, from early morning until later afternoon. They even have a Chompie's Challenge to eat a bunch of mini sandwiches. It has a New York, Jewish deli type feel. I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"Endless options, baked good choices and fun friendly  service. I highly recommend this family operated business that cares about the individual."}
{"text":"All the way around this place is awesome! The menu, the vibe, the authenticity, the food and the service. I'm from out of town and I use Yelp frequently while traveling to find good places to eat with a chill vibe and authentic friendly service. This place has it all! I saw this place while driving to another diner down the street and I will not be back there. This place will be my new home away from home! I had the Lil's Healthy Omelette (egg whites, turkey, mushrooms, onions & peppers), fruit cup and a bialy! BTW, I've never had Apple Cinnamon Jelly and they have it here, delish! Nothing against the other servers, as I haven't anything negative to say about them but Tanya was great! Warm, friendly and very good at what she does! I'll be back for dinner tonight after work and for breakfast in the morning before I head back home to Vegas! Well done Chompies!"}
{"text":"Everything is good. Get there early for breakfasts as there's always a line! Huge deli to browse while you wait. The menu is overwhelming so take your time or get some recommendations from your server. 

Some of my Breakfast favs:

Chompies Benedict 
Bagel Breakfast Skins - the bagel flesh is removed and then filled w/scrambled eggs, chopped bacon, green onions, potatoes, and topped with melted cheddar cheese
Bobka Crumb French Toast is AMAZING if you want sweet this is it!
Corned Beef Hash -- order extra crispy if you like some crunch like I do

All very good!"}
{"text":"Very rude young hostess long like reddish hair, got upset when I inquired about sitting at the round table, instead of rectangular one so my family of 6 could all see each other.. she snatched back the silverware from my 7 year old grandson said  I'll take that and carried it to the round table in far right corner, as she became very annoyed and rude like we were bothering her....I always chose this one over Chandler and now I am done with both..Waiter was nice, but kept having to ask for pickles?, and he said someone was bringing them and once we got the check still never received the pickles I thought this was a deli, LOL first thing given at any New York deli are pickles.. also right before he came w the check at end of our meal I called out to the busboy, he just grabbed a batch of pickles already made in a tray stacked on top of each other eew.. that were there by us entire time sitting there for an hour , when our waiter then said there were none to my face and he must have brought them out just now , I was like NO these were here entire time and I would like fresh sliced only sour that we asked for when first sat down, he just kept responding lies , and he finally said they would get some from back but had one of those 60 minutes show memories of bad things on ones foods so did not even want by then...Also, the chicken noodle soup was so so salty had to put lemon and pepper to offset that taste..and this was from those that like salt !! Brisket and aujus good, rye bread stale, hard and old , coleslaw good , hotdog good .. Experience ruined everyone's time for a return here ..You should highly think of replacing that rude young person as a first point of contact.. Especially if one asks for a different table ..Good luck all.."}
{"text":"So. I used to be a regular customer and had Dave was my waiter. I would wait 30 minutes just to be seated with him, why you might wonder? Well let's talk... firstly he was a genuinely friendly person that became part of our family every time we ate there. He cared that our food came out correct the first time, loved my grand kids and treated them as his own, to which they still ask about him.  We have not gone back since that Saturday over a year ago when I asked to sit with Dave and the girl said he wasn't in today? I was perplexed, as this was a Saturday and busy and he was always there, to which I stated what day was he coming in, and was told not anymore, they let him go!  I was genuinely saddened, as was my entire family to find out that he was no longer a server there, as was many other long timers who were also gone?  Dave was the best waiter, and made all of us, even my picky Jewish mom from Boca... feel at home like in a Brooklyn diner! Chompies food is sub-par but we only went there for Dave, so for them to let go of the best waiter they had, that brought so many customers who enjoyed him, and put up with the food, is beyond me! Also, Dave was such a good waiter that he even made you feel like you had a friend to eat with, when at times I would eat breakfast alone after a good hike.. I miss those days with Dave."}
{"text":"Monster sized servings that will keep them buying to-go boxes. The menu is packed with options, including some traditional deli favorites. The endless pickle platter placed on each table is always a favorite. As a non meat eater, there was only a single sandwich option, but they had a couple good soups to choose from."}
{"text":"I finally made it!  I had always wanted to come here ever since seeing it on Man vs. Food.  Well, my buddy had wanted to try it too, so we decided to have lunch here before dropping him off at the airport. 

I went with the Jewish Sliders, and my buddy went with a Corned Beef sandwich. We also got a \"black and white cookie\" for free with our Yelp check in!  Score!   Here is how the food was.........

Jewish Sliders-  You get 3 of these things, along with some wedge cut fries.  The sliders are actually pretty large!  They are hallah bread, stuffed with brisket, cheese, a potato pancake and some gravy.  You also get a cup full of gravy on the side, too!  The bread was fantastic!  (I have recently started buying Chompies bread in my local Fry's.  The last month or so, they have had buy one get one free sales...score!  It's really good bread!)  The other parts of the sandwich were just so so.  The brisket reminded me of pot roast (If you know me and have read my other reviews, I'm not the biggest fan of \"soft meat\") and was a little too soft for my liking.  The potato pancake was an interesting twist and provided a little crunch and some 'bulk\" to the sliders.  The cheese was barely noticeable, and the gravy was a bit too thick and almost made the sandwich more dry when it should have had the opposite effect.  Was I glad I tried them?  Yes.  Would I order them again?  No.  2.5 stars for these Jewish Sliders.

Black and White Cookie-  This thing is a beast!  They cost $3.75 each on their own, so free with Yelp check in, was a major score!  The cookies were incredibly thick and dry.  Not in a bad way, just not what I was expecting. It was almost like eating a piece of yellow cake with frosting on it.  If I had a glass of milk, I would have enjoyed it a lot more.  On its own though, it was still fine and one of the better items I have received for free with Yelp check in.

Service was fantastic!  Our waiter was on point and very personable and friendly!  My buddy enjoyed his corned beef sandwich and that may be the route I take for next time.  The sliders were just ok and nothing I would ever specifically come back here for.  Cost was around $20.00 per meal with drink and everything.  A little bit steep, but the portions were pretty fat!  Will I be back?  Yeah, at some point but it won't be on the regular rotation."}
{"text":"Meh. 
The server was nice and understood we were in a hurry but everything was under whelming. 
Pastrami tasted more like corned beef, and I don't like corned beef. 
Sweet potato fries were ok but kinda bland. 
Not really worth the hype."}
{"text":"Three of us feasted on the Jewish sliders with onion strings, a pastrami sandwich, a corned beef sandwich (both Ken Witover's), a Philly cheesesteak, and a bowl of Matzo ball soup. Prior to coming here, I didn't think I'd spend $27 for dinner, but that's what it came out to be. Oh well, I think it was worth it.
 
The brisket from the sliders was a bit dry, but the side of gravy helped that out big time. On MvF, the challah rolls looked like they'd be dry and bready, but they were actually really soft, sweet and enjoyable. But my favorite part of the slider was the potato pancake. I'm sure it doesn't hurt that I love potatoes, but these pancakes were crispy and flavorful.  
 
As I ate the slider, I couldn't help but wonder how many I'd be able to eat in thirty minutes. Could I eat 12? The answer is: HECK no. I think I could get to five... MAYBE six, but nowhere near a dozen. I wouldn't even bother trying that challenge.
 
The pastrami sandwich was surprisingly good. If you've been following my recent quest for good pastrami sandwiches, you'd know I prefer thick, hand-carved pastrami, but the pastrami here reminded me of Canter's pastrami in LA... thin (but not too thin) slices of tender pieces of meat with good cole slaw and dressing.  
 
The corned beef wasn't as good though; too dry for my liking. I'd recommend sticking w/ the pastrami.
 
The cheesesteak was good, but it still doesn't come close to the ones in Philly (duh).
 
The Matzo ball soup had more veggies than I'm used to, but the broth was good and I loved the Matzo ball. I think I can eat that every day.  
 
Good food, good service. I'm a happy camper."}
{"text":"I went here last week for the first time for a mid week brunch and the food was great! The menu was huge, filled with endless choices. My bagel was a little on the toasty side but other than that everything was absolutely delicious!

Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. However, one of the hostesses was very rude- couldn't catch her name but she was a very thin brunette. We were originally seated outside on the patio but realized soon enough that it was covered in little ants. When we asked to be reseated inside she rolled her eyes, let out a big sigh and mumbled \"ya\" and pointed to a table (didn't even walk us over to it!) As we ate I continued to watch her mannerisms and attitude with other customers only to find that she was very rude with them as well. She would walk much farther ahead of the guests, turning around with an annoyed glare and stance if they were not right behind her. She never once smiled. Perhaps she was having a bad day but I was still dumbfounded by her attitude and lack of customer service skills. Hopefully management takes notice because there's a lot of restaurants with great food but great customer service is what makes a place stand out from the rest."}
{"text":"After seeing the Phoenix edition of Man v. Food, I thought I would stop by and eat here since I was passing through Phoenix.  Of course, I didn't try the slider challenge but I did order the jewish sliders made famous by Adam Richman.

To tell you the truth, I didn't really like the sliders at all.  I ordered the 3 sliders and my other had the western sliders.  Both of them didn't really have much flavor to it.  I didn't really like the bread as well.  The pricing was also horrendous.  3 sliders for $11?  And not including any sides?  Shall I come again?  No thanks.

The only thing that prevented it from getting a one star is the cookies at the deli.  The small peanut butter filled cookies are delicious!  Pass on the food and just come here for dessert!"}
{"text":"when your sat you get your fork and knife in a paper bag.. no napkins and no spoon? Stirred my coffee with my knife and had to wait for a napkin after asking for one twice. Food was okay...I had the triathlete omlt.. lacking a little flavor but the bagel made up for it. Nothing amazing but good for something different"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place, though when I walked in, I wondered why a restaurant so close to the campus of Arizona State was more than half empty at lunchtime and why so many of the patrons could join AARP. 

The answer became apparent as soon as I got my food: it's bland. 

Portions are generous and everything seems fresh, but it just doesn't have much flavor. I had a pastrami sandwich with sauerkraut, two things not known for their mild flavors, but I might as well have been eating packaged turkey and iceberg lettuce.

My lunch partner's egg salad sandwich was even blander than my food. It looked like the eggs had been all but pureed, like it was slightly lump yellow mustard.

I don't know if someone in the kitchen is on a low-sodium diet or what, but the chefs really need to rediscover salt and other seasonings."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to a Chompie's Deli, only because our first was so fabulous!  The portions are huge and their sandwich combinations are really really good!  The food is always flavorful, abundant, and of good quality. 

Both visits, to 2 different Chompie's, have given us friendly and excellent service. Prices are on the higher side, but you absolutely get what you pay for. 

We would not hesitate to seek out a Chompie's next time we drive through Arizona."}
{"text":"Chompie's was the other half of our Man vs. Food roadtrip we took after watching the Phoenix show. Hopped in the motorhome the following weekend and had a ball trying out some fabulous eats!

Chompie's is a traditional Jewish deli; expensive, huge portions, huge menu and delicious looking pastries.  I ordered a monte cristo, which was fabulous, and my husband had a reuben which he thoroughly enjoyed.  Of course we had to test the Jewish slider that Adam ate on the show, to the tune of $4 a pop!  He had to eat 12 of them in under 30 minutes and after trying 1/2 of one, there is NO WAY I could do that!  It was super delicious but far too filling.  

The service at Chompie's was great, especially once they heard we were doing a Man vs. Food roadtrip.  Our server was attentive and friendly and she even sent the manager over to say hi and we chatted with him for awhile. He very kindly bought us desert and sent us on our way with a huge pack of bagels and cream cheese for breakfast in the motorhome.  The bagels were fabulous!  We had to freeze some and are still eating them."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight.  Service was great.  They still bring out the plate of pickles, but now they also brought slices of challah bread and rolls (the onion one is awesome).

I had the Vegetarian Delight Sandwich.  Very tasty.  The vegetable cream cheese on the sandwich was excellent.  Huge portions.  The tomato soup was good as well, but not as good as the soup at Bravi.

I tasted some of the onion strings.  Delicious.  They had a dipping sauce that was a bit spicy.  It was good too.

My husband got Aaron's Choice - some kind of pastrami/corned beef sandwich.  He liked it, but prefers Miracle Mile.  

Overall a good dining experience, and I got some bagels to go!"}
{"text":"If my Jewish grandmother lost all of her passion for living and then opened up a restaurant, this is what the food would taste like."}
{"text":"We had a fimily affair at Chompies (20 pp) on a quiet Sun. afternoon.  The service was OK, it was a tough crowd.  My 8 yr. old grand daughter wanted a bagel with a slice of Lox on it, I was informed that she would have to order the $12.95 platter.  I said all she wants is a bagel with a piece, was told the owner said not available.  I later talked to the owner and said I should have taken the leftovers home. (Not the point)  I used to eat there for the last 30 yrs."}
{"text":"I love Chompie's  for take out.  Neisha is my girl. 
Food is always spot on.

{"text":"Huge menu with lots and lots of choices that you normally don't see anywhere else. Sandwiches and sliders are amazing! One of my fav places."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. Sliders for the win!!! The Original Jewish Sliders are the bombbbbb! :D (Western ones are delicious too!)"}
{"text":"LOVE the jewish sliders, I get these every time I go here, it never gets old!"}
{"text":"I have been to other Chompies but first time to this location. The food was excellent!!! But... Took forever to make!! (They were slow and we didn't even get anything that was hard to cook- a sandwich and salad). Our waitress was trying her best with asking if everything was ok- but every time she asked- no it wasn't ok- I kept having to ask for things that she didn't bring us- important things like my salad dressing! One of the managers has dread locks (um not professional)! So I'm pretty iffy if ill come back to this location."}
{"text":"the night that preceded my first experience at Chompies was one that I wouldn't boast about; a night where sons forgot about the way their fathers raised them, a night where the bank had questioned whether or not my finances were being exhausted by me or not (I assured them that my $418 transaction was legitimate, I couldn't afford to have my debit card blocked this night), a night where listening to Justin Bieber was enjoyable... I was roaring drunk by 8:30pm and had consumed about fifteen caffeine pills to make sure I stayed up all night. before you begin to judge me let it be noted that I came home early from work the day before to discover my girlfriend of three years laying in my chambers with a man I considered my friend, Adam Levine. I couldn't be completely cantankerous; he is probably the most handsome man ive ever had the pleasure of meeting, I believe I offered him one of my extra tickets to the Cornelius Brothers concert before he had left (he respectfully declined). back to the night... not only was I absolutely intoxicated, but my attitude had reached a recalcitrant level, so much so that I had Stone Cold Stunnered the police officer that was directing us into a cab home. I heard later on that the officer I knocked unconscious was on his last shift before retirement, he had been concussed and humiliated all because of me. When we returned to my home I couldn't fall asleep because of the shame... I called my mother and confessed what I had done, but when I checked my call log the next morning I noticed that I ended up calling my seventh grade math teacher Mr. Dini instead of my mother (the call was thirty-seven minutes long). the morning had felt worse than the night; my mouth begging for just a drop of Dasani purified bottled water to which there were none left in my home. my colleague had mentioned Chompies so we gathered ourselves as best as we could and went mobile. when we arrived, we were told the wait was \"about twenty minutes\" when actually we had only held our horses for eight minutes or so. to my great relief there was water waiting for us on the table when we had been seated; I was filled with delight and my parched mouth was no longer an issue, a tear had run down my face at this point. I feasted on Marks Monte Cristo sandwiches which included the finest Boars Head ham I had ever tasted. the fries were fried to perfection and my much needed water was refilled consistently. it is clear that I will never have another prime first experience like the one I had at Chompies. I had attempted to change my last name to Chompy but the state of Arizona did not approve. if you're in need of an impeccable restaurant there is only one that comes to this careful mind, and that restaurant is Chompies."}
{"text":"Jewish sliders rock and so do their omelettes. The staff here is horrible so dont go if you are in a time crunch. What is nice is the bakery, if you can get someone to take your order at that counter. They have nice cookies including black and whites for the back East crowd. But be warned, everything is very expensive in the bakery, although it is good. I have been here a number of times because its close to work, and it has potential. The truth is it is like a joke without a punchline. You are always slightly unsatisfied with your experience in the end."}
{"text":"C and I met my New Jersey buddy here on a Friday afternoon. 1:45ish. The place was almost empty. I can't imagine people waiting in line here as some reviewers have mentioned. Seriously? Wait in line? Anyways. My buddy gave it a 4 star. His review is around here somewhere. And it does remind me of the Deli's in New York. Well actually, it reminds me of Deli's in a lot of cities. This restaurant is quite large, lots of tables and booths. Also, a large patio. Plenty of seating. Our hostess was pleasant enough. Sat us in a booth, told us who are server would be and headed back to the check-in stand.
Our server was fine. He did fail to mention anything about \"All you can eat Fish & Chips\" on Fridays though. And it was Friday. Hmm. Well, to be fair, he didn't really mention anything other than the standard \"what can I get you to drink?\" We got our drinks and ordered our lunch.
My friend S ordered a Signature sandwich; Times Square New Yorker with Pastrami. $15.99. This sandwich, as shown in the pic is NOT worth near 16 bucks. MAYBE $12.99. And that's being generous. His comment when we were leaving was \"Definitely not worth the price\". Hmmm, yet he still gave it a 4 star.
I ordered a Signature sandwich as well, Wendy's Favorite. $14.99. Now, as you can see in the pic, there was A LOT of Turkey. Over 13 oz. (I weighed the half I took home, 6.6 oz.) Since as you can see it's kind of impossible to eat as it's served, I took one roll of Turkey off and put that in a to-go box. I took the other roll of Turkey and cut it in half and put the sandwich back together with that. Well, I also added the lettuce, red onion rings and tomato from C's Cheeseburger plate which turned it into a nice sandwich. The bread I will say was sad. Falling apart, flattened. Definately nothing special. And what's with the potato salad being served in a little cup? I'm dining IN. Put the salad ON the plate. Oh, and the potato salad. Hard potato pieces, not a whole lot of flavor. Unimpressed. 
As I mentioned, C ordered the Checkered Cab Cheeseburger with Sweet Potato Fries. $8.48. Again, not worth the price. The patty was smaller than the bun which was nothing special, kind of a flattened sesame seed bun. Plus, the kids meal does NOT include a drink. So, add an additional $1.99 for a child's drink and you have $10.47 for a kids meal. How do people with kids afford this place? I didn't realize until after we left that his meal was supposed to come with a Sprinkle Cookie. It didn't. The $2 bump in price for his meal was for the Sweet Potato Fries. They were good and a decent portion. Not sure if they're worth the $2 price bump though.
The total bill for the 3 of us with 20% tip was $59.41. That's almost $20 each. The list of restaurants that C and I could go to for $40 bucks and have a great lunch or dinner is HUGE. Chompies is NOT on that list. 
I love the disclaimer on the Gluten Free menu that states because of the possibility of cross contamination, Chompie's can't guarantee that the Gluten Free friendly items are 100% Gluten Free. So what's the point? I guess \"Gluten Free\" sounds better than \"Maybe Gluten Free\". Do people with a Gluten sensitivity mind playing Russian roulette with that? I assume it's not as critical as a nut or shellfish allergy 'cause that would not be good.

Tip:Kids under 10 eat free on Tuesday with minimum $8 adult purchase."}
{"text":"This place is a fairly good deli, but it is a little pricey for what you get. I ordered the gluten free flatbread which is very small and the gluten free brownie and my meal was around $15. It is nice that they have gluten free options, that's very rare at a deli. I had fine service and very much enjoyed the pickles they bring out."}
{"text":"My breakfast sandwich was very good. BUT; $3 freaking dollars for a piece of bacon on it??  RIDICULOUS!  Since their menu board says .99 cents to add bacon, I questioned the server about it and he came back and said \"That's the way it is and it's ridiculous\""}
{"text":"My new favorite deli. Even better than Sarge's on Third Ave in NYC and that was fantastic."}
{"text":"Food is okay, service is horrible. Servers don't seem to care. Took forever to be greeted and get our drinks. The server broght me the wrong food and by the time I realized. The server was no where to be found.  Had to wave down another server and explain that I had ordered something else. Instead of fixing it right away he had to get a menu and I had point out what I ordered then he went to the server and had to point out to her what  i had ordered. No manager checked up on us and I saw our server only a few times."}
{"text":"Great deli! Had a corned beef sandwich that made me think I was in NYC without the hassle. What a assortment of great stuff. Had a hard time deciding. I'll be back many times on the future."}
{"text":"Best sliders on earth! Ive had both the jewish and the western sliders. The jewish ones are good but the western sliders are fantastic. A great place for lunch or an early dinner. Service can be a bit on the slow side and weekends can get pretty busy but its perfect for a weekday afternoon"}
{"text":"Didn't get what I was expecting. I went back and they gave me the wrong order for the second time. I called to speak to the manager and he was completely RUDE. I'll never come back to this place again. Horrible costumer service!


*sent the receipt through an email as I got told so I could get a refund and never once did I receive my $ money back. This place is such a disappointment!!"}
{"text":"There's something really magical about a genuine Jewish deli. It's huge and filled with great halvah candies and black/white cookies--what's not to love? Their menu, and consequently their portions, is humongous. When I entered the deli, I glowed like a child in a candy store. Substitute candy for grease, of course.

So why the 3 stars? Just like a kid who overdoses on sugar, I certainly got a week's worth of grease in just one bite of my meal. I ordered a Montecristo sandwich (my fav) and they somehow turned it into a cube of oil. My hands were glowing with grease and I could feel my body cursing me for subjecting it to that sandwich.

As happy and excited as I was to enter the restaurant, I felt equally shitty when I was done with the meal.

Distinguishing factor: Menu and portions that will certainly rival your appetite. You won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"For being STARK empty at 8:10pm, it shouldn't have taken until 8:38 for me to get a sandwich and soup to go. Didn't help that they forget to put in the order to actually make my sandwich. VERY inattentive staff for being a not-so busy place. 

As for my food, typical Jewish deli sandwich with toooooooo much meat. Matzo ball chicken soup was good. I'll pass on Chompie's next time. Not worth my time...literally."}
{"text":"So so happy finally Glendale az has a chompies, so delicious just like the Paradise location. Great service and very good all around"}
{"text":"My brother and I decided to come here on a Sunday morning.  In the past we were satisfied with the service and food.  On this day it was a disaster.  Our order was taken promptly, but it took a while to get served.  When the food came it was stone cold.  My brothers meal was also cold but he elected not to complain.  I called the waitress over and lodged my dissatisfaction with a cold meal.  She apologized and took the meal away,  I suspect they nuked it and brought it back,  I ate the nuked version but at this point I had lost my appetite.   As I told my broyhrt, \"looks like no more chompies.\""}
{"text":"Coming from a Native New Yorker...

My girlfriend wanted to surprise me with the start of my birthday week so she planned a surprise visit to Chompie's Deli. She had this on the agenda for some time and was so excited to have finally been able to put it in a day out to the mall. 

I was so excited when we pulled up because she had raved about this place and being I am from New York/ Staten Island, we were both so excited about this outing. 

I will say I am a New York critic to places that say they are \"New York\" so please understand my point of view. If you say your place is based on a place, it should be don't you think? I don't think places should make money off of s theme unless they are true to it.

We don't go out to eat much so the place has to be good for us to go.

My first impression was great with the bakery display of all the \"goods\". I wanted to sink my teeth into \"one of each\" but as soon as the young lady behind the counter spoke, we were disappointed. She lacked any kind of confidence,  happiness or maybe a smile, knowledge of the products or history of this place. I get we all have our days of not doing so good but I could tell this was her personality each day. That was the first impression of the people that worked there. We shrugged it off and went about ordering a corn beef sandwich, fries, cold slaw and pickle (or course). We ordered it to go and was told that we they would let us know when the order was ready. That never happened so I went up there to see if it was ready and they looked at me like \"yes\"? I shrugged it off, took the food and went and sat down. We thought it would be quicker to get an order to go verses \"in\" dining but we were wrong. We should have just ordered it \"in\" and maybe they would know we were here?  We proceeded to share this meal and I will say - the entire meal was great tasting however if I combined the poor service and the over priced meal - I don't need to return again. 

A place of business should never Always be in business just for the money and that's what I felt here. It should be about customer service, quality and price. This place didn't have all of that for me. I will say they pack a very good meal but  shouldn't it be about the over all experience? I feel it should be. I can go anywhere and just get something to eat. I don't mind paying a bit more if I have everything I want in a place.
If I'm not treated well at a restaurant, I just assume stay home. We as customers pay for empoyee's to work correct? We pay their wages so I feel if we are doing that, we should get great customer service. They also get a tip that should be worked for, never assumed. 

PS I also bought 2 poppy bagels for our breakfast in the morning and I don't need to buy them again either. This was not a New York bagel. I couldn't even taste the poppy seeds.

PSS If I would have read reviews before going, I would have never gone seeing a review with a cockroach!!! Yuck!!
I was pretty disappointed. No need for a revisit."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! All the staff members are friendly but I must call out Terrick for being absolutely delightful! Super friendly and attentive, not only to us but to all of his tables. Service like that deserves to be recognized, and I hope his manager sees this! We'll be back :o)"}
{"text":"I had the worst experience at Chompies at PV Mall on 11/11 ordering food to go. 
We've been frequent customers since 2003. But the past year it's gone downhill and each time we ate food at Chompies it tasted mediocre especially for the high prices Chompies demands.  In addition many of the \"old timers\" servers are unhappy and are put out if we ask for extra coffee etc. 
But on 11/11 on my husbands birthday I was desperate for a good Jewish corned beef on seeded rye sandwich and potato salad. 
Recent surgery on both feet 10 days ago precluded my ability to personally pick up the order, which meant I could not double check my order. The bill $34.08 was for one corned beef sandwich and potato salad and one chicken Caesar salad plus tip. (and one side coleslaw and one bagel)
Has anyone noticed how Chompies food prices continue to increase while their quantity of food diminishes???
After explaining my foot situation to the young man who took my order he promised me no worries. I believed him and gave him a tip. 
The food arrives and no potato salad. After all, I paid $15 or more for one sandwich. I was shocked at the small size of sandwich and how dry and. 
tasteless the corned beef was. I also asked for packs of mustard on the side. None in our food order. No packs of mustard   No condiments. Plain, dry tasteless sandwich that at one time 2 people could split and Friday night was barely even for 1 husband.
So.... I phoned Chompies to speak to the kid who took my order. I was put on hold, waited six minute, and no one returns to the phone. I called back. This time I spoke to a Chompies manager Edward.  Edward asks how can I make this situation better?  I told him what you should do is deliver to us the food we are missing and paid for but didn't receive of course knowing they'd NEVER to go the extra mile but rather we should drive back to restaurant and waste our gas for Chompies mistake. I asked Edward if Chompies requires employees to double check orders ensuring that similar situations aren't a frequent occurrence. E.G. Good customer service?  
What gripes me is that Chompies continues to raise its prices to pocket the owners, decreases amount of food, offers poor customer service and owners are indifferent, unorganized. 
Edward offered $15 good credit because they ruined my husband's birthday dinner by not double checking order and also because I was so angry. I told him to credit my card because I'm finished with Chompies but NO I must come into the store and use as a credit. 
Chompies need to go to Tommys Deli downtown and find out what a real Jewish corned beef on rye sandwich tastes like, costs , owners and employees are gracious and friendly.
My son told me tonight his chicken Caesar had a bug in the salad."}
{"text":"HELLO CARB LOADERS!

This is your place to eat all the bagels you want.  What a yum-tastic bagel they serve.  I grew up on Chompie's bagels (this explains a lot).
There is something about the chewy moistness of the inside and the outside that feels and tastes toasted even though it's not. 

Grocery stories sell them now but they really are not nearly as good as the FRESH ones in the actual Chompie's establishment."}
{"text":"I am so angry with you, Chompie's!!!  My sister and I were craving a Chompie's bagel so we swing by the PV Mall location to pick some up.

We were in there for over 20 minutes and exited WITHOUT A BAGEL and without our number being called.  We pulled #29 and it was on #26 the entire time we were in there... And when we would try to ask what was going on, we were SHUNNED!  SHUNNED?  I was trying to ask if we need to stand somewhere specific, ask why people coming in after us were already home eating their bagels.  But I couldn't even get that far.

This Goldstein is going somewhere else from now on.  Well, maybe.... Chompie's Bagels are so good, at least they used to be, I wouldn't know because I never got one!"}
{"text":"Oh Chompies, how I love you. I've been here several times and have never really had a bad experience. Sure, the wait is long-especially if you come here for brunch on the weekend but the wait is totally worth it. And hey! If you have a dog, this place is totally dog-friendly on the patio! :D

The portions are huge! Maybe it's just me, but every time I go I feel like I can maybe eat half of my meal-so you're definitely getting your money's worth. Some of my favorite things to order there are the bagel skins, tuna melt (rye and swiss-best evereverever), and the french toast. I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here. 

The only qualm I have is when I come here for brunch and order a mimosa. The so-called \"large\" mimosa is a joke. It's a regular size drink you'd get anywhere else. 

Overall, a great spot to grab breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"I love Chompie's deli on Shea rd., Scottsdale. I drive miles for their cinnamon Rugula's. I buy them for myself and send them to friends. Their sandwich's are huge, their corn beef is great as well as the pastrami. They are always busy, so they must be doing something right. Morning, noon or night. This is the place to go. It's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Just OK - The food is pretty good but it is somewhat over priced in my opinion."}
{"text":"Not great compared to a good deli, not good when you factor in the price.

It was soon after moving here from Los Angeles that I found Chompies.... being a regular patron of West Coast heavyweights such as Langers, and even Canters, I was hungry for good deli food and thrilled... at first.  

Their food is \"meh\" at BEST and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY overpriced for the quality.  If they charged 1/2 the price they do currently, this place would be 4-stars.. but don't come up in here trying to charge Langer's prices and serve up Schlotzsky's quality. 

Next."}
{"text":"So far I have only been to Chompie's for breakfast, but everything I have tried has been great.  The fitness omelet is amazing!  I also thoroughly enjoyed the potato latkes and on a third visit I treated myself to scrambled eggs and bacon with fruit.  I have also managed to snag bites of the eggs benedict, corned beef hash, french toast, chicken and waffles and pancakes.  They have yet to disappoint.

Now I need to come back closer to lunch time so I can finally try their mazah ball soup.  It looks delish!"}
{"text":"Update:  mistakes happen....but it's how you recover and follow up that builds loyalty.  Thank you to the folks that followed up, listened and recognized the wrong (or at least the confusion).  I appreciate that you made my concern your concern .  Thank you.  Look forward to coming in soon.  

Oh Betsy.  Would have liked more pricing information (like you charge by the person and count a 4 year old the same as an adult) and confirmation regarding how many people would actually be eating the lox.  Especially since I ordered additional items for people, but you still priced them in the \"total count\". Then when I see the platter is amazing that it for \"11 people\".  Had a similar platter for 4 people before (gifted to us, so not sure how they were charged....but would guess $80).  Would love to see an explanation on how they prep/portion the tray by person (since they price by person). Will post the picture. Didn't appreciate my conversation with one of the \"managers\" either.  I'll be contacting upper management for all this and more feedback.  Happy Mother's Day to the chompie corp"}
{"text":"Honestly I wasn't too impressed with the food. Someone told me that the sandwiches were awesome especially their chopped liver. Firstly the menu is just humongous it took me a good 10 minutes just to scan it. On finding the chopped liver sandwich I ordered that but made the error of asking the waitress for the accompanying bread (which she suggested as rye). SO I ended up ordering the half chopped liver with rye.

The chopped liver was piled quite high but the sandwich was quite small for the 7 bucks. However I like small portions so this didn't bother me too much Mimi's across the 101 serves similar portions and I don't ind paying for it. However the combination of the sweet rye and gamey chopped liver made the sandwich rather disgusting.

Next time if I go back I'm, getting the corned beef with challlah or onion pocket."}
{"text":"This particular location isn't as busy as the location in Tempe. Why that is, I am not sure considering it is sitting across the street from the mall.

Over all the food and service is very good. Very attentive and food is HUGE! No matter what you order, it's tough to finish.

Bakery has a lot to offer anyone who comes in. Bagels are fresh in the morning, but I would not recommend purchasing after 11AM.

The cream cheese is awesome, which we brought home tonight."}
{"text":"My husband and I were highly dissatisfied with our experience at Chompies at Paradise Valley Mall. 

For starters: Their bagels and cream cheese are delicious. So many varieties and this is why I am giving 3 stars. 

Why I am giving Chompie's ONLY 3 stars: The dining area is not only confusing, but also frustrating. It's crowded and there's not much of a \"flow\". We didn't realize that we ordered from the \"to-go\" line and were originally told we were unable to sit in the dining area. We ended up sitting on the patio. After all the Huss and fuss to get our food and a seat we dug in... but, only to realize that not only was the overpriced bagel sandwich expensive, but it wasn't anything to \"roll your eyes in the back of your head\" for. It was very underwhelming. 

I will be back for bagels, but not to dine."}
{"text":"First time ever to Chompie's. I feel its the land of the \"old waitress\". The puffy hair and hairspray almost had me in tears LOL. 

Had the pancakes - weak and not even fluffy at all. Two ppl i went with had good meals. 

Service sucked, place smelled real bad."}
{"text":"I have been to this Chompies many many times and it is always alright, not the best Jewish deli food, but solid. I went there this morning to pick up a couple of bagels and they were good. They have a good consistency, but I've noticed the last few times I have been there and gotten everything bagels, they don't have much in the way of toppings.... not like most everything bagels. I think this location is my least favorite as they have restricted hours and the food doesn't measure up to some of their other locations."}
{"text":"So I have been to all of the other Chompie's, and I must say that this one is the nicest looking one. I went here this morning with the BF and a couple of our friends for breakfast. So the coffee here is just as atrocious as at the other locations.... it is so bad. Normally I can drink a cup of coffee with only half a creamer, but here I put in two creamers and it still tasted terrible. I tried something new today and got the Cabo skillet. It has home fries with bell pepper, onion, jalapeno, cilantro, green chilis, new mexican chili, tomatoes, and scallions in it. Then they melt jalapeno jack cheese on top and put some slices of avocado on that AND it has two eggs on top which I ordered over medium. This thing was good. I mean super good! It was just the right amount of spicy, it did not need any salt and pepper (and I love salt and pepper on my eggs) and it did not need ketchup. It was pretty wonderful and huge, I couldn't eat it all. This is definitely the best thing I've ever had at chompies. Oh, so it comes with a bagel on the side, and mine was a little burnt.... but normally the bagels here are pretty good. The BF got biscuits and gravy and thought they were a bit too sweet, but I don't know about that because I don't like biscuits and gravy and didn't taste it. Our friends got a different skillet and an omelet of sorts, and both said it was really good.   Overall, this was a Chompie's win, especially in comparison to the last few times I've been and it wasn't so good. 

Also, bring back the Lovie's difficult decision! That was the best thing ever! (a piece of kugel, a latke, a blintz, and a cup of matzo ball soup.... all of my faves on one plate.)"}
{"text":"Perfect way to start Christmas morning!  Pastrami on a Sesame Bagel. The pastrami was moist and lean. Great service!  Hats off to Chontez and Saul for taking care of us!"}
{"text":"I love Chompie's, but then again I am a sucker for a Monte Cristo sandwich and bagels.  I have been to this location twice now since I finally found somewhere besides Disneyland that I can get a Monte Cristo.  How can you not love this deep fried goodness dipped in a strawberry per-serve? Its huge, and its yummy, but I recommend sharing it with someone or you will regret it!  Haven't really had much else on their menu except just a breakfast bagel sandwich which was good also. Service is ok, but I don't expect much when I am at diners, I know I am not going to get 5 star service, so I usually don't get disappointed.  Their kids meals are great, and my son gets a huge cookie when he leaves, he loves this."}
{"text":"First time here and we had heard great things from friends about their breakfast. 

My meal was pretty cold when it arrived and cold hash browns really don't do it for me! The poached eggs were perfect and the wholewheat toast was unusually good but to eat a meal that is half the right temperature and half cold is not great.

Service was very friendly and coffee refills came quickly and without asking which is always appreciated.

Unfortunately breakfast joints are pretty much everywhere in Chandler so when you have such a choice an experience like this is not going to make me come back."}
{"text":"Must stop when your in the area.  Great atmosphere excellent food,  and if your really really hungry make sure you try the man vs food challenge."}
{"text":"Finally a good restaurant & deli at arrowhead where miracle mile deli use to be. We had chicken sandwich and breakfast sliders yum yum! ! Then we got some baked goods to go, love it."}
{"text":"I spent one Friday night in Phoenix and when my friend suggested eating here I was excited, because I love chompies. Sadly, this did not live up to previous experiences at other locations.

My daughter ordered a bowl of the matzoh ball soup, I got the roast chicken dinner and my friend ordered the pastrami sandwich and specified that she wanted to pay extra to get it extra lean. 

Problem one - they were out of matzoh soup. At 6ish on a Friday night. When our server brought me my salad he said that it would just take a couple Minutes for them to heat some up. So does that mean that they were defrosting previously made and frozen? That's a no. Plus it wasn't a couple minutes. It was closer to 20. From when he mentioned it, which made it around 30 minutes total. 

Problem two - my chicken was DRY. The mashed potatoes were basic. 

Problem three, which was biggest - my friend did not get the extra lean meat she asked for. The manager came over and very rudely told my friend that he and the chef had taken apart the sandwich in the kitchen and felt the meat was fine and she needed to order something else because he didn't want to make her another sandwich for her to refuse. My friend commented on how it was fine for regular but she had asked for extra lean and had been willing to pay. The manager agreed it hadn't been that and said he would make that, but no apology for their mistake or his initial attitude. When he brought back another sandwich Itnwas only slighter better.

I'm only giving two stars instead of one because of the server. Even though my friend was obviously unhappy and I was annoyed by my daughter not getting her food in a timely manner, he kept coming to check on us and stayed nice. A lot of servers would have assumed they would get screwed on tip so not bother or just been to afraid to come by but he didn't. And he offered us comp dessert as an apology. My daughter got a hamantaschen and was thrilled."}
{"text":"Have had a great experience everytime we come. Food portion is huge and really delicious! Even the kid portions are big. We usually get sliders and any of the sliders are yummy. We especially enjoy their Jewish sliders. Service has been decent the times we have come with food coming out in within 10 minutes or so. I definitely recommend trying this place out"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly awesome. I'd never been here, and bought a groupon on a whim. A buddy from work came with me, and gave me the rundown. I thought this place was like Blimpie's (yeah, that old place). It's not.

We sat down, my buddy ordered a half sandwich with fries, and I went Breakfast (heck yeah, all day breakfast!). By \"breakfast\", I mean Chicken Fried Steak with Gravy, Eggs, Hash Browns (really good), and a blueberry bagel (choose the bagel here, it's awesome).  Our big worry was that we would end up late for our meeting after lunch, but they got us our food pretty quickly.

The Half Sandwich was pretty much the size of a Toddler's head. The meal in front of me nearly made me nod off in the aforementioned meeting, being so huge and delicious. That sausage gravy set the whole thing off, and the bagel ended up a nice dessert.

After that awesome meal, we ended up only a dollar over our 20 dollar Groupon (both went with waters), and got back in time for our nap... er... meeting."}
{"text":"We eat here regularly and always enjoy the food. Had breakfast this morning. Husband ordered a Kleo (sauteed kale, Nova lox, scrambled eggs and onions) and I got the Chompies Benedict. Both were very good. Had lots of decaf coffee. My only complaint is that the coffee often is not very hot. Kudos to our waitress who went to the kitchen herself (because they were being a little slow) and prepared my husband's food. Kudos to her!!
Hint: The Chompies on University in Tempe is actually our preferred location - more reliably good."}
{"text":"A favorite go to deli  for a power breakfast. Usually get the daily two egg special with abundent potatos, bagel with cream cheese....no need for lunch after that feast. Service is good and plenty of selections anytime of day. They have a large bakery and takeout area. Coffee is good although I can't get use to the decaf taste."}
{"text":"We absolutely love coming to chompies! Some good food and great service. We would love to give a shoutout to Ashley H. for being super informative on the wait time for food and always attentive! Great service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"We went there yesterday and it was awful. There were some people who work there putting silver ware into a bag ready to put them on the tables. The one lady was coughing into her hands, picking her teeth and wiping her nose on her hand, then putting the silver ware in bags without washing her hands. We complained to the manager and her said that he would talk to her. He went over to her and was laughing and joking with her. We will not be going there again that's for sure"}
{"text":"Down right love all the food! The best bagels in town! Their chocolate dipped butter cookies are seriously addicting! The establishment itself could use a little updating and love, some of the employees are not the most friendly in the world. But overall a good staple in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Excellent hot pastrami sandwich on marble rye and the pickles were excellent! We brought home some butter cookies - yummy!"}
{"text":"The first visit to Chompie's was great!! Service, atmosphere and the food was great. However the second visit was terrible. Service and atmosphere were still great, food was terrible!! I got the soup & 1/2 sandwich combo. The chicken soup is really good but the corned beef sandwich was horrible. The crust on the bread was so hard I was afraid I would break my tooth so I spit it out. The corned beef was so fatty. I asked for more bread and they brought me 4 slices that were warm and the crust felt hard. It's like they microwaved the bread to long. The server told me they had many complaints on the rye bread. Really, they have complaints and do nothing? I gave up on the sandwich and brought home the corned beef for my dog. I then sent a email on Chompie's website which stated they would reply within 24 hours, well it's been a week and no reply. Guess they don't care. Won't go back, much to my dog's disappointment, she was the only one happy."}
{"text":"We hadn't even gotten our chow when I decided this place was, at best, a 2. Why? Marginal service and marginal food

PROS: the bus boy was busting his hump and doing a damn good job

CONS: food was on the tail end of warm. How does this happen in a place 10% full at 0730 on a Thursday?  Service was less than pleasurable: our waitress exacerbated a sour experience by coming across like she wished she was somewhere else, far away. Anyway, she arrived about 5 mins after we were seated--it's a workday morning--I want to eat and go!    Drink order is executed and another 5 mins passes. It's coffee and a soda, not fresh squeezed kiwi juice--why 5 mins?  We finally place the order, and our server stops at 4 tables to refill water, bus table, and take an order. Hey! How about getting my order in the system? \"Crispy bacon, please!\" was a bridge too far; sausage links didn't even get to the warm category, as the first bite led me to question if the sole grill mark was an act of cosmetology or a malignant omen.  Come on, really?

I've done Chompies 3x, all for bfast, primarily due to convenience of location to ASU. Each time the chow is no better than average, service just an okay. Today, Chompies failed me. 

I won't be coming back.

Cheers!

{"text":"WORST BAGELS EVER!!! Usually go to Einstein's but they were closed so figured I'd try \"Best Bagel in AZ\"........  NOT!!!! Paid $15 for a dozen of hard, dried out, STALE grossness!! A few seconds in the microwave didn't even help!!! Here's some advise CHOMPIE'S, look up the procedure for QUALITY CONTROL TESTING so you can throw out potentially a good product BEFORE it turns to crap and then sell it to a customer!"}
{"text":"When can I come back!  Wish I'd had more time to try dessert. This is better than Max's chain of Jewish Delis in California.  Huge portions from extensive menu of all your favorites.  Half sandwiches available.  Corned beef prepared onsite and bread baked fresh daily, including double baked & swirly rye."}
{"text":"Outstanding authentic deli food. Breakfasts are good - especially if you ever crave real blintzes. And their sandwiches are amazing.  Today i indulged my regular craving for one of their NY pastrami sandwiches topped with coleslaw and 1000 island dressing. So good!  May not be the best deli you have ever been to, but if you ever crave authentic NYC/east coast deli ... You will love this place!"}
{"text":"I miss so much food from NYC and take comfort in knowing that Chompie's can always offer me an authentic Coney Island Knish!"}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent. The choices are endless and portions are unbelievable. We split the Jewish Sliders and still took over half home."}
{"text":"Triple D brought me to this restaurant, and told me to try their sliders, which I did. First, the restaurant has a lot of space on the inside, even though it doesn't look very big from the outside. The staff seemed pretty adequate, but I was sort of disappointed on my food options.

There were these hushpuppy-like appetizer things that we tried that were breaded on the inside, and they were a little bland, but the dipping sauce made up for that for sure. I think they're similar to cheese-filled wontons, but more breaded.

I had the ham sliders with fries for my entrée. They were actually good when I tasted them. I wasn't expecting them to be that good based on the presentation. This, however, is a healthy meal and a good choice if one is not planning to eat a ton of calories. I would say that you could make those at home too.

They also offer dessert, but we didn't have any. I did enjoy how this restaurant looked on the interior. It reminded me of an old school diner sort of place. I would definitely come back and try something else if I ever make it back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite go to for bagels and/or deli - bar none.; always friendly staff regardless of what you order. Would be nice though if someone figured out to buy them a bagel slicer so when a schleb like me orders 4 doz bagels it does not slow down the others behind me. Nonetheless always a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch today...had the Biltmore Benedict.
For those of you that don't know its a spin on the traditonal bene. It's lox & sauted onions instead of ham.
The portion was huge. I chose home fries but fruit is an option. I wanted something different and i got it. It was hot and flavorful. This was my first visit and headed in with a Reuben in mind but breakfast is served until 3pm.
Thier claim to fame is NYC deli foods/bakery.
My server at the bar was friendly and effecient despite waiting tables as well. Pricing is moderate. I can only give 3 stars having only tried 1 thing 1 time but will go back."}
{"text":"Thank you to Germaine and also Adam for your excellent service.  You won't believe this but Germaine took my holiday order without even getting my name.  He untuited.  He knew  I was was desperate.  for Jewish food! Love you!"}
{"text":"I came here a long time ago when I was an undergrad, and I remembered liking it, but that was before I knew about Yelp.  Luckily, I swung through on Super Sunday to reminisce about my (recently) passed college days.

A group of friends and I (4 total) rolled in to grab a quick breakfast.  They have a counter besides the sit down area where there is a \"Rush Hour\" menu.  \"Rush Hour\"!  That must mean they get that shit ready fast!  Or it's for pairs of Asian and Black detectives?  We guessed the former.

So my friends and I each get a bagel sandwich.  Nothing very fancy.  It was like eggs, some veggies, and a little meat in a bagel of our choice.  No sweat, right?  It really wasn't even that busy in there (no line, everyone getting seated immediately).

So we sat.  Wandered.  BS'd.  Ogle'd a couple hungover girls stumbling in.  Normal stuff.  But we didn't see shit going on.  Nobody looked like they were preparing out \"Rush Hour\" sandwiches.  We waited.  We pinged the manager, and he said they would be on their way out.

After a half hour, three of the sandwiches came out.  Of course, my sandwich wasn't ready.  Must have been chopping up all those bell peppers...those little guys are so tough!  Or perhaps they were curdling the cheese as I waited!  5 minutes later, my sandwich got there.

My friend brought up the fact of how long it took to make.

Pat: Hey, what's up with taking over half an hour to make these simple sandwiches?
Manager: Not really, it was like 15 minutes.
Pat: No, look at our receipts.  They're timestamped.  Look at the clock now **It is past 1/2 hour now**
Manager: Ok.
Pat: That's it?  What kind of response is that?
Manager: **no response...perhaps thinking about how he hates life?**

And that was it.  And the sandwiches sucked.  And they gave us the wrong bagels.  Awesome.  And them damn things cost like 5 bucks.

In summary:
-\"Rush Hour\" menu is bullshit.
-Can't get basic orders right.
-Manager's a jerk.

I can't speak to how the sitdown area is.  I enjoyed it a long time ago.  But I wouldn't ever go back with what a letdown this past experience was.  Even if the manager had said \"Sorry about the wait\", I might have wanted to come back.  I wouldn't even want my money back.  But he basically was like \"What the fuck is your problem?\""}
{"text":"I want to love this place, but I can only partially commit. They have amazing pastries and bagels, but their overall menu leaves much to be desired. The home fries are always soggy, and they eggs always runny. Their portions are so large, I'm not surprise that they are not cooked properly.  They are always packed, and seem overwhelmed by the amount of guests they have seated. The heavy traffic makes for bathrooms that seem like they should be at a street festival or state fair.

I recommend grabbing your baked goods or bagels and heading home to enjoy them...far from the chaos and grime."}
{"text":"First time there. Had the mile-high pastrami. It was very good. I had it on a challah roll. Was not all that impressed with the bread. Don't get me wrong it was good, but I kind of expected great. The potato cakes were disappointing. The prices are a little bit on the high side. The sandwich was quite good regardless of the bread choice I made. I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Chompie's has the largest serving sizes around!  And a huge menu with ample variety. Their staff talks to you like you're family and always make you comfortable and are tuned in to serving you. The locks bagels are my favorite go to.  It's a little pricey but the serving sizes are worth it!"}
{"text":"Good service, but not the best A/C it's pretty warm. SO got the pancakes, said they didn't clean the grill because he kept finding bits of stuff in the pancakes. Pepsi products is a strike against them for me. I got the Reuben, pretty good except I wanted pastrami and they gave me corned beef. I forgot to say but waitress didn't ask. Also booths are really short, uncomfortable for me (5'9\") and torture for the SO (6'3\"). Overpriced a bit. Probably will not return except to the bakery/deli."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Chompies in awhile but I had a craving for lox, onions and eggs so went there yesterday.  OMG it was the most delicious platter of food I could have imagined.  Came with huge serving of crispy hash browns and a bagel of choice and cream cheese.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is our 3rd chompie's that we've eaten at and it was pretty nice to be in such an open space. The other's are also set up to be wide open but for some reason this one seems less cluttered.  Food was good.  Only thing I have to say negative is that I had to use the restroom and it was a mess and the place was fairly empty at 3:30, yet all the employees seemed to be sitting at the front desk chatting rather than checking the various messes."}
{"text":"food is definitely NYC worthy.  the menu is so huge.  usually waitstaff is pretty good.  better, for some reason when they're busy!

I like that they have their fitness menu-especially the new bagel skins at breakfast!"}
{"text":"waitress was good, food was good-but honestly, the bakery/deli person was not helpful in the least and was rude.  left there being treated as if we were a bother to her day.

we usually go the one in PV mall, but I had a medical procedure just up the block-so we gave it a try."}
{"text":"Service is always really good. We usually go for dinner and they always are friendly right when we walk in. The food is always good and feels like they take pride in everything they make. They are always check on you and refilling your drinks even before you ask. Would recommend this place to any one that enjoys food and especially pastrami sandwiches."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great NY deli & bakery in Phoenix, look no further than Chompie's.  Amazing selection, freshness, big portions, good value, and friendliness are their strong suits. They serve breakfast all day and their menu is huuuuuge - so hard to choose from so many great choices!
I've been to Chompie's quite a few times now and have no complaints, so 5 stars! Usually, we just pop in for a bagel and cream cheese (HUGE selection of both) or get a sandwich to eat at the 'self-serve' counter. I love the bagels - just the right east coast texture - and the strawberry-almond cream cheese is wonderful. 
We've sat in the restaurant twice and the service is always quick and friendly. They are famous for their sliders for a reason. Mini challah rolls with lean brisket, mini potato pancakes, jack cheese, gravy, topped with fried onions - this is great comfort food. 
Biscuits were so light and taste homemade and their gravy is very good. French toast w strawberries didn't disappoint. 
I look forward to working my way thru the menu and the pastry case. Now, if I could only finish my plate one of these times..."}
{"text":"The wait for your food is a bit long, but I'd say it's worth it! The menu is overwhelmingly huge! My boyfriend and I tried the fried Matzo Balls appetizer for the first time yesterday and loved it! I had different omelettes that last two times I was there and had to take leftovers home both times. We always leave Chompie's satisfied and will certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm very surprised at the average low rating this place gets.  I say \"low\" because this is the only place where I can get my Jewish soul food fix West of the Mississippi.  It's ironically not Kosher, yet the Jewish Sliders are sinfully amazing!  I can't get anything else except the Jewish Sliders."}
{"text":"WAAY too over priced. the roast beef dip is disgusting and I would highly advise anyone planning to go here willing to spend $20 on a sandwich not to get it."}
{"text":"+Chompie's has a great location because it's one of the few quality restaurants in the area
+Chompie's has the BEST bagels. They are so fresh.
+Service is always great
+Extensive menu
+Unique food! Where else are you doing to get a plate of jewish appetizers?

-Salads are super pricey. Like $5 to add chicken? Really? I could go to fryes and buy 2 pounds of chicken for that much.
-A lot of entrees are kinda pricey
-Coffee is AWEFUL. It gives the new York theme authenticity, but seriously, SO. BAD."}
{"text":"Every since I saw this place on Man vs. Food  I wanted to go there to try the jewish sliders, and I tell you it was worth the wait great tasting sliders and I recommend the sweet potato fries I also got a order of the turkey sliders wow they were so good, it was like having thankgiving leftovers they even put in cranberry sauce on the challah roll. Had great service and a awesome bloddy mary."}
{"text":"In general, just a great NY style deli experience. I wish they would open in Boston,. Haven't been in years but went this week. Despite having an air head for a waitress you cannot beat the sandwiches, the depth of the menu and the quality of the food. yeah, sandwiches are 12 bucks or more, but you can get a half. The pickles are great. Soup in good., desserts are good. yummy yummy yummy."}
{"text":"Terrible service at the bar, manager lacks customer service skills and hostess knows nothing apparently because after having called to make sure restaurant was pet friendly and told yes, we took our pet and then while waiting for our food were told if it wasn't a service dog, we couldn't have it there. I'm sure if our group was Caucasian we wouldn't have been treated the way we did. Suck it!"}
{"text":"The bagels are good. My family and I gave this place many chances with the restaurant section. The food is soooo plain tasting. Breakfast is so-so. But the soups etc plain, how can chicken soup taste plain with no flavor?"}
{"text":"went in for liver and herring for the holidays.Also some bagels. It was almost like I was being punked  as everyone ignored me. After painful begging  my friend and I got the holiday stuff we paid and went home. (Ok...no one there is at all friendly. Not helpful. The girl checking me out mumbled so badly we could not understand her. She then said something rude as I did not respond correctly to her mumbles..LOL)
....got my bagel box home and someone screamed...look at this 13 perfectly uncooked round balls. Slightly brown on the top and you could put your finger through the center.Now in the trash..
no response to my email to the company. Oh I know I should have returned them but an hour to Shea to be treated rudely was not happening.
Never will go there again. Zero stars...one to get on but you know it is zero"}
{"text":"Love Chompies, been going for years and to multiple locations. Celebrating Father's Day early (on 6/17) and service was poor. Took away a little from the experience. Service just wasn't up to par, slow service, forgetful even just bringing a different creamer and a coffee for my dad was so slow he could have reached over his shoulder to get the pot if he had a cup. Waitress had no enthusiasm or desire. Food was on point and portions were generous. American Breakfast was filling and required a to-go box. Will be back...visited after 10a on a Saturday"}
{"text":"The worst garbage iv ever eaten the service is slow and the food is horrible nothing at all like a New York deli or any deli for that matter really really bad"}
{"text":"We were very excited to go to Chompie's at Arrowhead Mall.  They weren't busy when we got there yet it took several minutes for us to be sat.  Once seated we saw no less than four different wait staff wonder by, yet none of them ever acknowledged us.  We left after 10 minutes of being ignored.  The hostess did or said nothing to us as we left.  Not a good first impression."}
{"text":"Food has gone downhill. Our food came out cold.  I ordered a half hot pastrami sandwich and soup.  The sandwich was cold and the soup was lukewarm. My husband ordered Eggs Benedict, which is served over a bagel.The bagel was not toasted.  The poached egg was overcooked. The grilled ham was really salty. The hollandaise sauce was sprinkle with cheddar cheese...hmmm....never heard of cheese on a Eggs Benedict.  Chompies definitely needs some improvement."}
{"text":"Wow. What an excellent breakfast. I had Van Wyck Expressway skillet and would have licked it clean if it was socially acceptable. Wife had Blake's Cheese Blintzes (one cheese and one blueberry). She stated it was perfect. My sister had Granny Girls skillet, cleaned it up.  Mom had the breakfast of champions (scrambled eggs and pancakes). Very fluffy pancakes and moist eggs.   

Wait staff was friendly and attentive (nice job Tracy R.)

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped into Chompie's for breakfast this morning. Chompie's definitely has a wide selection and looks like a solid delicatessan for lunch and breakfasts. In terms of take out, a solid choice for a tasty bagel. The bagel breakfast sandwiches on the other hand need some work. I orderered a parmesan bagel, ham, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich. Bagel was awesome and one of the best Ive had and the sandwich was definitely tasty, however was sitting in a PUDDLE of oil. Not necessarily the easiest thing to eat on the go. Coffee was bland so I would skip that in the morning. I didn't try the baked goods, but they looked DELICIOUS! I am excited to try some next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I've been to Chompies in the past and this location has definitely stepped up their game. The breakfast sandwiches are some of the tastiest I have had in a long time, especially the spinach, swiss and egg white breakfast sandwich. The bagels taste like they were imported from NYC and all of the cream cheese is made in house. The blueberry cream cheese is particularly good, however they also have a salted caramel cream cheese that I am excited to try next time I nearby. The one thing I wish they would improve is their coffee. It is solid diner coffee, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time in the past (few years ago) and the tong sandwich was always great.  However, came back over the Thanksgiving holiday this year to get my tong sandwich fix while back in town, and the meat was over cooked and dry.  May have just been an off night for Compies, but this meal was a 1 out of 5."}
{"text":"The bagels here are amaZing!!! I get them every time we have friends and family in town. The different cream cheeses are really good too, although I just stick with low fat plain. Don't forget a black and white cookie"}
{"text":"Chompies is definitely the best breakfast spot in the ASU area. On weekends you're going to have to 20-30 minutes for a table but it is well worth it. They have a very big menu which usually leads to me spending way too much time deciding on what to order but I'm always satisfied with what I get. Their reputation speaks for itself so if you have not been yet I suggest you go soon."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place I must say you are missing out on a great BREAKFAST JOINT! This place is always packed, which is a good sign and worth the wait sometimes. Their menu is endless, the servers are all young college students and are super easy to get along with. As a college student myself, I must say having a restaurant that not only serves food but has fresh baked bread, deli meat and pastries daily is huge plus. 

I highly suggest you order the CABO SKILLET if you are looking for something with a little kick."}
{"text":"Well all the hype and it was a dud..1st time last time..here it goes the 4 pickles they give were ok .. Jey the server was nice. but wasn't sure if they have yoo-hoo ??wife had a 5 dollar milkshake instead like a 16oz glass that was milk and ice blended with whip cream.yes ice chunks in the shake thumbs down,Vincent Vega would have slapped Buddy Holly for that.. i had 5 town on sour dough with wedges ..wedges were awesome hot crisp and tasty..best part of the meal..got side of watered down ranch ughh ..Sandwich was huge and dove right in tasty but assembled with reckless abandon and where was the avocado NONE..i looked...Jey ask if i wanted a side , uh ya its suppose to be there,he brought out quarter of a sliced avocado..now the 2 budlight drafts i had..glass was not chilled so turned my beer warm. total disappointment..Maybe should have had breakfast.. When we left we looked at deserts and Cream cheese spreads looked good maybe we should have had desert..We will never know cause we wont be back..Oh Jey. we saw yoo-hoo in the to go case for drinks."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from chompie's spent almost 90.00 and in this I ordered cherry cheese strudel it had so much mold and mildew.  Never will I eat there food again"}
{"text":"I wanted to try something different today.
I really enjoyed it. The food is excellent (my cocktail too) and the service very good , the server was really nice and helpful.
I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The menu is way too big, which is typically a bad sign for a restaurant.  After eating our meal at Chompie's Deli, we've decided to change our opinion on this stereotype.  Compie's has a 7+ page menu and serves breakfast/lunch/dinner all day long (some plate options aren't offered till after 11am), but we'd guess that everything is amazing.

All the food from our order was fresh, tasted amazing, and came in huge servings.  You don't need to order the Man vs Food challenge to leave here stuffed.  In fact, we wish that they offered half servings of some of their meals and sides.  My wife loved her Jackie's Dipper, but would have been fine with half the sandwich.  The menu says that the Awesome Crispy Onion Strings serves two, but we felt that, with a sandwich, the appetizer/side would be perfect for 4-5 people.  You know that a dining experience is almost perfect when one of the only complaints pertains to \"way too big portions.\"

Establishment is immaculate, employees are professional and extremely friendly, and the location is very convenient.  The prices are little bit expensive, but are offset by the sheer quality of the ingredients.  Besides offering some smaller portion options for some of their items, the only other suggestion we have would be to add a pickle on the side with sandwich orders.  We will definitely eat at Chompie's again before we finish our visit in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We wanted to try one of their second locations before we left Arizona.  See the review of our first stop here: https://www.yelp.com/biz/chompies-deli-phoenix-2 .  We loved both locations and would highly recommend either.  This location slightly wins because they gave us free pickles with our order.  They had two types and we enjoyed the variety.

We tried their Reuben, which I adored.  Just an amazing sandwich.  My wife ordered a Knish as a side dish and it was a meal in itself.  After our two visits, we really believe that anything on the menu would be tasty and come in a huge portion."}
{"text":"I flew into Scottsdale yesterday to spend the day with my aunt who turned 90.  Having a hankering for real deli, we chased on over to Chompies.

I had a half corned beef sandwich and matzo ball soup.  The tasty corned beef was lean and thinly sliced and piled high.  The rye bread was soggy on the bottom.  The lean corned beef is probably healthier than the marbled kind, but that is what you can get in LA and New York and it is sooo good.

The matzo ball soup had a few carrots and noodles, but the soup itself was nothing to write home to mom about.  The matzo ball was fluffy and comfortable."}
{"text":"I have been to each of the Chompies locations, this one is my favorite, but all of them have had great service and fantastic food.

I love that they have potato pancakes, which is the first thing I ever ordered from them and they didn't dissappoint!  They even give you apple sauce for them, which rarely happens places.

The smoked salmon is delicious and is my current favorite things are the ones that have it on it.  

I'm not a big fan of the complimentary pickles they bring to the table...they just aren't pickley enough for me, they kind of just taste like cucumber that have sat in vinegar for a little while."}
{"text":"Good food and service overall. They were speedy with service and getting their meals out to us. I had the sirloin skillet and it was hot when they brought it. The flavor was decent. The coffee was hot and bold. I enjoy a hot cup of decent coffee more that a cool cup of the best coffee.

Have to try more things at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Yum.yum.yum. This is one of my favorite cheat day treats. The salads are so delicious, the sandwiches so very tasty, meat made with love and a treat from the bakery makes the whole experience a happy one. Friendly, knowledgeable service and clean, New York inspired decor."}
{"text":"My wife and I made our 1 and only stop at the Chompies at Chandler Mall because I had heard that it was a great \"authentic\" deli.  I have read a lot of the other reviews on this site and I wonder if they ate at the same restaurant I did?  In my opinion an \"authentic\" deli does not sell Boars head meats in their deli.  They make their own meats, smoke their own etc.  They don't buy it from a wholeseller out of the back of the truck behind the store.  Strike one.  Ordered the Pastrami and was beaming from ear to ear when it arrived as I have been looking for a huge stacked Pastrami since I moved to Arizona in 1980.  Unfortunately the Pastrami had absolutely no taste.  So disappointed.  Strike 2.  I then asked for some spicy mustard (hoping it would help with the taste) and was told they don't have that kind of mustard.  Strike 3 we're outta here.  I will give them a point for being as close to a real deli as I have found in Phoenix, but I will definately continue to look and I will definately not be back to Chompies."}
{"text":"\"As if they have good Mexican dogs at the Jewish deli! C'mon, girl. Haha.\" ? Kat P. of Yelp Phoenix

Anybody got ice for that burn?  She told me!  RIP J-WoW.  *Z-snaps, hairflip*

We came here to take advantage of the $8.99 BOGO hot dog deal, with the purchase of two drinks, for spring training.  We got two Sonora dogs (one with fries and one with coleslaw), a chili cheese dog with fries, and the corned beef hot dog with fries.  Overall it was okay.  The Sonora dog was disappointing but still tasty.  I was expecting beans, mayo, tomatoes, et cetera.  It fell short of all that but it was still decent --- just don't call it a Sonora dog!

I was pretty amped up with getting the Baker's Box special they had going on for $10.99 which includes thirteen bagels and two 1/2lb tubs of cream cheese.  I also redeemed my Yelp check-in offer of a free black and white cookie.  That thing was huge.

I prefer the Chandler location more than this Tempe location as it was both not busy yet service was a bit slow.  At least the location is clean and the eats are decent.  This is where Adam Richman of Man vs Food did his slider challenge so it was pretty neat to pop into the same spot where Food won."}
{"text":"The first time I heard about Chompie's, I was watching Travel Channel's Man v. Food and I saw Adam Richman taking on the Ultimate Slider Challenge in the Tempe location.  While I had no urge to try and stuff myself silly, the sliders sounded tasty!

Chompie's is a casual eatery with a laid-back vibe.  It's not a date spot but definitely a great place for a quick bite and good times.  Some of my favorites are the Jewish Sliders, Greek Benedict, Mark's Monte Cristo, and the Western Sliders.  Don't forget to pick up some rye bread or bagels on the way out.  Yum!

I hear they do a Valentine's Day special now.  Oh to be young and kosher..."}
{"text":"The best bagels in the valley all start here.  And who doesn't love a bagel?  But this Chompie's isn't just about the bagels.  This is one of the best places for breakfast in the valley. Corned beef hash, potato pancakes, chicken fried steak, and of course eggs served either traditionally w/ bacon to done w/ lox and onions served w/ a bagel.  I was surprised how good their pancakes were, but I realized I shouldn't be since they are a bakery and all.  Silly rabbit.  

Hmmmm... strange concept.. Jewish deli for lunch..?  Rocks.  Super duper rocks.  Their reuben has been good to me.  And their patty melt is so freaking good.  Messy to the point you need extra napkins and maybe a spare shirt, but super good.  

They also have an amazing selection of other desserts and baked goods.  I've never been disappointed.  And for you East coast transplants, you can also pick up some of your old East coast yummies here - say a bag of Wise potato chips? Certainly made some of my peeps happy.  

A great spot for a surprisingly good meal, or just a dozen bagels for the office."}
{"text":"The only reason it is getting 3 stars is because the food is really good! But in October when ordered for pick up and they said it would be ready in 20 minutes it was not which wouldn't have been a big deal if they didn't make us wait an extra hour to get our food that we paid for. While we were waiting we thought it was taking way to long to get our food and we kept asking and they said it should be out by now.....we'll where is it?!?! After they told us to keep waiting and we were there for an hour they said they found our food and it has been sitting on the counter for 40 minutes..... are you kidding me by that time the food was cold and the pancakes were soggy they didn't even offer to make new ones instead they gave us a 20 dollar credit for when we return next. While my boyfriend and I didn't want chompies till recently we called to see if we can use the 20 dollar credit and they said no because it has been over a month. I get that they have their policies but they never said we only had a month. If they would've told us that in the beginning I would be fine but there customer service is lacking"}
{"text":"We ventured out to get some lunch and didn't want to stop at a chain restaurant we good get back home. Hubby pulled into the parking lot and I was skeptical when a patron was on the parking lot holding a dog and a couple was on the patio with a larger dog....we went on in. 

The food was delicious. I had the \"huge\" Philly style cheesesteak sandwich and even liked the coleslaw. Hubby like the split pea soup. The burger was so big he needed to take some of it to go. The girls liked their food as well. Service was good! I would visit again."}
{"text":"This is a local Favortie. The menu is amazing and the service is great. I always stare at all the treats while I wait for a table. Be prepared to wait! It's just that good. So many people come here to enjoy the food. There's everything you can dream of! Bring your while family or just come hung over to eat and feel human again."}
{"text":"Wow! I was at Mayo today and the RN recommended this place! Best breakfast ever! Hot and tasty and quick service. Can't wait to visit again! New York style food plus a fantastic bakery inside! Yumm! Way to go!"}
{"text":"I have been a patron of Chompies for 25 years. I have always had such amazing experiences here with customer service and food. Until today. We ordered Door Dash to have a relaxing Sunday while enjoying our favorite breakfast delivered from Chompies. How disappointed do you think we were when our driver arrived with just my order and not my husband's with the only excuse given to us was that the Chompies manager simply told the driver, \"we don't have blintzes any longer\". NO ONE EVEN THOUGHT TO CALL US!?! Once calling Door Dash to complain, they blamed Chompies, Adrian (the manager at Chompies) simply blamed Door Dash. Around and around the blame went. Once I asked Adrian how can she make this right before losing our business and me taking this to social media, she finally suggested she would send one of her extremely short staffed employees with whatever we wanted. No, thank you, after an hour of giving Chompies the chance to make things right, too little too late. We will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that my husband and I LOVE Chompie's in Chandler.  Came to this location quite by accident yesterday after a doctors appointment.  Greeted by the worst greeting EVER after being ignored for 2-3 minutes standing right IN FRONT OF GREETER. Once seated our server came, rushed by and we weren't quite ready.  She rushed off muttering an \"I'll be back in a few\", 8-10 minutes later, she rushed back, (thank goodness we knew what we wanted, the boot camp fitness omelet for both of us), off she went.  A good time later, another server approached with our order, realized it was the same so she didn't have to engage us and literally, I mean, literally TOSSED our plates on the table and turned so fast to get away from us we were both shocked.  Now, mind you, we're easy going, my husband is a police officer, we're not alarmists.  So far, this was a disaster dining experience. It got worse as I finished my tea and our meals and after finishing our food NEVER could wave down our server or ANYONE again.  We went up to the \"greeter\" and said we have to leave and he said you have to pay your server.  I told him we COULDN'T EVER GET HER ATTENTION to do so and he said with a huff, \"fine, where were you, is this what you had....\", Dammit I even left her a tip and I still want it back.  I really wish I didn't have to type this.  In fact I rarely do reviews.  It was just so sad that they feel that they can treat people this way. In closing, shame on you Chompie's Deli.  I'm telling everyone I know your service is the worst."}
{"text":"Myself & a colleague just ordered the worst traditional Reubens known to man from this place ... no sourkraut , no thousand island dressing , bread wasn't toasted , dry tasteless corned beef ..the pickle was bad & the potatoe salad was not good ... when I called to complain , \"Mario\" said to call Doordash to complain !!  
Will never order food from here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I had breakfast at Chompie's today.  It was not only delicious but very hearty. They cooked our meals perfectly.  Our waitress was very attentive and very caring.  We love this restaurant and will definitely return.

If you have not been to Chompie's, you are really passing  up a great experience.  Their portions are plentiful so you will have enough for leftovers.  Their bagels are fantastic and the cream cheese delicious.   Bakery items are mouth watering ... you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I was in the area doing some shopping, and both my man and I decided it was time to eat. Unfortunately it was only 10:30 AM so we needed a place that was open early. Chompie's it was. I've had both their breakfast and sandwiches and I hate to rate it so low but honestly, I just don't get it. It's all Eh...alright. It's very standard deli food, definitely nothing mind blowing. I think the fact there's an actual deli in Tempe gets people excited more than anything, because there's not a whole hell of a lot of deli/restaurants around. 

The menu IS huge so there's a lot to choose from. They have a wide array for breakfast and a lot of healthier options. Unfortunately I've always left feeling like it wasn't worth the money. I got one of their chicken sandwiches and the chicken was overcooked, dry, and the grilled vegetables on top were soggy. I've had the pastrami before, and while tasting okay, it wasn't super-juicy and melt in your mouth. I'm obviously spoiled.

I've been to some outstanding Jewish and Italian deli's in LA- namely Langer's and Philippe's in the heart of downtown. There's so many good delis in the huge metropolises, but not so much around Phoenix. Sorry Chompie's, you just don't do it for me. I like the bloody mary's and pickles though!"}
{"text":"Visited for a takeout, so only reviewing on the food and not the place.

A beastly huge sandwich, with loads of filling. But wasn't over impressed, I guess the quantity v quality thing applies for me here. I thought the bread was poor and not up to the job. Especially as it cost $13, if I remember it was the New Yorker. Picked up a better sandwich in an airport in Hartford last week for cheaper. That can't be a god sign?"}
{"text":"We heard about Chompie's on Triple D and had to try it. We had corned Beef hash with eggs and cottage cheese. The food was average, although the corned beef hash is homemade. The other dish was Chompie's Eggs Benedict. Again, it was average. I regret not gave ordered the blueberry pancake. Another customer was having it and it looked delicious. Our server, Faith, was attentive and knowledgeable. They do serve breakfast all day long, have outdoor patio with heat lamps for cold days."}
{"text":"Good food and excellent service from Josh

I had the beef brisket sandwhich.  Loved the fries with aujuis"}
{"text":"I went to Chompies this afternoon to take advantage their St. Patrick's Day Corned Beef and Cabbage dinner.  My experience started off well.  I arrived shortly before 3 pm and I was delighted to have arrived at an hour when they weren't busy at all.  

I was seated immediately in a nice booth, and water was quick to follow.  I spent just a moment reviewing the menu, and just as I made my decisions, my server showed up.  He was a friendly young man, and after answering a couple of questions for me and letting me know that they were out of the Vegetable Medley, he took my order.  I ordered the Corned Beef and Cabbage dinner which came with corned beef, cabbage - and I elected to have boiled red potatoes and mashed potatoes with gravy as my two sides.  The dinner also came with soup or salad, and I requested to have the sour cabbage soup to go, and ordered a glass of strawberry lemonade.

My soup to go, and my dinner came out pretty quickly, but as I ate a bite of the red boiled potatoes, I realized that the potatoes were nearly cold.  I checked the rest of my food, and it was all room temperature.  I had to wait a few minutes for my server  to come within view, and I hailed  him.  I explained that my potatoes were cold, and that nothing on the plate was thoroughly heated.  He told me that he would bring me a new plate that was hot as quickly as possible.

The new plate came out a few minutes later, but it was actually the same plate (I had cut a piece or two of corned beef, and sliced my cabbage wedge in half before I realized the food wasn't heated).  I didn't really mind that it wasn't a new plate, it just wasn't what I was told would happen.  No big deal.

The food was still only warm, not hot, but I was hungry and so I didn't send it back again.  Also, my gravy was now missing from the plate.  I didn't make an issue of it since I had decided on taking the masked potatoes home with me, and figured I could just bring me a container of gravy to go when I finished eating.  I knew that I would be taking quite a bit of food home with me as the portions were VERY generous. 

After awhile my server returned to see how my food was.  I said it was better, that I was planning to take my mashed potatoes with me and would need my gravy to go since they hadn't brought it out with my \"new\" plate of food.  He quickly brought me a to go box and a container of gravy.  While he was getting the gravy, I'd noticed that I never got my strawberry lemonade, so when he returned I asked him to take it off my check.  He apologized and said he would bring me one to go for free.  He returned to let me know they didn't have the strawberry mix for the lemonade.  I indicated that plain lemonade was fine.

I packed up my potatoes, gravy and other leftovers into the to go box.  He returned with the lemonade and helped me to bag my to go containers, and took away my now empty plate.  Then, nothing...  I sat there waiting for my check, and waited, and waited.  Part way into my wait I checked my watch, and waited another 10 minutes.  I could see my waiter walking around, standing and talking to other staff members, talking some more, but he never came close enough for me to flag down.  Finally, I took my things, went to the front counter, and told them that I wanted to pay, but I'd been waiting for my check for over 10 minutes.

The gentleman at the front very nicely looked up my table, provided my check, and took my payment.  The restaurant still wasn't very busy, so the issues that I had may just relate to how that location of Chompies is run.

The food, properly heated, would have rated 4 solid stars.  The cold food and service issues don't allow me to spare more than a 2 star rating.  Sorry for the length of this."}
{"text":"Im soooo glad I gave this place another try! Other than the guy behind me stirring his soup by banging his spoon in his bowl, everything was fantastic! We tried the fried chicken salad, the cobb and the jewish sliders and shared everything. The sliders had a potato pancake and a huge pile of brisket and cheese on mini challah bread. 3 of them with fries! The fried chicken salad was awesome too. Lots of chicken and   veggies. The cobb had sliced chicken and avocado etc...Lindsey was our server and she took great care of us. We grabbed a piece of cheesecake on our way out and Im looking forward to that treat later! Thank you chompies for turning this visit around for me!"}
{"text":"For some reason I thought this place was Just a bagel shop, boy I sure was delighted to be wrong. I've had their breakfast sliders twice now and they are delish! I cant forget to mention the homestyle potatoes & sausage gravy that come along side are a perfect compliment!"}
{"text":"Banana walnut pancakes ! I was in a hurry and did not have a lot of time to eat an elaborate brunch. The pancakes were sooooo good. The place is usually busy during brunch times, but the service was quick in spite of that. 

Next time here, I'm trying out their skillets !"}
{"text":"Bad bialy day.  I got a plain bialy from them today for take out.  It had the consistency of Wonder Bread.  Both my wife and I tasted it and decided we can get better, much better.  Most bialys I have had are even denser than the establishment's bagels.  Perhaps they just had a bad day, but nothing that looks like white bread for me."}
{"text":"Finally!!! A chompie's for the west side--west siders rejoice! Located near forever 21 & Macy's in former miracle mile space. Same great restaurant, deli, bakery, etc that the valley has been used to since '79. Congrats Mark & family! Well done"}
{"text":"Nice solid NY deli. Great throwback. Excellent deli, bakery & catering. Huge portions, great food & service. Can't wait for Arrowhead to open this spring!"}
{"text":"This is a tough one to review as there was a high point but several low points.

Plus: 
Gluten free offerings - Gluten free brownie was excellent! Onion roll was pretty good too, although it had a large air bubble. The manager at the front stated only gluten free offerings were onion rolls and brownies, this is at the tempe location. I had thought there would be more gluten free options as indicated on the Chompie's website.

Cons:
Halfway stale bagels. Pretty sure I wasn't given fresh bagels, they were somewhat hard, not soft at all. If they were fresh, they didn't taste it. The grocery store bagels were *better*. This is very bad!

Garlic cream cheese. It has raw garlic and lots of it. This is just a minor problem though, I would just stick to plain cream in the future if I went back.


Because of the old bagels, I wont be returning to this location, but I'll give the Chandler mall location a try."}

* Update*
Have been going in steady for the past few weeks to get my morning bagel. The usual gal's that help me are always friendly and prompt. Today, one of the regulars got my bagel ready, but a different person rang me up. Charged me more than what I've been getting charged. When I questioned, the person got offended and would hear nothing of it, just kept quoting me the new price. If I'd been getting some special price for the past few weeks, how was I to know, I was just paying what I'd asked, now I get a 33% increase and am not supposed to question it? 

I'm just asking for some courtesy and consistency. 

*************

The food is good as are the portion sizes but the prices are high. service leaves a little to be desired. 

Stopped in today for a bagel and coffee. Ordered an untoasted bagel with light veggie cream cheese, received a toasted with plain. Was not busy, the counter person just flat out ignored my request.  Don't even think of calling the dark water they serve, coffee. Weakest cup of Joe I've had in the Valley."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but not worth the hefty price tag. Baked goods look lovely but are bland and blah. Service is crazy disorganized and slow. The guy behind the counter stood around talking and laughing with his coworkers for a couple of minutes while I waited for him to start making my sandwich."}
{"text":"The bagels were good as always. This location needs a makeover badly. The front counter at the PV and Scottsdale location are much more attractive and has a larger selection of baked goods."}
{"text":"For an exNew Yorker, this is fabulous, my fav is Lovey's breakfast consisting of smoked salmon on top of sour cream & latkes topped w a mixture of cucumbers, onions, tomatoes & capers.  The cheese blitzes are also perfect.  The service is inconsistent - that's frustrating but wouldn't stop me from many return visits."}
{"text":"First time at Chompie's was today for breakfast and we were not disappointed. Great choices and  great food. The northern omelet was filled with corned beef hash and covered with melted cheddar and the granola pancakes were huge and delicious."}
{"text":"Great service, even for a busy Saturday.  Our server was a grandmother too, which was really cool.  Food was above average but nothing great.  Bread/toast was good, pancakes I can't understand why they're popular, and actually the Southwest breakfasts were rather good - breakfast enchiladas, for example.  Popular spot, and I can see why."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would.  I truly want to love and recommend Chompie's but I can't, even after multiple attempts to provide them with an opportunity for redemption.  This posts is not from one offensive visit but the culmination of living within a 10 minute drive of the restaurant and dining in the restaurant or ordering for pick up at least 6-10 times.   
As previous posts note, service is subpar at best.  Too many times have we gone to eat in the restaurant and have received inattentive servers.  If you need something after your food is literally dropped off, you have to waive your server down as they do not come back to check on you.  
There was an occasion our food was brought to our table, by a different server, and our original server never came back to check on us.  The next time he came to our table was to bring the bill while we were still eating.  He didn't say anything except dropping the bill on the table.  A not so subtle way to hurry us through our dinner.  I thought this was strange because the restaurant was not busy.  It seemed like there were no servers working, as they must have been in the BOH hiding.  
I have provided example of times we dined in so I thought if we picked up food to go, it would alleviate the poor customer service aspect, as we do like the food.  This notion is inaccurate.  We ordered two sandwiches via phone.  When we brought our order back to our office, we noticed our two sandwiches were not remotely close to what we ordered.  When I called to inform Chompie's, I received a combative employee on the other end of the line.  She told me they were busy and it would take at least 45 minutes to correct their mistake.  When I noted, this was an error on their side, she said she could not re-do the order in a more expeditious manner.  That made me feel like they were too busy and we were not important.
The last straw for me was from this morning.  I order two bagels to go.  I came into the restaurant and got in line to order.  I saw they were busy because of the upcoming holiday and understood it would take a little longer than usual to receive my food.  Ok.  However, for $10, 20 minutes, and yet, again and inaccurate order, I cannot condone coming here any longer.  
When I got home and called, I spoke with two different employees.  The first was understanding and placed me on a hold while she reached out to a manager.  The second employee I spoke to, picked up the phone as if she had no idea why I was calling.  I had to re-explain the story to her, explain why I was frustrated, and received no understanding or apology.  
My options were to come back to Chompie's to pick up my correct order or to provide a credit the next time I'm in the restaurant.  How about reimbursing me?  There will be no next time because there have been too many instances of previous times that were not handled correctly.   The food is good but for lack of service and price, there are other East Coast bagel & Jewish delis in the Valley who will go beyond with their food and service.  (Lox Stock & Bagel on the corner of Hayden & E McCormick Pkwy is delicious!)"}
{"text":"Visited in July & September, from CA...Great Matzo Ball Soup and other favs, but both visits had a lack of service-- I can't give this place more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"I am from New York was looking for a good ny style deli found Chompie's figured I'll give it a try they have great matzah ball soup seen man vs food slider challange had to try it they have awesome Jewish sliders with lots of gravy yummmy will be back again"}
{"text":"Chompies always takes care of my members, i am happy to go. Food is always great and servings are large."}
{"text":"Every time someone mentioned Chompies, it was always praise and then disbelief that I hadn't been there yet. So I finally went (Arrowhead & PV locations). Within one month of my first visit, I went back 6 times. Believe the hype, folks! I know NY. I also had the pleasure of teaching at a Hebrew academy for several years where I made many friends of the Jewish faith. Learned a lot about their foods during that time. And ate...A LOT. Because of these reasons, I judge delis. There, I said it... I am a deli-judger! And as commercial as Chompies might seem, (at least to me because the ones I've been to are located in malls- Paradise Valley and Arrowhead ) they'll give you one helluva meal. Plain and simple- great food!! Flavorful, hearty and satisfying. I've tried the following: Nova Lox, Gramma's potato pancakes, cabbage rolls, Mile High pastrami, Mile High whitefish, Mile High egg salad, matzo balls, split pea soup, pierogis and I can't recall what else. Each dish was splendid. In a dream world, I'll try their entire menu. Til then...you should give 'em a try."}
{"text":"Love the fact they have gf items however even gluten intolerant people would like their food to be made presentable and delivered intact."}
{"text":"First off, the Jewish sliders are a treasure! Nice little challah bun with brisket, potato latke and Swiss melted together. Rich brown gravy to bring it together.
Fries are usually very good, but... Quality varies.
My problems with this place are the low standards of cleanliness, inconsistent food and service.
When it's good, it's really good though."}
{"text":"We love Chompies!!  My daughter loves the pickles, my husband loves the deli sandwiches and I love the matzah ball soup!  We have been going to the Scottsdale location for years the only reason for the 4 star review is the service has been steadily declining :(.  Still great food though!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place years ago. But last two times we went for breakfast and the food was awful, service slow and just nothing to like about it. The skillet breakfast (I got the Cabo) was so bland and greasy and gross. Even the egg wasn't cooked right and was super crispy and greasy on sides. Super disappointed. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast the Sunday after Thanksgiving - our first time here and son's multiple time. Huge portions! Great service! What a surprise to find this in the heart of the US West. Latkes were my favorite and the Eggs Benedict/Dave-style were wonderful. Fully crowded, quick service, all three breakfast dishes were perfect. A must-do when we visit again."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Service is okay. Décor is okay. Tables/booths are okay. What else can I say, but Chompie's is just okay."}
{"text":"Brisket was dry and flavors were not so great"}
{"text":"Delicious sliders and perfectly fried onion straws! The sliders are piled high with delicious meat and the patio seating outside is very nice. I will definitely be back to check out their bakery that seems to attract a lot of locals."}
{"text":"Normally put up with lack of service for a good meal but today neither one was on point. I got the sliders and all of my meat was like chomping down on rubber! Ha now the name makes sense. Lady had a bagel that was stale but at least out five year old enjoyed his pancakes. Server was confused the entire time and neither her or the hostess felt the need to help clear tables. They just sat people around us at dirty tables and said they would find a busser. Can't say I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"So I'm from Dallas and the gal at my hotel recommended Chompies, honestly I just wanted to go because the name made me giggle. This place is no joke! Absolutely amazing food, super friendly staff, and oh my my my the desserts!!! Highly recommend this to anyone staying in the area!"}
{"text":"We are back! They have the best food! Generous portions and reasonable price for their delicious food!"}
{"text":"I have no idea in the world how this place manages to stay open.  Without a doubt it has to be the worst managed restaurant I've been to in quite some time.

For the second weekend in a row I've tried to eat here and for the second weekend in the row I've walked out the door.

So what happened?

I walk in around noon and the waiting area is packed (as it was last week).  And as last week there were plenty of tables in the main dining area and as last week the dining area on the north side of the restaurant was completely empty (although in fairness I'm not sure I've ever seen it used).

So I asked the hostess what's up (BTW...why do restaurants insist on having very young people at this critical position?).  Her answer was that they have all of the open tables so they can give the wait staff time to service the tables they have.  

What the f@ckity f@ck f@ck???!!!???  Are you kidding me???  Did it ever occur to you to actually schedule the number of staff to handle the number of customers??  

One day after this places goes out of business, they should take the time out to see when and where  it all went off the rails.  Part of the reason will be because they can't manage to schedule enough staff to service their customers."}
{"text":"I don't eat here that often, but when i do, I am never disappointed.  Service is generally pretty good and the food portions are quite large.  My favorite there of course is the matzo ball soup.  It basically is a delicious tasting chicken noodle soup with a giant matzo ball (my favorite part). It also comes with a side of bagel chips to soak into your soup.  This most recent visit, I decided to order the Jewish slider combo meal which came with 2 Jewish sliders, matzo ball soup and cole slaw.  Though the cole slaw was sooooo good, the portion was a \"sample size\" which came in this tiny plastic sample size bowl - basically like those bowls you get at restaurants to put your ketchup in.  I was disappointed in the portion of that.  But the sliders were so good.  It was juicy, the bun was soft, the potato cakes were delish.  We also trek over to the bakery since my son gets a cupcake for good behavior - I do check in with foursquare because when you do, if you buy a bakery item you get a free specialty bagel.  Lets jump on board with that, Yelp!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints nor does it ever leave me hungry after I leave!  Portions are huge, service is friendly and they have a great rewards program which earns you Chompie's bucks to use towards your next meal.  Whenever I'm there I want to try everything but I can't say no to the Arizona Benedict (eggs benedict but with turkey, avocado and tomatoes).  Their potato cakes (latkes) are also delicious.  They also have a great dinner menu and I usually get their sliders although we don't really go there for dinner very often.  

Don't forget to check in on Yelp and receive a free bagel of your choice when you purchase an item at the take out deli!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of their food and portions but properly staffing and service needs improvement.  We had pastrami with a side of soup.  The soup was large and we expected a cup.  Thank goodness it came with a spoon because we had to hunt down someone for silverware and napkins.  Then we wanted horseradish but couldn't get anyone's attention so we settled for mustard.  Getting the bill was slow and we finally left payment and tip at the counter.  I hope the gentleman got it because we did pay but couldn't wait any longer.  I'm not sure we'll return to Chompie's unless it's not at all crowded."}
{"text":"I gave up on Chompies over ten years ago and now I know why. Came by today while waiting for X-rays nearby. Good news, they have Knishes. YUMMY! Kinishes are Delish and hard to find in Arizona. Bad news, it was frozen in the center. Sigh!

The place is super cute with the NY murals and all, the menu has a large selection. However, I just do not think the food is very good and horribly overpriced.  Service was terrible as usual. Who brings a bill without once checking on your customer or asking if they need or want anything else? I had to ask two other servers for drink refills. Meh!"}
{"text":"If you are homesick for food from NY/NJ, this place has the cure!

Pirogi - spot on, I've eaten those back home.

Chicken Schnitzel - pounded out breast fantastically crusted with traditional gravy that is loaded with flavor!

Hotdog - Heb Nation for the win

I had it delivered so can't comment on service...but the food was dialed in delicious.

Great job Chompies, you have a new customer...many other items on the menu I want to try :)"}
{"text":"STUFT TURKEY SLIDERS AND MONTE CRISTO... yummmmo! Eat here! Delicious! We have been eating here for over 10 years and i highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Talk about a great neighborhood bakery/restaurant.  Half this review is based off of my Dad who is a regular there now.  He is treated great there and they have a nice family and old school get to know your proprietor atmosphere.  I can say their service is great, they give you great deals, their baked goods are some of the best in all of Arizona, and the sandwiches I've had there are awesome as well.  I don't have anything bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"I've been to this location about a gazillion times for lunch.  It's one of the closest-to-authentic NY Style Jewish delis in Arizona.  Plus... their 1/2 sandwich and soup special is a great deal!

FOOD: Get their matzo ball soup.  It is delicious.  I also love any of their sliders, their turkey sandwiches, their corned beef... It's all good.  I get all my sandwiches on either seedless rye or on challah.  Yum.

Also... they serve both kosher and half-sour pickles.  I am not a pickle fan, but their half-sours are ADDICTIVE.  I could make a whole meal out of them if my blood pressure would forgive me.  Salty goodness - yum!

They also have daily specials like Fish Fry Fridays (I believe it is after 4).  Check their website for details.

SERVICE: David is THE BEST server at Chompie's.  He remembers me and DD every time we stop in.  Even if we are not seated in his section, he stops by to say hello.  This kind of service is what brings us back to Chompie's again and again.  He also gives DD the best cookies with her meal.

VALUE: It's excellent.  Kids eat free (1 per adult entree purchased) on Mondays and Tuesdays.  They get a generous sized meal and can choose from about 15 or so meals.  You do have to pay for a drink, but it is well-worth it. 

You know what?  I think I might pull my daughter out of preschool early today and take her for lunch.  I'm hungry!  ;)"}
{"text":"Always great food along with terrific service.
Inside Paradise Valley Mall between Dillard's and Sears with plenty of parking.

We generally will order the Jewish Sliders  or the Pastrami Sandwich on an Onion Roll.

The Pastrami Sandwich is top notch along with the Onion Roll and then throw on a splash of deli mustard and it will rival any New York Deli.

We also have had the Baja Burger with a Fried Egg and the Borstein Burger with mushrooms and Swiss which come on a Brioche Bun which is awesome.

If you are hungry go for the Mile High Sandwich which you could share if you choose or feed a basketball team.

We have ordered the Ultimate Slider Challenge to share between the 4 of us and could not finish.

We have almost made it a tradition to eat here on Christmas Day for breakfast after we open presents. It is so busy but we try to get reservations to ensure we get in.

Love the fod here and will keep coming back.

By the way, check Costco to see if they are selling their gift card $79 gets you $100 worth of food"}
{"text":"Expect to spend some time looking over the extensive menu which ranges from all-day breakfasts to a long list of sandwiches and omelets.  There are also numerous dinner items.  Once you decide you'll be treated to good food and generous portions.  My favorites are the pastrami omelet, the Leo their lox, and onions omelet, and their soup and sandwich combos.  Their deli sandwiches are piled high with meat.  Their cabbage soup is another one of my favorites.  This place is the nearest thing to a New York Deli and they do a good job of it."}
{"text":"OMG huge sandwiches.  I could not even fit the monte cristo in my mouth without heavy squishing beforehand.  It wasnt the best but it was the biggest I had eaten.  Big menu but things tend to be a little greasy and the  bakery stuff was a bit stale when we got it home.  Still pretty good!"}
{"text":"Really huge menu...  breakfast, lunch and more.  The bagels are pretty good.  Way better than anyplace else I have been in Phoenix."}
{"text":"It's good. I love the pastrami on rye. Just a really rich pastrami, great flavor. Fresh bread.

Recently, though, they cut down their portions. The sandwich used to be huge, so huge that I only got a half sandwich (and I can put away half a pizza and a dozen wings).  Now, it's small, And they serve the fries in this little, white fruit cup. Weird, and small. This the only reason I didn't do a 4th star.

The bakery is good, too. They have tons of good stuff there."}
{"text":"Location: it is located across the street from the Chandler Mall with plenty of parking. The restaurant is a bit warm. 

Service: staffs are friendly and approachable. This is my first time here and they walked me through the menu as well as dessert. 

Food: I was only here for desserts since we already had dinner before coming here. We ordered a mango flavor drink and it was decent. The huge chuck of ice makes it hard for me to drink through the small straw. We also ordered a cheese cake as well as Brooklyn 7 layer of chocolate cake. If you like the taste of sugar (I mean, nothing but sugar), you might like these dessert. Not only I do not taste the chocolate, I can't really taste the flavor of cakes neither. 

Rating: I will probably come back to try their sandwiches. But definitely will not order their dessert again."}
{"text":"Service very good, front desk excellent but the Greek salad was awful, it was very old
and saggy lettuce with nothing on top other than lots of onion and little piece of \"Greek cheese\", then I ordered  chicken on top, they put sliced chicken deli style out of refrigerator, it was terrible, the price very expensive. First and last time I ever go there."}
{"text":"We stopped in here randomly for lunch the other day and having only been to the other Chompie's in Tempe, I was pleasantly surprised that this one seemed nicer on the inside. 

The hostess was really friendly and started out our interaction by saying 'how can I help you beautiful?'...That's worth four stars alone! :) We were seated promptly in a booth (my favorite) and our waiter came over really quick and took our drink order. He was really friendly and provided great service throughout our whole meal.

Since I've been watching carbs, I opted for one of their Colossal Reuben sandwiches, Frank's Fowl Ball, without the bun and skipped the extra coleslaw and fries and substituted a dinner salad with ranch. To my surprise, this has probably been one of the greatest lower carb dining out meals I've ever head. 

The house salad was GREAT. The best kind of thick ranch, similar to the recipe at Texas Roadhouse. It had great toppings and was a big portion. As for the bunless sandwich, the coleslaw was sweet but not overly sweet (I'm sure more sugar than I would have liked but it was TOTALLY worth it). It also had a huge pile of hot, sliced turkey breast covered in thousand island dressing and melted swiss cheese. UM. YUM. Just thinking about it again today makes me want to go back today for lunch. It was THAT good. It was a huge portion and it actually allowed me to stay full for 8 hours! I never even got hungry for dinner that night so it's like two meals for the price of one!

We did cruise the display case leaving and I tried one of their chocolate sugar free cookies. It was delicious! I have no idea how many carbs were in it but it was great. Had really good flavor and was very moist. A definite treat! If you're not on a diet, my fiance swears by their canoli's. They aren't even on my top 20 list of things I'd eat for dessert but they're his favorite so try them out if they're yours! 

Overall, this is a great place with great, fast, and friendly service and a drool worthy dessert display case that I look forward to trying out one day."}
{"text":"Table for One?  Yes, please.  It was a quiet Wednesday afternoon, about 103 degrees outside (a coldfront came in)  and I was craving a bowl of matzo ball soup.  Where should I go?  Chompie's, of course!

Place was jammed with folks of all ages. Business meetings, families, seniors, firefighters and me :)

The waitress was excellent.  She grabbed my soup, complementary pickle plate and diet coke in a jif and let me indulge in peace and quiet while I enjoyed my lunch and my book.  I was in heaven.  The dumpling was the perfect size, and soaked up the proper amount of broth....there were plenty of vegetables and lots of noodles.  A bowl of love from somebody else's grandmother.  Two sizes are available.  One for the hungry, and one for the really really hungry (or the \"I want leftovers\" folks).  Take out available too.

If you don't feel like soup, the potato pancakes are the bomb....

Enjoy."}
{"text":"LA Jolla Salad is huge! Their salad dressings are great. The sliders looked great as well. They are generous with portions and the service was excellent. Extensive menu that can feed even the pickiest eaters."}
