{"text":"The Chicken Tikka Masala bowl is fantastic. Not only is it delicious but it's easy on the wallet. Rice is nicely seasoned with a hint of lemon. The chicken is well balanced with subtle flavors of heat and sweet. It was tender and cooked perfectly. This place absolutely can't be beaten for the price. As a bonus, they arrived within 45 minutes, even though they're three miles away from me. Better than many of places that cost twice as much."}
{"text":"I ordered food from these guys at 7:15pm via GrubHub on Monday night. Was a little suspicious when my food had not shown up an hour and a half later.   At 9pm, GrubHub called me and said this restaurant was just NOT ANSWERING THEIR PHONE.   They were just blatantly not answering any of the contacts GrubHub had for them. Oh. That's what I do at my business, too. I hate business so much I don't answer when business calls. I tried to call them myself - no answer. They were listed as open online. But apparently not open for people that want to give them money.   Anyways - GrubHub refunded me, but as someone who was traveling for work, starving, and waited over 2 hours to get something for dinner because of these guys - NOT impressed."}
{"text":"I order delivery a lot - probably much more than I ought to!  There has never been an Indian restaurant within delivery distance, unfortunately, as it's my absolutely favorite cuisine.  Finally this place opened up and I received my first delivery today. The samosa were pretty bad.  Not what I expected as a former native New Yorker (great samosas in NY!) and someone who spent a summer in India.  They were dry, tiny, too crusty and lacked filling.  Very disappointing.  The Aloo Gobi Bowl was OK - a little dry.  Rice very good.  The dish that turned the tables and earned this place the 4 stars for me was the Chicken Tikka Masala Bowl - it was the bomb.  Yay to having a decent Indian eating establishment on this side of town :)"}
{"text":"Was just in this evening and ordered the trio of sliders, Dal Makhani and some garlic naan.  Verdict: Delicious, the food was fresh and very flavorful!  I ordered through eat 24/7 and they were only a few minutes past the estimated delivery and the service was friendly. We definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I love Indian takeout, and there aren't many places to get it in this area- until now! This business has a mix of traditional dishes (bowls and apps) and some fusion items (sliders?!), they do takeout and catering- the latter seems to be their focus. Interior is clean, I like the chalkboard menu.  CHICKEN MASALA BOWL with rice ($9) is a flavorful, dinner-sized portion, with low heat. Added on VEGETABLE SAMOSAS (3/$5), appreciated that they weren't greasy but the filling was a little bland. GARLIC NAAN ($2.50) is tasty. Giant feast, under $20- adding another app would have made it enough for two to share.  This business currently has a $20 for $30 Yelp deal available, and a check-in special for Yelp Elites to get a free menu item up to $7- pretty neat!  Everything was pretty good until I found a large piece of plastic in my food.  EDIT: Management response has to be a joke. I know the difference between plastic and a bay leaf. I regularly cook with them too, and I know to remove them from food before serving."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the friendly service. The food was excellent for the price. Had the aloof Gobi and their fries which were seasoned with this spice that gave them a spicy kick! Will definitely return!  Would like to see more vegan options though!! Like the naan bread and samosas."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 bowls - chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi and Dal Makhani Bowl.  They were all very good but the masala is excellent and my favorite among the three. Tender and very flavorful chicken pieces.  I consumed the sauce with gusto with the extra garlic nan bread I ordered.   I recommend the samosas as well - very crunchy on the outside with just the right amount of filling & spices. Place is good for take out or catering. I wanted to try the ice cream but I was afraid it might melt by the time I get home. Will definitely come back and try their other dishes :)"}
{"text":"Ordered from here on a whim close to closing time. Chicken Tikka masala, nachos, sliders, nan... Bunch of other stuff. We spent like $60 lol. But everything was delicious and flavorful. Will definitely order from here again. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Ordered from here twice through Eat24hrs.  All three curry bowls are excellent--hard to pick a favorite.  They are flavorful and a good portion size for the price.  I thought the apps were mediocre.  The samosas were soft skinned and the filling lacked flavor.  The chaat was alright but the onions were way too overpowering.  There were also delivery issues the first time I ordered, but the delivery guy was really nice about it and sorted everything out fine."}
