{"text":"This place is a sure bet. Two of our four were vegetarians and there were many options on the menu for them to choose from. Chef Dan went out of his way to accommodate our pal who was on a restrictive diet which was super awesome. We appreciated the time he took to chat with us between dishes. 

Our service was friendly and efficient. We will definitely visit Glas again and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Went last night and  Loved everything about this small intimate restaurant. Innovative and eclectic menu. Wonderful and attentive service . Superb selection of wines .
And the food is soooooooo good!!!!!! This is a gem."}
{"text":"Intimate surroundings and imaginative Italian inspired food. The Crostini selection is a must - Ricotta and Honey was my favourite. 
The owner, Dan, is friendly and a great host. The wine selection is local, but Dan has found some great wines you won't find at your neighbourhood LCBO.
I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Truly one of the loveliest evenings in a long while. Simply glorious food. Wow!"}
{"text":"Glas is my favourite place to dine in Leslieville. I love going here for brunch with my family or dinner with my boyfriend. It's warm and cozy. The food is always awesome and the staff are friendly and attentive. 

The owner Danny is incredibly welcoming, and his genuine passion for making sure each guest experience is amazing really shines through. 

I'm not a foodie so I can't comment specifically on the dishes - I just love great food, good wine and a warm, unpretentious dining experience. That's why Glas is always my #1 pick when I go out :)"}
{"text":"We were excited to try Glas in light of the excellent reviews and the restaurant's sponsorship of Veggielicious.  However, our experience was very disappointing for several reasons: (1) the service was very slow; (2) the restaurant was very cold (and this after we and other diners asked for the heat to be turned up); (3) the food, though good, was not remarkable; (4) the portions were shockingly small (the dessert with our tasting menu was literally a 3 inch slice of pear).  In light of the price (we spent $125 with one wine pairing), the meal was poor value.  We're sad to say that we won't be back."}
{"text":"We stopped into Glas for brunch and had a delicious meal. The place is very small but it's quaint. We sat at the window and it was perfect."}
{"text":"We went their to celebrate our anniversary and we were treated with all delightful attention.  The food is absolutely delicious and wine pairing is a must have there.  The owner traveled and lived abroad, he is reflecting that on his dishes. This is an amazing spot for intimate dinning"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal at Glas last night. My friend and I celebrated her birthday (a month late, but better late than never!), and thoroughly enjoyed it.
We chose to have the tasting menu, allowing us to try five of the different menu options. We told the server what we wouldn't enjoy, but allowed her to give us what the chef chose. All five courses were delicious, from the salami and pickled peppers, the green bean salad (amazing!), sea bream with corn and zucchini, and the pea risotto. We ended with a lilac sorbet and the tastiest berries I have ever eaten.
We both had delicious cocktails...... the names of which I forget, they were that good!
The service was perfect, the chef's check in with us at the table was a great touch, and I would strongly recommend going here.
Four hours after arriving we walked out, having had a really wonderful evening."}
{"text":"My partner and I came for the vegetarian tasting menu on New Year's Eve. It was delicious, particularly the butternut squash soup with smoked sour cream and the pan-seared potato gnocchi. My partner really enjoyed her gluten-free option (polenta and red cabbage), but didn't love the lentil dish that followed.

The ambience was nice for a date, and the service was attentive and friendly. We would go again!"}
{"text":"What a great little place! There are only approximately 10 tables which really gives it an intimate feel. Service was excellent. The bartender and chef both came over at different times throughout our meal to make sure we were enjoying the drinks and food. Which we were! Everything was great. My boyfriend and I both tried the vegetarian tasting menu and although I was a bit skeptical, given that vegetarian dishes are never my first choice when I eat out, everything was delicious and you could tell quality ingredients had been used. Cocktails were also excellent - great mixologist. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Recommandé par un bon ami à mois qui a habité Toronto ces dernières années... Il m'a dit tout petit mais extra! Ça décrit très bien ce petit bistro trop bien cache de Queen West! Trop peu connu par les locaux selon moi car quelques tables libres en plein vendredi soir!! Nous avons pris le menu dégustation avec le vin local... Tout était bon, bien servi et bien présenté. Je recommande sans hésitation."}
{"text":"The good:
- takes reservations via OpenTable, even for brunch.  Granted, I made reservations but the place was empty the entire time we were there, but still a welcome feature
- service was polite, friendly and efficient. Keep in mind they had one person cooking, so the food took a while to come out
- food was good, coffee was good

The weird:
- my grilled cheese had meat in it, despite it having a green \"V\" next to the description and no indication it'd have meat in it?  Perhaps they green \"V\" means it could become vegetarian (as this symbol was also next to a food item with salmon listed in it), but they should still list meat if it'll be present
- prices were ASTRONOMICAL.  Bill came to $50 and we didn't really eat anything and had no alcohol.  Also: no Caesars :( just Mimosas  (for $8.50!!!!)  Each serving for mains were tiny, and so you basically had to order a side, which made mains run $20


If they got more reasonably priced brunch items, I would trek out here again.  But, since I'm not in the neighbourhood, I probably wouldn't be back.

ALSO ONLY CASH AND DEBIT!"}
{"text":"Always nice to visit our friends at Glas. And the food was crazy good, yet again!  If you want an easy going place with a hit of elegance, this is the place. We love it here because we can also bring our own wine to add to the magnificent food. Yum!"}
{"text":"So right off the bat, I'm going to get something off my chest.  Leslieville is totally not on my list of neighborhoods for great food (with a few exceptions such as Goods & Provisions and Bobbette & Belle).   With that said I had always heard rave reviews from others about Glas Wine Bar and was excited when a friend decided to take me there for my birthday.

Glas Wine Bar doesn't wow you with its minimalist decor.  It's a quaint restaurant that seats around 25 with an open kitchen and bar.  I love that their wine list is Ontario-heavy which goes hand-in-hand with their mantra of local and seasonal ingredients.  It's also worth mentioning that they make a wicked Dirty Martini here.

I will forewarn that there were a few hiccups throughout the evening since chef/owner Dan Pantano was rolling out a new menu and training new kitchen staff.  There were even changes to the new menu as we sat down and our server explained some substitutions.  They ran out of the white wine I wanted and I had to send my glass of white wine back because it wasn't chilled properly.  I'm sure if I was there on any other day, these minor wrinkles may not exist...

Instead of a bread basket, we get a bowlful of assorted, candied nuts to start which I definitely didn't complain about.  My dining companion was worried I'd get full just chowing down on nuts.

We started out with a duo of crostini and fungus was the name of the game as we opted for mixed mushroom ragu and local ricotta, black truffle & honey ($3 each).  Both were good and the flavor profiles really melded together, especially the ricotta, black truffle and honey.

Continuing on with my love of things that come on boards, we opted for the Glas Tagliere ($18), which included a trio of local cheese, daily terrine, pickled veg and toasted bread.  The trio of cheeses were all from Quebec and included: Le Douanier (the Canadian doppelganger for French Morbier, a semi-soft cheese with a grey-blue ash made from maple wood), Bleu Bénédictin (another semi-soft cheese, made by monks) and Grey Owl (a surface-ripened goat's milk cheese).  The Douanier was definitely my favorite cheese, but it was the honey that was my favorite overall.

I am told that if you walk down the street to one of the neighborhood garages, you'll see a man who seldom smiles, but if you ask him how you can get a hold of his honey he's all smiles.  He gathers his honey from Quebec.  Gosh, maybe I should just book a trip to Quebec already!  I loved everything about this board.  The daily terrine was a ham hock terrine and it was also very delicious with a nice, crispy, golden crust.

The Beef Tartar ($14) was quite yummy and came on a bed of smoked potato salad and quail egg.  Can't say I've quite had a tartar like this before; usually the egg is raw and mixed in but I actually found the boiled egg made for a lighter, less rich tartar which was not a bad thing.  The potato salad was really different as it still had crunch and bite to it and wasn't over-boiled.

We kind of regretted ordering the 6 oz. Bavette Steak ($22) because a) we were pretty full and b) it wasn't all that amazing.  The spiced avocado mousse was a strange choice of accompaniment for a steak and the potato and onion \"pancake\" was really just a round smear of mashed potato.  With that said, the flank steak had great texture and was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  I found their menu lacking when it came to choices with only 4 mains and 2 of the items because starch/grain (rigatoni and risotto); that's a lot of real estate to take up for mains.

Knowing that it was a birthday, the folks did bring out a dessert on the house; a Strawberry Rhubarb Tart with red wine syrup.  Though to be fair, it was more akin to a muffin than a tart.  It was very buttery and I loved the edible flowers that wreathed around the dessert.  Despite being full, I finished every crumb.

I would say I had a satisfactory dining experience at Glas.  The service was friendly and stellar and the food was good for the most part.  I would come back for drinks, tapas/shareables and dessert but probably skip the mains.  Plus, I'm the type that likes to graze and have a nibble of everything."}
{"text":"An unexpected surprise from such a small place. Authentic Italian (not pasta, real Italian) in every way from the cocktails to the music."}
{"text":"A tiny hole-in-the-wall restaurant on Queen East. One of those blink-and-you'll-miss-it spots that can still be called a neighbourhood gem.

I first heard about their veg-friendly menu via their own Twitter efforts, but the Veggielicious vegan four course prix fixe is what got us through the door.

The place was packed when we entered and very noisy. Because it's such an intimate space, one loud (possibly drunk) party elevated the noise level by several degrees. I doubt it's always like this and the moment this group left the ambiance changed completely. We were dining kind of late and this is a wine bar, so I'm not deducting anything because of this particularly obnoxious group.

Service was excellent, though we did struggle to hear and order wine over the loud talkers. They only offer a selection of well-curated Ontario wines. I went for a sparkling Hinterland white cap and was very pleased with it. My dining partner went for the wine pairing with each dish.

The first two courses were superb: a parsnip and apple soup, followed by a warm beet and potato salad served on a charcuterie board and topped with some sprouts. 

Where this meal lost me was at the main, which was pitched as a celery root pappardelle, but was literally just sliced celery root and no sign of pappardelle. This was disappointing, as we had read the cuisine here was Italian and we're not gluten phobic or raw foodists, so we were hoping for celery root-infused pappardelle or the like. The dish was too light as a result of just being shaved vegetable and I wasn't crazy about how the flavour of the celery root worked with the pesto. I get that making fresh pasta without eggs can be difficult, but it's not impossible. Please try!

For dessert, it was white wine poached pears, which walked the line between sweet and savoury in a cocoa balsamic reduction and basil garnish. It was simple and not particularly exciting.

Overall, this was an excellent meal, with the hits far outweighing the misses. I only offer this criticism so they can improve their vegan offerings, but vegan food does not need to be 100% whole vegetables and fruits. Think about incorporating grains, wild rice, even legumes into your meals to balance them out. There's a lot of wonderful local ingredients to work with.

Looking forward to seeing what vegan offerings they cook up in 2014 and I'd return just for the wine."}
{"text":"Frankly, it's all about fresh, local small plates served with a glass of wine.  Glas has taken over Frankly Eatery's old spot and has been serving up different small plates with a decent wine list. 

The restaurant is intimate.  It has seating for about twenty people and an open kitchen where the food is made.  The space has been lightened up with a fresh coat of paint from Frankley's decor, but otherwise is by-in-large intact.  I will say that the A/C unit struggles to cool the space, so it does get hot in here!

The food is Italian inspired and focused on the ingredients.  When my wife and I came here for dinner a couple weeks back, we had the gravlax, trout and frittata, along with a couple glasses on Ontario wine.  The food was wonderfully executed both in terms of presentation, cooking technique and taste.  You can believe that Danny Pantano, the chef, has tons of experience, including at several MIchelin-rated restos per his bio.  Service was warm and personable.  Danny also makes a point to chat with patrons, which is always nice.  My only beef is that the portions are quite small (even though it's small plates), especially given the price.  Personally, I'd increase the portion size and keep the prices where they are. 

It's clearly a restaurant built with personal passion and it shows!  I wish them lots of success and raise a 'glas' to them."}
{"text":"Good quiet atmosphere and most of them seem to be on dates. Me and my friend had a nice dinner and talked through most couples who had a quick dinner there. 

Service was good. The tables were very cramped together so I do apologies to our neighbours who might have been forced to listen to girl-talk on their date night. 

We had the Glas Tagliere, Beetroot salad, kale salad and wine. The cheese selection on the Tagliere was delicious. The cures meat was not that too memorable. The kale salad as enjoyable. We wanted dessert but the wine cake and bread pudding wasn't appealing to is that evening.

I was hoping for a more appeal main selection too :(

Good ambience throughout."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the heart of a neighborhood that prides itself on hidden gems.

We had heard the buzz about this place.   Something about blah blah blah local and blah blah blah wine bar.   It blended in with so much of what we'd heard of so many other places in town.   It wasn't catching our attention.

Then, while we were walking by on Queen Street.. we were gestured to come inside by a patron in the window.    We listened.

Sure,  we knew it was a wine bar.     Sure,  we knew it was going to have a well-curated list.   But what we didn't know was that the food quality was going to be so creatively stellar.  

Outstandingly flavored dishes.   Perfectly prepared.  Perfectly sized.     

Top notch, well-timed service.  

An absolutely wonderful place that captures the unique high-end, but approachable character of this great part of town. 

One of the best spots in Leslieville."}
{"text":"Amazing food in Leslievile ! Service was very attentive and pleasant...and Dan the chef is creative and sends out one dish that is better than the next ! Enjoy the regular or veg tasting menu, the crostini, and the charcuterie plates."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of visiting Glas a couple of weeks ago. Love the neon sign!
This is not really a restaurant, as the portions are small, but rather it's a wine bar with a fabulous menu. Great place to enjoy and share with a small group of friends.
We ordered the Jerusalem artichoke soup, smoked salmon crostini, the cod dish,
the steak dish, and scallop tartare with squid ink. Everything was delicious, all the meats were juicy and tender, and there was much attention to detail put into the presentation of each dish. The wine is also great!
Chef/owner Danny is very attentive and friendly.
They also offer a brunch menu on the weekend.
I will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"Glas is an intimate wine, appetizer and dessert bar at 1118 Queen St. East. It's the perfect spot for a first date or a light night out. The first time I was there was with my cousin: I ordered a slice of their chocolate cake and a glass of red. Both were delicious (I'm still learning about wine but I'm an expert on cake). My cousin is gluten intolerant and Chef Danny was kind enough to put together something special for her. The second time I went was for a first date. Again, the wine was lovely, and this time, Danny sent gourmet  cherries to our table. A welcome addition to the Leslieville community. http://www.girlabouttoronto.com/?s=glas"}
{"text":"Glas Wine Bar is a petite Italian-style diner off of Queen East. 

My sister took me here for a belated birthday dinner on a weekday evening; we tried the 4-course vegetarian tasting menu, which was $40, per person. I was impressed that Dan, the owner and chef, asked us if we had any personal preferences when it came to ingredients, flavours, etc. Despite having been vegan years ago, I don't hold back on my love of cheese; my sister, however, preferred a minimal amount of eggs and milk. 

Every dish was fantastic! We started off with a carrot-ginger soup, topped with creme fraiche and chives. Our second dish - my favourite - was celery root, shaved into papperadelle, with a dollop of black truffle sauce. It reminds me of raw zucchini spaghetti! The third dish, macaroni and cheese with onions and butternut squash was nice, but I can't say I tasted any squash. Both the celery root and pasta dish were too salty for my sister's liking, but I liked both as they were. To each their own! And the last plate - poached pear with cocoa sauce - was definitely very tasty and had a wonderful flavour to it.

Everything was freshly prepared and served once ready. You can even watch the cook at work! As well, Dan is also a wonderfully considerate host who makes the dining experience that much more authentic. Will definitely revisit in the summer and bring others here."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars 
VIBE 
The renovation of Frankly Eatery into Glas was a great idea and I think the space works way better as a wine bar. It's a small intimate space with the kitchen right next to the dining area. It's a great spot for a date and to come with girlfriends. 

Chef Danny really welcomes you in as if you were walking into his home. He speaks with everyone and is just a really generous guy. 

THE GOODS 
I like that the plates are small so you can share them. If you're looking for appetizers, I really liked the soup (I think it changes regularly) and the crostini with cheese and tomato drizzled with olive oil. It was very fresh! 

The mains are also small. I had the Nova Scotian Sea Bream and it was the perfect mix of saltiness and crunchy texture. There was an almond sauce that accompanied the dish and the sweetness worked with the saltiness of the taste. 

The wine selection is small for a wine bar but I like that it's not an overwhelming list. I also like the options of Canadian selections. I had the Riesling but with the sea bream, I'd pick the Pino Grigio next time. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Usually, I'd be sarcastic over the mis-spelling of the word \"glass.\" But if Danny named the bar, \"glass\" it would sound aggressive right? That said, the food, wine and atmosphere is worth the missing \"s'! 
Nice addition to Leslieville and I hope it lasts longer than Frankly Eatery!"}
{"text":"3.5 Star

The friendly and attentive service here worth that extra 0.5 star.

I really enjoyed Glas Wine Bar's Veggielicious 2013 Menu - $38 4 course

- Parsnip and apple soup with grape must reduction and torn toasted croutons
- Variation of local beet salad with potatoes, marinated red onion, vegan aioli and broccoli sprouts
- Celery root pappardelle with Italian black truffle and arugula emulsion
- White wine poached pear in cocoa sauce with cinnamon scented croutons

We also order for the meat lover:
Pan seared Ontario Flatiron steak with variation of red pepper, sauteed yukon gold potatoes scented with rosemary ($21)

And washed those down with:
Featherstone Black Sheep Riesling, Niagara Peninsula (2012) -$6
Muscedere Cabernet Franc, Lake Erie North Shore (2010) - $6.50

The vegetarian dish were all well prepared, nicely plated and interesting. However the steak was really meh with not much flavour. The ingredients used here is freshly and locally sourced including their wine selection!

The set up of Glas Wine Bar is really cozy. Dining here is just like having dinner at a friend's house. Menu changes weekly so great for repeat visit!"}
