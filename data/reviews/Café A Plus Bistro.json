Café A Plus Bistro has a bit of everything, with their main specialty being tea. As you can see above, the cafe sells a variety of teas, coffee, and other goodies. I took a quick look at them, and I can't wait to come back and buy some, as I love collecting tea.

Another reason why I love this cafe is because they sell waffles here. I didn't order one when I visited but it's on my must-try list for this cafe. Aside from waffles, fresh juices, sandwiches, and more are available for takeout or for dine-in. The sandwiches look very fresh and good in my opinion, and I read that they sell sandwiches on Fairmount bagels here, so that's another plus!

Hubby and I ordered our drinks and we looked around the cafe a little bit. Not only do they have seats on the ground floor, the cafe also had a second floor with more tables and seats for customers. We decided to see what's upstairs...

We were both impressed with their second floor and we happily decided to enjoy our time upstairs. There were sofas to lounge in, magazines for reading, clean tables to work at... what more do you need in a cafe? With free wifi, this is my ultimate hide-out.

We were both very satisfied with our drinks. My matcha latte was very well done, complete with foam and everything. I was a little disappointed with the size of my latte though; for the price, I felt like it was a little overpriced but I suppose it's because of the import of Japanese tea leaves. Hubby's long espresso was very satisfactory! My husband isn't fond of light coffee, and at Café A Plus Bistro, it seemed heavenly. The aroma of the coffee was great, the crema was well done, and overall the flavours of the espresso was in our opinion, one of the best in Montreal. None of the acidic stuff here! If you're like us, you'd like coffee and espresso here.

Overall, Café A Plus Bistro is a great addition to Old Montreal's cafe scene. The two-story cafe is definitely not very well known (yet) but we wouldn't be surprised if it's full of students and professionals the next time we visit. Yes, Cafe Tommy is just a block away, but I think I'd come here from time to time because the drinks are better and it's much easier to find seating."}
