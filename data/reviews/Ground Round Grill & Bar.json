{"text":"Stopped in for dinner before catching a movie at the Atlas. There were maybe 4 or 5 other tables of people in the place, max. We asked if the happy hour was still going on (main reason for coming) abd were told yes, then asked of we wanted bar or table. We chose a table, and waited 15 minutes for the waitress to acknowledge is. To the point were we were about to get up (I think she heard us becsuse that's when she stopped talking to abother waitress and came over.) She was rude and quickly took our orders, when i tried to ask what drinks were part of happy hour, she informed me they only honor at the bar...Ok, shouldn't that have been mentioned when we asked about happy hour when we came in? Anyways, she promised to be right back with drinks. We saw others getting baskets of popcorn, we were never offered any. It took twenty minutes to get our drinks, then another twenty to get the food even though we ordered all at the same time, and she didnt even bring it, another waitress did. She literally saw us staring her down for drink refills and walked around to avoid our table (I wish I was joking)...The food was blah and we were really kind of upset by this time. Just wanted to pay and leave before we missed our movie.....I finally had to pull a flag down and  \"Excuse me!\", to get her to stop from rushing by our table again. She got the receipt and then disappeared again. I tried flagging her down so she could run my card and correct the order since she charged us for two drinks (I got water, since when is that $3.99?)  finally giving up and we dug out the exact change and I wrote her a note advising there would be no tip  and here was the exact amount less the incorrect drink charge. I did notice as we walked out she ran to the table, probably thinking we ran out on the check.   I have worked various forms of customer service for almost ten years. I know waitressing sucks but so do many other jobs. If you want to make a living you should be courteous and do your job. If you hate it that much maybe you should find another industry to work in.I was still going to leave her a tip because I know most live off of tips but she wouldn't come to run the card and I wasnt going to chase her down again to try and give a tip. Yea, definitely our first and last experience with this place."}
{"text":"Even though the restaurant is by Midway Mall, which is a modern day Scooby Doo ghost town, it is Da Bomb!!!  The burgers are D-Lish-Us!  As Kris Kross (RIP) once wrote, I missed the bus, but i'm never ever ever gonna miss an opportunity to have a great meal at an affordable price at the Ground Round again!"}
{"text":"I never made it to Ground Round in their first incarnation but I certainly like this one. Nice decor, lots of TVs, and attentive staff. The menu was surprisingly varied but I tend to judge a place on their burgers. We skipped appetizers since the dessert offerings were intriguing but I did get a frozen strawberry margarita. A bit watered down but I've had worse. The hickory bacon burger on a ciabatta roll was fantastic. The kettle chips were a bit bland and I asked the waitress to bring me some flavored sour cream and they were much better after that. My girlfriend ordered the pot roast and french onion soup and said they were both very good. For dessert we chose the triple sampler of fried oreos, fried cheesecake, and cinnamon dippers. It came with chocolate sauce, strawberry sauce, and icecream and was very good. We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I never expect much from a chain restaurant.  I expected even less since we went in there at like 11pm.  I feel weird saying I had an amazing burger at a chain place...BUT IT WAS AMAZING.  Everything was good.  The waitress was great.  This place deserves your business!"}
{"text":"Does not live up to the standards of the old restaurants...... Chef does not know how to leave salt out even when requested... Everything our table of four ordered, could not be eaten, like licking a salt block.... Save your heart avoid this restaurant, until they improve recipes...."}
