{"text":"Casbah has been our long term favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh over the years and we try to fit it in for every anniversary and birthday. The arugula salad with pancetta is our favorite but we also always enjoy the changing seasonal entrees. Each dish is a work of art and to truly experience it you must try to get a small bit of every little flavor on your fork to experience the artistry together.   The one complaint is a major one to us... the chairs in the patio area absolutely destroy your back! We are in our 30s and do not have back issues, but the metal garden chairs without padding are so terrible! It's a shame to spend $150+ on a dinner for 2 and leave in pain because of poor chairs. We learned this lesson early on and always asked for inside seating, but I hadn't been there for awhile and just booked a table through the website and ended up in the patio. I'm going to need to see a chiropractor after dinner tonight.   It kills me to say anything bad about our long term favorite place in the city, but comfort is an important part of dining and I think the patio chairs need to go to keep up with the quality and price that comes with the food."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. My husband and I went here a few days ago. We liked the outdoor area that was \"open tent\" - when we come back we would like to sit out there (weather permitting, of course). The beginning bread basket and goat cheese/salted butter was fantastic! We started with the calamari, which had a delicious lemon aioli sauce coupled with an Italian sweet and sour sauce. The combo was delectable! My husband had the duck, which was juicy and tender. I had the cavatelli, which was fantastic on a rainy day. My white wine flight was wonderful! We will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Went there to celebrate my birthday. The food was outstanding and the service was paced to my liking. I'm a sucker for soft shell crabs and theirs require a return visit. My wife had the gnocchi and they were some of the best. Their draft beer selection was good but could of catered to some of the local microbrews in the Pittsburgh region.  Other than that and overall great day."}
{"text":"I went on a date with my girlfriend here, and it was a great experience.  Charming outside dining area with excellent service and a knowledgeable staff.  I will say that the food was a bit overpriced, but that's to be expected in Shadyside.  Great selection of fresh seafood - I had the salmon and it was delicious.  Reasonably priced wine list, as well. I would recommend Casbah for a special event or if you're rolling in the $$."}
{"text":"Not a good vegan experience.  We were meeting friends at Casbah for dinner -their choice.  Since I follow a version of vegan, I called ahead and was assured that they had vegan versions of a couple of pasta dishes.  Server was very cooperative and said she would instruct the kitchen to omit the meat and  increase the veggies on their cavatelli.   Well, they omitted the meat, but I was left with one of the smallest servings of pasta that I have ever seen.  At about $20, it was close to the price of caviar!"}
{"text":"1. Sat outside on patio metallic chairs and tables, when we made reservation expecting to sit in the restaurant, not outside! There was no information about this. If the restaurant inside seats g is full. Then they should mention to the customers making reservations that they will be sitting outside!!! 2. Food is mediocre at best! They even screwed my order. Asked for risotto and got some pasta, not sure what. 3. Asked for two cabs, someone at restaurant changed it to one big cab instead which could not hold all of us so we had to wait for another 25 mins for another one!!  Would not recommend to anyone. Enough other good restaurants in Pittsburgh to go to. They have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly!"}
{"text":"Great great for parties and celebrations of all kinds.  The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable of the menu and the wine list.  The Food is creative and many of the items are organic or locally grown.  Everything is so fresh and pretty, you almost don't want to eat it.  The wine list is extensive, and although it can be pricey, they have great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Last night was the first time that we had been to Casbah in a long time - we used to absolutely love it, but a couple of disappointing brunch and dinner experiences had put us off of it. However, we decided to give it another chance, and I am glad that we did.   Even though we had a reservation, we were seated (without them asking us our preference) in the front area, but that was fine, since the heaters kept it toasty warm. It was also a great table thanks to our terrific waitress. Wow, was she cheerful and friendly! She was also helpful with making recommendations - when I asked her about the cocktails, she pointed out the relatively new \"Beet and Potato,\" which had beet-infused vodka as one of the main ingredients. It was a cool cocktail - an interesting blend of savory and sweet, and very seasonally appropriate. I don't know if I would order it again, but I'm very glad I had it once.  For dinner, I ended up having a soup and then an appetizer, since I wasn't too hungry. The caramelized onion soup was so warming - it was like an update of the classic french onion soup. The broth was not too salty (a common problem with onion soups), and the onions had been braised perfectly. Everything was just the right texture as the onions, broth, and \"crouton\" blended together.  I ordered the sheep's milk gnudi for my main course. Even though it came in an appetizer-sized portion, it was still a lot of food, since the gnudi are so filling. The gnudi were nicely molten in the middle, and just the right softness on the outside. There were a variety of accompaniments to the gnudi, but the standouts were the brussel sprouts. I'm actually not a huge fan of sprouts, but I ate every one in the dish. They were light and buttery, solid but not rock-hard, and had just a trace amount of bitterness left. That is how sprouts should taste!  Even though I didn't plan on ordering dessert, I ended up getting the warm walnut baklava with cinnamon ice cream. The warmth of the baklava melted the ice cream nicely, and the flavors just blended together on the plate. The baklava was quite traditional in its assembly and spice blend, but the extra cinnamon with cream gave the whole dessert just a bit of extra oomph.  In summary, I'm glad that we gave Casbah another try. I wish that they would go back to offering all of their pastas in both entree and appetizer sizes, and I miss the crazy variety of wine flights that they used to have (it seems like they just have 4 now), but it's still a great dinner destination."}
{"text":"Food is simple and delicious, although the service was awful when I went.  Highly recommend the veal and pork meatball appetizer, such a great combination of flavors and textures."}
{"text":"very refined service  excellent desserts  nice salads - not a fan of the cuisine - nothing against casbah"}
{"text":"Went to Casbah for Valentine's Day dinner with my wife.  Had never been here before but heard good things.  We both decided on the Valentines day tasting menu which consisted of a variety of amazing courses.  I had scallops which were so moist and delicious.  The second course had torteloni (sp?) with beef and mushrooms, and lamb for the entree.  It was so tender and cooked perfectly.    I would absolutely go back and would highly recommend this restaurant for an authentic mediterrean experience."}
{"text":"What's not to like. Top shelf bar. Ever changing great wine by the glass selections. I have been here a half dozen times as I visit Pittsburgh. If I lived here I would live at Casbah. The food is so good you can hear me moaning in Ohio. There is absolutely nothing that is not amazing. I eat at the bar and Oliver and Amanda consistently recommend food and wine pairings to die for. One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Casbah might be my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I went to dinner there a couple times, getting the gnocchi with duck confit the first couple times, because it was that good. All the flavors in that dish just work and who doesn't love duck confit and gnocchi? I did not like the short rib pasta, as I found it too salty. The long island duck was not my favorite, I found it a bit dry and needing a good punch of flavor, even with the sauce being there. The meatballs used the be the best bite I'd ever had, I think it was the charred brussel sprouts with them that made them so good, but then they changed them (now they are smaller meatballs) and now they are just okay. The calamari is so incredibly tender and the aioli is that perfect finishing touch, like when you squeeze lemon on fish.  Then, after like four visits, I was reading Yelp reviews and hearing about their pork chop. I thought to myself, \"Pork chops always taste the same, how could this one possibly be so good?\" I was intrigued, so I tried it anyway, and now I dream about that pork chop. I have already had it twice and you should try it, trust me. Words cannot describe how tender this pork chop was. You might be thinking, \"I've had a tender pork chop.\" Let me tell you, you have not. This pork chop will change your life and may be dangerous to have if you do not live in Pittsburgh where you will be able to get it again. My mother said the swordfish was the best swordfish she had ever had, but she still liked the pork chop better.  Then I went once for brunch when my family was in town. They brought out these lemon poppyseed scones (as like a bread basket) that my entire family still talk about a month later. They were THAT good. We even asked for more while there then took them to go. Fights were fought over these remaining scones.  Basically, I keep thinking Casbah is great, then it goes and proves to me it is even better than I think it is, exceeding every single expectation I could ever have."}
{"text":"So, I had been wanting to try this place for some time.  I have never been disappointed by a big burrito restaurant, but I guess there's a first time for everything.  I ordered the softshell crab, as did three others in our party.  It was awful.  It was mushy on the inside, as though they hadn't taken the gills off.  I have made my own fried softshell crabs before (yes they were alive, and yes I cut their faces off), so I'm no stranger to how they should be prepared and how they should taste.  We each only had a few bites and when we told the waiter how bad it was, he didn't really do anything about it.  Anyway, I'm never going back here.  Sub par at best, go to ANY of the other big burrito restaurants."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience. Food was mostly very good. My sweet pea risotto was just OK. My wife's short rib ravioli was creative and very tasty. Neither of us are big eaters, but noted how small the portions were, especially compared to the price. One cup of risotto for $20+? Four ravioli for the same?  They altered the desert recipe on request, which for sure was over and above the call.  Service was attentive and the setting nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Casbah. We had our first date here, he proposed here, we had our first anniversary dinner at Casbah not to mention numerous brunches and dinners over the last 5 or so years. We are big fans of all the Big Burrito restaurants, but we have been especially pleased with the service and food at Casbah. Since they added valet service, that's one more thing you don't have to worry about. Very good portions sizes, well prepared food, and let me emphasize again- phenomenal service. Use your birthday coupon or have your special night out here!"}
{"text":"I live in New York City and I extremely regret venturing to this awful city. This is the worst fucking experience I've ever had at a wine room. I am standing waiting for our table 15 minutes past our time."}
{"text":"Another one of Pittsburgh's finest restaurants.  The best things about Casbah are it's very cool atmosphere, good service (a very friendly hostess and knowledgeable server).  I had a wine flight (they have a good wine selection), and several appetizers, soups and salad.  Everything was delicious, especially the complimentary bread and they olive oil-based stuff you can put on it.  Most of the ingredients come from local farms and food suppliers, and I really liked they even gave them credit on the menu, the first time I have ever seen that in a restaurant (shouldn't they deserve at least as much credit as the chef? After all, they spend months growing the stuff chefs spend maybe seconds using).  The atmosphere is really cool, I recommend sitting out on the patio in summer.  The only negative things I can say about Casbah is the high price for relatively little food and the misleading name (I expected more of a Middle Eastern menu and vibe)."}
{"text":"Casbah is my absolute favorite restaurant!! I love the sort rib ravioli. The beet salad is terrific and the rasberry bread pudding is to die for! The valet service is a nice touch so you don't have to worry about parking!! One of the times I am going to make it to the brunch!!"}
{"text":"This place used to have a great bar/tapas menu with a decent selection of happy hour wine specials.  Now...  not so much.  Well, during HH, you can get any of the wines under $10 for $5.  Selection by the glass is limited.    As for their menu/dinner - this is totally a different story.  I haven't really been disappointed yet!  The appetizers/small plates all pretty good, I really like the chevre croquettes ($7).  The salads are good and although I haven't gotten the soup anytime lately, I hear great things from my friends.  The entrees are always excellent - I usually tend to stick to the seafood (halibut, $29) and never have been disappointed (and importantly, nothing has ever been overcooked).  The signature orecchiette dish ($20) is soooo delicious - just ignore the fact that it is a heart attack waiting to happen - it's worth it.  The desserts are ok, personally, I feel that you would be better advised to stick to filling up on the entrees.    Oh, and let me recommend the blood orange martini if they have it - very very yummy!  And it is nice that you can order Veuve Cliquot by the glass ($16).  Prices are a bit high for what you'd expect for Pittsburgh, but considering the quality of food, I would recommend it.  P.S. I have heard that they have a great brunch on Sundays. I personally haven't tried it, but with the number of compliments I hear, it's probably worth the try!  ------------------------- Update 12/9/07:  Went to the brunch.  What a great deal!  For $22, you get a choice of alcoholic beverage (bloody mary, mimosa, bellini) as well as a starter and then the entree.  They have a lot of choices, so be prepared to just try one and come back again to try the other stuff!  The smoked salmon appetizer was good although with too much mayonnaise sauce and for me, too much onion.  The truffled potato was yummy.  The arugula salad was as delicious as ever!  And for entree, we both got the Casbah benedict.  I have to admit that neither of us was blown away, but it was good and filling.  I think that we will both be back to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Food phenomenal! Service can be hit or miss."}
{"text":"I went to Casbah for the first time in December, and it was SO COLD! I was shivering the entire time. Luckily, I had delicious cocktails to warm me up! I loved their drinks selection!  I got the short rib ravioli, and it was probably one of the best dishes I've ever had in Pittsburgh. I just loved it. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly!   The atmosphere and space is great - open and large. I had dressed up a bit, but many patrons were dressed extremely casual."}
{"text":"My wife and I go to Casbah every year for my birthday. It is my favorite of the Big  Burrito restaurants, and they have a birthday deal for $30 off an entree.   This time I started with the Parsnip & Chestnut Soup, garnished with braised chicken, arugula & almond pesto. It was divine, with the rich sweetness for which parsnips are noted. My main course was Elysian Fields Farm Lamb Loin with flageolet beans, merguez sausage, turnips, greens and whole grain mustard. It was cooked perfectly pink, as ordered, and the flavors complemented each other.  For dessert, I skipped my usual chocolate - they offered Chocolate Mousse, Chocolate Cheesecake and Dark Chocolate Raspberry Bread Pudding. I decided to try the Pumpkin Bread with Butter Rum Sauce and Cream Cheese Ice Cream.  The cake was light and tasty and the ice cream and sauce were excellent."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service.  We had two entrees.  Duck was outstanding.  Campanelle (sp) pasta ok but needed more flavor including salt.  Overall a good night.  So one dish was a 5 and one was a 3."}
{"text":"Very good food and another great place for happy hour. Highly recommended. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"AMAZING! We heard Casbah had the best Calamari in Pittsburgh so we just had to try. So when we made a trip to Pittsburg in late summer this was one of our first stops. Had the calamari, and it was OUTSTANDING! Its nice and crisp and has that crunchy but not overpowering outer fryer coating, and then it had this lemon aoli that was under it. And just on the edges there was this sweet chili sauce with just enough spice, if you took up a piece, dipped it in the lemon, and then the chili, it was one of the best things I have ever eaten, and I have eaten some good stuff. After the calamari we chose their three course lunch meal for only $16. For $16 you get so much amazing food! It starts out with a cup of soup, I chose the squash purée, and oh my goodness was it good! It was this thick purée of butternut squash but it had toasted sesame on top and had some very developed rich flavors. After he soup I got half swordfish sandwich and again, AMAZING! I'm a sucker for swordfish so I may not be the most unbiased person, but it was soooo good! It had a nice medium rare swordfish steak on two nicely toasted pieces of homemade bread, and on top was clean and crisp vegetables to make the whole meal so light, and there was this dressing on it that words can't describe. My final course was the gnocchi, and I was literally speechless after just one bit of this heavenly gnocchi. I mean I have been talking this place up, but this gnocchi was to die for. I literally told the waitress, I would die for just one more bite. It was like little pillows of goodness in this rich sauce with shagbark hickory nuts and hen of the woods mushrooms. The strong flavor of the hickory nuts and the woods mushrooms compliments the softness of the gnocchi perfectly! Oh, and it had rich duck configue in it and the nice meaty duck left you feeling full afterwards. Overall, amazing restaurant, I have been back 2 times since then and have been astounded by their food every time. I highly recommend this to anyone with $16 and a tongue."}
{"text":"I can't believe all the high reviews.  Either you work for Big Burrito or it's amateur hour.  The food tasted terrible.  It was bland and over-salted and reminded me of the Olive Garden.  If you like Casbah more power to you but for me never again."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! I'd never been to Casbah before until this past Sunday when we decided to check it out for their prix-fixe menu.  For $22, you get your choice of alcoholic brunch beverage, an appetizer and an entree. An incredible price for a serious amount of great food. They had many options on their fixed menu - something for everyone. From huge waffles and omelets to lamb dishes, fish and the usual brunch regulars such as eggs benedict too. The appetizers list was equally as large.   I started with a bloody mary. Was a nice middle ground between heavy and light - and it had some kick to it. Very good. For an appetizer I got the cheese and fruit plate with french baguette slices. There was a soft brie-like goat cheese, a blue cheese and a mild dry sheeps milk cheese as well. All were wonderful. For my entree I went with the Salmon Eggs Benedict. It was perfect. The fruit on the side was fresh cut, and the home fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  I tasted a couple of other things as well. Both the polenta and the mushroom soup on the appetizer list were great. Didn't try any of the other entrees, but everyone seemed pleased. The only complaint was from a friend that ordered the truffle omelet - and it was that he thought they went too heavy on truffle oil, drowning out the eggs.   Also, service was absolutely perfect. We had a tall waiter, forget his name, but he was one of the most professional servers I've ever had. The table was cleared and cleaned immediately...he was never pushy, always friendly, and had great suggestions. One of the best experiences I've had for restaurant service anywhere.  For brunch in Pittsburgh, this is my favorite so far. Not to be missed!  Now I just need to make plans to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good.  Comparable to any 3 to 3.5 star restaurant.  The lamb is definitely good.  And it is definitely a good date restaurant.  I would rather give it 3.5 stars since I've definitely eaten at better restaurants. But for Pittsburgh, it ranks pretty high up."}
{"text":"Overall, consistent flavorful food. I've been here more than 10 occasions. The Cioppino seems to be their signature, great for lunch and supper that goes well with Syrah or Pinot, or cold Sauvignon Blanc. The Long Island Duck never ever disappoints, goes well with Malbec. The wait staff needs some reminding however, that a delay in bringing in the food cools them down (especially during busy nights): the right food temp is essential to gustatory delight."}
{"text":"Really 4+ stars.  I was taken to Casbah for a business dinner and swooned over how good it was.  Coming from New York City and knowing that Pittsburgh was foodie heaven, I was still not expecting something this good.  I had two appetizers (in order to leave room for dessert):  the grilled octopus on a bed of shaved fennel, prosciutto, and orange was light and tasty, and the bucatini with shrimp was rich and satisfying.  The semifreddo with a chocolate macaron was good, though not of the same quality as the other courses.  The cioppino looked and tasted wonderful (I was given a perfectly cooked scallop), but the pork chop that evening was undercooked (who eats medium rare pork???).  I wonder why the wine list is so extravagantly expensive, even by London or New York standards ?!?!?!  The Nietto malbec in the $40 range was voluptuous.  But doe many of the wines are i the $70-$150 range!"}
{"text":"Pricey? Yes. Delicious? YES. Although this is not a place I'll be able to go to often (due to the price), I can say that my duck was cooked to perfection. Will definitely be back (preferably after a pay day)."}
{"text":"Dinner Saturday night was excellent. The server was on his game and the chef out did him/her-self. Drinks were perfect, food perfect for all four of us and again service was excellent."}
{"text":"So I hated this Soba place owned by the same people, and I happen to stumble into this joint for lunch. It had a great sandwich (crab) and the soup was pretty decent (cream of cauliflower). Not sure how they are owned by the same people as Soba (I mean, obviously different chefs) but usually the same owner means similar quality and price, no?  Maybe the dishes are just hit and miss, and I got a hit here, whereas I had a serious miss over at Soba.  In any case, the crab sandwich was good-- nice, large chunks of crab.  No overkill on the sauce.  The soup was likewise good.  I don't understand how the two restaurants could possibly be related given the night and day of my food experience!  The wine, however, was overpriced for the quality.  I guess people aren't from SF and expect good wines for the same price!  Save your money, buy a nice $40-60 bottle at home and have a much better vino experience but pay less (or the same!)."}
{"text":"So I went back to Casbah for dinner and was totally underwhelmed. The granola I had for brunch (in my previous review) was better than my entire dinner put together. The service was better at dinner then at brunch, but the food made my rating drop from five stars (probably a little generous) to three stars. Definitely go for brunch! But it's not worth the money for dinner. Mediocre food in a nice atmosphere with good service is still mediocre food..."}
{"text":"Casbah is fast becoming my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I have been there twice now and both times the service and food was impeccable.   The calamari and the proscuitto appetizer are a great start to the meal and not too heavy or filling and I could eat a whole basket of the warm bread. I'd love to know where they get it from as I can't imagine they bake it there, but maybe they do!   The pork chop is their signature dish and does not disappoint. My husband had the duck the last time we were there and it was juicy on the inside and had a great crispy skin. I had the red pepper casereccia and was thrilled with the amount of seafood in the dish. There were 4 HUGE, delicious scallops and a ton of lump crab. Very impressive. I was there with a group of 6 this time and everyone had clean plates at the end of the meal.   I like the fact that it seems like the menu changes with the seasons. The proteins may stay static, but since they use a lot of local ingredients, the accompaniments/side dishes might be different every time you come. Honestly, this is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. I plan on trying it for brunch or lunch sometime soon."}
{"text":"I had my first experience with Casbah on a recent Friday night in a group of 4 without a reservation arriving around 9pm. Here is a summary of our experience:   PROS:  - Ambiance is nice, upscale, not too loud.  - We were able to find a low table in the bar within 15 minutes.  - Drinks were good, generously proportioned. Cocktails were priced as expected for the type of place ($10-$14). Wine list had multiple options by the glass. - As for the meal, the meats were good cuts, well prepared.   CONS:  - Overall the food felt rich with creams, fats, salt without any particular inspiration showing through. The ingredients were all good and well sourced, but the finished products did not seem to elevate them in any particular way.  - The service was high end of amateur - not what I was expecting from this caliber of restaurant. Our 30 minute wait stretched to 1hr 30min without any meaningful acknowledgement by the staff. Upon sitting we were told that they usually have \"excellent sourdough bread\", but they were out of it for tonight so we had ciabatta (which was fine, but we didnt need to hear what we didn't get to have).   FOOD: (vegetarian options reviewed directly, meat options as reported by dining companions) - Cheese plate: Nicely prepared with a good range of cheeses. Only complaint was that the cheeses were served too cold to fully appreciate them.  - Beet salad: the greens were good, the dressing was a bit too mild to offset the beets, the beets themselves were gritty and not particularly well cooked.  - Squash soup: Overall very good - quite rich but flavorful. Felt like the salt and cream were taking over the squash  - Mushroom pasta: Again quite rich and salty. Packed with high quality mushrooms but didn't feel that they were quite given justice due to the salt and butter. Pasta was high quality but again, overshadowed by the salt and butter.  - Steak: Good cut of meat, cooked well. - Ragu pasta: Excellent pasta dish well cooked, reported to be almost as good as Piccolo Forno's.   OVERALL:  A similar experience at 2/3 the price would have received 3 stars, for the price of the meal this was barely a 2 star event. We won't be going back, even with the lure of 2 for 1 entrees around our birthdays - the food just isn't that good even discounting the service. I'm sure they will continue to do well with a certain crowd, but there are much better dinner options out there."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, but high prices.  My date and I shared 2 appetizers, a salad and each had an entree with the recommended wine pairings. Bill was $115 without tax--pricey by my standards for this experience. The new tuna tartare appetizer was the highlight of our night. The bruschetta with fig and grape butter, prosciutto and blue cheese was good, so was the beet salad.  We were disappointed with our entrees. My roasted duck breast with spinach and gnocchi was not hot. My date had the salmon with potato fennel puree, which she said tasted fishy.  Make sure you aren't seated inside the tent where patrons are eating on a slope on outdoor metal tables--this is not my idea of a good dinner at this price range.  Although I would come here again, there are certainly much better restaurants in the city. I would rank Casbah below Eleven within the Big Burrito group of restaurants."}
{"text":"Tasty farm food and well cooked. Nice and warm garden especially in the winter. Long Island duck is excellent!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the \"hit or miss\" reviewers about Casbah, at least when it comes to the food. I came here for brunch last weekend with a big group. They were very accomodating to us throughout the reservation process and the brunch, which was good. And our waiter, Daniel, was great.   The previous reviewer who said the Bloody Mary is the best drink was spot-on. It had a great spice and was the only drink that seemed like it had any alcohol in it at all. The mimosa and sangria were very \"eh.\"   I loved my smoked salmon appetizer (and that did seem to be the hit at the table), but entrees around the table left people disappointed. The goat cheese and mushroom omelette could have had a heckuva lot more goat cheese and mushrooms, and my scallop/sausage/grits/egg dish just had way too much going on. The grits were actually fabulous, but the scallops were overcooked and got lost next to the scrambled eggs (?) and sage sausage crumbles.   If I lived in Pittsburgh, I could see myself coming back here for wine and appetizers, but I'm not sure I would make it a regular brunch or dinner spot."}
{"text":"Ate lunch at Casbah for the first time. Tried the Piccolo Gusto: $15 gets you a small choice of salad, a half sandwich and a half portion of a pasta or risotto. Great deal and fantastic food. Argula salad, shodt rib sandwich and wild mishroom/truffle risotto. No need for dinner today!"}
{"text":"Nice decor. Limited menu. Not impressed with the variety of selection. I had short rib ravioli which was just ok, v salty. Bf had roasted chicken which was good. The wine flight is a good deal but the selections again aren't that great."}
{"text":"It was suitable for a large business meeting and appeared mostly to be the clientele.  I ordered the cioppino and it was excellent.  My benchmark of seafood is the SF bay area.  It came with sourdough that was burnt and I was unsure why a quality of restaurant served charred bread.  Before the main course the bread, cheeses, and salad served piece meal fairly slowly."}
{"text":"Very good pistachio rissotto.  Yummy flat breads!  Interesting olives.    They took my friend's allergy (shellfish and fish) issues very seriously.    The patio is lovely!  We had a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Sat outside on a beautiful evening and felt a bit transported. Everything we got was delicious. Service was excellent and friendly, as I've come to expect from the Big Burrito Group of restaurants. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Love Casbah.  Been going there for years and have never had a less than great meal and service.  OF course their signature lamb is to die for (with the Stag's Leap Petite Syrah).  What can I say -- the cheese plate is great.  Everything is well-prepared and the service is among the best in the -burgh."}
{"text":"This is a great place for date night or dinner with the girls (or boys).  When it is warm out, you can't beat the outdoor patio area.  Definitely make a reservation.  They also have good service with knowledgeable wait staff.  We started with the cheese tray, it was delicious.  If you get it, ask for additional bread.  I got the beef short rib ravioli, which was nice for a cold evening.  Finished out the evening with a warm apple tart, which was delicious.   Overall, would not consider this an \"everyday\" place, but worthwhile to go to."}
{"text":"Updated: I just want to acknowledge that Casbah very promptly and very courteously followed up with our office regarding our catering order, and went above and beyond to make it right.  It certainly gives me tremendous confidence to dine there, and to use Casbah again for business function or catering.  Original: Had good experience dinning at Casbah - it's pricey, but the food was always good.  So we tried it for catering for lunch for a meeting for 12 people.  The quality is more uneven than the restaurant dinning experience.  The crab cake sandwich was excellent, the roast turkey sandwich was dry and unfortunately I bit into a 2 inch long black plastic piece (I think it's the wrapping of the turkey, which the slicer just sliced right off, and it made it into the sandwich).  I hope it's more of an exception to the norm, and will give it another shot.  I am impressed with their follow-up customer service."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a wonderful brunch today at Casbah. The food was delicious and our server, Tess was fantastic.    I had the baba ganoush hummus and my husband had the chickpea hummus. Tess overheard me say that I can't eat wheat and brought an extra plate of fresh veggies. For the entree I had the lamb, spinach and poached eggs and my husband had the two egg special. Both were so good, fresh and a nice portions.   We will definitely return even living about 45 minutes away."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the cheese platter, wine, and my vegetarian risotto. The service was good and the wine suggestion worked well. The portions are small for the price, but I guess that is somewhat expected for a restaurant of this type. It's a plus that they have enough vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. My bf n I went and had dinner for my birthday there, our waiter was rude,looked tired n sloppy like she didnt want to be at work, she rolled her eyes whenever we need assistance  n rushed us threw our menus...the food was good but nothing amazing..."}
{"text":"Best \"Babaganoush\" we've had since we visited Egypt. The gaspacho soup was fantastic, and since my husband wouldn't share his short rib ravioli, I can only assume they were suburb also.  The atmosphere was a tad basic, but it was also different and therefore interesting and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Outstanding.   Good table, romantic, nice touches.  Excellent food, prompt, friendly, and knowledgable service."}
{"text":"I love all of their menu options, especially the duck. Drink selection and desserts are also always good. My only complaint occurs when I'm not dining in and simply trying to drive past the place, the valet service causes a bit of traffic on S Highland Ave because there's only room for one car at a time to pull up to valet."}
{"text":"Great food  had a assortment. Of things and all prepared  excellent. The service  very helpful on telling you the menu.   Will go back again"}
{"text":"Casbah is definitely my favorite restaurant in P-burgh; in fact, usually when I go somewhere else I wind up regretting that I didn't just go to Casbah. Every dish I've had has been excellent; some favorites are the sheep's milk gnudi, tuna tartare, arugala salad, bread pudding, and pretty much every soup. The short rib ravioli is a must have although arguably a touch salty. The menu is so inventive!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Big Burrito restaurant and definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the country.   Gotta be honest, though. Just about every time I'd been here, it's with colleagues, which means lots and lots of boozing!! Therefore, consequently, as a result, in sum, I don't have a crystal clear memory of what I had for appetizer, entree, dessert, etc.   What I can tell you is that I had never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here. And believe you me, if the food is not that good, I will remember it no matter how drunk I am. Sure, it's not exactly a \"Mediterranean\" restaurant, but who cares? The food is great, it's in a super cute hood, the atmosphere is cozy and comfy, and the service is always spot on.   I do recall that the very last time I ate here was with a dear friend and two of her British colleagues, and we had ourselves a grand ol' time. I had the arugula --one of my favorite words. It's lovely, no? Say it with me. A -ru-gu-la! Fun, right?!! And so flavorful!! --salad and cioppino, which was outstanding with super freshy fresh ingredients. What about dessert, you ask? Sorry, kids. By that time I really was drunk, and I can't remember. It was super tasty, though! I remember everyone liking mine the best. Sure do, sugar!  So pay no mind to others' taxonomy quip and give this place a whirl. It's a great date or small group place. Oh, and super fantastic wine list, too!"}
{"text":"Nice outdoor patio dining area.  Short rib ravioli was great.  The halibut was also very good."}
{"text":"Rock the Casbah! Rock the Casbah!   A group of us went to the Casbah for a girls' (and one guy) lunch.  It has been ages since I've been to the Casbah, and since I live clear across the country, I was looking forward to going back.    All of us enjoyed our meals -- many ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Chopped Salad or the Wild Mushroom and Goat Cheese Omelet.  Both were nice portions. I was fixated on the Orecchiette Pasta, grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Capriole goat cheese, sage cream, and it was a home run!  (I wasn't watching calories that day!)    Service was excellent . . . surprisingly so, especially with a table of eleven, a bunch of \"Sallies\" and one \"Harry\" if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Everything we had from their menu was fantastic.  Nice atmosphere, great wait staff. Truley an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Hey do I really need to review this place? Look at the previous reviews but I will let you know that they have a great lunch deal, the piccolo gusto menu. I highly recommend it because it is a heck of a deal and you can have tastes of a few different items so it pairs well with my self diagnosis of A.D.D. no offense to anyone who has A.D.D but it definitely kept my attention throughout my lunch experience. First off the service was excellent very attentive server who was really a foodie, which I really appreciated. She knew a heck of a lot about the seemingly simple dishes I had ordered. The Piccolo Forno allows for a choice of Salad or soup, a pasta or risotto, half sandwich. I went with a taste of the Pea Tendrils and Frisee Salad, while slightly complex to eat, it had a savory flavor from the light dressing and blue cheese crumbles, then I went with cauliflower risotto which was riculous. That is how you make risotto people. For the half samich I went with the half turkey. The turkey wasn't just a normal turkey slice from the deli counter this was actually very nicely trimmed meat off of a bird that was prepared in house and it was immediately noticeable. All this for $15 dollars, I'll take it....And I'll do it again many times over again. Come here for lunch sometime and check it for yourself."}
{"text":"Casbah was a great dining experience. It was recommended to me by a friend and it didn't disappoint. I went with my BF for Valentines day dinner. We went early so there wasn't much of a crowd. But the complimentary Valet service was still a plus in the below-zero weather. The service was attentive. Prices are not cheap but it was worth it. Portion sizes are reasonable.   We started out with the cheese plate appetizer. But honestly, the complimentary bread with salted butter and soft, house-made goat cheese was delicious -- better than the cheese plate. They offered apple butter, fig spread and some type of compote to accompany the cheeses.   For entrees, we got the Strozzapretti and the Long Island Duck. I'm a vegetarian and the waiter recommended the strozzapretti pasta, which was amazing. My taste buds were spoiled for the rest of the night. It was dressed in a flavorful, parmesan butter sauce. The only complaint I had was that the ricotta was too mild for the dish so I added some of the goat cheese that came with the free bread. My BF was pleased with his meal and but gave it 4/5 stars.   All the desserts looked great. We chose the milk sponge cake with mascarpone cream and ice cream. The sponge texture was a little too hard, but the other components were excellent.   Overall, it was delicious. I plan to go back for lunch, which is much cheaper."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Casbah for the first time recently and we both enjoyed our experience.  The atmosphere is dressy, but the restaurant isn't so formal that it feels stuffy or uncomfortable, which is a welcome change compared to most classy restaurants.  The environment was relaxed, and it was easy to have a quiet conversation throughout the meal.  As for the meal itself, we had a reservation and were promptly seated when we showed up.  Our waiter was courteous and provided good, fast service without being overbearing or constantly hovering, which was quite nice.  For an appetizer, we ordered the cheese tray which was tasty as well as fun and unique.  Following the cheese tray, I dined on the cioppino while my girlfriend had the casereccia.  Both dishes were tasty and our seafood was skillfully cooked, particularly the sea bass in my dish which was delicious.  I'd recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to celebrate an occasion or have some good, out of the ordinary food."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh; I've never been disappointed after dining at Casbah! We received a gift card and enjoyed a fabulous dinner starting with the mussels appetizer in a tomato based sauce.  Yum!  And then I had lamb loin with sweet potatoes and brussel spouts and cherry sauce.  What a beautiful presentation and taste.  My husband had the pasta with scallops and crabmeat.  He was equally pleased with his dish. We really liked the wine selection too!  We had cappuccino for our dessert, and it was the perfect ending to the meal.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Out of towners that happened to stumble upon this gem. Thanks, Siri. Wow! What a great experience. Fantastic, wine, food and service."}
{"text":"I'd put Casbah at no. 5 on the BB Group ranking.  So yeah that's not too high but I genuinely think nos. 1 through 4 (Soba, Umi, Eleven, Kaya) are more fun and more imaginative. The sticking point for me here is playing it too safe. Nothing I've had at Casbah has ever been poorly executed or off-putting, it's just that few offerings take any risks.   Here's what I do like:  the patio, cheese boards, wine list, beer list, local ingredients, the seared ahi, and most of the appetizers.  I'm not as much a fan of the cocktails, the service, and the brunch offerings.   But more than anything I just want to be challenged and surprised more often.  Everything is pretty much as you'd expect, and obviously one could do far worse than Casbah.  But if I'm the ~$30 entree territory, I want something to get really excited about."}
{"text":"Really like this restaurant. I have been there a million times and the food is very good every time. The ambiance is also fun, and then drinks are yummy."}
{"text":"Went here on father's day with my best friend and it was oddly not crowded at 11:30am on a Sunday. Anyway, we got the Brunch prix fixed meal with mimosas! Yum. We sat outside and it was just a nice cool environment with the overhang of plants and vines.   For my 2 courses I got the cinnamon polenta which is basically like oatmeal but much more creamier. IT was honestly, amazing. I loved it. It came with some almonds and some cranberries, but the polenta itself was great. I would come back just to have that for breakfast. For the main dish i got a crab omelette. It came with fresh fruit and potato fingerlings. The potatoes were great and the omelette was ok. Not the best I have had, but any place with crab in an omelette should get credit.  It was a great brunch and i was stuffed by the end. This place was courteous and the waitress was attentive but not overbearing. We had a great time here and it's just a nice place to relax."}
{"text":"Started with the Cheese Plate then the Octopus then the Duck, finishing with the Chocolate S'More Cake. Great experience especially the service. Robert was spot on! I'll be dreaming about this in the future."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Casbah for my birthday this March. This is one of our twice-a-year splurges and I have been wanted to go to this restaurant for ages. We were seated outside, in the covered, heated patio. We were far enough away from the heaters that we didn't get too hot, and far enough from the doors that we didn't get too cold. The menu has changed slightly since we dined there, but some of the things have stayed the same. We started with the sheep's milk gnudi, which is like ravioli without the pasta. I have a gluten allergy and I have missed ravioli quite a bit, so I was happy to eat this. The flavor of the sheep's milk is quite strong and unique, which I like.  For entree, I had the double-cut pork chop. This was absolutely great - the flavors and textures of the pork, butternut squash risotto, braised kale, garlic cream, and sage jus went really well together. It was an enormous portion, as well - I took some home and ate it the next day! My boyfriend had the seared rare tuna. He was less thrilled with his dish, and when I tasted it, I agreed. I normally LOVE seared tuna but this was not the best treatment of it. It tasted a little too \"fishy\" and I didn't think the other flavors complimented the tuna.  Instead of dessert, we sampled two dessert wines recommended to us by the server. I do think that $10 is a little much to charge for such a small glass of wine, but I guess that's what you have to expect when you dine at this level. We are great fans of the Big Burrito restaurants, and I think we preferred our experience at Soba to Casbah. While our food was really good, the prices were a little unreasonably high. And I wouldn't recommend the seared tuna!"}
{"text":"This place's reputation as a high-end restaurant is entirely undeserved. Every single entrée my party ordered was oversalted and bland. And for the price I was expecting much, much more. If you're looking for quality food for $25-35 per plate, go to Meat & Potatoes."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for this place -- probably because it is one of the first restaurants my fiance ever took me to, and he made a special night out of it. We've been back many times, for many occasions, and Casbah has never disappointed. Great wine, cocktails, food, service, and atmosphere. It can be a little more cramped on the inside, but it's never too loud. If you can sit outside, it feels nice and spacious. It's also very nice downstairs.  The valet parking is a huge plus in my book, especially in that area of Shadyside. The service is always prompt and never overbearing.   The last time we went, we had the sheep's milk gnudi and I'm pretty sure it was sent straight from heaven down on to our plate. I nearly fought my fiance for the last piece. He loves me so he let me have it. The swordfish was wonderful. The lamb is always great. The short rib ravioli melts in your mouth. I'd highly recommend any of those.  The dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding is worth unbuttoning your pants for...and if you like dessert wines, you'll be in heaven for sure!"}
{"text":"Consistently on point. Service from the door, to the bartenders, servers and bussers is always excellent. Sister restaurant Soba has stopped serving my favorite duck dish, so I came to Casbah for my solo birthday celebration. Long Island Duck and happy hour cocktails. Bartender Oliver was courteous, made suggestions, was happy to answer questions and engaged in talking about my upcoming trip to France. I wish I had more room in my stomach for an appetizer, the octopus has been a long standing standout, as are the olives and hummus. But the duck is always my favorite. 2 preparations on one plate with flavors that meld together oh so perfectly. Slight changes depending on seasonal ingredients, but again welcomed. Thanks for making my birthday meal special."}
{"text":"This is my favorite big burrito restaurant. The food is consistently good, and the service is as well. I often have two or three starters as my meal. They are quite interesting and well made. Their pasta dishes are quite good as well as some of the meat courses."}
{"text":"Casbah is our go-to restaurant for all special occasions.  The food is amazing, great bar, and great service, which is hard to come by anymore.  They are pricey, but worth it.  Looking forward to another dinner there this weekend!"}
{"text":"i have been going to casbah on a regular basis for the past 2 years.the reason for this is that the food is excellent and the service cant be beat. great food ,wine,and service keep me coming back.the chef at casbah always comes thru with any special requests i always have no matter how busy the kitchen is. it makes the dining a great one.thank you chef.the bartenders, and waiters/waitresses are always willing to make your casbah experience be the best it can be"}
{"text":"Excellent place for brunch.  For $22, I had a mimosa; cheese, fruit, and baguette slices; a waffle with berries and whipped cream; two pieces of bacon; and a muffin, scone, and biscuit with honey butter from the bread basket.  Service was pretty good even though the restaurant was fairly busy.  Reservations available through Open Table.  This is definitely a special occasion brunch, but it is surprisingly affordable."}
{"text":"Solid food in a so-so setting:  Location, location, location. Upon entering, you will past through a dining space, yes through a dining space to get to the hostess. This is both confusing and disruptive to other guests. This walkway leads to another door where the hostess is waiting. Inside this second room is a nice modern bar with backlit walls and upscale booths. Myself and my date however were placed in the first dining area, the indoor patio we'll call it. Others were out there too on iron tables and chairs. Perhaps the nicer area is for larger parties or events? Needless to say we were right next to the entrance so our date night was constantly offset by guests entering and exiting. Food was great and service was up to par but the main entrance was confusing and I could see this echoed by other guests as they entered."}
{"text":"Casbah was such a great experience. I dined here with my boyfriend and 2 friends for my birthday. Drinks are fairly priced. They offer wine flights and champagne flights. The food was wonderful!  I started with a homemade chicken noodle soup. Didn't expect to see it on the menu here, but it was really good. My party got the tuna tartare, and 2 different olive dishes. Seeing the prices on the menu (all $22+ for entrees) I would have expected a $5 plate of olives to be about 5-6 olives. But it was a bowl full. And they were yummy. For entrees we had the duck breast, which according to my boyfriend is the best and most perfectly cooked duck he's ever had. I had a prosciutto plate, it was technically an app, but it's my birthday and I'll eat what I want! Another member had the cioppino, and she loved it.   We then got their birthday dessert which was a chocolate cake with ganache and brûlée ice cream. It was great.   I couldn't have asked for a better birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I was only here for brunch, so that's what my review will be about! My fiancé surprised me with a surprise brunch here with family and friends for my birthday! When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by my family and friends, but I also noticed the rustic, European vibe of the covered, outdoor space. It's beautiful! During the day on the weekends, they offer a pri-fixe brunch. For $28 (I think!) you get a drink, an appetizer, and brunch main course. For my drink, I chose the seasonal mimosa, which was the pomegranate mimosa! It was so good! Just the right amount of sweet and tangy. For my appetizer, I chose the rock shrimp and calamari appetizer. It literally was so good, that I forgot to snap a picture of my food! They drizzled some kind of citrus aioli over it and it paired perfectly with the shrimp and calamari! For my entree, I chose the eggs Benedict with spinach! Again, my entree was so good and flavorful. My friend recommended Casbah for brunch, and now I am recommending it to all my fellow Yelpers! I will definitely be back for brunch, and I can't wait to try their dinner also!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with Casbah. Their Sunday brunch is an insane deal and the food is incredible. They have the best polenta ever. Also, their bloody Mary's are perfect for Sunday funday. Their lunch salad are filling and so flavorful. I either get the crab salad or the chicken salad and both are excellent.   Dinner at the bar is always fun and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem after a friend recommended I take my parents here for lunch. The restaurant is very spacious, offering both an indoor and enclosed outdoor seating area. The staff are attentive, professional, and personable me adding to the overall experience. And the food was delicious. I went for the goat cheese and spinach omelet with a side salad, beautifully and delicately made. My mom went for the salmon and shared some with me as it was cooked so well.  No dining experience would be complete without dessert. My dad and I split the creme brûlée, which had the exact right creamy texture with crisp burnt sugar along the top. Highly recommend this place for a sophisticated dining experience!"}
{"text":"I think everyone in Pittsburgh knows about this restaurant and the quality of the food and ambiance here. It's a special occasions place for sure. And somewhere to bring out of town guests, if you want to show them a fantastic and fancy meal. They lean towards the pricier side, on par with any upscale restaurant, but their lunch menu actually offers reasonably priced dishes considering. I had sandwich/salad combo and with a drink came to about $15. Not bad! especially given the quality of the food. Service is also on par with the food. They have an outdoor tented area in front. Stays cool in summer, warm in the winter. They gave me complimentary chocolate truffles at my birthday dinner, and I've seen pics of other folks complimentary bday desserts. The seafood dishes are superb, haven't had a bad dish yet (see my pics). Had scallops that were seared just right and tender in the middle. I'll go back just for that. Definitely sign up for the Big Burrito group email as they'll give discount vouchers to eat at all their restaurants. Even better!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Casbah a few times a year since it opened.  I've eaten there twice in the last two weeks and have been disappointed on both occasions.  On the first occasion, I had a leg of lamb which was underseasoned and a slightly peculiar chemical-like taste in some portions of the lamb.  On the second occasion, I had the pork chop dish.  It too was somewhat underseasoned and the meat was on the tough side.  I'll be certain to try the pasta or fish entrees on my next visit, but there's no reason why the meat shouldn't be a good choice too."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for so long as a huge Big Burrito fan.  We finally made it for Sunday brunch and happy to report it lived  up to my expectations.  We sat in the outside area (covered but with heating lamps) and had a great waiter.  They have a price fix brunch with includes a drink, app and entrée.  We decided to just order entrees and glad we did as the entrees are very large portions. I went with the mushroom and goat cheese omelet but substituted the mushrooms with tomatoes. It also came with toast ( I went with wheat), fingerling potatoes, and choice of a meat-I got the bacon. The omelet was delicious and the bacon was crisp just the way I like it.  We did have to wait a while to get salt & pepper, ketchup and jelly but finally got it all before our food got cold.   Others in my party got the eggs benedicts, shrimp omelet with egg whites and waffles. Everything got good reviews. What I also loved was we got a big pastry basket with biscuits, apple cinnamon muffins and scones.  Al very tasty and a nice starter.  I would really like to go back for happy hour as they have a very nice bar inside."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh! Very great food and even greater service. Ask for Robert, he is great! Ashley the bartender is also very nice! The food was amazing. I had the Duck it melted in my mouth. The short rib raviolis are also amazing. The muscle appetizer is a nice size for the price. You get about a pound of muscles for 12$. I will definitely be back. They make you feel special and welcomed."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner!! Be prepared to splurge a bit as this place is not cheap but definitely worth it for a nice meal. Got the song and fire without the chile and it was so good! Very sweet and much stronger than it tastes. My boyfriend got the penicillin which has more of a sour/bitter taste.  Drinks are $10-14.  You get homemade sourdough with this homemade yogurt/olive oil sauce to start your meal. Bread is a little hard around the edges but the inside is warm and airy.   For our main course i got the salmon (cooked rare) and he got the duck. They were both PHENOMENAL!!! Salmon was perfectly seared on the outside and nice and pink/raw on the inside. It came on a small bed of veggies. Looked a little small when it came out but I felt pretty full afterwards. The duck was 10/10! Perfectly cooked-- a little crispy on the edges and soft and chewy on the inside.  Main courses are $25-40.  Overall we paid $40 each."}
{"text":"It seems everytime I walk by Casbah it is simply buzzing with activity, tons of people, cars being valeted etc.  We stopped by early evening and surprisingly it was not really that busy.  It looks super fancy; however, at least with the early evening crew the dress code wasnt out of control.  We walked through the exterior seating area to get to the host, who for a second seemed like we offended her by not having a reservation ( the place was literally empty), but that was just for a second. We were quickly seated and the waitress was amazing.  She was super knowledgable about ALL the gluten free options on the menu.  Nothing is labelled, but the waiters will take you through it and the gluten free-ness is rather extensive.  We ended up getting a scallop appetizer which though small in portion was a bite of buttery soft, yet crispy goodness.  For the main course we got salmon which had a wonderful crisp (probably fried in butter ha ha) exterior with a moist center.  They even had a gluten free creme brulee with a white chocolate honey comb artistic flair on the top.  All of it was excellent.  Now I know why it is always so busy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the world.    Excellent atmosphere, fantastic food, great wine/drinks.  Menu changes up pretty regularly and I've never had a bad dish there.  The stuffed pork loin was one of my favorites.  Also they usually have a summer sangria (even in winter :) that is delicious. The scallops were also fantastic. The front patio/tent is open year round with heat lamps.  Revision:   I was just back at Casbah for a fundraising dinner.  Once a month they do a private dinner for a charity - for $100 there is a five course meal with wine flights.  All proceeds (not just the profits) go to the charity.  My dinner was so good, I literally almost cried.  The wild mushroom risotto was bar far one of the the best things I've ever eaten in my life.  Short rib ravioli was my 3rd favorite thing I ate that evening, but I found myself dreaming of it the next morning!  I had low expectations for dessert - it was a cornbread cake (weird!) but came with a blueberry compote and cream cheese ice cream.  The cornbread cake was an excellent balance between the sweetness of the ice cream and blue berries.  It was amazing!  While I don't believe these are regular menu items, I highlight this because this was their charity dinner.  That they made NO money off of.  An area where they could skim on quality - but no - it was amazing.  Reaffirmed my belief that this is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's 5 min walk from my home to Casbah and now we're finally here. The place looks really Greekish and I like the fake candle on the table :) Our waitress is really nice and friendly and seems to have a brightening personality, which is enjoyable. We ordered a bottle Project Paso and it goes perfectly well w the entree. For apps, we had sheep's milk gnudi. It is super tasty and I like the lobster and the lemon sauce together. We had the famous pork chop and the Long Island duck for entree. Both are really good. The duck has the fatty juicy leg separated from the thin nice part, which is really thoughtful and help boost the flavor. The pork is not bad either. But the texture of the meat is a little too dry for my liking. If not for the sauce and the braised kale, the dish would be disappointing. Then came out desserts: the vanilla bean creme brûlée and the chocolate de creme. Omg I can't even find a word to describe how good they are! The creme brûlée is so much better than the one I had in Joseph Temberllini. I am totally blown away by the rich taste of vanilla and eggs. The chocolate de creme is perfect, too. The texture is between ice creme and fudge, really nice and smooth. My friend said that she could have another two of this. In general, Casbah is a nice restaurant with great food and thoughtful service, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I love their brunch. Service is fantastic. The price fixed on brunch menu is nice. The smoked salmon app is too die for. The lamb and eggs and the casbah Benedict are great. My friends always get their wide selection of Omelettes and they always enjoy. Everything tastes so fresh. The ambience in their giant heated tent is so calming and their valet parking is a nice touch for the area. I already have a dinner reservation!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I feel that this is one of the most overpriced restaurants in the entire city. The food is average to good, the place is beautiful with outdoor seating, but in my opinion the price is just not worth it. They have a really good happy hour, so I would definitely recommend going to that and maybe trying an appetizer or two."}
{"text":"My fiance and I like to go to Casbah for special occasions and each time it never disappoints.    The food is great (I highly recommend the Pork Chop and the Short Rib Ravioli), the drinks are wonderful (I am a sucker for good Sangria - and Casbah's is wonderufl) and the service is outstanding (our servers are always friendly, prompt and very knowledgeable)."}
{"text":"Casbah Double-Cut Pork Chop, braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream, sage jus  This was amazing. Better than most steaks I have had. Superb."}
{"text":"Very expensive for a college student, but quite good. I would recommend this if you enjoy European food in general."}
{"text":"Creative selections and excellent flavors. Eat in the patio area if you can - nice ambience. Broad range of Prix Fixe choices that include a cocktail, an appetizer and an entree. Only disappointment was the roasted beet salad. All other selections we ordered were were excellent! Great service."}
{"text":"Celebrated my bday there tonight and it was a WONDERFUL meal. Loved our server. Cheese plate with prosciutto was good. Rose wine flight was great. And we LOVED the octopus and calimari/rock shrimp apps too. Their gnocchi was delicious. We'll definitely come back the next time we're in town! Thanks for a great dinner. :)"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go here for a while cause the menu has looked amazing every time I've checked it out, and I finally was able to last night.  We started off with the veal and pork meatballs which were awesome then I got the Long Island Duck for my meal and that was great too.  The atmosphere is really cool too, and its close-by to a lot of other places to get a drink after or shop. I'd definitely recommend for a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"Had my first dinner there last evening.  Excellent service, very attentive and pleasant.The bread came warm with sea salt butter served and another spread both were delicious.  I ordered the lamb loin and it was outstanding.  Just the right portion size, the potatoes were beyond delicious.  I don't normally have desert but I ordered a chocolate raspberry bread pudding that was also wonderful.  I could only eat half so I took the rest home.   Bar was very nice and seats comfortable and the atmosphere was casual too formal.  Nice warm environment.    I'm new to the area and have found parking a challenge, but what city doesn't have that problem, but the Casbah has valet parking - nice."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had all year. I started off with the octopus app. It was a little overdone, but the flavor was great and made up for the slight chewiness. I was excited to see a sazerac on the cocktail menu. It was good, but could use a little work. There wasn't enough anise aroma/flavor as I would have hoped. For the main course I ordered the lamb shank. This was fall off the bone delish. It didn't have the lamb flavor I would have expected. It tasted like beef, but I'm not complaining- this is one excellent dish and I highly recommend. Wine presentation was excellent and made sure to let the gentleman know his presentation was great. Toward the end of the meal I began to become slightly more disappointed disappointed. It was as if we were fed and forgotten about. After we finished our apps and entrees, it took quite a while to have our server prebus our table in preparation for desert, which also too a little longer than it should have to order. Our table got the creme brûlée and cheesecake. The brûlée was one of the best I've seen/cracked and tasted amazing... cheesecake could use a little work.   This would have been a 5 Star review if it weren't for the slower service toward the end of our experience."}
{"text":"As I'm knocking out all the Big Burrito restaurants, Casbah was one of the last on my list and I'm not sure why. Finally came here for my birthday after I received a free birthday voucher. FYI, you get a free birthday dinner (up to $30) at any of the Big Burrito restaurants if you join their mailing list.   One of my favorite things about Casbah is its outdoor seating. However, I wish we had the option to choose whether we wanted to dine inside or outside, as our reservation reserved us a seat outside in 90 degree August weather. I'm sure appropriate accommodations would have been made if we asked. Our table service was exceptional; our waitress was friendly and very knowledgable. Not to mention the food and drinks came out very quickly.   As I've seen in previous reviews, the bread is delicious! I probably could eat just the bread as my meal. We ordered the Crispy Calamari to start, my husband ordered the Short Rib Ravioli, and I, the Grilled Swordfish. The calamari was some of the best I've ever had! I loved the mild spice from the Serrano chiles paired with the sweetness from the agrodolce (which was like a honey). The hubby's ravioli was rich and comforting, but the portion was just right: not too big yet not too small. My swordfish was good, yet not quite the best swordfish dish I've ever had. The flavors were light, but I feel it was missing something, which I'm not sure what. At the end of the meal, they brought out two salted caramels which were such a nice surprise and a great way to end our meal!  I enjoyed everything about Casbah, from the service, the experience, to the food. I would definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food and drinks! Its a little pricey, but worth it if you want something better than a typical chain."}
{"text":"We went here on a double date of sorts.  My boyfriend and I and my sister and her fiance.   We started with cocktails and a cheese plate. My sister ordered the Watermelon Fizz (Gin drink) and it was super tasty.  My boyfriend ordered the Berry Bourbon, I was jealous, it was divine. I ordered the Boyd and Basil (vodka drink) and it was lovely.  5 stars for beverages done right. The cheese plate was wonderful, it came with 3 different spreads and 5 different cheese, and some prosciutto.  A+! They gave us extra bread and the salted butter and their yogurt butter.  It was amazing and we gobbled it all up. We all ordered the Arugala salad -- it was gorgeous.  (Arugula, house-made pancetta, crimini mushrooms, potatoes, Riverview Farms goat cheese, pancetta vinaigrette ) I ordered the Roasted Gerber Farms Chicken (whole grain mustard grits,greens, fresno peppers, fava & preserved lemon pesto, thyme jus), my sister got the Ricotta Cavatelli, (house-made fennel sausage, spinach,crushed tomatoes, ricotta), her fiance ordered the Grilled Swordfish(Swiss chard, roasted tomato, garlic, chilies, caper, crispy polenta, espelette, Meyer lemon vinaigrette), my boyfriend got the Long Island Duck (roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, lavender, rhubarb, duck jus)  \  My chicken was good, not great and a little flavorless. the mustard grits were superb, the lemon pesto kind of tasted like lemon pledge and really over powered the whole dish, which was really disappointing. My sister ADORES their cavatelli, but this time... it came out cold. She is not one to complain and ate it regardless. Her fiance's swordfish was perfectly prepared and tasted wonderful.  My boyfriends duck was cooked to perfection and all the sides were incredible (so he says).  When desert rolled around I was not interested as I was already so full from the dinner.  My sister ordered a glass off prosecco and Chocolate S'more Cake (toasted marshmallow, salted caramel ice cream,graham crumb) which was deadly! I tried a small bite but since I am not a sweets person it was overpoweringly chocolatey. Her fiance got the Vanilla Bean Crème Brulée (rhubarb chiboust, poached rhubarb, shortbread cookie) which he enjoyed very much. The rest of us opted for coffee's and watching them eat.  Their wine selection is dreamy, their cocktails are perfection in a glass, and their food is absolutely delectable.  I would go back to Casbah at the drop of a hat but I was not completely floored or blown away by any dish."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Casbah. Atmosphere is cool/unique, food was really delicious, and service was great.  We had the Hummus Zatar for an appetizer, and we got the duck and double-cut pork chops for entrees. Both, especially when eaten with a bit of each item on the plate in one forkful, were very, very good. I'll post some pictures. The duck was paired with gnocchi and spinach, but the sweet figs were what really made the dish special. I just might actually get the same meal the next time I go lol.  We were full after our entrees, so we didn't get any dessert. Maybe next time. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We've been to Casbah 5 different times, and they never fail to impress. Our server was attentive, and provided great suggestions for food and wine. The pork chop with parmesan risotto was excellent, and the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding was one of the best desserts we've ever had. Looking forward to our next dinner there."}
{"text":"Three strikes and you're out!  We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it.  That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day.  We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it.  We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight.  I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker.  I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah.  I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass.  When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw.  Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant.  Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?"}
{"text":"My favorite local place in Shadyside.  My husband and I go for Friday HH (5-7 pm) every time we can.  Juan is great behind the bar, but Fiona and Joe (I think Joe, maybe his name is John?) are awesome as well.  The HH drinks change seasonally but you can always get your choice liquor mixed drinks also.  For $6/drink you can't beat it!  We typically always get the hummus trio as an appetizer with extra pita bread, or the calamari.  All of the entrees we have had (pork belly, risotto, pork chop) have been perfectly prepared, zero complaints.  It's on a pricey side, so not a weekly dinner option for us (unlike the HH!)  I would say the complimentary valet is a perk, but we live within walking distance so haven't used it.    TIP:  Go to HH on Fridays, ask for Juan, get a Manhattan.  Your QOL will improve greatly!"}
{"text":"A taste of CA in PA.    We walked in and I would swear I was in Santa Monica or Hermosa  beach.  Great atmosphere- creative menu and delicious food.  The steak was to die for and the pumpkin cheesecake finished it off.    They also have a nice wine list.  The French Chardonnay was quite good!  Thanks for making me feel at home."}
{"text":"Holy moly this place is delicious. Excellent quality of all their ingredients, and every dish is meticulously prepared.   Every pasta dish I've tried is well cooked, and really rich. Heavy flavors but they match really well. They change their menu often with the seasons.   My favorite thing I've eaten is the duck, it's the moistest, most flavorful duck I've ever had.  Definitely somewhere I try to make it out to whenever I'm in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"As the reviews of Casbah appear to be particularly long-winded ... the place is nice, fancy, organic-ish, alternating menu, nice atmosphere. Good date restaurant. Good food-lovers restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food and very big portion of food...if you are hungry for real food that the place to go...food was yummy but service was little slow and awkward"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is called Casbah.  Casbah conjures up images of genies and sand dunes or something.  Nothing about this place seems remotely middle eastern to me, other than the name.  That aside, good food and great service.  Definitely a place to impress.  I especially enjoy patronizing establishments that focus on seasonable, sustainably harvested ingredients, and although Casbah is not doing the whole \"locavore\" thing, it certainly is striving for the organic and seasonal thing.  So, off the bat, that gives it big points in my book.  We started with the calamari and the squash ravioli.  Skip the ravioli - small and kind of dried out.  But the calamari was MEATY and perfectly fried.  I actually had to stop because I was feeling ill from eating too many of them.  We all had the argula salad, which was delicious.  Quite sizeable too, given the setting.  Finally, I had the scallop and crab meat... uh... pasta dish (I have no idea what kind of pasta it was... sorry).  Which was quite good.  I actually would have preferred it over linguine, I think, but whatever.  It was deelish.  Not sure why I'm not giving this place five stars.  I really enjoyed it, but it wasn't a WOW experience.  Better luck next time perhaps."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of all the Big Burrito restaurants I've tried (Eleven, Umi, Mad Mex & Casbah). I think Eleven is my favorite, but Casbah is a very close second.   My most recent trip was with my wife on 1/15/10. We started with the grilled flat bread and the butternut squash ravioli. For entrees, I had the Casbah twice cut pork chop and my wife had a pasta dish with sausage and ricotta. For dessert, I had the creme brulee and my wife had the espresso ice cream / cookie (it was really just a fancy chipwich).   The grilled flat bread came with three different dips, Humus, Red Pepper Hummus, and Baba Ganoush. I really enjoyed all three, but thought the Red Pepper Hummus stood out as the best, although if you're not a fan of garlic you may disagree. The butternut squash ravioli didn't impress me much, but my wife really liked it.   As far as the entrees, we both really enjoyed our meals. My pork chop was cooked perfectly, and was anything but dry. The sage aioli that it was topped with added an excellent flavor. The sides were kale, and butternut squash risotto, both of which really shined. I can't describe how amazing the risotto was, and the kale was extremely flavorful.   I tried my wife's pasta dish, and overall I thought it was good, but the sausage was really outstanding. Incredibly tender and flavorful.   Neither of us were too impressed with our desserts. The creme brulee was very good, but at that point, I expected it to be great. My wife's dessert sort of disappointed, since the cookies were dry.   The bill for everything listed above, plus a bottle of red wine (~$35) was $120 before tip, so it is pricey, but in my opinion totally worth it.   Also, our server was very attentive and helpful, without being intrusive. I asked his opinion on the French Malbec and he gave me his honest opinion, which was negative."}
{"text":"One year since my first venture to Casbah, I had the chance to return for a second time. And I have to say that I am officially a die-hard Casbah fan.  Yes, our dinner group quickly racked up a big bill - but it was for a birthday party, and Casbah had kindly sent along a $30 off dinner coupon beforehand. Even better, they went ahead and applied the discount even though we managed to forget to bring the actual card they had sent ahead to us. We had been completely prepared when asking about this to potentially not be able to use that $30 off at our visit, so their understanding alone would have gone a long way in making the meal a good one.  The amazing food just sealed the deal. Between a table of four we all had the chance to order and then a variety of Casbah's current menu - including their scallops, arugula salad, duck, pork and veal meatballs, and a ricotta very similar to what I had ordered the last time I visited. Everything was stupendously delicious - I honestly have no other words for how good this food was - and we all left full and satisfied with no complaints.  Casbah has definitely become a restaurant that I can come to for special events. Their food and service impressed me again tonight even more than they did last time; add in the fact that they use local ingredients whenever possible and always have something new to try with the changing seasons, and I'm completely sold. Here's to the next special occasion and dinner out at Casbah!"}
{"text":"Went for my boyfriend's birthday - he had an entree coupon (great perk!) from big burrito.  Service was outstanding, things were timed nicely between courses, and the food was amazing.  So much thought and flavor were packed into each bite!   Can be a bit pricey, but worth it for a special occasion.   Dessert is a must here - I don't like bread pudding, but here it's killer.   Sit on the patio and enjoy the delicious warm bread.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my previous experiences at Casbah, but this past weekend was a disappointment. Despite having a reservation well in advance, my husband and I were seated at a horrible table right next to the hallway that leads to the kitchen and bathrooms. There was a constant stream of distractions. Service was also really slow and my sea bass was bland. I expected better from Casbah..."}
{"text":"A party of nine gathered to celebrate my dear friend's birthday a few weeks ago during the Spring Pasta festival featuring half portions of several pasta dishes along with their normal menu.  Since our table wasn't ready when we arrived, we bellied up to the bar for some Happy Hour cocktails.  The bartender made some terrific drinks!  When our table was ready, the set up was sort of awkward with two huge round tables pushed together so the folks that were seated in the \"crease\" were sort of shorted on table space.    The service seemed slow and timed so that two thirds of our party that did not order soup/salad or from the Spring Pasta tasting menu sat without anything in front of them for more than 30 minutes.  It made us feel rushed and created a strange vibe.  The stranger thing was that we had ordered the tasting menu options (two each) as our main course.  I'm not sure why they waited so long to bring everyone else's food out.  I had to ask our waiter what was taking so long and a short time later three people whisked dishes out to our table.    Unfortunately, one friend ordered the pork chop and when he cut into it, it was totally raw. Ugh.  He declined them reheating it which I can't say that I blame him but bring him some soup and  salad on the house or a bowl of that pasta from the tasting menu. Do something extraordinary in this situation.  I know they did offer to bring him something but really, just make it right after making him sit there for 30 minutes and watch three of us eat and then serving him raw pork?  We were dropping serious change and this really tarnished the entire meal.   The food we did get was very good.  I've been a huge Casbah fan for decades so I'm hoping this was just an isolated blip.  They usually run such a tight operation."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and happy hour in the past. It's best to have reservations especially on the weekends because this place can get busy during dinner. Love the patio area but found that it was too cold for my blood during cooler weather months.  Food is great! They also have a very good wine and cocktail selection. Service is excellent and professional.  Valet is complementary with validation which is really nice because parking can be difficult especially during prime hours.  I'd come back again for special occasions and would love to try the brunch!  I've had the halibut, double pork chop, 5 cheese board with prosciutto, hummus and grilled flat bread. All very good!"}
{"text":"My absolutely favorite dish is the potato gnocchi. Just amazing! Service is fantastic, nice decor. I wish they wouldn't use such huge paper towels in the bathroom, but other than that I really like this place."}
{"text":"While in Pittsburgh for 24 hours, we went to Casbah for after dinner drinks.  This place has wonderfull covered outdoor seating, a great bar featuring unique small batch liquors and an overall cool vibe.  I had the Watermelon Gin Fizz. It was FANTASTIC! great gin, wonderful watermelon juice and ice cubes made of the aforementioned watermelon juice.  W also had a couple order of their olives which were great too.  Would definitley go back for a meal."}
{"text":"Such a pleasure to dine, on my birthday, at a restaurant with such good food and cocktails right in Shadyside. We planned in advance to come here after I received Big Burrito's free-entree birthday voucher** and after  coming here to sample dessert and drinks. The food--short rib ravioli, lamb and polenta, pumpkin cake with ice cream and toffee--was insanely rich and tasty and decadent, perfect for a celebratory meal. Our server made some clutch drink recommendations too. My favorite: the local martini, all made with locally-sourced ingredients and ridiculously good chevre-stuffed olives. Almost like a cocktail and small plate in one.  After reading everyone else's reviews, I hope to come back here next for brunch.  **to take Big Burrito up on this offer, join their mailing list decently before your birthday, and a voucher will come in the mail! It was a blissful discovery for a pair of graduate students."}
{"text":"The food was excellent--I had the roasted garlic cream appetizer and orecchiette, but between our table, we tried half of the menu with no complaints.  The port flight was unique and the wine list was good.  The bartender has a little trouble with our cocktail orders, but those were good as well.  The covered patio was perfect for a Friday evening in late August--it was pouring outside and we stayed dry.  The service was so-so, which I'm docking a star for.  The server was attentive, but she was a little slow.  She also spilled the apple icewine on two of us while bringing out deserts and we were charged for those drinks.  It gets crowded, so make a reservation.  Mad Mex is still my favorite Big Burrito restaurant, but Casbah is great for a more formal gathering or date night."}
{"text":"This had been our \"go to\" place for special celebrations. No more, I'm afraid. We have been so disappointed the last three times we've been in the past two months. Specifically, the prices have continued to increase while the portions are smaller and smaller.   Two pasta dishes: between $26 and $30. Both serviced in very shallow, small oval bowls. Half full. Seriously, there were 8 bites in the portion. It would be too small for lunch let alone dinner.   Two drinks with the pasta dishes and the bill was $100. Too much to leave empty. We raided the ice cream shop across the street."}
{"text":"So I'm a lowkey snob when it comes to going to nice restaurants and though a lot of places charge an arm and a leg, are overrated, and are just not up to par with what I'm used to coming from Sf and La. With that said, casbah was a nice little taste of home for me.  It had really fresh ingredients and a nice selection of wines to go with. We started with a cheese trio with was paired well with different preserves and chutneys.  We then had roasted octopus and the scallops.   The scallops for me were very interesting and a little too sweet for my taste with the pear and lacked texural components.  However the octopus has a real nice char, and was full of great well rounded flavors.  For our entrees, my bf got the duck which was underseasoned, and the fat was jot rendered out correctly.  The skin was also burnt.  The sides and vegetbales of the dish were seasoned and cooked beautifully though.  I had the lamb loin and it was perfectlh medium rare with delicious bitter greens.  I honestly loved every part of my entree and the red wines we selected went well with the meal.   All in all it was a delicious meal and a really nice environment.  And worth the money."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Casbah for some time and I asked myself. Why? Like, really...why?  Our monthly dinner group gathers with about 11 of us. Lots of talking and lots of wine and THE BEST SERVICE! Our server took her time with us and let's us chat it up while making sure our glasses were full and our food was timed perfectly. She did more than just reiterate what was on the menu, but gave honest opinions and helped us decide on what to order. So important because...  What. A. Menu.   Really...there's not a bad choice on the menu which makes it so difficult to select. I want it all.   This night I chose the pork chop. I should have taken half of it home, but I couldn't stop! Every bit was so delicious all the way to the lovely creme with it. I may or may not have considered dropping the bone in my purse to gnaw on later.   Looking for a nice night out, cozy atmosphere, great service and delish tastings? Get there. I for sure won't wait as long as I did in between visits!"}
{"text":"I know this might sound weird, but: My favorite thing about Casbah is the bread. The bread is *apparently* from Eleven and it's amazing. If you go for dinner you get a crusty bread that is sliced thinly and served with butter AND (more importantly) a peppery soft cheese spread. I love this combination. If you go for brunch, they give you a little assortment of bread. I've always received a lime muffin and a biscuit, and last time I went there was a chocolate scone. I can't remember the third option on the visits before, but they have always been good. It also comes with a honey butter that is delicious. One time we even asked for more butter and muffins :)   The (other) food at Casbah is also very good. I've had a tomato bisque, cauliflower soup, swordfish, different pastas, multiple desserts, and the prix fixe brunch. Everything has been great. I don't think you can go wrong with the food. And, definitely get a dessert. The desserts have all been wonderful.   The service is also great and the decor is pretty. The patio is always warm on the winter and it feels more spacious than it does inside. Casbah is one of the restaurants on my \"definitely check it out\" list."}
{"text":"Visited for brunch again on a rainy winter Sunday.  I reaffirm my previous comments.  Good service.  Generally great food (the breakfast pastries, my breakfast polenta and the wife's scallops were fantastic), however inconsistencies still prevent the 5-star praise.  While the coffee is great, the crud in the creamer and a dirty spoon to start the meal off were not.  In addition, I may have had one of the most bi-polar plates of my life...  braised lamb on grilled sourdough.  The lamb itself was kiss-yo-mama good...  seriously, this meat is a fork cutting affair.  However, the bread itself seemed stale and completely took away from the star in the spot light.  As with Eleven, you can't go wrong with the brunch pre-fix, so be prepared to need a wheel barrel to get yourself out the door!"}
{"text":"I have been here several years in a row, but not recently. I hope to visit it within a few weeks. The food was fresh, unique and delicious every time I went. Great atmosphere--outdoor dining or indoors (more fancy if I remember correctly). Absolutely wonderful service. I will write an updated review with more details once I visit it again."}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch and good dinner. The service obviously prides itself on being super proper (choreographed plate delivery, polite to the point of almost sappy attitude on the part of the waiters) and it can be a little bit annoying even. However, this is the probably the classiest of the Big Burrito restaurants, so if you're looking for that, this place is great. Extensive, yet expensive, wine menu. Small-ish portions and a very pleasant covered heated patio."}
{"text":"I love this place! The wine list is awesome and they always have a great variety of different dishes to try.    We always come here for special celebrations or a nice date night.  It's romantic and has a great atmosphere.  The wait staff is always super helpful and nice.    If you haven't been - give it a try-you won't be disappointed!  They have valet which is great because parking is sometimes tough."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to Casbah because it reminds me of the fresh, local elements I so enjoy about the Napa and Sonoma Valleys. Casbah gets a lot of produce and meats from local farms, and I love that!  I also love the cheese selections here. I usually ask my waiter to surprise me with any combination, and it's always fantastic. I am a sucker for the duck here. It's duck two ways-roasted breast and braised legs. Absolutely delicious. The gnocchi on the side is fantastic. I also like the double cut pork chop with the braised kale, as well as the roasted chicken because the polenta on the side is so yummy.  The wine list is pretty good, and the waiters are generally knowledgable about pairings, which is nice, because sometimes you just want to sit back, relax, and let someone else do the work.  You can't go wrong with any of the pastas. It's sometimes fun to split a pasta as a starter. It's a nice way to try a variety of dishes. The orrechiette is a great choice because it combines the tartness of cranberries with the savory creaminess of goat cheese. Yum!  If you're not absolutely stuffed at this point, try the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding for dessert. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Wide variety of options. Valet parking. Perfect for a romantic evening."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Casbah after checking out the menu online.  I really wanted to like Casbah once I saw the super cool dark interior of the restaurant.  Unfortunately, everything started to go down hill from there....  The waiter was less than helpful suggesting a wine to accompany our dinner, which I found to be a bit odd at such a nice restaurant.  My friend and I order split the tuna tartare and the fennel salad to start.  The tartare was decent but it lacked seasoning and I wasn't into the creme fraiche on top.  The salad was ok but nothing to rave about.  I had the short rib ravioli after reading the reviews on Yelp, but I didn't like the sauce that accompanied it.  My friend ordered the risotto with oyster mushrooms and she was also less than enthused.  Don't get me wrong, nothing about my meal was terrible, but nothing about my meal was spectacular either.   It looks like maybe I should have tried brunch.  We shall see if I'm willing to give Casbah another chance...."}
{"text":"There is a disconnect here between this name, the decor and the food. That said, I had the best pork chop I've ever had here and for that I was endlessly thankful. Good salad, delicious bread and hummus. Great service. For Pittsburgh, top notch."}
{"text":"I came here a year ago and had a really awesome meal.  I'd say the best in Pittsburgh I'd had since arriving.  Given that, we went here for a birthday dinner.  Overall, we were all left with kind of a \"meh\" experience.  Our server seemed pretty disinterested and slow.  I think the low point was someone ordered a steak medium rare (for $38).  What came out was a well done and COLD piece of meat.  It looked like a hockey puck.   When he sent it back, no apology...and no change in the bill.  I at least expected a manager or someone to come out and apologize and say \"We've taken it off the bill\" or SOMETHING.  Nope.  He sat there watching the rest of us finish our entrees before his replacement steak arrived.  The rest of the entrees were good and I would go back.  But probably with lowered expectations."}
{"text":"For a late lunch my wife and I shared the grilled flatbread, Scottish salmon, pastrami sandwich, and puréed pear and mushroom soup. Creme brûlée after. All food was really good and the soup was a very different flavor for me. Service was great. This is part of the Big Burrito restaurant group, we are definitely going to try some of the  We felt the prices were a bargain for all we got. $56"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food experience.  What else can you ask for?  Went here 2 weeks ago for the first time and totally enjoyed it.  Pretty good wine list too!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the pre-fix meal for $28- What a great deal!!! We enjoyed mimosas and bloody mary's. I had the salmon plate appetizer and the eggs benedict with prosciutto. DELICIOUS! and great service!"}
{"text":"A little pricey, but really a lovely experience. The peach gazpacho was like nothing I have ever had. The gnuti...amazing, the swordfish even better. The have an interesting and ever changing menu. Local goods are their specialty. Wine list is nice. We had a flight. One of the wines was a little off putting, they substituted quickly!"}
{"text":"The last time I was at Casbah was on a balmy spring evening in my sophomore year of college. I'd arranged a dinner with my mother in a fancy effort to spring the news on her that I wanted to move out of my college dorm the following year and into a co-ed fraternity house.  I remember being underwhelmed by the food, but that could've been the chilly reception with which I was met during this particular dinner and the conversation that entailed.   Fast forward fifteen years later (what?!) and I was back at Casbah with Jonathan D. and my future in-laws.  We enjoyed the prix-fixe brunch, and enjoy it we did!  The meal started with a small basket of mini goodies including double chocolate muffins, cranberry almond scones and buttermilk biscuits.  The meal included choice of breakfast cocktail, appetizer and entree. For my selections I chose a bloody mary, Smoked Salmon and Sea Scallop Fry.  Dare I say this meal (with one small exception) rates in my top five of all time?  I dare.  The appetizer was very filling in itself and absolutely sublime for smoked salmon.  The salmon was accompanied by a done-just-right potato pancake that I could eat ten times over.  My main entree consisted of two plump and juicy sea scallops on a bed of sweet potatoes, carmelized onions and sausage (I substituted chicken sausage for the included fennel sausage).  In addition, the entree included a portion of melt-in-your-mouth white corn grits and scrambled eggs that seemed out of place and that I completely could've done without.  A croissant was also included but I asked for fruit instead and was rewarded with a small side of grapes, canteloupe and strawberries.  My fellow brunchers feasted on a variety of Creamy Polenta (looked amazing), a cheese tasting, Lamb and Eggs, and Casbah Benedict. Everyone left smiling and satisfied.  So, if you haven't given Casbah a try in the last decade, it might be time to visit again.  I'm so very glad I did!  P.S. Bring your coat into the restroom. It was about 10 below in there. Brrr!"}
{"text":"We went to Casbah this past Saturday.   It is my birthday month and Big Burrito offers a great deal for anyone who is on their mailing list, providing their patrons with a free entrée up to $30.00 at any of their locations beside Umi.  I chose Casbah since I have been to all of them but this one.  Our reservations were early at 5pm on a Sunday.  We arrived seated quickly in their outside seating area, which is very nice.  We were brought some water while we reviewed the menu.  I decided to start with a Manhattan to drink.  It was very nice, and strong.  Next we decided to order.  Earlier I looked online at their menu and I decided I would be ordering either the Cioppino, littleneck clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, halibut, grilled sourdough -32 or their Long Island Duck, roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, lavender, peaches, duck jus- 29.  I have had the duck dish at Soba before and loved it, but I wanted to try the Cioppino despite that, since I also love seafood and shellfish.  This I would discover was a mistake.  My partner got the Pork Chop dinner.  We placed our orders and waited.  During our wait they brought some bread.  It was a nice touch; the bread was warm and served with two types of spreads.  By the time our entrées came I wanted another drink and asked for Boyd and Basil - 10 Boyd & Blair vodka, fresh lemon, basil, soda, Angostura bitters, this was one of their signature cocktails.  So we began to eat.  The scallops in the dish were excellent.  Perfect sear and seasoned, as well as the shrimp.  The tiny piece of halibut in the dish and I mean tiny, was so overcooked.  I choked it down but completely unappealing and tiny.  The sauce in this fish soup was also not that great.  The dish came with bread to soak up the juices but the bread itself was burnt and hard.  It actually hurt my mouth to bite it and that was after dipping it in the juices.  I was going to ask for more bread, hold the burn, but our server had not come back.  So I finished the meal and said forget it.    At this point the drink I ordered was still not delivered.  I was done eating and had to use the restroom so I told my husband if he came back without my drink to tell him forget it and just bring the check.  When I got back to the table that was indeed what happened.  Except he told him he was sorry and if we ordered dessert he would comp my drink.  So when he finally returned, he ordered the Chocolate Cheese Cake Bombe, Pinotage syrup & whipped cream, hazelnuts, praline ice cream, gastrique, when the waiter asked me I simply said no thank you, can I just have the drink I ordered?  He brought dessert and my drink and explained it was \"on the house, and it was their/his fault.\"  No biggy really, I was way more annoyed with my meal.  I think what really bothered me was one, how small the entrée was.  It was more suited to be a lunch portion in my opinion.  And then how much it was, but I did have the coupon so I guess I can't complain that much about that.  Simply put if I had spent $32.00 on the meal I got I would have been very upset.  Lastly, the halibut was so overcooked and dry, same with the toast, and the sauce wasn't that pleasant.  All in all I wish I would have gone with the duck.  Live and learn."}
{"text":"The hubby and I got here super early so we went to the bar and had wine, the Boyd and basil, and blood and sand. All very very good. We then got sat at a table outside. They have an amazing outdoor patio that's covered and heated in the winter, you wouldn't even know the difference! Except I'm always cold as is and we were originally sat NOT under heat vents. We DID ask for a different table, basically because im A baby and couldn't handle it, it wasn't THAT cold, but cooler than I could handle. The charred octopus was good to start, our server Rebecca was amazing! Very sweet and professional, def knew her stuff. For entrees we had the filet mignon and pork chop. The filet was on point, my only complaint was that they didn't take temps on the pork. We would've loved it medium but they cook it med well or so, which of course, is going to make it a little dry and tough. Dessert was great and we had olives and a cheese plate to go, overall s great evening!"}
{"text":"This place isn't in my price range but on special occasions the food is actually worth the extra money. I didn't know food could taste so good. :-)"}
{"text":"Part of the same restaurant group as Eleven, which I have eaten at and reviewed here, Casbah is a vibrant restaurant in Pittsburgh's Shadyside district.  While the menu changes daily, there are several mainstays available on most evenings.  One of them, the pork chop, is one of the finest I have ever had.  Double cut, juicy and flavorful, it is an absolute winner.  Braised kale and butternut squash risotto accompany this perfect dish.  I managed to sample two other dishes (courtesy of my willing dinner mates) that are also noteworthy.  The short rib ravioli is an excellent combination of tender, richly flavored beef rib and toothy pasta.  The ricotta cavatelli combines fresh, simple ingredients into a well structured dish.  Service was a little hit or miss the evening I was there.  Part of that may be because we were a large group and the restaurant was rather busy.  However, for an establishment of this caliber, I do expect more.  Nevertheless, I plan on trying Casbah again on my next trip to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Coworkers and I had a lovely lunch at the Casbah. Squash Soup and salad were all very good. The omelette was also very good. Orecchiette with chicken and goat cheese was fabulous. Service was not overly friendly, but efficient. The restaurant has a calming decor inside and the covered patio is bright and spacious. Complimentary Valet is a plus."}
{"text":"This is a well run restaurant with great food, great consistency and excellent service.  We were sitting on the patio and the angle of the sun changed to shine right in our eyes, but the waiter was able to quickly move us to a better table.  I highly recommend the cheese plate, it is probably the best in Pittsburgh.  The Arugula Salad is delicious.  So is the Alaskan Halibut.  You really can't go wrong with Casbah."}
{"text":"Glad to see that the Big Burrito restaurants are alive and well in Pittsburgh, and dinner tonight was my first time in awhile at one of their establishments.  Bit of a complex review.  My biggest gripe with Casbah is that it's Casbah Mediterranean when the menu (at least on this night, but I don't think it changes all that much) offers very authentic Mediterranean dishes.  One lamb dish (not overly Mediterranean) and no couscous or tagine, which are major staples of Mediterranean cuisine.  Even a side of hummus and pita or veggies would be nice.  Nonetheless, the menu has lots of fine options, just none that I've seen in a typical Mediterranean joint.  I think it's a little misleading especially if you're seeking Mediterranean cuisine.  We sampled several of the cocktails, all of which were creative and well priced.  As for food, we split the bruschetta (prosciutto and blue cheese), meatballs (pork) and the brussel sprouts were quite tasty, beet salad, and the potato gnocchi. So lots of food!  All was freshly prepared with quality ingredients and served with sophisticated presentation.  Lots of fine restaurants opening in the area, but it's clear to see that they have a loyal following."}
{"text":"I don't understand the high rankings of this place and why it consistently gets into Pittsburgh's top 3. The food is rather mediocre for the price. I went there twice, both times paying close to $300 for dinner for 3, but the food really didn't stand up to expectations. Sea scallops that I have ordered last time were burned outside and rubbery and chewy inside. Risotto from my previous try was falling apart. But the most annoying thing is that there is way, way too much food on the plate for fine dining place. The appetizer cheese platter that we ordered last time had enough cheese to last for a week! I don't go to places like that to stuff myself... So no, I do not like it overall. Maybe it is one of those \"good enough for Pittsburgh\" kind of restaurants, but then maybe they should think about charging a bit less. Unless they charge for quantity, not quality...  Service is okay."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  I came here with my family and we didn't have reservations so we had our choice of either the downstairs (didn't know they *had* a downstairs!) or the outside patio.  We chose the patio with the great heating lamps and stayed comfortably warm throughout the meal.  Service was excellent!  Our server was very attentive and very pleasant.  I can't remember her name though! :(     We selected their prix fixe brunch for $22.  I chose the bellini which was good and my family chose the mimosas.  For the appetizer, my family chose the arugula salad (excellent - the goat cheese is great) and I had the creamy polenta (surprisingly delicious).  For the entree, I selected the soft shell crab which was new on the menu.  Excellent!  The egg was a bit strange of a combo to me.  My family selected the crab and lobster omelette (good but they wouldn't get it again) and the petit filet (med well was too tough - steak was okay but not overwhelmingly exciting)"}
{"text":"Great menu - lots of choices. There were six of us and we shared 3 appetizers - the grilled chickpea hummus, the grilled octopus, and the mixed olives. The babagonoush hummus was delicious I had a winter fizz drink which was prosecco  with cranberry and mint nice flavor and perfect before dinner drink I had the cioppiano which was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. The sour dough bread was soooooo good. Most everyone else ordered pasta dishes and thought them very good. We opted not to have dessert there but they did bring salted Carmels to the table with the check so if they were any prediction of the desserts they are EXCELLENT. Great place to dine - I will return. And the complimentary valet parking was nice as well - didn't have to search for a place to park and the valet were super nice. I should mention our waitress was also super nice and very accomodating to our larger party."}
{"text":"I signed up for my big burrito birthday coupon and knew Casbah was the place I wanted to go to use it! Being that it is a little out of my price range normally, I figured it was the best place to use my coupon and celebrate my birthday! Believe it or not, this was the 2nd Big Burrito restaurant that I have ever been to, Kaya being my first (and I only visited the Sunday prior to coming here on Friday).   My boyfriend and I made reservations for 6:30 pm on a Friday. We only made them the night before and it wasn't a problem at all. When you arrive, there is complimentary valet parking- how awesome is that? We were sat on the covered patio area, which I really loved. It was a little slanted, which was weird, but our table wasn't thankfully. It was really beautiful- plants and art all around. We started off with drinks- I ordered the white wine flight. Having had a wine flight one other time, I found these to be pretty reasonably priced. I received three small glasses of white wine for $11. Each one was delicious and I really loved how they were all from different places (Austria, Italy and Spain).   Next, we received bread and two types of butter. One was more traditional and the other was a homemade lemon and herb butter. I really liked them both! For my entrée, I ordered the pork chop. It came with a magical mix of sauces and two side dishes- one that was mainly potatoes and the other being sautéed kale. WOW. The garlic cream sauce was unbelievable, the pork chop was HUGE and literally cooked to perfection. The kale was perfect, not bitter at ALL (how do they do that?)- it was amazing. The portion was huge and I somehow engulfed the entire thing. My boyfriend ordered the short rib ravioli's and loved it- although he preferred my meal over his. I was so full that I skipped the desert. They noticed my birthday coupon and presented me with an adorable little plate with \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate and two salted caramels- what an adorable touch!   Service was perfect, the wine was perfect, the food was perfect... now I see what the fuss is all about. This might be one of my new \"special occasion\" spots-  and we are planning to come back next month for my boyfriend's birthday (I need that pork chop in my life again, stat!)."}
{"text":"Brunch = best in the burgh.  Hands down.  Best. eggs. ever. I am not even sure how the eggs can be that good.  I know what you are saying, \"They are eggs, Jessica.  Get a grip.\"  No.  I will not.  I cannot.  I want to stand on top of rooftops and shout my love for these eggs all over town.    J, H and I went there a few Sundays ago.  We all got the same thing. When was the last time you went to a meal and all three people ordered the same thing.  It was that good.  The scallop breakfast is out of this world.  2 perfectly cooked scallops, scrambled eggs (the eggs!!!), the creamiest, tastiest grits in the world, buttery croissant and sausage, apples and butternut squash.  Don't think those things go together?  They do and are awesome!  J and I also both got orders of bacon cause no brunch is complete without bacon.    Our service was also great.  Nice hostess, awesome waiter.  All was perfect.    Really freaking good brunch.  Really.  Cannot say enough about those freaking eggs.    Oh, but don't order an additional mimosa from the deal - they are $8 a piece which is a bit steep."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group (11) for a friend's birthday on a Friday night and the staff was super nice and accommodating. Definitely make a reservation if you can though. The food was amazing and came in a reasonable amount of time given our group size. I had the salmon entree with a grown-up (non-alcoholic) soda and they were both great. Definitely recommend signing up for the Big Burrito birthday reward and coming here for special occasions!"}
{"text":"My introduction as a youth (dating back AWAYS) to gourmet and class.  15 years later, still delivers the goods.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I have heard much about Casbah being one of the best eateries in the 412. I went on their pasta special and got the ricotta ravioli and the short rib ravioli. The ricotta was the second most expensive dish on that menu and we received two saggy, bland pouches of what tasted like a microwaved lunchable. The short rib was doused in a gravy-like sauce that overwhelmed any taste or subtleties that may have existed. Heavy and bland. Not generally what I go out to eat for.   The service was also extremely slow. 20 minutes to get our bread and 50 to get our appetizers."}
{"text":"It was funny because my boyfriend and I came here spontaneously -- we were going to stop by a pizza place for a slice, but decided to stop into Casbah instead. Totally different atmosphere and dining experience. It's a pretty romantic setup. When we went (around 8pm on a Thursday), there weren't too many people there.  I felt like the service was good. They didn't treat us like second rate citizens even though we were in casual clothes and I was carrying my backpack (typical student outfit).  We had the tuna tartare, which was lovely. Then, we tried the duck with gnocchi and spinach which was also delicious and a great blend of flavors. For dessert, we had the Chocolate Cheese Cake Bombe, which was just ok. It looked pretty, but the flavors weren't anything special. Oh, they also had really nice house made bread that came to our table warm, crusty and crunchy outside and soft inside.  Overall, Casbah was a good experience, but I'm not drooling as I think back to the meal. I'm not sure I'll go back because there are other places to try and the price point makes it somewhere I wouldn't just go to on a normal day."}
{"text":"Upon receipt of the much-coveted Big Burrito birthday voucher, I had to make the tough decision about which of their restaurants to visit.  I was torn between Casbah and Eleven, but upon perusing the menus, reading reviews, and giving the matter much thought, I settled on Casbah.  I knew I'd made a good decision when I invited some friends to join me, and they said that, based on their past experience, I'd made an excellent choice!  Our meal started off with a few slices of bread, which came with butter and a Greek yogurt spread.  The butter was good, but the yogurt spread was amazing, and both of them dressed up the bread very well.  We then ordered an appetizer of the bruschetta, which was not your normal bruschetta, but was delicious.  I'm not entirely sure of the ingredients, since what we received doesn't match the menu description posted on the website, but one notable thing about it was that it had some pomegranate seeds that gave it a subtle sweetness and juiciness, complementing the other savory ingredients.  For my entree, I ordered the orecchiette, a dish consisting of ear-shaped pasta tossed in a goat cheese and sage cream sauce, with chicken and dried cranberries.  Flavorwise, this was one of the most well-balanced dishes I've ever eaten, with the savory ingredients and sweet hints from the cranberries (which were actual cranberries, rather than craisins, as I'd imagined) melding together in perfect culinary harmony.  The pasta was also cooked to a perfect al dente firmness, which held up well in the microwave several days later when I ate the leftovers.  The cranberry-lime dry soda that I ordered to go with this entree complemented it very nicely, and was a great alternative to wine (while I was tempted, I didn't order any since my dining companions decided not to, due to having driven).  My two dining companions ordered the Scottish salmon and the gnocchi, respectively.  Based on the samples that they provided me, Casbah did a great job on these dishes, as well!  The salmon had a subtle saltiness that complemented the flavor nicely, without overpowering it.  My friend who ordered it had had it before at Casbah, but had since been to Scotland, and he said that it was very similar in quality and taste to the versions of this dish that he'd tried there.  The gnocchi was one of the most unique and varied dishes I've encountered, and, based on the two bites that I tried, brought the ingredients together in a medley of flavors and textures.  I think my friend who ordered it described it best by saying that every bite was a bit different, but that they were all delicious!  Although all of us tried bites of each other's dishes, we each liked our own choice best, so we chose well.  After our entrees, we decided to order dessert.  Although I was tempted by the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, since many reviewers speak highly of it, I decided to follow my instinct and get the chocolate-hazelnut bomba.  I'm so glad that I did, since this dessert was amazing!  If you like dark chocolatey, torte-like desserts or Nutella, this dessert is a must-try. Since I mentioned I was at Casbah for a birthday dinner, the dessert was served with \"Happy birthday\" written on the plate in chocolate icing, which was a nice touch.  My dining partners ordered the creme brulee to split between themselves, which came topped with an apple compote.  Based on the bite that I tried, it was a good rendition of a brulee, but couldn't match the star power of the chocolate bomba.  We visited at 7:30pm last Sun., at the later end of their serving hours, but service from our waiter, Brian, was very good.  We were seated in the tent-like area in the front of the restaurant, which stayed surprisingly warm during most of our visit.  At one point before dessert, upon returning from the restroom, I noticed that it'd cooled off, but the manager came out to turn on the heating elements, and it warmed back up in less than 10 min.  In sum, if you're looking for a solid fine dining experience with innovative, delicious food, Casbah is a great choice.  The food was impressive in its quality, and the service was what I've come to expect at a higher-end restaurant.  I'd particularly recommend getting on the Big Burrito mailing list to receive a $30 birthday voucher and $10 off coupons for the holidays, and taking advantage of one of these occasions to try it.  I'm certain that you'll be as pleased with your experience there as me and my dining partners!"}
{"text":"Casbah (and Eleven, and others in the chain) is a typical American high-end restaurant: average food, high prices, expensive drinks. The focus is on profit maximization of the Restaurant Makeover variety, not on a passion for food. So the food is so-so, but expensive. Portions are large, though, so you feel you've gotten value for money. I dare say they rarely deliver a bad experience as the emphasis is on repeatability (but I've only been here the once). Service was good.   There are much more amazing - and cheaper - places to try in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Came here for their pasta night. Let's dive into their genius marketing team.. they don't participate in restaurant week but feature their pasta night the same week as it, and their prices end up being right around $35 or more. Enough about business and more about their SERIOUSLY YUMMY FOOD! All of the pastas were delicious, flavorful, and savory. Highly recommend going here- for pasta night or not. Their regular menu is also out of this world. Love the wine/bubbly flights. For apps, we got a beet salad and octopus. Holy moly, I start drooling just thinking about it. Great ambiance, even better food."}
{"text":"We came back for the Nouveau Beaujolais Dinner they had celebrating the release of France's famous quick fermented red table wine. There were 4 courses to the dinner and they were all exceptional. The chestnut risotto was so delicious I wanted to lick my plate and this wasn't even something I would have looked at twice if I was ordering from the regular menu. The other courses included duck breast, Chilean sea bass and dessert course. Each had a version of the Nouveau Beaujolais wine reduction.  We brought friends who had never been here and they loved it. One of them is French and the other lived there for several years so it was fun to do this special dinner Casbah created. Also great marketing tool for them, bravo Casbah!  Again, we had Alexis as our waitress. It was much busier this time and she was still attentive and helpful even when there was a snafu with hubby's GF request for dessert."}
{"text":"Not sure what really needs to be added about this restaurant; it is very very good (my favorite in Pittsburgh) but by far not inexpensive. The best thing you can do, and I am not sure if it has been touched on in previous reviews, is join the Big Burrito group mailing list; you will receive a free coupon for an entrée around your birthday to be used within a certain time period...makes it a really good deal. Oh, their wine menu is ridiculously overpriced...call up to find out their current corking fee (I think around $15 bucks) and bring a better bottle at a better price than you are willing to spend there."}
{"text":"great atmosphere and great food. while the menu changes seasonally, my group all enjoyed the food - crab/scallop pasta, pumpkin risotto and rare tuna.  casbah also has a great wine list, and great service that is there when you need them, but doesn't annoy."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dining experience at Casbah.  The cheese plate was extremely large and really good.  There was a nice balance of cheese to eat.  My date and I both ordered pasta dishes.  When a restaurant makes their own pasta from scratch, how do you order anything else?  The non-pasta dishes that went past our table looked great, but I think we made the right decisions.  My date had a pasta with scallops and crab.  It was amazing.  I had a pasta with kale and sausage.  It was equally amazing.  I felt Casbah was heavy on their sauce.  Casbah has a large wine selection, but I felt the stand out option was the port wine flight for desert."}
{"text":"We love this Big Burrito establishment as it matures and becomes a perennial choice to enjoy, no matter the season. It starts with a well-stocked bar area, nicely lit and very comfortable. The indoor dining area is complimented by the (now-covered) outdoor seating area.  Service was mostly attentive, and very friendly throughout the evening. The wine list is varied and reasonably prices, with especially fine after dinner selections.  We started with two appetizers this time out, the Tuna Tartare and the Sheep's Milk Gnudi. The tuna was very clean, served with nicely grilled sourdough. The Gnudi had a great truffle butter and tarragon flavored sauce.  I also had my all-time favorite salad, the Arugula. This masterpiece features homemade pancetta, crimini mushrooms, and goat cheese. We split the Ricotta Cavatelli Pasta, prepared thoughtfully with fennel sausage and spinach.  Dessert was a nice assortment of house prepared sorbets (mixed berry/pineapple/grapefruit).  Valet parking is complimentary; please tip your driver!"}
{"text":"We went here for a wedding rehearsal dinner last night and the experience was amazing. They set us in a private room in the basement which was very dimly lit and each table had its own server.   We were served a four course meal with a very interesting salad, flatbread with different types of hummus. Our main course was the filet mignon with a delicious creamy potatoes surrounding it.  The dress attire for this place is sort of dressy which is great.  There is valet parking which is a huge plus because it's located in a very busy area right on a main street. I would love to come back again with just my wife and try other things on the menu. We will try to go back."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Casbah is the best of the big burrito restaurants. I have been to Casbah for dinner and drinks a few times. During my latest experience, I was impressed by the hearty fall entrees. I decided to take my husband to Casbah for his birthday on friday night. I called on Monday and luckily, I was able get a reservation without a problem. When we arrived, the restaurant was packed but we did not have to wait. We were sat in the beautiful front covered patio area.   We decided to start our meal with the veal and pork meatballs. This was my favorite part of the meal. I could have ordered 3 of these for my entree! The polenta and the crispy brussel sprouts added a smoothness and a salty crunch. Delish. You have to try these! For my entree, I ordered the double cut pork chop and my husband ordered the cioppino. The huge pork chop arrived medium well, as requested, but was still tender and juicy, even better when dipped in the sage jus. In additiion, the bitterness of the braised kale paired well with the smooth, creamy parmesan and proscutto risotto. My husband was also a big fan of the cioppino. The mussels, clams, shrimp, halibut and scallops were cooked to perfection. I was equally impressed with the size of the scallops. We're talking the width of a coffee cup! Unfortunately, we were too full for dessert but were presented with housemade salted carmels to end our meal.   If you are looking for a place to enjoy good wine, amazing food and a pleasant atmosphere, Casbah is for you."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I have to admit the price is a bit high, but it's just worth it. Beware though during dinner times, everyone there dresses up pretty formally. I am not talking about suits and ties, but you know what I mean so make sure you dress up appropriately!"}
{"text":"Casbah is one of our favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. The food and service are always impeccable. Though pricey, I think it is worth every penny. Dinner entrees are always amazing, brunch is fantastic, and lunch is also great- the Piccolo gusto menu allows you to try mini portions of 3 things (salad, pasta, half sandwich) without falling asleep when you get back to work, for 15 bucks. The service can be slower during weekday lunch and sometimes the fish entrees are a little less than spectacular (likely a result of product limitations in Pittsburgh), but those are the only less-than-stellar feedback points I can give.   Also, with a new baby in our family, I really appreciate that despite being a classy and delicious restaurant, Casbah is pretty kid friendly. The tables on the covered patio accommodate a stroller really well.  Lastly, Casbah has several prix fixe themed dinners throughout the year. We went recently when they were doing a Greek theme, it was outstanding and I couldn't believe how good of a value it was, with or without the wine pairings.   All reasons why we will keep going to Casbah regularly!"}
{"text":"Casbah has been one of our favorite restaurants for a long time. Last night it was extremely busy, probably because the steelers, pens, and pit all have home games this weekend. We were happy to get the quietest table in the house, next to the wine room in the basement. We each ordered the duck entre, which was outstanding. Like almost all of the other reviewers, we agree that the bread alone will bring us back. Cocktails, wine, and service were also first class. For full disclosure, this glowing review is from a local bumpkin (who happened to travel and dine extensively in all U.S. States, Canadian provinces, and most European countries), not a sophisticated, urbane LA resident, shocked by Pittsburgh's high restaurant prices. Take it for what it's worth!"}
{"text":"A parking spot right in front of Casbah opened up and my boyfriend and I decided to snag the spot and make an impromptu date out of it! In the past, the parking situation has always been a deterrent to dining here although I've learned that they have valet. This place does get quite full even on a weeknight so reservations are recommended if you absolutely want a table although I liked sitting at the bar. The Casbah crowd is definitely a bit upscale and we felt a tad underdressed, in all our impromptu glory, in sneakers and jeans. However the cocktail menu quickly distracted us from that and soon enough I was enjoying sipping my Casbah kombucha. Vegetarian options are limited but the few options they have are excellent so I'm ok with that. I loved the red pepper muhamarra dip and the burrata and definitely recommend both. The bread they serve is lovely, warm and fresh. Now my boyfriend and I are both vegetarians and we didn't notice that the burrata comes with prosciutto and when it came to us, we were like uhoh..what do we do now! Our bartender noticed our expressions and came upto us, inquiring if the prosciutto was the issue. Within minutes he had a replacement brought to us without the prosciutto! We didn't even have to ask! Talk about attentive service! Casbah charges a pretty price for their offerings but is worth every bit of it. The food, ambience and service is top notch. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I had heard from friends that Casbah was one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh, and my experience definitely lived up to the hype.  I don't know how a place owned by a company called Big Burrito Group churns out such outstanding Mediterranean fare, but I was impressed.  Everything was done right--the ambiance was sophisticated yet unpretentious, service was professional, and the wine list was impressive, especially the by-the-glass options, which were necessary since I was dining solo.  The food (I started with grilled Spanish octopus and then had the halibut) was all fresh and prepared to perfection, with inventive flavoring that complimented rather than overwhelmed the dishes themselves.  I'm not in Pittsburgh often--too bad, it is a beautiful city--but I would visit Casbah again without hesitation."}
{"text":"Of the Big Burrito group restaurants Casbah is the one that has never failed us.  Consistent and delicious with great flavors of the mediterrean.    All of the dishes are served with great flavors from their pastas to their duck but their signature Arugula salad is a reason in and of itself to visit.  Crisp clean flavors with complex combinations of textures.  Special occasions or hungry on a week night... casbah is a great stop"}
{"text":"Just got back (after looking for a taxi in this 3rd world city - but that's for another review) We liked the atmo.  Liked eating \"under the outdoor extension\" under the well working heaters- it is fun and really makes it feel like a more unique dining experience.  OK now on to the food. We started with a Spanish grilled octopus - it was delicious - charred grilled taste, delightful blood orange accompaniment - perfect.  Then had we not had the Habitat beet salad yesterday (it was amazing - check my review) - this would be the best, B U T it was still very good and had Maytag blue cheese, pistachios and nice beets - OK not amazing, but nice beets. Then we had another unfortunate comparison to Habitat.  When we had the pork chop - generous portion but a bit fatty. (Again Habitat's was so much better)  We also had the new pasta dish on the menu which was ok - big scallops (4) but a less than impressive sauce.  Glad we went here - it was different, but not really special and the nightmare of getting a taxi back was just -- well a nightmare (what is wrong with Pittsburgh taxi service -- everything)  City fathers (and Mothers) -- fix this!!!!!"}
{"text":"Casbah is one of my favorite spots for an after-work drink or a romantic meal. The lighting and decor are very calming and inviting. The menu is refined Mediterranean with some modern twists. The waitstaff is attentive, timely, and always takes care of my food allergies. I always order sea bass or some sort of fish here, because they sear it to perfection. The chef actually made up their own side for my dish because I was allergic to the one on the menu. I received delicious crispy potatoes and sauteed arugula. Fantastic touch! They have a great wine list, as well. I would recommend Casbah to pretty much anyone, but it is especially nice for a one-on-one meal or a drink at the bar."}
{"text":"Great place for so many occasions. My husband took me on our first date here for a very intimate night out (I definitely was impressed).  He took me back for a surprise birthday party in their downstairs area. The food is always out of this world. I have said to my self on multiple occasions (while reading the menu) \"i'm not sure what some of these ingredients are but Casbah never disappoints\" and they never have!! I can't wait to live in Pittsburgh again, this is my first stop."}
{"text":"Parking: Street parking or valet.   Initial thoughts: I've heard this place had great food, and since I was quite hungry, I was excited.   Wait time: We had a reservation, so we were seated right away.   Service: Great - the waiters were attentive and made sure we were enjoying our meal and had our water glasses filled.   Appetizers/Small dishes: Cheese tasting with 5 cheese - it was so tiny. Not worth the price. The cheese were interesting, but for the cost I expected more than just a few small slices of bread, a few slices of cheese, and a dollop of jam.   Main dish: Long Island duck - TOO SALTY. I thought the duck itself was cooked well, but as I was eating it I had to constantly drink water to make up for the taste. There were a few measly pieces of gnocchi. There was no lavender flavor or kumquats. I would recommend getting something other than this dish if you do go.   Drinks: We ordered a bottle of Riesling, which was good but nothing special.   Cost: The main dishes were all around $30-35. For the cost, I expected the flavor to wow me, but really I just need a lot of water to drink.   Ambience: We sat in the part of the restaurant that was under a tent-like structure. It was a bit chilly, but they had the heated lights on. It is dark, so don't expect to take any good photos.   Overall: Just okay. I wish I could give it more stars, but really it was disappointing. After that unsettling duck main dish, I'm not sure If I'm willing to try this place again."}
{"text":"Casbah is great! They always over deliver; whether it be the service, the food presentation or the quality, freshness and uniqueness of each dish starting with the appetizer all the way to dessert they never disappoint. Their menu is constantly changing so you never know what you'll get each time you go.  I also love the atmosphere & eating outside on their patio.  Casbah is a must try (and ask to eat on the patio)!"}
{"text":"What a great place - nice service, solid food... Will be back for sure. Appreciated that they have fundraising dinners too."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and both times it's been amazing.   Time 1 (girlfriend's birthday) : we got the flatbread and the chickpea hummus and red pepper Muhummra to share and i got the calamari appetizer.  The latter was very solid but the made in-house flatbreads and the hummus and muhummra (positive i'm misspelling that) were amazing. She got the duck for her main course and i the Double Cut pork Chop.  Both were amazing but her Duck really stole the show.  We then got a desert (by surprise for her) of the flourless chocolate cake, which we both all but melted over.   Second time, returned this past weekend with the Girlfriend and her parents. The flatbreads and same hummus and muhummra combo drove rave reviews again, as did the butternut squash puree.  It was the Half Chicken my girlfriend and i each had, as well as the meatballs and brussels sprouts dish her dad got and the lamb her mom got, that were the stars though.  The chicken fell off the bone and tasted amazing, essentially cooked to perfection.  I'd go back again just for the chicken.  Casbah has become a fast favorite in this city, in particular for when company is in town or i feel like treating myself a little, and i have a feeling it will remain in that category for a long time."}
{"text":"Casbah is the type of restaurant that I find most difficult to write about.  I came here recently with my beau for a special birthday dinner, seeing as they had several vegetarian options on their menu. We booked our reservation on OpenTable, which I was glad to see that they actually used. I noted that both of us diners were vegetarian and found that our server and hostess were very accommodating in that respect.  We were seated outside, which offered us a pleasant experience on their lovely patio. Their ambiance is nice and their service outstanding. I found that everyone there knew what they were talking about and possessed a deep passion for food, as opposed to obnoxious pretense which upscale restaurants like Casbah can have.  As for the food, it was above average. Nothing outstanding, but definitely still tasty. My boyfriend ordered the gnocchi (made veg), which turned out to be excellent, while I got the cavatelli (also made veg). We also shared a half-order of the torchetti and unfortunately, neither the cavatelli nor the torchetti stood out too much. The gnocchi and the appetizer (grilled chickpea flatbread) were by far the highlights.  In the end, come here for the service and ambiance, but don't expect to have the meal of your lifetime."}
{"text":"I went to Casbah for my birthday and it was so delicious! I mean, Mediterranean food is my favorite... But then you go and add a wine bar??? You really can't go wrong.   The bread with the butter and yogurt based sauce they offered from Eleven was really good - flavor wise and for holding you over until the main event/entrees :p  I had the duck entree which was just a little too overcooked for me. My boyfriend experienced the opposite and had the halibut which was a little too undercooked. The flavors were all there though!   We had a Pinot noir and a Chardonnay and both were great (esp the Chardonnay)  I am excited to come back in the future!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Casbah for over a decade (pretty much since it first opened).  I very much like the place, and it has maintained its general character even as the head chefs have changed over the years.  Casbah is very good about continually updating its menu in an effort to stay current and relevant.  Over the years I have enjoyed many wonderful meals here including a fantastic orrechete (sp?) pasta with chicken and cranberries in a lovely cream sauce, and some of the best pork  chops (double cut)  I have ever encountered (although I no longer eat mammals, so they are likely to be the best pork chops I will ever eat).    This is not an inexpensive place, it can be quite pricey for dinner.  One plus is that they have a very reasonable brunch on Sundays.  Their arugula salad during brunch with small diced potatoes and pancetta is fantastic.  My one complaint about the salad is that it needs a bit of acid. I always ask for a small slice of orange and then squeeze the juice onto the salad.  This cuts through the fat from the pancetta and makes the salad even more tasty.  Others may disagree, but even though this is a fairly fancy place, it is suitable for children.  Casbah has a semi outdoor seating area that is enclosed and heated even in winter.  My wife and I have often dined here with our kids.  This semi outdoor area is a bit more casual and absorbs the sounds of loud children fairly well.  You can bring kids without suffering the disdain of any but the most obnoxious of fellow diners."}
{"text":"Casbah is great for a special occasion or if you feel like splurging. The atmosphere is very nice and the food is fantastic. The beer selection is above average."}
{"text":"After a long day of recruiting at CMU, I arranged a dinner for 16 people here in Casbah... Prefix menu, over all the experience was ok.  Break down: Scallops - Appetizer - I had high expectation but it came out a bit too over spiced.  Very rich i am glad they only gave me two.   Fillet Mignon - Entree - Very tender piece of meat but no wear near as good as some of the places here in the Silicon Valley or even some of the chain steak places like Morton's. Dessert - The highlight of the of the meal.  Mango panna cotta with some sorbet.  It was amazing.  The consistency of the panna cotta was perfect.  It wasn't too dense or too liquidy.  Being a Big Burrito restaurant, I expected more but it was good nonetheless."}
{"text":"I love the Casbah! I agree that perhaps they should add some specials from time to time to the menu; however, the food is consistently good. Unlike other pretentious restaurants, they don't pretend to be what they aren't. The wait staff is professional, especially Seth and Joseph and the bartenders, Oliver and Fiona are always eager to make your experience enjoyable. I highly recommend Casbah ; I feel consistency plays a huge factor in the success of a restaurant."}
{"text":"My bf took me here on my birthday and it was so good he totally sealed \"the deal.\"    This was on of the best dining experiences I've had in Pittsburgh...made even sweeter by the fact I left full, and without feeling the boyfriends wallet was just raped.    I had the Orichiette pasta and it was love in a bowl.  Savory and sweet and perfectly balanced.  Boyfriend had short rib ravioli and it was so good that when I asked him if I could have a taste he told me that he loved me, and he knew it was my birthday, and he let me have a bite, but he didn't want to share.  I didn't make him, I just know it was excellent.  I have officially done dat all of the big burrito restaurants & I honestly feel like has bought is the most effortlessly sophisticated of all of them.  This is amazing food in a restaurant that is sophisticated without even trying.  I really feel like has bought is highly underrated and you'd best get your arse over here to dying. They have a brunch which I hear is amazing and I can't wait to try it out."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Casbah to celebrate my birthday one evening.  We were seated on the patio which was fine before a party of 20 was seated with a 1 year old who was banging his silverware on the table all night.  So much for romantic!  Ever hear of a babysitter?  Anyway, ambience aside, let's get to the food which overall I would give a C+.  We started with the veal and pork meatballs which were the highlight of the meal.  The perfect blend of sweet (fresh tomato sauce) and spicy -- the meatballs had a nice tang, and the polenta was delicious albeit there wasn't much of it there.  We each then had the heirloom tomato salad which was tasteless.  I grow heirlooms and know the intense and wonderful flavor they should have. These tasted like a grocery store tomato bought in December.  Very disappointing.  I opted for the cavatelli entree which was not prepared as described on the menu.  It was swimming in tomato sauce and overall was very bland.  Another disappointment.  My husband had the pork chop which wasn't bad but certainly didn't leave us wanting to return here for the food.  All this said, the service was professional, we enjoyed the drinks (he had the sangria and I their house cosmopolitan) and had a lovely bottle of wine.  I might return here for happy hour but it was not the right choice for a romantic special occasion dinner.  And we had the decency to hire a babysitter for our children, otherwise we would have stayed home."}
{"text":"Good food - Great atmosphere!  Service will depend mostly on where you sit - They have a nice covered outdoor seating, if you're out with a group of friends - The bar area is pretty neat with lounge seating facing the bar.  Try the Short Rib Ravioli"}
{"text":"Great food and very nice decor, one of my favorite restaurants outside downtown Pitt.  The best places around Pitt are the bars or bar/restaurants (some of the best in the country IMO).  But if you're looking for a straight-up classy place to eat, it's a tough place to beat."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh has many excellent restaurants, and Sunday brunch at Casbah is well worth adding to your culinary \"bucket list\". Everyone in our party of four chose the prix fixe brunch at $28, which included a brunch cocktail, an appetizer and a main course. Preparation and creativity was wonderful, which meant that standard brunch choices such as a smoked salmon appetizer or a tomato and basil bisque were standouts. The same can be said of entrees, such as the Casbah Benedict, the braised lamb and eggs, or the other egg dishes tried by our group. Service was professional and the experience was special."}
{"text":"I got my Big Burrito birthday meal voucher in the mail, and I couldn't decide which place to try.  I am a huge fan of Eleven and Mad Mex, but I wanted to try somewhere new.  I had previously sampled Casbah's food when they catered the dinner for Quantum Theater's production of Tamara.  I enjoyed the food at that event so I settled on coming here.  The atmosphere of Casbah is really cute.  It's slightly upscale, but you will still feel comfortable in nice jeans.  There is a Mediterranean theme to the atmosphere, but I don't know that the food is themed that way, despite what Yelp says.  I ordered the Lamb Macaroni and Cheese because I am a Mac and Cheese addict.  The portion was exactly lunch sized, and it came with a small salad.  The salad was really just a spring mix of lettuce with an oil dressing, but it tasted good.  The mac and cheese was delicious.  Plenty of lamb and lots of cheese.  It was on the creamy side of the mac and cheese scale.  I would order it again, but I would also like to try other things on the menu.  My friends ordered a sandwich and one ordered a bowl of soup.  The sandwich eater felt her turkey sandwich was pretty standard, but it was a turkey sandwich.  The soup eater was a fan.  Again, I plan to come back and test other things.  As a side note: The catered meal I previously tried was family-style chicken with potatoes and veggies, I believe.  It was good but not what I would expect after seeing the menu for them to serve.  I think you are safe to try just about anything here, really.  The only odd thing was that the servers really seemed to be fighting for tables.  Everyone was trying to get our drink and food orders, to the point of it being a touch aggressive.  Not a big deal just an observation."}
{"text":"Great stuff here...The cheese plates are great and always changing. Awesome staff, and the menu offers an nice variety!!  Ask for Tim for your waiter!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation for Saturday night dinner and arrived timely.  THREE times over 20 minutes the hostess told us they were setting our table.  There were 3 or 4 empty tables we could see as we waited, yet we were not seated. No one was seated at those tables  Not sure what the deal was with the hostess.  Also, she was extremely rude.  However, our server was delightful and the food was delicious.  Too bad the evening started out on the wrong note. Management needs to give some lessons!"}
{"text":"Most incredible food I've had in a while. We got the Duck and Short Rib Ravioli, and both were incredible!  Service was very mediocre, had to wait for them to refill my water quite a few times and took a while for our waitress to get our order. But the food is totally worth lack of 5/5 service."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow but overall the best food I've had in Pittsburgh so far. If you're a seafood fan, the scallops are amazing. Very decent wine list and lots of parking."}
{"text":"Made a reservation on opentable for Friday at 6pm.  It wasn't packed at all but the hostess decided to sit us outside without asking where we'd prefer to sit. It was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable.   I immediately noticed that a lot of CMU undergrads worked there. While I was dining there I saw 3 CMU classmates.   I started off with the gazpacho and it was very tasty. We were also given some bread with a lavender goat cheese spread. The spread was ok.   For the entrees I got the roasted pepper cavereccia that had crab in it and ricotta cavatelli with sausage.  For the cavereccia I thought there was going to be big chunks of crab but I was disappointed to see that the crab was shredded into small pieces. The pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok.  The cavatelli was extremely oily. The more you ate it the more you saw the pool of oil it was swimming in. I had to wipe some of the oil off the pasta.   Lastly I had the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. It was pretty good but I wish there were more raspberries in it.   Service was pretty good and the decor outside was nice, although, it got really stuffy in the outdoor tent.   This place is pretty expensive and based on the food I wouldn't go back for that price."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Casbah several times, each of which have been wonderful experiences. The menu is varied in flavors and and ingredients, allowing customers to pick both intricately spiced, more exotic dishes, or plainer more traditional dishes. Any pallet can find something great here. I usually order the Long Island Duck or the Pork Chop. Wholesome, well plated, and delicious. Desserts are yummy, and the coffee is fantastic. I drink it black.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is lively yet relaxed, the heated patio area gives a warm Mediterranean feel, even in the coldest winters of Pittsburgh. Downstairs seating is spacious and ideal for larger parties: a great choice for a graduation meal!  My family and I tend to eat here, and we always have great waiters. Able to answer our questions, and talk naturally and passionately about the items served on their menu. My mom is very picky with her wine and meal specifications, and they always handle her with grace and respect. Casbah is a wonderful choice for a fancier evening, with no distasteful posh to follow."}
{"text":"Casbah had some hits and some misses.  We started with the gazpacho and the mussels, which were the highlights of the meal.  Unfortunately, the tuna (although marketed as being seared) was overcooked.  The short rib ravioli seemed like a good choice, but was a bit oversalted.  My extra stars are more for Casbah's ambience.  The covered and lit patio is pretty romantic, so I would suggest drinks and appetizers with a reservation on the patio.  The staff was VERY attentive...maybe a little too attentive.  But this was probably because we came on a Thursday.  I've heard that it gets pretty busy during the weekend, so reservations are a must.  The menu overall looks really tasty, so I may go back to try a few more dishes...but not before trying some other places in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I celebrated our 5th year anniversary here and couldn't have been happier with our choice. The atmosphere and staff were great. Our food was also really delicious!  Update: came back a second time and the food and service was still superb! I love, love this place and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I like this place very much, and find it to be reasonably vegetarian-friendly. You have to know what to order, though, to get the best deal, because some things are just plain overpriced.  You should definitely stop in for lunch and get the Piccola Gusto menu - it is a great deal and is plenty of food. You get to try so many awesome things, and it's possible for every component to be vegetarian! It is a way better deal than ordering any one item - they are pretty expensive.  I've also been to a dinner party catered there (in the nice outdoor tent area), and they had a great antipasti platter and various pastas we could try. There were actually multiple vegetarian options, which I really appreciated.  I would give this place a 5, but it would be nice if the vegetarian options experienced as much rotation/creativity as the meat ones. I love the mafaldine, but it is consistently the only veg pasta on the menu. But service, ambience, and food are all great."}
{"text":"Passed this restaurant for years on my way to Buffalo Blues or more recently Mad Mex but have never actually eaten here.  Having finally come for lunch, I overall enjoyed it but it had some ups and some downs.    I ordered the Piccola Gusto Menu which for me included the Cream of Cauliflower soup, the Orecchiette Pasta and the Roasted Turkey Sandwich.  It sounds like a lot of food but the pasta serving is mini and it's a half sandwich.  For me, the size was just right.  The soup was awesome, and I could have eaten an entire lunch of just it.  The pasta was a little too creamy for me and just didn't have enough seasoning or spice.  I did love the addition of the cranberries in it though.  The perfect amount of sweet to offset the cream.  The roast turkey sandwich was just that.  Not out of this world, but not bad.  My biggest complaint was the service.  It took a really long time to get our meals which is always a bad thing during a weekday lunch.    I'd like to go back here for a happy hour when it's warm so I can enjoy the covered patio though and a nice glass of wine!"}
{"text":"I went to casbah for a research group dinner. Pittsburgh was having a busy weekend due to the university graduation ceremonies. We were lucky to get a reservation for a Friday evening on the Thursday.   The cheese plates are a great starter. They really have some good choices. The rock octopus and the flatbread were nice too.  For the main course, I had the pork chops since I read good reviews about the dish. They were fantastic! I can still taste the juicy tenderness. Yum!   The desserts were delicious as well. I tasted the Chocolate pot de Creme, the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, and the creme bruelle. The Chocolate pot was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"OH MAN! My boyfriend and I came here after having a wonderful experience at Soba Lounge. Big Burrito Group does it again.  Casbah prints their menu daily so some of their dishes you see online won't be offered that day. You'll still find something delicious, though.  We thought the place looked kind of shoddy when we saw the front of it, but it turns out they pitch up a tent-house in front of the actual restaurant to make their usual outdoor seating into additional seating during the wretched Pittsburgh winter.  Our bread came with a walnut pecorino pesto and it was AMAZING. We were kind of disappointed that they only gave us 4 slices but the food we had ordered came out so quickly afterwards that we barely had time to mope about it.  I ordered the long island duck, with chestnut spaetzle, brussels sprouts, sage,  apples, and cherries. The tanginess of the cherry and mild fruitiness of the apple was an amazing complement with the rich meatiness of the duck jus. I didn't think there was enough sauce but both the duck breast and duck leg were so tender I didn't care. I ended up almost finishing the entire plate even though the serving size was considerably large. All of that for under $30.   My boyfriend got the lamb shank, which was a super simple dish (lamb with mashed potatoes) that they managed to make out of this world. Super tender with a generous amount of lamb jus swimming around the plate.   For dessert, please get the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. It takes a while for it to come out because they bake it on the spot. The 10 minute wait is so worth it. There are huge chunks of super dark chocolate and fresh raspberries in the fluffiest bread pudding I've ever had. Just remember not to burn yourself on the plate like I did.   The meal ended with complimentary salted caramel. Don't put the whole thing in your mouth like I did."}
{"text":"I have been coming to casbah for what seems like forever-and thats a good thing. The atmosphere on the patio and by the bar is unique and makes for a relaxed setting. It is one of my favorite places to dine in Pittsburgh. Some favorites are the ricotta cavatelli (all timer) and their lamb dishes. We always start with a cheese plate and I think its one of the best in town. Keep it going Casbah for many more years to come!"}
{"text":"When I first ate here several years ago, I loved the service and food. For the most recent visit, however, I felt very disappointed in the service and food. The seating hostess sat us right near the door, and she sat other customers right near the other door and a fan, although the rest of the restaurant was empty. She did not find my Opentable reservation, so I received an email saying that I was a \"no show\" and \"When you miss a reservation, it can adversely affect the restaurant. So we kindly ask that the next time you need a rain check, please do what you can to cancel the reservation.\" The appetizers of scallops and tuna tartare tasted fine. The entrees of short rib ravioli and swordfish were not tasty and were thus hard to chew and swallow. The valet had parked our car right next to the restaurant, but we had to wait several minutes for him to drive the car a few feet to us, and then he expected a tip. We will never return to this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for her birthday, and the food really isn't particularly special.  Portions are decent, and I guess the prices are reasonable... if they had better food.   The outside of restaurant makes me think that the inside will be just as square and boring, but the inside patio area was pretty nice actually.  Overall, I just wasn't very impressed with the food.  If I was offered to eat this food for free, sure, I'd take a helping, but probably not seconds."}
{"text":"I love the Big Burrito group and I love even more that they just sent out a bunch of coupons. The other night, I got off early from work and was able to go to Casbah for dinner during the week.   When we got there, they took a minute to figure out where we would sit even though it appeared that they were empty. However,  1/2 way through dinner it seemed like they were seating those with reservations inside and walk ins outside.   The place is set up with what would be the patio, enclosed. There are big heaters on the ceilings that are directed straight at the tables. I will say that it was a little too warm and even though the host said he would turn them down, I don't think that was done.   The waitress came and told us about the menu, took our drink orders and brought us some bread with a yogurt spread and salted butter. I did ask her if the $10 off entrée coupon could be used on the pasta entrées and I think at that point she began to think that we were poor young kids. But back to that later. . .   To start we shared the crispy calamari ($11) with capers, lemons, chili and parsley which was probably some of the best calamari ever. It was not chewy and it had the best sauce ever! We also ordered the grilled chickpea flatbread appetizer ($9) which I expected to be a flatbread but actually came as grilled pita with three separate dips - baba ghanoush, hummus and red pepper muhummara.   For dinner, I ordered the short rib ravioli ($24) which came with swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots and gremolata. This was the more decadent dish ever! When it first came, it had about 6 raviolis and didn't appear to be enough but it was more than enough!  My husband ordered the Casbah Double Cut Pork Chop ($27) which came with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream and a sage jus. The pork was very moist and the risotto was cooked perfectly. There were no left overs!  After this huge meal, we decided on taking a dessert to go. We both agreed upon the Dark Chocolate Rasberry Bread Pudding ($8). So I asked the waitress if it would travel well since we wanted to take it to go. At that time, she looked at me and asked if we had a toaster oven where we lived. . . Um yes lady we do, in fact we have an oven also AND we own our own home. Despite the comment, we took the dessert home and put it in the oven later that night and we were not disappointed.   Overall the meal was delicious, we got to use two $10 off coupons and I would highly recommend it to anyone. However, I still favor Eleven!"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch!  We have now made it a tradition to go to Casbah for Easter Brunch. The selection is fabulous and the portions are generous. My husband always gets the creamy polenta and raves about it. The lamb and eggs are perfectly cooked and the tomato bisque was divine. I could live on that soup.   We were disappointed to learn that they took the macaroons off the menu. They were my husband's favorite dessert. We didn't try any of the desserts this time because we were stuffed but I'm sure they're excellent!"}
{"text":"Let me say that my five stars are based primarily on the calamari appetizer ... it is SOOO good! The squid was very lightly battered and fried so briefly that it was tender and delicious. Seriously, it was one of the best I've eaten, and I've made it a point of sampling calamari. The entrees (short rib ravioli and cavatelli) were very good, too. As for the Carrot Cob for dessert, forget it. It only detracts from the otherwise wonderful meal."}
{"text":"For the record, I have returned a few times and still entirely stand by my original review from nearly 3 years ago. I will add that the food portions also seem to be decreasing! We went during happy hour last week and I had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam, bitters and lemon, sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up, but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a \"yes, it's got lemon in it.\" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, \"yes, it's a lemon and fig drink.\" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks.   Also, their bar seating sucks. The chairs are stationary and far away from each other, and a bit far from the bar for a shorty like me; my feet don't reach the foot bar on the chair either, so my legs fall asleep trying to sit there."}
{"text":"I am definitely the salt queen.  I literally salt everything from pizza, McDonalds French Fries (even though I know that they already have tons of salt on them).  I also salt ham and processed foods.   I always salt food before even tasting it.  Nothing is off limits when it comes to me and my salt shaker.  Well when my beautiful meal arrived I asked my server for the salt.  None of the tables had salt or pepper shakers on them.  As my server went to get me the salt shaker, I took a bite of my potatoes.  Whoa!!!!!  They were extremely salty!!!!   For the first time in my life,  I didn't add any additional salt to my meal.  For me to say something is \"very\" salty.... It is very salty.   Being the salt queen,  I stll  was able to enjoy and love my meal.  I am almost guarantee that the average person would not have enjoyed this food..  My friend also tasted my meal and immediately noticed the heavy taste of salt.  However he never salts anything so something with one grain of salt on it, he will be about to tell.    It really suprised me that such an upscaled restaurant would have this much salt added to their food.  I am sure that it was an error or something.  I have eaten here in the past and never experience so much salt.  Still my meal \"for me\" was delicious.  For the first time in my life, I am glad that I did not add any salt to my meal.    I do love Casbah alot.  It is probably my second favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Went here for the brunch prix-fixe menu- such a good deal! Drink, appetizer, and main course all for $24. First, we got a pastry basket with mini-scones, croissants and biscuits. I told myself I would eat half of each to try everything, but they were too tasty to resist! For appetizer, I got the granola and berries and my friend got the creamy polenta. Both were great options! The granola did not taste like anything you get in a box- could definitely tell it was made in-house. The creamy polenta was so different and delicious- will get that next time I go back. Was pretty full by this point but that didn't stop me from completing my  main course! I got the Casbah Benedict with Smoked Salmon and my friend has the Tuscan Eggs. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals and were stuffed by the end!"}
{"text":"This review is for brunch only! I've never been here for dinner...but been here quite a few times for brunch.  Casbah's brunch is a prix fixe...which at first seems expensive, but when you realize the amount of food you're getting, it's sooo not. You get an appetizer, entree, and drink (yes, a real drink, with alcohol) for just $24. I usually end up spending more at my other Big Burrito brunch spot, Kaya, so I consider this a pretty good deal.  They start you off with a basket of muffins and biscuits with honey butter on the side. And it's refillable. Try to restrain yourself from eating too many baked goods though, so you can get to the real food. For appetizers, everything I've had was pretty good (polenta and the salads have been my faves), but for the entree, there is only ONE thing you should order: The lamb & eggs!  Crusty sourdough bread topped with spinach topped with braised lamb shoulder and roasted garlic, topped with poached eggs. One of the best things I have ever eaten in the morning. The scallop scramble is just okay, the steak & eggs are pretty delish...but the lamb & eggs is by far the best thing on the brunch menu.  This is one of the few places where I don't opt for the Bloody Mary...it's pretty blah. I do their Salty Dog with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, or sometimes get it sans alcohol if I'm really feeling the pain from Saturday night.  Unfortunately, while I love the atmosphere, I feel like the service is lacking. I can't explain why, but it always feels awkward and doesn't hold up to the standards set at other Big Burrito spots (even Mad Mex). I know it gets busy on Sundays, but still. Service issues aside, The food is still worth it."}
{"text":"I had a free entree from Big Burrito for my birthday, for which we decided to use at Casbah a few weeks ago. It was my first time there, though I've tried a few other BB restaurants in the past.   Food:  - Cracked pepper butter was delicious - I had to warn the waitress not to let me have any more bread and ruin my meal! - Grilled Bruschetta (ricotta, fava beans, Swiss chard,  preserved lemon, arugula, chervil, Calcagno) was a bit too lemon-y for my liking - Short Rib Raviolli (Short Rib Ravioli, Swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots, gremolata) was very savory and I would definitely order it again - Double-Cut Pork Chop (with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream, sage jus) was Joe's meal. I tasted a bit of everything and really enjoyed the kale. I like really really creamy risotto, and this wasn't quite there. I dont want to say it was undercooked, as I like I just like mine over-cooked. - Fried Apple Empanadas (vanilla bean cider reduction, toasted oat streusel,   caramel ice cream) The ice cream was great, but the empanadas were bland to me.  Service: Not terrible. I understand at nice restaurants people enjoy taking their time to relax, enjoy their meals, and converse with their dinner-mates, but our server should have been more observant to the fact that we would be just sitting there with empty places waiting for the desert menu. I will note, though, that the table next to us returned two glasses of the same wine and the bartender came over and very politely suggested an alternative wine for the patron. They were very accommodating in this way.   Will I go back? Someday - but I think I may try Soba or Kaya first."}
{"text":"Always a great experience dining at Casbah. A very romantic setting in the evenings with a great foodie experience of flavors and uncommon dishes. We really enjoyed the whole experience and the service was impeccable. Food is expertly prepared and the atmosphere makes it a great place for a date."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent food, always spectacular service. In my humble opinion, one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh hands down."}
{"text":"I got the Chilean Sea Bass.  It was the perfect portion.  Cooked and seasoned perfectly.  I really wanted to try the Ciopinno but they were out.  :("}
{"text":"Casbah is more like a 3.5 but I rounded down:)  We arrived after happy hour at Soba, apparently owned by the same people, for dinner.  There were four of us, and they started us out with delicious drinks.  I had the margarita topped with Malbec which was surprisingly yummy.  For appetizers we tried the meatballs and the grilled trip of flatbreads with mediterranean dips.  For mains, I had the rare seared tuna, Andrea had the salmon, and Allejandro and Elie both had the gnocchi.  Everything was ok to start and the mains were all good, although they rely heavily on butter and huge portions for their mainstay of flavor and satisfaction.  It was interesting to have such big portions after NYC where I'm used to portion control, but I decidedly prefer more reasonable portions (maybe somewhere in between).  All in all, a nice garden, pleasant and a good place for conversation."}
{"text":"I come  to Casbah annually for my birthday. The Big Burrito company gives out a free entree for your birthday to any of its restaurants of you sign up on their mailing list.   This year I went with the salmon. It was the first time I was asked how I wanted it cooked. I took the server's suggestion and went with medium well. It was a little pink but not dry. It was served over a bed of greens and carrots. I also ordered the calamari. I think I likes that the best. It was peppery and it had a great kick. The bread and butter dip the serve at the beginning is also really good.   If you're looking to have a more upscale dining experience without breaking the bank, I recommend Casbah."}
{"text":"Lovely, relaxing atmosphere. The cauliflower soup with tarragon emulsion was fabulous, as was the tomato basil soup. The waiter was attentive and happily allowed for a substitution on my salad so I could try one of the raw milk cheeses from their cheese sampler. The grilled chicken breast on my salad was a bit more dry and hard than I like, but I am not a big fan of barbecuing chicken and it certainly seemed to have been charred that way. If the chicken had been moist, this place would get all five stars from me!"}
{"text":"I have been here two time on my birthday. I have not a single bad word to say about this restaurant. Everything is delicious and everything leaving the kitchen is made with care. The staff is friendly and the space is inviting."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants EVER. The service was phenomenal and the food was to-die-for. The alcoholic drinks were so yummy as well. The meatballs and the duck were big winners. Everything was fantastic! HIGHLY recommended! The prices are high but well worth a night of fine dining!"}
{"text":"Casbah was more than a little disappointing.. I came to celebrate a family member's birthday and we were seating in the basement room. The whole dinner was 3 hours long. It was just too long. They didn't check up on us anywhere near enough. They were friendly of course, but it wasn't enough! 3 hours for 3 courses just didn't feel good!  The menu had two vegetarian options. I have noticed that many of these more upscale places tend to have risotto or pasta as their fallback vegetarian option, and it was certainly the case here. I ordered the pasta and it was $20 and one of the tiniest portions I've seen. The problem is, for that price, every bite should have been exciting and new. It should have been heaven. It wasn't. It was plain and there were more onions than pieces of rigatoni. I saw many of my meat eating relatives seemed to enjoy their meals. They ordered scallops and short ribs and huge chickens. But my pasta was so horribly disappointing. I'm not coming back!"}
{"text":"This was an amazing brunch place! A family friend asked me grab brunch here because her son used to work here as a chef/cook. The food was divine! The brunch comes with a cocktail, an appetizer  and then your meal. The coffee was really good and the mimosas were strong. We sat outside on the patio and it was just beautiful. A perfect retreat from the snowy outside that morning. Definitely go!"}
{"text":"I am leaving a 2 star review only because in the  past I have had amazing dinners here. But tonight, I asked the chef to substitute oil for butter as I have a severe dairy allergy (which they've done in the past) and was told 'No.'. Why? I have no idea. I told the very sweet waiter that they had made the substitution before, but apparently tonight's chef could care less. What a disappointment. To be willing to pay nearly $40 for an entree only to be told that they won't substitute oil for butter. I was unable to eat anything on the menu as they weren't open to making any exceptions. Needless to say we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate closing on our new home and was not disappointed! We got seated out onto the \"patio\" area which was enclosed. Ambiance wasn't bad but I wasn't pleased with the table and seats. Wish we could of sat inside the actually place, think I would of felt more comfortable. Server was nice and knowledgeable about the menu but service was slow at time we had a good wait to check out. The food was phenomenal though. We got the charred Spanish rock octopus appetizer which was decedent and tender. My boy friend got the Coriander Crusted Swordfish, rapini, oven roasted tomatoes, spring mushrooms, confit garlic, basil, and grapefruit vinaigrette. It was cooked perfectly and was juicy and melted in your mouth. I ordered the Red Pepper Casereccia Pasta, pan seared sea scallops, jumbo lump crab, roasted garlic, and parsley butter.  I never had anything quit like it and the flavors were amazing and melded so well together. We really enjoyed the food but expect a wait for drinks and service. We went on a Monday evening around 6:30PM and they do take reservations"}
{"text":"I came for the Sunday brunch prix fixe menu - you get one appetizer and entree with a classy cocktail. I made reservations online a few weeks in advance, and the restaurant, even with decent indoor and large outdoor (with heat lamp) seating, became pretty packed.   For the appetizer, I was able to try the Granola, Fruit and Yogurt, the Tomato & Basil Bisque, and the Mushroom and Celery Root Puree, and all were equally delicious. The mushroom and celery root puree I was a little wary of, but it was delicious.   For the entree, I tried Steak and Egg, Sea Scallop Fry, and the Braised Lamb & Eggs. The portions were substantial and the flavors were all there. The runny yolk with the steak and lamb were glorious. They also have other standard brunch entrees, such as a benedict and waffles, but I felt like this was something you can get anywhere.  Overall, really satisfied with the brunch we had. The outdoor seating was beautiful, and the heat lamps kept us pretty warm in the winter."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant, lovely decor!  I have lived literally 2 blocks from here for 5 years and I can't believe it took me this long to eat here.  Yes, a bit pricy for sure, but the service is friendly and the quality of the food was worth every penny.    We got the cheese appetizer (the wine and cheese combo is a close favorite second to paring wings and hard cider, and a little bit classier), which was one of the best things I've eaten in a long time.  Perhaps I don't get out much, but pairing cheese with some fresh fruit spread/preserves is really quite underrated.  The calamari appetizer was drizzled in a butter garlic to-die-for sauce.  Wine was plentiful, and the tuna steak perfect.   A bit pricy (for a grad student budget anyhow) to go back super-frequently, but I do hope something comes up soon to celebrate, so I can justify eating here again."}
{"text":"My first dining experience at Casbah was a nice one.  We ordered the cheese plate to start and I and I had chicken for my entree.  The wine list was not huge, but the selection was nice.  The service was very good.  I plan on returning there in the future for a meal."}
{"text":"Every time I have been to this restaurant it's a great meal great memory just lovely. Highly recommend for anyone looking to have a great meal anytime for any reason. Congrats to the chef on the duck and octopus!! Bread pudding dessert will not disappoint anyone."}
{"text":"The interior is very nice. The food is a hit or miss. We went for brunch today. You can select a drink (alcoholic or non), an appetizer, and a brunch entree for the price of $22. The appetizers we had (pollenta and squash&chestnut soup) were very good. The entrees, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. We got the mushroom omelet and jumbo lump crab and tomato omelet. The omelet was very bland. It did not have much flavor and needed seasoning and more ingredients than just eggs. Basically, I have had better omelets at some Denny's. My drink mimosa was just OK. My girlfriend's blood mary was delicious, though -- uniquely spicy.   I have been to Casbah 4 times, last time being for brunch today. The first time, it was good, worthy of 4 stars. It gradually went down to 3 stars. The wine selection is good. But the food is definitely hit or miss. Once I had a halibut that smelled like the ocean. It was not well cooked or fresh, or something. Consistency is the key in a nice restaurant; Casbah leaves much to be desired in this regard."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the food at Casbah, and last night was no different.  But I did not enjoy the noise level - it was very loud, and I thought the portions were quite small.  I had the butternut squash risotto with pear salad for $24.  I expected a complete meal, and I was not satisfied."}
{"text":"Meh.  Seriously?  Mediterranean?  What?  Sorry, but just because you serve scallops on babah ganoush doesn't make your restaurant Mediterranean.  This was kind of a disappointment, if you couldn't tell by my sarcastic tone.  The food was good, and I had a great time, but the food lacked the final eyebrow raising component that you come to expect with the bill that follows.  That said, the wine list was good and the prices were reasonable relative to the food.  Get the cheese course for dessert and you'll go home happy."}
{"text":"I think Casbah is a bit underrated. Pittsburgh has a number of very good restaurants: Legume, Meat and Potatoes, Butcher and the Rye, Eleven, and Cure make up the pentagon of the best places in town. Casbah, along with Salt, are in that second tier.  My partner and I have been here for dinner twice. Each time, I thought the food was very good. I can't remember what my order was the first time we came here, but the most recent time I had a mushroom bisque soup, meatballs and the gnudi for the appetizers (split between the two of us), and the sea bass for the entree. I really enjoyed the mushroom bisque, but it's definitely for those who like strong mushroom flavors. The sea bass came on a bed of delicious polenta, which: I don't usually expect polenta to be amazing, but this one was. The sea bass itself was moist and flaky with tons of flavor. My partner had the lamb, and thought it was good but also suspected it might have been too raw inside (it was more than pink). The drinks were also quite good, if not stellar.  Casbah also has a very pleasant atmosphere, even though it's quite large inside. The wait staff is helpful without being in the way; one of my least favorite things is having a waiter or waitress ask me within seconds of getting my food how everything is (give me a few minutes to actually eat it, ok?) and mercifully nothing like that happened here. A very nice dining experience overall."}
{"text":"Can be moderately priced for lunch -- take advantage!  We had a cheese tasting simply because I *never* pass up Pleasant Ridge Reserve when given the opportunity.  They also choose a lovely soft sheep's milk and an herbed goat cheese from Cypress Grove.  Nice work but pricey -- only two slices of baguette and apple!  I had the romaine salad -- should have gone with a sandwich and the delicious looking truffle fries!  The feta and red pepper dressing were just too salty and rich for 1pm.  I spied a number of delicious looking sandwiches from my table...  Service was great and the waiter even went out of his way to answer a couple questions about the cheese selection."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio! The food was excellent, we had lunch there. Kind of an \"older\" crowd when we were there, but they gotta eat too!"}
{"text":"In order of consumption...the bar is energetic, but has the worst and completely immovable bar stools ever created. We were initially placed outside in the all year round patio...absolutely no atmosphere, so we asked for a table inside...20 minutes later we were inside which had a much better vibe. I started with the Blue Bay Mussels which were truly the best I have ever had, plump, juicy and perfectly complemented by the chorizo and white beans, absolutely sublime. My wife had the veal meatballs that were also delicious. For the entrees I had the lamb loin with couscous and my wife had the veal tortellini, although very tasty we oth agreed that both were too rich. My only criticism would be that ALL the entrees looked rich."}
{"text":"Went here for bruch and had their take on the classic eggs benedict.  I'm a huge eggs benedict fan and this was very good.  I opted for the prociuto as the meat option and I'm glad I did.  It gave the eggs enough flavor without having to add extra salt.    The potatoes were perfectly cooked and the fruit was tasty as well.  Had the bellini and didn't realize how I much I would enjoy it so I had two!"}
{"text":"I don't know of any place that comes to close to the quality of Mediterranean food offered at Casbah.  They have a daily menu that combines unique ingredients into a great blend.  My favorites on their menu are their spinach casareccia (which I customize with tuna steak instead of chicken) and their gnocchi (in that order).  They are open to customizing their menu so if you want half and half of each dish, they are happy to do that for you.  That is a huge plus for me.  They are safely my favorite Big Burrito restaurant"}
{"text":"We went to Casbah for my mom's birthday dinner with a group of lady friends.  It was a hot evening and one of our friends had called ahead to arrange a patio seat.  It is a beautiful patio, but no fans and was quite warm so plan ahead if you have people in your party who run a little warm.  We were there during their Festival of Pasta.  I should have known something was up when I checked out the pricing of the dishes and they seemed to be a very fair $13-19 per dish.  Our waitress was very busy and hadn't had a chance to explain what the festival meant until we were ready to order when we were informed that to make a true meal, they recommended ordering 2-3 pastas per person or ordering many for the table to share as each meal only contained 2-3 ounces (!!!) of pasta per order.  Uhhh...I don't know about you but paying $13-19 bucks for 2-3 ounces of pasta seemed pretty darn pricey.  We then had to re-group and wait to place our order with this new information.  We all decided on a soup or salad in addition to our sole pasta dish.  For an appetizer we all shared the bruschetta.  3 pieces of rock hard bread with a cheesy spread, greens, corn and some tomatoes on it.  I think it was 12 bucks?  So like 4 bucks per piece of bread...it was okay but the bread was entirely too crisped.  I had the peach gazpacho soup and did really enjoy it.  It fit the warm night perfectly.  I didn't get the addition of a plop of avocado in the middle of it, but who doesn't love avocado so I rolled with it.  For my meal, I thoroughly enjoyed my 2-3 ounces of cavatelli with fennel sausage, ricotta, spinach and crushed tomatoes.  It was really delicious.  I would have loved more!!  I made sure to use the bread to sop up every last drop of sauce.  However, my mother had ordered the lasagna for her meal which was your pretty classic marinara and bechamel sauce containing lasagna.  It was plated on literally a small side plate and the whole piece of lasagna was probably about 1.5-2 inches squared.  It honestly looked insultingly small, this tiny piece of lasagna, on an itty bitty plate.  Just put it on a real plate or something that could pass as a real plate!  It just seemed to highlight that you are paying a good chunk of change for a few bites of food.  The lasagna was also dried out and just pretty blah.  For dessert we tried the dark chocolate bread pudding. It was the first thing we ordered all night that came out looking like it was actually meant to leave you feeling full.   Bread pudding is like one of my all-time fave desserts and this was good...but not the best.  However, this would be a great dessert to share because it actually came with food!  Overall, we had a good time but definitely it was because of the group of people we had together, and not much to do with the food.  I gotta say that I love a fancy restaurant here and there, but this just did not feel worth it to me.  I do not think I will be back."}
{"text":"Ah, the Piccolo Gusto Menu for lunch. For $15 choose soup or salad, plus a half sandwich, plus a pasta. You are not limited to a few choices. It is really difficult to come up with a trio because it is all so good. The tomato soup is amazing, but that is just a start. The short rib ravioli is to die for. It is really hard to narrow it down .... Treat yourself to a sumptuous lunch in a beautiful restaurant with great service.  PS: you must have bread!"}
{"text":"Thursday night January 30. Excellent service and excellent meal. Very crowded when we went. Glad we had reservations on open table. My wife had scallops, I had the signature pork chop. Both were perfect. We loved the octopus appetizer."}
{"text":"I ate here for brunch on Sunday.  It's $22 and you may have to roll yourself out after.  It included a mimosa/bloody mary, appetizer, and main plate.  I had the fruit and cheese along with the brioche french toast.  All was great.  They could have had some more flavorful cheeses, but the atmosphere and kind service made up for the lackluster cheese.  The bacon and potato fingerlings were absolutely amazing!  I will definitely be returning for brunch!"}
{"text":"It's a little pricier than most places in the area but the quality and ambiance is well worth it.    The food was really good and the drinks were relatively reasonably priced for the surroundings,  great place to take a date...or spouse."}
{"text":"PROS: Some of their plates are most definitely unique in terms of ingredients and flavor. Portions are great and flavor was really good.  CONS: Desserts were average. Large portions but nothing special.  PARKING: Challenging given you need to find street parking only.  All-in-all, I enjoyed the overall experience there in terms of service, food quality and ambiance. I'd go back."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary dinner; we eat out a lot and this has been by far our best dinning experience. They have a massive wine list if that's your thing, I personally can't tell the difference between a box of wine and a $200 bottle but i had a glass with my meal and it tasted remarkably like wine. I had the scallops as an appetizer and my fiancé had the sheep  milk gnudi both amazing! For the main course i had the most tender and juicy steak I've ever eaten (chewing was optional) with woodland mushrooms that melted in my mouth. Highly recommend this for special occasions or a romantic evening."}
{"text":"Brought my wife here for her birthday and we were lucky enough to arrive on the last of three nights of the truffle dinner. I saw it online before I arrived and dismissed it, but our server (Amanda) sold us on it when we got there. In fact, her thorough and enthusiastic descriptions of each course (including each cocktail and cheese) were a highlight of the meal. Sometimes over the top (\"people say it's the best meal they have had in their life\" and \"the chef took this week off so he could enjoy the meal as a customer--and it brought a tear to his eye\") but we genuinely loved it.   First, she made excellent suggestions on the cocktail (mimosa) and she helped us decide on the rest of the meal. Her recommendation to split the truffle dinner and add an appetizer was perfect. We left completely satisfied.   The cheese was very good and the accoutrements well-paired. When I saw it on the plate, I didn't think it was very much but it ended up being the perfect amount. I also appreciated that they kept the bread coming, especially for the next course: a homemade pasta with pancetta, arugula and"}
{"text":"New to Pittsburgh, and so I was delighted to find a high end restaurant. I made a Friday night reservation for two (with new girlfriend)-- i would not recommend arriving without a reservation.  Upon arriving I was impressed with their service, and found the waiters very friendly and accommodative. Restaurant has an exterior patio, which I would see as an asset in warmer months.  The interior section of the restaurant is a bit cosier ( ie closely stationed tables) than I prefer, but 8the restaurant has a romantic ambience.  The other patrons were largely an old crowd (+60 yrs old) and dressed their age.  I did not find young trendy people like myself dining there, but maybe it just happened to be that night.  The food was delicious and the wine list quite robust.  The staff also know their wines very well.  Didn't have time for desert, but I'll return one day for their desert.  For guys that want to  impress a lady,  this place will do it 97% of the time."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday night for dinner by myself.  It had been a couple of years since I had last been to Casbah and while I remembered it being decent, it differed a bit from my fiance's opinion that this was the best of the Big Burrito restaurants.  Due to that it had been on my list of restaurants to visit so that I could get a better opinion of it.  The restaurant looked the same that I remembered it with a large outdoor seating area and a smaller one inside with the bar on one side of the restaurant and the dining room on the other.  It was all nicely and tastefully decorated.  I arrived shortly after 5 PM and immediately made my way into the bar area of the restaurant as I hate taking up a table if I am eating by myself.  There was no one else at the bar at this point and the bartender quickly greeted me and gave me a happy hour menu while explaining it to me.  I had not been planning on getting a drink but one of the $6 cocktails caught my eye and I ended up ordering it.  The bartender was pretty friendly guy and explained how he came up with the drink while he made the drink and we chatted for a bit.  For my entrée I decided to order the Long Island Duck which was a roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, rosemary, black mission figs and duck jus.  Whenever I had ordered it I had actually missed the fact that it came with a braised leg and was excited to see that extra unexpected portion of meat on my plate whenever it was delivered to me.  The whole meal ended up being incredibly tasty with the duck breast being cooked perfectly with nice seasoning and not greasy at all.  This was in stark contrast to the leg which was incredibly juicy and greasy which I absolutely loved.  Normally I am not a fan of greasier duck but the two preparations really helped to enhance the other.  Finally the figs provided a nice touch of sweetness while the gnocchi was pillow like and tasty.  It was also nice to be able to taste a hint of rosemary on them which I had forgotten about between the time I had ordered and when it was delivered.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  Both my cocktail and my meal were really good and I would actually consider this to be one of the best meals that I have eaten in a little while."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and the atmosphere is very romantic! My boyfriend and I came here for date night and I really enjoyed my evening. The complementary sourdough bread started our nights off well, which was followed by the Sea Scallops appetizer and Calamari appetizer, which was followed by delicious entrees of Duck and Lamb Shank, and then finished off with coffees and Chocolate Tiramisu Cheesecake. The food came out fast, and the service was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"The Big Burrito chain, which Casbah is a member, can't do wrong in my eyes.  Casbah delivers one of the best brunches in Pittsburgh.  And bonus, while located in busy and crowded Shadyside, they have free valet parking.  So no complaining about finding a spot to park.  The set up is neat.  There is a very large front patio that is covered (and heated in the winter) that provides a nice California-esq ambiance.    So many great choices for brunch that begin with a basket of delicious muffins, scones and breads.    You have to choose the pre-fix if you're going to have a Bloody Mary or mimosa, because that is by far the best deal.  Or, you can just order your entree and still get a fair deal.  I had the eggs Benedict, which is basically perfect.   I've been here at least three times now for brunch and once for happy hour.  I need to get back for happy hour because they have some nice specials, good apps, and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I recently realized that I had only given Casbah four stars after my first visit here for New Year's Eve 2012... What a terrible judgment call that was on my part. So I'm back to proclaim that over a year later - having dined here again in 2013 - with a year of dining experiences across the country -  I still regularly dream of this restaurant. Do I dare say it's my favorite restaurant? I'm not sure, but if it's not my favorite, it's certainly close.  We returned after NYE last year to celebrate my birthday in March, making sure to bring along the oh-so-coveted Big Burrito birthday coupon. I ordered the Orecchiette with Chicken, Cranberries, Goat Cheese & Sage Cream. Oh. My. Goodness. Don't order this if you're on a diet... but order this if you love delicious food and living life to the fullest. It was ridiculously creamy, and the cranberries packed the perfect fruity balance to the rich dish. My husband ordered the Double-Cut Pork Chop with Kale & Butternut Squash Risotto. While recently dining at a highly rated restaurant in NYC, he said, \"My double-cut pork chop at Casbah was better than this double-cut pork chop.\" That's when I knew that I needed to update my review of Casbah.  Finally, my delicious birthday dinner ended with the Dark Chocolate-Raspberry Bread Pudding. I love ordering bread pudding at restaurants, and I think this is the best of them all. I would confidently enter this dessert in a bread pudding competition, knowing that I would be walking away with the blue ribbon."}
{"text":"The service and food were both very good for the most part. However, the brunch menu was a bit expensive, as the drinks were not very strong."}
{"text":"Stopped here for drinks before we went on to dinner elsewhere. In hindsight, we wish we had stayed here. :-)  We had a couple of great beers and just enjoyed the excellent music soundtrack before we moved on to our next designation. I hope to come back here sometime in the future and actually have...a meal. I like this funkier part of town."}
{"text":"It's hard to judge and review based on takeout alone, especially at a place with such an atmosphere like Casbah, but here it's goes...  My boss decided to treat us all for lunch so I looked for something that appealed to me. I must admit that the menu scared me at first. It's definitely more of an upscale kind of place, but not quite a \"suit & tie\" affair. I settled on the bacon and turkey club. Seemed safe.   I didn't think it was anything amazing. Yes, I said it. I've been looking forward to eating here, too! The sandwich was just sort of... plain. The sauces were bland and did nothing for me. It all just seemed very dry. Aside from the tasty bread and bacon, I wasn't too impressed. For a cheaper price, I could have ordered a club sandwich from a mom and pop's greasy spoon and been more satisfied.   I also ordered a salad which consisted of lettuce and beets. Dressing was okay, but a little tangy.   All in all, I'd like to return and actually enjoy a meal in the restaurant. Atmosphere does a lot for a place so a trip back is definitely in order. Also, I'd like to actually study the menu and ask some questions to make sure I can order something good. At work I was a little rushed to make a decision.  Side note - the takeout packaging is awesome. High quality microwaveable/reusable plasticware!"}
{"text":"Oh, Casbah. I love when I get the opportunity to dine within your walls. Your food is delicious. My boyfriend and I enjoyed a lovely dinner this past weekend. Did I mention that it was his birthday?  We were seated outside along the catwalk (aka, the walkway from the front door into the main restaurant). It was a chilly night, so the heaters above us were pumping out the heat. I mean, it wasn't warm, it was h-o-t. Yes. It was better than freezing our tooshes off, but it was a bit, well, uncomfortable to say the least.  Now onto the positives...  We devoured the Veal & Pork Meatballs for an appetizer. The Anson Mills polenta, roasted tomato, garlic, crispy Brussels sprouts, and parmigiano-reggiano played very nicely together.  For our main entrees, I ordered the gnocchi. This wasn't just any gnocchi. Instead, duck confit, brussels sprouts, figs, lacinato kale, thyme, pecorino romano, and shag bark hickory nuts accompanied the fluffy little pillows of goodness.  He ordered the Casbah double-cut pork chop served with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream, and sage jus.  No dessert this time - trying to keep my New Year's Resolution.  See you soon, Casbah"}
{"text":"The food was perfectly lovely but not terribly special.. overall flavor profiles were on point but execution was not.  The wait staff was professional but like the food... There was nothing particularly special about it either.  The wine was fantastic though. No complaints there and dessert was memorable. Overall I would go back if someone wanted me to join but probably not my first pick to go out in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"This place is terribly overrated and overpriced! The risotto was waaaay undercooked. Do yourself a favor and don't come here"}
{"text":"Better than expected. Great service. Had muscles, red pepper pasta (forget the name) with scallops and lump crab, husband had duck. Everything was cooked perfectly.   Waiter said he lived in many parts of the country and this was the best duck he's ever had and he was right. Only downfall is I didn't save room for s'mores dessert!"}
{"text":"Out of the Big Burrito group (not counting mad mex) this is probably the biggest disappoint of their chain. And this is just not a one time bad experience, I have been here three times and have been less than enthused with the food vs price/value.  Service has always been good and attentive I enjoy their wines and the selections but on almost every dish there is something is either wrongly out of place or I expected much better for the money I am paying. For example:  Sumac scallop Appetizer, cooked perfectly, but the tartness of the sumac was not there, the other thing is I can brown a scallop at home, in a restaurant I am looking for a perfectly cooked scallop that has a nice caramelized sear on it, almost crunchy top juicy center. Also why so stingy with the baba ghanoush, 1 tsp, come on, eggplant is that expensive.  Risotto - Over cooked not even a little bit of toothiness to the grain, plus it was pretty devoid of flavor but seemed to have had the addition of cream and butter to make it creamy.  Duck Entrée, again duck was perfectly cooked, quince jus was nice, not overly sweet but the faro did not compliment the dish at all. I even had a dining companion taste the combination and asked if they like it and they said it didn't go.  Pasta entrée with spinach, this could have been good, but spinach was not washed and had grit in it, this item was returned and a braised lamb dish was ordered in its place, the lamb was slightly undercooked (read just a little tough) and jus that went with it was very watery.  If this was some little bistro where I was paying $20-25 for dinner (no drinks) I wouldn't be so picky but some of my meals have been north of $40 and for that amount of money I expect a little more attention to detail."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my boyfriend, really excellent pasta and the service was great. They were running a weeklong pasta fest when we were here, with smaller portions of all their pasta dishes to encourage you to sample more different ones. We ordered the red pepper casareccia, rabbit pappardelle, and short rib ravioli. The scallops and crab meat in the casareccia were succulent and flavorful, I would definitely recommend! The pappardelle was my personal favorite, the rabbit added a wonderful peppery and rich flavor. We also had the tuna tartare and charred octopus to start. The tartare was delicious, wonderfully light and refreshing. The octopus, however was a weird candied texture due to the syrup they cooked it with, and was slightly too sweet. The creme brûlée was also a delicious sweet and rich end to our meal. Overall, I'd definitely go back for the pasta! Also, regarding the seating, there is an inside portion and an enclosed large outer porch room underneath a tent. We sat inside, but admired the decor, plants, and lights in the porch room which added a really inviting atmosphere and would definitely request for that the next time we make a reservation."}
{"text":"My boyfriend recently received very exciting news and wanted to go out on the town to celebrate it. My last experience at Casbah was excellent (minus the dining partner but that's another story) so I suggested dining there for this occasion and, since he is not from the area, he trusted my judgment (and my Yelp elite status lol) to choose a great restaurant. I actually made reservations for 8:15pm this past Saturday while I was on the way back from my vacation. Personally, I was quite surprised there was still same day dining availability, but of course I didn't question it. We arrived right on time and used the complimentary valet (get your ticket validated before exiting the restaurant) which was great, particularly since it was raining. We were seated inside and normally I would have rather dined outside but due to the rain, I actually appreciated the inside spot.   I began with a glass of Malbec (my new favorite go-to wine) and my bf had a Cab. We were brought bread which came with regular butter and another seasoned spread which was more flavorful. The bread was fresh and warm, much appreciated since we were both famished. We started off with a cheese tasting and chose the Jasper Hill \"Harbison\"; Vermont, cow's milk, soft; the Sardinia \"Calcagno\"; Italy, sheep's milk, hard; and the Misty Creek Goat Dairy Leon \"Leonora\"; Spain, goat's milk, soft. The tasting was accompanied by bread (I believe the same we were first served upon sitting down) and three spreads-a mustard, a fig spread, and an additional sweet spread, pinkish in color-possibly pomegranite spread. We both LOVED the tasting and all of the cheeses paired excellently with our red wine! We easily cleared the cheese board. For entrees, my bf had the Ricotta Cavatelli( house-made fennel sausage, spinach, crushed tomatoes, ricotta) and I had the Orecchiette (grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream). He devoured his pasta, however, I was able to sneak a small bite for it was entirely consumed and it was quite tasty! The sausage had a bit of spice to it that was very flavorful. I absolutely loved the orecchiette! The savoriness of the goat cheese compounded with the sweet tartness of the cranberries was heaven in my mouth! The chicken itself was quite flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly, not too firm yet not too soft. Another testament to the greatness of this dish is that my leftovers, heated in the microwave the following day, tasted just as good as the meal did when dining at Casbah! Unfortunately, we were stuffed to the brim and too full for dessert, which will be on the agenda for our next dining experience here. The only criticism I had this go-around was the service. We had a male server who was just not personable, unlike the last time I dined here and the server hit the ball out of the park with her friendliness, multiple suggestions and explanations, and knowledge of the menu. This server never introduced himself, mumbled and talked so quietly it was difficult to hear him, and rarely checked on us. My wine glass sat empty for quite some time before he came around and I had to ask him for a glass as he didn't offer if I'd like another. The main reason for dining out is the food, which was incredibly delicious so I will return, however, I hope next visit the service can match or exceed that of my first visit here since that exceptional service contributed to my wanting to return here again and this particular service made me feel quite undervalued as a customer."}
{"text":"Where to begin... from the decor to the staff to the food, I appreciate it all. I may be biased as this has become our go to special date night place, but I think I'd love it all the same on any random night as well. From the outside, it's unassuming and you wouldn't have any idea what's inside. My favorite room is the very first room as you walk in the door. It's like a Mediterranean garden filled with plants and tables with metal black chairs and white tablecloths. I always prefer to sit in this room because it doesn't feel like you're in Pittsburgh.   The menu is definitely more expensive than a typical night out. But the quality of their food is generally great. Recently I told the waiter I wanted the scallops, which were listed as an appetizer option, but she had the chef make it into an entree. I loved how accommodating they were and how knowledgeable about each dish she was. We had a lot of questions! My fiancé had the pork chop, which was recommended by the waitress, and he loved it! He still brings it up and we went 3 weeks ago.   I'd definitely recommend it for something a little different and a unique, upscale atmosphere."}
{"text":"Its an excellent place to grab a bit to eat with friends or family. I went with a number of relatives a couple of times while visiting and I really enjoyed the food plus a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once for drinks and once for dinner, and I'd have to say that generally, I'm a fan.  Their happy hour has some good deals - $6 cocktails and glasses of wine, and $1 of bottled beer.  It was a fun, trendy atmosphere and a nice place to go for a glass of sangria after a busy day.  I came back for dinner a month or so later.  We had reservations (on a Monday night) and were seated immediately -even though the restaurant was surprisingly busy.  We sat in the covered area out front - sort of like sitting in a dim, Mediterranean garden.  And yes - the lights are low throughout the whole restaurant.  Even with my young eyes, I still needed a candle to read the menu.  But it is romantic and a peaceful place to eat.  A little uncomfortable, as they have metal chairs (sort of like upscale patio furniture), but not a big deal.  Sit inside at a booth if you need to sit on something soft.  The menu is pricey and we're all poor, so we just got entrees.  I actually had a cocktail to start - the Perfect Pear - with elderflower liqueur, vodka, sage, pear, and vermouth.  There was even a little sage leaf floating in the glass.  It was a wonderful drink, with all the flavors I love.  Still, for the price, I think the portion was a little stingy.  When I buy an $11 cocktail, I like it to really fill the glass.  We nibbled on warm bread while we waited, and all tried their pesto on top - I think it was an unusual homemade pesto, something like walnut-watercress?  It was a bit bland - I think regular basil pesto would've been a better choice.  Things got better during the actual dinner.  I ordered the Heritage Farms Chicken which was juicy and fresh, and served with a tangy pasta.  Each little detail of the dish was well-chosen - honestly, even the grilled baby squash was outstanding.  It's just squash!  But somehow, it was heavenly.  My friend enjoyed her Cioppino, and my boyfriend liked his veal tortellini, complete with rich pieces of lobster.  I tried a little bit, and it was tasty - very herbal and really bursting with flavor.  The only dish that fell a little flat was the potato gnocchi - my friend's boyfriend ordered it.  Actually he liked most of it very much, but he couldn't get past the aggressive bitterness of the turnip greens.  I tasted them too, and I have to say - it was off-putting.  Perhaps that's just the way turnip greens are, but it really didn't work for us in the dish.  Fortunately, the waitress was incredibly kind and helpful, and brought him out a new plate sans greens, which he finished happily.  We also had a few desserts - vanilla bean creme brulee for us, flourless chocolate torte for them.  I didn't taste it, but apparently it was incredibly rich.  I enjoyed our creme brulee - because I enjoy all creme brulee - although the roasted quince on top didn't quite work for me.    Overall, the meal ranged between good and very good, but the great service from our waitress really pushed this to a 4 star rating.  I had hoped to be a little more wowed by the food.  But this experience was definitely positive enough to warrant a second visit for dinner.  I think it'd be a nice place to go for a special occasion, or if you feel like a little splurge on a flavorful meal."}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere, excellent service, food was also wonderful. Had the ricotta cavetelli and it was great. Meatballs and cheeses were great. Was a very good time and would definitely go back. Cocktails were unique and tasty."}
{"text":"I was pleased to finally find a place in Pittsburgh that's worth it for me to spend some money. I tire of eating out only to become dissatisfied knowing I could have made the meal better myself. Not here.  The food is made to order, seasonal, local, some organic...in short, they actually care about the quality of the food which is becoming a rare trait in restaurants today. I had made it a point to never eat fish in a Pittsburgh restaurant but Casbah changed my mind. The cod dish I had was delicious--not overcooked, breaded, too oily or too salty!   Decor is subtle and great for a date. Service was friendly and accommodating.  I will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by an employee at Evolve spa across the street and I was very happy with the restaurant. The Salmon appetizer was delicious as was the gnocchi meal. I will definitely go back to this restaurant when I visit the area."}
{"text":"This update is for Casbah's brunch.  Alright, Casbah. You got me, you got me good. Dinner as I mentioned before was decent, but the brunch, amazing. Compared to dinner, brunch at Casbah is definitely the better meal and deal. I don't advocate playing favorites when it comes to siblings in the same family, but sometimes you can't help it. Brother Brunch gets the nod here.  Brunch is basically a fixed set. For $28, you choose an adult beverage (or non-alcoholic), an appetizer, and an entree. They start you off with some pistachio scones, buttermilk biscuits, and cornbread. Perfect, I like to stretch before I get my grub on. For my Prix-Fixe (fixed set), I went with the mimosa, smoked salmon, and sea scallop fry.   SMOKED SALMON: If you like smoked salmon, then you would enjoy this appetizer. It's what you would expect but also a larger size than I thought it would be! \"Oh no, there's too much of something I like,\" said nobody ever. Upon seeing the smoked salmon display fanned out on its plate with bits of egg, red onion, and aioli garnished over top, my salivary glands couldn't control themselves!   SEA SCALLOP FRY: You know I love me some scallops. The dish came with two scallops, a small croissant, small bits of fennel sausage, a side of white corn grits, and a little bit of butternut squash and caramelized onions. I was tempted to go with the classic eggs/toast/waffle as an entree, but I am so glad I put on my big boy foodie stretchy pants and took a chance. It's not your typical brunch dish and it's one I would definitely recommend.   All in all, fantastic brunch experience. Definitely felt comfortably full, but not in a self-hatred, \"I-regret-this-decision-immediately\" kind of way. Service was professional; our waitress kept the waters filled and came in to check on us a little after each dish was served."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday day here. First time ever there, we were not disappointed!!! Great service, laid back atmosphere  and wonderful food!  The calamari and shrimp appetizer was the best we have ever had. A lemon cream sauce with Serrano pepper slices scattered over it.  Shared an arugula salad with crispy pancetta and a vinegrett dressing...excellent.  Dinners were fine as well!  Would recommend this to any one wanting a special occasion place to go."}
{"text":"I believe it was Aristotle who once said, \"Holy craaaaaaaaaaaaap!\" Based on the dining experience I had last night, I can only assume that he'd just eaten at Casbah when he said that.  Pittsburgh is a city that has no shortage of *amazing* restaurants and among those, Casbah is one of the best.  I went with my two kids (foodies at heart and who are both up for anything, always--no chicken nuggets for these two) and our experience, from the moment we crossed the threshold til we floated out after we were finished, was damned close to perfection.   First off, THE WINE LIST. Sweet niblets. I had a glass of Michel-Schlumberger Pinot Noir that was so good that my eyes actually crossed. CRAZY good. And the rest of the selection was just as impressive.   We were served a basket of hot-from-the-oven bread with sea-salted butter and this otherworldly strained Greek yogurt stuff with lemon that was so yummy I seriously considered licking the plate. Seemed reasonable at the time.   Appetizers were flatbread with hummus, baba ghanouj, and red pepper muhummara (sublime) and veal/pork meatballs with crispy Brussels sprouts that earned a resounding \"OMG!\" from the young uns.  The girl child ate--and swooned over--short rib ravioli, the boy devoured (and waxed rhapsodic over) his orecchiette with Elysian Farms chicken, and I lost myself in (and have pledged my troth to) the best cioppino I've ever eaten (San Francisco, eat your heart out).  But wait! There's more!  Dessert. Holy yum balls. Kid #1 had raspberry-chocolate bread pudding with crême Anglaise, Kid #2 had the chocolate cheeesecake bombe. Both kids were over the moon and doing things like pledging to clean their rooms every day (that must've been SOME dessert).   On top of all this, the service was AH-mazing. Every person who came to the table was funny and smiling and bending over backward to make the meal all it should have been. And it was.  I've eaten at a great many of this city's best restaurants and this was one of the best experiences I've had here."}
{"text":"I always love coming to Casbah!   Tips: have some cash for the valet          Use OpenTable to make your dinner reservation           Sign up for Big Burrito group mailers to get coupons           Happy hour: at the bar only from 5-7 $6 wine   This place is so intimate but not necessarily romantic. I always come with my fellow Elite Ashley for some good wine and amazing food. We went during the pasta festival which features half sized portions of most of their dishes. I opted for the full size since I was using my birthday coupon and had up to $30 off an entree.   The fresh bread and butters are always welcome after happy hour haha. We started with the grilled octopus appetizer and it was so flavorful. It had a nice char.   We both had the Red Pepper Casareccia. It's full of homemade pasta, crab and these out of this world scallops. These babies were big, had a great char on them and were so melt in your mouth creamy.  Can't wait for our next dinner there!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants in Pgh, Casbah is still going strong 15 years later. Today's lunch was a wonderful mac and cheese with braised lamb; my dining companion enjoyed the corn risotto with shitake mushrooms and a side heirloom tomato salad. They use the best fresh local ingredients to craft some of the most delectable, interesting fresh food around.  Also great for Sunday brunch.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My sister and I are the biggest restaurant critiques since we have worked in the service industry our whole lives. Casbah is by far one of the best restaurants I have ever been to in Pittsburgh. From the atmosphere to the waitstaff to the food! I literally do not have one bad thing to say about this place. You also get complimentary valet just for going there! I am definitely not a writer so I'm sure this is all over the place for most people. But long story short- go to Casbah!!!"}
{"text":"Great apps, when dinner arrived the risotto under my husband's porkchop was cold. We told the server, she took his food (not mine) so i was left to either let my food get cold or eat without him. So, after about 10 mins his food returned and his risotto was now crunchy (undercooked), he just ate the rest of his meal and we told the server at the end, her reply was \"im sorry to hear that\" - i would expect at a restaurant where that dish is $27 that this would have been addressed with a higher level of professionalism that would ensure the guests return....but, alas, it did not and we will not. Should have gone to soba as was our original intention."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for food, 3.5 stars for service = this 4 star review.  We visited for lunch today, opting for the piccolo gusto menu (2 courses for $15).  I had the arugula salad (delicious), my friend had the tomato bisque (tasty and not too tomato soup-esque), I had the cavatelli (very tasty although the pasta was a bit past al dente), she had the short rib ravioli (really tasty but only 2 ravioli???), and we both had the crab cake sandwich.  Our server brought out bread at the beginning of our meal--the bread was okay but nothing special; the butter was a nice sweet cream butter.  The crab cake sandwich was also quite small but somehow we were both full (probably too much bread beforehand!).  We also did the feature wine flight which was quite nice.  I'd come back for the wine and probably for the piccolo lunch.  On the service--our server was very distant and not particularly friendly.  She stopped back at all the right times, asked all the right questions, but left us feeling a bit chilled.  Maybe this is desirable at dinner time in the dining area, but for a lunch on the patio, I'd like a bit more engagement with the customers.  On the ambiance--Casbah is quite chic in the dining room, and the patio is more casual.  The patio is a slightly awkward mix of the two, though, as the wrought iron chairs are clunky and hard to move without obnoxious noises, and the hostess stand is located within the restaurant so everyone troops by the patio diners.  Contrast this with the upscale food and plating and it's a little strange, but not so off-putting to stop me from returning."}
{"text":"This might be the best food I've had in Pittsburgh.  The restaurant set up is a little odd in that there is a tented outdoor space that you walk through to get to the hostess stand. The hostess stand is located in the indoor space. We were seated in the outdoor section in a corner which was fairly drafty. This is the only negative point I have about the meal.  We ordered the cheese  tasting menu, the duck, the scallop pasta, and the lemon sponge cake. Each bite was perfect -- flavorful and expertly cooked. The waiter was friendly and knowledgable. We left feeling full and happy."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've never had anything that wasn't tasty here. They do fish and meat very well. It's not obscure molecular gastronomy style, but dishes we have had here were all well prepared and savory. We have been to several business dinners in their space downstairs, and it really is my favorite place for these - even more than the pricier steakhouses 'dahntahn.'  Wait staff were very attentive, and really made our experiences here great. Food was served efficiently for large groups, and arrived at the correct temperature. They have a great wine list, and overall offer a comfortable space with delicious food and drinks. Try the lamb loin, chicken, and cioppino - my three current favorites. Their pork chops are the specialty of the house, I'm told.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious Sunday brunch at $28 includes a cocktail, appetizer and entree. The food is super fresh, locally grown and they even had peach biscuits."}
{"text":"Although we've only had brunch here, I'm not totally sure that we'll be back for dinner service.  Casbah is a whopping .2 miles from home (that's at least a thousand feet!) so while its convenience and accepting of reservations reign high on my list of must-haves, the food left me slightly disappointed.  Considering the price point here, we've dropped a star level or so.  I made reservations for brunch (definitely do this; the place was full when we arrived at noon) and strolled through the patio(?) area to the actual(?) restaurant.  That set up is strange itself; especially with no indication of where I'm headed.  We were quickly seated in close quarters with our other lovely brunch eating brethren.  Service was fine.  We're easy guests, and our waiter was more than tolerant with the +1 having not scoured the menu to make sure he would like something there like I had.  We both opted to go with the prix fixe; with most items hitting the halfway point, 28 bucks seemed great for including an appetizer and cocktail.  My bellini was done right.  Fancy style, making all the schnapps (ha! sorry).  The appetizer of granola with a lil' yogurt that seemed more like cream cheese fatty goodness than the very vanilla yoplait lite I typically let myself have; a sprinkling of berries hit the spot.  Sweet enough for me--maple-y and rich--and didn't even for a second seem like someone poured some Nature Valley in a bowl.  The +1 ordered the cinnamon killed polenta and couldn't get enough.. so I barely got any.  Our entrees though are a different story.  +1 got the mushroom and goat omelet with his little roasted potatoes and his little sausage and his little toast and was all happy enough with it. I am not so easy, I guess.  The brioche French toast sounded great.  Caramelized pear! Sold!  I received, next to a large, meaty chicken sausage link, a few small pieces of fruit and one slice of French toast.  How is that a thing?  Maybe this is the husky child in me, but I was not expecting one slice.  Luckily with the prix fixe, there was no way I would have been able to eat more than one, but really.  If I had only ordered that at some double-digit menu price, I would not be a happy camper.  Overall, really, it was fine.  The food was actually better than I make it sound; it just didn't hit the expectations everyone had set for me.  The hungry girl me will always require more than one slice of sugar bread.  Curiosity of dinner with reservations might bring me back if I don't want to make the trek elsewhere with February arctic conditions again, maybe."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience! Food, service, and ambiance were all fantastic. The octopus appetizer was one of the best octopus dishes I've ever had, and the bread, pork chop, and short rib were all delicious. It's a little pricey, but worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Casbah four times since my first review - from cocktails and an appetizer to lunch, everything has exceeded my expectations and the service has been great every time: polite, helpful recommendations, and my glass is never empty. I continue to think that the Piccola Gusta lunch menu is a real value and has some really delicious options, but I would have dinner just to try those little candies they offer at the end of meal at dinnertime again - they are a cross between maple sugar and caramel, so good they're worth a star all by themselves."}
{"text":"Casbah has one of the most consistent kitchens in Pittsburgh. The menu only changes slightly from time to time, but it's always full of great options and the quality and preparation of the food is always top notch. The service doesn't disappoint either. I'm always amazed that they can nail it (food and service) every single time without fail. The bar area is a great place for drinks or dinner as well. Fiona behind the bar is always welcoming and fun and is perhaps one of the best bartenders in the city. It's also one of only a handful of good restaurants in the city that is open on Sundays. Now if only they would replace the swivel bar stools that are bolted to the ground and make it challenging for some (especially smaller women) to dine while sitting at the bar or for couples to sit as close to one another as they'd prefer."}
{"text":"Casbah was one of the more romantic and intimate restaurants that I've been to in Pittsburgh. The front of the restaurant has extensive outdoor seating in a vineyard like atmosphere. The inside is split between a spacious bar/lounge and indoor seating. If you're interested in indoor seating, then you should make a reservation.  We started at the bar. Our bartender Andrew was very attentive and knowledgeable. He made a fantastic wine recommendation and provided great service as we waited for a table.  Once seated, we ordered some mixed olives to enjoy with their complimentary bread. The olives had a tasteful tangy and herby seasoning with paired well with the creamy yogurt spread provided with the bread. Next, we shared the seared scallops. The scallops were cooked perfectly. They had a delicious savoriness while maintaining the ocean aroma on the interior. I'd highly recommend the scallops.  For our main course, we shared the short rib ravioli. It was a very savory dish due to the gravy sauce it was served in. For dessert we had the milk sponge cake which provided a light, creamy, and fruity finish to a delightful meal."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful date night with my boyfriend here. We went on a Saturday night around 7:15 and there was no wait. Complementary valet parking! We had one glass of wine each, our own entrees, and desserts, and it came out to be $111. Fresh bread was also served!"}
{"text":"Amazing. My family and an out of town family (super foodies/winos) ate here once and ended up spending over 3 hours at our table, not because service was slow, just because it was a nice environment to chat away an entire evening.  We had tuna tartare that was amazing. I had halibut for my main dish that was incredible.  I didn't pay so I'm not sure what the bill ended up being but I'm sure it dented someone's wallet.  While waiting for our entire party to show up we hung around the bar which was very swanky but not in an overly fancy way.  Service was perfect. Would love to go back."}
{"text":"This review is specific to Casbah's Piccola Gusto Menu. Amazing lunch.   There's outdoor seating that's covered by a canvas, eliciting a Moroccan vibe. Really great atmosphere. I've come dressed pretty casually with friends, yet you can come to Casbah for a more formal lunch.   The menu is a $17 two-course meal that's completely worth it. You start with your choice of a soup or salad. I always go with the Arugula salad which has pieces of potato, mushroom, pork belly (like bacon), and goat cheese. It's a heavier salad. Next, you get half sandwich and half pasta / risotto. My go-to is the crab cake sandwich. It's delicious. I usually change up the pasta, but my favorites are the Ricotta Cavatelli (tomato based), Short Rib Ravioli (can't go wrong with short rib), and Orecchiette Pasta (it's the goat cheese). Do not underestimate this deal; it's more filling than you think! Also complementary bread (dip in the pasta sauce)!!  There is valet parking, but it was complementary. So tip!"}
{"text":"Best gnudi I have ever eaten! Loved this place, the food is sublime, I even licked clean the small homemade butter that they serve with the bread. Definitely will try out this place again!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and my food is always amazing. I love coming here. The atmosphere is very comfortable and my food has always been excellent.  Unfortunately my bf's meals have been messed up both times. Last time we went was Valentine's Day and we waited about an hour for our meals and mine had been messed up and re-done, so it was taken off the bill, but my bf's came out cold and undercooked(it was pasta). We both agree that the flavor combinations are amazing and unique, but unfortunately the execution, mostly cooking, have ruined the meals for him at least.   I love this place and would love to return for special occasions but unfortunately at the price point and having had 2 bad experiences, my boyfriend doesn't want to return. I will likely return in the future on my own dime, but not for a special occasion because I don't want him to have a bad meal again.   I would recommend going here when you have time to spare. I have gotten a cheese and prosciutto plate, salads, and chicken dishes and everything was fine. My bf had an issue with pasta and beef dishes. If you're ordering a salad or cheese plate, go ahead and go for a special occasion(I can't see how those can be put together wrong), but if you're going for anything more, just make sure you have some spare time in case you need to send something back. The food and flavors are amazing and I would totally recommend giving it a try because when it's cooked right, it's wonderful.   Really hoping we just went during bad times because I would love to go here more often and I am sure it'll be difficult to get my bf to come along next time and if he does, I am sure he will not join me in ordering anything."}
{"text":"Stopped by in the afternoon for a quick bite to eat. The main dining room is closed in the afternoon before dinner between 2:30-5pm, but you can still order from a small menu at the bar. They were very friendly and accommodating. We tried the scallops and flatbread with hummus/baba ghanoush/red pepper muhummara, both were fantastic and well done. Would definitely go again to try something from their regular menu!"}
{"text":"If I could, I'd dock a half star after my second visit.  But I feel positively enough about my first meal there, that taking off a whole star seems harsh.    I got a free entree coupon for my birthday, for signing up for Big Burrito's mailing list, and decided to revisit Casbah.  The good: we got to enjoy the patio even though the weather was a little cool because it was heated.  My maccheretto, a pasta entree with white beans, sun-dried tomato, pesto and walnuts, was very good.  The pasta was al dente and the white beans were perfectly cooked (not mushy).  It was maybe a touch too salty (the fontina, maybe?), but I was happy with the choice.    Now, onto the weird.  After taking our orders, our waiter asked if we wanted bread with our big-calorie pasta dishes.  Checking if we want bread is fine--but, umm, he could have left out the comment about the pasta?  My friend and I are both twentysomething women.  Luckily, we're not that insecure about our bodies.  We like to eat.  Yes, bring the bread.  When he brought our entrees, he sang \"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you\" under his breath as he put my pasta in front of me.  I don't like people singing to me at restaurants, so I'm grateful it wasn't audible to everyone else on the patio--but a simple \"Happy birthday\" would have sufficed.  Then when he cleared our plates, he asked if my dish was \"everything [I] wanted, and more.\"  I appreciate the gestures, but it felt artificial.  He asked if we'd like to see the dessert menu--and added that he was supposed to ask that, that we shouldn't feel obligated.  Uh, what?  I think this and the bread/pasta comment bothered me the most.    To redeem the birthday coupon, you have to show an ID.  I recently cut my hair, so it's different than my license photo.  When he returned my ID to me, our waiter said, \"I like the short hair.\"  If this had been the only unusual statement he had made during the meal, I would have taken it as a compliment.  I guess it is one.  But when considered with all the other weird things, it just felt like he was trying way too hard and my friend and I both felt awkward.  The food here is good and I feel that the service this time was unusual, and the more professional service I had on my first visit here is closer to the norm.  I'd feel leery, though, if I were to have this particular server again."}
{"text":"Quick business trip to Pittsburgh. Thanks to you Yelp I found Casbah. Duck entree was to die for. Service is top quality. Highly recommended! Thanks Yelp! Thanks Casbah!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The name is a misnomer if you ask me. The food all seems to be Northern Italian although you can get hummus, etc. Service was great and the food excellent. My favorite thing to eat in the whole world is short ribs and they have short rib ravioli on the menu as a staple - not just for winter. So wonderful! We mentioned it was my birthday and they brought salted caramels with \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate sauce. Such a nice touch. I'll be back ASAP. I've found it very difficult to find truly great restaurants in Pittsburgh and this was a wonderful find."}
{"text":"I've only visited here once, but my visit left me completely unimpressed. I didn't hate it, but nothing stood out to me, except that my pasta dish was rather salty, and our server wasn't particularly attentive. I almost felt like he was annoyed by me and my companion--perhaps because we looked young?   I ordered the Orecchiette and she ordered the Short Rib Ravioli. Her dish was much better than mine--it was a well-balanced dish, but tiny. Mine just tasted of salty cheese with random bursts of tartness from the cranberries.   The decor has a nice airy, Mediterranean feel to it, but those kind of details carry very little weight for me, especially since I remember feeling extraordinarily hot and cramped.   I probably should give it another try, but I think I could only go if I were dragged there by enthusiastic friends... and I'll definitely have to stay away from the pasta."}
{"text":"Disappointing.   My bf and I went for JUST dessert and wine, which we told the hostess ahead of time. The waitress was very curt and disrespectful. We were rushed to order (even though there were plenty of empty tables and it was NOT closing time). She did not offer suggestions or advice.  We ended up ordering the flourless chocolate cake. The cake was extremely rich (but delicious!) and the portion was just right for sharing after dinner. The marscapone was silky and paired perfectly with the cherries on top.  The waitress kept coming back to see if we were done and ready for our check. After we got the check, she was in a hurry to get us out the door. I am completely dissatisfied with the service and will not go back to this restaurant simply because of it."}
{"text":"Casbah has made my Top 10 Favorite Restaurants in Pittsburgh list. My friends and I went here for one of my friend's birthday. The food was simple yet delicious and transported me back to Greece. Upon being seated, they offered complimentary bread with butter and mascarpone spread. The waiter was very knowledge about the menu and recommended his favorites which included the pork chop entree and that soft shell crabs and corn were in season. As a result, my friends and I shared the soft shell crab app. The soft shell crab was fried to perfection with a small side salad of sliced asparagus and basil with tapenade. The only complaint I had with this dish was that there was only one to share between the three of us.   For the entrees, I decided to heed the waiter's advice and selected the pork chop while my friends ordered the gnocchi and cioppino. What I am about to describe for the pork chop does not do it justice. The pork chop was cooked to the right temperature and did not lost its juiciness unlike most of my experiences with pork chop. It was also huge because it was double cut. The riscotto and braised kale complimented the pork chop well with the braised kale giving the pork chop an herbal component. I did not think I would be able to finish the dish but when I looked down again, everything was gone. I had the opportunity to try my friends' dishes and they were also prepared in an exceptional way. The veal and lobster in the gnocchi added a welcoming heartiness to the dish and the sauce reminded me of a curry. The unexpected combination of the gnocchi and curry-like sauce pleasantly surprised me. Since I have never tried cioppino until that day, I did not have anything to compare it but I was satisfied with the amount of seafood they gave. The only complaint from my friend was that the grilled bread that came with the dish was too hard for her to use to soak about the sauce. She used the complimentary bread instead and loved the sauce.  While we were ordering our dishes, we mentioned to our waiter that it was my friend's birthday. He brought out a dish of caramel with \"Happy Birthday\" written on it with dark chocolate sauce for her even though we didn't expect anything from them. I am grateful that they brought that dish out. I do not know if the caramel is on their menu but it melted right away in your mouth.   If you managed to read all the way to the end of this review, you probably are asking why I didn't give Casbah all five stars and I will tell you the reason. Although our waiter went above and beyond to get my friend a birthday \"plate\", the service overall was not satisfactory. Throughout the meal, he did not come over to our table and took a long time getting our checks to us even though we blatantly had finished our dinner for awhile. I have gone to less delicious restaurants who offer better service.  Overall, the food at Casbah is exceptional. They change their menu based on what is in season. Here's a tip: if you sign up for the Big Burrito emails (the parent company of Casbah at https://secure.bigburrito.com/Register.aspx), you will get a free meal voucher on your birthday which is good at any of their restaurants. When my parents come into town, I will be subtly hinting that they take me here."}
{"text":"Unbelievable good and atmosphere is phenomenal! Awful server but would definitely go back! The gnocchi is absolutely amazing. My fiancé got the farmhouse chicken and that definitely didn't disappoint either. Loved it so much we wanted to go back the following weekend. Great offer for your birthday too (they will send you a free entree if you sign up at big burrito)"}
{"text":"I ate here in January and was very impressed. We ate in the basement, although Casbah has two floors and outdoor seating. I thought the atmosphere was very good, and the fish (I forget the exact dish) was well-prepared.  This is on the expensive side, but worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"The food and service were both really good. The double cut pork chop was a LOT of meat proportionate to the rest of the meal. I couldn't finish it. I wish I had more risotto and braised kale because those was delicious. The scallops were cooked perfectly with a good crispy texture on top. The bread was great too with the sea salt butter and goat cheese spread. The one gripe I had was the parking not the food. Why charge for valet for the lot right next to the restaurant when it's 10 steps from the door?? Unnecessary expense for that lot. Why not just charge for the lot to park yourself there? I can understand if there is valet that parks somewhere else offsite, but I'm not going to pay to watch someone park my car."}
{"text":"Excellent prix fixe brunch with impressive service. One of the best brunch deals in Pittsburgh: two courses and a drink for under $30, and their selection has something for everyone.  I love their patio ambiance as well as their basement set-up. Great place to take visitors or for special occasions.  I'm a huge seafood person so the first time I ordered a Bloody Mary with the smoked salmon to start and sea scallop fry as my main.  I'm a fan of their Bloody, it's spicy and flavorful. The smoked salmon was filling enough that it's easy to split and the truffled potato cake served with it melts in your mouth. The sea scallop fry is everything you would expect, almost too much food, but no complaints.  My second trip to Casbah brunch, I went with my old favorite of the smoked salmon but split it with my friend who ordered the cheese plate. Also, I ordered the Braised Lamb & Eggs as my main based on friends' recommendations. It's honestly to die for. Rich and flavorful in the best way, attributed to the tarragon sauce and the slow roasted lamb, and easily their specialty. If you want to order something you can't get anywhere else, order this. It's very filling and rich, especially if you get a filling first course. Have only been here for brunch, and looking forward to trying their lunch/dinner!"}
{"text":"This is such a fabulous place.  Regardless of the occasion the food and the service are impeccable.  In Pittsburgh trying to find a restaurant that will fit everyone in your parties needs is difficult - Casbah is the spot.  My family had a birthday party for me here on Sunday.  Casbah was accommodating with a cake, with a loud bunch that constantly changed their order, and were extremely patient.  The food was outstanding, as per usual! I ordered the Elysian lamb which was delicious! Cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Pittsburgh for the last 10 years. I've eaten at Casbah dozens and dozens of times. In the past, it was, if not the best, then one of the top 2-3 restaurants in town.  Now, I've had several \"meh\" experiences here.  It's not just that I think the restaurant scene is stronger and more competitive (it is) but I think Casbah has declined some from their best. Maybe if it's your first time to the restaurant, the menu will be interesting and exciting. But it very rarely changes substantially. They claim to print the menus each day, but it would still be nice to get a highlight of \"oh, this is new\" - it seems to retain largely the same entrees.  My wife and I went last weekend for her birthday. The beet salad was fresh and tasty. I tried the tomato watermelon bisque, which sounded interesting but lacked something, somehow. I still can't put my finger on it - perhaps it was too smooth and there wasn't contrast?  I had the duck, which was excellent.  My wife had the swordfish with roasted greens. She made a face mid-way through the meal after she tasted the side, saying it was \"the most bitter, smoky and yet salty\" combination she could ever imagine. (I'll note that she's an adventurous eater, so that's quite a statement.)  What troubled us wasn't the dish - that happens sometimes. The waitress, to her credit, asked if they could do anything and ended up taking the entrée off the bill.  But overall, service was really meh. Nobody seemed to smile. There wasn't an \"oh, we're sorry, we hope you'll come again\" kind of statement. The waiter at the next table stepped on my foot - hard - without any apology as he seemed in a rush.  Look, if you've read this far, I'm clearly being picky. But if you go to Casbah, you want a special experience. It's supposed to be a top-notch restaurant. I've gone a few times in the last 2-3 years and we consistently haven't gotten \"special.\"  Good luck Casbah - I hope you get back to your peak."}
{"text":"We went to brunch on Sunday to celebrate my cousins wedding anniversary and it was absolutely lovely. We sat outside on their \"porch area\" and could not have had a better experience.   They offer a brunch menu that you choose an appetizer, entree and drink from for a reasonable price.   The meal was served with a basket of sweets, biscuits with honey butter, lemon poppyseed scones and chocolate chip muffins. The portions were extremely generous.   The service was incredible, nobody ever had an empty water glass. They were polite and courteous.   We tried the fried shrimp and calamari, the cheese tasting, the beat salad and the hummus. Everything was delicious. Our party had a large variety of entrees and everyone really enjoyed their meals. The drinks were whimsical and fun. We tried the seasonal mimosa and the sangria.   The atmosphere was pleasant, it was easy to have a conversation with our party. The place was clean and trendy.   They also offered complimentary parking which was so convenient."}
{"text":"Able to walk-in, table for 3 at 6PM on a Tuesday evening. Good thing we stopped by early, the place was *packed* by the time we left.  What I wish I knew before I walked in: the appetizer portions are generous, almost huge! For a light meal or small-portion eater, they are just right as an entree. I ordered the gnudi with mushrooms, spinach, walnuts and peccorino. Delectable 1\" bites filled with light, airy cheese (ricotta?). There were 4 or 5 gnudi, plenty of mushrooms, rich broth. Would be great with a soup or salad to make a meal.  Also to the table: steamed mussels- HUGE mussels, heaping huge portion; veal meatballs.   I got the roast chicken over oat risotto; the risotto was interesting, I liked the creamy texture, but it had been salt-bombed :( Chicken was nicely seared, skin on. But cold.  Also to the table: duck with cherries and the cioppinno. Thumbs up from both diners.  Service was excellent; 3 stars for the cold chicken and over-salted risotto"}
{"text":"Went here last night with a group of five. It was a wonderful evening. We were hopeful to sit out in the patio area but when we realized it was 90 degrees outside and patio was not really cooled down we opted for the inside area. We were actually seated downstairs (which I didn't know they have) and it was wonderful.   The Food. I had the gnocchi, with was absolutely delicious. Not too heavy and balanced out nicely with the fennel, asparagus and lobster. Someone else at our table had the pork chop and was very pleased. We all opted for dessert as well. My creme brûlée was wonderful and I appreciated the addition of some fresh strawberries, (instead of the usual raspberries) since they are in season. Everyone was very pleased with their meals.   My only side comment is the kitchen/bar seemed to be a bit slow. Our waitress was wonderful and on top of things. Filled up our water glasses as much as she could while we waited. We did have to inquire about our drinks because it just seemed to be taking a while and we didn't order any special cocktails. However, once we did get our drinks things were moving but just at a little bit overall slower pace. However, I actually appreciated that. We all settled in to enjoy our great wine, food and dessert. It was a great evening relaxing and enjoying sharing each other's company around the table."}
{"text":"The fodd was amazing. I had the salmon. Its a great place for a keto diet if you know what to order. However i recommend entering the building from the parking lot unless you want to feel like a spectical walking into the patio from the street. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"For our last lunch in Pittsburgh we decided to return to the Big Burrito Group; Eleven was quite good and both Gayot and Pittsburgh Magazine compared the experience at Casbah favorably to that of Big Burrito's crown jewel.  Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.  When our server, a young woman named Amanda L who would prove quite inept and inefficient from start to finish, finally did arrive our menus were delivered with a brief hello before she wandered away - another server later stopped by to fill our water and drinks were never even offered.  When Amanda finally did return she was capable of answering a couple questions about portion size and our orders were placed.  With my mom and sister opting for the two-course Gusto lunch and myself choosing two courses a la carte we sat and sipped our water.  Waiting approximately 10 minutes another ancillary server arrived with bread and butter - a light and airy white bread with a hefty crust paired with a sweet and salted cow's milk butter - decent, but nothing to write home about compared to the myriad bread options at Eleven.  After this point we would not see another staff member for 30 minutes...well, we would see them, they just wouldn't be walking anywhere near our table - instead bussing tables and running around while the hostess flirted with a man at the bar...I'll note that my water glass remained empty for greater than 15 minutes.  Finished with our first courses approximately 10 minutes would pass - long enough for me to actively collect each and every plate and stack them at the empty seat of our four-top - before Amanda would finally return to collect the dirty plates...we'd not see her again until 15 minutes later when she filled our water glasses and told us our main courses would be \"right out.\"  While I guess she didn't define \"right out,\" what this actually meant was \"in 25 minutes.\"  Starting first with my mother's combo - Jumbo Lump Crab, pepper bacon, avocado, radish sprouts, on a paesano bun and Orecchiette Pasta with grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream. While the sandwich may not be memorable, the pasta was actually quite impressive.  Using a less salty cheese and mild cream to flavor the al dente little ears of pasta worked wonders while the sweet/savory mélange of craisins and grilled chicken were a nice match.  Vastly less well done than my mother's plate would be my sister's option - the Grilled Vegetables, portobello, zucchini, eggplant, arugula, chickpea hummus, on baguette and Maccheretto pasta with wild mushrooms, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes, rapini pesto, fontina, walnuts.  Beginning with the sandwich, the bite I had was good in taste but rather mushy in consistency - too many similar vegetable textures and the hummus spread too thickly.  Moving on to the pasta - we all tasted it, but I'm still not sure what we were supposed to be tasting - it tasted like watery cheese...no spice, no salt, and certainly nothing resembling pesto or tomatoes.  For the first time in the meal Amanda actually opted to check on us approximately 10 minutes into our main courses and when told of the watery pasta she did apologize and offered to replace it with something else - more Orcchiette.  For my main course I received a simple side salad-fresh greens, crispy onion strings, and a pleasant vinaigrette.  The salad, of course, was served alongside Elysian Fields Lamb \"Mac and Cheese\", tubetti pasta, mascarpone, cheddar, Pecorino-Romano, and bread crumbs.  Piping hot and browned with crispy bread crumbs the dish was a decent Macaroni and Cheese, but honestly the lamb was so scarce and thinly cut that it added little.  Completing our mains approximately 110 minutes after entering Casbah we again waited nearly ten minutes before anyone would stop by to collect dirty plates-a different ancillary server this time.  With my mother and sister already deciding enough was enough they stood up to use the restroom before leaving-by the time Amanda would stop by to ask if anyone would care for dessert our two course meal had lasted 2:05 and I skipped on a menu entailing bread pudding, carrot cake, and panna cotta with \"just the bill.\"  Settling the bill via credit card no tip was left because no tip was deserved - in reality Amanda may have actually be the worst server I've encountered at a fine dining establishment in the last 2 years.  I will note that when I wrote to Big Burrito was met by a (seemingly) sincere apology without excuses - the Manager stated things don't' normally happen like that and he'd be sure the issue was addressed.  He closed with \"I hope you will join us again.\" I will not."}
{"text":"Casbah was alright, but nothing really popped. Had the bruchetta which was a overly creamy and sweet, without enough of an acidic element to cut through the creaminess. The tuna tartare was acceptable rather one note, tuna itself was too unimpressive on its own for such an unadulterated plating. the goats milk gnutti were legitimately good, the best part of the meal really, had a lot of flavors playing off each other very well. The scallop/crab pasta entree was good, but the noodles in mine were a bit more toothsome than al dente. The sauce was lacking depth of flavor. The scallops were very well cooked, but they were just good scallops, just what any chef should be able to do really. The Chilean seabass was not anything special, sauce lacked depth. The vegetable salad with it was neat, especially the radishes, which lost their strong peppery element in a good way.   In all, Casbah was a disappointment. Its a high dining Mediterranean place, but accomplishes neither very well. If I really hadn't been exposed to some of the good places to eat in Pittsburgh and elsewhere, I might be more impressed. But alas, my standards are admittedly high. But honestly, for the money, there are better places to go.  Also, if the owner happens to read this, your gas radiant heaters in the front dining area are ducted wrong. Your air intake is pulling from the dining area, which creates a cold draft coming from the outside walls/windows. You need to have someone duct your intake air to the outside to prevent this, it will make the room much more comfortable and save you money on heating."}
{"text":"I went to Casbah for the first time a couple years ago and remembered not being too happy with my experience. I decided to give it another shot, and I'm very happy with my decision to do so.   Last night I arrived to Casbah around 9:15. The kitchen closes at 10:00 so we were fine. The male at the host stand seemed pretty irritated that we were just arriving but it wasn't like I was walking in at 9:55. We opted to sit inside because it was a little chilly. He the two of us down at a table against the wall in the very back. It was tiny and cramped and not too mention very poor lighting. Almost felt like I was punished to that table? So I asked our server to be moved to another table in the restaurant.   We served some bread and sea salt butter. In my opinion, the bread was nothing special. I had a few bites and didn't finish much just because I wanted to save room for the more important dishes. We were also served some type of Greek yogurt for the bread but that combination didn't sound appetizing to me.   I ordered a 3 cheese selection option as an appetizer. I regret it a little bit now just because I was served the same bread. I added the prosciutto for an extra $4 and it was very good. I picked the first 3 cheeses on the menu (forget exactly what they were). I would have like the server to tell me which cheese was which, but I enjoyed them nonetheless.   In addition I also had the Charred Spanish rock octopus which was the highlight of the entire meal. I highly recommend it.   I had the Casbah (signature, as I was told) double-cut pork chop. This cut was very large and I ended up taking most of it to go. The rice was phenomenal, especially the rice that was under the meat. It had absorbed the flavors from the meat.   Finally, I decided on the pistachio cannoli. I had a tough time deciding between that and the chocolate pot de creme. The flavor seemed to be a little off and I think i would have like the filling to be a bit sweeter.  I also opted for the Greek dessert wine pairing, which they only able to serve me half a glass because they ran out. It ended up being free, so I didn't mind.   My server was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to explain things very clearly. However, I HATE when servers go take a smoke break and then leave my table smelling like an ashtray. Off putting as I was eating my cannoli dessert.   Pretty good experience, but could have been amazing."}
{"text":"In my mind, Casbah is one of the best restaurants in Shadyside. The atmosphere is the restaurant makes you feel as though you are in a restaurant on the Mediterranean. They have a covered patio and a indoor portion - both leaving you with a relaxed vibe.   Some of my personal favorite items from the menu include the Duck Confit Gnocchi, the Pork Chop and the Risotto. The dinner dishes range from $20-$40. The restaurant also has a fabulous Sunday Brunch-reservations for this are highly recommended.   The wait staff is extremely knowledge about the food and drinks that the restaurant offers and also very friendly. I have never had a bad experience!   This is a great restaurant for a date or for a celebration. Insider Tip: Sign up for the Big Burrito Group Birthday Club and receive $30 off of your meal during your birthday month!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ended up coming here because of a birthday coupon from the Big Burrito company. Anyway we came in on a chilly night so I was dead set to be seated in the inside area (not the tented part, despite this area being comfortably warm). Anyway we were promptly seated and decided to order some wine and had a hummus dip as an appetizer.  The hummus was pretty good, but their flat bread was just awesome. It was chick pea based and was really crispy and had this amazing flavor. We were also provided with their bread, which was also quite tasty on it's own, but it was elevated by their butter and another yogurt based dip with was damn good.   Anyway, I ended up ordering the lamb shank, and my husband ordered the pork chop.  The lamb shank was incredibly tender and very, very flavorful. It also had a bit of freshness added with apples, cherries and some squash. It was quite enjoyable and it was so much food! I also had a taste of my husband's pork chop which was very tasty as well. Pork chop can be tricky to cook, because it can get dried out, but this pork chop was delicious and moist. It sat on this prosciutto and Parmesan risotto that was incredible.    Overall our experience was awesome. The service was great, the food came at a timely manner and to top it off I got some of their home made salted caramels for dessert on the house. Casbah, you get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight at the bar.  My sister and I wore sweatpants and flip flops... Nobody treated us differently .. The brought out bread with butter and a second butter made from goat milk.. I liked it .. My sister said it reminded her of cream cheese.. We shared the calamari ... It was good... I had the halibut... It was good accompanied with a salad.. My sister had the duck.. I didn't like the duck that much but I am not a big fan of duck to begin with .. We each had wine ... I had the falanghina .. It was perfect.. We shared a bread pudding for dessert.. It was the first time I ever had bread pudding... It like it .. It is a nice quiet restaurant with ample seating both inside and outside..."}
{"text":"My meal was so tasty.  Both my wife and I enjoyed our meals immensely.  It was a busy Saturday night and the place was packed.  It took some time to get to our table which was fine because we enjoyed the bar.   We had dessert which was okay, nothing special - compared to the mains.  We would have had another glass of wine but no one came by to ask.  We sat and talked with our friends but, alas, we got thirsty and left.  Appetizers and mains were really incredible.  Then again, maybe we were joyous being sans kids?"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Casbah on our first date night after having our son. Our plan was to take our time and indulge in everything. After we looked through both the wine selection (outstanding) and the menu (delicious), we decided to do things a little differently. Instead of ordering just two entrees, we wanted to sample as many libations and treats as possible.  First, we ordered the white wine flight, and split a few seafood appetizers; then, we ordered the red wine flight, and split a few meaty appetizers; and, finally, we each ordered a glass of our favorite red and split a chocolate ravioli with raspberry sauce dessert.   Our bill was quite pricey, but I feel totally worth it. Every single thing we drank and ate was delicate, perfect, satisfying, and well balanced. I would go back and spend the money any time!"}
{"text":"We decided to give brunch a try for our first visit to Casbah.  We were surprised  by the huge tent covering the \"outdoor\" dining area.  We opted for an inside table, the interior is somewhat small the tables are close together.  For brunch, you are served your choice of drink, appetizer and entree.    For our drinks, BJ had a Bloody Mary and I had a Bellini.  We were served a basket of yummie bread and mini muffins.  For appetizers, we got a Three Sisters Farms mesclun greens and smoked salmon and truffled potato cake.  Very good.  For entrees we selected a jumbo lump crab & tomato omelet and the NY strip steak.  Very relaxing and tasty meal."}
{"text":"I was treated to Casbah for lunch by a potential employer who had passed me over, but really, really liked me. She said it was her favorite restaurant, but that she didn't go as often as she'd like.  I knew the building from the early 80's when it had been one of Pittsburgh's dive gay bars called 'The Tender Trap', and knowing this, as well as a lot about the Big Bistroid Group...oops...Big BURRITO Group, I was curious to try it out and see if it lived up to the usual Big Burrito hype.  And voila, indeed, it's another excruciatingly overpriced bistroid in da burgh.  The atmosphere is actually quite lovely, inside or out. The colors are comfortable, the noise levels subtle, the seating comfortable, and the service staff looks professional (YOUNG) with no Coney Island side show appearances.  The service was good. Not overly friendly, but not uppity like young people waiting tables in more upscale restaurants tend to be in da bugh.  The menu was short, but did have a list of pretty unique offerings.  My friend had a salmon salad, and I opted to try the Farm Lamb Mac-n-Cheese.  The waiter brought a small basket with bread to the table accompanied by a single medium sized pat of salted butter to spread.  For a beverage, we both opted for just water.  I have to say, if I actually had to pay for this, I would have been pretty miffed.    For LUNCH, the prices were all around the $15 range, and the portions were NOT large.  The portions were actually fine for lunch, not overly filling (by any stretch of the imagination), but they didn't leave you hungry.  I can't speak for the salmon, as I have NEVER had salmon in any form other than lox that didn't taste like a dried sawdust version of some strong fish. She seemed to enjoy it very much, so there it is.  The Farm Lamb mac n cheese was tasty. The lamb was tender and moist, and the mac n cheese was a tiny tube pasta with a very nice creamy cheesy sauce, all topped with a bread crumb covering when it was broiled until crispy.  It was accompanied by a 'pinch' of mesclun salad topped with another pinch of fried onions.  Basically - take one large spoonful of mac n cheese with a higher end cheese sauce and a fancier noodle than comes in the average box - mix in about four cubes of roast lamb, sprinkle on a layer of bread crumbs and toss it in the broiler until the crumbs are toasted - then using your index finger and thumb, pick up a pinch of mesclun and sit it on the plate next to the mac n cheese bowl - and you have a bistroid expensive art project on a plate.  Seriously? $15 for lunch? It's mac n cheese people!  I also have to call into question the name and theme.  Mad Mex is bistroid Tex Mex.  Soba is bistroid Asian.  Kaya is bistroid Caribbean-ish.  Casbah? Farm Lamb mac n cheese? Sure, I can see this as a box lunch while riding a camel through the desert...not.  I can't say the experience was awful. The company was awesome, and we had a nice unpressured amount of time for fun chat.  The atmosphere was comfortable, and the food was tasty.  But was it all worthy of a return trip or recommendation?  I honestly can't say 'yes' with any kind of cheerleader rave.    I'm not quite sure that I comprehend the mindset of people in this burgh who think paying that kind of money for food is worth it, when honestly, food with just as much flavor can be found in abundance around town for half the price and twice the portion.   Who are all of these easily dupe-able rich people, and where do they come from? Want to blow that kind of money? Get out your check book and let me give you my address!"}
{"text":"casbah is the last big burrito restaurant i had left to try and i really liked it. i started with the sangria to drink which was delicious, and i'm usually not a huge fan of sweet drinks like that. we split the grilled flatbread app. the dips weren't anything super special, but the bread was thick and flavorful. no complaints. then we both got piccola gusta and split all our items. (the piccola gusta gives you salad or soup, half a sandwich, and half a pasta) between the two of us we had the tomato & basil bisque, arugula salad, crab cake sandwich, salumi sandwich, orecchiette pasta, and ricotta cavatelli. i'm not a big fan of tomato soup, in fact, i never eat it, but i tried the bisque and loved it. it tasted more like a tomato sauce than soup. the arugula salad was great as well. the crab cake sandwich was really small but good, and the salumi sandwich was amazing... probably my favorite part of the meal. both pastas were good, but i personally preferred the orecchiette, the cranberries sealed the deal for me. i love the atmosphere, we sat out on the covered patio, and the service was great as well. i'll definitely be back again, hopefully to try the different brunch and dinner menus!"}
{"text":"Casbah is pricey.  I don't mind paying for a nice dinner once in awhile but if you're going to charge that much then you really need to deliver on the food and experience.  I do like that they took reservations via opentable.    The restaurant itself was cute.  Half indoors and half outdoors with heat lamps.  The staff was attentive and helpful when it came to splitting the bill and items we shared.    The food, however, was alright.  I was with a table of 5 and we each ordered different items.  The only person that loved her food ordered a veggie pasta.  For the prices I expected the food to be spectacular.... but for the food we got they should easily knock off $10 each item.  Also, the portions aren't huge.  This isn't a bad thing but don't think because you're paying $30 a plate that you're going to get an overabundant plate of food.  As someone stated previously the best part was the bread.  I don't plan on returning.  There are better tasting places in Pittsburgh that don't charge as much as Casbah."}
{"text":"Overpriced, salty and overrated!!! Why this place is so popular I will never understand."}
{"text":"We arrived late in the evening and had to ask our waiter about the \"pasta festival,\" which he mentioned.  It turned out that both pastas, the salad, the calamari, the cocktails, and the service were good.   Casbah would have been livelier earlier and more pleasant without a loud and persistent talker in the party of 6 at the next table.   I'd definitely return for the food and service."}
{"text":"I thought their brunch was really great.  We sat in their heated patio area.  I ate from their prix-fixe brunch, which for a reasonable price (compared to what I get in Nashville) offers an alcoholic beverage (think Salty Dog, Bloody Mary, Mimosa), an appetizer, and a main dish.  The service was alright; we had a big group and could have used more refills, but only solution would have been to add another server probably.  I loved their brunch polenta!  It was like grits/oatmeal meets polenta, with spices and dried fruit in an oatmeal sort of pairing.  The breakfast was just really delicious overall, and I pretty much ate everything put in front of me.  Only two dings from me...  The heater in the patio area showered a bit of ash on my husband (probably dust burnoff) and smudged the table.  But his food was spared, so no harm done.  Their valet was also a bit slow, probably needed another body to assist.  It's great they had a multi-course brunch menu, and I'd love to come back to taste their dinner offering."}
{"text":"I recommend the short rib ravioli! Totally the best thing I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Big Burrito does it again! Casbah is located on a wonderful, neighborhood street in the Shadyside area of Pittsburgh. We got there a little early and waited a little in the lot. Our reservation was for 11 and they open at 11. We were still told the valet had to move our car. I get they have a way they do things and it must work for them but the lot has about 40 spaces that you can see from the street so I don't know why valet is necessary. We are particular about our vehicles and we don't valet anywhere. Not that the valets weren't nice and it's not like we could not see them move the car but anyway...the main reason they get a 4 and not a 5 star. Onto the meal...  We waited just a few minutes in line to be seated. As I said our reservation was at 11 & that is when they open. We were seated promptly requesting the inside area of their dining room. They do have a very nice, shaded patio area as well complete with ceiling fans. We requested to sit inside and the hostess happily obliged. We were greeted quickly by a happy and knowledgeable waitress who was on it. She was not at all intrusive but our water was never empty and we didn't have to wait long for our check when we were done. She asked if we wanted any other beverage. I got an iced tea and the hubby requested iced coffee. The waitress noted they could make one for him by adding ice to coffee and he said yes. He was very happy they would accommodate his request.   We ordered our food and were promptly brought a basket of bread (oh the wonderful bread basket!). We got 3 types of amazing breadly goodness that included cranberry scones (wow), biscuits (warm, soft, & the Hubby's favorite), and (my favorite) the lime, coconut muffin (sweet, lime, coconut, what's not to love). Oh, and let us not forget the maple butter, yum! I ordered the smoked salmon app. The combo of salmon, capers, aioli, and truffled potato cake - absolute perfection! There was a salty, smokey, sweet flavor that was sheer joy on my taste buds. The hubby chose the creamy polenta which he thoroughly enjoyed noting it was very oatmeal like. For my entree it was the sea scallop fry minus the caramelized onions. I would SOOOO get this again! The scallops were cooked to perfection with a wonderful golden outside that makes my heart sing with joy (can you tell I love a good sea scallop?). The combo of English peas, fennel sausage, and white corn grits...it was something special for sure! I could eat that sausage by the boat load every single day! And the grits - smooth, creamy, and perfectly seasoned. Not that it needed it but the dish comes with scrambled eggs and a beautifully, buttery croissant. My brunch was so satisfying, Heaven! The hubby chose the eggs Benedict with prosciutto. He liked it but noted he should have gotten the spinach not the prosciutto. He said the prosciutto seemed vinagary. The dish includes paprika roasted fingerling potatoes which were mild and perfectly cooked. And for dessert we chose the chocolate stout cake on a wine caramel drizzle served with a little dish of creme brulee ice cream. Holy cow! What a terrific chocolate cake & the ice cream rocked too.   Overall, I would recommend Casbah to everyone noting their brunch was fabulous! The valet (even though the need for valet is questionable) and wait staff were super nice, attentive, & knowledgeable. The apps, brunch, & dessert were yummy and delightful. We will visit again!"}
{"text":"While I have always had a great experience with my food, I feel the need to update my prior review based on my experience at brunch today.    When my food came out, there was a very visible hair on my plate. I was with a large group and did not want to make a scene, so I mentioned it to the server who immediately took my plate away. The manager on duty came out to apologize, which I did appreciate. However, I was a little surprised because when they brought my plate out about 5 minutes later, I could tell that it was the same exact plate.   First off, it was not even warm, so if they made my meal on the spot you would think it would be hot, or at the very least warm. I had also substituted bacon for the sausage that normally comes with the entree, and if the chef had made a new plate on the spot, he would probably have sent it out with the sausage (or with a side of bacon again), which he did not (they had served my bacon on the side when they brought it out initially).     Everything was in the exact same place on the plate. I wasn't going to cause a scene, so I pretended to enjoy it, but did not. I was quite repulsed.  in my last review I had said that Casbah was my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had mentioned that the Cassericia dish was my favorite but that they had removed it from the menu the last time I tried to order it there for dinner. I received a response from someone at the restaurant that she was not sure why I would think that because it is still offered, and I explained that the waiter told me it was removed from the menu.   I'm not really sure what happened here, but I can tell you this... I don't think that Casbah is my favorite anymore. In fact not only is it not my favorite, it has taken a plunge to the bottom of my list of places to eat.   For me, if you expect to eat at a top restaurant, the service should be top of the line, and it has just been too inconsistent for my taste. No thanks Casbah!"}
{"text":"We were excited to go to casbah after hearing good things from locals and having gone to mad Mex, which was truly great TexMex food. despite trying to be optimistic, we really left unimpressed. here's the breakdown: cocktails/drinks- the list was unimaginative and wife's cocktail was neither refreshing, not very strong. the beers offered were not great, one was flat: 3/10 gnuti- this was somewhat tasty and rich, with well cooked chunks of lobster, however nothing I'll remember tomorrow: 7/10 octopus- the list of ingredients and fact that it is a Mediterranean restaurant makes you think this would be light and fresh w a salty kick from the prosciutto. but it seemed to be cooked with the prosciutto and/or brown sugar and was overcooked, a heavy lumbering dish that not even fennel could make up for. this was a big disappointment. 2/10 halibut-  the fish was well cooked, but the dish was generic, not exciting nor offensive, forgettable. 4/10 Casericcha (sp?)- this really was the standout. The scallops were cooked well and it was chock full of crab. It was very rich. Nothing about the preparation was special, and it wasnt spicy and it was green with pesto so the name red pepper is somewhat of a misnomer, but for the pure weight of fresh lump crab makes this dish 8/10, even with a pretty high price for pasta of $35. Dessert- milk sponge cake- small and fairly dry, which again, with name \"sponge\" one would be disappointed to expect a moist cake. 3/10. service- the service was fine, not amazing, seemed like waiter was a little too busy for the higher prices of food. although the ambience on porch was nice, they seemed to have a hard time regulating the temperature, with various times of sweat building on the brow, throughout the meal. 5/10 total: 30/7=4.something and given the price, how good everything looked on the menu and the disappointment of anticipated greatness, I'm rounding down.  big burrito is a shooting 50% (props to mad Mex), curious to see how they do in the rubber match."}
{"text":"I finally went to Casbah for brunch today. Rolled in at 10am to meet a handful of people. Because it is Labor Day weekend, the place was empty except for a woman who had just gotten there too which was nice because a friend had warned me that the place gets crazy. We sat outside and atmosphere was cozy under the tent with the warm colors of the decor. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and presented us with the menus. I think it is great they have a prix fixe brunch - 1 alchy or nonalchy drink, an appetizer and an entree - but for $24. It looks like they have since raised the prices since Miles O. went. I felt it was just a tad steep and a lot of food but took the plunge anyway. I ordered the smoked salmon for the appetizer and the mushroom omlette for my entree, and had a hot coffee (they did not have ice coffee though offered to put ice with hot coffee if I wanted it). The waitress brought out some delicious mini baked treats before we got our dishes - poppy scone (on the crispier side but delicious), blueberry muffins and biscuits, which were all buttery goodness. After eating these I was getting a little full and then after my appetizer I realized I probably should not have gotten the prix fixe but could have would have should have. I ended up boxing half of my omlette entree. Portions were large, atmosphere was cool, food was good and wait staff were awesome but in the end I don't think $24 (not including the tip and tax) was worth it."}
{"text":"The brunch prefix menu is a good value - $24 including an appetizer, a main dish, and a drink. The appetizer and the drink were very nice, but the main dish was too heavy for a brunch I think (I ordered the lamb). Overall it's good and I'm glad we finally went there after hearing good words about it for 2 years."}
{"text":"I've been to Casbah several times now and each dinner experience has been even better than the last. I have tried several pastas, seafood, and meat dishes and not a single one has ever disappointed.  The aspect of Casbah that I feel sets it apart from even the other Big Burrito restaurants is its quality of service.  They are extremely polite, knowledgeable, and hard-working!"}
{"text":"I came to Casbah with my sister and another Bridesmaid for a Bachelorette dinner August 5th. We had reservations ay 6 and were able to walk in and get seated at a nice indoor table right away. The hostess did offer us outdoor seating on their beautiful patio, but we declined due to the weather.  I had viewed the menu a few days prior and thought it looked like a high quality Mediterranean restaurant. We were especially exciting for the cheese tasting and wine list.  Our table ordered a bottle of wine (Valdisanti Tolaini) which was fabulous and around $80-$90 if my memory serves me right. The waitress was prepared to do the proper wine presentation however as an ex-server, I told her not to worry about it. No stars were docked for this!  We ordered the cheese plate, meatballs and arugula salad to start. We were also served fabulous bread with salted butter and lebanese cheese spread. The cheese plate was perfect but the meatballs and arugula salad were dismal.  The arugula salad was the worst salad I have ever had. The arugula was wilted and flavorless. The dressing was flavorless. The different toppings were flavorless and contributed very little texture, especially the pancetta. The meatballs were just flavorless as well.  For our entrees, we ordered the lamb and a creamy sage pasta dish. Again, all of this was flavorless and unremarkable.   We decided to chance dessert and each ordered our own. My sister ordered a sponge cake, the other bridesmaid ordered the pot de creme, and I ordered to creme brulee. The creme brulee was executed well, but the sponge cake was flavorless and dry. The pot-de-creme was such an off consistency, more like rubber cement than a pot-de-creme.  Overall I spent around $300 and felt incredibly disappointed. I must admit I am from Los Angeles and am used to the high quality food here. Not many Angelenos go to Pittsburgh as a tourist destination. If this is the type of food the better restaurants can muster up, I won't be back either.  Casbah, you tried. But you cannot execute your dishes. Your recipes are off. You prices are high considering the region and quality. BUT  your restaurant is beautiful and your service is excellent. Thank you for a nice dinner, albeit with disappointing food."}
{"text":"After a few misses in Pittsburgh, Casbah came through. Most of the dishes were pretty good, though I think the pork chops are the best. My pasta was very good - great savory and flavorful sauce. Portions were large too. If you're in town and need a solid place to go, Casbah is a great pick."}
{"text":"The food at Casbah was incredible! From the cheese tasting, the meatballs, and the charred octopus to the lamb shank everything was delicious! The outdoor atmosphere is so cool. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service was a little iffy. Spilled some drinks and a little slow. Not a big deal, but I can't give 4.5 stars so 4 will have to do. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, but very expensive! My wife ordered the pork chop which was very tender an delicious! I had the duck. It wasnot as good as the pork chop but still delicious. A great place for special occasions."}
{"text":"Have I mention I LOVE the Big Burrito group? All I did was confirm that I still wanted to be subscribed to their email list and they sent me a free lunch entree for responding. I decided to use this coupon to try one of their restaurants that I haven't yet. YUM. I decided to go with the Piccola Gusta option, so that I could try a bit of everything. I went with the arugula salad, gnocchi and sword fish sandwich. It was all outstanding. Unfortunately there was a large dark hair in my salad that I noticed immediately (thank goodness) and our waiter took care of it promptly. A lot of times I would let that ruin my experience but I tried very hard to not let it. Anyway, finished the meal with the carrot gob. Again, yum!! Our service after that was just okay. He seemed to kind of forget about us? It was a bit odd. At one point we had no forks for a while with entrees in front of us. I guess I always expect something a little more as far as service when something like a hair accident happens. The food makes this place hands down as long as there isn't hair in it! We sat in the covered indoor porch area which was cute for lunch, but honestly seemed as though they segregated people by their appearance in who sat inside when going in to use the restroom.  Once they work on their service Casbah could easily be 5 stars. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Casbah. Meals and service are deliciously consistent, yet there's enough experimentation to keep things interesting. My dad and I visited this week, specifically, for Pastafest and - as usual - the meal was nothing short of spectacular.   We began at the bar where I mentioned a favorite drink no longer on the menu: the Malbec margarita. The bartender was quick to dig out the recipe box and whip one up to sweet and sour perfection. Happy hour prices make a stop at this bar one Shadyside's best options for higher end post-work cocktails.   Seated in the bright (though slightly stuffy patio), we began with Casbah's exceptional calamari. Lightly breaded and fried, the squid was tender and deliciously sauced with a garlicky aioli and the sweet and sour Italian agrodolce (ahhhmazzzing), the combination made for a crave-worthy bite.   Pastafest provided tasting portions of some old favorites and chef's creations. We shared three:   Gemelli, jumbo lump crab, sweet corn, guanciale, tarragon: sweet and bright, this dish was summer on a plate.    Doppio Ravioli, eggplant puree, goat cheese, sweet & spicy peppers, marinated fennel: creamy and rich, the sweet and spicy pepper sauce was just the acidic kick the ravoli needed to balance perfectly.    Sheep's Milk Gnudi, pork ragôut, baby kale, grilled scallions, orange sea salt, extra virgin olive oil: gnudi is an all-time favorite and the pork ragout was incredibly tender, a gussied up version of BBQ and pasta salad.  We ended our meal with the milk cake which was moist and sweet and lovely with the last few sips of wine. The thing about Casbah? I always leave wanting more, which always keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Hard to remember another restaurant that hit home runs from start to finish.  Yinzes say it's pricey but I disagree, the quality is hard to find period.  Very progressive menu but not too wild, products are from near area farms, very knowledgable staff.  And butter served at the right temperature, that's a novel idea!  Just a great experience, can't wait to get back there."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fresh locally sourced, great service. Had the gnoodi and it was to die for. Ramps, morels, English peas- omg! At the table we had the salmon, braised short rib ravioli and pappardelle - all fantastic. Would come back again if in the area!"}
{"text":"I am so happy they got rid of those awful bar stools!!!   We often choose not to walk in to Casbah without a reservation because the bar area was historically uncomfortable.  They have traded out the old stools that were screwed in to the floor, too far from your companions, and didn't comfortably turn to face people (who thought that was a good idea?) in for some admittedly less attractive but functional chairs,  I'm a big fan of the lunch and dinner there--we'll add that more often to our walk-in list now,"}
{"text":"Casbah continues to be my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant. High quality service and creative dishes. Sign up for mailers for Big Burrito special offers and birthday discount.    Must try: Calamari Cheese plate Short Rib Ravioli Pork Chop Watermelon Gin Fizz"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with my boyfriend to use my $30 birthday coupon. Everything, from the service to the atmosphere to the food, was wonderful.   We started out with the calamari and baba ganoush as our appetizers. The calamari had a really yummy sauce and was cooked perfectly, and the baba ganoush was definitely some of the best I've had. They also brought out freshly baked bread with some delicious homemade butter.   For our entrees, I had the red pepper casereccia and my boyfriend had the salmon. Both were absolutely amazing - the salmon was cooked perfectly. We both agreed that my pasta was the star though. The pasta and seafood were fresh and the sauce was delicious as well. Would definitely recommend this dish!   We were too stuffed for dessert, but they were nice enough to bring out some birthday cookies. Overall, Casbah was a great experience and I would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I came to Casbah to take advantage of my Big Burrito birthday entree and boy, was it delicious!   We started off dinner with the octopus appetizer, which was really different - the meat itself was almost caramelized. We also tried the baba ghanoush and the eggplant dip, which came with a flat bread. For entrees, we shared the scallops with small homemade pasta (so good!) and they even split it into two plates for us. Service was wonderful and patient - when we got dessert (butterscotch pot de creme) they wrote happy birthday around the plate. It's the little things that count!  I've also been here for lunch, where you can pick two items as a set. I had an arugula salad and the duck confit gnocchi with was on point. I really like Casbah for the service, great food and wine options. It's probably my favorite Big Burrito restaurant."}
{"text":"Such an intimate atmosphere, everyone dresses pretty fancy. Me and my boyfriend came here for his big burrito free birthday dinner. It was my first time here, and I really enjoy the experience. I saw so many reviews about their bread, and it was indeed delicious. They made special butter to go with the bread, they gave us salted caramel and pumpkin butter flavor. I personally love the salted caramel one.  We got the calamari dish to share as an appetizer. we finished it so quickly, it was freaking delicious! For entree, my boyfriend got scallop and crab pasta, he loves it. I got their duck with gnocchi as entree, I absolutely love it! I was hesitating on getting this, because I got the duck with gnocchi in soba and I did not like it. However, the waiter told me they're made very differently. I gave it a shot and loved it! The only thing I had to say is we waited a lonnnnnng time for our meals to come, it might be because of my roasted duck. Everything else, I have zero complaint. I would definitely come back again at some special occasion. I would love to try more dishes here."}
{"text":"Oh I love this place.  It has a great menu and wine list.  It has all the great dishes with a touch of flare.  I took this meal to seafood town from start to finish and have no regrets.  The staff was really friendly - realized I was there for a special occasion and brought out a desert that said congratulations - the little things.  We dined outside and I felt tucked away in a Europe-esque atmosphere for a few hours.  It is worth reserving a spot on the patio to get the full experience."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here last night. From the calamari app to salad soup dessert it was wonderful. There were 5 of us we sat in the front area. Service was wonderful as was Brianna who made it all special. Thank you Casbah and staff for a lovely night."}
{"text":"I like lunching at Casbah. The cheese tasting and tomato basil bisque are so good. If I could have them every day I'd be thrilled."}
{"text":"Unbelievable recommendation  of the house specialty by a awesome waiter, Adam, for the pork chop.... simply the best I ever had..... seriously worth driving from NJ for another plate"}
{"text":"Went here for drinks with some friends.    The bar service was definitely interesting.  Some of the time the waitress was really on point and was there ready to take your drink orders, but after the first drink it was really hard to get a second.   I can't speak for the food, but will update my review when I get back to try the food.  Overall my dirty martini was good, though it definitely could have used some better quality olives (these were bottled with the red pepper on the inside used on salads).  I will definitely be back to try the food, but I hope the table service is better than the bar service."}
{"text":"At this time, I have officially had every meal of the day at Casbah (it's great!). Here are my thoughts from my three visits:  First time was for dinner (June 2014) with my Big Burrito Birthday Coupon. We sat outside, where it was pleasant even though it was the middle of the summer. They were generous with the table bread and I really liked their goat cheese yogurt spread. I got the Orrechiette chicken pasta and BF got the filet mignon. The pasta was ok (see lunch review for update) and came in a large portion. The filet mignon was perfection. I made BF share with me :) The roasted potatoes with the green chutney were also heavenly. Definitely a lovely way to spend my birthday.  Second time was for a weekday lunch with a college friend visiting (Nov 2014). We had the 2 $10 off entree coupons and ordered off the Gusto menu (a fancy version of Panera's You Pick Two). I got the Orrechiette again and a Turkey Avacado Sandwhich. The pasta was delicious this time, so I'm thinking it was just one-uped by the Filet Mignon at dinner. Friend got the vege risotto which she liked. I like that Casbah is willing to customize plates at no extra charge or nuisance - they removed all bacon items from my entire meal and replaced them with other dressings, etc. I really appreciated that. Even without the coupon the Gusto lunch menu is a great deal!  Third time I went for brunch with another girlfriend (Dec 2014) . I LOVE BRUNCH and Casbah took the cake. The table scones, pastries etc were delicious as was the accompanying cinnamon butter. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and was again quick to help customize my vegetarian friend's needs. I got the Mimosa which was delicious. Smoked salmon appetizer was as good as the other yelpers say and the portion was humongous. Finally, I got the scallop omelette and they had no issue giving me my favorite home fries as the side instead of the grits. Friend got the salad appetizer and the spinach eggs benedict. She loved the eggs not such a big fan of the arugula salad (which I have had and liked). We each had a $10 off brunch which made this a steal :) We were able to sit outside even in the winter which was nice.  All in all, I love Casbah. I'm a student so it's a little expensive for me. But I go every chance I get. Look out for Big Burrito coupons!"}
{"text":"It is DUE time to update this review. Why? Because I had a phenomenal brunch here, and it totally restored my faith in not only Casbah, but Big Burrito. I can't lie, I love what the Big Burrito group does. I think all their restaurants are awesome, but Casbah was always my least favorite. Now, I feel it is on par with the others!  I love a good prix fixe brunch, and for $28 you receive a cocktail, appetizer and entree. So I started off with a mimosa (always a good start!). Then I ordered the Tomato & Basil Bisque and parmesan crostini, which was excellent. I'm very judgmental of tomato bisque, as it is one of my favorite soups.   Then came the main course. Braised Lamb & Eggs: braised Elysian Fields Farm lamb shoulder, spinach, poached local eggs, tarragon, grilled sourdough. I love lamb so hard. It's by far my favorite meat, but it has to be cooked with care. This definitely had flavor, was tender and paired perfectly with the spinach and eggs.   I couldn't finish my meal, so they boxed it up. I separated the sourdough and the rest of the dish so the bread wouldn't get soggy, and our server gave it to me without the sourdough. I mentioned I did that on purpose and he immediately went back into the kitchen and got me fresh bread. How nice is that?  Now I'm excited to try other meals here again!"}
{"text":"I'm actually giving it 3.5 stars.  3 for the appetizers and 4 for the entrees.  My wife and I went to Casbah for the first time.  As we usually do, we decided to share our entrees (TIP - you can get half portion sizes of the pastas!!) and augment the meal with a few appetizers.  For the appetizers, we got the chickpea flatbread, the arugula salad and the sea scallops.  The flatbread and salad were just OK.  The sea scallops would have been delicious except for the \"cured egg yolk\" which was infused in the avacado sauce.  For those who have never tried a cured egg yolk, I would consider yourself lucky.  Actually, the taste wasn't too bad.  The smell, however, reminded me of what you would smell if you were on the set of a nasty version of a Hoarders TV episode.  Must be an acquired taste.  For the main course, we chose the short rib ravioli and the cavatelli.  Both were excellent, especially the ravioli.  No complaints at all.  Overall, a very pleasant experience.  Good atmosphere.  Our waitress was very friendly.  The place was busy and had a nice vibe to it.  Unfortunately, some of the food was a slight disappointment."}
{"text":"Every time I have been to Casbah for lunch, brunch, or dinner, the food has been great and the service has been impeccable.  Sure, I've had more exceptionally delicious and unique meals in Pittsburgh, but Casbah has Consistent Awesomeness down pat.  Just get a reservation ahead of time.  Also, the desserts are mandatory!    The duck confit gnocchi is smashing-- it's a nice balance of slightly sweet and very savory--and my favorite is probably the Casbah Double-Cut Pork Chop: super-yum comfort food.  The short rib ravioli is some pot-roasty Goodness, and the long island duck is another great choice.    A nice surprise here are the great happy hour specials at the bar.  Try the Boyd & Blair cocktail and the sangria."}
{"text":"Amanda, bartender extraordinaire! Old School Whiskey Sour! Delish! Never fails to impress!"}
{"text":"The food here was absolute perfection; each bite was perfectly orchestrated to deliver optimal flavor and enjoyment. The service was also fantastic!  For my entree, I had the cioppino -- it may be one of the best that I've ever had. The bowl was filled with beautiful looking seafood: large shrimp, clams in their shells, mussels in their shells, a gorgeous piece of perfectly seasoned halibut, and enormous wonderfully cooked scallops. They knew how to cook each piece of seafood to showcase it well. And the charred sourdough served with the cioppino was the perfect complement to soak up all of the delicious, savory flavors of the broth without becoming a soggy mush! My grandfather had the halibut and loved it... Cleaned the plate!  I had heard rave reviews of the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, so we had to share one for dessert! My grandfather said it was incomparable to any bread pudding; it was a sweet, smooth, decadent indulgence that paired well with the house coffee.  And the complementary salted caramels presented with the check were also amazing! I definitely need to come back again to try more of the menu... I think only wonderful items could possibly come out of that kitchen!"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that it kills me to give Casbah two stars and I wish there were two rating systems - one for the food and another one for service since my review is really about the latter. The food as always is exceptional.  I have been going to Casbah for well over a decade and it is a place where my family has always celebrated special occasions because of the wonderful atmosphere, food and the great service - or what used to be great service.   We went to Casbah last night for dinner to celebrate a family birthday expecting to have a nice, memorable evening. Alas! that wasn't to be. Our server (Seth) and the service provided by him can be described in just one word - INDIFFERENCE. He went through the motions of taking our order and bringing us our food but that was it. We were never told of any specials. We were not brought any bread till we asked for it. We were not asked for re-fills on our drinks or even our water. We were not once asked how the food was and if we needed anything else. On ordering dessert, we were not asked if we needed coffee or drinks to go with and so on. In my book, indifference is worse than bad service.    I could have looked past it if it was just the server's style and lack of work ethic (every place has some of those people!) but what really highlighted this lackluster service was that the very same server was providing exceptional service to a neighboring table with a much larger party than ours. Perhaps because gratuity was automatically included? I don't know but suffice to say I was very disappointed and somewhat annoyed.   Casbah is not your \"neighborhood\" place to drop in for dinner and the food and ambiance don't come cheap. So the least they can do is to make sure that service is consistent. It is relatively easy to attract new customers but really tough to sustain them.  I hope this was just a one-time occurrence but I feel like I need to highlight it in a public forum in the hope that someone from Big Burrito sees this and has it addressed.   I'm so disappointed. I hope I can go back there again. I would hate to lose this place!"}
{"text":"Pasta fest should be called deception fest. We got an email inviting us to come to pasta fest thinking it would be regular portions at a discounted price. WRONG it was smaller portions at a higher price. I never felt so ripped off. $15 for one meatball and three bites of pasta. The server warned us about the small portion but wow . You got me this time but never again."}
{"text":"Well it's official Shadyside is becoming my new favorite area for restaurants.  Damn you Big Burrito Group with your local ingredients, contemporary design and excellent service.  I was here last night and on a Monday this place was doing brisk business (definitely a good sign).  The space itself is beautiful.  You  enter from S. Highland into the outdoor dining area, which because of the heaters is viable almost every day of the year.  There is plenty of seating outdoors and a few tables indoors.  The design is contemporary.  The bar is large and has a nice area opposite for more informal seating.  The one thing I dislike about the bar area is that the \"stools\" are actually chairs that are not moveable, so your distance next to your \"neighbor\" is pre-determined.  I also prefer to stand at  the bar instead of sitting and this set up makes that more difficult.  The wine selection is pretty extensive and they have a good happy hour special that any wine or premium cocktail is just $5, which is really good when many of their wines are priced at over $10 per glass.  The hostess was very nice and professional even though she was young taking our names as we went to the bar for a drink and then anticipating our return with two menus in hand.  The server was a nice enough guy and helpful when it came time for our dinner selection.  We ordered a bottle of conundrum which is a delicious choice and I guess in line with what others charge.  We were started with an olive tepenade (sp?) and some crusty toasted thinly sliced ciabatta I think.  The tepenade was too oily and salty for me, but I guess it's what I should expect since it's ground up olives basically.  The bread was great.  It was warm really hearty bread that was wheat I think, definitely not white.  It was served with room temperature butter with some sea salt on top.  Really good start.  We then tried the smoked salmon appetizer.  I'm a huge fan of smoked salmon and was pleased with the quality of the fish, served nicely with capers and chopped egg.  It also was served with a patatoe pancake that was crisp on the outside with warm and delicious  filling.  The only thing I was a bit perplexed about was why it wasn't served with some type of bread or crouton to put the salmon on.  However, the waiter was happy to oblige by bringing out a few of the toasted ciabatta.  We also tried the lamb mac and cheese (omg was this good).  The pasta was cooked al dente' and definitely made in house.  The sauce and lamb were amazing.  This would make a fine entree' in my opinion and is total comfort food reinvented.  The only detraction I'd say is that it is a very heavy dish to serve as an appetizer on a summer menu.  Fiona had the arugula salad which was nicely prepared with pork belly (kind of like bacon), feta, and a few other interesting ingredients.  We also tried the short rib ravioli, which was incredible as well albeit a heavy dish.  By the time we got to this I think we only tried one ravioli each (plenty of leftovers).  This is such a rich dish, because shortribs are like the epitome' of richness and then to wrap them in ravioli and add cream sauce is really indulgent.  But, then again this is my chef not my cardiologist.  I tried the Elysian Fields Lamb which was cooked perfectly medium and then served with their homemade pasta wrapped around some of the lamb as well.  This was really good and the pasta was a surprise.  I actually would have preferred a green vegatable on the side instead of pasta and mashed potatoes.  The bartenders are good, especially FionaOverall, a really good place and a nice flagship of the big burrito group."}
{"text":"I've been plenty and every time I enjoy the food, the drinks, and the environment. I would say it is missing a bit of the down home authenticity that most stellar restaurants in Pittsburgh seem to have. The dishes are inventive and delightful. The patio is perfect on a warm day. For all of these reasons I will continue to show here for an early dinner on occasion."}
{"text":"The rave reviews I'd heard for Casbah were so over the top, I thought it would be impossible to live up to.   Casbah has exceeded it's sky high expectations and made me a believer!  We got the brunch and while the $24 pre-fix menu isn't cheap, it actually felt like a steal because the ambiance, decor, friendly attentive staff, and generous portions of delicious, inventive food were all so fantastic!    The brunch pre-fix included your choice of breakfast cocktails, appetizer, entree, and amazing still steaming home made muffins and mint chocolate scones.  I'm anything but a light eater, and there was so much that I still had to take half my meal home!  We all got different things and there wasn't a single bite of anything that we didn't love.  I particularly recommend the Arugula salad, salmon and dill appetizer, and the scallop and grits entree, though you really can't go wrong.    The decor and music was just as unique, artistic, and beautiful as the rest of the Big Burrito hot spots.  We ate in the basement, with a beautiful fully stocked glass wine cellar, under lit stone tile walls and wooden ceiling trim.  Casbah isn't cheap, but I'd still consider it once of the best values in the city  because you get so much for your money.  I'd trust Casbah to celebrate any special event with a flawless dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent brunch spot.  For review #100, a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely fitting.  Casbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite meal and also what they do best.  I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  I started off with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  My companion ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh orange juice.  While waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super moist mini-muffins, scones, and super rich and buttery biscuits with honey butter.  The smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful fried potato cake.  There was just the perfect amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully with the smoked salmon.  I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty complex flavor.  My entree reminded me of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  I love braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, tender, and super rich.  The best part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  This dish itself is enough to make me a regular.  I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty good too.  Service was good, ambiance was good, portions were big, quality was excellent, AND they take reservations.  Sometimes I don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (Point Brugge, Coca Cafe, etc.), but most times I'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh...always delicious always fresh!!  So so so good like my girlfriend`s legs."}
{"text":"AVOID! We drove past this place a few times and thought it looked cool. Many people recommended it, so we gave it a shot.   We walked into a very tacky atmosphere and the food only made it worse. My girlfriends shrimp was over cooked and fishy. My entree was tasteless. We just burned $170. What a waste of time."}
{"text":"This restaurant came recommended by a friend and I was not disappointed! The hummus appetizer was delicious, as well as the English Pea Risotto (vegetarian for my daughter) and the famous Cioppino. I was also recommended a flight of Rose wine when I couldn't decide between them. They were all delicious! As a dessert we shared the strawberry rhubarb croustade which melted in your mouth! As a nice touch the kitchen had written Happy Birthday on the plate since it was my daughter's 17'th birthday! We will definitely go back when in the area, and I would recommend the restaurant to all my friends. We were sitting in the basement, which was nice and quiet, but their outdoor seating looked very cool as well (more noisy)."}
{"text":"If you want a quiet evening - ask for a table downstairs.   It was delightful, much more spacious and high ceilings and soft romantic lighting.  This is  NOT the room for your holiday office party ( unless you get the whole room)  Veal and pork meatballs were juicy, tasty, rich flavor   Burrata and greens were light and flavorful.  Gnocchi light and airy with very flavorful sauce.  Cavatelli were light and flavorful. Expensive but excellent wine list.  Chocolate raspberry great pudding- was very good but not exceptional- don't order it if you're watching the clock.  In summary EAT HERE"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of almost all things Big Burrito and Casbah is no exception.  I have been to Casbah so many times over the years that the visits all meld together, but on this particularly occasion I had the arugula salad to begin with which was delicious and my friend had the butternut squash soup which she really enjoyed.  We both ordered the the Scottish Salmon which was so delicious and tender that it literally melted in my mouth.  The house-made pastas are always a great option if as is the duck or the lamb which I've had both on a few occasions.  Their wine list is always spectacular - on this visit I had a glass of the Riesling from Urban, Germany and my friend had a glass of Pinot Grigio from Lenotti, Italy.  We had no room for dessert on this visit, but any of their desserts that have the Meyer lemons is always a hit and I am a die-hard chocolate fan and I will forgo chocolate for one of their delicious meyer lemon dessert creations.  I haven't been to Casbah for brunch in quite some time, but after having gone to Eleven recently for brunch, I'm keen to try Casbah for brunch again soon."}
{"text":"Came her with mom for a birthday brunch last weekend. We have lived in Pittsburgh, specifically the East End, since 99, and have never been here. They do have complimentary valet which is nice, however we found a spot right out in front. When we walked in, I was surprised at how large it was. I didn't realize it was so big from walking past it numerous times throughout the years. We sat outside which was great as it was very sunny and warm. There were a lot of families, couples, and friends around which was nice to see the diverse crowd. Our waitress Jamie was excellent! She answered all of our questions and was gracious and kind. We were given delicious bread and honey butter for the table. One of the breads had kumquats which was so good! Mom and I both had mimosas with our brunch. I started with the roasted beet salad with ricotta, greens, herbs, and green lentils (no almonds as I have an allergy) and mom started with the crispy calamari and rock shrimp with lemon aioli and agrodolce. Everything was so delicious and filling. The beets had a great flavor and mom's shrimp was done perfectly! For our main meal, I ordered the orecchiette with grilled chicken, goat cheese, and dried cranberries. Mom had the sea scallops with caramelized onions, scrambled eggs, white corn grits, and a croissant. Mom's grits were so creamy and delicious that I ordered a side serving for myself. Honestly, we took most of the entrees home because we were stuffed from the appetizers. The food was delicious, portions are nicely sized. We had absolutely no complaints! We looked at the dessert menu and ordered two dark chocolate and raspberry bread puddings to go. Jamie was so sweet that she wrote instructions on our container so we can cook it properly when we got home, which was a very nice touch. Mom's bill came to about $80 or so which was nice. All in all, we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Sharia don't like it, and neither does Becky.   Boy and I went to Casbah on a warm Tuesday evening. The restaurant wasn't busy, and we were seated in the inviting outdoor patio. Our waitress was very pleasant and extremely informative about both the drink and food menus.   We shared a bottle of Mission la Caminade (Malbec, French). This was a very good, medium-bodied wine.   Many yelpers have raved about Casbah's bread and pesto. I don't get it. I've had much better sourdough elsewhere and the pesto wasn't anything to write home about.   I had the asparagus soup with crab for an appetizer.  The soup was served cold and tasted fresh enough, but something was off, and I barely ate half of it.   I ordered the orecchiette pasta as an entree, which was served with grilled chicken and cranberries in a goat cheese cream sauce. I am upset to report that this tasted rather bland. The cranberries were the only spark of flavor in the dish.  Boy ordered the ricotta cavatelli pasta, which was in a marinara sauce with sausage and ricotta. I am sad to report that this too was tasteless. The ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish.   We glanced at the dessert menu, after spending so much on food we didn't enjoy, boy and I decided to cross the street for ice cream, instead.   Overall, Casbah has a nice atmosphere and service, but their food quality doesn't match the price tag."}
{"text":"We dined here for my wife's birthday last year. We started out at the bar ordering cocktails. I had a tasty cocktail with bourbon. We finished our drinks and made out way over to our table. We started out with a cheese tasting, which was very good. For entrees she ordered the Halibut and I had the Red Pepper Casereccia. This was seared sea scollops with a red pepper pasta. This entree made my list of favorite dish ever eaten. It was so delicious. I cannot wait to have it again!"}
{"text":"Had a very lack-luster Mother's Day brunch at Casbah yesterday. Despite having a very late reservation time of 2:30 p.m., we were seated in the dungeon-like basement dining room. I asked for tables upstairs in the daylight but there was allegedly no way to accommodate my request. Worst part about the basement is the thumping from the sub-woofer located above -- really ridiculous. Service was fine. Timing of drinks and first brunch course were acceptable given it was a busy day, but then gap of 35+ minutes for entrees left us all sitting there, not enjoying the dark of the basement nore the perpetually thumping base. An utterly forgettable mother's day brunch (luckily she took it in stride) but I think Casbah will not be at the top of the list in my book for quite awhile."}
{"text":"Another great big burrito restaurant, Casbah offers some great wine and spectacular food in some great, and varied, dining rooms.  The three dinning rooms, \"outside,\" inside and downstairs.  While downstairs isn't always open when it is try and get a seat down there, it is beautiful and quiet.  Perfect for a larger group of people.  Outside is always open and you don't really realize you are outside aside from the non-padded patio chairs and heat lamps all around.  The food is Mediterranean fusion, not exactly sure what is meant by that but it is good. The hummus here was actually the first hummus that I had ever had and I am sorry to say it is what I compare all other to, few match up.  The wine list is extensive, but if you are going for an upscale bar this isn't the place, for that you'll want to go down the road to Soba.  If you want a nice place to have a drink and a conversation, Casbah is it."}
