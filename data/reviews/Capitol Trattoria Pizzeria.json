{"text":"Ordered delivery from here on a Sunday in order to avoid the other standard corporate options at our disposal. The pizza came at the time it was advertised but the quality was awful. It's weird to say, but I've never regretted not ordering Domino's in my life. The pizza was insanely dry and tasted like pizza you would make at school in grade three by ten year olds. Really terrible, I do not recommend ordering delivery from this place, furthest thing from classic pizza, don't let the fancy name fool you."}
{"text":"Really good food at a reasonable price. I came here on a Monday night at 8 pm and there were only 4 tables that were full.  Can't comment how it would have been if you came on a busy day. Service was excellent, super friendly servers. Very family-run vibe. The gnocchi was delicious and super filling. I could only eat half of the portion and was super full. They served warm bread with the meal, always a plus!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here. In no particular order here are my experiences. The owner has a puss of a face than could turn milk sour. Both her and her husband are unfriendly and almost sinister. They ignored my starter order and just gave us our mains. The food is processed and tastes like rubbish. I could do a better job myself. 45 dollars for two awful meals with awful service. I doubt they have any repeat customers."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for this place. Didn't even get to use it!! We left 10 minutes after walking in. The hostess/owner has the worst attitude. She was not happy that we had a groupon first off. Then she asked us if we had looked at the menu online. We told her we hadn't and looked forward to seeing the menu to which she responded that they in fact did not have an actual menu because they were changing it. Really? No menu?? Then she went on to inform us of the fixed menu offered through the Groupon. I asked her if that was specified on the website because I hadn't seen mention of it. At that point she walked away from me and started rambling angrily as she walked around the restaurant (which was completely empty on a Saturday evening). Some other people walked in but saw how the hostess/owner was acting and they left! Ultimately what we learned is that their customer Service is horrendous, their marketing on Groupon is false and a scam. So we packed up our party of 10 people and left. While the hostess encouraged us to leave! Never again."}
{"text":"I've lived in the little Italy neighbourhood for nearly 10 years and make it a point to try all the restaurants and bars.  I've been to Capitol before (once) and didn't remember much. That being said, I recently went back (today) and was very disappointed! The service was disorganized and felt as if they didn't want us to have only drinks on the patio.  3 people came to ask if we were attended and gave us a weird face after we said,\" yes, thank you. We just ordered our glasses of wine. \"  Not sure why it was such an odd experience but it was.  Might have to come back in a couple years and see how it is then."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by its great corner location and friendly patio. First off, our server had far too many tables to look after, so service was quite sub par. Forgetting the basics like refilling water and remaining at our table while I paid via credit card.  We ordered bruschetta which was nothing special. Could make better at my home, and really wasn't authentic Italian at all. We then ordered the fettuccine rustica that had chicken and sausage in it, based in a red tomato sauce. The pasta quality itself was actually quite good, but the sauce was nearly flavourless, and worst of all, the sausage seemed to taste quite off putting for not only me, but my boyfriend as well.  We didn't eat any more of that dish (which only came with 4 bits of sausage. Not quite worth the nearly $20 we paid for it).  Next was the calabrese pizza. Another pricey item that could have been from a late night pizza place, as the ingredients tasted like nothing authentic, but rather Schneider processed pepperoni and basic cheese. It was also cooked on what seemed like a conveyor belt, so the pizza didn't have that stone oven crunch and taste that one would look for in a good Italian restaurant.  Lastly, when the server came around to collect our plates (which had well over half the pizza left and 3/4 of the pasta), I said politely not to make a big deal over it, but the sausage in the pasta tasted off, and we didn't feel comfortable eating it. She apologized and took it back.  We get the bill soon there after and see this meal cost around 45 dollars (a meal with no drinks), and there was no compensation for the pasta or anything else as well. It was clear we didn't enjoy the experience, so at the very least a complimentary dessert would have been nice. More attention and compensation definitely would be been appreciated. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a place to eat an Italian dinner on college and we decided to walk into the completely empty Capitol Trattoria. We should have taken the hint... no one was eating there for a reason. The service of the restaurant staff was excellent, but to sum up the meal in a word, it was: uninspired.  The one stand out dish that we tasted was the deep fried calamari. They were really delicious and set a high bar for our dinner that, sadly, none of the other dishes lived up to.  The Margherita pizza was just passable but not the least bit impressive in any way. When I think of a traditional Margherita, it's prepared with blobs of fresh flavourful mozzarella and fresh herbs. Instead we were served a pizza made with some generic shredded cheese and dried oregano. The pizza still tasted fine, and I was happy to eat it, but I certainly expected more from an Italian restaurant on college.  The pasta dishes we ordered were the most disappointing aspect of the meal. The noodles themselves felt 100% store-bought and the sauce was equally unimpressive.   I may stop in for some calamari, but I won't be returning here for a full meal in the future."}
{"text":"I got the margherita pizza and it couldn't have tasted more bland. frozen pizzas from grocery stores taste way better.  As for the service, this is the WORST restaurant I have ever encountered. First, my friend got the penne vodka dish and asked to change the pasta to linguine. A few minutes later, our server comes back with whom I presume to be the owner. She stays behind giving the dirtiest look to my friend as the server explains that they are out of linguine and suggested spaghetti instead. A few minutes later, the bitter old lady returns with glasses of water, continuing to have a sour expression and not uttering a word and not even a reply to our \"thanks!\" By the time we finish our meal, the same bitter old lady takes our plates and I ask to get the bills. The bitter old lady mutters \"yeah\" inaudibly. By then, the restaurant is empty and 15 minutes pass and we still have not gotten our bills. I had to ask another employee about the matter and it came about 5 minutes later.  They need, and the bitter old lady in particular, a major attitude change to up these 1 and 2 start reviews because that's all they're going to get."}
{"text":"Good tasty food for reasonable prices compared to some other spots in the area. Seems to be a family run joint but I'm not a 100% certain of that. We made a couple of changes to our order and which were accommodated with a smile which is rare in Toronto. The only thing I would improve would be just the furniture, especially the white table tops and the patio chairs. Might help attract more client√®le."}
{"text":"we initially came to another place for food across the street but there was a lineup and no seats on the patio. whereas this place had seats and tables available on the patio for our group.  the prices are regular for the area. pizzas for one person range between $11-$15. pastas about the same. few veg options. they also bring fresh bread with butter. Yum.  the time it took to get served was a bit too long. about 45min or so. which I wouldn't complain about in other times as it gives time to socialize with your group but we were time constrained and very hungry so this seemed to be a bit too much of a wait.   however the moment we told our waitress about the wait we got our food delivered almost immediately.  all in all not a bad italian place."}
{"text":"My mother, cousin and I visited the Capitol last evening. After a long day walking in the sun, we were happy to sit out on their patio and drink some delicious Sangria... and everything went downhiill from there.   After waiting an hour for our food, we inquired.,.. they hadn't even started cooking it. Instead of apologizing and/or offering us a complimentary beverage or something they kept asking if we wanted to cancel the order. NO WE'RE STARVING PEOPLE. The managers also screamed at their staff.   The manager proceeded to scream at us in front of the whole restaurant and then when our food FINALLY came (it was not even that good) he had the audacity to come ask how it tasted and screamed to the whole restaurant \"they're eating it, because we make great food.\"  Bottom line: I would never set foot there again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fantastic, the owner/server were kind, the pasta was perfect...but the veal was kinda horrifyingly bad. The Groupon coming with salad (tho Caesar is a weird Italian option), appetizer, pasta, meat and wine/dessert (tiramisu was frozen) is amazing value, but the lack of menu on Groupon and in the restaurant made it really confusing what we were ordering. The bread not being cut is also a bit odd.  Expected consistent quality from an Italian restaurant with this grand of an exterior/interior in the heart of little italy, but they need to step up their food game. Wish we saw reviews before coming. Worth it for Groupon, but to ask \"groupon?\" after we entered feels like they gave up."}
{"text":"This place is the pits. I knew I was in trouble when I heard the unmistakable sound of a microwave door slamming. The lady at the table next to me sent her cannelloni back because the middle was still frozen. My risotto was swimming in \"cream sauce\" because...risotto is supposed to have a cream sauce? I took a bite and bit down into a lump of powder. It was either fake cheese sauce powder or dirt from the mushrooms. I'm not sure which I want to believe it was. When I told them I didn't like my dish, they did comp it, but they still charged us for the other two frozen dinners and the foul Quattro Formaggi pizza that had cheddar cheese on it. Our bill was $87. The owner and his wife were crazy annoyed that we didn't like our food. Avoid at all costs. They will not be open very long."}
{"text":"As we approached one of the few Little Italy establishements with patio seating available on a busy Saturday evening, we we're greeted by a warm hostess who was able to place us immediately...that was the highlight of the meal.   Between the rock hard bread to the lack of beer available on tap all the way to the pizzas that looked fresh out of the Delicio box, we we're very quickly reminded why quality dining comes to those who wait.  I would suggest the 1 minute walk across the street to any of the nearby restaurants in Little Italy before dining here."}
{"text":"For those who don't want to read the whole review; I'll sum up my thoughts here. Food ranged from ok at best to appetite killing.  The service is enthusiastic but dependent on the money you are expected to spend.  Worst groupon I've done. Doesn't list what will be available on their ad. Would never come here again.  Literally joined yelp just to warn people away from this place.  Discovered this place because of a groupon.  There was no menu shown on the groupon advertisement and just mentioned   \"Four-Course Italian Dinner for Two. Includes:  Bruschetta Two Salads Two Entrees One Pizza or Two Pastas\"  Underneath was a link to \"see the the menu\" which leads to their yellow pages and shows a full menu with no mention of groupon menus or even prix fixe menus.  I mention all of this because the first impression we got when we walked in is finding out that there is a groupon menu and they can't even print it off for people to see because they and I quote \"feel that the menu is easy anyways\"  Course they'd feel like that offering only 2 options for each course only and changing up what is offered even more.  The options were a caesar salad and some salad of mixed greens with tomatoes, onions & cucumbers tossed with an Italian vinaigrette. There was no option of pizza and the only options for pasta was penne vodka or a meat lasagna.  The 2 options for entrees were veal parmigiana and a grilled chicken breast topped with mushrooms and onions.    Since we had spent the money already we stayed and ordered the food.  We ordered different things so we can try all the food.  More disappoint was on the way, particularly for me personally.  The bruschetta was seasoned and tasted fine except that the bread seemed a little stale and the rest of it was incredibly soggy.  Both the salads were good.  More than enough of all the ingredients expected and nothing wrong with them.  The Penne vodka was pretty good.  Good sauce and noodles were cooked well.  Unfortunately I got the meat lasagna which came out saltier and with a lot less sauce then I was expecting.  There were about 6 or 7 layers of pasta and all the sauce that was barely there squeezed out from all the layers too easily and was oily and not very good.  I could not detect any cheese in the lasagna at all so it was basically like eating layered noodles with some ground beef on the side with a bit of sauce on it.  I was hoping this would be the worst of it but then the entrees arrived.  The chicken breast was okay but mediocre.  It came a little dry and was only saved by the mushrooms on top of it.  This was at least passable for a groupon meal but the veal parmigiana that I ordered completed what has been the worst groupon meal I've had and at least top 10 worst meals in my life.  The veal was so tough that it took some strength to cut a piece off.  The inside was stringy and wouldn't come apart.  The sauce and cheese on top did nothing to help the flavour and completely killed my appetite.  I literally ate 1 bite and didn't eat the rest of it . I just finished the vegetables around it which I hoped would increase my appetite.  The service was originally ok and seemed fine until it was apparent we were groupon customers and then everything seemed forced or salesman-like.  His attitude when we asked for a written menu was condescending and he didn't even try and see which groupon we had or take our word that there was nothing that said there was a groupon menu.  He did come to check on us several times during the meal which at first seemed like good customer service but later just felt like he was trying to rush us out of his restaurant.  The final act of his service came when I asked if they take credit card or is it only cash and he responded that they do but cash would be better.  That alone would be ok except he kept repeating cash would be better 2 or 3 times when I responded I'd rather use my card and finally just stopped responding to him and stared at him until he went to get the machine.  Not worth groupon for sure and would not want to waste my money for the regular menu and help their business."}
{"text":"Having not only been a customer but a server at this \"restaurant\" I would tell anyone to run away from this place.Here goes some facts you'd like to know before you step in: -the \"bottled\" 1 L still water is actually Toronto tap water in old and opened bottles. So your just paying 5$ for tap water. -all WINE bottles are kept by the owner and refilled with cheaper wines on the spot. So you think you getting that 70$ Malbec, probably NOT.most likely the 23$ version from the LCBO. -if you also like being talked about and critiqued about. this is the place.The owners will stand at the bar and bad mouth about you until you leave. Poking fun at your kids,husband and basically anything else to amuse themselves. -during \"busy\" hours get ready to be aggressively talked at by Tonina (owner) who will seat you back talk you like no other. GUYS IF YOU WANT TO BE HARASSED AND DUPED THIS IS THE PLACE."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Little Italy.  The patio is warm and inviting and the inside decor is very nice.  I LOVE the mussels!!!  I usually will have a pasta, but I will try whatever seems to appeal to my taste buds.  This is a \"must visit\" whenever I am in town and I can't wait to eat here again in the near future."}
{"text":"I've always thought there was something special about Capitol. My girlfriends and I have been going there for almost 10 years and we will continue to do so for many years to come   True, it's not the busiest place on College and the ambiance is not as cozy or unique as, say Kalendar, but the food is delicious and the owners are some of the nicest people I've met. I always get the gnocchi con pesto and my girlfriend gets the pizza margherita. I would say the pastas outweigh the pizzas in terms of being excellent, but it all depends on how you like your Italian thin-crust pizzas! The salads are great and the wines are very reasonably-priced (ideal).   Capitol has reopened completely renovated after a fire a few months ago and it's lovely inside. The patio is very large and we often find ourselves there in the summer - easy to get a seat if one arrives early! In general the place doesn't get busy until later so it's a great option when you're hungry and want to eat right away.   4 stars from me!"}
{"text":"I know this place has pizza, which I haven't tried. So i'm basing my review on the pasta I ordered here.   I ordered a vegetarian pasta, which was overpriced for what it was- salty, undercooked, and swimming in olive oil. There was also way too much pasta, I couldn't bring myself to finish it because of the taste and quantity. Ick. My date also said their pasta was unpleasant to eat. We probably ended up eating more bread (they give you a basket of bread with the food) then pasta.   Service was ok, but the food was terrible."}
{"text":"Went here on a Groupon for about $25 a person. Included wine, app, salad, pasta AND a main dish. Well with the vodka penne pasta alone with salad and bread. We were entertained by the owner's husband, the Portugese husband. Very helpful. Love most of the meal, but veal Parmesan was so tough as to be left behind by one of our quartet. Overall, a great night out."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Ridiculous waiting times (more than an hour for appetizers). Some others were more brave than my party and left after half an hour waiting for their drinks.We order bruschetta and crostini as appetizers and couple of pizzas. The toppings were scarce, taste and visual appeal couldn't compete with a franchise pizza. The prices are high taking into consideration the quality of the product. There was a lady there supervising a handful of very upset servers, she was awful to everyone. It really ruined the meal.  Very disappointing. Don't even try!"}
{"text":"This is one the utmost worst restaurant experiences of my life. I wish I could give it -5 stars. NEVER go here. It only survives due to its good location.   My pizza was cold and the cheese had soaked through to the soggy crust. It also took almost an hour to get this dreadful pizza.   I was going to order some sangria until I observed whom I believe to be the owner lick the stirring spoon and then dip it back into the jug of presumably cheap sangria.   A bottle of still San Pelegrino I ordered tasted suspicious like Toronto tap water. When I asked for ice the server looked in the direction of the owner who shot a dirty look in my direction. No ice was to be had.   I'm not sure who I feel worse for, myself for the dreadful experience, or the poor staff that most put up with this reprehensible owner. I could overhear her fighting with the cook staff in the back - she was vicious."}
{"text":"It was horibble. Unrespectful and rude owner I have ever seen, never again do not spend any money for here. She is acting like Gordon Ramsey we can hear her when she screaming her stuff, it is so uncomfortable. Never again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great service. A lovely patio and a great location. Wouldn't have changed a thing."}
{"text":"Came to this place seeking a nice bottle of wine..we were torn between 2 choices hence we asked the waitress for options and based on what she said we decided to go with her choice.  When the wine was opened, we took a sip and did not like it. We asked her if we could change the wine and be charged for one glass since we technically did drink and they could serve the rest by the glass & make more $ out of it.  She refused. And then she has the nerve to talk about the weather?! Wow!  The issue wasn't about the bottle being $35 but more around principle which she failed to grasp..epically!  We paid and left more than half the bottle on the table.  When it comes to customer service, if it were me, I would've made sure of the fact that the people that would've been \"under my care\" would have at the very least been provided with options to, bare minimum, be met half way.  Oh well..that's me.  Ain't going back ever...that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Italy vs. Uruguay match during the World Cup. The restaurant was packed, but very poorly managed. The hostess was rude as soon as I entered, and my experience went downhill from there.   I understand that the World Cup is a challenging time for restaurants, and I was prepared for a wait for food and drinks, but after entering I waited 15 minutes for a server to even come over, and another 10 minutes for my cappuccino (I ordered a water with it, but that was forgotten).  Our server approached us during the match and said that \"now is a good time to order - you won't have to wait long\". My boyfriend ordered a calabrese pizza ($11) and I ordered the gamberi alla grilla ($11) (shrimp with marinara sauce). We waited for 45 minutes for our food, and when it arrived it was a huge disappointment. My shrimp was served with two wedges of lemon, both of which were drenched in sauce so I couldn't handle them. The shrimp was overcooked and tough.   My boyfriend's pizza had maybe 4 pieces of hot pepper and 8 pepperoni. It was under-sauced and under-cooked.   Our server ignored us for most of our time here. She rarely came over to ask if we wanted something else to drink. It also took ages to get her attention to pay - she seemed to be walking around the room in a complete daze."}
{"text":"A fab spot for your Italian meal in little Italy in Toronto where the owners make you feel like family! Grazie Mille, we'll be back! Don't miss out on the penne al vodka."}
{"text":"I don't like writing non-favorable reviews..but this restaurant really just was not good at all.  It was a saturday, and we had friends visiting from out of town. The plan was to go to Libretto for pizza, but they could handle the 1 hour wait so we tried this place.  The pizza came (not as advertised..ie. missing topping) and the toppings that were on the pizza were scarce.  way too salty, I was thirsty for the next two days.."}
{"text":"My first negative review :/  Processed chicken. Really guys? $20 for frozen chicken with those fake chargrill marks in it. I don't understand how they're still in business. Gordon Ramsey you've found your next Kitchen Nightmares contestants."}
{"text":"After one too many bad experiences at Cafe Dominico (accross the street- see review) I decided to check this place out based on the 2 reviews here. It was delicious! I ordered the veal and they happily allowed me to substitute the salad/potatoes for pasta instead. The quality of my and my friend's meal was very good. Pasta tasted homemade. The portions were generous. It is a little more expensive than some other places in the area but it's worth it. I will definately be coming back!"}
