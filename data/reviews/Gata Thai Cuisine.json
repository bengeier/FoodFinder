{"text":"Great Place...Very clean, good food, and even budget friendly. Great service and you must try the coconut icecream!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Not only can I order through GrubHub, but I've never gotten anything I didn't like!  They're great too, because they honor their frequent order coupons even over the phone and the delivery people are so thoughtful and considerate!  Delicious food, delightful delivery - it's a winning combination for me!"}
{"text":"Did not live up to the 4 star rating at all. I had the lunch Pad Thai, the noodles were dry and sticky, it was just like one big noodle hill and separating the noodles was like try to cast a line to fish. Overall the pad Thai was tasteless, bland flavor like a cheap casino buffet trying to serve asian food. The only thing was the Thai tea. On the door they have a paper sign that says 10% off with cash but I didn't get it at all. Now I know that there won't be a next time as the food just didn't taste good and I eat a lot of Thai as my family is from that area of the world."}
{"text":"Skeptical view from outside but as soon as you walk in you feel a little bit more comfortable on your decision lol very friendly, clean and quick.  I had the pad Thai with shrimp, very tasty  Didn't skip on shrimp or amount of food Definitely get ur money's worth and the quality of the food is worth every penny.  I will definitely be back to try one of those curries :)"}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite Thai restaurant in Henderson! When I first discovered they delivered to my address, I ordered from them for the next three weeks straight. The one dish I'll always get is their Tom Yum fried rice, which has an excellent Tom yum flavor and works extremely well with rice instead of soup. I've tried the pad kea mao, which I'd also order again and the Yum Woon Sen, a delicious spicy noodle salad. If you're feeling really hungry for an app, definitely try their Thai beef jerky. They do it right! Prices are good and portions are perfect. Glad this gem is by my house!"}
{"text":"Very freindly and helpful employees Foood  is always  on point best thai place around."}
{"text":"I often get delivery from here.  The portions are large, the food is good and the service is fast.  I am particularly fond of the Basil Fried Rice and the Panang and Yellow Curries.  I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Definitely not my favorite Thai. The egg rolls were drenched in oil, there was no way I could eat them. And the chicken paid Thai didn't have any flavor."}
{"text":"Small place in a strip mall. You can tell they mostly do take-out business, which is fine because they actually pay attention to you if you're the only person dining in. Bonus: free refills on Thai iced tea if you dine in! It's solid Americanized Thai food, and the service is prompt and friendly. Andy L.'s review called this place \"no-frills,\" which is accurate. It's not fancy, but who needs fancy when you get free refills on Thai iced tea? Also, they also do a 10% discount if you pay cash.  I ordered the Massamun curry with chicken, which was pretty standard. I did like that the rice came in a metal bowl with a lid to keep it warm. Definitely a good portion of food; I couldn't finish it, and the leftovers were enough for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"I'm not too big of a fan of Thai food but this place was pretty dang good! My hubby and I were staying at the Fiesta nearby and decided to check Yelp for oriental food in the area. We spotted Gata with some good ratings and decided to give it a try. We weren't disappointed! I really enjoyed the War Won Ton Soup and the Glass Chicken Noodles Dish. The service was swift, the restaurant was clean and the waitress was very prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery several times. Fast and orders correct. Great Thai food, comparable with Pin Kwao or Naga. Drunken noodles, pad woon sen, curries, chicken wings, Thai basil...all awesome"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Excellent food. I even tried the crispy duck (a risk at many restaurants) however it was perfect.  GREAT value for money in an informal atmosphere and 10% off for cash."}
{"text":"Back when this location used to be Wok In Express, my wife and I visited all of the time.  When that restaurant closed, we were curious to see what would follow.  When the sign finally went up that it was going to be a Thai place, we were ecstatic.  We had been looking for a Thai place close to home after experiencing the disappointment of Penn's Thai house.  The thing about Gata is that it can be very hit or miss.  The Spicy Basil is phenomenal, truly.  The flavor, the kick, everything about it.  But we've had very little luck trying everything else on the menu.  The ginger chicken proved to be acceptable, though not as memorable.   The pepper steak is fairly bland.  The curries are all actually really good, so I highly recommend those as well.  Their spicy scale of 1-10 varies dramatically based on the chef that day.  To be fair, I'm white, so my ability to withstand super spicy foods is not very good.  But sometimes when I order a 2 spicy, it is perfect.  It's got a great kick to it without also kicking my ass.  And then other times, when I order a 2, it's barely edible because it's so damn spicy.  The restaurant itself is also kind of gritty and does not smell good at all.  We usually order the food as take-out, just to avoid eating there.    When everything comes together, with the perfect amount of spicy, this place is without equal."}
{"text":"I live right across! And me and my boyfriend just discovered this place! Im a huge chow main and noodle judge and this is by far one of the best! I know this is the beginning to something for me and my bf! We love this place definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I love papaya salad. I could eat it every day. That being said, I decided to try it at Gata because it conveniently just opened up by my house. The presentation of it was perfect, it tasted great and I was satisfied. There are only two things I would ask for next time. It seemed a tad spicy for a 2. Next time I'll try a 0 or 1. The dressing was good but I usually ask for more fish sauce so it's saltier... The Thai tea was excellent and totally a great value at 3 bucks. Anyone who expects anything cheaper is not being realistic. You cannot compare this to the restaurant that was there before as it was a different type of restaurant. They have all my Thai comfort faves on the menu .I will definitely be going there often as it is close, priced accordingly, and in my opinion good Thai food generally speaking."}
{"text":"Love this little gem  I only ever order one thing  Pa nang curry chicken. Amazing.   And I'm not even a fan of Thai iced tea but this place makes one so delicious i can't order with out.  So i usually do take out but the one time i did delivery they forgot my tea but the man was overly apologetic and rushed back with the drink in 5 minutes. If you like authentic Thai, and looking for a lower price,  this place is great  By the way,  %10 cash discount"}
{"text":"Nice and clean inside, Thai or Chinese food, not trying to do that insufferable fusion menu that places trying to be too hipoften do, you'd be hard pressed to find Thai food this fresh and authentic made by real Thai people especially tops for bang for buck$! I'm coming back and might try a little Chinese next time, choices are good, and nice to not have to navigate through Spring Mt.! Staff was friendly and and asked my share of question's which they cheerfully answered."}
{"text":"Walked in and it smelled like the sewer had backed up.  The gal behind the counter asked us how many were in our party we answered \"four\".  She grunted and rolled her eyes.  No thank you."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Thai restaurant that is very affordable.  There is a 10 percent discount if you pay with cash.  I love the Thai basil chicken fried rice, the larb gai, and the wintons.  Staff is friendly and the food is consistent.  My only knock is that even when you order it spicey number 10, it still isn't quite hot enough."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout on a Saturday night....food was so bland doesn't feel like Thai food......fried rice was salty and no thai flavor at all. Egg rolls were good."}
{"text":"Good solid food, great service.  Had the lunch special red and yellow curry.  Thai used tea as well... Perfect portion."}
{"text":"i love this place!! they serve delicious food and the people here are very friendly! they give you a 10% discount if you are paying with cash and even have those little cards for every time you order a certain amount you receive a stamp. once the card is half way full you get a free thai tea and then when the card is fully stamped you get a free entry! i am very picky when it comes to asian food but i have no complaints about this place. i even took my mom here and she loved it!! the portion are generous and the prices are great! i will definitely be coming back!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great price for great food.  My wife and I do the Penang curry lunch special with the stuffed chicken wings and my kids love the beef and noodle soup. (It's similar to pho) They usually deliver to our house but when we do go there the place is so clean."}
{"text":"Best Thai! Papaya salad and spring rolls all day! Plus very well priced lunch specials."}
{"text":"This is my go to place whenever I come by to visit my family! They literally have the best Thai food in town, from their house fried rice to their Curry, there is so much wonderful flavor that comes with each of their dishes!  I highly recommend trying their Gata Thai Fried Rice as it's cooked so amazingly well. Throw in some of their amazing spring rolls and you're really rolling in paradise! I usually grab these two items to go which comes out to about $16 so it can be a little pricey but you're paying for quality Thai food which is unmatched in the vegas or Henderson area.   The servers and cashiers are very nice and prompt, I wish they wore name tags so I knew who to thank but I can honestly say I've had good experiences with em all.  Great little business that oughta have more attention, and looking forward to my next plate of fried rice soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, wow! I had the beef salad, hot&sour soup and egg rolls, I could have made a meal out of just the soup and egg rolls. Everything was freshly prepared, came to the table hot, and the staff were very friendly. I'll make it a point to come back!"}
{"text":"Gata Thai falls under my \"walkable distance\" restaurant, so it's more for those days when I want to taking my lounging to the next level. They don't judge when I pick up my pad thai in my pajamas.  The pad thai itself is very decent. I'm no expert in Thai cuisine, but Gata gets the job done. The food is definitely delicious since I keep coming back here on my days off. The pad thai is lacking in protein so sometimes I add in some leftover heated up chicken from my fridge and I get my balanced meals from the dish.  The service is very friendly and the staff makes sure that my order is right.  Gata Thai is a no-frills, all-business type of restaurant, and if you're looking for straightforward, no-questions-asked service in Henderson, I highly recommend Gata Thai for when you need some food to feed your extreme lounging."}
{"text":"Craving Pad Thai. 1st time here, came for lunch on a Saturday. Open but no customers. Should have been a sign enough to turn around and go somewhere else. But you never know so I stayed and ordered chicken Pad Thai. Well it was the 2nd worst I've ever had.  Didn't look or taste fresh. Chicken was obviously precooked, cold and dried out from laying around. Even the noodles didn't seem fresh, how do you do that.  Flavor was mediocre at best.  I'm marking this one off my list."}
{"text":"Overall decent food. Food came out fast but felt like It might have been mass produced in back. But I will def go back and enjoy again. The Thai iced tea was phenomenal though."}
{"text":"The pad thai here is my favorite but there are lots of good options. This is my favorite take out place because you can tell the food and ingredients used are always very fresh. One entree is huge you can definitely share or have extra meals later. If you haven't tried this place you need to."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised in finding this place!  Delivery is always on time or early! Super friendly and the food is really really good.. We've had the Pad Thai, Singapore Noodles, Thai Beef salad- all awesome- and I crave the Chicken Larb on a regular basis.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"They're right across the street from my house so we order pretty frequently here and plus my fav food is Thai"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Thai place in Henderson. The food is always delicious, service is super quick, and the prices are great for the portion size. Ive tried a ton of other Thai places and they dont come nearly close to this. Love the quality and consistency with their menu. The lunch specials are a really great deal too."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Prices are soo reasonable nd the food is soo good. This literally reminds me of my childhood. the customer service is amazing. This is my new food spot for a daily lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Good food! I look forward to coming back and trying more dishes . they got 4 instead of 5 because they could improve the ambiance."}
{"text":"I've ordered several times take out dinner: noodles and panang curry. From the first time figured that their curry is quite spicy, so I've been asking for mild spice. Every single time I've gotten very spicy curry, to the point I can't eat it. What's the point of having a chart of spiciness if it always comes out extra spicy...? Can't order food from this place anymore come out to waste of money..."}
{"text":"Good Thai food. Pad see ew and garlic steak are the best things in the menu. Free Thai tea with check in. Good service.   Only negative is the interior atmosphere, a bit outdated and dirty"}
{"text":"This place just opened right next to my house so I thought I'd give it a try. At first we weren't sure if they were even open yet but they definitely are! The place looks like its still finishing the final touches on decor but the food is definitely good! Went there for lunch and had their lunch special Pad Thai and Panang curry. Both delicious. Generous portions, very good price, definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Orange chicken was bland, service was terible. my family ate there on a Friday night, no other customers. Our drinks were empty and the watress never came by to refill."}
{"text":"Great food. Better for take out. Newly remodeled. Friendly people and awesome yellow curry and Pad Thai. The English is lacking and the bathrooms are a little dirty. Grading just the food and service there an excellent little secret Thai place. :)"}
{"text":"Their Thai iced tea went up from $1.50 to $3 in less than 5 days.  We got it to go on last week Thursday and got a decent size for $1.50.  We came back today (Tuesday) and the lady wanted to charge us $3 for the same size!  She said they changed the cup size, but if you compared the sizes it's only a few ounces more for double the price.  Such a ripoff!  Then on top of that, the woman had the nerve to roll her eyes just as she was turning around.  Very bad customer service."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place! The service is wonderful and the people are always amazing to us. The food is delicious, I'm always taking home left overs because the portions are big. Me and my family have been coming here for a couple years now!"}
{"text":"We just ate here last night for the first time.  We were both very happy with our Thai dinners.  Very yummy!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place! Love their papaya salad, flavor always on point. Their Tom Ka is delicious too especially when the have the jumbo shrimp, sometimes they don't. Hate the bowl the serve it in, although very cute, the soup spoon does not reach the bottom. Their Thai tea has free refills. The Pad se ew is amazing, large flat noodles with great flavor, not too sweet not too spicy."}
{"text":"For in home delivery, it was simply exceptional. The yellow curry with chicken was the f#&$&=#!ing bomb!! The Won Ton Soup was the best I have ever eaten. From the time I placed the order on Yelp24 App, the food was delivered hot, fresh and on a Sunday night with the Olympics on TV. 24 minute's!! They do it exceptionally well, Oh and by the way, the Chicken Wings may and I say may have been the best I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! Its cute, quaint, and the service always greets me with a smile. Once you walk in, you don't get a pungent smell of spices and sauces that make you feel dizzy. The food is a bit greasy for my taste, but it is what i expected for a friday night alone :) I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean establishment, and good food served quickly. They can cater to your spice level, so if you want it spicy just ask."}
{"text":"We just had delivery from them. Quickly delivered. The spicy Basil rice was very good, great Flavor. With stuffed chicken wings, sweet sauce with lots of vegitables. Pannang curry, and Kung pow chicken. Both excellent. Very generous portions. Not too expensive, very nice delivery guy. We will do this again. Try them, YUM!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Everyone is very friendly. The food is good. Their coconut-mushroom and chicken soup is amazing! Their num tok salad is sooooooooo good! I had a lunch special with orange chicken and so far has been the best orange chicken i had for a lunch special compared to other places."}
{"text":"This was a great Thai food experience. I had the Mussaman Curry and it was perfectly cooked, and there was a LOT of it. This place has HUGE PORTIONS. I had to (*got to) take most of my meal home with me and after trying to eat it for lunch the next day, I could barely finish it.  Also, they have free refills on the Thai Iced Tea."}
{"text":"This update is more a note to myself, but here's heads up for ya... Lunch specials, sure... but Vegetable Tofu Soup  just say no...   1. $7  for just a small bowl serving size for 5 pieces of tofu and a couple of broccoli and veggies thrown in.. feel ripped off here. [see pic  https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/N-HeX4E7vxWizjZDgpdyig/o.jpg]   2. The broth wasn't visually appealing.  Looked almost like dirty water...   3. Broth tasted like salty sweat.. blech!   no fun getting cramps and spending more time than usual on the toilet when you are already trying to recover from a cold and thought hot soup will help.   So next time, if there is ever a next time, if I ever check in here, remind me to pass up on the Vegetable Tofu Soup."}
{"text":"Chicken yellow curry was AWESOME... chicken pad thai was very yummy as well. my BF said that the mongolian beef was the best he had had in a while. will def go back!!!!"}
{"text":"I had it last night and it was so good I'm going back today. I usually don't eat the same thing two days straight but this is the exception.."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I love this place. Such a great deal with the lunch special--many choices to choose from for $6.95. The food is always consistent and great!  The service is always kind and prompt. I always get Pork Pad Thai that comes with Soup, salad and spring roll. I always skip the soup and ask for more salad.  If anyone figures out what delicious dressing they use on salads, I am all ears!!!  $7 minimum on credit cards, but if you pay with cash you get 10% off of your bill."}
{"text":"Well worth it! Three weeks ago, I had a hankering for some Thai food.  I ended up ordering from Gata, and was very pleased with the offerings: spicy eggplant and a beef dish.  As it was my first visit, I was fairly conservative with the spice level.  Today, I made my second visit.  As I am a heat freak, in all  important senses of the word, I ordered the mixed veggies and red curry on a \"9\" out of \"10\" scale.  The heat level was perfect, as were the two dishes.  I would give a nod to the very flavorful red curry.  I am very happy that this restaurant is within 10 minutes of my house.  I plan to order some egg rolls and salt/pepper chicken wings on my next trip.  Bonus: 10% for cash purchase."}
{"text":"Best pineapple fried rice I've had in Vegas.  I've ordered here three times and all three had consistent taste and spice levels.  Staff always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Oh my, oh my! I used to live on the other side of town and Archi's was my spot! My quest for a great Thai food place in Henderson is over, THIS IS WHERE TO GO!!! Their panang curry is amazing. They prepare it differently than every other Thai place I've eaten at. I can't quite figure out what it is, but their version has set a new standard for me. I also had their chicken pad thai, and that was solid as well. We received ten percent off for paying cash which was just the cherry on top for me. Gata Thai Cuisine gained themselves a new regular. :)"}
{"text":"I was in Henderson visiting a friend for his bday and I told him I would take him to lunch wherever he wanted. He said he wanted to go to Gata, because they have really good drunken noodles, so off we went. We were the only diners when we stopped in for lunch on this particular Saturday. I was happy to to learn they offer the lunch specials  7 days a week. I was also pleased to find out if you pay cash they take 10% off the bill. It just so happens I had cash on me that day. Sweet!  I ordered the sampler plate for us to start. It came with 2 of each: fried shrimp, cream cheese rangoon, egg roll, and fried wonton. My friend ordered the drunken noodles, and I opted for the pad thai shrimp lunch special. Since we were the only ones there, our food came out quickly. My meal came with a cup of soup on the side. I think it was wonton, but there were no wontons in it. It was actually quite bland. I asked for the pad thai to be a spice level 3, out of 10, and it was quite spicy. Next time I would probably ask for a 1 or a 2. I like to spice my own food, so that way if I make it too spicy, I have no one to blame but myself. Anyways the food was very good and if I am ever in the area I would go back.  Yelp 2015 Review #8"}
{"text":"Tasty chicken Pad Thai and the sweet and sour shrimp looked good too.  Glad I didn't choose the corner booth as there are molded leaky ceiling tiles and cracks and openings in others."}
{"text":"Super fast delivery and the food was amazing.  Warning though, unlike many other places that advertise spicy and leave your pallet flat, that will not happen here!  I may have to opt for medium spicy next time!  Everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"Made my order online through yelp. My order was ready exactly when it said it was going to be. I was treated so well the moment I walked into the doors. Food was great! Will return again for sure"}
{"text":"Ok ive been here before and was very happy ..dont know what happend to night ..open my order of orange chicken and it looked like someones leftovers... not happy and will not be back and i will post pictures ..they did put a huge orange on top.. but i paid over ten bucks for this and ive gotten more with lunch specials for 4.95 with soup eggroll and rice and tea and a cookie ..."}
{"text":"This place is so good we really enjoy this restaurant they have lunch specials includes soup and the main dish also Thai tea has refill what a gem we love Gata Thai"}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from here a number of times. Every time the food is hot and fresh. The delivery driver is always so friendly as well. The food is delicious and prompt. Definitely a good delivery option for those lazy days when you just don't want to cook."}
{"text":"This place was so great! First, if you check in on yelp, you get a free Thai tea. Sold! I loved it and they gave free refills while dining in. We tried the sampler appetizer plate. All pretty good but all fried. I had the lunch portion of Panang curry with shrimp. It was very tasty. My husband had Tom yum soup and the volcano chicken and he liked them both. I will say the salad dressing was lacking on the lunch plate but everything else was amazing!"}
{"text":"I hate to give it a one star because everyone else ordered bomb food but holy damn that was the worst Tom kha I've ever had. I sadly ended up having to mooch off my friends dinner. They ordered great pad Thai and crab ragoons were divine. Let's get back to my Tom kha yuck!!! Mushrooms were undercooked and chicken was beyond slimey. You can tell they rushed to make it because I got there early to pick up. I was in no hurry and even if I was you should never sacrifice the quality of the food for anything! Wah"}
{"text":"Interesting little place.  It has been here for as long as I can remember and yet I have never been here.  Decided to check it out with my friend who has been here a few times and I'm glad I did!  The food was tasty and pretty cheap although I wish there would've been more!  If I remember correctly, I got the yellow curry meal.  Came with rice, salad, yellow curry, and an egg roll with sweet sauce.  Everything was good, surprisingly good.  I want to go back and try more items but I just never think about it.  Maybe this review will wake me up a bit!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today and both ordered their lunch special. We both had the red curry and it was excellent! I was very surprised on the quality of the food, it was delicious.    We ordered the lunch special,  which comes with soup of the day (today was Tom yum), rice, eggroll, salad and the main choice (vegetable red curry). We also ordered a Thai tea, and thai coffee. Everything was prepaired very good, the service was spot on.  The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 stars is because the location and parking lot was kind of hard to get to, and a garbage truck was parked out in front of the restaurant for over 20 minutes because the driver was in the gas station next door.  This is a great restaurant, I would recommend going here. It's a great find, I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"They dont answer the phone. You'll be lucky if they pick up even half the time. Thailicious has muchhh better pad thai and pad see ewe along with better lunch special deals anyway. Won't be coming here anymore. The workers and delivery drivers have all been rude. Meh."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food in Henderson. I love their basil fried rice plus you get 10% off if you pay cash!"}
{"text":"One of the only reasons I sometimes go back to this restaurant is because they give you a 10% discount if you pay in cash. I asked the lady cashier why the discount and she said because the owners do not pay taxes on cash tickets. Wow. Can't believe she said that. Another reason to go back is because they give you a large portion of food."}
{"text":"Easy, convenient and flavorful! I like that I can order through yelp and pick up fast. Waiter and waitresses are always so friendly too My go to entrees are pad thai and combination fried rice ! You have to get both spicy! Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food and the staff are so friendly. Our family has multiple food allergies and they were so accommodating. We needed gluten free, sulfite free and no msg and they made it happen with a smile.  No negative allergic reactions to the food so we'll definitely be back!! Great to find a place where we can trust the kitchen staff to follow through on what the hostess and wait staff says that they will do! Plus... It's yummy!!"}
{"text":"I always do take out. The staff is realllllly friendly and generous (they even know my name and i was short 4 cents once) i always feel so good coming out of here. I have tried the spicy eggplant, pad thai, Pineapple fried rice so far. The portions are pretty large and price is reasonable! Here's a photo of the spicy eggplant: also, i always ask for the eggplant to be cooked all the way because the first time i got it it was pretty solid ( dunno if thats the way they cook it here normally, so i always ask just in case)."}
{"text":"My favorite is the thai bbq chicken & combination rice. Just moved out here from los angeles and was looking for good food nearby. This meets my standards :)"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from here a few times now and it has been delicious each time. My family and friends have loved it and some were new to Thai food. Noodle dishes are phenomenal, the pineapple fried rice is awesome, and really I haven't had anything that I don't like! Delivery times are usually an hour plus around dinner so keep that in mind. The only negative thing that I have to say is that the mango sticky is not nearly as good as Plumeria Thai on the west side or a couple of other places that I've been."}
{"text":"Food was great ! I especially enjoyed  the laos style papaya salad it had great flavor and crunch! The eggs rolls were good as well fresh and flavorful ."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered pick up and were happily surprised. We both ordered seperrated curries (my wife got massaman, I got yellow) and they lasted us for 4 sepetate meals! It's a lot of curry. It was a little pricey but for lasting us for so long it was worth the price. We also got coconut ice cream with chunks of pineapple. It's not on the menu but you can request it. They have other flavored but I've forgotten then."}
{"text":"My husband and I love curry, and most recently we have been going through a Masaman curry phase. We ordered Masaman curry here at a spice level of 7. It should be noted, I'm half Hispanic and I love spicy items. However, it was not as spicy as I would have thought for a 7. I read another review where someone had a spice level of 4, and it was too spicy for his wife. Anyways, the curry was just \"alright.\" The beef and broccoli dish was much better, but not the best I've ever had. I used to live in henderson, but I'm still not sure of other Thai places around, so I really can't compare the quality of it against it to other places here. The place has decent prices, and if you bring cash, you get a 10% off discount!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My first order was due to the fact that it was close, and they delivered...but I quickly fell in love with the food here. For someone who is OBSESSED with foreign cuisine it can be hard living in Vegas but this was such a good find!  The spice levels are true to spice haha and the staff there is so friendly...Cin is awesome! Our interactions are brief but he is always so cordial and I even ran into him at the gas station next door and he was very polite then.  My favorite things on their menu is their fried rangoons, shrimp pad kee mow, and beef pad see ew! So yummy!"}
{"text":"Chow mein with Shrimp is mighty  deelicious! Green curry amazing as always! Egg rolls are perfect! Crab rangoons bomb bomb!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery through the Grubhub app. The food arrived sooner than the estimate and was warm and fresh. We ordered Tom Kah soup, Num Tak salad, sticky rice, and Singapore noodles. The soup had a reasonable portion not shrimp as did the Singapore noodles. The salad was delicious and made with fresh basil. I will order from them again!"}
{"text":"*Free Thai Iced Tea refills!*  In a galaxy far, far away is Gata Thai Cuisine.  I made it out there for work, so took the opportunity to give this one a try!  I was pleasantly surprised.  When they brought me a small cup of Tom Kha for the lunch special, I knew this was going to be an enjoyable experience!  The Tom Kha, although not heavily spiced, had a very nice balance between sweet, sour, and savory.    I ordered the Crab Fried Rice and the Green Curry lunch special with beef.  The Crab Fried Rice was prepared in the traditional way with shreds of crab cooked into the rice.  It was light and fluffy, no extra grease at all!  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  My only complaint was the lack of Prik Nam Pla (fish sauce with chilies).  Regular fish sauce had to do.  Regardless, this place does an excellent fried rice!  My green curry was pretty good.  It was a lot thicker than I am used to, probably thickened up to appeal to white guys like me.  I ordered it a 7/10 spice level, and it had a decent kick to it.  Without that heat though, this curry would probably be a little bland.  It came accompanied with usual green/red bell peppers and bamboo, along with small chunks of nicely tender beef.  Solid green curry, but get it spicy.    The lunch special Green Curry came with a noteworthy veggie egg roll.  Meager, but delicious it was lightly glazed with the perfect amount of sweet and sour sauce.  For such a small item, care was taken to achieve a great balanced flavor!   The service was extra nice, although English wasn't a primary language in this place.  A friendly Thai customer helped me ask for my fish sauce.  Fairly authentic, and extra care taken with the food preparation, this is a Thai restaurant I would go back to if I lived in the area.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I used to live closer, and would go a lot more often. Their lunch specials are a great deal. My favorites are the pad thai, drunken noodles, and yellow curry."}
{"text":"I just want to make note that I did not dine in.  My experience doing take out was fast and easy!  Less than 15 mins for my food (I had the Yellow Curry) , it tasted amazing!  I do have to add very cheap and great quantity of food!  You'll get 10% off of your order if you pay cash so have your money ready!"}
{"text":"Very good thai food. I've been wanting to try it for a while because it's close to my house. Normally we only do nice thai restaurants. Not that this is a hole in the wall but it is smaller. Anyway great food and great service. We will be back. P.s i asked for a 3,4, and 5 on the spice level. That was hot as hell on the 4 and 5 they don't mess around it's legit spicy. But i love spice"}
{"text":"Everything here is AMAZING  I live in the apartment complex across the street and it's my GO TO for any meal at any time of the day... in this price range Gata Thai is the best thai food in the city. Their Lunch Special pricing is unmatched anywhere.   My favorites are Beef Broccoli, Volcano Chicken (not as spicy as you'd think) and Garlic Short Ribs! Also shout out to the Thai Beef Jerky, soooo tasty!!"}
{"text":"Food is great, and so are the people! Calling in for a carry out is a great option for on the way home from work."}
{"text":"Thai food is excellent! Basil / mint chicken, masaman and Pad Thai all great. Chinese food is good too."}
{"text":"Food was bomb for being hidden away...my friend told me it was real good, & she was sure rt will be bk for sure"}
{"text":"Gata Thai  First off, thank you for taking the time to present my food to me in a beautiful well plated manner.  Gata Thai has a great lunch special at about $7.00-$10.00 which included soup, salad, egg roll and your main dish either veggie, pork,chicken or beef. I eat chicken about once only a week and today was my day for that!!! The soup offered by Gata came out full of Veggies. Which was a plus only downside for (Me) the broth contained fish sauce and this killed the entire game for me, for some reason it's taste Over powers everything for me and I mean everything! So with that being said I ordered a Thai tea that came out large and full of flavor, great value and size for Thai tea at Gata, I think it kind of did the job I needed it to with cleaning my palette. The main dish came out wow!!! It came with rice, salad and my yummy egg roll all taste great and my main meal of basil chicken, now this dish was over sauced but full of flavor, I would ask for less sauce on the chicken next time, this dish also came with red and green peppers as well as basil everywhere, I would try this restaurant again! I was a little out of sorts after my soup but I still believe I had a great experience at this restaurant, great food and great prices."}
{"text":"Ordered the Beef Pad Thai lunch special and was delicious.  Staff was very friendly from the moment I walked in their restaurant. Definitely recommend stopping by and eating here"}
{"text":"This was a surprise find. Kinda hidden . Very clean ... food tasted very good. I ordered a 4 and didn't seem that Spicey, next time I will order a 6."}
{"text":"Delicious food, always prepared quickly! I usually order online and can pick it up within the time it takes me to drive from my house to the restaurant. Love it!"}
{"text":"This place has damn good Thai food. Flavor all around and their Thai teas are perfect."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I was able to find this Thai restaurant. I only gave this place 4 stars because I only able to test one dish which was Pad Thai. Nonetheless, the Pad Thai was really delicious! Even my mom and grandma loved their Pad Thai and now we're planning to go back to try more of their food. We usually drive to Chinatown to get really good Thai food, but I'm glad I found this in the Henderson area.  TIPS:  * make sure to call in your order or else you will have to wait quite a while. They get a lot of take out orders so be sure to call instead of ordering in person.  * if you don't have cash, the minimum charge must be $7 in order for you to use card. * they give 10% discounts to customers that pay in cash"}
{"text":"I live so close to this place that I had to try it even though I was skeptical that a good thai place would be in my area. I ordered the chicken satay appetizer, yellow curry with chicken, and pad thai with shrimp. Overall, I enjoyed all of it. I love yellow curry and theirs was pretty good. Plenty of veggies and chicken and the number 3 spice had good flavor and not too hot.  I've had better pad thai, but Gata's is definitely passable for those lazy nights when you don't want to cook or drive far.  The satay was good too, especially with the peanut sauce.   I will come back here again whenever I'm ready for a lazy night in watching movies with my girl."}
{"text":"Real Thai food.  Hard to find in this town.  Lunch Specials are great and when you oreer a ten its got some good heat to it."}
{"text":"It's ok. It was my first time and usually I like to announce that it's my first time. But when I walked in and told him, he said, \"ok...\" That's it. Thought he would be more welcoming and offer to tell me about specials or something. It was 8:20 pm and I asked what time they closed and he said that the kitchen closes at 8:30 pm. Um...ok. So I ordered pad Thai, crab Rangoons and spicy basil. I took the food home and nothing had spice and it was just ok. I don't think I'll be back any time soon. Maybe they were having an off day."}
{"text":"WOW! Everything I ordered was delicious! Great food, Great service,  I was impressed and it was my first time here.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The worst Thai food in town. Served MISO soup for lunch. Seriously? It's THAI / Chinese restaurant not Japanese. My friend ordered orange chicken that tasted like they pour cold orange yam on top of hot chicken. I had pad Thai that was so watery. It's our first time here and probably won't come back."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I call at 8pm for delivery and they say no. Open until 9pm but too bad if you want delivery. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"We've lived in this area for 7 years and have never stopped by until this weekend. I regret not coming in sooner. The service was great, place is super clean, and the food was so delicious. It was freshly made, drinks were topped off immediately. But the food, omg! So bomb! We get our Chinese/ thai food from a place a place on horizon ridge, they just lost our business. Lol.... I will say that I'm bringing my friends and family here soon."}
{"text":"I've recently moved to Las Vegas and have been missing a best friend Cin ever since I left.   As I'm laying around my house waiting for furniture to be delivered I get a knock at the door and it's Gata Thai Food delivering 4 styrofoam plates filled with delicious signature dishes.   As I open the door in surprise the very friendly delivery guy kindly departed with a \"Please Enjoy the food!\" -- oh you have no idea!   But who sent this?   From miles away Cin had Gata deliver me a wonderful lunch of fried chicken, stuffed chicken, papaya salad and drunken noodles.   Hands down, the drunken noodles were so delicious I ate the entire serving in one sitting! It was the right amount of spicy, the right amount of noodles-to-beef ratio and the right amount of love poured into making this dish! I dreamt about it last night! Fields of drunken noodles dancing happily into my mouth!   The fried chicken was seasoned to perfection! Although not crunchy, because it was in a container, you can tell if ordered fresh this would be even more tasty with a little bit of crunch. The papaya salad added just the hint of freshness to the pile with enough seasoning to make your mouth water for more. And lastly, the stuffed fried chicken, filled with noodles veggies and meats all Coates in a crunchy batter was absolutely Devine.   I'm so happy to have this place near me! Looking forward to more drunken noodles in my near future in my new environment!   Thanks Cin! And Gata!"}
{"text":"Pretty Good Thai Place!   Ordered the Chicken Pad Kee Mao & Mangolian Beef with White Rice for dinner and it was YUMMY!   Chicken Pad Kee Mao: I always hesitate to order Chicken because majority of the restaurant make it too dry. But luckily, this place made it just right. The noodles were tasty and perfectly flavored. It was not drenched in oil, which is a plus. I highly recommend this dish.   The Mangolian Beef was good. They gave a big portion, covered with lots of beef. So, my husband enjoyed it a lot. We were able to pack the extra for home.   We would definitely come back to this place. The prices are reasonable, 2 plates for $23.00 includes tip. Maybe, come back for their lunch menu, which I believe is $7.95.   This place is so much better than Naga (which is on Horizon). I'm surprised it's not as busy, but I'm sure if they keep up with the tasty dishes, more people will slowly know this is the place to eat. Come to Gata Thai, you will not regret!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a change of pace.  That's exactly what we got.  We ordered War Won Ton soup, the Appetizer Plate and the Pak Tho (sp) soup.  Everything was wonderful.  The young man who served us was extremely polite and helpful.  As full and happy as we are, we already plan to return to Gata Thai."}
{"text":"WHEN IN VEGAS...  If you... 1) Have drunchies 2) Are off the strip 3) Want food delivered to you PRONTO.  Gata Thai Cuisine gets the job done.  So post-dayclub partying in vegas, I usually have a couple questions, 1) where am I? 2) what day is it? 3) why am I so hungry and most importantly 4) WHAT ARE WE EATING or else I'll devour everything in sight. A crowd of us were extremely partied out and heading back home, and per reviews and comparison to the other delivery options, we chose to order delivery from Gata Thai.  We ordered the following and they were all really good! --Hot and sour soup --Pad thai --Pad See Ew --Orange Chicken --Beef and Broccoli  Delivery took 40 minutes and food was hot and fresh. Needless to say, we killed all of it."}
{"text":"The food was authentic and the pad thai had great flavor! HOWEVER, be careful when ordering the lunch special noodle dishes like pad thai because we got a side of rice in it when noodles don't come to rice. We ended up only getting half the amount of pad thai. Everything else was great though, just double check before ordering with them!  Went back again today 05/01/14 and ordered pad Thai and red curry with beef. Double checked to make sure the noodle didn't come with rice again. However, the curry turned out to be YELLOW curry with CHICKEN. What's the point of ordering if you can't get it right? Not coming back again."}
{"text":"I ordered Pad Thai and Thai tea via delivery. The lady over the phone was very nice and got my order correct. The delivery was on time, if not sooner. The food was warm, and the drinks were cold, however, the taste wasn't all that impressive. The tea tasted like pencil sharpenings, and the Pad Thai was overly seasoned. Maybe it was just my taste buds, but I just didn't like the flavor. The meal came with an egg roll, and it tasted spoiled. I'm giving it three stars because the service and the way they plate the food was good, but the taste...not so much."}
{"text":"SUMMARY: negative-1 stars for the appetizers | +3 stars for the curry BACKGROUND: Las Vegas is a foodie backwater, regardless of what people say about the \"fantastic food\" in Vegas. They're referring to high-end restaurants, with celebrity chefs, in Vegas proper. For the most part, food experiences outside the Strip---or true, rare anomalies elsewhere---you might as well be in East Podunk, Middle America, circa 1987.  HOW GATA THAI STACKS UP:  Even for the decidedly mediocre LV Valley, this is straight-up crappy, low-quality Thai food. For appetizers, my boyfriend and I ordered got crab rangoon, as well as wontons.  The Crab Rangoon was small, strange-textured, tightly folded, **greasy** puffy wontons, with what apparently was seasoned clay stuffed into it.   I've only had pan-fried wontons/dumplings at the many dozens of Thai restaurants over the years. These were called \"fried dumplings,\" but I just was not expecting literally fry-o-lator fried wontons, *dripping* with **grease**, fried within an inch of their lives, with tight nuggets of pork shrivelled into hard balls in the middle. We ended up tearing off most of the thick greasy wontons to eat the inside, which I pass on after 1, but my boyfriend scarfed down, and when he was done said \"Ugh. Yeah, that was bad.\" The green curry was actually pretty average curry. Not bad at all. 3 stars.  All the food was so salted so intensely your eyeballs almost dropped out, and the sauce was MSG Central. We're both jittery and pounding water now. Not the \"treat night\" we were hoping for."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend it... I came here twice right after their posted opening time and the doors were locked and no one came to the door. My third time I tried to eat here, they were actually open. I got the beef and broccoli and it was very oily and not the best taste. I would prefer just about anywhere else, then going to place again."}
{"text":"Gata have it! Try the Gata Rice. Or the Basil Chicken. Or the... everything! The shrimp rolls were the only thing I wouldn't order again. If you like spicy, ask for some Thai Chilis in fish sauce on the side.   My repeat order is always Gata Rice. Crazy good, my new comfort food.  So.  Freakin.  Great."}
{"text":"Old rice. Weird curry. Who puts hot curry in flimsy plastic? I have panang curry all of the time. Its supposed to be creamy and NOT grainy. Also, I ask for 2 out of 10 and it's hella spicy. Unhappy camper."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Fata Thai. I usually order tgeir beef salad and either a lemongrass soup or a seafoid soup. I also happen to people one of those weird people who is allergic to spicey food. Gata Thai always adheres to that dierary restriction without skimping on the flavor. They have even called to get clarification. I really appreciate this!  Thank You, Kaye"}
{"text":"Good selection of Thai and other Asian food. Restaurant is clean and the staff polite. Generous portions and free Thai tea refills!!! We go there 1 or 2 times a month and have not been disappointed. Try the musman or pan yang curry."}
{"text":"I keep trying and it's just not very good. Shrimp pad thai is a dense lumpy mass as it was from my previous visit. The plastic fork they provide just isn't strong enough to lift any noodles from this blob. They give you just enough shrimp to remind you It's a shrimp dish. A full order is a lot, but if it's not tasty, what good is it? I \"Gatta\" stop eating here. I wish it was better."}
{"text":"The lunch special is a really great deal, pad Thai and Thai tea are amazing. Great customer service as well!!"}
{"text":"No need for fancy clothes. Ain't nobody got THAI for that. If you're hanging around Henderson and looking for a casual, appe-THAI-zing place to grab lunch, Gata Thai is a good option to THAI on for size. Don't worry, the puns stop here.  Their lunch special is from 11a-3p and a steal at $6.95. Included items: soup, salad, egg roll, and steamed rice (except on noodle dishes). I was sad to see no pad see ew is offered as a lunch special, so I went with pad thai. Honestly, it was a little too sweet for me. The service was friendly though and decor was just enough for a pleasant vibe, so I'll come back to try another dish.  Bonus: Free thai iced tea with yelp check-in! Another bonus: 10% off if you pay with cash.   Win-win."}
{"text":"This place is just your average Thai restaurant. You may be wondering why I would frequent a place like this, but the only reason is because of the convenience and proximity. If Naga or Thai Bistro and Bar were closer, I would definitely choose them over this place.   I've tried a bunch of their food ranging from their lunch specials to a la carte items. If you do end up deciding to go here, I would get something like the panang or the massaman curry. I do have to note that their curries (along with their other food) are hit or misses. I'm not sure why the quality is not consistent because the curry would be decent at times and there are times when you can tell there isn't much spices and flavor. One of my worse experiences was when I ordered the yellow curry and the only flavor I could taste was spiciness and I even requested a 3/10 lol.   Their lunch specials are alright. It comes with a small vegetable egg roll and a bowl of soup. Can't really complain much since it only costs like $6-7, but if you are willing to spend $1-2 more at another place, I am sure you can get better quality and quantity.   Overall, I would not really recommend going here unless you are in the area and refuse to drive about 5 minutes more to Penn's Thai House. The food is just decent and there usually isn't that many people dining in so just get take out!"}
{"text":"I came here based on the reviews, but was severely disappointed.  I ordered a simple lunch special and it took nearly 20 minutes to get.  When I got back to work it was a mess.  My eggroll was so under fried that the middle was raw and cold inside, the salad is just lettuce with half a teaspoon (if that much) of flavorless dressing and the entree was a joke.  Minimal flavor at best, totally dried out noodles and zero \"thai\" essence.  I could have made the same thing with top ramen noodles.  Should have trusted my gut and went to my usual place instead.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Food has gone down since the last time we ordered. Order was similar to last time, since we know it tasted decent.  -Penang Curry with Pork: Same as prior, good. -Tom Yum Kha: Was spicier than last, but flavor was on point.  The only thing I don't enjoy are the mushrooms in the soup still look a bit...dirty.  When I eat the soup, I am chomping down on some dirt or something. -Pad See Ew Beef: My favorite noodle dish...unfortunately, this time was a total failure.  Both my husband and I can taste a 'bamboo shoots' flavor in this dish.  They must have cooked a Chinese dish that included bamboo shoots and did not wash the wok, and decided to cook pad see ew.  Damn it!  That messed up the dish for me.  We have decided to drive the distance and get food from Pin Kaow."}
{"text":"Delicious food - I love the yellow curry!  Also, the delivery service is very, VERY fast and friendly. Definitely a regular!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here for the first time and I must say everything we had was very good. Started with the won ton appetizer and they had incredible flavor, followed that with hot and sour soup which was not to spicy and had an accent of cilantro. Next we had the cashew chicken and chicken chow mein both well seasoned and loaded with tons of chicken. A little on the pricey side but we'll worth it."}
{"text":"WAS pretty good, now it's pretty bad, food tastes like nothing, i had to put salt on it, (i never use salt) did they change owners?...Blah"}
{"text":"Nice customer service, but food is a bit on the salty side especially for the pad see ew and their beef noodle soup."}
{"text":"Great place.   I have come back to this restaurant many times for lunch.  They have great lunch specials and the food is quickly prepared and is delicious."}
{"text":"Great food!!!!! Tried their pad Thai and it was delicious and affordable. Brought a friend and they enjoyed it too!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here at least a dozen times. Food is usually pretty good. Their basil chicken is one of my favorites. Got the food to go yesterday and everything looked appealing. The pad see ewe was good. The basil chicken was good. The beef fried rice was good. Only problem was the fried chicken wings.   I ordered the fried chicken wings with sweet chili sauce. The wings smelled like a dirty rag and did not taste good either. My son took one bite and gagged it out.  Not sure if they changed cooks or staff, but something was not quite right."}
{"text":"This place is just so delicious and they are as fast as they can be every time . Never had a problem , they are nice and the small place is cute and clean . Only gave 4 stars because they don't deliver to my address :("}
{"text":"Delicious food! Lunch special red curry with soup, salad, egg roll, and rice only $6.95!!! Thai iced tea with one refill - $3!! The kids had beef chow mein and shrimp fried rice - big shrimp too. We'll be coming back. The level of spice of the curry was good - a little heat - just the right amount. So full. So good."}
{"text":"A little hidden gem in a business plaza in Henderson!  I've come here several times in the past months to satisfy my recurring Thai cravings and I haven't been let down yet.   They have excellent lunch specials. $6.95 for a lunch portion of a select group of entrees/noodles/curries along with salad and an egg roll. Some of those entrees include pad thai, yellow curry, orange chick, spicy eggplant, etc. You get the picture.  The regular ala carte menus are also very reasonable in price. I've tried the pad thai and pad see ew which are always a safe Thai staple. I've also gotten the yellow and panang curries with chicken. They come with a portion of rice for the curries as well. Very good food and friendly service all the times that I've been there.   It's also super convenient for me since I live close by, but they also deliver so there's no excuse!   TIP: They have a 10% discount if you pay in cash for your meal!"}
{"text":"It's my second time here and I have tried different dishes: Pad Thai, Fried fish with black pepper sauce, and Thai beef jerky. The pad Thai and Thai beef jerky were pretty good although I've had better tasting ones in other places. The fried fish with place pepper sauce is the bomb though! Portions were huge and prices were pretty decent. The place was also cleaner than most Thai places I've been to. Service was so-so but it is understandable because there was only was person serving, taking orders, and seating guests. I will definitely come back. This is usually my go to place while waiting for my car to be serviced."}
{"text":"Never disappoint! Order their basil fried rice, lettuce wrap and pad Thai. Nice genuine lady is always there!"}
{"text":"After a play off Water Street in Henderson, I stopped here for dinner.  I had intended on getting something in the curry line but I ended up getting Singapore Noodles.  Although it has curry too, it's more Chinese than Thai.  I was the only sit down customer.  Three people came for take out while I was here.  I was told to sit anywhere and the server immediately brought me a glass of water and I ordered a Thai iced coffee which was very refreshing.  The Singapore noodles were quite nice.  A fair serving size, there were five shrimp and a good amount of pork along with vegetables.  The curry was very flavorful and gave the noodles a nice, semi-spicy flavor.  This was one of the better places that I've had Singapore noodles.  It's a shame this is on the other side of the valley from where I live.  If it were closer I'd be back to try some other items."}
{"text":"If you are able to come here during lunch hours, you will not be disappointed. For just $7 you get a huge plate of amazing. I'm always particular to yellow curry and it was outstanding. Good, friendly service too."}
{"text":"This place is insanely good! We have been looking for a good Thai place close to home and this place is it. WOW! My hubby had the Spicy Basil with chicken and I had the Green Curry with tofu. Both were cooked perfectly. The flavor was intense and full bodied, perfectly spicy too. This restaurant occupies the space of a Chinese place we used to love, and I couldn't be happier that something just add good took its place. We can't wait to eat here again. Also we ordered our food to go and we were in and out in less than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Always super quick and really nice. They do a discount if you use cash but they take PayPal as well which is nice. Glad they do take out but dining in is nice to. We will for sure be back and do take out again. The curry is great and the crab Rangoon is amazing"}
{"text":"Okay this is my go-to thai place. It's close quick convenient and the food is amazing. Friendly delivery and it's always quick. Food- I love the pad Thai, pan nang curry, vegetable soup, cucumber salad, and the have the best Rangoon's! I have eaten here over twenty times and am never disappointed. It's the food I get when I want something that I know will be good."}
{"text":"I came in for a late lunch and had the place to myself. The food was excellent and the service was wonderful. Recommended."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Especially the red curry. Will definitely come again for Thai food :)"}
{"text":"Found Gata by chance last night and decided to give it a try.  The first impression was that of a fast food place.  Very simple seating nothing special about the decor. The waitress was very nice and seemed helpful to everyone although she was the only one. (Service was still timely). I was pleasantly surprised by the food. The Gata rice is definitely worth it and the portion was enough for two.  The drunken noodles were equally tasty. I would definitely go back just based on the dishes alone especially for the area."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout twice and not good. Doesn't have authentic Thai flavor.   Thai Iced Coffee is gross.   Save your time and cash, go elsewhere ~"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for curry last night and Indian food is not too easy to find in Henderson.  I gave Gata Thai Cuisine a try just to go somewhere new.  It may be a different type of curry but Thai curry is awesome too.  Gata Thai is a small restaurant and none too fancy.  But it is a cute little place with a lot of Thai decor and Buddah eveywhere.  Its a pleasent enough place to dine in but most orders seemed to be take-out.  Either phoned in orders or walk-ins for the most part.  I was greeted fast and friendly as soon as I walked in and told I could sit anywhere.  As soon as the man at the front was done taking the order he was working on he brought me a menu and took my drink order.  I just wanted a water and that was brought out quickly too.  After a few minutes of looking over the menu and debating the attractiveness of each of the curries I settled upon massaman curry.  It came to my table within just a few minutes.  The curry was good.  Peanut butter richness.  Coconut sweetness.  A little spice.  Tender chicken, solid chunks of potato, onions and topped with peanuts.  It was warm and soothing on what was kind of a cool night.  My only complaint with the meal was that I was not given much rice.  Only about half the amount of rice compared to the amount of curry.  Not that I needed anymore rice.  Potato and rice equals starch on starch.  No worries.  I was just going to take the left over curry home and have it on rice the next day.  I've done that in the past at other Thai places because I usually have the same complaint about not enough rice.  So there I sat waiting for my opportunity to ask for a to-go box.  And I waited.  And waited.  There was only one person working the front.  One person to man the cash register, the phone and the dining room.  He never got a break.  The phone kept ringing.  Customers kept walking in to either pick-up or place orders.  I sat for over 10 minutes waiting for him to walk by.  I finally gave up and ate the rest of my curry with out the joy of rice to soak up the sauce.  Next thing I know it is another 10 minutes later and he finally had the opportunity to tend to the dining room.  I had already pushed my plate away from me and he asked if I was finished. I answered that I was and a few moments later I had my check.  I was getting restless waiting. I'm not the most patient person.  Not that I blame him for taking too long.  He can't help how busy they are.  But it is frustrating to be sitting in wait just for the chance to go home."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. I had a pleasant experience. I give it a 5 because they jam pack your entrees with whatever meat selection you choice, and they use real Chinese broccoli!  Not the best thai food I've have, but worth it considering the distance from my house. I cannot promise you though if they are msg free. But they give you free thai tea refills. That alone is worth a 5 in my book."}
{"text":"I have ordered takeout from here twice. The red curry and the pad see ew were tasty, but the beef salad and tom kha were average. They are reasonably priced and orders are ready when promised. The gentleman at the front counter is very nice. I will order from here again."}
{"text":"Orange chicken is ORANGE. There was so much food coloring on the chicken it looked like it was made of play-doh. It was okay, but I've had better orange chicken at the fast food chain that made it famous.  Pad Thai: SO oily. I could feel the grease accumulating on my face. However, the portion was huge so it's hard to complain."}
{"text":"Love Gata !! When we lived in henderson this was our go to place for Thai! They always had the order ready to go when we got there and the employees are always nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. We did take out and I have tried many Thai places in Henderson, and this is the best. The pad Thai, pad see ewe and duck and chicken were great. The Singapore noodles and curry was good too! Definitely worth trying, and we got a lot of food for the price"}
{"text":"Always fresh. The best I've had in Henderson/Vegas area yet! Plus they deliver to us almost in Lake Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've always driven past Gata on my way home for months, so I tried ordering take out. I got pad thai with chicken, green curry with chicken, and a thai iced tea. The pad thai wasn't anything special, and it's something that you can get at any other thai restaurant. The green curry was why I decided to give it 4 stars. It was flavorful and they give you a generous amount of curry with the takeout portions. The thai iced tea was a little on the sweeter side, but it's not like some other places where they water it down or it tastes like all milk. Gata's thai iced tea is flavorful and you can actually taste the tea.    TLDR- I come back for the green curry and thai iced tea. They're both really great."}
{"text":"The food is good! I love their glass noodles, and I love that I can choose the level of spice I want, since most places I go to do not make me the spiciness I am looking for in a Thai dish. I do like that they offer 10% off if you pay with cash. My biggest complaint is the wait times, they are outrageous, especially for not being overly crowded or busy with to-go orders. On a Sunday night, I went in pretty late in the evening, and by the time I ordered it on the phone, drove there, and waited for the food it was almost an hour later. The woman at the counter suggested I go run some errands and come back? Not my favorite type of service. Will be back because it's close and yummy, but step up the speed! I ordered from here via Yelp the other night and that was suuuuuper nice!"}
{"text":"I ordered take-out through GrubHub from Gata Thai and was very impressed with my food. I'll definitely be ordering from here next time I have a Thai food craving.   The Peppers Steak was my favorite with really flavorful steak and a nice amount of peppers and onions mixed in. The sauce on the dish was delicious. The crispy wontons on top were tasty with the dish. The Pad Thai was also delicious and the chicken in the dish was good too.   Everything was packaged well and a sizeable portion. Prices were similar to other Thai restaurants in the area. Ordering through Grubhub was easy and the food was at my house in an hour."}
{"text":"Ordered take out again and got the Pad-See-Ewe Beef and the Green Curry with Chicken again, both mild spice and they were perfect! The food is actually really good here in my opinion compared to a lot of other thai food places in the area.  My three star review is because I ordered through the EAT yelp app and 1) the driver could not find my apartment even though I gave him specific directions and made me come out to the street to get my order and 2) the driver/delivery man was very rude and said \"you know our kitchen closes at 830, this will be the last time we bring food to you...\" I'm sorry but I would assume that if I order food through an app that you are a part of and it is past the time that you would cook/deliver it that it would be a good business practice to call the person and apologize and let them know that the kitchen is closed... NOT my fault you don't have common sense - your rude manner just cost you a customer :("}
{"text":"I'm in Vegas and wanted to go to the Thai place that Anthony Bourdain reviewed on No Reservations. While preparing to go there reading the Yelp reviews, I found this place Highly rated and recommended in the reviews, it was only 6 minutes from my sisters house so I decided to come here instead.  We arrived at 11 am and was 2nd to be seated. The place was nice and 70 degrees well decorated and new and clean feeling.  I don't eat Thai food so I went off the reviews to choose, I chose Drunken Noodles  Pad Kee Mao with pork and level 7 spice.  I loved it! Tasted and looked like what I would expect if and when I travel to Thailand.  I checked in and received a free Thai Tea and paid cash received a 10% discount and left 20%."}
{"text":"Second time here and just as good as the first- everyone should check this place out!"}
{"text":"Showed up this place 40 minutes before they closed and they asked us to order to go because they were closing. When we looked at them confused and asked if they closed at 9 pm like their website and yelp state the server said \"fine, can you just sit here? I just moped the floor\". We left. We didn't feel welcomed and it definitely was not a good first impression. We will never go back. They obviously rather get off at 9pm than to make new costumers."}
{"text":"Food is good in this place. I love the Gata Fried Rice in particular with chicken strips, beef, pork barbecue and shrimps. The rice is garnish with cashew nuts, pineapple chunks and cilantro. The price is very reasonable too. I highly recommend this place to anyone. Me and my partner eat here at least 2x a week."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Have ordered from them multiple times and they never disappoint! Prices are fair and reasonable. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials! 8$ and im full. I love the Tom yum and curry  nice service too. Pay with cash and get 10% off too#"}
{"text":"You Gata go there! Really, great food and staff! Try the beef boat noodles with extra meatballs! The Tom Yum noodles are good too, like to save the broth to go and add some shrimps next day for another meal! If you are into fried rice, try the Gata fried rice, it's a combo of flavorful meats and I normally ask for no cashews.   It's a bit of a smaller place and gets busy during the lunch specials.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place has so much potential.Beau  is a chef and a little picky with food and so as I,maybe because i love trying out new restaurants.I only gave it 4 stars just because of how the ambiance doesnt justify the food quality. But anyway I had beef Pad see Ew,loved it.a little oily,i would admit that i can compare it with others i tried,but i would still give it 4 stars.we also tried beef with broccoli,my  boys 7 and 4 years old loved it so as the orange chicken.My husband ordered yellow curry with chicken and we finished it all.real good.but like i said theyre comparable to other thai i tried,but i would still give them this review to justify oir experience. Clean restroom,enough parking spaces,nice workers. Would come back."}
{"text":"Great food. Be careful when asking for spice lol they don't mess around, but I love it"}
{"text":"This place has solid inexpensive thai food and is fast for take out. I had the pad thai lunch special that was $6.95 (they give 10% off if you pay cash) and it included an egg roll and salad (soup is included too if you dine in). Great large portions, I couldn't even finish it all in one sitting. The pad thai had a hint of curry flavor that I have never tasted in pad thai before, but it was still good. I will definitely return to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've eaten here. Before this was called wok in. Great food and owner was amazing. This here is a complete and utter dissapointment. The food lacks everything decent. Orange chicken well over cooked. The pad Thai flavorless. The Singapore noodle flavorless and lacking most if the ingredients that you expect to find in this dish. 2 stars is being nice and giving this establishment a chance.. But or now, I'll stick with the place that sells dumplings that are little off of Stephanie and horizon."}
{"text":"This is a little local spot that whips up some great Thai food.  I tried the beef nam tok cause the picture looked amazing.  I chose a spice level of 4 out of 10 and that definitely had a kick.  I also tried the beef pad see ewe (spelling?) and that was also delicious.  A few weeks later I picked up chicken pad Thai, spicy beef basil,  pork larb and Thai ice tea.  My family loved the food. Spice was just enough for us to enjoy.  Not salty or greasy at all.  The Thai teas were perfect. Not super dark so it wasn't sweet.  This place also provides a discount if you pay cash."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place literally hundreds of times but never tried it. Today my grandchild and I went to Naga to find it closed, so this place being nearby we decided to try it. Estheticly it's nothing special, the staff was attentive and friendly.  I ordered the drunken noodles (level 7) and my grandchild ordered the Pad Thai. The food came quickly and the first thing we noticed was that it looked good, which might sound strange but I can't think of another way to put it. And it tasted as good as it looked, my noodle dish was perfect and my grandchild said it was the best Pad Thai he ever had!!       Of course this is based on a single visit but right now I plan to try this place again and I regret all the times I just drove by!!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened a few years ago, I tried it out, and it was not good at all. Thank goodness I give second chances cause I love his place now!  I probably order from here every other week or so. The panang curry with vegetables, spice level 5 is where it's at. I like it really creamy, but given the location and availability, this will make the cut.   They also have really good fried rice that's not too greasy and you can get it with shrimp or veggies, too. The portions are pretty large as well. I usually always end up with some for the next day to eat.   I also love coming here because they are friendly. If you order there and are waiting, they don't \"forget about you..\" They keep you updated while you're waiting.   I don't think you can go wrong with an order here. Not now anyway. And they are nice and quick."}
{"text":"Love this lil' Thai spot!! The food is delicious, I highly recommend their fried rice, papaya salad, pad se eww noodles, the yellow curry is great... The lady at the register is very friendly and they usually take less than 25 mins to cook your food. I'll def keep coming back to this restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Free Thai tea refills! This is our go to place. Family owned and delicious food. We love the tom ka soup and the mango sticky rice was delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here before so I knew that they were decent, but the last couple times very bad so disappointed.  I called today and I was ordering off the menu first a man answered and then a girl got on the phone I didn't know who I was speaking to, but anyways I ordered as the menu states, with the letter and the number, I didn't want to miss pronounce the name and screw up communication. So I ordered LIKE THEIR MENU SUGGESTS.... to be clear. Then the lady says well can you tell me what that is? because I don't have that menu in front of me that seems kinda odd? why wouldn't you know what L 1 is in your own restaurant?   Anyways I ordered pad thai lunch special a glass noodle dish fried rice & a combination soup seafood that states there'll be mushrooms catfish fresh basil mussels squid shrimp I ordered it 8 out of 10 it was not hot there was no catfish it was like mushroom soup fresh basil? not fresh this week anyway in the square I thought was baby corn and I can barely chew through it.   pad thai was so greasy the egg roll was mushy instead of giving you a side of sweet and sour the eggroll SAT in the sweet and sour the pad thai look like it was under a heat lamp and had a crust over top of it and oil in the bottom of it the lunch special with all in the same box so needless to say my mushy egg roll was sitting in sweet and sour sauce then hot lettuce drowned in dressing and my seafood soup that is $15 with tax was more like a mushroom broth terrible terrible terrible I couldn't believe it very hesitant to ever go back there again I do like the 10% off for cash so every little bit helps but I was so disappointed and the hottest  was not hot I ordered pad thai 10 out of 10. Not hot at all, the soup 8/10...not even 5"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Dishes were a bit too sweet for me, but they said they can adjust as requested. We had spicy eggplant with chicken & panang curry with chicken. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. I only take away a star because I've had orders incorrectly made. They have tried to fix it by giving me the next one free but I have to deal with the wrong order to begin with or this would be a 5 star easy. I recommend the Red curry with shrimp and the garlic chicken w/no cabbage. They also have pretty good pad se ewe with chicken just needs a bit more sauce so the noodles don't stick together so bad. Tastes great but it has to be eaten right away or the noodles get hard. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"get the pad woon sen. glass noodles are better that rice noodles. they dont swell up. youll love it"}
{"text":"If you don't see the native people's eating at the restaurants that bear the name of their homeland, first of all it's probably not authentic, second it's probably not that great of food. My first time trying this place, I walk in and there are Thai people working there and eating there. Right there you know it's at least decent food. I ordered the Pa' Naang chicken curry, my wife ordered chicken pad Thai. The curry was great and the pad Thai was a bit spicy for my wife, but good flavor, I ordered it spicy level 4 which I hoped it wasn't too spicy for her, but unfortunately it was.  Next time I know to order it without any spice for my wife. You should take it easy on the spice until you know what you can handle.   All said and done I will be eating here on a regular basis or until I have a bad experience. I definitely suggest this place if you like authentic Thai food!!"}
{"text":"I don't get all the positive reviews. Maybe I went there on an off day. I ordered a variety of dishes and everything tasted off to me. One dish was way too sweet, another tasted like the meat in it had gone bad. The potstickers had noodles in them which seemed odd. The competition in the area seems way better to me."}
{"text":"Asides the unlimited Thai Tea that should be standard.. Food is very tasty and will come back again.."}
{"text":"We are regulars here! Our favorite dishes are Green Curry, Chicken Larb and Pad Thai. My son loves their sticky rice. Clean, family restaurant, reasonable prices and prompt service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and ordered the pad Thai lunch special.  They have lunch specials from 11:00am-3:00pm (all week)  for 6.95/8.95 if you add shrimp.  It includes soup, salad, egg roll, and an entree. Good deal!  Will definitely come back to try more things on the menu.  Friendly staff :)."}
{"text":"First time ordering take out but my noodles had a funky taste, I ordered the tofu pad woon sen, egg was burnt so it gave the whole dish a rotten egg flavor . I literally spit the food into my napkin because I was surprised by the bad taste. I've never had a bad experience with Thai food , usually you cant go wrong but this place is not for me."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! We had the chicken fried rice and the sticky rice with coconut ice cream. Both were delicious. I ordered s Thai iced coffee and it was a little too sweet for me (I had never tried it before). Our server noticed and offered a different drink and even a to go cop as we were leaving. I would highly recommend this restaurant:-)"}
{"text":"I was super excited when I heard a new Thai spot had opened up in Henderson. After reading Shirley B's review on Yelp I knew we had to try this place.   They have an excellently priced lunch menu and if you pay cash you get 10% off. I always love a good deal.   Gata is a small sit down spot. The waitress is super friendly and on point. We both ordered off the lunch menu. I got the Red Beef Curry and Joel ordered the Pork Chow Mein. The soup that came with the meal was a little salty, but I liked the seaweed and little bits of tofu. Our food came out quickly and hot. The Red Beef Curry came in it's own bowl with a side of rice and a small salad. The salad dressing had a sweet lemon vinaigrette which was a bit to sweet for my liking. The Curry had a great spice ( It could have been spicier) but I really loved the overall flavor. The meat was tender and I was happy to discover they put lots of bamboo shoots in the dish. Joel devoured his Pork Chow Mein. It had crisp veggies and lots of meat. It too had good flavor.   I really enjoyed Gata Thai. I've been thinking about their Red Curry since we went. Plus, I'm currently on liquids for a while and I look forward to trying their soups. Another tasty spot has come to Henderson."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight and we were kind of worried because there was not many people in there and our recent experience at another Thai restaurant was unpleasant. In the end, we were glad we went in&gave it a shot.  Location: Kind of hidden, but not a big deal. Did not see a sign that could easily be seen from the road, but a bit of looking around with the help of directions, it wasn't bad.   Service: There was one waiter, probably because there was barely anyone there. Most people would come in for take out, only 2 other people were seated to eat in. He checked on us a lot and was quick to refill drinks and was always available when we needed something.   Food&Price: We ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai and Beef&Broccoli. Both dishes were really good and we would definitely order it again. Thai Tea was really good, not too sweet and not overly creamy. 2 dishes, a can of soda and the Thai tea (free refills) was $28 & some change. 10% off when you pay with cash, so it ended up being about $25.   We are looking forward to going back and trying other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Ordered red curry w/ beef, beef pad Thai, and two orders of mango sticky rice for pick-up. Both dishes were exactly what I'd expect. Nothing fancy, reasonably priced. I'd be willing to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"In my Henderson neighborhood my 3 favorite budget places to eat are Gata Thai, Manna Mediterranean and Village Pub.  Was here about 6 pm on Sun/31 May: 5-stars for:  - giving a 10% discount when paying with cash - free refills on Thai iced tea or iced coffee (when dining in) - $6.95 lunch specials being 7-days a week, I think 11 am - 3 pm (Le Thai and other places only do weekday lunch specials) - being open 7-days a week 11 am - 9 pm (Manna closes by 7 pm and is closed all day Sundays) - great food, great service (May, the cashier/waitress, was very attentive)"}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from my apartment complex. I am very picky about Thai food. I ordered the stuffed chicken wings and the poh-tak soup for pick up. I felt a little bad because I dn't decide I wanted Thai for dinner until an hour before closing. They were very quick with the food. My expectations were blown. They flavors were very good and as close to authentic as I can get here."}
{"text":"Can you say AWESOME!! My husband and I are normally Naga fans through and through but they couldn't deliver tonight so we were hesitant but ordered from here and OMG we are so glad we did! The good tasted fresh and not dried out from sitting. It was only a 30 minute wait time vs 60 and everything was still HOT!  Sorry Naga, we love you but we love Gata more!!"}
{"text":"Great service.. great food.. great lunch special even on weekends! Worth the trip from southern highlands to henderson!"}
{"text":"My husband and I order takeout from Gata probably every other week. Their service is efficient and their curry is fantastic. I often order the panang curry with chicken, and would highly recommend this dish! Great little spot for quick Thai."}
{"text":"Coming into an empty restaurant was a bit concerning but all of a sudden business came all at once. We started with shrimp rolls that turned out great and volcano chicken. The volcano chicken had good flavor to it. We will definitely come back again. I gave four stars as another couple ordered after us and was served first. By looks of it, they were regulars there."}
{"text":"This place just opened up a few weeks ago and is right in a part of town that I frequent. Right at 215 and Gibson in the Speedee Mart shopping center with Jack in the Box, Bistro Pizza etc, to name a few.    The menu offered a lot of great options and everything looked so good!  The lunch special for $6.95 included soup, entree, (and rice, unless u order a noodle entree like I did.), a small salad and egg roll.  I got the Pad Thai...  It was super tasty and hit the spot!  Think about it, most of us pay $7 or more for over-processed fast food burgers and stuff... Why not grab some delish, made to order Thai food instead?!!!?! ;)  The staff was so nice and inviting and the casual atmosphere made me feel comfy.  I will be returning very soon! Oh and btw, the egg rolls, I agree with the other reviewer, they are so good-I'd also stop in just to grab a to-go order of those!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and so happy I've found this Thai place. I have a few favorites by the airport where I work - but this is the next best thing for the Southeast Henderson Area.   The Tom Yum soup, all Curry dishes and Pad Thai is incredible. Spicy is spot on when requested for you heat lovers. The staff is on-point and if you pay cash you get an extra 10% off!   Great seating if you stay in but take out rocks as well. I frequent here often and can't wait to try my next dish! 5  all the way!"}
{"text":"Gotta have Gata Thai. This place pops out amazing food. To be fair I've only gotten take out so I don't know the service but I can vouch for their great food. I've never had the desire to eat there though and it could be because of the less than authentic feel or just it's location with windows looking at a Gas Station. Staff seems to be very nice though."}
{"text":"Papaya salad- too salty.   Egg Foo Yung- awesome! Large quantity and tasty.   Rangoons- They were ok but could have been fried more.  Duck- over priced, dry and too tough to chew bc it was overcooked, a burst of salt overdose!   Teriyaki chicken- Dry and did not taste like teriyaki.  Calamari- Too rubbery, not fried enough. Had to bake it longer when I came home.    Overall, this place does not taste like authentic Thai food. They don't cook their food well.  Customer service- average."}
{"text":"Food is always great. The staff is friendly and helpful. They always treat us like family.  The prices are really good too!  The Thai tea has free refills & it calms the spicy burn!"}
{"text":"Ordered pad thai and pad see ew. Delicious! Staff was friendly and they even were able to make our meal vegan friendly. Will definitely be back! Love that they give a discount if you pay cash as well."}
{"text":"Gata Thai is good, but it isn't our top option for Thai food. The location is convenient and the service is usually consistent. The owners recognize us and we will continue to support their business when we can. I think we just have better overall options.  Along with the convenience, other positives include lunch specials with good value, the ability to order take out or pickup with the easy to use Eat 24 app, and 10% off your bill if you pay cash.  I didn't really notice until my most recent visit that they put a wall up over the window that used to look into the kitchen which decreases some of the noise coming from the back of the house. The small restaurant seems to always be clean but occasionally, I do notice a smell. Service is consistently good because the restaurant isn't consistently full.  The menu consists of classic Thai dishes plus a stir fry section. We have had most of the menu over the last year they've been open and we really have not had a bad dish. We always order one of their curries and one of the larbs. For a good Thai meal with competitive prices, Gata Thai is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Close by, end of the evening, not cooking tonight so easy decision... Gata got my vote, it's not the best in the west buy it did the job for my Thai craving. Got the chx PT level 6, decent spice, crunchy sprouts, n fresh chx n noodles. I'm on a mission right now so not gonna bore u w further details. It's a cool little spot right off the highway, friendly and offers a discount for cash paying customers.. I'm good, \"we finished?? \" we done?\" Lol!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  I moved out of Vegas and I still miss this place.  You will not regret."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. It was quiet and there was plenty of room. The customer service is friendly."}
{"text":"Have gone here multiple times. Always have had great service and great food. My favorite dish on the menu is definitely the Pad Thai. Love to go for the lunch special from 11-3pm only 6.95 and with us paying cash we get 10% off. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here because I wanted some Tom Kha Gai and good Thai restaurants in Henderson are few and far between. I checked out Yelp for reviews on the place, and it was mixed. I decided to try it anyway.  We ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Pad Woonsen, and some Tom Kha Gai. The food came quickly and it was hot. The waitstaff were pleasant and helpful. The Pad Woonsen was pretty good, but not the best. I didn't even try the other dish because when I took a spoonful of my soup it tasted like I bit into a very dirty lime.  Now, Tom Kha Gai has lime juice. But it also has coconut milk. And chicken. And mushrooms. And it's NOT supposed to have dirt (I mean it - I chewed some!). It is supposed to be a refreshing taste, not something that instantly sours whatever is in your stomach. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this place.  Two stars for service. Zero stars for food."}
{"text":"Ordered the massaman curry. After a 20 minute wait in the empty restaurant, we received curry vaguely resembling massaman curry. Was missing the peanuts (best part?) and had an off taste.  I've had massaman curry here before and it tasted great, but not this time. The crab ragoons however are very good!"}
{"text":"Been driving past this little gem finally decided to stop in I had the schrimp pad thai so delicious and flavorful schrimp were plantiful."}
{"text":"My second favorite Thai place in Vegas/Hendo. The flavors are bold and authentic and the spice is on point. One way I can tell if a place is good is consistency and this place has it because I have tried the same dishes different times and it always tastes just as good. I have yet to try their curries or rice dishes yet, but my favorites are the pad key Mao (wider noodle dish) and chicken Thai basil (minced chicken in a delicious savory sauce enhanced with veggies and basil). I have caught their lunch for $6.95 with comes with a smaller portion of some item, small salad, and egg roll, but honestly I would've rather have paid the $2 more and gotten a full size . Great place . Discount if you use cash."}
{"text":"Love the quick, easy online ordering right from their yelp page! I placed my order within minutes and everything was ready at the time i specified. Convenience is always a plus!  Everything on the menu is decently priced, with the majority of items at $9.95.  I got the green curry (medium spice) and the spicy eggplant. While I chose \"spicy\" for the eggplant, I feel like it was more of a medium, as it was no spicier than the curry. Both dishes were very flavorful, and the portions were generous for the price. The curry especially went a long way, I just needed to make some extra rice at home.   All in all, good food, and take out service is super fast!"}
{"text":"This is close by home so we decided to stop in for the lunch special.  My son had orange chicken and I had yellow chicken curry. I really liked the spring roll it was very light and filled with lots of veggies. Temperature was perfect, served piping hot! It was the perfect serving size all the way around.  Our server was very sweet and attentive! They also  give a 10% cash discount. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've searched long and hard for a Pad Kee Mao dish similar to a place that had to close its doors. I believe I found it!!! It was so delicious even the next day when I reheated it. And you get 10% off if you pay cash!? This place is such a hidden gem and I'm glad I was led to it. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from here. It's the only thing I've eaten today. I used to get take out from Gata very frequently, but that will now have to stop. Seriously upset."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their food is top notch. Try the Panang curry or the Singapore noodles, Yum!"}
{"text":"I was pretty wary about trying the new restaurant in the gas station parking lot (especially any place that bills itself as more than one country's cuisine without specifically being fusion - \"Thai\" and \"Chinese\"), but seeing all the rave reviews gave me hope. We ordered takeout - the lady who took my order was very friendly, and the food was ready within the estimated time frame she gave me. If you pay cash, you get a 10% discount.   Drawback 1: when I walked in, I noticed the smell. Not an Asian-food smell, but more of a wet-mop kind of smell.   Drawback 2: The fried wontons are practically empty! I think I had one that literally WAS empty. They are pretty much wonton chips with the smallest smear of \"meat\" that I have ever seen.   Note: They take their spice seriously, so in the future I will have to notch it down a little bit.   The pad thai was fine, but definitely not as flavorful as it could have been. When you open the box, the aroma doesn't waft out - even when you stick your face in to get a whiff, it doesn't have that delicious smell.   The pad-see-ew and crab rangoons were also just \"fine.\" I have never seen such homogenous / sticky sweet & sour sauce in my life - looks like it came from a pump. It was deep (artifically so) red, like the color of the 5-star reviews. I will attempt to post pictures of the very sad wontons after I write this...  I don't think I will be coming back here unless Naga Thai is closed and I'm really desperate"}
{"text":"Our first time eating here! Loved it!!! A ten is definitely a ten!! Very spicy but oh so delicious!!"}
{"text":"So happy this place opened up so close to home.  Yummy yellow curry, and they offer the spice level from 1-10. Garlic chicken delicious with crunchy garlic sprinkled on top. We do wish they had some outside seating, though. We will definitely be back!"}
