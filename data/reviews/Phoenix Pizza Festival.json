{"text":"My rating is mainly based on the lack of organization with the event. Understanding that this was the first Pizza Festival, from what I understand, it wasn't the first food event put on by the promoter. The venue was perfect (nice park) in downtown Phoenix. Assuming that we'd have plenty of pizza, wine and other spirits, we caught a Lyft from Chandler to the event (excellent choice on my behalf).

The advertisement for the event read that there would be slices for $3-$4 each. Not so. I don't think one vendor had a bottle of water for that price let alone a slice of pizza. 

Some of the vendors were so popular that they either sold out 2 hours prior to shut down or the line was so long that one instantly caught the 'hangry' attitude (you wouldn't want to be around me at that time). 

Outside of the incorrectly advertised prices, the absurd lines and the running out of product, I'd say that the event was a acceptable.Should they put it on again, I'd definitely attend. Call it my insane love for the pie!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first year going and overall I was very satisfied. It seems like festivals are hit or miss. This one was a good time. 
 
The lines were manageable. I've been to many festivals where the lines are unbearable. Here, the longest I waited was probably about 10 minutes. 

The pizza vendors were all very good with reasonable prices. Most slices were $3-4. OHSO brewery had a tent near the front. Their beer is very good however by late in the afternoon they'd run out of two of their beers. There were a few more beer vendors but I only visited OHSO. 

The music was good and not too loud such that you couldn't hold a conversation.

Transportation wasn't too bad. I took the train to the Roosevelt St. station but there was also plenty of street parking.

The only downside was that there wasn't much shade where the tables and band were. Be sure to take sunglasses and sunscreen."}
{"text":"Second year of the pizza fest means the second year I've joined in.  There's some noticeable improvements this time around, though with some room for tinkering.  This year the number of pizza vendors grew from 12 to 16.  I will still say few of the truly elite pizza makers were here, but honestly I've changed my tune on this a little.  You can always find the most successful pizza makers at one (or more) of their brick and mortar locations around town.  Whereas the caterers and food trucks are often working their heart out to win you over in a heavily saturated market.  So this year I steered clear of the big names at this festival that everyone knows and loves (Spinato's, Rosati's, Z Pizza, & La Piazza to name a few) and instead opted to use what room I had in my stomach for the little guys.  The caterers and food truck operators who are cranking out their own best pies.  I think if you attend the Pizza Festival at some point down the road, you'll agree that many of these small outfits can put out a great product that can stand up to the titans of the industry.

Most the of pizza vendors this year were selling slices for $3 or $4 each.  Most were also selling whole pies for anywhere from $12 to $20.  There were a few vendors who didn't offer slices, which is annoying.  I still feel like Epic (the company that puts on this event) is missing the boat here by not just having patrons buy tickets for slices instead of making everyone scramble for change in their pockets as is the case now.  In addition to pizza, a number of local breweries were dishing out suds, a number of dessert vendors were also on hand, and there was plenty of chairs and tables to sit down and enjoy pizza with your friends and family (probably the biggest improvement from last year).  I liked Civic Space Park as a venue last year as it has a lot of character and is steps from the rail.  Moving it to Hance Park this year was probably a necessary move to accommodate the growing number of vendors and to allow more folks to partake.  They still cap the event (both this year and last year sold out 48 hours in advance) so keep in mind you'll want to get your tix in advance.  Also as with last year there's a game area with cornhole toss, life size connect four, and other shenanigans.  Hance Park also sets up as a nice natural amphitheater for the main music stage where music is playing at the Festival from start to finish.

So here's my biggest words of advice if you're coming next time around: 1) Buy your tix at least a few days in advance (try a week in advance if possible just to be safe), 2) Bring only cash as few (if any) of the vendors take cards or have a Square system, 3) Bring $20 in cash minimum as that will get you a drink and about 4-5 slices (or in my case no drinks and 6 slices), 4) Park at the Library or along Portland Street as you should have plenty of space in both areas to do so, and 5) wear sunscreen as there are few shaded areas & the weather has been sunny and in the upper 70s both years I've been.

So if you love pizza and want to discover some new pizza creations (or do the opposite of me and grab a few slices of reliable standbys) the Phoenix Pizza Festival is a popular event that is growing by the year.  Down the road I hope they incorporate some pizza competitions as well as more vendor options to make the event that much better.  And hopefully Epic is able to fine tune their organization of this event with each passing year.  Here's to pizza!"}
{"text":"Great weather, good location and good time of year to have a festival. 

It was a bit unorganized at first, not enough communication with ticket sellers and some inconsistencies among prices and offerings by vendors causing a perceived quality and value disparity with the pizza samples, slices and whole pies. The lines were long shortly after opening at this sold out event, but that was to be expected with a popular food such as pizza. 

There was some great pizza, some not so great, so some was fresh and tasty, some was piping hot, some was cold and old. It would be nice to have more places to sit and enjoy the band or the company of friends and libations while eating pizza, sipping beer and wine and having ice cream or shaved ice. However, there were many happy faces, and the outdoor games were a nice touch. 

The festival had a good mix of vendors and it was not too bad for an inaugural event. Next year the kinks should be worked out and vendors will be better prepared. Overall a job well done, looking forward to next year."}
{"text":"We arrived shortly after 11 when it opened and were able to walk right up to many of the vendors and order! The lines were very short, if any, in the beginning. We knew that wouldn't last long since the event was sold out.

About 99%of the vendors served Neapolitan style pizza. Some had very different toppings but it would be nice to see different styles of pizza in the future.

The best was the dolce diavo from La Piazza Al Forno! It had San Marzano tomatoes, House
Made Mozzarella , Sopressata , Calabrian Chiles, Basil and Honey

I'll attend this event again in the future, but I'll make sure to get there early again!"}
{"text":"Got to try a zillion pizza places in one day, then collapse in a beer pizza coma for the entire afternoon. Went early and avoided lines, even got some free pie. Good music, good people. Just a bit crowded at times. Its a festival, so that's how it goes. Some of these pizza joints need to learn the Henry Ford method of assembly line production because even with no line we waited up to ten minutes for something that was already made. Passing the order and receipt to four people to produce a small square of pizza seems like overkill, just saying."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, I wasn't expecting much, but man was I underwhelmed. 

You pay $10 (plus $2 service charge if you booked online) just to get into the damn place (oh and that's after you wait in a 20-30 minute line to get in). 

After that, your day will consist of waiting in ridiculously long lines to get tiny slices of pizza priced at $2 or $4. Rinse and repeat. 

They do also have alcohol available for purchase (unsure of the price but I'd guess $8-10) a glass. Oh and don't even try bringing in your own water. Security will stop you (unless you're sneaky and hide it like we did). It's not like this takes place on a sunny day in a desert or anything... 

When you finally do get your pizza (we waited in our line for at least 45 min), it's so sub optimal. Sure they have somewhat exotic combinations but at that rate I would have rather just gone to Pizza Hut! 

I wouldn't recommend checking this out next year."}
