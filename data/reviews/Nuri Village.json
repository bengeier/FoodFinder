{"text":"Shortly after sitting down, our waiter took close to 5mins to bring us our menu, even though it wasn't that busy.

Although my friends enjoyed what they ordered (bulgogi and spicy chicken), my pork bone soup didn't taste that good. Especially when it is a signature dish at most Korean restaurants, they should improve on the quality as it is something most customers order. The flavour of the soup was blend, and it was also cold.

Each of us ordered our own dish, as well as some dumplings to share. We told our waitress we wanted to pay for our own dish, and split the cost of the dumplings. However, she said their system was too old to split bills in which we each ended up paying twice (two separate transactions). During the time we were paying, she explicitly said \"this is so annoying,\"  rolled her eyes, and gave us the impression that she was very impatient with us. I've never been to a restaurant where splitting bills isn't allowed, especially when Nuri Village just opened, they should at this point have updated technology. 

Overall, I most likely would not return based on the food and service we received."}
{"text":"It was just ok.  Portions on the small side.  Everything was a bit spicier than other Korean restaurants.  Was not very impressed and will probably return to Owl instead for Korean food.   They have these weird flat metal chopsticks that were really hard to use.  I'm Asian and accustomed to using chopsticks!  I kept dropping food with these ones haha."}
{"text":"Love the food!!! Reasonable prices, clean pleasant atmosphere, and amazing food! Tried this place after driving by Owl of Minerva which had a line up! Glad we decided to drive around the corner!!!"}
{"text":"It is cheap compared to most restaurants, most of the dishes are $9.99 before taxes, but the portions are extremely small. My friend and I went in with high expectations because of all the positive reviews, but we were very disappointed with the food. The taste was okay, but the portions were not worth the price. Both of us left the restaurant still hungry. We had to go to another place to eat! At least the service was quick."}
{"text":"Service was slow and food looked old. Asked for cold water waited for more than 5 minutes because they were chatting and forgot about it. Food are oily and look old."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with friends and was really craving some pork bone soup. First thing I noticed is that this place charges much more for comparable food than other restaurants. While pork bone soup / gamjatang typically costs roughly $8-9 in the GTA, it's $11 here. All the other menu items are even more expensive and all start at $13. I figured that the price difference would be acceptable provided that the pork bone soup but alas...

My pork bone soup arrived in a piping hot bowl, but the bubbling didn't last long. There were four massive bones piled up high, but unfortunately, there wasn't much meat on these bones. It was all tendon and cartilage, making it very difficult to eat. I had to use my hands and go all in, but still couldn't get the good stuff. The bones were underseasoned compared to other places. Moreover, it was a disappointment to find that all the bones were cold even before digging in - they had piled the bones so high that none of the hot broth could touch the bones. 

The broth itself wasn't very flavourful and lacked certain depth. There was one chunk of potato, and a few leaves of napa cabbage, but for the most part, the dish was composed of bones. There are definitely better places to get pork bone soup and for a better bang for your buck.

My friends ordered bibimbap and spicy squid. The bibimbap seemed to have a generous portion of toppings, and was piping hot. The spicy squid came on a sizzling plate and was quite spicy indeed! There was also a nice assortment of banchan to eat, and the waitresses were very generous with refilling the side dishes. That said, I am unlikely to return as I honestly think there are better places to eat Korean in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Quite a pleasant surprise that this place has great food.  I ordered the beef bulgogi. The marinade of the beef is very good and the meat itself is tender.  The pork cutlet is also good.  The appetizers are also very good."}
{"text":"Very good service. Awesome first time experience.

I ordered a Ramen and asked them to make it spicy. It was fiery hot and deliciousThe noodles were properly cooked and the soup/curry was spicy as asked 

Must visit if you wanna try something nice in Asian cuisines..."}
{"text":"Really liked this place-- have gone back a few times. The staff don't hover but will bring new plates for the middle of the table when they see you're getting low. Usually has a full floor of customers, but the food is great and it's worth the short wait. Staff is very friendly and the environment is upbeat and theyre always playing Kpop on the TV by the bar. Have food for people who know what to order and for beginners to Korean food. Really great place."}
{"text":"A nice, cozy korean restaurant. We ordered Pork Bone stew and the meat was so tender and juicy. Their service is much better than average korean restaurant. The waiters were attentive and responded quickly to our needs. Worth a try"}
{"text":"Great place to go for Korean food. In my opinion, it's much better than Owl of Minerva (even though that one opens for 24 hours. The service is quick and friendly. 

This restaurant is very clean and has a nice interior. There's a upper level that\s is modern and has wooden accents. They also open until 2 AM every day. The menu is clean with large photos and descriptions. I also enjoyed how they have many side dishes such as the fish cakes, kimchi, bean sprouts and seaweed. 

We ordered the Japchae and the Yookgaejang. Both were very tasty. The Japchae had lots of veggies and beef. The flavour wasn't too wqeet and the noodles were cooked so they had a nice chewiness to them. The Yookgaejang is a Korean traditional spicy soup with beef and vegetables. It's one of the spicier stews so I asked them to lessen the spicy level, which they did. The stew was very flavourful and had lots of vegetables like mushrooms and beansprouts, as well as egg, beef, agree onions and sweet potato noodles. 

I will definitely come again to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Just love friendly staff. 
They becoming busier and busiest.
Food is always great. Just make sure to call ahead for the party 10 or more. they always try to accommodate the request but nice to see the table ready without wait."}
{"text":"Nuri Village is one of my go-to places for Korean food in Mississauga. I see this as an improved version of Owl of Minerva. Food quality wise, it's comparable to the good locations in Toronto. Price is reasonable and you usually get the standard side dishes. Two of the dishes that I enjoy is the Pork Bone Soup and Bibibamp. 

For the Pork Bone Soup, the pork is well made and comes off the bone easily. You may have to get your hands dirty though if you want to get the meat between the bones. It's the cheapest main dish on their menu and is well worth the value. I do find the soup base to be a bit saltier than I would like, but you can't really go wrong with this choice.

I read reviews on the Bibibamp having less meat than usual, but my last visit, I found the amount to be decent with a healthy portion of vegetables. There is quite a bit of rice on this dish, so you'll find yourself pretty stuffed afterwards. Make sure to stir up your bowl as your're eating so the rice doesn't burn on the hot bowl. 

Staff is friendly and welcome, so it's always a pleasant place to visit if you're craving for Korean food. One of the great places to go for a late dinner since they are open late."}
{"text":"I love Korean food, maybe even as much or more  than Chinese food (don't tell my mom).

Quite a bit of variety on the menu although I didn't see soon dae but it looks like they're adding items so there's hope!

Ordered the deep fried dumplings, bulgogi hotpot, and Jjam pong (spicy seafood noodle soup).  Miga on Dundas used to serve a great one but sadly it's no longer on the menu.  

Banchan includes pickled radish, fish cake, bean sprouts, pickled cucumber, and kimchi.  They were all tasty!

All the food was delicious and I look forward to coming back to try the other items on the menu.

Service is friendly and no complaints there!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday around noon and there were still quite a few tables left open. The restaurant itself wasn't small, but the seating felt a little tight (maybe because we're up on the 'stage' area and it felt constricting).

I had ordered their spicy chicken dish ($13.99), which didn't come with rice. My partner ordered the pork bone soup ($8.99), which was cheaper than other places in the area. His brother ordered the seafood jajyueng mein ($10.99).

To be honest, I was quite disappointed with both their dishes and the spicy chicken dish was mediocre. It wasn't the best I've ever had, but also not the worst. It was decently spicy, and I really wish it came with rice!

The pork bone soup was very one toned and seemed to be watered down but also filled with MSG. The noodles were also quite one toned and the sauce wasn't as thick as it should've been. 

Their side dishes were decent and they gave us a lot of variety. I think we had a total of 5 sides, but even with that, I'd much prefer Owl over this."}
{"text":"Comfort food seldom needs to be fancy. It comforts the body and warms up the soul. Korean food is one of those cuisine that fits my definition of what comfort food should be. You can slum it at a homey restaurant with a small group of close friends and family. Nuri Village will be our new go-to place! The food is flavorful and servers are very attentive. They are the saving grace as our usual Korean go-to dropped the ball. They fulfilled everything we needed them to be.

 We ordered the Gam-ja tang, and jap-jae. The gam-ja tang is very palatable; savory with depth and dimension to the broth. The meat was fall off the bones and potatoes, cabbage, and fermented beans are very distinguishable. We enjoyed that the bowl itself was gloriously boiling when it arrived at our table. We also highly recommend the Jap-jae. The flavors and textures were well balanced; each component of the dish was cooked to the perfect consistency. 

The assortment of banchan keep the dining experience at a high note. It kept the meal interesting. Noteworthy was their kimchi which was not overly fermented or salty. The sweet and sour pickles added a different dimension to the dishes. I loved their fish cakes as well. 

This is definitely a place you should try if you can't seem to find good Korean food. Service and food exceeded expectation in this unassuming little restaurant. Pricing is pretty standard and comparable with other Korean restaurants in the area. We will be back soon and often, especially on those winter days."}
{"text":"Their service would be rough during the busy hours. Some of their tables were tiny and uncomfortable unless they assigned you the right size tables according to your party right at the beginning. We asked repeatedly to move to another table after finding our 4 courses meal filled up the entire table. Then they started feeling we were giving them troubles. Surprised to us that some of their staff started to be mad and provided bad service. One of them dropped the water on the table so hard and yell \"here you go\"."}
{"text":"Great food and great staffs.  A must-visit place if you are a fan of Korean pork bone soup.  Totally different taste compared to Minerva ones, personally I like this soup base better."}
{"text":"A really good, welcome addition to the Korean comfort food scene in Mississauga, and, personally, I would prefer this place any day over Owl of Minerva. Located not too far away from Square One, this place is cleaner, a bit more modern, and seemingly more colourful, cheerful and brighter. Service is also very sweet, quick and efficient, and food comes out in a reasonable timeframe. Prices are average, perhaps very, very slightly higher than Owl - but for me, the overall experience makes it worth it.

I've visited a couple of times, and the food has been very satisfying each time so far. We've had the spicy bulgogi beef, bibimbap, pork bone soup, among other dishes. The appetizers/side dishes are pretty average, but there's one potato salad side dish that they have on some weekends that's actually really tasty/addicting - try to get this if you can! The beef bulgogi is tasty and tender - really well-seasoned. The bibimbap is just okay, but the pork bone soup + broth was nice, savoury and comforting.

This is a pretty good choice for a family dinner or group dinner - there are a good amount of tables, and you feel comfortable here. Nuri Village manages to be, and to have, a good balance of all the requirements you would want in a casual, go-to Korean comfort food joint. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 6 times in the last few months since they opened. 

The first time was a week night so they were less busy but still buzzing with new diners. 

We ordered all our favorites, LA Kalbi, Soon Tofu, Bibimbap, Jap Chae, Spicy Rice Cakes, Pork Pone Soup and Bulgogi! None of it was disappointing! 

Their soon tofu soup was so spot on for me I went back two days later for more. 

I was looking for a good Korean place around this area that has a lot of the staples but also some Korean dishes that aren't as main stream. 

I'll be back with a large group to have their Spicy Chicken Jjim!

Service is always perfect here, even in their busiest time with line ups at the door they are still friendly and genuine!

My family has voted this as a go to!

Only note would be to have more variation or types of side dishes!"}
{"text":"Nuri Village is what I would consider a 'safe' pick for some good Korean food in Mississauga. 

We went with their two classic dishes in their dolsot bibimbap and their spicy bulgogi and enjoyed both. The spicy beef bolgogi contained a good amount of meat and various veggies, and the flavoring was wonderfully sweet and spicy. I really appreciated the veggies here and there was a good variety here; there was plenty of bell peppers, broccoli and I was pleasantly surprised to find wood-ear fungus here! The bibimbap was more ordinary but still pretty decent; but I felt like there could have been more toppings as the mixture was predominantly rice.

The banchan side dishes were fairly standard and they only gave four varieties: bean sprouts, kimchi, fishcakes, and the seaweed. They did give a fair amount of them but nothing stood out and I hoped for some more variety.  My partner lauded them for their kimchi and thought it was tasty. 

The service here was stellar, they came to us twice before we actually ordered and the food and banchan came to our table lightning quick - it's as if they already knew what we were going to order beforehand! The waitress there was also attentive and refilled tea without being asked to do so."}
{"text":"This is where Koreans go for Korean food. Great service and food came at food speed. Comparable to Owl of Minerva without the wait. Definitely come back."}
{"text":"The first time i went to Nuri Village back when it first opened was a great experience. As always i use the Gamjatang as a gauge to measure it up agaisnt other restaurants.

The first time the pork bones were tender but after 4-5 months the Gamjatang consistently comes our with tough pork bones and minimal meat. 

Comparing strictly Gamhatang, arirang and owl are better in the vicinity.

Theyve also raised their pbs price from 8.99 to 7.99 then back up to 10.99. Price isnt an issue but when they serve subpar pbs its good to know there are other better options at better price points in the area!"}
{"text":"Great service. Cold noodles were ok. Not great. I only received three out of four side dishes .. noticed other table got pickles. I'd go back to try other dishes though as service was quick. The soups looked good"}
{"text":"Nuri Village took over what used to be Bukhara Grill, an Indian restaurant. It's standard Korean comfort food, more comfortable than Owl of Minerva. They seem to specialize in pork bone soups, family and group style. We ordered the beef bone soup, the pork bone soup, and the seafood pancake. The pancake was massive, but delicious. The pork bone soup and beef bone soup were standard and delicious, it was nice that they provided a bowl for the bones."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Nuri Village last Friday as I saw an article posted on insauga.ca. The restaurant was busy when we arrived but were seated right away. The food was okay, nothing out of the ordinary for me. I order bulgogi in soup. The broth had good flavor but I found my portion small for $13.99. My partner ordered the pork bone soup, $8.99 and both dishes came with rice.  However, the service was prompt and quick. Right after when we finished our meals, the waiters continuously circled around our table even though our beers were not finished that it  made us feel that we needed to go even though there were tables available all around. In the end, I didn't find the restaurant special. Perhaps, the hot pot or grill would be a good option to try. The had specials that would feed 3-4 people for around $70."}
{"text":"Didn't eat anything all day, looking for a restaurant opening late in Mississauga.  Found this place from Yelp and trying here for the first time.  Food came so fast.  The spicy pork with vegetables was $12.99 + tax.  Lots of very tender pork pieces and rice.  Cleared all the plates and I was very full.  Highly recommended this dish."}
{"text":"Went here for a late night dinner with some family. There were 5 of us, and the food came out relatively fast. The free appetizers were tasty and there was a lot of variety. The food was also great too! The staff was friendly and even joking around with us. Great hospitality!"}
{"text":"Whenever you're in Mississauga with a large group of friends, you can always count on Nuri Village to accommodate for large groups and serve up authentic Korean food. Here's rundown of this restaurant:

Food:
We each got ourselves our own individual dish and then shared a corn cheese and gganpoong gi dish. One thing I love about Nuri Village is the unlimited amount of side dishes you get along with your food.

The corn cheese was pretty standard and was served on a hot plate. Very good for sharing and lots of cheesy goodness for those cheese lovers. Was it worth the price we paid? Yes, if you're sharing, but this dish is pretty big for one person looking for an appetizer.

The Gganpoong Gi was HUGE HOLY! There was a reason why it was so expensive, but we didn't know exactly how big the portions were because the picture in the menu made it seem like it was a smaller dish. Gganpoong Gi was a deep-fried chicken in sweet and spicy sauce dish. It was pretty sweet and had a nice spicy kick to it. I was expecting it to be crunchier, but the coating around the chicken was a little soggy. It's the perfect dish for sharing with a large group, but hopefully if you order this dish, the chicken is crunchier. 

My individual dish was the Spicy Cold Noodles. The cold noodles was definitely refreshing, considering all of the food I ate prior to this dish. I am a sucker for spicy food and was a little let down when none of this dish had any spice. Unlike the picture in the menu, the spicy sauce was given to me in a squeeze bottle on the side. Moreover, the noodles were very dense and while good and acidic, was a little too much for me. I had to take home half of the plate because I couldn't handle all the noodles. DO NOT save this dish for the next day because it didn't sit well in my stomach after I ate it the morning after. (the noodles ended up drying out and it was quite chalky to eat). Despite the noodles, the rest of the dish was quite light and appetizing; however, I would definitely not get it again.

Atmosphere:
Pretty standard for a restaurant. There's seats, tables, and an elevated area for additional seating. It's pretty good for casual dining and social gatherings and didn't feel so cramped when we came with a group of friends. 

Service:
Service was good, but then again, one of my friends was Korean so it was easy to communicate with the server. While we had the Korean-speaking friend going for us, at times, it was hard to get the server's attention from our seats whenever we wanted additional sauces, side dishes or needed takeout boxes. I would suggest requesting to sit near the kitchen so that it's easier to get the server's attention. Another tip is that once you're done eating, pay at the front desk, rather than asking the server for the bill. 

Food came out pretty quickly; not too fast or not too slow. Having the side dishes out first made the wait time bearable as we had ample food to stuff our faces in, before the main course came in.

Price:
The corn cheese was $7.99, spicy cold noodles were $12.99, and the GganPoong Gi was $19.99 by itself. We actually got one of the Soju Combos which allowed you to choose a dish to accompany your soju. By ordering the soju with the gganpoong gi, it turned out to be cheaper than getting the gganpoong gi alone.

Verdict:
Admittedly, the shared dishes and unlimited side dishes were great and perfect for the occasion, but the spicy cold noodles were a let down. I usually get the Bulgogi BiBimBap when I'm here, but I wanted to try something new and the risk definitely was not worth it. The servers were MIA at times and it was hard to get their attention but when we interacted with them, the service was friendly. IMO this should be your go-to Korean place for social gatherings as there's ample parking and room in the restaurant (from the times I've been here). You should order the more popular food items rather than the ordering things like the spicy cold noodles."}

{"text":"Love this place! I always get bibimbap and japchae. However, one time we had japchae that was so salty, we didn't finish it. The portion was also ridiculous as if they used the remainder of noodles from a leftover package. They ended up giving a discount of some kind in the end. Other than that, everything i've had here has been positive."}
{"text":"For me, this place gets more of a 3.5 stars rating based on my past couple of visits here.

Pros:
-Good variety and portion of apps to start your meal (just ask for more if needed)
-Really good pork bone soup in terms of flavour and portion
-No shortage of food choices here!
-Fair prices for what you get
-Friendly service each time
-Clean interior and washrooms
-Convenient location on Burnhamthorpe (away from City Centre but close enough drive from it)
-Plenty of free parking in the plaza

Cons:
-The bibimbap is a decent portion overall for the price but every time I get it, it seems to come with even less meat and more rice each time; flavour could also improve
-It takes a while for water or tea to be refilled but not a huge deal

As you can see, the pros here clearly outweigh the cons! I'll continue being a repeat customer as I definitely want to explore more of their menu and my friends also enjoy coming here. Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"TIP:  This place is opened until 2AM!

Food is more like a 3-3.5*, but service was better than most Korean places!  Bachan/tea was filled promptly and staff were friendly.  This is probably because it's a new restaurant so they are still in the process of building their clientele!

Since they took over the old Bukhara Grill location, they haven't done much except for changing the light fixtures and maybe the furniture.  So interior is more upscale than Owl of Minerva and more contemporary than Song Cook's.  Atmosphere wasn't super lively as the restaurant was only 1/4 full.

There were 4 side dishes and they were just ok.  Nothing that I particularly wanted more of, although the waitress did refill them without prompting.

Both Soon tofu ($10.99, only 1 kind) and PBS ($8.99) were good.  Flavour in soon tofu was quite good, meat in PBS was fresh, and there was plenty of it!  I didn't detect any MSG in either of the dishes.

Good place for a sitdown, but I wished this place was a slightly cheaper/hole in the wall type Korean place 'cause sometimes I just like it quick, but not necessarily dirtier!"}
{"text":"I have to say that their service is very good compared to many other Korean restaurants. But their \"famous\" pork bone soup really \"surprised\" me, only one star, worst pork bone soup I have ever had. Pork meat is still cold, and fishy. Soup is not hot either. One time visit, won't come back."}
{"text":"Went with a friend to Nuri Village, craved Korean food, mainly Budae Chigae (Army Base Stew) that's meant for 2 people.

It's a nice place, with good number of tables and sufficient wait staff to go around to service.   Service was fine, nothing exceptional and our Army Base Stew was considered a good tasting stew but again nothing to get excited about.  All the expected ingredients were all in the stew, spam, hot dogs, ramen, american cheese, kimchi etc etc and in parts it was spicier than I thought.  

Banchan (Side dishes) were fine too, the kimchi was delicious, a lot of the red pepper flakes were on the kimchi.  We ordered the egg roll, which is pretty much a really flat western omelette, rolled several times to get that roll shape.  Tasty dish and both my friend and I enjoyed it.  Once we were done our meal, we went up to the counter, paid for the meal and were on our way. So overall, an average experience.

Why I give this 3 star rating is because it delivers exactly what I expect, a Korean restaurant with all the expected dishes you would expect from Korean restaurant and done decently well to an extent.  

I would say Nuri Village while it appeases to a certain need, to me it's no different to Owl of Minerva and all the other Korean restaurants that are in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Heard this restaurant is a franchise from Korea. Was pretty disappointed after all the visits. I guess I was expecting more of the food. 

I don't like the side dishes here. They lack flavour and is not salty enough. The kimchi in my opinion isn't strong enough. The only side dish that's good is the fish cakes. 

Yookgaejang ($11.99) - the soup is good but there's a lot of vegetables and not a lot of beef. 

Soon tofu ($10.99) - the soon tofu has mussels, clam, squid, tofu and shrimp inside. But the soup is really bland. Flavours not strong enough. You just taste spicy with a hint of seafood flavour. Not recommended 

Bulgogi Hot pot ($13.99)  - this ones pretty good. Ordered it a few times.  Come with some glass noodles inside. 

Gomtang ($11.99) - this one was okay. Similar to most places. The flavour was pretty rich. Salted and pepper was given to you to add your self.  

Pork bone soup ($9.99) - flavour was okay, thicker than most places and a little bit spicy. 

Spicy cheese chicken ($35) - comes with two rice. Spicy chicken topped with mozzarella and cheddar cheese. Served on top of a stove. There was barely any cheese. The chicken and cheese did not blend. There's a disconnection between them. The sauce was too watery and barely stuck to the chicken. As for the level of spicy, it's not spicy at all. I was expecting this dish to be spicier and the sauce to be thicker and more flavourful. On top of that, usually restaurant use only mozzarella cheese on top of this dish but this one used a mix of cheddar and mozzarella. I felt like this kinda killed the taste. It somewhat tasted like pizza. Very disappointed. 

Interior wise, I've been to the restaurant located here before this restaurant took over. The interior has not changed by much. The design still looks the same. But the lighting is better now, it's brighter.  The place is nice and clean.

Service here is good. They have stamp cards and after 5 visits you get a free pork bone soup. One stamp per visit. Dine in only.

Overall, this place is okay. They offer a variety of different food. They also have kbbq."}
{"text":"Second time here and still as amazing as before. They've also updated their menu. Went on a Thursday night and it got busy as the night went on. Only 2 ladies taking your order but very friendly. Side dishes were really good and you get a good variety. The kimchi was super delicious! Get the kimchi jigae; so flavourful!! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This new Korean restaurant is very popular in Korea having more than 200 restaurant opened! There are only 2 in Ontario as of now and it is definitely worth to check out. The food was delicious and the portion is bigger than other Korean restaurants (Owl). The menu was big as there was a lot of choose from. 

This restaurant is more of a fancy one. The service was amazing and the food came our very fast as well! 

I would definitely recommend this to a friend and revisit! The prices are good and reasonable. I would give this a 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Their spicy bulgogi is to die for!! $13.99 + tax, and including rice. Generous amount of meat, and very flavourful dish. They serve it on a sizzling plate. Would come back for it! 

The only downside of Nuri is that the prices could be a little on the higher side and there is not much of a value meal. 

In terms of their pork bone soup? Sure they put decent amount of meat. But OWL of Minerva's version is better. But other than that, if you want to avoid the LONG LINE UP in OWL. Nuri is definitely a good alternative. They might not be open 24hrs, but they're open until 2AM!!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this new place in ssauga. It was very quiet on a tuesday afternoon. But the service was really good. The korean lady who served us is super nice. 

The appetizer dishes were okay. There was kimchi, bean sprouts, potato salad and fish cake. The fish cake was the best. 

The food was pretty good too. Not too many choices for our vegetarian friends. But you can alwys go for veggie bibimbap!

Overall, i liked it. Would prob come back and try the spicy chicken with cheese."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Nuri Village. We arrived shortly after they opened and were shown to a table right away.

Our tea was served in metal cups, which I really appreciated over the plastic ones that it's often served in at other Korean restaurants.

The waitress was very friendly and efficent, arriving back after just a couple of minutes to take our order.

We ordered and our side dishes were delivered a few minutes later. We were both pretty hungry and had polished most of them off by the time she arrived with our dishes. She refilled them right away. We had kimchi, soybean sprouts, cucumbers and one that was new to me. It was a sweet and slightly spicy cabbage dish and the cabbage was VERY crunchy. I LOVED it! There was a single jalapeno slice on top. Unfortunately, when the side dishes were replenished, this one was replaced by sweet soy beans.

I had the soon tofu. It was good, but (in my opinion) not the best. There were mussels and clams and some squid in the soup. The soup had good flavour and spiciness but needed salt or some other seasoning. 

My husband had the pork bone soup and loved it. It had a generous portion of meaty pork bones and the broth was very tasty.

The restaurant is quite big, with plenty of seating. The waitstaff are friendly and attentive and the food is very good. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I finally decided to get out of my comfort zone and try a new Korean spot rather than stick to my one and only Song Cook's. I was a bit reluctant since there was no menu available online and my friend is a vegetarian, so I had no idea what to expect.
I was hard to find as the sign didn't stand out much. Once we entered it was pretty empty but it did fill up by the time we were almost done. My server was really friendly and greeted us well.
Their menu had plenty (but pretty limited compared to Song Cook's) and it had all the Korean staples, apart from my favourite- Hwe Dup Bap. I noticed that they offered one of my other favourites, which was the cold buckwheat noodles with and without cold broth, however it was listed as \"seasonal\". But when asked, they said that it was available. So my friend got that with the broth and I without the broth (with spicy sauce instead). This dish does have meat so my friend opted to remove it to the side.
We were then served 4 bachans immediately and then our food arrived within 5 minutes. It was delicious, although the serving size was smaller than I've experienced elsewhere. The noodles were well made with that unique chewy texture, topped with a hard boiled egg, 2 slices of meat, and served with a side of scissors to cut them up. They also kindly refilled our bachans when asked. 
There wasn't much for vegetarians, but the good thing with majority of these dishes is that they are easily converted to vegetarian. 
Prices were reasonable, pretty standard for a Korean restaurant. 
The decor was simple but clean and neat.
Overall, I really enjoyed my meal. Even though Song Cook's is still my favourite, I would definitely visit Nuri Village often."}
{"text":"I ordered the kamjatang and he ordered the bibimbap. Both dishes looked great and tasted great. I especially loved the kamjatang because it is slightly more hearty and spicy than Song's Cook. Loved the kimchi they gave as banchan. Service was excellent and attentive. Would definitely visit again in the near future."}
{"text":"This place has a horrible sign that makes it kind of blend into the rest of the plaza, which I think is why it wasn't so busy on a Saturday night. The food here is fantastic though. The Jap Chae was sooooo good. One of the best I've had and I've tried a lot. It was definitely the best dish of the night. The kampungi was also good and not that spicy. The soon tofu was above average too and pretty spicy. The ban chan is decent and they gave us a refill when requested. The food comes out quickly but the waitresses seemed overwhelmed because there was only 2 of them for a half full restaurant. All in all this is probably one of the best Korean restaurants in Mississauga now."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?! 

I recommend the spicy chicken sizzling plate. Comes with a rice and the chicken was quite spicy if you like the kick out of Korean spices. 

I tried the pork bone soup as well. Every Korean restaurant has a different recipe to make this soup. This restaurant didn't have perilla seeds in the soup and it was rather very salty. It also tasted spicy so if you like spicy Korean soup you might want to try it. Comes with four to five pork bones (not bad!)

We also tried the white noodle in beef soup as well. It was bland though. But the portion size was a good size for dinner! 

LAST TIP?!

You need to pay at the counter when you're ready to go. I suggest sitting closer to the kitchen as it's harder to catch their attention the further you are away from the kitchen. Usually there's around two waitresses per shift to serve you!"}
{"text":"My friends and I visited this place we felt very welcome and loved by the waitress that served us.  The lady were very honest of helping us to choose the right size of the dish we want. And it did turn out a ver good experience and yummy food! Their side dishes will change weekly. I think it can have a little more choices, because those side dishes always brings out enjoyment of eating Korean food."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant in Waterloo so I was ecstatic to see a location open up in Mississauga. I personally feel the prices are good and I like the food better than Owl. I took my friends who have not had Korean food before to Nuri and they had a great first experience! The korean ladies working there were accommodating of the vegetarian needs and altered the tteokbokki accordingly (even adding an egg since they didn't want the fish cakes). The banchan were great too (especially potatoes -- who can resist the korean potatoes??). I got the japchae and as always, Nuri never dissapoints with this. I'll be more than willing to bring more family and friends here for korean food. It's a lot more spacious than other places (and more modern as it took over an Indian restaurant that was here)."}
{"text":"I'm always satisfied by soon Tofu. I really like the flavor here, it's real Korea ; ) and the waitresses are enthusiastic and nice!"}
{"text":"Korean food, with a wide selection and delightful ambience. They don't t cram in diners like at Owl. Not open as late but they have a good variety and plenty to choose from.

I got a noodle bowl, the Korean name escapes me but the rice noodles and spicy broth hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Positives: Great Service, very welcoming & attentive. Love the little dishes they serve. Especially the fish cakes.

We ordered a Ginseng Soup with a whole Chicken and Pork Bone soup.
Nothing good to say about these two.
Ginseng Soup with a whole Chicken: Chicken was old and over-cooked. Soup didn't have any ginseng taste or aroma to it. It just tasted like a clean chicken soup. Usually when you have this soup, you should come out feeling very healthy and re-energized. Instead I felt bloated. I've had better. I know they can make this better.
Pork Bone soup: tasted like MSG-soup... doesn't have the aroma or smell that a pork bone soup would have. Isn't the pork-bone soup suppose to be spicy?
Anyway, disappointing dinner.

It's authentic Korean food minus the authentic passion in the food."}
{"text":"I first came across Nuri Village in Waterloo and I've always thought the food was great. Great surprise to see that a location opened up in Mississauga not too far from square one!

I would usually always go to Owl (which is just around the corner from Nuri Village) to satisfy my Korean cravings - but now I always go here. The food is just as good as Owl.. but without the crowded atmosphere. Just like Owl, Nuri Village is open late for those late night Korean food cravings. They also play kpop music videos for all you kpop lovers. They have a variety of options on their menu and the variety of side dishes is always a plus. I personally really enjoy their pork bone soup and the cold noodle & bulgogi combo.

All in all, a good Korean restaurant in Mississauga. I'm a regular and I'll be back again soon!"}
