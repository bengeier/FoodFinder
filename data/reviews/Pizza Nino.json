{"text":"The pizza is expensive ($27.50 including taxes for a medium size pizza \"La Québécoise\") but it is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, great subs.  My family has been ordering from them for as long as I can remember.  They make what was my grandfather's favorite pizza!!"}
{"text":"Plus fort que la concurrence! Ça vaut le détour."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!! I LOVE pasta and Pizza Nino's is like if your Nonna owned a restaurant type delicious. I have literally waited at the window for my delivery order to arrive because I so look forward to this place. It's so good! Their subs are also amazing. Pasta-Subs-Pizza, this restaurant is superb."}
{"text":"The food is delicious,  I had almost everything on the menu!!!! Service is Great!!! The Only little thing... It would need a New look inside.... I ' ve been going to Nino's Pizzeria  since I could remember...To me it needs A New fresh look up to date and Nice music.... But the food....Is delicious"}
{"text":"Not bad at all!  We walked in here last night a bit worried that we were walking into a disaster, but this was a pleasant surprise.  Quaint little BYOW Italian place on Monk blvd, with THE nicest hostesses, and great service.   We started with the calamari which was pretty good, followed by lasagna, penne bolognese, and the québécois pizza for our table. Nothing out if this wod but it was all very good! Nothing bad to say - Good service, good food, nice place, and decent prices! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Bonne bouffe mais le prix est beaucoup trop élevé ! J'ai aimé les sous marin mais 20$ pour un sandwich ca fait un peu prétentieux... Dommage !"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Best I've had in Montreal in a long time.  Real home made dough I suspect. Sauce and cheese are great too. Tried the four cheese, calabrese, and the nino deluxe. All were great!"}
{"text":"Pizza used to be my fav from here but now it's just strictly the Italian food.   Pasta is killer here as well as the veal plate. Try the fettuccini carbonara YUM. The veal was cooked nice and crispy with a little butter and they added a large lemon slice to make it yummy. Veggies were great the pickled purple cabbage was the best part for me."}
{"text":"Read a review that said 'Not bad' Not bad? Very few better in Montreal Consistent Quality Smiles What more could you want? Oh yeah, excellent pizza...and a great wine selection...from your own fridge.  Not the cheapest pizza in town, but one of the best, so the value is there!"}
{"text":"This family owned and run Italian eatery in Ville Emard is a great casual venue where you can go grab some good eats. This place is always busy! Whether they are hosting parties or big family dinners, I've never walked in to an empty table. It is a byow, and one of the few restaurants in the neighbourhood that offer something different than Asian food. The portions are very generous but I can't say that any dish really stands out; the food is just okay. The service is great for such a high paced restaurant and I like the cozy feel; a great spot for the neighbourhood where you feel welcomed.   Although I've dined at the restaurant once, I usually order my pizza from here for delivery. The pizza is good, with generous amount of cheese, and always well cooked. The sauce is a little bland and I prefer a thin pizza but it sure beats Pizza Hut or Dominoes. Delivery is usually a little longer than the 30 minutes others promise but I wouldn't trade this wood oven pizza for the others"}
{"text":"This restaurant is like having a little slice of Little Italy in the West End. Fantastic, homemade pasta dishes, incredible pizza, and wonderfully consistent, excellent service. It's a bring-your-own-wine restaurant, but the quality of the food is far beyond most BYOW places in the city. The Calabrese pizza (a simple blend of mozzarella, mushrooms, and homemade sausage) is my favourite pizza in the entire city. This place is also fantastic for large group dinners, but take my advice: MAKE A RESERVATION, and make it far ahead, if you're planning a large group dinner for a special occasion. I had my fiancée's last birthday dinner. After two disastrous birthday dinners in a row at other restaurants, Nino's more than made up for that this year with their amazing food and terrific service. Just go already!"}
{"text":"Great local restaurant. If want to go out and want , possibly the best pizza in the area this is the place. BYOW , with an SAQ across the street. the service is very good with servers who have been there for 15+ years, run by a 3rd generation owner, we love the place and it has become our go to local place."}
{"text":"So after reading the reviews I decided this place must be the best place in town.... So we ordered two pizzas and two pops the guy came to the door was rude expecting a big tip maybe? I don't know but he never brought us are pop but we still payed for them and then we go to eat the pizza and it's not even cut we had to spend 15 min trying to cut these two large disks ... If this is the best pizza in Montreal I'll wait to go back to Alberta... I wouldn't even give this place a one star it's a never return..."}
{"text":"Trouver la meilleure pizza est souvent difficile mais pizza nino peut afficher fièrement la meilleure pizza du sud-ouest.   L'endroit est toujours très achalandé lrs serveuses ont le sourire et très professionnelles. Les portions sont plus que généreuses et tout est fait maison.   Si vous êtes dans le sud-ouest c est la place pour déguster la meilleure des pizza."}
