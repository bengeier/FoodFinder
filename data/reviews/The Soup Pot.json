{"text":"Man, this place is the bomb. The fact that it exists in Solon and not one of the other 'burbs makes it even better, as that town's ample workforce can definitely use a good healthy lunchtime alternative to the droves of chain restaurants that line Routes 43 and 91. The restaurant occupies a small spot in the Giant Eagle plaza and is surrounded by several storefronts that at the time of this writing are unoccupied. People of Solon: SUPPORT THIS PLACE! It's family-owned and the sweet ladies that work the place will remind you of your one Eastern European aunt that derives bizarre amounts of pleasure from watching you stuff your soup hole with spoonful after spoonful of steaming hot goodness.

The homemade soups rotate in and out seasonally and are divided into hearty and lighter sections on the menu. They also have tons of veggie and gluten-free options. These soups are WAY better than the ones found at the Zoup! down the street. The wraps and sandwiches are pretty good as well, though not as outstanding as the soups. C'mon, what are you waiting for?! Get off your duff already!"}
{"text":"The soup is delicious providing the one you have a taste for is available. Went in there today and waited for at least 7 minutes for someone to come up to the front to help me. The only worker in sight was busy working back in the kitchen and never noticed someone waiting to place an order. I left without food. 
Not having an employee stationed in the front for long periods of time could put the restaurant in a vulnerable and dangerous position. 
On a good day service is extremely slow. You can't get in and out fast. They move at a snails pace. 
The hours are not conducive to workers that go on lunch break before 11:00 am. This doesn't make any sense to me. 
Get it together Soup Pot. You may be losing more business than you know!"}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars because my first and only impression of this business wasn't the best. I figured I would try it out after driving past but as soon as I entered I received a cold, unfriendly greeting. I'm not sure if that experience is normal,  but after looking at the menu and quickly reflecting on the \"warm\" welcome, I decided to take my business elsewhere. Hopefully this experience was atypical but unfortunately, I won't be returning to find out."}
{"text":"soup was good but I stopped in a after lunch rush, and the place was pretty messy. Also, I ordered ther soup to eat in but server put it in a styrofoam container, and when she put lid on, bunch os soup overflowed and created mess of the container, and she gave it to me with one napkin.  

Like I started, soup was good but the overall experience was not very pleasant."}
{"text":"This is a very small place, with home-made soups and some wraps and sandwiches. It is owned by a serbian family, and some of their soups are really, really interesting. All the soups are absolutely delicious, I highly recommend them! 
The only reason I am taking a star is because of their wraps -- they are just not up to par with the soups. But the soups totally make up for that. I would totally go there again."}
{"text":"I love The Soup Pot! The staff is so friendly, warm, and inviting! I love the food. It's cooked fresh and amazing... I'm mostly so happy that there are gluten free options! :)"}
{"text":"The owner of this place is friendly. They have traditional soups like chicken paprikash, corn chowder, tomato and a selection of gluten free items and vegetarian soup. They seem to be focusing more on traditional soup flavors.

I got the chicken paprikash, and it was decent. Shredded chicken, a tomato flavored broth with really no other flavors, kinda bland. This was all I got, as they were completely out of all sides (bread, cornbread, you name it). The customer before me bought everything left. 

I don't have an eastern european grandma who used to cook kielbasa or paprikash, the rest of the soup flavors here are not terribly interesting to me, and not one of the sandwiches here actually sounds appealing. Maybe this is too harsh as I am comparing them to Zoup! but I definitely prefer their soup varieties, sandwiches and salads at Zoup!"}
{"text":"Good stuff.

Food was good and comparable in price to similar restaurants. Good vegetarian options. Of the 5 soups made, at least 2 were veggie.

It's an added bonus that this is a spot that people don't know about. During weekday lunch rush hour (12-1pm) there was no one here."}
{"text":"This is going to be of my most frequented lunch stops. I prefer it to Zoup. Well, I prefer almost any family owned business to chains and generic stuff like that. The chicken paprikash soup was awesome. There was not any spaetzle or dumplings or whatever in it is, but it was more of a soup than the actual dish. It was very filling. They have a variety of gluten free breads and options. A fellow customer was commenting that the bread was her absolute favorite of gluten free breads that she has tried. I highly recommend this nice, small place."}
{"text":"I agree with some of the other reviews about the sandwiches , I went in looking for a wrap or something like that but really nothing looked all that interesting , but was asked to try some of the soups which I did and was pleasantly surprised  , I agree some were not my taste but not everything is , there making them for a whole lot of people not just a few , the soup i got was a turkey chile and was very good I usually try to stay away soup for lunch because it can be a little messy , but was happy with the soup cornbread and service , I will return when is Solon again , as far a Zoup sandwiches go ? Your nuts if you think there all that great , there not there always missing something rather have good soup and a soup place then a sandwich anyway"}
{"text":"This a new favorite of mine. Kind of on the expensive side, but quality food. The soups are to die for, especially the stuffed pepper and corn bread. Family that owns the place is also very nice and I hope this place continues to do well."}
