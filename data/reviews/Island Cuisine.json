{"text":"I use to love this place when they first opened. Then they switched people and the food and service has gotten shittier and shittier. I most definitely will add this place to my list of establishments to avoid!"}
{"text":"This place has changed use to be the best island food in the area.Very sad, tastes like the sauce has been watered down from the jerk chicken to the curry chicken. Will not take a chance on anything else ,will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food, especially the oxtail dinner. (At least USE to be) It's just veeerrryyy slow service as If they cook made to order. Expect to.wait 10 mins minimum per person ahead of you. Yes, just for rice, cabbage & meat to be scooped into a to go container.  I use to go at least twice a week but & in the summer months I've had to leave a pretty short line because they're soooo slow AND they don't have A.C, which makes me dizzy & nauseous after a while. My last few visits I saw unfamiliar faces & the oxtail recipe completely changed, it's disgusting. I thought it was a fluke but sure enough it happened 3 more times. If the old owner doesn't teach these new guys how to cook, they won't have this business much longer.  Idk what that sauce is they're using in the oxtails now but eeeewww and it breaks my heart because this was the ONLY place that made it just perfect and now it's the worst."}
