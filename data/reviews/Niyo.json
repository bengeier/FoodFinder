{"text":"Unfortunately I found a hair on my plate.  I dismissed that and I proceeded to finish miso soup and then noticed a small dead bug clinging to the soup bowl.   The staff were pleasant and embarrassed when this was brought to their attention and proceeded to give us two dollars back for the soup.  The rolls we had weren't the 
greatest.   And during our meal we were fearful of more unpleasant surprises.  Thankfully, there were no more.  We have decided not to go back again after spending about 30 bucks there.   Definitely not the best sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible experience all around. I don't give one star reviews lightly at all.

Received menu at my apartment and decided to order a few items to try it out. Having some sushi on delivery seemed great and we like to order often.

Wonton Soup - Flavorless. Like warm water. Disgusting.
Crab Rangoon - Okay, but the accompanying duck sauce had a bizarre flavor. Bubbly and had a weird orange soapy flavor.
Green River Roll - Absolutely flavorless and mushy.
Shrimp Tempura - Also ok.

I am very patient but I was upset that I just spent almost 30 bucks and everything was very poor quality. I called the restaurant to let them know we were not satisfied with the order, it was poor quality, and we would not be returning. The girl on the other end says she will get her manager and then hangs up.

Ok, it was a mistake. I call back and no one is answering my phone.

I call with another number and they answer right away. Clearly they were avoiding my number. I ask for the manager, and she tells me he isn't there.

Terrible food, poor service, and giving me the runaround on the phone instead of a simply acknowledgement or apology just added insult to injury.

Avoid!"}
{"text":"I went in to this place to order my food and while waiting on my order an employee came right in from the parking lot and started fixing food w/ out washing her hands. So if you are a person who don't mine people NOT WASHING THERE HANDS than this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Always leery of a menu in the mail box, but Niyo was worth the time. Sushi bar and full menu available at reasonable prices. Combo platters are generous enough for two. Soups are hot and tasty. Steam dumplings were delicious! Tempura veggies were fresh, tender and NOT oily. The staff welcomed us and were eager to please. I do believe we have a new favorite."}
{"text":"Nyoshi's replacement Niyo has the great Japanese hibachi food you are used to with a new clean and updated look. The food, service and atmosphere were top noch."}
{"text":"Chicken Hibachi was dry and didn't have much flavor. Sweet carrots were not sweet and could have been a little more tender. Fast friendly service"}
{"text":"I just got my food delivered at my apartment. First off all let me start saying that when i received my $40.00 order i was missing pretty much half of it and i did not notice this until the delivery guy left.

 So than i call the restaurant and a lady answers the phone with little English and am trying to tell her that i had just gotten my order delivered  and was missing half of my food. She goes on by trying to take my order and am trying to explain to her that i had already ordered.
 Anyways after 5 minutes of me and her trying to communicate she finally somewhat understands me and starts looking up my order.
 
Than i specifically tell her i am missing the soups and the salads that the hibachi chicken and steak supposed to come with, she goes on by reading my order again and again which i was well aware of what i had ordered. 

 After  her doing this multiple times she goes on and says \" oh i dont see salad and soups here on paper\" i respond what do you mean you dont see it on there, on your online ordering it says it comes with soup and salads??  Than she goes again \" yeah yeah ohh ok you didnt put it on paper. Finally i told her you know what whatever thanks and hung up phone.

Once i finally start my food it was mediocre at its best. Flavor less steak and chicken. No salt. No seasoning at all!!! I had ordered my steak well done. Well it was medium rare which i dont like. Vegetables no taste at all. And of course flavor fried rice as well!! 

Save your money guys and do not waste your time or money ordering at this place. Terrible experience from begging to end!!  Will never order from there again even tho is across my appartment."}
{"text":"Do not order here. I ordered delivery and the food looked old. As if it was made the night before and was leftovers. I was hungry and working so long that I didn't care at the moment. 

Three hours later I cared. Their food made me so sick that I was using the bathroom all night. Disgusting. 

They also charge way too much for a \"delivery charge.\" Their food is not worth it. The service is not worth it. I paid $30 to get sick."}
{"text":"The most flavorless Chinese food that I have ever had the displeasure to put in my mouth. While it was obviously fresh and not greasy, that still is not enough to rate it more than one star."}
{"text":"This is one of my fave nearby spots and for a bonus they deliver sushi love this place and sad to see the poor reviews."}
{"text":"Niyo has great service.  I have gone once and the food was good.  The second most important thing is that they do not use MSG!!!! yay!   I will try to get back to Niyo one day.  I went at the recommendation of my nail technician and appreciated the recommendation.  The sushi was good and so was the shrimp and chicken hibachi!"}
{"text":"Sushi is pretty good. I tried the lobster salad roll and a deep fried roll that I don't remember, they seemed average on freshness but tasted pretty good. The wait takes forever, and there is a slight language barrier, or maybe rather indifference, with the staff. Will try again, but next I'll order 30 minutes in advance instead of waiting so long (both times slow, although only two tables were filled)."}
{"text":"The staff is really friendly and they deliver which is hard to find with sushi. They always remember me and chat with me pleasantly. They've even brought my order out to my car when I was waiting with my sleeping toddler for the order to be finished. The Tiger Roll is definitely my favorite and the Butterfly Roll and Wasabi roll are good as well."}
{"text":"I hate doing the 1 star thing.  But there was nothing about my experience that would make we want to give this place another shot.

It was rainy out, I was feeling lazy, and just wanted some delivery.  I called and was instantly kind of put on hold.  Not totally on hold as I could hear everything going on in the restaurant.  When she came back to the phone she asked me what I wanted(in very broken English).  I gave my order and mentioned a coupon, but couldn't get a total out of her.  I should have just gone with cash at that point, but still gave my credit card.  She then decides to tell me it will be over an hour after she runs my card.  I had some snacks around the house, so I figured I would just deal with it.

A little over an hour later my food showed up.  I tipped 20%+ as it was raining pretty hard.  Then I look at the receipt.  Not only was my coupon not honored, but they put on a $3 delivery fee without telling me.  I asked the delivery driver about the coupon and he said there was nothing he could do and agreed that the person answering the phones didn't speak English very well.  He could have at least pretended to make a phone call though.

Then onto the food.  Hibachi Steak, chicken, and shrimp with white rice.  Well, they gave me fried rice instead after I was specific.  Then the meat...... EWWWW.  The shrimp smelled really fishy and had some weird slimy coating on it.  The chicken had quite a strange texture.  The beef was at least edible, but barely, and the texture there was off too.  My dog wouldn't even eat it.  I ended up just making fried rice with the veggies and the rice and threw everything else out.

With sooooo many Asian spots in the area, I doubt I'll ever give this spot another try."}
{"text":"Ordered sushi and hibachi shrimp. Sushi was a couple days old and not fresh. Had to throw it away. Hibachi shrimp was $11 and got 5 shrimp. Fried rice is blan, veggies undercooked. I wouldn't recommend this place for any reason."}
{"text":"Absolutely the WORST service ever!!! Ordered scallion chicken, sesame chicken and beef and broccoli with white rice (all lunch combos). When we got the food instead of the beef and broccoli, we received general tso's chicken combo. Called them back, as the driver had left, and he said he was sorry he placed the beef and broccoli in the wrong bag (another person ordered from our job as well). He first asked if we could find the person that had our order to switch it ourselves. Absolutely not! I was not going to eat food that had been in the hands of a stranger! He then said ok we will cook a new one. I asked about a discount and he said you can keep the general tso's and we will bring a new beef and broccoli. So the driver comes and i go to get the beef and broccoli and he asks me for the general tso's back. I said, no that wasn't the agreement and they store said we can keep it. The driver was nice ans said ok. The store calls me back and says he received a call from the driver and they need the general tso's back. I told him that wasn't what he told me not 30 minutes ago. He started yelling at me and said I will give the food back. Why, so they can reheat it and serve it to another customer??? I told him we would never order from there again and he said yes you will and hung up on me. Absolutely the worst customer experience ever!!! Please, please, please don't order from them. At your own risk!"}
{"text":"Hibachi is not as good as other places but their sushi tastes alright.
Service was good though. I would go to Toyama or Yoshi's as they are just few miles away."}
{"text":"Was craving hibachi one night and my boyfriend and I decided to give this place a try and order take out and we were less than satisfied. Sub par food and a little overpriced for what it is. The woman who works at the front desk is extremely rude. While on the phone trying to tell her my to-go order she hung up on me before I could even get the total or the time it would be ready by."}
{"text":"Waitress has a language barrier.  I have been waiting at least 15 min for her to take our order.  They are slow with only one other table with one person at it.  Giving the crazy I am ready eyes.

When we got to order she walked away and then came back to confirm the order.  Hopefully the order comes out as expected.

Salad is minimal but not uncommon for this type of place.  The dressing was thick which is how it should be.

We ordered the lunch, one Sashimi and a Hibachi steak.  A fair spread of the Japanese fare.

The hibachi was as expected, a fair but slightly meager portion.

The sushi was up and down.  The yellowtail was of low quality.  The salmon and tuna were just fine.  What made the yellowtail so poor was that it was cut way too close to the bloodline of the fish, parts that higher end places wouldn't serve."}
{"text":"My roommates and I have ordered food from Niyo several times, the food is always really good and it can easily last for a couple of meals. I typically order steak and chicken and it comes with lots of great vegetables, specifically a serving of what I would describe as sweet brown sugar carrots that taste amazing. They just opened up their full sushi bar menu which I'm looking forward to trying. Highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The food was slimey! I've never had anything so disgusting. I actually spit my food out and threw it away. It was a to go order. I did not bother calling to tell them. No way slimey food was a secret.  I did keep their # in my phone, but added the word \"horrible\" after the name. This is by far the worst review I've ever given, but it was by far, the worst food I've ever had. Sorry."}
{"text":"worst delivery service ever!!!!! customer service is horrible!!! the order was all wrong today and they refused to correct it!!!!!!!!!! chicken was slimmy and shrimp tasted bad. didn't finish eating lunch, it's in the trash!!! my coworkers and myself will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"Food is good, and the resturant looks better than the last time I was there. I just became a fan."}
{"text":"While on a spontaneous lunch date, we decided to try a new restaurant.  I only ordered then eel avocado roll and he got hibachi chicken with shrimp.  I loved the generous amount of eel sauce on my roll.  He enjoyed his meal as well.  The restaurant got sort of busy while we were there.  My sushi was a little delayed once my date got his meal.  It took a while for the cashier to come take our payment so we decided to walk to the counter. Other than that it's a quiet spot for a cozy eatery."}
{"text":"The food here is great! I order from them all the time now. It's great to have a place that has Chinese and Japanese food. Delivery can be a little slow but that's my only complaint"}
{"text":"This place just opened! Used to be Niyoshi... But it seems like the place has changed hands. It was very sad to see it go. But it allowed for a new place to open.  Not as personable in decor, but just as good foodwise.

Glad we stopped by to try the new place out on its second day of business. The staff was friendly and the service was fast. Good Japanese lunch place is you work in the area."}
{"text":"Slow, small, mediocre.

Do you want incredibly slow service in a nearly empty restaurant?  Me neither.  You can expect that here at Niyo.

Are you hungry?  Then why are you at a restaurant such as Niyo?  The portions will not satiate your hunger.

You want some Japanese cuisine?  You can settle for Japanese food, it isn't bad but it certainly isn't good.  You want some sushi?  Prepare to hope for mediocre sushi because you might not even get that much here.

Never returning."}
{"text":"Worst sushi take out experience ever. They charged me and brought me the wrong roll. Drove back 20 min to get it resolved and the lady yelled at me for not understanding my order? Worst customer service ever. Never going back and the rolls aren't even worth it. Horrible management skills."}
{"text":"I usually order the sweet and sour chicken, Taoi chicken and sesame chicken. The food is freshly served. The portions are large and worth the money. The atmosphere is clean. And ppl are nice. It's right around the street from my house so I'm a regular and I recommend this to someone looking for a new  neighborhood Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"Headed to Niyo for some hibachi for lunch.. I almost went to find someplace different because of the reviews here. I am not sure were the others on the reviews went but it wasn't at all the experience I had.  
I did chicken Hibachi take out with Miso soup and Fried rice. Lunch was prepared quickly...maybe about 7 minutes The soup was very flavorful.  I really enjoyed it.  The hibachi was very good.  Vegetables were crisp and very flavorful, the chicken was seasoned nicely, and gave the dish a good taste. 
The only complaint that I can come up with is that I wish i would have asked for a bit more vegetables and more hibachi sauce.
The woman at the counter was very nice when I placed my order, and didn't just stand at the counter and yell Hibachi or Cyndi when my lunch was ready.  She brought it over all bagged up, said than you and wished me a good day.
All and All.. it's a good place for lunch.  I'll definitely come back and try something else next time."}
{"text":"They are consistent. I order online and they have consistently delivered the right thing. Garlic shrimp is good, the sushi, sesame chicken is yummy too. Usually about 45 min- a few times they have delivered in 20 min again. Can't go wrong with crab ragoon yummy!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't exactly what I was expecting when I heard it was a Japanese restaurant.  Now granted I've eaten sushi at A LOT of Charlotte area restaurants, but none looked like this.  It looks like a hot dog stand meets a corner Chinese restaurant.  There are black tables and chairs to try to give the place some ambiance, but that doesn't exactly work.  Also, there aren't any waiters, per se.  You order at the front, pay, and then go sit down until they bring you your food.  They don't bring forks for those who aren't skilled with chopsticks either (I am, so I wasn't worried, but what if I wasn't?) They give you styrofoam cups for you to get your drinks from a drink fountain (yes, exactly what you see in McDonald's).  Needless to say, I was completely taken aback by the whole scenery.

Now on to the food.  The shrimp tempura roll I had was pretty good.  I've had better at Ru San's, but here is a close second.  Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Sushi is great! They are light on their sauces compared to other Chinese places, it seems fresher!"}
{"text":"Just tried Niyo a few nights ago & was pleasantly surprised.  The previous resident, \"Niyoshi,\" wasn't very palatable, and we didn't have high expectations for this reincarnation.  Going thru the whole \"what-do-you-want / I-don't-know-what-do-you-want\" thing, we both agreed that we didn't want anything greasy.  That same day Niyo's menu was placed in our mail box.  Perfect timing.  So around 8:30 PM on a weekday evening we called in our carryout order:  1 chicken+steak combo and 1 chicken+shrimp combo (only $9.25 each).  Upon hearing the \"ten minutes\" closing, we kinda thought this may be money wasted.

Once home we began to dig in & were both pleasantly surprised with just how tasty our meals were.  And plentiful.  Having only eaten here once, I can't attest to whether or not this is typical, but they certainly didn't skimp on anything, which, for just under $10, was unexpected.  

Each combo came with the standard rice and sweet carrots, and a side salad (see photos).  Not sure if they have dressing options other than ginger since it was automatically included & weren't asked if we would like anything different (the other half doesn't like ginger & prefers Ranch).  

If you'd rather have than noodles than rice, you can substitute those for $1 extra.  They also have a nice selection of sides, which are all reasonably priced.  I didn't go in, but the other half said the employees were pretty friendly; not overly-so, but in no way rude or indifferent. 

Our total came to around $26. Not bad for two 2-item entrée's ($9.25 ea), two side orders of rice ($1.49 ea) and two side orders of broccoli ($1.79 ea).   We'll certainly be giving them another try!  :)"}
{"text":"I got takeout on one of my first nights in Charlotte. THe Dragon & Phoenix roll is awesome! Delivery was quick and my roll was still nice and hot. Just found out they are less than 2 miles from my office. I will defnitely be in for lunch soon!"}
{"text":"This is the only sushi place around where I live that delivers. Delivery is almost always 30-45 minutes. Not a bad wait time. 

Appetizers- 
The tempura vegetable appetizer is good, but from getting it to go, it ends up being soggy from the steam. 
Won-ton soup noodles are very thin and smaller than most other restaurants that I have gotten it at. 
Crab rangoon is okay, but not the best I have had. I think they they use a much thinner noodle/pastry dough than what I am used to (and prefer). 

Probably my favorite dish from here is the shrimp fried rice. Very good price for how much food you receive. I always order shrimp sauce with it (other Japanese restaurants include it on the side). 

The sushi is okay at best. I have gotten some rolls that were acceptable, but I have also had others that did not hit the mark for me. I sometimes worry about the freshness of the ingredients. Also, I think the prices are a bit high for the quality of food. I would much rather go to a nicer sushi restaurant where the rolls are the same price (but when I don't want to leave the comfort of the couch this place will do)."}
