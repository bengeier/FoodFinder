{"text":"Quite disappointed! I live less than a mile from here and was told I was out of the delivery range to order from here!"}
{"text":"First Timers! Had a little pizza craving at 11pm on a Tuesday Night. Ordered Hawaiian Pizza, Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad, Side Salad, Breaded Mushrooms and a cheesecake. (Lol a little more than pizza craving) Deliver time is stated on website 45min-1hr. Which is very reasonable for a place thats open til 3am..  With the quality food that we received tonight. The fact that they are open til 3am is too awesome. Their caesar salad is a really generous size and they even gave us more than enough salad dressing on the side. Pizza was nice, not too saucy. Breaded Mushrooms had a nice little crunch to them, and were nice and juicy. Great job for a midnight craving."}
{"text":"Lol... this is the first time I tried a place based on a NEGATIVE review, and I'm glad that I did!  Someone said the pizza was greasy and the crust was thin and soggy, so I thought 'hmmm... that sounds like real legit pizza!'  Here's what I would say about that description:  Greasy - when you make pizza, you don't add oil or grease... so this isn't something you can control.  The grease comes from using REAL ingredients like whole milk mozzarella, and good pepperoni.  Thin/soggy crust - no problem here.  This is because the crust is stretched correctly and there is a healthy amount of toppings.  When I think of the awesome pizza I grew up eating in NY and the east coast, I think of a place where there is a guy wearing a t-shirt, covered in flour, probably perspiring, and a pencil behind his ear.  He takes your order by asking 'whatcha you want?'.  There are no fancy toppings, different styles of crust, or ___ -free anything.  I haven't visited the shop yet (just delivery) but this is what the pizza reminded me of.   I ordered an 18 inch cheese and pepperoni... and it was perfect, I hope it is always this good!  It was delivered in under 30 minutes, and it was hot.  Easily the best pizza I've had in Vegas!  So good that it inspired me to sample something else from their menu... eating it now, and another review forthcoming!"}
{"text":"Order was incorrect and the person at the restaurant told me there is not a way for them to refund the amount they will call yelp and I have to call yelp also doesn't make sense how I just paid 10 in food and then 10 in delivery fee and I can't be refunded because they don't have an option this is non sense."}
{"text":"never ordering from this place again. they have just changed the pizza oven two weeks ago which cost their pizza to be cook more evenly. this means that every time you order pizza from them the bottom of the pizza will be black... but they will argue with you that it is not burned but this is how a pizza is supposed to be. HORRIBLE SERVICE"}
{"text":"Went in to eat at the bar and ordered from here. The pizza was crispy and delicious. The service was amazing the server was awesome! I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Pizza really was good. It would have been nice if it didn't take an hour and a half to get to my place, especially since I'm only 4 miles down the road.  Pizza arrived warm at best and the salad we ordered was left on top of the pizza and was room temperature when it came. They also forgot to bring the dressing for the salad.  All in all, pretty good pizza with good ingredient. The antipasto salad was mediocore at best, especiall at room temp with no dressing. I would consider carry-out if you wanted to eat here."}
{"text":"Terrible tasting Pizza. I thought I would give them a try. These Four star reviews on here for them has to be family or friends of theirs. The Cheese is very cheap and hard. Sauce had no flavor. They couldn't even cut the pizza evenly. A super large slice then a tiny slim slice.  How hard is it to cut an 8-slice pizza. A frozen pizza from the supermarket would have tasted better."}
{"text":"Don't read any more reviews or waste any more time.  Go eat here!  Do yourself a favor, get the chicken fingers. This place just has good, tasty bar food."}
{"text":"do not eat here unless u want to get sick. have severe food poisoning and wanna be sitting on the toilet all day!!!!!!  i have gotten dorty silverware many times and the plates had food stains on them. yuck!  so i ordered the pizza and it was a hot mess, everything slid off i couldnt even enjoy it.   i had to go to the hospital after eating here.   and there delivery service sucks!!!!!!!!!!! me and my husband and our friends from out of town tried ordering a couple weeks ago . took about 2 hours , food was cold !!!!!! soggy!!!!   worst place ever!"}
{"text":"Called in to place an order at exactly 8pm, they said it'll be ready for pick at 9pm.... got there at 9, not yet ready. Ok waited, 45 minutes later still no pizza then asked what going on, they said its probably being placed in a box, then she comes back saying \"oh the guy is having trouble with the oven\". Wtf! We left. Recommendation, dont go here. (Plus staff was rude)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have pizza on an almost weekly basis. We have been looking for our go-to pizza place, and when we had our first bite of Tony Big's pizza, we knew we had found our pizza place.   Disclaimer : I'm reviewing only their pizza delivery. I've never dined in (they are located in the Putter's).   Whenver I call in for my order, the staff is very friendly over the phone.  Love the pizza dough. It is the thinner kind, crunchy on the outer parts and softer towards the center of the pie.  Only had tried their red pizza sauce, which is flavorful. And they are always generous with their toppings."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, it arrived on time and the food wasn't soggy and it was still warm. Big portions, I'm pretty happy with my experience ordering from them."}
{"text":"We received the random door flyer and thought we would give this a try on a Friday night.  Ordered a 14\" supreme pizza for $13.99 and asked to have the ham substituted for bacon.  Wasn't a problem.  Also ordered the Meatball Parmigiana hot sub for $8.99 that came with fries.   As for the service, we ordered it for delivery and was told by the lady that she would call us back within a few minutes with the total.  45 minutes later. . . we hadn't received a phone call and honestly wasn't sure if our order was even placed.  Luckily it was, and it was delivered within 10 more minutes.  The fries needed some seasoning.  As for the pizza, good crust . . .but the sausage was awful and honestly - not the best tasting pizza.  I've had better and we probably won't order from Tony Big's again.  It was \"A-ok.\""}
{"text":"Ordered a grilled cheese sub, the menu says it comes with tomato and fresh basil. Food was delivered and I received a sub with melted American cheese. Period. Also ordered a cold sub, which was fine. Both were supposed to come with chips and a pickle spear, according to the menu, so I ordered one small order of fries. Both subs were delivered with fries so we ended up with way more than we wanted, and having spent a few extra bucks on an order of fries that was unnecessary. I won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Definately i recommend this place to try if you ever passing by...the managers (Bruce) is really a great friendly guy. whille we were playing at the pools and get to know him..he introduced himself.we ordered some food at the bar a few times and it was delicious. The bar area and lobby were nice and open, good place to relax and meet friends,,,they do plays live games there as well.the service was also great by servers...SPECIALLY by BRUCE..he jokes alot,so becarefull when you talk to him.lol...Anyways lets came back to review again,there restrooms are very nice and clean .plus they have a huge parking lot and its rite on the durango street.you can't miss it...and it stay open 24 hour ,,but they close the restaurant at 2 am..will come back and brings more friends."}
{"text":"Buffalo sandwich was great. Pizza was ok. Service was fast and friendly and followed instructions unlike most places.  Will repeat"}
{"text":"Just moved to vegas from la. Thought I try this place across the street from where I live call Tony bigs pizza n pasta. This was one of the best pizzas I've had in a long long time. I asked from something special and they brought me a thin crust pepperoni and jalapeño with NO SAUCE and WOW. This pizza is freaking awesome. Like I said one of the best I've had. Definitely referred and place and to try their pizza. I'm am happy and will be ordering and eating from here many more times to come. Thanks Tony Bigs. Made my vegas move worth it so far."}
{"text":"I Ordered The Stromboli for The first Time && it Was Cooked On The Outside w/ All Raw Dough in The Middle . The Lady Said Well its Made Of Dough Ummm Duh I Know That But it Doesn't Mean It's Suppose To Be RAW && Uncooked inside"}
{"text":"Love vic great service and his cooking is almost as amazing as mine love ya baby keep going big"}
{"text":"Can't believe how rude the manager Danielle is. They deliver an order, it's incorrect, I call and I am  pretty much laughed at cause I want my money back. Called back and ask to speak to the owner, conveniently he isn't there, the manager didn't know his last name or what hours he works. All that BS and the food isn't even that good and their customer service is even worse! Danielle really needs to brush up on her people skills or lack there of."}
{"text":"Horrible. What a mistake. Two pizzas, one pepperoni, one pepperoni, mushroom, black olive. The pepperoni pizza was a greasy, soggy mess. I couldn't lift a single piece out of the box because the crust was wet and greasy. Same with the other. Not cheap either. I picked it up because of the problems others have had with delivery. Bottom line: Steer well clear of this place. Never again."}
{"text":"Tony you pizza cooking magician! I'm new to this area and have tried some other places but I happened upon Tony's because it's New Years and they stay open late. Wow was I surprised! Everything was amazing. My girlfriend and I loved it all. Fried Zucchini is a must. Chicken Alfredo pizza was phenomenal!! Will continue to order from here!! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"3 stars bc the delivery was on time. But the food wasn't really all that great.we gots meat lovers pizza which didn't have much meat and the pizza was soggy. The wings had no taste. We did like the Gaelic balls tho."}
{"text":"Really rude delivery driver. Complained about his tip, lied about not being allowed in my building, huge attitude. Food took an hour and a half to get here. Figured out later the driver couldn't follow the detailed instructions I left to get to my building. Cold food,  bad service, no refund."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews i had to try this place out and i just received my pizza and it was delivered in about 40min when they told me about an hour. the pizza looks great and tastes even better. the girl that took my order was very nice and helpful with the order. the delivery driver was  nice too. will order again."}
{"text":"Delivered via grub hub.  Their lasagna was burnt to a crisp and inedible on at least 25% of the piece in the order. The antipasto salad was good and the garlic bread was yummy. I was very disappointed at the burnt lasagna though. It was for my kids and they couldn't eat much of it because that."}
{"text":"This Restrant has such great food  I vote it Best Italian food in vegas , The food atmosphere ,this is a must try a family owned restrant, the chef Vic  Is the Best !!!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I order from them and both time they bring me so da that's not good anymore and it's a little frustrating"}
{"text":"Ordered food from here a few times when I was sitting at the bar and was impressed on how the food was, I was expecting your average bar food but it turned out to be way better so the other night I ordered some food from home to try out their delivery service and i got my food in reasonable time, it was hot and of course just as good as when I had it in the restaurant. Not sure why this place got some bad reviews before but try it out yourself and then you be the judge.  Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"This place is awesomely delicious! We've catered from Tony Bigs several times for our studio events. The pizza and pastas were a BIG hit. If you haven't ordered from them yet.....you're missing out on some good food!!!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Walked in not knowing what to expect, but once I saw it was inside the same building as DREADFUL Putter's bar/gaming, I became afraid.   But the service was prompt and friendly. And the meatball sandwich was pretty darn good.  Fries were typical 'seasoned' frozen fries, but were fine.   If this place wasn't sharing a building with Putter's, it would have some real potential."}
{"text":"Quick delivery. Affordable. Decent food but a little soggy, even with the 15 minute delivery unfortunately."}
{"text":"Absolutely As Good As I could have possibly hoped for! We celebrate our late Dad's Bday with a Traditional/Annual Spaghetti Dinner in his honor (his favorite meal) and without a shadow of a doubt this was my Favorite & Most Delicious year so far & in a rather unassuming location! Thx to Yelp we found this place which we most likely would not even have considered (or even Found, as it is inside of a 'Putters' lounge) I wish I could give them a 6th Star!! Staff was Attentive & Friendly & the Value and Tastes Far surpassed our expectations!"}
{"text":"The delivery I ordered was TERRIBLE!!!!!! Don't eat here I got a Greek salad and they gave me lettuce, tomato, and onion. What kind of Greek salad is that?!?!?! That's not Greek salad. I ordered baked ziti too which didn't have the meat sauce, ricotta cheese, or the tomato sauce in it. This had to have been some type of cruel joke. It was just pasta with cheese baked on top of it. I called them to tell them about the trash food they had me wait 45 minutes for, they said they would deliver another order in 45 minutes. WHY WOULD I WANT ANOTHER ORDER OF THIS?!?!?! I demanded my $26 back I will never eat any of their food ever again this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Ordered online for delivery. It was simple and they have 5% off right now. Delivery was fast and the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite pizza place due to the fact that they deliver late at night when other places don't. Very good pizza and food as well!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Tony Bigs 3 times in the past 2 weeks via the EatStreet app. The first 2 times the delivery was fast and the food was delicious. Tonight, I ordered delivery for me my wife and a friend. I ordered at 1130pm and requested a delivery at 1am. At 1235 I received a call from the driver advising me that he was outside of my home and that he was trying to get someone to answer for several minutes.    I advised the driver that no one was home and that was the reason I had requested a 1am delivery time.   On my way home I called the driver back and was sent to voicemail. I then called the store and was advised the driver had another delivery and would be back by the 1am delivery time. It is now 140am. No delivery. I called the store and they stated they too could not get in touch with the driver. I asked how old my food would be and was told \"it's in a heater bag so it should be fine\". I was also told they would attempt to get in touch with the driver again and someone would call me back. It's been over an hour since the first attempt at delivery so I'm guessing the food is at least an hour and a half old.   Im disappointed. Still no call. Still no delivery. I really liked this place and suggested this place to several people. Looks like I will have to advise against this place now.  I'm glad I decided to pay cash this time because had I already paid, I'd be pretty pissed!"}
{"text":"Was told delivery would happen in 45 minutes. I waited 1 hour and a half, and got nothing. I called and was told the pizza was 15 minutes away.   I canceled my order, and I really wanted to try their pizza. It's too bad."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Eat24. Estimated delivery time was 45-60 minutes. A few moments after ordering, my order showed an extra 15 minutes to be delivered. No big deal. Then 30 minutes past the delivery scheduled time, I called to find where my order was. The restaurant informed me that due to being on the strip, that there may be some traffic The driver should arrive in 10 minutes, and their driver left 15 minutes before me calling the restaurant. About 20 minutes later, I got a call from the driver saying he wasn't allowed to go upstairs, that he was in the lobby waiting for me. I asked him if he was by the east tower elevators of the Luxor, he said yes. So I go downstairs and he is nowhere to be found. I call him back, and he says that he is at concierge, that happens to be where I am standing and he's not there. Then I tell him are you sure you are at the Luxor, the East Tower. And he tells me the Luxor has no east tower according to their concierge desk. Well concierge has long been closed, so I asked the check-in desk, and I asked the bell desk. No one has seen a pizza delivery person, and they all know there is an east tower at the Luxor. Eat 24 tries to repeatedly call the restaurant and the driver at this point, and neither answers the phone. Despite the restaurant still being open for another hour. I waited more than 30 minutes, walked around the hotel to all the entrances, and this pizza delivery was never to be found. I wasted more than two hours of my time, waiting for a pizza, that never showed up. Eat24 claims I'll see a refund in 5 business days.   Get your delivery elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I actually said ewwwwwe after my first bite of lasagne. What was the mystery meat? I'm thinking pork and chicken sausage balls. Gross! At least doctor it up with some spices. Do something! Cheap ingrediants in everything we ordered. Depressing."}
{"text":"This was the worst pizza that I've ever had. It was extremely soggy, probably because their sauce is water with a few tomatoes mixed in. The crust was soft, undercooked, and flavorless. The sauce also lacked flavor. I honestly didn't know it was possible to screw up pizza this bad. I will never order from there again. You're better off with a DiGiorno"}
{"text":"Wow! Ordered from this location and I must say that the food is fresh and yummy. Didn't try the pizza yet, but the burgers fries, wings and garlic knots are so BOMB! My husband said that the fries reminded him of the Coney Island spots in Detroit so we will be trying the coney dogs next. They are open late, the prices are reasonable and the delivery was quick."}
{"text":"Bbq chicken pizza was good once we resembled it in the box, is was everywhere, the cheese someone slid off the pizza and even on the top of the box, also couldn't keep the topping on when we actual led tried to start eating it. We also ordered fettuccine Alfredo, I don't know if I have ever tasted such a bland dish, tasted like the sauce was milk or something, I would not recommend getting any pasta dish if all of them are this tasteless. Really disappointed with the fettuccine Alfredo. Kinda expected more from a pizzas AND PASTA place, appreciated the free garlic bread stuff though."}
{"text":"Chef Vic is a genius. He made a couple of custom pizzas for me and they both came out wonderfully! My favorite thing on the menu is the grilled cheese, and ofcoarse zepolis! :D"}
{"text":"Ordered through DoorDash and they only saw the order after 45 minutes. So I had to wait another 30 minutes to make the food. After 1 hr I'm still waiting and there is no way for me to get my money back."}
{"text":"In the neighborhood for business.  Decided to get a chicken parm sandwich for lunch delivered.  Everything was fine until the delivery driver showed up to the office.  It seemed he had no idea how to go over an order from the receipt. After the awkward reading and him telling me I already paid, the worst customer service moment happened.  The driver turns around and walked out and said \"Thanks for the tip\" before I could even get The money out of my pocket.  Guy was a total jerk and didn't even allow me to give him the money I set aside.  Food was great, but the 2 stars are directly for that delivery driver.  Made my 5 star food taste terrible."}
{"text":"I've never been one to write reviews about places I've eaten at but this place won me over so I had to write about it...I stumbled upon this hidden gem one day when I was meeting up with an old colleague and we were both pretty hungry so we decided to give it a try.  The place is inside connected to a bar so it made it convenient for us to grab a couple of drinks also.  The bartender gave us menus and buzzed someone from the restaurant to help us out, so here's where it gets interesting a guy comes out from the kitchen with a chef coat and apron on so I figured he's the cook but then he comes over and takes our order like any other server would then proceeds to go back in to the kitchen and prepare our food and on top of that we see him answering the phones and ringing people up all at the same time so my friend and I were both amazed on how this one guy single handedly did all this, prepared our meal, brought it out to us, which I must say was very delicious and throughout our time there he never skipped a beat when it came to checking up on us and asking us if we were ok or needed anything.  The guy was super friendly and attentive to my friend and I great food, great price and a super star staff member! We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I ordered from here yesterday the food was okay, but the order was wrong i cant understand how the shit continues to happen  with these restaurants you will see on my receipt i clearly ordered spaghetti an meatballs but they sent spaghetti and sausage,  when i called they argued with me also i ordered an Italian sub oil an vinegar on the side yes they sent the oil an vinegar on the side but also put in on the sandwich, i just dont get it im gonna start putting my yelp reviews on my twitter i have almost 30000 followers im tired of these SOS Slophouses , ( same old shit slop houses  Joe philly's pizza, cafe verdi, sophias, now tony bigs they just throw you garbage an charge you premium prices please look at my photos"}
{"text":"We ordered the x-large meat supreme pizza. It was great. Equal toppings all over the pizza. The crust was great. It was thin but not too thin. The tomato sauce was flavorful. One of the best I've had in a long time. They delivered quickly as well."}
{"text":"This pizza was not good.  I was really disappointed since there was some good reviews. It had such a weird taste. My boyfriend who loves pizza didn't like it either. Such a bummer."}
{"text":"Over 3 hours of waiting and our food never arrived. Consistently late, over priced, flavorless and greasy and disgusting food. Not worth wasting your evening waiting for the food to arrive and not worth your hard earned money. Last time I had their fettuccine it made me feel like I was going to vomit."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this restaurant several times, but will not be ordering again. Yesterday I ordered thru Grub Hub their pesto pasta, spinach calzone which I asked for extra spinach and a large cheese pizza. Yesterday I was nursing a backache and is why I ordered three items. The cheese pizza was okay it was cut really strangely not the usual triangle slices but it tasted okay.  Later that night I heated up the pasta and it was way too greasy to eat. That dish went straight in the garbage. Today I heated up the spinach calzone. There maybe five leaves of spinach and the rest was yucky onions and tomatoes. It was horrible   I called Grub Hub and complained. They contacted the manager who refused to issue a credit for the lousy food.  Having ordered  their spinach calzone several times I can tell you there were NO ONIONS before. There also no tomatoes either. The manager is a liar saying that the spinach calzone comes with onions.  DO NOT ORDER FROM TONY BIGS.  You will be ripped off. I spent over $60 last night for lousy food."}
{"text":"I wouldn't order this again. I could make a better pizza myself at home in a normal oven. It was bacon and cheese....how does one make a bacon and cheese pizza that isn't great? It was just sad. Mozzarella sticks tasted like fish. Garlic bites have no texture. Just greasy, super spongey garlic flavored chunks of bread.  Mac and cheese bites sucked. Even the ones Del Taco used to sell were better.  There's a serious lack of crispiness in any of the food. All of it is squishy. No crunch or crispiness in the Mac and cheese bites or the mozzarella sticks.  No hard outer shell for the garlic bread. I feel like this food was made for old people with dentures."}
{"text":"food was good.  delivery person must have had the box tipped as 1/2 of the pizza toppings slid off the pie before I got it.  Wings were good, not a lot of sauce on them, i will ask for extra sauce next time.  overall will use again."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst establishment I have ever ordered from, I am outraged of the services and the food from this place, the deliver guy was outright rude and demanding, he demanded for a larger tip, he wanted $20 instead of $10.  Let alone the rude delivery driver, the food was wrong, they put several toppings that I did not want on my pizza and also they forgot napkins and forks and they even forgot to bring out Mac & Cheese balls. I also called to advise them and they told me they don't care and they will not fix the order nor will they refunded my money, I will never in my life go to this place again and I hope anyone else who wants to eat here does not  They are very unprofessional and rude and they call you names when they are being proved wrong.   I have contacted the BBB and grub hub and several other food services and they will do their own investigation.   Your pizza place is a terrible establishment.  Your employees are so rude and demanding."}
{"text":"I like this place!! I wasn't expecting it to be a bar/billiard lounge along with an Italian cuisine. I will definitely be coming back to this place to come hang out and shoot some pool.   Me and my boyfriend were craving pasta and I found this place on Yelp being the closest thing to me at the time. I was kind of skeptical over the reviews but I thought why not give it a try.  I ordered their spaghetti and the pasta/marinara sauce  was made exactly how I wanted. And their garlic bread was super addicting! I can't wait to go back I'm already craving their marinara sauce and meatball... 5 stars for this place!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend Tony Biggs. the pizza was excellent the crust was a must, the cheese did please, and the sauce was the boss. also have the lasagna is very good. the Parmesan crisp on top of the Caesar salad with an excellent touch. Next time I want two ! And the cost of the meal was very reasonable. thanks Victor!"}
{"text":"Tony big pizza delivery rocks. I've been ordering the salads recently I'm really impressed with how fresh and abundant all the additions with the size of meat and cheeses additional veggies has been excellent and really tasty I got to say a pleasant surprise because I didn't have high expectations for Tony Biggs and I guess maybe I should have. Great Italian restaurant that has good dinner specials and lunch specials as well."}
{"text":"Pizza was great! my family and I especially loved the dough and the zucchini sticks. Delivery was quick the only reason why I gave 4 stars is because they forgot my dipping sauce and I love my ranch with my pizza and zucchini. Defiantly will be ordering again, our new go to pizza spot !"}
{"text":"portion was big. taste very blend. noodle overcooked! average food quality."}
{"text":"Just make an order for delivery . Grate and fast service . I receive my order after 30 minutes driver was nice and friendly . Margarita pizza was hot and fresh . Great opportunity for late time delivery . Next time I will try pastas ."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Place the order for delivery and it's not even takes 30 min pizza hot and fresh finally I get what I wont, chicken Marsala was delicious. Nice friendly service . Five stars for sure."}
{"text":"I've came here (Putters) mostly for drinks. I decided to eat here as well today. Service was sub-par, even in just getting drinks. With Michelle and John I've had the best experiences, but tonight was short of that. The waitress was fine and good on service except for the bill. My bill was $9.72, she gave me $10 back of the $20 I gave her. Obviously 28 cents doesn't matter much, but it was the principle. Suggesting I wouldn't tip enough?  That the 28 cents would cover some type of loss?  Very uncomfortable and I won't order food again. Otherwise I'd only suggest this place for the night bartenders."}
{"text":"Gem in disguise! This is our new spot. Everything was delicious! Service was great. Try them out!"}
{"text":"Very good portions delivery was fast food tastes good i ordered a meatlovers pixza with wings and a philly"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for delivery through the online service was quoted an hour for delivery which was what I expected. But after about 45 min I got updates saying it was going to take longer. After an hour and 40 min I called and cancelled my order because I didn't have time to wait any longer. I was pretty disappointed I waited around and then didn't have time to eat before work."}
{"text":"Crust is  excellent, sausage was old borderline bad. Took over  an hour to get delivery was promised 45 minutes"}
{"text":"If I could I would leave no stars all we order was a grilled cheese a caesar salad and a slice of cake it took 1 hour and 10 minutes to get this INSANELY simple order and of course by the time we got the food the sandwich which was supposed to have tomato and basil was a soggy rubber plastic sandwich with steamed fries I will never make the mistake of ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Don't make the mistake of ordering from this place. It took close to 2 hours to receive my food via their delivery service. They were way past the time(45-60 minutes) quoted through Yelp. The Yelp customer service reps tried to help me but they couldn't get anyone on the phone with the restaurant either.   When it finally arrived the food was clearly almost 2 hours old. The food wasn't warm. The ranch dressing wasn't cold. Absolutely awful. It looked like bad bar food. The only reason I even tried this place is because it was late and the delivery options are limited. That was a mistake. I would've been better off buying a gas station hot dog."}
{"text":"I ordered bbq chicken pizza and i must day it was super good ! They delivered fast ! I will definitely be ordering again !"}
{"text":"Good pizza at a great price. The all meat pizza was loaded with toppings and hit the spot. The homemade lasagna was some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant inside putters, the wings are the best. They are the biggest and juiciest I've tried in town ! Friendly service. Love it! Wanna come back to try more stuff their pizza next."}
{"text":"10/27/2017 I've been coming here for over a year. ordered meatball on my pizza like I have done before. They lied and said it was meatball. Turns out the owner herself lied about it being meatball and they tried to put regular ground beef on it.  I have recently seen this place gone downhill with service for about a month now. I gave them plenty of chances to redeem themselves. Now they won't even give a refund. Save yourself the headache and go somewhere else. This is the last time I order here."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, do not order delivery. The delivery driver will deliver half your order then tell you it's your job to call to get it fixed then they will ask you to come in and get the items they forgot.   Contacted the restaurant and they said they'd call right back. Waited 20-30 mins and still no response.   I wish there was a zero star option because what food we received wasn't even warm.   You have been warned!"}
{"text":"This place is the true definition of HIT or MISS!!  If you hit the food is fresh, big portions, they don't usually charge for any additional ingredients or side changes and prices are what the food is worth. Delivery was very very fast and FREE!! And let's not forget they deliver late!!! Oh yes!! That's a hit in my Book! Oh wait....I forgot the MISS part...unfortunately  Is a BIG miss and happened twice and I saw other similar reviews  I called after 1.5 hours of wait to check on food. they're very busy but food already on the way. Ok cool I can totally understand that. No worries....Then another 30 minutes... So had to call back which I hate cuz I'm not a difficult customer they said they were unable to reach the driver!!! I said k I'll wait 15 more after that im not paying for it. They said we are really sorry. 30 minutes later and already filled up with a bunch of snacks the driver calls saying hi I'm outside with your food!!! Hell no!!j"}
{"text":"I love this place. Never have a problem with the staff and the food is excellent. I order from them about once a week.  They're not just great at pizza. I've literally been impressed at how well their fries hold up. A lot of other places, the fries are soggy and nasty by the time they arrive, but with Tony's, the fries are still excellent by the time they arrive over by Trop and Valley View. The buns for their burgers also stay dry enough you don't need a wrapper to eat by the time they arrive. I'm also really picky about alfredo, but their chicken alfredo is excellent.  Keep in mind this is a small place, so if one or two people call out, it really hits them hard and it can jack up the delivery times. Usually they can get to me in 45 minutes or less, though!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering delivery from Tony Big's Pizza N Pasta for about a year.  Without fail, their food is delicious every time!  My usual order is a pizza, mild chicken fingers & fries, and garlic balls with marinara.  The pizza is always hot and fresh upon delivery, chicken fingers are tender and moist, and garlic balls taste like little pillows of heaven.  For delivery, I'm usually quoted an hour, but food often arrives in 30-45 minutes!  How can you beat that? Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tony and bigs food is always good. The wings are great, the cheesesteaks are comparable to Philly, the pizzas & strombolis are great... I would definitely recommend   Great food inside a good local bar, two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Delivery time quoted was 50 minutes, food showed up in 30 and it's a Friday night.  Delicious fries (especially for the price!) and great stromboli!  A little surprised that the stromboli came with so much on it - I ordered meatball thinking it would just be meatball and cheese.  But it comes with ham, pepperoni, salami, cheese, and meatball.  It does say this on the menu, I guess I thought those were options.  Never had a stromboli come with all that on it before and I eat a lot of them!  But it still tastes great so fine with me.  Will definitely call again soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered via eat24 on two different occasions both of which said would take 30-45 minutes for delivery.  Shortly after placing the order you get a notification that they need more time to prepare your order. It actually took between an hour and half to an hour and forty five minutes for both deliveries. I would advise ordering ahead if you want your meal at a specific time.  The food was delicious (teriyaki burger, meatball sub, calamari, french fries & salad were all among items ordered). Can't wait to try the pizza and calzones."}
{"text":"I Love Love Love this place. It has officially become my new favorite pizza & past place. My friends and I decided to get a bite to eat after work. The location was great and the food was even better. The staff was really friendly and the environment was so clean and fun. The pizza was made to perfection. We had such a good time. We'll deffinetly be back for more!"}
{"text":"Thank you Tony's for offering late night delivery. I ordered after midnight for delivery, via the yelp eat24 app.I accidentally selected pick up instead of delivery. Called in to rectify the situation the customer service was pleasant enough. Order the mushroom Philly cheese steak, and margherita (sp) pizza. The ingredients in the pizza were definitely fresh but I could have done with out chomping down on a few twigs in my pizza. I requested roasted peppers on my cheese steak, they were not there. The fries-nothing to write home about, they could've kept them. The food is Mediocre at best, customer service, nice."}
{"text":"Called to make an order at 8PM they said it would be ready in an hour I go wow a hour okay maybe it's really good. I got there at 9PM server said 10-15 more minutes. I wait 30mins passes and she goes couple more minutes. At 9:50 I ask her what's going on she goes let me go back there and check...comes out 5 mins later and tells me oh he's having issues with the oven I'm not sure how much longer it will be. 9:55 I'm at McDonalds writing this review. Yup I'm pretty much not coming back.  Tip: Ask them if their oven works before you order. Zero stars if I could coz I really didn't get anything from them ZERO!"}
{"text":"First time there for dinner last night.  Got the 24\" pizza.  I thought it was excellent.  One of my top favorite places now.  Also, excellent service.  Will definitely be back soon.  BTW, I ordered directly instead of an app.  Spoke with Katie...very nice.  I don't like using apps for food."}
{"text":"Paid $23 for an 18inch pizza that the bottom is completely black. When i called to explain the situation with them steve argue with me that this is how a cook pizza is supposed to looked like. Then asked me \"What would you like for me to do?\" Well maybe provide a better customer service would be nice. If you know your food is not up to the standard then you shouldnt let it pass the kitchen in the first place. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Their food used to be so good but now we will never return because of the type of service that steve had provided."}
{"text":"I just ordered from this place for the very first time considering the fact that Eat24 recommended it saying that they will deliver and it will take at least 45 to 60 minutes. Knowing where it was located I thought I would take a shot.  They offered Coney Island style hot dogs which I've always loved especially from Sonic and I figured why not? I decided to complement the meal with some mozzarella sticks as well. Biggest mistake ever. The place took well over an hour and 20 minutes to finally arrive. When I called the restaurant after an hour of waiting to inquire about the status of my order, they told me \"Yes they should be there any second\". To me, 'any second' means less than five minutes which this was not. The order finally arrived twenty minutes after I made the call to the restaurant and taking a few bites of the hot dog I must say it is extremely bland.  I don't know, maybe the way I feel about having not received my meal as efficiently as promised contributed to this but the cheese is runny, the onions are extremely potent in their odor, the hot dogs taste rubbery, and the chili tastes like it came out of the can very thick and goopy, really no taste at all.  The mozzarella sticks leave much to be desired; not hot at all and the cheese inside of them, very rubbery and elasticy.  The french fries that they gave me, I didn't realize would come with the meal it almost seems like they were desperately trying to get me to be happy and say \"Here's something that everyone in America loves! French fries! No matter what, everyone loves french fries!  Nope, will not be ordering from this place again. I do not recommend, and again when it came to delivery, they showed up after an hour and 20 minutes. The gentleman at the door said nothing when I opened it. He just held out his arms towards me with the food in one hand and my soda cup in the other. No 'Hello' no 'Here's your order', just simply holding it up for me to take and when I took it, a quick 'So long' and he was gone. Real nice customer service...  Will not be ordering from nor will I be recommending this place to anyone ever again."}
{"text":"My family was super hungry at 11:50 pm, so I went through that Yelp Eat24 to see who delivered so late.  Tony Big's came up and I have to admit, I was a little concerned about ordering based on some of the reviews, but, hunger won so we ordered on-line.  About 10 minutes later we received a phone call from a very nice young lady who advised that there had been an error in my order.  She explained it, apologized and corrected everything on her end.  She also advised of the long wait for deliveries but they would try to be earlier.  WOW, 35 minutes later the delivery guy was at my door! Not only was the food hot and fresh, it was delicious!  We had cheese and pepporoni pizza, Bacon cheeseburger and chicken fingers.  My 15 year old, who is the PICKIEST eater EVER, had several pieces of pizza, then moved on to my fingers and my husbands burger!!  I am happy to say Tony Big's Pizza N Pasta gets 5 stars from this family!  Keep up the good work guys and I bet you will see a big difference in your Yelp score.  Thank you"}
{"text":"No problems with delivery time at all. Their lunch specials are great (at least the chicken fingers are on-point) but their fries are just so-so and their caesar salad was bad. Bad bad. Water thin dressing, oddly cooked slices of chicken breast with no seasoning, tiny little croutons. Gross.  Order their chicken fingers and enjoy. Stay clear of the rest."}
{"text":"Orederd wing and fries was surprise I normally go to Buffalo wings or Wingstop...just wanted to try it since its next to me.."}
{"text":"I've been on a search for a pizza worthy of my Chicago palette and I think I've found it.  Crust was perfect and a reasonable amount of toppings that wasn't overdone or skimpy.    Wings were surprisingly good and priced reasonably.  This is a great place to order from!"}
{"text":"Epic fail!!! Ordered from them, 2 hours later I get a call saying it was sent to a different restaurant when they only have 1 and it will be 45 minutes more. Then I wait and get nothing!!!!!!! They sure as hell took my money and delivered no product!"}
{"text":"The toppings and cheese were really good but  the pizza dough/crust was flat and not good at all."}
{"text":"Best pizza wings and fries I had in town! They told me 45 mins but got here in 30 mins! Good delivery service!"}
{"text":"Horrible delivery. I ordered a buffalo pizza with jalapeños and a large fry. The wait time was 45-60 mins it took them an hour and 17 mins (i always time with delivering). Plus on top of it all they didnt have the jalapeños which cost me 1.50$ extra and the pizza and fries were cold. If i could rate a quarter of a star i would for there delivery. Horrible. Never again"}
{"text":"Ordered using Eat24. One of the best places we have ordered from in a long time. Price was good. Delivery was fast just slightly over 30 mins. Food was delicious and most importantly the special requests where actually followed and the order was complete. Had the antipasto salad, the turkey blt and garlic bread. Garlic bread was the standard pizza place garlic bread but not bad. Partner loved his salad. We usually order from another just for that salad but I think we have a new place to order from. Can't wait to try more things from the menu.     **second time** forgot my salad but delivered the salad dressing. Ordered the chili cheese burger and if you don't like mayo on your burger don't order. Very disappointed. Not listed anywhere that it has mayo. So kind of gross. Hot sausage sub was just so so. Hope it's just a bad day for them but will be awhile before they get another chance."}
{"text":"Very very poor food.   Ordered postmates with this one. I was less than impressed.  Tonight I ordered chicken fingers hot with bleu cheese on the side, as well as an Italian sub with extra vinegar on the side.  Fingers were decent. Pretty straight forward with these.  Italian sub was mediocre at the very best. Soggy bread, quality of the ingredients were lacking and overall flavor of the sub was poorly executed.  I will not be ordering from them nor would I give the shot of going there to dine..  Blah"}
{"text":"I love the ribs here they make it perfect not over or undercooked. And the sauce is delicious. Party in my mouth!  Also I have tried the pizzas and they are super good! I tried it place a few times to be sure then I decided to write the review. Great place great food!"}
{"text":"Had a 11p.m. pizza craving and these guys were here for me. The garlic balls were fluffy like beignets and I could easily eat a million. The Margherita pizza was also yummy, and it reheats well the next day.  A+ pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to Mountains Edge and it came 10 minutes quicker than expected! Food was hot and bigger portions than expected! The Philly cheesesteak and chicken parmigiana was flavorful and well worth the price and they gave fresh garlic bread that was actually crispy when it arrived! I'll openly admit it's not the best I've ever had but to be straightforward it's a quick shop not a 5 star restaurant and you definitely get your money's worth! Definitely check them out if your looking for a late bite they're open til 2am!"}
{"text":"First of all there delivery driver was rude!  We had tipped him 10 dollars online. And he demanded a tip when he walked away saying thanks for the tip Rudely.  Second they got the pizza wrong they added pineapple on the pepperoni pizza. Third they did not give us the mac and cheese balls we ordered. They did not give us forks or napkins how would we eat our salad or fettuccine . We are never ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!! We made the mistake of ordering delivery from Tony's. It took them an hour and a half to deliver. When I called, their reasoning was that they had 15 orders, they were busy and that I could take my business elsewhere. I most definitely will!  Not to mention, the pizza that came was cold on delivery. Never again!"}
{"text":"I liked this place, we have ordered here pretty regularly over the last 6-9 months. We've only had super slow delivery on one occasion, usually the food is arriving within an hour and most of the food is really good, large portions. Recently though, the quality has dipped and I'm no longer so eager to order from them. The chicken in the chicken parmesan is awful, I think they must be microwaving it to melt the cheese or something because it shows up with a rubbery texture. Mostly recently, they forgot the chili on the bacon dog - super disappointing. Time before that they didn't even bother to wrap the bacon on the bacon hotdog. Their pesto pasta is terrible - dont even bother. If we do decide to order from them again, they are one more bad dish away from being off my list for good."}
{"text":"I ordered online through Eat24 and never received my food. I called them and asked where it was and she said she would call the driver. I hear nothing for 30 minuets and then she calls me back  and tells me the drivers phone died and couldn't finish my delivery. She asked if I wanted them to re make my food and have it delivered like I have all the time in the world. Very frustrating! I didn't end up having time to eat before work."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here and I've got to say this place is amazing! The driver got here and our pizza was messed up and he immediately went back to the restaurant to get us a brand new one and added on extra for us! Although it was an extra wait time, he was very nice and I know accidents happen he kept letting us know and updating us about our new order! He deserves a raise or something no delivery driver has ever been that polite! I highly recommend ordering from here the food is great!"}
{"text":"Ordered through grubhub. Took about an hr to deliver but that's what was expected. Got a pepperoni pizza that had no flavor at all. Wings were ehhh. Not too much flavor either but we're decent at best. Definitely wouldn't order again."}
{"text":"I seem to be ordering quite a bit of pizza these days with two teenagers and all of their friends in my house.  The pizza is tasty but the garlic knots are INCREDIBLE!  Service has always been fast and my order has always been correct.  If you use a credit card to order, you will have to show it when the driver delivers."}
{"text":"I did not expect late jight pizza delivety to be this good. There pizza was very good. In fact it was bestndelivery i had in soring valley area in a wild. Amazing white oizza and pep. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Hot sandwiches here are good so I decided to try their pasta dinners and was extremely disappointed, no flavor and low quality and cost the same as a large restaurant.  Very disappointing."}
