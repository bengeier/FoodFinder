The menu is deep and slowly changing as he tries new things. I am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future. 

Awesome value and neat touches to his food like blowtorch sushi."}

{"text":"Tried this new place on Roncesvalle and was pleasantly surprised! Very fresh sushi, and I believe even torched for the lunch combo which is an amazing deal given the price point. Only downside is that it's cash and debit only, like many restaurants in this area.  I have returned several times since then. Definitely recommend!"}

We'll definitely be back for more."}
