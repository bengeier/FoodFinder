{"text":"The sushi is fantastic and the staff is kind.  It's a great restaurant.I recommend it"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They have an amazing selection of sushi and everything I have tried has been outstanding. Some of the sushi even comes out on fire. My wife has enjoyed the chicken teriyaki both times she has had it. The staff is friendly and engaged and clearly want to ensure you have the best experience. You should definitely give it a try.  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Loved it!!  We ordered seafood soon tofu and chicken Katsu.  Both were very delicious!! I am so excited that we have restaurant that serves both Korean and Japanese dishes.  I am ready to go back and will try sushi next time."}
{"text":"Just wow!!! Coming from a fellow Asian here. The sushi tasted authentic, the ambience reminded me of motherland."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've enjoyed everything from the appetizer through the end of a meal. I can happily say I did here!! Excellent Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"My family went to Wasabi and had a wonderful experience. Everything from the appetizers to the dessert was great and the food is interesting not the same old Americanized Japanese fare.  The owners were very interested in making our experience great and it was. We were all impressed and had a very enjoyable time!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place. The food is delicious, the portions are generous, and the staff is friendly and fun. Try it. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the staff was super nice! We stopped on our way home from a baseball tournament and it was at the end of the evening for them but that didn't change their treatment of us! 5 star!"}
{"text":"I thought the place had a nice look and decent atmosphere but the food wasn't especially great. Not terrible but not great. The reason I'm giving this two instead of three stars is when we got the bill I felt the price did not justify what we got. Yes, I'm aware price is on the menu. In summary, food was average. Price too high. Probably would go again but no rush."}
{"text":"Baked salmon roll was terrific! Heart attack roll was very good also.   Service was super nice and attentive.  Will certainly come back."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Wassabi's. A couple of my friends and I dined here because one of them told me about it, and living in the Charlotte area and having had sushi from a great many Japanese restaurants, I would have to say that Wassabi knows how to throw down on some fantastic tasting sushi. Service there was great, inside aesthetics were definitely pleasing, especially the mural in the back, and well, the sushi was on point! If you like spicy, Mafia roll. Spicy and fried, then the heart attack. Fried calamari was awesome, especially with the dip it came with, having a sweet and spicy tang to it. Stuffed fried jalape√±os were on point, and the dessert, red bean ice cream with a little bit of strawberry syrup on top, it was just what was needed to top off the night. If you love sushi, live in Gastonia, or even live 20 minutes away like I do, this place is worth it! Will definitely be back for another visit!"}
{"text":"So this is a Korean and Japanese restaurant. There was a very young attentive gentleman who greeted us and was very likeable. We started with the shu mai which was good. I forgot to take pics until after we finished it! I ordered the bulgogi which came with rice and was absolutely delicious! The beef was tender, flavorful and abundant! We got a plate with kimchi, bean sprouts and potato. I've never had potato in a Korean restaurant before! I wasn't very crazy about it though Hubby got the crazy coconut rolls that were out of this world! They had cream cheese in them that took it over the top! A must try!! We were too stuffed for dessert! I suspect that this will become a favorite place for me!"}
{"text":"Was on the way to Jai's but they were super packed. Didn't want to go to far out for Japanese either so we decided to stop here. The food was phenomenal and the staff was super friendly and helpful! Will return!"}
{"text":"Family was headed to Jais where we usually eat Japanese. We saw Wassabi's on our way decide to stop in. We were not disappointed. This place has a great atmosphere and the wait staff was great. Had the tempura calamari light, crisp, and delicious. The dipping sauce went perfect with it. I had the regular Bim Bob it was great. My wife had the tempura udon. The noodles were perfectly cooked. My oldest daughter had the spicy pork. It again was light and the spicy did not over powered the pork. The youngest had a shrimp bento too much food for her. This place is our new go to. You can tell this place put a lot of attention and care into their food and staff."}
{"text":"The sushi here makes this place a surprise find on our travels. Even the soy sauce is different (house made) and it was so good. We've been a few times now and haven't really made it past the sushi menu, because the Temptation Roll keeps calling my name. We were in town visiting from the St. Louis and ended up eating most of our meals here, not only was it good but the prices were amazing for what you get."}
{"text":"This is a new spot in Gastonia we came not knowing it was their soft opening. They have a HUGE selection of sushi, so if you like sushi this is the place to come to. And the menu breaks down the types of sushi so nicely for someone who doesn't know much about it. They also have traditional Japanese dishes like teriyaki chicken, comes with soup and salad. But they also have some Korean dishes as well. The stay is soooo nice! They even gave us a free appetizer, lemonade looked like hand squeezed. I order the firework sushi and it came out literally on fire! So cool! The owners or managers and servers came out to make sure we were enjoying ourselves multiple times and explained what we were eating. They even brought out some extra things for us to try."}
{"text":"Being a recent transplant from Florida, I was having a rough time finding vegetarian options in the area. I'm pleased to say that Wassabi has come to my rescue! They have a decent selection of vegetarian sushi and they even have a crunchy vegetarian sushi which is amazing!  For the meat eaters out there, my husband said his sushi was great and the soups were awesome too. He had the pork tonkatsu and said that was really nice too!  They're a great place to go. Staff is great, food has always been delicious, and atmosphere is really nice! My only advice would be to add some traditional ramens to the menu and maybe a vegetarian one too since the closest place to get a vegetarian ramen is in the city and always packed! :)"}
{"text":"What a great place. We had driven by this place several times and decided to stop and try it. I'm glad we did. It's a mix of Japanese and Korean, so we tried both. I had the teriyaki beef, my husband had the Bulgogi Bento Box.  Both were perfect.  The staff was incredibly friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant.  I can't get over how nice the place is, we love the decor.  We will definitely be back. Before I wrap up, I have to say one more time how pleasant and friendly the staff was. Thank you for an enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"First time visiting Wassabi not disappointed at all the food, service, atmosphere and price were great. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Food and service were really good. Love the atmosphere. Great selection of sushi! Benito boxes are really good. I've also tried the beef and chicken teriyaki served beautifully and different than anywhere else I have ever eaten.  Amazing fried cheesecake served with a raspberry sauce and whipped cream with chocolate drizzles! YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Ate tonight at Wasabi tonight. I cannot express how great everything is!  The service is wonderful and oh the food is fresh and tasty. I had the Korean BBQ and it was so tasty.  Michelle and Adam shared the Wasabi boat and they raved about it. The picture doesn't do the boat justice as it was as long as the table. I will not comment on how much my wife and son can consume.  You need to get out and try this place.  Wow!!"}
{"text":"Food and service were both great!  Restaurant looks beautiful after the remodel.  Duy was very friendly and helpful!!"}
{"text":"A solid soft opening for the new Japanese restaurant in town. Phenomenal sushi. I am slowly working through the menu through my last two visits. A nice atmosphere and good music to settle you in while they work in the menu. My son does not do shrimp and crab, so our options are a little smaller, but still brilliant. Our favorite is the fire dragon roll. We call also vouch for jj's roll as well, though it took a little skill to eat without the topping falling off. The surprise for me was the heart attack roll. I typically don't like fried rolls, but this was the perfect level of just enough heat to make it sing. I have this place as my new staple and look forward to more awesomeness."}
{"text":"January 14th First trip to Wasabi, New Hope rd, Across from USPS center. Never been one to eat raw anything, but I did try ONE raw, the cooked ones I loved.... My dish was cooked steak and chicken with rice, lol. I'm just not looking for death by stomach. Maybe one day I'll be more into it, but right now.......it's only the cooked ones for me. The truth is, this is art on a plate You won't find a better local place if you love Sushi, and I don't know of anywhere else I want to eat Japanese right now, that's sad huh?"}
{"text":"We tried Wasabi tonight and were very pleasantly surprised. The sushi rolls and sashimi were fresh and delicious. We usually drive into Charlotte for sushi, but now have a local option. Friendly staff and clean too. We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Our family of 7 met here for lunch. My husband and I having drove in from OBX. Having spent several years in Japan I can say this food is definitely authentic Japanese. What makes this stand out is how incredibly fresh everything is. Dipping sauces are homemade and unique.  Wait Staff are wonderfully attentive and helpful. Between all of us we were able to sample gyoza, yakisoba, chicken teriyaki bento box, miso soup, spring rolls and a variety of sushi rolls.  I initially thought the sushi rolls were pricey but after seeing them not so. They are much larger rolls than many other places serve. The Firecracker roll was a personal favorite. It took sushi to a new level. Can't wait till we are back this way again and can return."}
{"text":"Excellent staff, like the remodeled interior, their Japanese quinine is great, like the take on bento, excellent sushi selection!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoyed a Sunday dinner here and it was fabulous. It was our first time here. The food was outstanding. I got the bento box and it was a crazy amount of food and well worth the money! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Spring break looking for some sushi. Decided to give Wassabi a try. Was not disappointed.  Ordered 3 speciality rolls and they were all great. We came towards the end of their lunch service so basically the only table left. Service was great. Rolls were delicious. Definitely will be back to try some of the Korean menu items."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service was even better. Will be returning. We had the fireworks roll and it was awesome. Love the Bento boxes and fried Oreos!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with the family and a very good experience, the staff was friendly and attentive while the food was very good it was definitely enhanced by the staff. Had Sashimi which was fresh and spicy pork and yake soba, no complaints at all."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Wassabi. My younger son and I have Celiac Disease so we have to avoid gluten. Our waiter, Hyuntae, guided us through the menu and talked to the chef to make sure our food was prepared without gluten. We shared a rainbow roll that was fantastic! Very fresh fish. We each had a Bi Bim Bob which was delicious. My older son had beef yaki udon and my mother had chicken Katsu. The portions were huge and everything was fresh and delicious.  My new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"This was a shocker !! The sushi is amazing !! I can't say enough about the amazing sushi rolls ! You have to go and try if you like sushi you'll love their unique rolls!!!  I had ramen which was ok but the sushi was the best"}
{"text":"The best sushi you can find locally! We've tried several places and usually eat at Lotus but the quality and freshness, not to mention exceptional service, far exceeded our expectations. We will be making this our new go to place for Japanese - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever eaten. Hands down. Beautiful restaurant and friendly staff. I wish we lived closer. I'd eat here every day."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and we loved it. First was the excellent service. They were so friendly and accommodating. We had the shrimp tempura along with the shrimp bento box. The portions were also generous. Everything they brought looked and tasted excellent. We will definitely be frequenting here. The prices range from about $12 to $16 for a bento box or a large plate and it very reasonable and definitely worth it. Higly recommend everyone try it at least once."}
{"text":"Me and my mother-in law wanted some take out so we decided to give this place a try. All I can say is that I wish we would've dined in. The service was impeccable, the waitress was so sweet and the owner introduced himself to us. The best part about this is the food of course.  Great for family dining and date nights."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try and glad I did! Great food, nice decor, and good service. Got free sushi app from the sushi chef which was delicious. The beef soon tofu soup was perfect for the chilly days. My sister and I also loved the beef udon yaki (must try). Good job Wassabi, keep it up. Will be coming back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Great food great service and great atmosphere!!! Jay was awesome!!! We ordered the fireworks (fire), Yum Yum, Crazy Crab, Lobster And Crab roll. There was enough food for everyone. I can't stress enough how pleased i was with everything. This is a must visit restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I've been a couple times now with smaller parties and a large party and no complaints! The staff is so helpful and happy to serve you, some are still newer but try and still give great service. The sushi portions are huge and for a great price. The Korean main dishes are amazing too, I have yet to have a bad meal here. If you want a good dessert the red bean ice cream is so good. We will be back a lot, great place!"}
{"text":"We had ordered the bulgogi lunch box for lunch today and it was great! The tempura was perfect! It was crunchy and crisp... not greasy at all! The soup was perfect, salad was delicious. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Still great food, but a big surprise today. Egg rolls have been added to the menu, served with a homemade spicy sweet duck sauce. Really good!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. I loved the Bento box. Their biggest issue was the waitstaff understanding how to split a check.  One bill, two credit cards, through them for a loop. Math was nobody strong point that day.  Back to the food. good miso soup... the tempura was scrumptious.  I would eat a bowl of it and just be happy. Maybe some sake with it.  I'm going to give them three stars for now. I'll go back and keep you guys in the loop"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Not a good experience. Waitress was new. No soy pots for Edamame and I never got my salad or soup until all food came. Lettuce was brown. My son ordered the seared tuna salad and it just came on a plate with no lettuce or seasonings. He enjoyed the salmon nigiri and the tuna. Finally the tap water tasted like they got it out of a sewer. Never again!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in town, the food is outstanding!  The menu makes Korean food and sushi accessible to my less adventurous food friends. There service is next level!  Every server seems capable of anticipating my needs."}
{"text":"Our food was SO GOOD! we had a bit of everything we had the fire work sushi it was really good had a bit of smoky taste and was a bit spicy too! We also had chicken teriyaki and the portion for the price was great! Really enjoyed our food and also enjoyed our waiter Tay he was very sweet and very on the ball with everything we needed all in all this place was excellent and we will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed in this place after reading so many reviews. I should have had red flags when on a Friday night it was less than half full when most restaurants in Gastonia are scrambling for extra seats. While the service was solid it was the food that was the true let-down. We ordered one of the sushi rolls that arrives to the table still on fire. Yes, it was very impressive, but once I tasted it there was no appeal. It kinda tasted like they used imitation crab, or something else. Something about the taste was just off. I ordered the udon noodles thinking it was going to be udon soup, but I must have read the menu wrong because it was stir-fry. The menu just said it had vegetables, but didn't specify what kind. I was pretty frustrated when it was bell peppers and onions (not something I like) so I just ate around them. My husband said his order was pretty average, and we both left wishing we had ate at a different asian restaurant."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to check this place out in early June.  It was okay but could not imagine any type of Chinese, Japanese, or Asian style not have hot or spicy mustard. It was at least clean and the stag was courteous. Food was ok but they are new and this make take a while....."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on Valentine's Day.  Very nice atmosphere. The sushi was delicious!!"}
{"text":"If only we didn't live far from Wassabi, we would become regulars. Stopped here on our way through the Charlotte area. The best sushi place I've been to in North Carolina. The Firecracker roll was amazing, subtly smoky. The bento boxes were huge and every element was tasty. Husband says the Sushi special was delicious. Looking forward to the next trip through Gastonia."}
