{"text":"Nice location, pretty good food, solid service and decent prices! Very close to the water!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service, very attentive server."}
{"text":"My wife and I have dined at Port City 5 times now since it has opened. Service has been above average each time, and the food has equally met expectations. When a restaurant sets a standard based on their presentation, I think it is important to consider that when rating it.   That said, Port City does a great job meeting the expectations that it sets, and we will continue to come back. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"After reviewing Port City Club a few days ago based on an excellent lunch, I had dinner there with my wife on a busy Friday night.  Obviously the place is doing very well, because the restaurant was packed.  But, to accommodate its popularity they have lined tables up ridiculously close to one another.  We had tables on either side of us that were 14-15\" away.  We were unable to carry on any kind of private conversation.  The waiters either reach over the person sitting with their back to the room, or squeeze between the tables with their butt hanging over the table.  I have never seen anyplace, even in New York City, put tables this close.  Maybe the crowd indicates that customers are willing to put up with this, but I am not.  I might try a weeknight to see if that is more comfortable, because the food is very good, but this was not a good experience."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. The food for each of the 6 members of our party was outstanding. From perfectly cooked steak, to fresh seafood, to excellent pasta, this place does it right."}
{"text":"The food is good but reflectioins of the sun were not so good, first is was the sun reflecting off a steel piece of equipment maybe a dink dispenser or something, and later is was the sun reflection through one of the window portals in the wall over looking the lake.    There are no shades that can be closed to get rid of the reflections into someones face.  It was my unfortunate lot in life to sit at the wrong table in that restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an amazing dinner here. The view is also great and all lit up in the evening with heaters on the outside patio. Good service. Loved the charcuterie. Decent prices. Lake views!!!!"}
{"text":"Great view. 2 hours to get food. Seriously Port City. Really. This happens every time I am here. And I've come here all too often for 5 months because you are lakefront, that's it. Shame on me now. North Harbor Club is where I will go from now on. Well done. You have lost multiple other locals for the same lack of service you offer."}
{"text":"If you want elegance and a view of the lake, this is the place!  Food is terrific; you an eat indoors or on the climate controlled patio, good for business/pleasure/groups, just about the best Caesar's salad I've had, scrumptious & decadent desserts, and a really nice experience.  Pricey but worth it for the view and gourmet food prep.  Convenient location.  Friendly servers.  My one complaint is that there are a bunch of items that aren't available until after 4:00."}
{"text":"Great prices, great service, great food....and awesome view of the lake. What else could you ask for? Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Service was good...chicken was RAW. Calamari was the best of the entire meal. First time...won't go back."}
{"text":"I'll begin by saying that my meal, the ravioli, and my husband's meal, the lobster roll, were great, but that's about all that was great.  The service was slow and inattentive.  At one point I dropped my mixed drink, which was very loud, you would have thought the glass shattered into a million pieces, which thankfully, it did not break.  Not one person came over to help clean it up or see what happened.  I even saw at least one guy at the bus boy station, which was right next to our table!!  So, I cleaned it up and when the waitress finally came back over we told her my drink fell and asks for another.  A top notch restaurant would have done this at no charge.  Not this place.  Then, we decided to have dessert, the chocolate 7 layer cake, which was hideously overpriced at $12.  It left much to be desired.  For one, she should have asked us if we wanted the raspberry sauce on it.  She never asked, so it was drizzled all over it.  If you don't like raspberry, that will ruin it for you, as it did for my husband.  I could tolerate it. Bottom line, we kind of felt like just a job, not actually a welcomed customer.  Will never go back again."}
{"text":"Went during the week. Wasn't busy. Took about 10 minutes for the waiter to greet us and take drink orders. Two people ordered pasta. I ordered a club. Another person ordered the chicken breast.   Both pasta dishes were cold. My club was unremarkable.   Chicken was good.   Waiter disappeared for 25 minutes.  2/5. Won't come here again."}
{"text":"I dined at port city club last night with two friends. The food was great! I got the filet with potatoes and vegetables and I loved it. The steak was reasonably priced and cooked just the way I like it. My friends ordered the eggplant parmesan and the chicken and both enjoyed their meals. The location was beautiful inside and out, but there was a long wait for the patio.   The only downside was the service was not as great as I would hope it to be. Refills were slow and one glass was dirty. However, nothing major. Overall I really enjoyed my meal and will be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here last week and I was totally impressed by the overhaul of the former restaurant, Midtown Sundries.   The whole atmosphere is so much cleaner and this restaurant has the best view of the lake and plenty of outdoor seating. You can sit outdoor under a covered deck, outside under umbrellas or outside on beach sand right at the lake. I was totally impressed.   Now the important stuff the food and drinks!  The waitress went on and on about the bartender and I was not let down. They know how to make a great martini!  Very important!  I ordered the fish tacos and they were excellent!  I hope to go back as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"We eat here about once every three weeks. I have enjoyed the food since the day they opened! I wish Port City would broaden their selection of comfort foods though. I think there is only one hamburger on the menu. The bison burger is good if you like bison. The flat bread pizzas are a good value too and large compared to some I have seen. The negatives I have have nothing to do with the food. If I was the owner trying to establish and maintain a high end restaurant, I would pay attention to other details like no ashtrays in front of the building. All the smokers throw their cigarette butts on the ground on the front porch. Put several ashtrays stands out there! Same with the sand area out back. There are no cig stands so everyone throws their butts in the sand or in the gas fire pits on the lava rocks. Many of ropes on the sidewalk leading to the boardwalk and the ropes along the boardwalk are broken and laying on the ground. The lamps on the posts are broken and seen their last days. The shrubbery out back on the condo side of the building has grown to the roof against the side of the building. Hey, make this place look like the classy place you want it to be! Appearance is hugely important! The food is good though."}
{"text":"Unbelievable value!  Food is phenomenal and choices are \"anything you want\". View of lake is perfect but the reason to go is the food and the service. THE BEST FOOD and it's not expensive. You can have a $2.50 beer, $5.00 glass of good wine but the best food really at the lake by far. This owner knows what he's doing. Recommend meatball appetizer, tried both sauces and can't decide which is better. We had the beer-a-misu which sounds terrible but it is THE best dessert I have ever tasted ever, and that is saying something!  After living in NYC for 6 years. I am spoiled, but honestly, everything we tasted was better than any other place in Charlotte!! This is a MUST go to place!"}
{"text":"Amazing place, twice now I've been here. The food is 5 star, and the process are that of any olive garden (if not better) the drinks are rich, no watering down. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The chef's creations are delicious and creative.  The menu has a wide range of selections.   I tried the fish tacos which were light and delicious.   Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal.   There were so many delicious looking things on the menu that I will definitely be back.   It was worth our 30 minute drive to get there.  I'd recommend sitting on the lovely heated patio overlooking the lake.  It was very comfortable heat-wise during a winter's day.   It is also charming that locals can park their boats right on the dock outside and come in for a meal."}
{"text":"Food good , atmosphere better, after an easy 15 times here the service is so bad I may not be back again. Unfriendly , slow, borderline rude"}
{"text":"Great spot but be careful for the rough n' tough boat cops. I was doing idle to 3mph when leaving and got a ticket. I don't think they have gas, but not sure. I am sure that this place gets really good in the summer, so this review is just too early (and an excuse to complain about a ticket). Good beer, good food, nice people."}
{"text":"It is a nice place, but the consistency with their food/menu have never measured up to be anything but ok, and that is all I can say about this  overpriced, bad food,  nice location."}
{"text":"Location is the best thing about this restaurant. Food was fine, nothing exceptional. The service was bad. It may have just been our server , but it was like she was on another planet. I give this place 6/10"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the location is terrific ,however the waitstaff and management on duty the night we ate there were either indifferent or inexperienced.  We were a party of eight and ordered appetizers, expensive meals, numerous bottles of wine and drinks.  The waitress had difficulty opening the wine bottles with the corkscrew, obviously hadn't done it too often. She tried hard and we worked with her but the food came out very haphazardly with big waits for some of us after others had gotten their meals.  After our dinner we wanted to sit outside for an after dinner drink but the staff removed all the cushions telling us that rain was predicted. Not sure what forecast they were looking at but suspect people wanted to get out of there early.  By the way it didn't rain for two days.  Also made to wait at least 20 minutes, we did not have a reservation but the place was not busy at all Not sure how long they have been there but if management doesn't improve they could blow this great location."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly, food is okay, and drink selection is great. HOWEVER, this place has soooo much more potential if the property was well maintained. Just the basic preventive and routine maintenance would make this a more desirable place to hangout."}
{"text":"Terrible service food is not worth the wait . Go to rudder   Owner was onsite and rude I had shrimp and scallops 3 of each for 23 dollars don't waste your time or money"}
{"text":"Cannot beat the location and service  but the food is completely uninspired. High quality, but nothing that excites. Spend $100 on lunch for 5 people (3 were young kids) and felt it was a waste. Bug in water glass at start of meal and dried lipstick on beer glass midway through lunch didn't help."}
{"text":"I usually do not write an uncomplimentary review. I have tried this restaurant on three different occasions, twice for lunch and once for dinner. My first experience was for lunch. I waited at a table for 30 minutes without being served water or bread.  I finally left without eating lunch. My second lunch experience I ordered a fish sandwich that looked like a square piece of Ms. Paul's fish. It was disguised under slaw, tomato, and lettuce. A lunch for 2 was close to $50.  My dinner experience was not much better. My husband and I decided to split an order or scallops and shrimp. I have never seen such a small portion and the dinner was not split before bringing it to our table. The food was fair, nothing to get excited about. I think I have given this place my last chance. It is a shame such a lovely restaurant on the lake has such low standards."}
{"text":"I'm rating this restaurant before I even have dinner. We've been here multiple times and I chose not to critique the poor service the last time we were here...hoping it was just an off night. Tonight we had a reservation for 7 people and were seated right away. After sitting for 10 minutes without seeing a server, I had to go to the hostess stand and ask if we could at least get some water. Our server finally showed up, did not introduce himself, did not greet us, did not even smile. We had to ask him to tell us the specials and I finally asked him if he would please tell us his name. I would highly recommend you not be seated in Rob's section because you are in for a wait with a server with NO personality. I have never felt so unwelcome at a restaurant.  I am amending my review a little. While Rob did not start speaking to us until we were almost through with dinner, he did, at least, start acting like he liked his job. Having said that, the food was delicious. The table ordered crab toast, calamari and chicken livers for appetizers. All of them were terrific (well I didn't try the livers on principle but those who did loved them). The Halibut special was so good as was the Club, the  oysters on the half shell and the salads with the fried oysters. We keep coming for the food! I wish we could be as enthusiast for the service."}
{"text":"Beautiful view, delicious food and superb service ! Manager was extremely pleasant and welcoming as well.. Can't beat drinks by the shore !"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were starving last night and went to Port City Club for dinner. We ordered the Calamari and flat bread Margharita as appetizers, then I had the grilled Salmon topped with Crabmeat wich was grilled to perfection and my daughter had the Filet Mignon which came out at the right temperture. The fried calamari portion was huge, it was very tasty but for my taste it could've been slighty lighter on the coating. The flat bread also very generous, we couldnt finish it brought half home! Lol it was delicious. The Salmon's portion is fine and the crab meat generous. The wine and caper sauce was sumptous. I was in the Catering and Events business for over 20 years. I do not take reviews lightly because I can be critical. My daughter is an avid Filet Mignon consumer and she enjoyed hers. Although, I must add, side portions  weren't as generous considering the side dishes are $3.00 dollars extra. I think because we were so hungry if we only would've had the entrees we would've still been hungry! Lol Special Note: Pam our server was awesome! She totally rocks. Service is my number one pet peeve being an Event Planner who was also a Customer Service Trainer for a 4 star Hotel for years. I think we can say Port City Club is a keeper. Plus, you cant beat the Water Views if youre there for lunch or for cocktails. Especially with Spring & Summer around the corner. Make sure you visit soon!"}
{"text":"In my previous review, the restaurant had a lot of quirks to work out. Now, I am very happy to say it has become a top notch restaurant on Lake Norman. The food is consistently fantastic, the service is much better, and they are so busy (instead of a ghost town) that on Friday and Saturday nights a reservation is recommended. This is our go-to restaurant for great food on the Lake! Congratulations Port City!"}
{"text":"Probably our favorite restaurant in the area. Great food great prices and always a fun environment. We've never had anything we didn't like and you can't beat the beautiful patio views of LKN any time of the year. When our family comes to visit from NYC this is always their first choice for dinner, sometimes even twice in one week!"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and each time the food is just mediocre. I heard the cheese plate was fantastic and expected more but found it to be less than average and served with butterfly crackers that I typically feed my children. The plates and silverware were dirty and the menus were pretty dirty as well. The place has a prime location, but is lacking in cleanliness and presentation."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. Got the Cobb salad and the avocados were hard and tasteless. The bacon tasted like it was out of a bag. Blech. The service was slow. Our waiter was inexperienced. When he refilled our water glasses he kept touching the pitcher to all the water glasses. So you're basically spreading germs from person to person. There were fingerprints and smudges all over the glass doors. Disgusting. I would not go back."}
{"text":"The new \"It Spot\" on LKN!!   They've done an excellent job revamping the atmosphere. Wicker sofas on the sand, classy new interior and a coffee bar.  Very happy to have a great new spot in the neighborhood. Wide variety on the menu, the flatbreads bring me back to Europe."}
{"text":"I had a friend recommend Port City Club today. After seeing these reviews I was extremely hesitant to dine here. What a mistake that would have been. One of the memorable lunches of a lifetime. From the Oysters & Shrimp Cocktail, to the Lamberger, Fish Taco (Mahai) and the yellow fin tuna our party of 3 enjoyed every tasty morsel!  We topped it off sharing the Coconut Cake to die for with a couple of hazelnut cappuccino's that would put Starbucks to shame!  Caitlin was our server and she was attentive, helpful and friendly all in one!  Bravo to the entire experience!  If you're even close to this place, all I can say is get here!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant that offers everything for everybody. Food and drinks super. Staff needs work do next time I visit we'll see. Nice spot too"}
{"text":"Horrible food and service.  Hostesses were very inexperienced, bathrooms were dirty, and table service was terrible.  We had to ask multiple times for basic things, clean table, silver ware.  Scallops had grit and weren't edible, mahi was over done.  I feel like the quality keeps getting worse every time we go."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, excellent atmosphere. We will go back again.  Everyone at the table got something different and everyone was happy. Our sever, Julie, was attentive and friendly.  We went by boat and found ample parking at the dock.  We were not rushed and the food and check arrived in good time."}
{"text":"Have visited Port City on a number of occasions.  Each being hit or miss.  Here is a multi-million dollar property, with the potential to be a outstanding lake side restaurant.  Each visit has been tainted by incredibly poor attention to detail, either by the Wait staff or the food itself.  The price structure is one you may expect to pay while enjoying the view on the lake, but honestly the food never reaches those price points in dining.  Each time we have visited we have had to introduce ourselves to the waiter or waiter.  Each time asking to know what the specials are.  Our last visit was at lunch time.  We ordered the Baked brie to start.  It was serve uncooked on a small platter with a small(maybe 6 Pepperidge Farm Crackers).  On the plate the fruit compote was actually some type of fruit jam.  As we scrapped the hardened Brie from the dried crust we asked for some more crackers or maybe a smidge of warm bread-our waitress sorry \"got no mor\" and walked away.  Next to the Club sandwiches we asked them to be serve with their special potato salad side. Special indeed, the potatoes were not completely cooked and the only seasoning to the flavor was the watery mayonnaise they happened to brushed over the rock hard potatoes.  The Club consisted of cheap deli meat, nothing fresh or even high end attempts were made at the meat.  The sandwich had been thoroughly and completely dipped in some type of oil and fried on the grill. So much so the we had to ask for additional napkins to keep up with the removal of the oil from our hands. After a few small greasy bites we asked for our check. Our Waitress whom we had flagged down by standing up, came up and said \"didn't like it much\" we said no and she took or credit card for payment.  By the way never had a refill on any beverages.  We figured her time was better well spent talking with the guys working near the bar outside, since this appear to be where she spent most of her time.  I wish them well at Port City. Just not at my expense."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent atmosphere. Love being able to dine on the lake. One of our favorites at Lake Norman."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT.  The yellow tale tuna appetizer is over the top as well as the rib eye.  My wife had grouper, it was excellent. They mix a great martini, their wine selection is good and the customer service in general is very, very good.  This place blows 131 Main off the map.  I am so glad I found a place that is well priced, nice and serves REAL food, in big portions.  Place is GREAT."}
{"text":"Always a favorite of ours. Today we decided to bring our friends along. Amazed by the food and views , everyone will always return. Sophie was our server and she was very attentive and nice. Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Port City Club in Cornelius, North Carolina.   This lakefront restaurant is located on Lake Norman, where you can drive, walk or boat to your meal.   Dora here. How have we not discovered this gem sooner? What a glorious day for sitting outside! Everybody else agreed with us. Port City Club offers generous seating inside and three different levels outside, including one covered. What a gorgeous, relaxing setting for any meal.  For my meal, I chose the Lobster and Shrimp Roll. Maine lobster, poached shrimp, scallion, basil, and mayo served on a New England style split roll. Huge and meaty with just the right amount of mayo, this sandwich was outstanding and matched any meal that I enjoyed during our visit to Maine.  Dora here. I opted for the Port City Club, grilled chicken, bacon and smoked Gouda on a brioche roll. Delish! Tender, moist, and jazzed with a garlic aioli, I'd definitely go back for a repeat.   The service was attentive, friendly and flawless. Not once did our tea or water glass drain, and every time a server walked by, used items were scooped from the table with a smile. It's the perfect location for brokering business deals, families with active children, and couples looking for a romantic setting.   We rate this restaurant 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Myself and 4 friends went tonight to look around  and taste some of the food for a wedding rehearsal/reception venue. It was amazingly beautiful and offered everything we were looking for. The food was delicious. We ordered a flatbread to start, the broma,  it was yummy! Then we all had amazing dishes....salmon, half roasted chicken, mahi, and a pasta dish. The food and service was great, everyone was very attentive and accommodating. The manager came over and checked on us. Overall, this place is set back off the main road but definitely a hidden gem on Lake Norman!! Can't wait for the summer to take the boat over!"}
{"text":"We wanted a date night on the water for the romance factor and the beautiful sunset. It was a very hot night mind you but when the people inside are fanning them self I realized it didn't matter if we sit in or out, we sat out on the covered deck which over looked another uncover decks hat if you wanted an umbrella they would get you one,  which over looked a sand area with what looked like a nice waiting area with padded rattan chairs, everything looked like a restoration hardware pic, very pretty to look at but here it goes I am 5'2 and my chair couldn't reach the table so I had about a 10\" gap between me and the table and the chairs are completely hard wicker with no padding what so ever so after about 10 min your tuckus and back start to hurt! The small ceiling fans are a bit useless since the ceilings are about 15', they have long drape in the sides of gigantic open windows but they are for show not to actually block the setting sun.  Our waitress came over pretty quick, asked us if what we would like for drinks and then proceeded to leave, I called her back with an excuse me and she came back I had to ask her about the specials and her name. They were out of two of the local craft beers that we really love so we tried an unfamiliar and it was just ok.  Everything we ordered to eat came within 5-15 min of ordering, very questionable? I ordered a grilled chicken Cobb salad and balsamic dressing,  I could not change the grilled chicken out for anything else like salmon or shrimp even if I wanted to pay so I was told icicle only add it to the chicken salmon and chicken don't sound right in a salad to me! I also ordered the crab Mac and cheese which was very good. My hubby placed his order about 15 mins after I placed mine of half a Rosemary roasted chicken and a cold orzo pasta salad and his came out no kidding in about 5 min! We were like should he eat this!! He said It tasted as though it had been sitting under a heating lamp not hot thru, I didn't dare taste it it smelled great thou. My salad came out 10 min after his meal  and my chicken was luke warm. Everything looked very fresh on my salad but as thou it was pre prepped and refrigerated. For dessert we tried the key lime cheesecake which was a good size for two and pretty yummy!  This restaurant has a good price tag as far as entree prices and I will say for the class of people that filled the place I expected better service and much finer fresher quality of food. I would probably come back for apps and drinks but not to dine."}
{"text":"Time and time again, we have been to port city and have NEVER been disappointed. From the service, to the food, atmosphere, and overall experience, Port City has never let us down!  We live relatively close to this restaurant and also have a boat closely stored near this restaurant. When we take the boat out for a nice evening out, their docks are not only clean, but serviced by a staff person to help us tie up to the dock.  They have ample parking, and always make you feel welcome when you walk into the door. Their service is impeccable and definitely something starting restaurant business owners should take note of to ensure a successful business. I would definitely, without a doubt, encourage people to visit Port City.  Experience it yourself. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Even though we had a reservation, the hostesses had no clue where to seat us (in an EMPTY restaurant). I was told there was a 45 minute wait for the patio (even though it was empty! We left and decided to go to Rudder for better service and competent staff. Never going back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and water access was amazing but  everything else was subpar.  The waitstaff was unfamiliar with the preparation of a few menu items and didn't offer to check, instead she misstated and returned later to correct herself (delay one).  We waited 12 minutes flagged her down and ask for an update on the appetizers.  She said she wasn't sure, we request something something expedited and possibly bread.  She slaps her forehead and says she should have brought us some.  It goes down after that.   The manager explained that firing and sending out wings (appetizer) after 19 minutes wasn't really horribly long.  When we placed the order a sent a text to a business partner, referred to that time and it had be 27 minutes.  Every table seated around us had been served and most finishing up when we were still waiting.  Three of of those tables seated 15 minutes or more after us.    Half of the food arrived cold and none together.  Fiasco"}
{"text":"Port City Club is a great place to unwind. They have a nice view of the lake (though it's a bit crowded by all the docked boats) and a lovely beachside area where you can relax. As a Charlottean, the crowd is definitely older than what I'm used to, but it's kind of a nice change of pace. The decor is a bit outdated but it really does feel like a club.  The drinks aren't too pricey. I highly recommend getting there early, adding your name to the inevitably long list, and posting up on the couches outside while you wait for a table.   The food was decent. The four stars are definitely more for the location than the food. The zucchini chips are clearly one of their most popular items and they were delicious, albeit a bit salty. I then had the Greek salad which was sub-par. The feta came in a solid block (why?) and wasn't super high quality. As a vegetarian, they don't have a TON of options for me, but just enough."}
{"text":"Love this place.... it's the best restaurant on the lake, be patient and look for the white sign .... #cornelius it's a bit hidden off the street, but a great Spring - Summer hangout... they have  a beach where you can have a drink in the sand.  Port City Club, always consistent, you know what to expect.  Not too dressy, but you can if you want... I will always be a fan... Hello warm weather #lakenorman #portcityclub See you soon #portcityclub"}
{"text":"We've dined here twice and found the food, service and ambiance to be spot on. However, the ladies restroom needs to be monitored. When you pay money for a nice meal, you wouldn't expect to find that your stall is empty of toilet paper at 8:00 pm. If having to drip dry wasn't bad enough, the sink counter was flooded with soapy water and paper towels. To top it off, the trash can was overflowing onto the floor. Absolutely disgusting and turned the night sour for me. I said something to the hostess as we were leaving and it seemed to fall on deaf ears. I messaged the restaurant without response. I was outraged but maybe this is more common than I realize. Next time I eat out at a nice restaurant that we spend over $100 for, I'll start at the bathroom as I think that may describe the pride they take in everything else."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. The restaurant is beautiful with great water views. We went on a Saturday night recently and had to wait at the bar with a drink for quite a while to get an  outside table. The wait went fast and was worth it - the service was outstanding and the food was great. We are moving to the area and will definitely be back frequently."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant.  Right on the lake with docks so the boats can come in.  Three levels of seating including a lower level closest to the water with wicker couches and fire pits.  Live band for a few hours on Saturday night.  The ambiance is what I was looking for.  The food was ok.  I've had better ribeyes and oysters.  Would definitely go back though."}
{"text":"Hardest decision I've had to make on a review.... The food here is extremely good. I'd give it a 5 on food. Service I'd give a 4. Our party of 6 were served 4 entrees and 4 minutes later the other 2 members of our party received theirs. I ordered a steak with potatoes and mixed vegetables. Perfect all around minus..... Halfway through my plate here comes our server with a steak knife. I probably had 3 bites of steak left. I think if you realize you didn't bring it to me initially and I haven't asked for one by this point you're only making it worse bringing our a steak knife at this point.  What really knocks my star level down on this place is the customer service, reservations, and attitude. We called on Wednesday mid afternoon for a reservation for Friday night. We asked for 6pm and they said all they had was 530 or 8; we took the 530. The girl on the phone acted as if it was the hardest job in the world to get us in at that time. After our meal this evening the restaurant wasn't even half full. We left after 7, where were all the people to keep us from a 6pm reservation? Food YUM rest up for debate."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night and so glad we did...atmosphere was awesome, we sat outside and it felt like we were on vacation.  Food was great, not as expensive as food of that quality might be elsewhere.  Had read a lot of reviews that complained about the service but our waitress was super friendly, attentive and knowledgeable of the menu.  Can't wait to go in the fall when it's not so hot out!"}
{"text":"Food was great along with the service. I had salad with salmon added and it was wonderful. Hubby had flatbread and he lived it as well."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Friday afternoon. The food was great and the atmosphere is beautiful on the lake!"}
{"text":"The view is the only reason we come. I bring family here, but only b/c of the view. We typically sit at the bar and order apps. The bartenders are ridiculously slow and unmotivated. I spent over $100 at bar tonight and the bartenders had no clue. This is consistent at the bar. So wish they had people that cared."}
{"text":"So...I really like this place!! Not sure why it's only got 3.5 stars. It's the old Midtown Sundries- They've remodeled the inside and now it's really cute and contemporary. I've eaten their salmon Caesar salad which was really good, their wings (which were ok), the Cuban (which was delicious and I'm a Cuban sandwich connoisseur- I know a good Cuban sandwich and they got it right). I also tried the cheesy shrimp bread and my only qualm was that it was just too cheesy for my liking. All good, there's plenty of other things on the menu for me to try. I do wish I lived closer so I could come more often, but when I felt like making the drive out there, I was never disappointed. We've never had issues with wait times, but maybe we've been lucky. It's also nice walking around the boardwalk after dinner when the weather allows. Give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on a Tuesday night. I was impressed with the setup and location. We sat outside on the patio, which is covered on top, but opens up to the lake view. There are also lounge chairs and fire pits out on the sand. It definitely has a great hang out spot vibe to it. The inside has a beautiful bar, which I'd love to sit at next time. It seems like a great venue for work/company events as well and is very spacious on the inside.   I wasn't overly impressed with the food this time around. I got the bison burger with swiss cheese. Sadly, there wasn't anything to write home about with this burger. I'm a burger girl and always looking for something unique and different for my taste buds. The bun was boring and bland, and the bison meat wasn't cooked to medium. Our waiter, though, was very attentive and very friendly. The service was great. The wine list is pretty decent, and I love that they offer local beers.  I'd definitely come back and try something else on the menu next time!"}
{"text":"Great food/atmosphere. Don't expect attentive or timely service. 70% of my visits have witnessed servers who only check on their tables once every 30 minutes or so. Perhaps it's a staffing issue."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I went here a few months ago with my family- we were hosting visitors and wanted to show them the lake. We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful view and the restaurant's classy yet laid back atmosphere.  The menu was perfect; great variety with something to please everyone.  We were very happy with the service as well. Our server was a guy named Johnny. He was great with and helped with recommendations.  Port City is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I have to say, the fish tacos and the atmosphere are the best things about Port City.  Service and other dishes are mediocre at best.  This was my third visit and the service is always so so.  A little disappointing."}
{"text":"Food is probably closer to a 3 but the service and ambience brings the overall rating up. We had the rockefeller oysters which were good. I also got a rather unmemorable entree.... In general, it was a bit overpriced but if you're looking for a place with good service and an excellent view (also has an outdoor patio which is awesome to watch the sunset over the lake) the price is worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome decor and the view of the lake from the patio areas cannot be beaten. Good service, a non-snarky atmosphere even though the ambiance appears upscale. Great good presentation and they sure do know how to cook a good steak!  *Update* I gave this place 5 stars a while back and now I wish I could give it more as it's gotten even better with time. Service is consistently great and I have never had a bad dish.  The salmon is out of this world. The bison burger is the best burger in this area. Don't even get me started on the orzo. Love, Love, lovvvvve this place!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Really good food.  When you get a seat the servers are really good for the most part.  Biggest complaint is that we made a reservation 2 weeks in advance that didn't seem to matter at all.   We waited 45 minutes for our table then another 45 minutes before our food arrived.   Total management issue not the servers."}
{"text":"Never had something like this happen. We arrived close to closing and tried to get food or even a drink and we were turned away. We all returned to boat and as we did another boat arrived I told him they were closed as I helped him tie up. He said \"Not for me, I will have them turn on the lights, where is Heather\". I said good luck. I waited at dock to tell him \"I told you so\", but he didn't return?? I went in to see him and his date sitting at bar with a cocktail and beer!! So I asked again and was harshly told we are not open.. So quick tip if you go there you better know Heather. I will never return and will not recommend this place to anyone. I will make it my goal to take customers from their seats."}
{"text":"We went for drinks this past Saturday and the service was beyond terrible!! We arrived about 9:00 pm and there was only about 10 people in the entire place. We were excited to relax in a beautiful restaurant, however waiting over 10 min for a drink was not acceptable. All the bartenders and staff were at the end of the bar eating, and talking to each other. There were several others whom complained about the service. I won't be back for drinks or food!KellyO"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at the Port City Club! The place is huge, but we made a reservation so we could try and sit outside. They aren't on Open Table so you will need to call to make a reservation, but we got right in. You can't reserve the outside patio, but they give preference to those that make a reservation. I would definitely recommend sitting outside. The restaurant is right on Lake Norman so it offers a great view while eating some amazing food.   Our waitress was top-notch. She made us laugh from the beginning and didn't make us wait to order any of our food or beverages.   Now onto the food. We ordered two appetizers, the oysters and the lump crab. The oysters were Blue Point and were wonderful. I would definitely recommend getting those if you are an oyster fan. The lump crab was not as good. It came with this mayo sauce that was too overpowering for the crab. They also didn't serve the crab with any chips so it was a bit awkward to eat on its own.   The main courses were very good. My boyfriend had the special fish of the day which was the Snapper. It was very tasty. I had the Mahi Mahi which was good, but not as good as the Snapper.   As for sides, we had the Lobster Mac and Cheese. Oh my goodness. This was amazing. It is absolutely worth the $7 up-charge.   We were especially hungry that night and decided to splurge on dessert, so we got a cheesecake with some kind of Snickers topping. If you are in the mood for dessert, this is a great choice. I'm a bit biased though because I'm a huge chocolate person.   Overall, I was very happy with my restaurant experience and would be back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful open floor plan; had lunch outside.  Nice breeze from the water.  Didn't eat inside, but a friend with kids tells me it's really noisy inside for dinner (so she feels OK taking her toddlers there).  Started with Oysters Rockefeller.  Presentation was lovely, but sauce was heavy on the sherry and spice.  Fish tacos were delicious; plenty of fresh mahi mahi; I added lemon juice to it.  Fries crispy.  Tried my friend's flat bread.  It looked good.  Service was excellent, and timed well for a \"ladies' lunch\".  I will definitely go again, if it's good weather to sit outside."}
{"text":"My virgin experience at Port City took place just last night, by way of a friend's birthday dinner and I have to say I was more than satisfied with everything Port City has to offer.  Here's the breakdown from the Port to the City...  Parking:  There's plenty of parking in the private, and somewhat hidden lot Port City is located in.  Def use your gps! Either way, parking shouldn't be to much of an issue - I went at 6:30 on a Saturday night and didn't have any issues.    Set-up/Ambiance:  The set-up of this place is truly something to take-in if you've never been before.  Of course there's the prerequisite booths and tables, but there's also a huge bar, with plenty of comfy seats.  There's also plenty of HD-screens littering the bar area.  Past the bar is a covered patio area with a second bar (no screens at second bar) and additional tables overlooking the lake.  KEEEEP going though and there's another UN-covered patio area, with more tables and more views.  The place is huge and takes advantage of its location on the lake with its breathtaking views and never-ending patio.  Food/Drink:  Food is awesome!  As I was there for a birthday, several appetizers were ordered and they were all fantastic.  The calamari was fried to perfection, and the classic marinara sauce it was served with was on-point.  The humus dip was set-off by the smoked/grilled soft pita bread it was served with.  The guacamole the (small) crab cakes was a new twist on two of my favorites that I absolutely loved.   My entree, the salmon, was flakey and tasty!   I enjoyed the long, thick asparagus and mashed potatoes I ordered as my sides (a la carte).  Drinkwise - I mean they've got a full bar, plenty of local drafts and craft beers - shouldn't have any issues.  Service:  Service was awesome.  Although our server wasn't super personable, he was efficient, timely, knowledgeable and got the jump done without any issues or concerns.  Looking for a nice Lake spot, with stunning views, fantastic food and exceptional service??  Port City checks all the boxes.  My first time at Port City was so memorable, I can't wait to do it again!"}
{"text":"Dinner with Apps.  Shrimp Cocktail  Crab cakes  Scallops  Ginger drizzle over salmon  All were fresh and timely.  Wait staff was friendly and attentive. Knowledge base of the menu could have been improved.  Tellings is that \"they order it a lot\" is not the recommendation we were hoping for   Nice view of the lake especially with the thunderstorm rolling through. We will be back."}
{"text":"We had dinner outside tonight at Port City Club with a party of 6.  The views and service provided by our server Ally were amazing.  We will be back to this hidden gem without a doubt.  They were quite busy which was probably the cause of our beverages taking about 10 minutes.  All of the appetizers and entrees were exceptional."}
{"text":"Y'ALL. FIVE DOLLAR MIMOSAS - I needn't say more... but I will.  Came here with my mom for Sunday lunch without even THINKING about Sunday brunch and ordered some mimosas just because we can.. and they were FIVE DOLLARS. Are they made with fresh-squeezed OJ? Probably not. Fancy bubbly? Nope. But still, they were crisp and refreshing and mimosas and yummy and five freaking dollars.  Caprese sandwich is to die for. Crab cakes (appetizer) are tiny but definitely delicious. Next time we'll have to actually order something more brunch-y and definitely dine here at dinner time when they're serving their full menu.   Love the lake access and the outdoor seating. Super bummed that they tore down the volleyball net that used to be there back when this place was whatever it was, but fiiiine I see why you did it. :)"}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent. We sat on the patio but had to walk thru the dining room which smelled of cleaning products."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant 3 times and I AM DONE....... The food was sub-par (not as described on 1 entree and 2 others at our table were not what was ordered!) and the service was worse.  Waited more than an hour for an appetizer. Will never go again.  There are other BETTER options in the area."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place does not have higher ratings.  Going through town we had a party of 36 and they handled us quickly with ease and courtesy.   The food was great, there is a lot of variety of the menu.   Out table had crab toast and Calamari Fritte to start with.  Both were fresh and tasty.  Dinner was Tuna steak, eggplant Parm, Filet and all were great dishes that we would order again.    The Eggplant Parm had 3 large pieces, with a crunchy texture and tomato sauce.  The eggplant was on top of a decent size bed if linguine that was well flavored and fresh."}
{"text":"This place could be great!!!!  Some staff need to be replaced and the rest just need some direction. It's like there is no management on staff so it's a cluster F fri through sun.   When the food is good it is truly good but then there are times when they forget to bring your apps out and everything  is cold. I guess I could sum it up that  fri - sun is 1 star and weekdays are 5 star.   It bugs me that every time I go on Friday or sat night they have a wait and at least 1/2 the tables are empty. The hostesses are especially terrible and I think every time I can't believe they are still here and haven't been fired by now. I can't imagine turning people away and not even suggesting the bar or the outside sand seating for an app and drinks."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? I want to like it so much. I used to like it so much...good food, friendly staff, and a great view.  I've been here a handful of times, various times of day, and it's just gotten so bad.  The bartenders are rushing around like they have a bar that's ten deep, no personalities, giving you no reason to leave even a decent tip (I used to bartend..I know what it takes). The same bartender has been there the last three times. The first time she carded me she told me I wasn't old enough to drink. I'm 29.  Tonight another bartender didn't know how to pour a Guinness properly.  Really?  Onto the food... A medium well burger with fries and a salad with blackened chicken. The restaurant was moderately busy, but in no way, shape or form should it have taken 40 minutes for our food to arrive. On my salad: the chicken...not blackened, not even lukewarm and they must be rationing out the feta. The burger...kinda a little bit warm, thank god the fries were scalding hot! The fry cook should obviously be fired since he can't keep up on simple French fry orders.  I had to wait another 10 minutes for a bartender to come over to get salt and pepper...these are the basics! The only people who didn't suck were the hostesses. Won't be going back there for a while, or ever..."}
{"text":"This place deserves a great review. The are very accommodating to all types and sizes of parties. The location has amazing waterfront views, sandy beach lounge, covered and uncovered deck and great interior atmosphere.   The bar selection is great and not overpriced like you'd expect. The menu is diverse with great options from seafood and steak specials to burgers, flatbreads and sandwiches. The bison burger is delicious.  Great appetizer selection as well. The great part about it is it is truly everyone's meeting place so you can come off the boat casually or dressed to the nines after a formal event. Groups can usually take a little longer on service but that's expected when some order specialty dishes and others order a sandwich. Try the trio dips while you're waiting."}
{"text":"Cold and sterile, hostess argued over who should seat us, then we weren't greeted by a server, moved to the bar. Felt ignored. Went outside to sit and the outside bar was closed (at 9) and it smelled like dirty mop water outside.   Ordered a bourbon and left."}
{"text":"We come down to Lake Norman with a big group every 4th of July, and we've had meals here at least 4 times now. Each time it's just OK, and each time we run into the same issues. Not enough to ruin our experience (or keep us from coming back, obviously), but Port City definitely banks on it's location and fails to strive for excellence in other departments as they know people will keep returning for the views and proximity alone.   The service is often sub-par. This year, we came in on a weekend evening with a group of 8. In PCC's defense, we did not have a reservation, but we waited for an hour for a table and literally half of the restaurant was completely empty. I have worked in hospitality for many years and realize this is a resource issue / lack of wait staff, etc, but on a holiday weekend they should be prepared for these kinds of crowds. Our waiter this time had a very limited knowledge of the menu, and even though everything came out correctly and on time, it took a lot of repeating / pointing to menu items to get our order in.   The food is good. Some items are above average, some are below, but nothing here is going to blow your mind. Just typical tavern food. I have found that the fish is fresh and the seafood dishes are typically better than the others, but I haven't been super impressed by anything else.   The atmosphere is great, the patio is beautiful, and the location can't be beat. The rest fails to live up to this aspect. With some new restaurants opening up on the water nearby, PCC is going to have to step up it's game to stay in business."}
{"text":"Love this place! We've been here for brunch and lunch several times and each time it's a crowd pleaser. The food and drinks are delicious and the service is great. It also sits right on the lake so the view is beautiful. Highly recommended. Hoping to try it out for dinner soon."}
{"text":"To sum it up: I wouldn't have changed a thing about it! AMAZING atmosphere- i.e. Right on the lake with tons of outdoor seating and a beach with additional seating to have drinks while you wait for your table! And believe me, there is usually an hour wait on a Friday Saturday night, so don't come too hungry ! Prices were extremely reasonable and the food quality was pretty great!! I got chicken carbonara - they were very flexible and accommodating with their menu as far as changing things, and everyone else loved what they got. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wish I had better things to say. We waited 1.5 hours for our food! I think there was a mess up in the kitchen as the people that sat down way after we had, ate dinner and were leaving just as we got our food. Our waitress was really nice and brought an appetizer out, on the house because we had 2 toddlers that were starving and it was getting late. Mean while my 2 year old drank all of her Orange juice during our 2 plus hour dinner, and I ordered a second one. Our friends ordered Grouper and it came out 7-10 minutes after we all got our food.  My lobster and shrimp sandwich was so so.  When it came time for my bill, I was charged $6.50 for my 2 year olds OJ. Guess there isn't free refills on that.  However I feel like as long as we waited I should have only been charged for one. Maybe better luck next time, but my first trip here was too impressive."}
{"text":"Great food, environment, service & prices! Went in for a late night dinner with a few friends, we had a great time. Everyone was satisfied. Baked Brie & lobster truffle mac & cheese was amazing! Coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and beautiful lake scenery. You can go for parties or go right off the lake. Nice atmosphere to hangout and socialize."}
{"text":"It was good food... but for the price I felt it lacked that \"extra\" something...  Staff is very nice.  I just felt there are some better places on the lake."}
{"text":"This is my husband's and I's go-to spot as far as views, location and overall food and service quality when dining on Lake Norman. Service has always been friendly and we are usually seated right away when we do not make a reservation. We've eaten here for brunch, lunch and dinner. Their menu is extensive and won't break the bank. Plenty to offer if you're a pescatarian, vegetarian, or carnivore :) Can't beat the views of Lake Norman. They have optional seating in the deck area and 'beach'. Good place to bring guests from out of town or just to unwind your work week and/or day. Just a heads up, everytime I've ordered their mahi-based fish entrees, it's come out dry."}
{"text":"Was looking to try somewhere different and ran across this place. It is definitely hidden back behind a neighborhood off the main road. The place itself is huge with a big bar area, many tables for Lounging, and a covered patio/porch area. Was decorated very nice for Christmas. Very good atmosphere. Service was pretty good as the place was empty due to 8pm on a rainy Monday night. Ordered the porkchop which was cooked to perfection. Very juicy and flavorful. My other half had the ceviche, which he thoroughly enjoyed. Also had a very nice variety of beer and wine. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This recently opened restaurant took over what used to be Midtown Sundries on the lake. The location has been transformed into a beautiful dining spot. I went to eat with a friend. We each had a glass of wine. Wine by the glass ranges in price from $9-$12. The waitress was very helpful in choosing a good glass. We each also had a house salad composed of mixed greens, cherry tomatos, red onion and croutons. The dressings are house made and very good. I had the Tuscan Chicken which was perfectly cooked and quite delicious. The accompanying roasted potatoes where perfect. My friend had the Stuffed Salmon. She enjoyed it, however the crab stuffing contained too much breading for both of our taste. Her dish came with seasonal vegetables and mashed potatoes all of which were good. I would definitely eat here again. The location is large, so there is plenty of room to accommodate a large party. The staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I come from a family that are major food critics, if the food didn't turn out so well they make a big stink about it. I don't like doing that, I just suck it up and then not go back ever again. But this place, I have something AMAZING to say about it. The location, the food, the service, was absolutely fantastic. I've never had ceviche before, and let me tell you, it was so good! Scallops, shrimp and calamari with a lemon -vinegarette ad EVOO. My dad has been searching for a place that has good ceviche and I called him up right away and told him I found the place. Also on Sundays there are $5 Mimosas, delish. For the main meal, I ordered salmon and my friend ordered mahi. We ate our food in less than 5 minutes it was that good. The salmon just melted in my mouth. It does take a little longer than usual to get your food, but it's FRESHLY MADE TO ORDER, so trust me, if you can have the patience, you won't be disappointed in the end, it's worth the wait. Amy was our server and she was very sweet. Then we had the Lobster truffle mac and cheese as our side to share. I am a Mac and Cheese fanatic so when I tasted this, it was like heaven. It's creamy and those chunks of lobster in it, very delicious. We did not order any dessert since we were so full, but we did see the dessert being served to other tables and the portion sizes are huge! Next time I come here I will order dessert. I have nothing bad to say about this place. The location being on the marina, the wicker patio sets outside with the sand underneath your feet, the decor made me feel like I was in South Florida. This will be a place I keep coming back to that's for sure. Thank you for my amazing first experience! :)"}
{"text":"1 star for the view 1 star for the Heineken There is no way they can serve this huge menu fresh and well prepared.  I ordered a flatbread and got a pizza. The pizza dough was way to thick to be considered flatbread. The old saying less is more. This might be a very personal opinion, but there was way too much topping for a flatbread.  What appears to be a somewhat of a \"fancier\" restaurant, isn't. People were walking around in swim suits and tank tops.  Our server was very pleasant and on top of thing. He even offered me a glass with my beer. Later after waiting about 40 minutes for our food, advised us the kitchen was finally catching up."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch the day after my Florida vacation, couldn't get enough of the water I suppose.  We ate on the outside deck.  The server was nice enough, I ordered the Cuban and the Rosemary potato wedges, which aren't available until nighttime, so I readjusted and ordered potato salad.  While I waited for the food to be served, I walked along side the dock.  The outside area was absolutely disgusting.  Not only were there cigarette butts, literally everywhere!  It looked like a frat party had happened in the outer area.  There were beer cans, bottles, several wine glasses on tables, in the grass, even down on the beach area where boaters park to come into the establishment.  This was on a Wednesday afternoon mind you.  Plenty of time to clean after the weekend shenanigans.  Not only was the place full of trash, but the landscaping looks like nothing had been done including just a simple taking of the leaves and trash around the bushes and in the mulch.   All along thinking to myself that I can't believe this place is charging what they do.  It's definitely not for the cleanliness.  The Cuban was ok, more worth like 1/2 the price on the menu, the potato salad was not tasty at all.  One bite and done.  Even the side came out ALL carbonation.  I am not impressed at all and will not return nor suggest this overpriced unclean place to anyone I know."}
{"text":"We sailed our boat to Port City Club and docked along side their pretty Boardwalk, in 6' of water. We chose outside seating, waiting just a few minutes. Flatbread pizzas were huge and a very fun selection of flavors. Our server Danielle was experienced, she knew the menu, made helpful recommendations and even knew that the boat fuel and pump-out services were only available on weekends. Very reasonable priced, we will definitely return, soon!"}
{"text":"Much better than the last time.  Been awhile since we were here but time to revisit  Today was much better than the last time which left everyone feeling good but wanting more.  Today was just my wife and myself.  I had the Oyster Po Boy and it was much improved although the sauce on the sandwich is still somewhat lame.  Asked for Cocktail Sauce which proved to be a great accent.  My wife had a Salad garnished with Crab cake along with a side of fruit which she enjoyed.    Crab Cake was a perfect protein accent to the salad.  Decor has improved and is lighter and cleaner than before. Good improvement over Midtown Sundries or Latitude but still and upscale Sports Bar."}
{"text":"Today was my 15th check in here and unfortunately, I think it will be my last.  I've been coming here since January and have seen a decline in the menu.  The service has never been great, but has become terrible.  Consistency is a problem and the management is beyond lacking.  I had such high hopes for this place because of the location, view and the overhaul of the once Midtown Sundries.  The food here is pretty good - its the service and management that has made me not wanting to return.  For example, today, we sat in the covered patio area - the windows were filthy, there are holes in the floor that are covered by what are supposed to be decorative grates, but are barely in place, bent and sticking up and saw two people trip and almost fall.  The tables are always wobbly and had to spend the entire time taking turns with your foot placed on one of the legs so we could cut our food and not spill our drinks because it moved so much.  Yes, these things are minor, easily fixed - but has consistently been a problem and takes away from the dining experience.    I have seen the last three times I have been there tables return their food and not once did management come out to talk to them.  The last visit where I sat outside, an umbrella fell and the pointed end almost hit a lady in her eye and again, no manager in sight to come out, make sure she was ok or apologize.  Again, things that can easily be fixed.  Back to the food being sent back - we sat there and watched as the server dumped it in the trash.  Having a trash can in the dining area in plain view is not smart.  It's unappealing and definitely does not leave a good impression when you see four plates of food being thrown away for all to see. Several tables were watching and commenting.  Service - slow and never consistent.  Today, we noticed every table had bread before their meal.  Not once were we offered - not a huge deal, but just another example of where this restaurant is lacking consistency and good service.  I think out of the 15 times I have been there, we have been offered bread three times.  I like a place that is consistent in their service.  When it came time for the check, I went ahead and asked for it while our server was removing our plates and gave them my card - we sat there wondering if they got lost - almost 10 min to get my card and receipt back to sign. I just am tired of the lack of service we get when we go there.  It is the slowness and waiting for drinks, checks, etc. over and over that are a consistent problem.  There have been two servers in the past that were fantastic, but I have not seen them there lately.    Food - the flat breads are great, so are the salads and the sandwiches are good (at least the ones I have had.  The sides, not so much.  The only side during lunch that is worth ordering are the fries - very good.  Skip the orzo pasta and potato salad - I would rather go without a side.  The old menu had items that should not have been removed. The vegetable focaccia and even the steamed veggies on the side were really good on the old menu.  I would often order an extra sandwich to go just because it was that good - but it is no longer available.  I really do miss some of the dishes that were on the previous menu.  I visited for dinner a few weeks ago and noticed that the shrimp and scallops have been trimmed down - you don't get the same number as you used to, but the price is still the same.  It's still a great dish, but a little disappointed when it came out and noticed that it wasn't what it used to be.  The asparagus with béarnaise side dish on the dinner menu is one I would definitely order again.   I tried the roasted chicken and mashed potatoes - wouldn't get it again.  The mashed potatoes tasted like they were out of a box and the chicken was just ok.  Probably the only meal I have had there were I was disappointed in the food itself.  Everything else has been good and in some cases great like the lobster mac and cheese (if you are ok with paying $7 extra for a side).  I just hate not wanting to go back because I have been here over and over hoping they would get it right.  It is just a huge disappointment and I think I am taking a long break and hope they start getting it right because there is so much potential.  A lot of which is training the servers better and the management needs to seriously step it up.  I am just frustrated by the service and if I am going to pay good money for food and drinks, I want good service and don't mind tipping 20% and up when the dining experience calls for it which hasn't happened here.  The view and atmosphere are great and a lot of the food is really good, I am just tired of some of the other issues that can be addressed and fixed - I just think they would have been by now."}
{"text":"The food is just ok for the prices.  Seems to be more focused on presentation than serving size and flavor. Great view of the lake and upscale dining."}
{"text":"Love this place! The ambience is lovely with a ton of outdoor seating. We had brunch - they have a brunch menu on weekends that is excellent! Bloody Mary at $5 was spicy and perfect. Their seafood is flown in daily and is amazing- the ceviche is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Have been here three times and have been pleased every time. Food is good and specials are fresh and delicious. Service was slow once but they were busy. Can be out of select beers at times too. Overall a great meal and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on the lake with my wife, her sisters, and her mother on a warm Sunday evening in mid-October.  We were seated immediately on the patio, and we quickly obtained a table.  That was the last \"quick\" part about the meal.  Service was slow for drinks, orders, food, and bill.  It was okay as we enjoyed the waterfront dining, but it got to be a little tiresome as the evening progressed.    The appetizer was the \"PCC Trio\", which included a pimento cheese that I simply haven't adjusted to yet.  The pico was flavorful, and I really enjoyed the pita chips.  The beer I had hoped for was not available (Wicked Weed Coolcumber, which I had there in June and it was awesome in 100 degree heat), but that happens and I'm not docking my review for that.  However, I will fault the place for how long it took to get a beer.  I'd say the inside was at about 40% full, and the patio seating was almost full, but the place just didn't seem busy enough to justify the delays.  Our server was friendly, and we liked her, we just wish maybe we'd have seen a little more of her.    For dinner I had the Pacific Cod sandwich, fired in a tempura batter and served with fries.  I ordered a caesar salad as well, which I would have thought would be served with the appetizer course, but it wasn't.  The timing of the meal was just off with the appetizers and mains.  The fish was enormous, and it was good, but not great.   Everyone seemed to like the food, but the delays in all aspects of the service put a serious damper on the evening. We'll try it again if only for the amazing view (and my favorite thing - dining under palm trees!), but I'm going to be hoping for an improvement on the service side.  Finally, I feel like maybe this place isn't sure what it wants to be.  The decor inside is attempting to be upscale, as it some of the menu, but yet it caters to people coming in off their boats docked outside dressed for lake activities.  I think there's nothing wrong with it, but the formal atmosphere inside clashes with the clientele.    As I said, I will go again, but I hope that the next time is better."}
{"text":"1 star for service 3.5 for food  Yeah it really sucks how that service score brings ya down now doesn't it?  The food was nothing special.  I'll say this, It was affordable.  I expected to pay a lot more.  I got salmon with asparagus and I added an extra side of lobster mac and cheese. It wasn't bad, but wasn't special. I think it says a lot that one of my dining companions said that the salmon she got at the Hilton hotel was better.  Yeah.  I will say this, the salmon was cooked perfectly, the sauce was just lacking.  The mac and cheese - just meh.  The service was TERRIBLE.  Our waiter had the personality of a wet dishrag.  Our food came promptly, but the wheels fell off the buss when  he sat the dishes down to the wrong spots.  When he realized the mistake (as we were trading plates among each other) we just got a shrug of the shoulders.  No Oh I'm sorry.  In fact he appeared pissed off that we deigned to expect to get what we ordered.  Novel concept right?  He also then pulled a disappearing act.  Didn't get refills on water, he just was struggling with basics of being a server.  It's one thing to be incapable and trying, but with a good attitude...it's a whole other ball of wax to suck at your job and do it with a craptastic attitude.  For this I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal with great friends! Filet was perfect asparagus and broccoli Perfect ! Best meal I've had in a long time ! Great place for date or a night out with friends. Service was wonderful too. We sat on the closed in patio overlooking lake"}
{"text":"2 stars is based on service which was great. Not the fastest but still prompt and our server was nice.    My low ranking pertains to the food. To be as PG as possible the food was terrible.   We ordered the Charcuterie Board and the meats were the most processed meats i have seen on a board i have ordered. They ended up making my stomach hurt later that evening pretty bad. The cheese was alright but all in all for the type of restaurant this place claims to be their food his low quality.  Order a flat bread later and the pork was not fully cooked on it making it taste really weird. Also ordered a Mimosa and im sure the glass was not clear because it did not smell just like champagne and orange juice.   Would not recommend ever. This place tried to have a certain facade or high class but the food is very low quality and clearly whoever runs the restaurant is cheap. They have mostly you workers which equals low pay but still don't see to spend that on better quality food."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Lunch is a little weak but after 4 pm dinner is served.  Try the lobster mac and cheese"}
{"text":"Love Port City Club. Excellent Filet steak, friendly service, great views. My wife and I have been five times now without any disappointments."}
{"text":"I like the outdoor patio. If you know what to order food is good. I have had the lobster and shrimp roll which is consistently good. My husband has had the rack of lamb and grouper which was also good. We have had the crab toast which was good and the Rockefeller oysters which were ok. I haven't had luck with the crab cake on a salad which was insufficient from a portion perspective and misrepresented despite their claims.   Cocktails are great. Service is not great. It's good if there are no problems but if there are customer issues, it falls apart completely and is very defensive. Tonight I had a warm glass of white wine in a cold glass. When I asked for a colder pour, they returned my wine with shaved ice in it!  When I mentioned the ice, the waitress and whom I think was the manager got very defensive and didn't understand what the problem was.  It was obvious the bottle was chilled only after I ordered it or it was poured and sat out and got warm.  They said they put all their white wine on ice vs a wine fridge or refrigerator. The manager didn't seem to believe me and then brought the bottle out much later and poured it in front of me. It was definitely a little colder but I am really put off by their attitude and trustworthiness. It made for a poor customer experience."}
{"text":"Good food ,great staff beautiful view , but needs cleaning of cigarette waste outside!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Had dinner there recently. One of our group wanted a Cuban sandwich and asked to hold the mustard. Waitress informed him that wasn't possible because the sandwiches come in pre-made and then are warmed prior to serving. WHAT? Another in our group ordered eggplant parmesan, however she got chicken parmesan, which isn't even on the menu. WHAT? Makes me wonder if their entrees are bought frozen and \"cooked\" on premises. Should not happen in a high end establishment."}
{"text":"Lobster and crap roll. French fries. Food is good. Water front. Cool atmosphere. Service is good. I will be back"}
{"text":"An enjoyable place to meet with friends and family for a great experience, from their outdoor seating to the great service. Port city is a place to stop by and see."}
{"text":"The setting is perfect, we enjoyed the patio overlooking the water, under the stars, but the food is mediocre at most, the presentation is horrible and portions are huge and tasteless,  Chef, you gotta do better...."}
{"text":"Wow! What a HUGE disappointment. I'm not sure who owns/manages this place but they could use some basic training. This place occupies a beautiful spot on Lake Norman and they have a nice covered patio with a gorgeous lake view. We were trying this place for the first time and were looking forward to sitting outside. Common sense would dictate that there would be heaters out there so that even in November, people could dine outside. Talk about a missed opportunity. Ok, so we couldn't sit out on the patio; too cold and who wants to eat dinner bundled up in winter coats. The lake view is totally being wasted here. Next, we were greeted by a nice but totally inexperienced server. I'd read something about white sangria there being great, which I asked her about and I got a blank stare and she said, oh yah I think we do have that but I'm not sure what it's called.\" Huh? Ok so no white sangria? We ordered the baked brie appetizer, which was good but was served with crackers that undoubtedly came from a box. This is supposed to be a nice restaurant. I ordered a wedge salad that was served with hardly any dressing. We had to ask for silverware twice, we had to ask for salt and pepper. It was my husband's birthday, which I mentioned when we came in (hoping for a nice table). I asked about the desserts and our server told us about three different things. I'd read about the coconut cake, which is my husband's favorite, and when the server did not mention it, I said, oh, no coconut cake? She said, oh yah, and coconut cake. My hubs and I smiled at each other and said to her, \"great, that's our favorite.\" So, after we finished dinner, the server came over and said, \"I hear that it's someone's. Birthday\" and she sat a piece of some kind of chocolate cake thing in front of my husband. This would have been appreciated (even though we wanted to try the coconut cake, as we had indicated a few minutes earlier), but the  cake was hard, and tasted like it had been sitting in the refrigerator too long. The whole experience was odd. Zero attention to detail. We wont be back and I wont recommend this place to anyone and it's unfortunate because there is so much potential there. PS: bathroom was filthy"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere by the lake but the food is just okay. The cocktails are also very weak. Been here 3 times and ordered different things and food is always cold. Service is also just okay."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better then a waterfront restaurant. This place is really nice. We came here for lunch and there's plenty of seating. This place is huge lol. The service was good. We sat on the patio facing the water which was peaceful and nice! Our waiter had no issues propping up our umbrella in the perfect position to block the sun away from us.   Our food was also really good. I had the crab cake sandwich which that hit the spot too! Soo good.   Can't wait to come back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Ahh this place is so bougie! There's literally a lake right behind this restaurant which makes it so lovely! I got a lot of \"date night\" vibes from this place. Inside has a pretty formal atmosphere. I ordered the fish and mash potatoes. The dish was pretty good. I enjoyed my moms dish more though! She ordered the lobster roll- soo bomb. The service was okay as well. Love PCC! Next time, we'll definitely dine outside on the patio!"}
{"text":"Apparently their policy is to always comp food in this type of situation. Our server just forgot to do it when she totaled us out. They were kind enough to send a $30 comp card for their mistake."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends.  We had 10 people, so service wasn't super fast, but considering there were 2 parties our size the service was really good.  We had the calamari, meatballs and oysters for apps.  I'm no oyster fan personally, but the other 2 were great and the oysters disappeared so I guess that means they are pretty good too! For dinner, I had the filet and it was done pretty well.  I've had better and I've had worse at similar restaurants."}
{"text":"I was there recently with a group of friends.  I had never been to the previous restaurants in the location.   I ordered the CreoleJambalaya at $16, with added \"jumbo\" blackened shrimp for $6 extra.  My friends ordered baked trout, stuffed salmon, steak.  Their dishes all arrived, very nice portions and platings.  My jambalaya arrived, a bowl of tomato sauce surrounding about 1/3 cup of rice.  The chicken and andouille sausage were barely to be found, and the jumbo shrimp were nicely seasoned, but jumbo, they were not.  I certainly expected something different. This was not a $22 dish.  But everyone else had extra food to take home and were pleased.  Service was great, and the restaurant, though large, is divided into various spaces and is quite lovely."}
{"text":"The food is good and the location is wonderful.  It is the nicest atmosphere for lakefront dining in this area. Its a good place to start your evening and have a nice dinner. Don't expect to have a night out here. They close early and instead of letting you know they're closing, they ignore you, even while sitting at the bar. We all know service is just as important as the quality of the food. Go for the food and location, don't expect white glove service."}
{"text":"We ate here for Mother's Day today.  Pros:  *service was very friendly *fish tacos were delicious *prices reasonable for the most part *atmosphere was nice outside by the water  Cons: *2 hour wait with no options for reservations *umbrellas outside would be a great addition"}
{"text":"I love the food. The mussels are my favorite. I get them every time and they are always consistently fabulous! The atmosphere is also great to hang out with friends. You can grab a drink at the bar or relax outside on a nice evening on their outside patio. Their fish specials are delicious!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Port City for lunch over the weekend.  Primarily because it was on the water and it was a beautiful day.    This used to be midtown sundries and the food was something to be desired.   Port City is much better.   I had Cuban and my wife had the Lobster roll.  Both were good and would be back to try more of the dishes."}
{"text":"Great location! Beautiful Lakefront view. Customer service was also excellent. Large menu with a large selection. I ordered the crab toast to start and the wild mushroom flatbread. Highly recommend both! I'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"My buddies and I SUPd to this spot that became my new favorite restaurant on the water: great food, drinks and ambiance! Bartender Neal makes an awesome ruby red TX vodka/ St Germain/ jalapeño thing on the rockS!"}
{"text":"Great view.  Good service. Appetizers very good.  Diver scallops. A bit old tasting the risotto was glue. The longer it sat the firmer it became. At the end it like a large softball that I Was glad wasn't inside my tummy   Great View!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great meal at Port City yesterday. Despite it looking just short of upscale, as it is waterfront location, any casual dress is fine. Service and food was great. For an app we shared calamari; good, not great, I prefer it crispier. My friend was disappointed that the pork chop she wanted -- she was really hungry -- was not available until 4 pm, neither were the other entrees she would have liked. However, she ordered a burger and fries and loved it. I ordered mussels cooked in wine, garlic, and a lobster broth. The mussels were small (I know the secret to getting them to plump up), but they were still very good and tender. Served with the lobster broth was good, different, and I asked for a spoon to have some as soup. Waiters were great: friendly and efficient. Taking family there soon."}
{"text":"First the pros, sitting out on the deck as a great experience in terms of the view, the food has never disappointed me and for that reason I attempt to return, however the owner should be embarrass by the way the restaurant is run. From the minute you walk in the door you feel the nightmare begin. I the past they have always hired and had greeters that acted like 8 years old and had no business being employed anywhere other than an ice cream shop. They cannot for the life of themselves offer an appropriate wait time for their outside area.  The last time we came here (6 months ago cause I swore I'd not come back) we were told an hour for a Table. After an hour and a half I went to check on the table and guess what, we were forgotten. We left. Today we find a welcoming from a sloppy unprofessional attempt at a manager. I don't know what to say other than how sad.  Great location. Consistently good food in my opinion. Terrible front stuff and management.  Bar smells of that old stale water smell as u walk by.  Outside sitting area at 6 pm had food plates and beer bottles in removed from lounge area for over an hour due to a lack of attention to cleanliness or caring.  Sorry I came back.  Until the owner apologizes to Cornelius for such crappy attention to detail, we will not return.  I will say that the brick house tavern which I am told is owned by same owners is amazing."}
{"text":"Tasty food,great view friendly staff nice romantic place for a date highly recommended"}
{"text":"We went for lunch yesterday.  My Caprese sandwich was really good but my Husband said that his Cuban sandwich was just okay.  The views of the lake are great, our server was quick, and the prices are good."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after leaving a nearby restaurant because that restaurant made us wait 30 minutes before even taking our drink order and was serving other tables who arrived afterwards.  Port City sat us, immediately took our drink orders & we had amazing service from Shayna.  Delicious meal!!!  We'll be returning."}
{"text":"Since moving here from New York I've made it a point to try as many local non-chain spots as possible.  This is one of the few places I have repeat visited and have always been impressed.  Casual upscale, beautiful bar and dining room, outdoor deck right on the water, and the best dry rub jerk wings I've ever had!  An absolute treat every time I go.  It's tucked away, but more than worth the search."}
{"text":"Well, it just doesn't get better.  And I really really wish it would.  The best things about this place are the views, the pasta dishes, and Adam.  Otherwise, service is debatable   Walked in at 1pm.  Wanted to sit covered outside.  No problem waiting.   Outside bar closed (too bad because it is 80 and beautiful outside).  Went to main bar.  Stood there 5 minutes while the bartenders chatted amongst themselves.   Finally got drinks  Walked outside and sat at outside bar.  For 20 minutes, watched two tables sit empty.   Went to front reception and was told my name was crossed off \"by accident\".    Asked for the other vacant table.  Had a better view.  Was told it was being held.    Waited a long time.  Food was average.  I got up and went to restroom while husband waited to pay.  He's still waiting while I write this.    Oh, vacant table we requested is still vacant.  Good job Port City.    Won't be back.     P.S.   Last time I ordered the lamb chops and they were terribly overcooked and weirdly sauced.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Bathroom was dirty.  Food was averaged and WAY overpriced.  The drinks were ok, but don't think we will go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I wanted my entire review to say \"Go here. Just go here.\" But i suppose i'll have to expand on that...  This place is awesome. The decor is gorgeous, its right on the water, and it has so many different \"feels\" to it. It really has something for everyone. The main dining room hosts a huge sprawling bar and high end finishes. As you move away from the main floor twoards the window, you get some funky upohlstered chairs and smaller tables. Move onto the first level of the indoor/outdoor porch and you get another bar, rustic furnishings, and an overhang so you arent completely outside. Then... you get to the true outdoor seating. And wait... its not over. The last area is ON the sand, right on the water and hosts comfy outdoor couches, small fireplaces, and its right on the water.  We stayed for drinks and apps. Service was right on, the apps (lamb, tuna, dip trio) were fantastic. Too bad I was just in town visiting because i would love to go back for dinner. It would be my favorite spot."}
{"text":"The location of this place was great. It overlooks the water and is very pretty. The food seemed pretty good as well. The burger was one of the best I've had and the chips trio appetizer was good as well. The service was pretty slow and our server complained about \"getting stuck\" with a 6-person table to the hostess right in front of us which was a little awkward. He was pretty short with us the whole evening but was able to get us everything we needed for the meal. Overall though, this seemed like a great place to come with friends to enjoy the nice scenery and some good selections of food."}
{"text":"Great location. Incredible outdoor area, fire pit and deck. Cool hang out. Huge upscale bar area. It's actually on the lake."}
{"text":"Joined another couple for dinner here on a Monday night and we had a great time.  The zucchini chips with tzatziki sauce were an absolute fave (we ended up ordering more).  My husband had the chicken livers and I had the chicken rosette- both were very delicious.  We sat on the patio and it was a nice breeze from the lake blowing in, which made it a wonderful evening.  The service was excellent and the menu had a variety of seafood, steak, and chicken options.  My husband and I have a new spot to frequent in the area- we'll definitely be back to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Great dining experience. Our Server/Waitress Caitlyn was OUTSTANDING!   The only thing that stopped me from giving 5 stars was the lamb shanks were very bland.  My FIL and I both ordered the lamb shanks - and both agreed, they were bland.  Everything else was delicious and Caitlyn's service as I previously stated and is worth repeating, was OUTSTANDING!!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Service and amazing Beach View Will be back!!!!  Quality Food, great service and huge portions"}
{"text":"This place is typically pretty decent, but tonight we sat at the outside bar and the bartender was a little scary. She was openly fighting with other employees she spoke with, slamming bottles (broke one into the trash), and was pretty rude. The manager was awesome and offered to comp our drinks but we left to get a better atmosphere and chill out"}
{"text":"I love Port City but tonight there was no air conditioning. The fan above us wasn't working either. There were 8 of us and we were sweating. It wasn't even crowded. The waitress said \"sorry\"! Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way back from Grandfather Mountain.....the place was pretty packed. Our food and service was great despite the crowd. Rachel was really sweet and very good at recommending items. The lobster and shrimp rolls.....were Delish. Thanks for being a part of the birthday dinner surprise. The key lime cheesecake....winner!"}
{"text":"\"Sunday brunch, so disappointing! Came for the breakfast food and will not be coming back unless it's for lunch/dinner. Breakfast seems like a complete afterthought. They had 5 options only (pancakes, waffles, western omelette, eggs Benedict, or egg sandwich)--none of which are even on an actual menu (the server just lists them for you)--and the side pairings were odd for the pancakes and waffles. Instead of a meat or egg option, which is usually pretty standard with pancakes or waffles, your choice was home fries, grits, or fruit (and not the kind you would use as a topping). Pancakes and home fries? Or grits? Anyway, I got the omelette which came with toast, and added pancakes. Had to ask for butter, syrup, and they had no jelly or jam of any kind to go with the toast--not that they ran out, but they don't have it for toast. My boyfriend got french toast, and asked about adding eggs and ham, which they agreed they could do for an additional $8. He requested the eggs scrambled and cooked well, and his side of home fries done well. Both were underdone (potatoes were soft and oily--had no crisp at all to them). He let the potatoes go but sent the eggs back as they came out soft and a bit runny. They came out again so over cooked they literally had a dark brown crust all over them. He turned them down, and the excuse we received is \"well we don't normally cook eggs here.\" Umm...I'm sorry, but scrambled eggs have to be one of the easiest breakfast foods in the world to cook and you have your cooks back there poaching eggs for the benedict. The waitress took the eggs and told the manager on the floor of the covered porch, who was very close to our table and facing us.  Rather than come over to at least speak to us, he ROLLED HIS EYES and told the server to tell us he'd take the $4 burnt eggs off of our bill.  For me, that was the final straw. I felt we were being very polite about everything and to have management stand within clear view of our table and roll his eyes was very unprofessional and rude.  My father was in the service industry and I feel customer service is very important.  What's also disappointing is their food is normally really good, and I think they have the potential to develop a good Sunday brunch if they put some effort into developing it."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner, overall great experience. The servers were attentive and the prices were reasonable for seafood in the area. Great atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"The service was terrible on valentine's day. The candle on our table was out I asked for it to be replaced...never happened. Took forever to get refills.   I figured it was due to the amount of customers. Then walking out from the cold terrace about to leave I noticed everyone had bread and oil. We weren't even offered the bread and oil that ticks me off. Lobster mac and cheese should just be Mac and cheese because the lobster was no where to be found. Asked for medium well steak...it was more medium rare. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Gorgeous view combined with excellent food and service! The blood orange beurre blanc is subtle but exceptional. Even the bread before the mean is wonderful, crisp crust with a melt-in-your-mouth center. Crab cakes? Awesome! Shrimp and lobster roll? You'll think you're in Maine. Pasta? Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great place for relaxing by the lake with friends, family and enjoying a good meal.  It's an upscale atmosphere with low light visibility. Food was good. It took the kitchen a long time to get our food out, but it was a busy time of the evening. Wait for the table was short and our hostess was very friendly.  Price point was fair and reasonable for the upscale treatment you receive."}
{"text":"Wow, one of the best restaurants on the water we have been too. Although there are not many to choose from that you can get to by boat this restaurant truly exceeded my expectations. You must try the calamari is it was probably the best calamari I've ever had. Cannot wait to take my entire family back!"}
{"text":"The prices are quite good, the food is good not great, the staff is very hit or miss and the location and restaurant itself are both very nice (better than the food and service). Just go in with expectations lower than they seem to want to set and you'll probably have a good time. I could see it being a place I just end up returning to because of the venue and the prices (and again, the food is far from terrible, just nothing special)."}
{"text":"I came here the other day and sat inside, I've heard about this place but had never been. It was late at night so it made if difficult to view any of the scenery around us/outside, but the food was great and the service was good.  It was much bigger than I was expecting but the décor was kinda nice and calming."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about going here because of some of the reviews but was pleasantly surprised that we had a great experience here. The setting was ideal, right on the water. The food was good and the service was good enough. Would definitely go back for lunch or dinner. Great place you could come to on the boat as well."}
{"text":"Great food in an awesome venue.  This restaurant is right on the water, and boaters just drive right up, dock and come in to eat.  They have an outdoor seating area that has a more casual feel.  Menu is diverse and executed well."}
{"text":"Third time was not the charm for this place!! Burn me once, terrible service, decent food! Burn me twice, terrible food and terrible service!!! Third time...chicken sandwich was soooo over done that it was in edible!! Chicken wings were so raw, they red, not pink, bold red!!! Cuban sandwich was cold!!! Sent two of three meals back, Cuban was hungry and ate cold sandwich!  Did not get an apology from staff!! Nobody looking for a free meal here!!! Just a nice birthday lunch without the threat of salmonella poisoning!! Have already called health department!!!"}
{"text":"This place offers great food and an amazing view of the lake.  I've been to Port City Club twice (when visiting my mother in Charlotte) and I see why this is one of her favorite restaurants.  The service is very attentive and polite and the food is good.  This past weekend we went for brunch and sat in the covered patio area.  The temperature was just right and the view of the lake was so pretty.  I ordered eggs, french toast, and homefries, but the french toast was super soggy so I sent it back.  I ordered a pancake instead (omg, it was fluffy and delicious) and the manager came and apologized for the french toast.  In the end, he didn't even charge me for the french toast or the pancake.  I'll definitely be back when I visit Charlotte again in the future."}
{"text":"I came up with this 3 star rating by averaging a 2 for the service, 4 for the food and 3 for the beverages. Oh, also a 4 for the ambience. I guess that would be a little over 3, but that's enough math. I think that Port City has a great atmosphere and food. We had the Taxera flat bread, fried calamari, souvlaki, and oysters Rockefeller. The flatbread was amazing - chorizo, cilantro pesto, and manchego cheese plus perfect crust. The oysters and souvlaki were also great, very flavorful. The calamari was the only one that was so-so. Mostly it tasted like fried but the marinara was good.   Not to dwell on the negative, but service was slow and inefficient. We were quoted an hour and a half wait time with lots of open tables and then it only took :30 to be offered a table. Fortunately, this meant we got to sit outside on the beach patio. This I was fond of, as well as the inside space, which was open and well-appointed with great lighting. All in all, I had a good experience but it would have been better if the service were improved. But I'd certainly go back!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Port City Club was ok.  A few things need tweaking, but overall, they are off to a promising start.  Let me start with the good.  The interior is gorgeous - they did a great job making this a classy and comfortable place to dine.  The music was perfect for the setting - a combination of big band/jazz music on the night we visited.  (The volume could have been turned down a bit, though.)  Seating was far enough apart from your neighbor that you could have a private meal.  However, prices for some of the items are quite high.  My hubby loves meat and cheese trays, and very few restaurants offer them in CLT.  Port City offers separate trays for meat and cheese--at $12 each for three meats or three cheeses--and you have to take what's available that day.  While they tasted good, we feel they were overpriced in comparison to other restaurants with similar offerings.  Vivace, for example, offers a \"pick six\" for $13 and \"pick eight\" for $15, and you can choose from both the meats and cheeses.  We paid almost double at Port City!  I suggest that the chef reevaluate these trays and make some changes to be competitive.  But to be fair, some of their other items are well-priced.  I had the shrimp and lobster rolls for $12.  They were served slider-style, with three per serving.  I absolutely loved them!  They had little to no filling other than the seafood, and the dressing was light and tasty.  I chose the potato salad as the side, which was also good.  My hubby had a sandwich that was about the same price as mine.  He chose the greens as his side, and he enjoyed both.  Our server was initially a little annoying, as she proclaimed it might be hard for us to choose because the menu is so big.  Come on - the menu barely fills three pages!  She also disappeared for 15 minutes at the end when we were waiting for our check.  I hope we get someone different the next time.  And there will be a next time...we just won't get the meat/cheese trays again!"}
{"text":"Think of this place as in transition and really trying to distinguish itself.....original Midtown Sundries, a way fare destination on Lake Norman where one got off their boat for A/C and cold beer and a  sandwich. In comes new mgnt that presents a big menu to capture many tastes. The redo of the restaurant is impressive. Upscale , urban with huge padded backrests,  muted colors, big inside and outside bar,  sports tv's and lighting gives off great ambiance....add outside terrace and Sandy patio seating with marina view ...hey, it's very chicy  chic...and family friendly Ok why 4 s? Service is slow depending on time and day. We were there on Saturday eve 7:30pmish, but the apps and entrées remarkably good for a large service restaurant.  Oysters on half shell  delish, 1/2 pound meatball marinara very satisfying.  Fish tacos plus shrimp and scallops fresh, pasta delight. Saw lots of satisfied steak filet cutomers. Bottom line , the tap beers and house wines for $5 make your wait worth it...and the eclectric crowd and on the water venue adds to time we'll spent and lots of conversation both near and far...."}
{"text":"Everything great, food view, place, beer selection.  But brutally slow kitchen.   Makes taking the family a big challenge.   Maybe happy hour with adults but never again with families."}
{"text":"Love PCC! Lakefront dining with great food! What more can you ask for? This was our 3rd visit to Port City Club and it was awesome. We had to wait for about 30 minutes to be seated outside but we enjoyed drinks and the PC Trio appetizer at the bar, so no biggie! For entrees we tried the Lobster/Shrimp Roll, PC Burger, and Bison Burger.. all with their amazing fries!! Definitely give it a try.. you won't be disappointed.  PS: Of the 3 entrees my boyfriend has tried he ranks them in this order:  1. Po Boy 2. Lobster/Shrimp Roll 3. Fish Tacos"}
{"text":"This place has a great view but I would have loved to see the indoor and outdoor patios revamped after the Midtown days. Being one of the few places with lake views to hangout and eat, the outdoor cocktail area needs to be watched better on those nice days, it gets messy quick. BUT with that being said... the staff has been great in my experience as well as the food! I have had salmon from here that is fantastic. Tuna which is also great! There are some great pasta dishes too. Oh and the bread they bring out ... so good!  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great/interesting menu, yummy food (crab cake sandwich, wings and fish tacos were delish), and beautiful decor (not to mention the view)!  The young blonde female waitress that cared for our party of 10 did so with grace and efficiency- sorry I can't remember her name =) Would love to come back."}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love!  Excellent service, great atmosphere, the food is to die for!  It's awesome to have a place on the lake that has a little but of everything.  Keep it classy please!!"}
{"text":"Our evening started on a sour note thanks to the management and hostess staff--i was so embarrassed that I was responsible for suggesting this place for our date!   We made reservations for Friday night, 9/15. They didn't accept reservations for outdoors though and we were told it was first come first serve. My date arrived a half hour earlier than our reservation for that reason and was told it would be be approx 45 minutes.... He then watched as other patrons who arrived afterward were seated outside.   When I arrived a half hour later, I checked with the hostess stand for an update. The hostess was incredibly rude when I asked how much longer she thought it would be! \"I have no way of knowing that,\" with a little shrug. I responded she must have some estimate... She snapped \"it could be 45 minutes\".... When I said that's what my date was told a half hour ago, she just shrugged again and said \"it's first come first serve, you'll just have to wait.\" When I mentioned that it clearly WASN'T first come first serve since people who had come later were seated outside before us. She snapped, \" I know what first come, first serve means.\" Seriously?!   I didn't come to a nice restaurant to be treated with so much attitude, so I asked to talk to the manager. She claimed she WAS the manager. If that's true, I'm appalled that someone like her would be in a position of management. I don't want to risk going back - too many great restaurants in the area to bother being treated the way we were. (Brick House in Davidson, Campania in Davidson, 131 Main in Cornelius and many more!)"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this restaurant. While I've thoroughly enjoyed it every time I've come for dinner, I would DEFINITELY NOT recommend their breakfast. Very limited choices and unclear on for to cook scrambled eggs. First they were extremely runny next burnt. French toast was very \"mushy\" in the middle (under cooked). When the eggs sent back a second time they were well over cooked. I have to say, I probably won't be back for breakfast, but will be back for dinner. The restaurant has a good opportunity to do great business for breakfast on the weekend if they can ever get it figured out. I believe they need more that a couple of option and by all means, please actually print a brunch menus. Don't rely on your wait staff to relay the menu items  to your guests and for heaven sake, offer come sort of jelly, jam, or marmalade. Below are the brunch options we were presented with:  Western Omelet Eggs Benedict Egg sandwich Pancakes French toast Waffle"}
{"text":"Great place to celebrate any occasion!  Fire pits out on the sand covered patio with spectacular waterfront seating.  Service the first visit was still great.  Service last night was subpar, but the food, views and company made it s great evening."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Tuesday around noon. Decent crowd for that time but I was only one at bar. Ordered burger, fries, and Blue Moon on tap. Burger and fries were solid but not out of this world. Bartender was friendly and working hard.  Simple version: It's good, Not amazing.  Sitting outside next time. That's the real value here. Beer + water view = happiness."}
{"text":"If you come to this restaurant, only come if you expect to be treated as if the hostesses, bar tenders and waitstaff care *NOTHING* about whether or not you are there. Customer service is abhorrent.  We arrived at the restaurant and the hostesses were unfriendly and acted as if just putting our names in was an inconvenience. Assuming it was just a hostess having a bad day, we happily agreed to a 45-minute wait for first available seating. We thought we'd have some drinks, sit by the water and prepare for an ultra pleasant dinner. When we got to the bar the bar tender acted as if we were a complete pain to serve. There were six of us and we all ordered alcoholic beverages, everyone in our party was cordial but she was rude to every one of us, most notably when she said, \"I GUESS you can have that beer but just know that I'll have to go INSIDE to get it.\"  Now that this was the second unpleasant interaction, I started to feel embarrassed as the regular here when my out of town family was visiting and seeing how rude people were being.  The icing on the cake was being seated at a table that was directly in the sun. We very kindly asked if we could be re-seated (there was another table of our size that was empty) and they said, \"you can either sit here or go to the end of the wait list and wait two more hours.\" I understand having to wait if you aren't so keen on the table you are offered. But what was upsetting was that after agreeing to the table in the direct sun, we noticed that every group they brought to the table *next* to us (also in the direct sun) asked to be moved and they were moved immediately. Immediately. One couple, even though they were offered an alternative table, left the restaurant totally because the waitstaff was so unkind.  I don't know if it was discrimination for not being regulars or not being from here or just being different in some other unperceived way but the environment was absolutely unpleasant, if not hostile. No one looked happy there.  And on top of it, several orders received were incorrect, and some subpar. But... I guess how could that not have been expected with everything that had already happened before?  As a former regular here, I am embarrassed and a long time customer lost."}
{"text":"Good food, good value and great service. Port City provides generous portions presented in a timely fashion and appetizing manner.  I have tried a variety of entrees and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"What an amazing spot for lunch! It was early on a weekday, so really quiet, and I sat in the covered deck area with a beautiful view of Lake Norman. The crab cake sandwich was perfect. The bread was just right and the crab cake was very generous. The service was attentive but not intrusive."}
{"text":"Food was cold but collard greens were really good. My husband ordered mashed potatoes and his side came put wrong they literally took his whole plate to change the side dish. Crab toast was just okay and calamari was mediocre. Overall beautiful scenery but food was only ok."}
{"text":"It is unfortunate that a place with such prime real estate next to the lake lacks so much in service and the food preparation. It all starts with their hostesses, young college ages girls that have no interest in welcoming and serving the clients. When we got in, 3 of them were behind the desk in a conversation of their own and did not mind our presence, I had to say hello and breakup their conversation which they obviously did not like because of the way they looked at us and responded. We went in for lunch on a Sunday @ 3:00pm not a lot of people but when asked for the wait time for the outside seating area they said 45 min. when it was clear that there was no one waiting. We sat inside and the waiter, an older man, did not even introduce himself, just gave us the menus and asked what we wanted to drink. Brought the drinks and left. We had to flag him down to get him to get us appetizers. Brought the appetizers and left! Same thing again to order our Entrees. Then the Entrees came, we ordered 2 of the \"priciest\" items on the menu, scallops and shrimp and the halibut 2 orders of each (we were a party of 4). The 4 plates were awful! The halibut was overcooked and dry, the toppings were not fresh at all. The shrimp and scallops were definitely rushed to be thawed and were not fresh either. Overall we just ate because we were hungry and left immediately. I had forgotten why I had not returned since they opened. Awful service and the food preparation needs to be carefully reevaluates and fixed. I guess that for drinks and a great view it is worth it, definitely not for food."}
{"text":"Great restaurant on lake norman. We sat inside due to the current heatwave in the Charlotte area. The inside tables have a view of the water as well. The food was great and our server Jo did a great job making us feel welcomed. They are child friendly without being a kids restaurant, good for families & couples. The bar is a nice size with plenty of flat screens. Nice place."}
{"text":"Port City's ambiance and view is wonderful!  And the food doesn't disappoint either!  My husband and I tried just about every appetizer on the menu and they were delicious. You can't beat the outside patio on a beautiful day."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there with a group for dinner.  I heard raves from everyone around me about what they ordered and I sampled some calamari from a neighbor and it was perfectly cooked as was a bite of filet from another friend. The BIG disappointment came at the end of the meal when it took 25 minutes to get our bill.  The two waiters really dropped the ball on being efficient in that respect. It  put a bad chill on what had been a very nice meal.  I almost gave them a 3 star had the food not been so good."}
{"text":"Beautiful view here. However the food is just okay. I think my favorite thing is their bread that I've had to ask for twice. The pasta carbonara is pretty good, a bit greasy. The shrimp po boy was meh and had a small amount of shrimp on it. The fries were same as McDonald's shoe string fries.   Like I said in previous review, super cheap wine for the cost of a bottle or more. Like the wine you never drink because you know it'll make you feel hungover.  The servers were nice again but soooooooooo slow. We went 20-30 min with no one checking on us for refills. Then brought us the check with no pens. Awesome.   I'll come here for the view and maybe a burger, idk...hit or miss."}
{"text":"We love the food and service here. Relaxing lake views help melt away stress while you enjoy great food and conversation. Go to place for special occasions. Drink specials. Chef specials. Terrific desserts."}
{"text":"Ok, this place is nice but I think if they had better management it would be a nicer place. this place should be hopping but they turn people away and have all sorts of rule on where you can sit to have a drink or eat. I think it they had a better platform they woudl be the hottest place on the lake. The wings were really good and other appitizers were good, so its the atmosphere that has me off.   I just feel something is missing"}
{"text":"Come here for the amazing views of the lake, but stay for a great variety and quality of food.  Our table got a bunch of PCC trios for appetizers, which include guacamole, pimento cheese, and salsa accompanied with pita and tortilla chips.  All three were really solid, but my favorite was the pimento cheese by far.  For my entree, I got the souvlaki: lamb sirloin skewers with tzatziki and pita.  These were cooked amazingly well and had so much delicious garlic flavor.  The pita bread was already a bit soaked in the olive oil, so I opted to just eat a deconstructed gyro which worked very well.  Came with a very large party, but service was still on point, quick, and accurate.  The menu has a lot to offer for all palates!"}
{"text":"Why oh why is the service so bad here? They are sitting on a goldmine! The food was delicious and the location is 5 stars all the way, but the service was very lacking. We had drinks out on the beach where they acknowledged the previous patrons dirty dishes, but still took forever to clear them. Waited an hour for an outside table which would have been fine if we didn't see so many standing empty. Food took awhile, drinks took longer, and app plates never cleared when meal came. The server also spilled oyster water all over my purse and didn't even acknowledge it. Not sure why they don't hire more/better waitstaff since everything else is spot on!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the service is always great. Can't beat the view and the little beach outside. Defiantly worth the price."}
{"text":"Open the outside bar... Always! Play Reggae music... Always! Have full food service outside outside... Always! Or we'll all just go to Hello Sailor. Your move."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint.  I wanted to go somewhere that was located on the water.  So, I found this place on Lake Norman.  I'm so happy that I did!  The food was exceptional and the waiter was absolutely amazing!  He really took his time to explain the dishes we were interested in and ensured that our needs were met.  What a great guy (I wish I had gotten his name but I will when I revisit). I purchased the Pacific Cod Sandwich which was $13 and a Bloody Mary that was made to perfection and it was approx $9 give or take a few dollars.  There's both inside seating and outside seating. They also have a lower level deck that is closer to the water which has a small fire pit. Nice, clean setup! I'm definitely going back soon!  What a treat :)"}
{"text":"A lovely location with beautiful interior and plentiful outdoor seating. Attentive staff and delicious food, the sesame tuna wrap I had was quite tasty and they were accommodating to my small substitutions for side dishes"}
{"text":"We came here for the Valentine's Day special - four course meal, $55 per person. We had a great date night! The view was very pretty and I can't wait to go back during the warmer months to sit outside. Our waitress was very nice and we had so many to-go boxes!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find (at the back of a residential area), but it's a phenomenal location: waterfront, with boat docks, several large dining areas, 2 bars, a big patio, and a beach lounge. I can't understand why they don't do more with events and marketing, because Port City Club has enormous potential. They should seriously consider hiring an event manager and reaching out a bit more. Halloween party? Trivia night? Charity events?   All the servers are very nice, friendly, and gracious. Some of them seem pretty new to the job, but that's easily remedied by time and training. The food is usually very good, especially the appetizers. My only real complaint is the very slow kitchen. The food is great, but it always takes quite a while to get to the table (even for a 2-top). Otherwise, it's been lovely every time we've been here, and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here tons of times and always tell myself I will write a review and forget. They have the best food on the lake by far. We drive about an hour to get here, and have never had a bad experience. I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for good food and good vibes."}
{"text":"Location is awesome. Staff were nice. Tried to sit outside at 5pm and the sun was too strong so the hostess helped us move and she was nice about it. Pricing is okay.. we ordered crab cake appetizer, it was 3 tiny lil clumps for $12, tasted amazing but for that price i dont think i'd order it again. My husband got the bison burger, priced great at $13 and it was delish, i tired it too, very good! I ordered the grilled scallops and jumbo shrimp, pricier at $26 but that seems normal for scallops. They were very good, im not an expert cook and know its easy to over cook scallops but I wish they were grilled a minute longer. Random note; they dont have frozen daquari type drinks.  Overall great place and would definitely go again."}
{"text":"We stumbled onto this gem because we are staying at lake Norman next door. Very upscale and trendy. Huge patio overlooking the lake. Waitress was very friendly and gave many recommendations. They had a seafood special that fed 3 of us it was huge! The fried shrimp were fresh and cooked to perfection. The Cuban sandwich was raved about by my dad and he is picky. Large wine list. The patio has lounge couches. I'm sure we will be back before we leave. I heard they have a good weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Great place to come for a relaxing meal or some drinks st the bar....lots of dining options - inside, outside but under cover and outside.  I had the grilled shrimp and scallops MAYBE a bit over cooked but still tasted great."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, food and service is horrible. Nice location and view (if you arnt seated with the sun in your eyes) good luck gettin a hot meal here."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Port City Club was a spur of the moment, \"hey, we've never tried this place\" kind of thing.  My wife had a coworker who said it was good but as much for the summertime, sand in the toes on the lake part as for anything else.  Our experience was a combination of hits and misses that left us thinking, it's ok and we may give the place another shot come spring/summer.  Here's the rundown...    We started with a crab toast appetizer which was tasty but some of the crostini were burned, some were under-toasted and one was just right.  The cheese on top was just meh and had been melted and then left to sit and harden a bit too much before serving.   The wedge salad was fresh iceberg, with bacon and diced tomatoes served on a chilled plate with some very good blue cheese dressing.  It wasn't perfect though as the menu said served with crispy onion straws and there were none to be found.  My wife had a house salad which was mixed greens with some too sweet pomegranate/orange vinaigrette.    For entrees, I had the lobster and shrimp roll which was served, as it should be, in butter toasted split-top rolls.  The two rolls were packed with filling (more shrimp than lobster) that was dressed nicely and topped with arugula.  I asked for no fried capers but they arrived covered in them which was a bit of a pain.  My wife had spaghettini with a giant meatball in the middle.  She loved that the pasta was fresh made and the meatball was good.  She would have preferred more sauce but overall, it was good.  That's it on the food side.  Generally good but not great and we definitely liked all the variety on the menu and feel that is a plus that would help us come back.  It also may lead to the good not great on some of the food though.  It's hard for a place to get so many things just right.  The service was definitely friendly, a bit overbearing and on the hard sell side and without full grasp of the menu items (see above paragraph for a possible cause).  I don't need to hear a full rundown of 3 of the 8 or so apps, just pick one and be done.  Also, the tables where we sat are VERY close together so when he would stand between them his crotch was almost on the edge of our table and his butt on the table behind.  Thankfully, there was nobody sitting to the butt side. Just a little off-putting.  A longish review, I know but there was so much variation that it felt warranted.  Like I said, we will surely go back but, truth be told, if the meal was exactly the same in all these aspects, the second visit would likely be the last.  Too many other great and consistent options to risk $$ on good/great/inconsistent."}
