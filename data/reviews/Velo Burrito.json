{"text":"Lame. Went tonight around 10:45 PM, excited that this place is supposedly open until midnight (according to their own website) and also because I found the vegan Mexican idea foreign yet somewhat appealing. Inside, I found the experience disjointed and uncomfortable. Since I had never been there before, I stood at the entrance next to the bar and tried to get the attention of the barmaid to ask where I would find the actual food area and burritos. She gave me a not so nice look after I finally got her gaze and I had to repeat myself three times, as if she didn't understand the word burrito lol. She finally waved me over to the back and said \"in the room next door, they might still be open\". Might??? All I found was an empty, sad looking counter with a spotlight on it, and some people bowling. Even though I saw some employees walking around, they averted my gaze and I finally gave up. I didn't feel like I should beg to be served. And just for information's sake, they were not very busy considering it is a Friday night, so they had the opportunity to help if so desired. No need for me to come back!"}
{"text":"Always friendly, always great food. I never worry about gluten contamination either!  The LaChance burrito is my favorite, and the closest thing I can get to a poutine."}
{"text":"good sized vegetarian burritos. they deliver by bike year-round. i recommend the Patti burrito which has seasoned potatoes in it."}
{"text":"My life got better when Velo Burrito set up their home base inside NDQ and started doing bike delivery. My first taste came through the snow by bike up to one of my favourite local bars, Le Ritz PDB, where myself, the staff and several other patrons dug into burritos, tacos and nachos while drinking local beers. I've been back and ordered in a bunch of times since and tried a lot of the different menu items and figured out what my favourites are - I love the crispiness in the Patti burrito, and the sweetness of the pineapple tacos, and the overall mightiness of the nachos. Everything is vegetarian and there are lots of vegan options. The staff is chill and friendly and at $10 for a burrito the size of a fat baby's arm it's an affordable and filling and healthy meal. Extra good with beer and duckpin bowling."}
{"text":"Even if it's snowing like a MOFO out there, Velo Burrito is there for your fix. I have ordered numerous types of their vegetarian burrito and taco options and they are all solid, the burritos are about the size of a freaking cat: incredible!   Follow them on Facebook and you can see what the special burrito of the week is, they've had everything from a burrito stuffed with poutine to a spicy mac & cheese option, nom nom. Delivery has never taken more than 30 minutes and the food is surprisingly still warm even when there's been a foot of snow on the ground."}
