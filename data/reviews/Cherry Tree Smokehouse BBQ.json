{"text":"If you dig into my profile you will see that I do not review restaurants that often. In part it is because I simply do not think about it but also because I think Yelp can be a little unfair for a restaurant owner based upon a select few opinions. And let's be honest, how many times have you ever \"Yelped\" a restaurant, took one glance at the amount of stars it has received and simply moved on because it was not over a four. We've all done it!

In the case of Cherry Tree Smokehouse I decided to comment here based on three factors. 
1. The food that I ordered (Pulled pork sandwich, tri-tip pork ribs, side of fries) was delicious. 
2. The owner and staff truly cared about my experience and were very helpful in making suggestions.
3. Yelp is leading you to believe that, as of today, this is a 3 star establishment based upon 14 reviews. Not true.

If you like good BBQ and friendly people, this is your place. If you want to talk to the owner and inquire about their cooking process and different cuts and styles of meat, this is your place. If you like homemade macaroni and cheese made with FIVE DIFFERENT CHEESES, this is your place. Trust me, you will love it.

If you've made it this far in reading this I do have one last thing to suggest. If you happen to have a not-so-great experience, whether it's at this restaurant or somewhere else, try to let them make it right before making a permanent stamp in this digital world. 
Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I hate writing negative reviews of local small businesses, but it is what it is.

The pulled pork was ok. The spicy coleslaw was actually yum. The Mac n'cheese was cheesy. 

But honesty I really don't understand what bbq joint the rave reviewers on Yelp were eating at, because it wasn't this one. The pickle was bad (soggy, mealy, bad pickle). The potato salad was mediocre.  Buns were soggy. Mine was over toasted to the point of burnt in places, my companion's hadn't seen a touch of heat. 

And let's talk about my companion's sandwich well we're at it. Fully a 1/3 of the \"tri tip\" in that sandwich was inedible gristle. It's a bad sign when you take a bite of your sandwich and you can't get your teeth through it. 

To top it all off it took 20+ minutes for 2 sandwiches + sides to arrive, and the place was nearly empty. All in all the service was painfully slow, the food ranged from unmemorable to inedible, and it's pretty expensive for the portion sizes to boot."}
{"text":"I have eaten BBQ all over the country, this is by far the BEST Phoenix has to offer.
The people who work here are awesome. The owner happened to be there the night we stopped in, what a great guy.
Try the Pecan pie and the beans and cornbread could be a meal on their own"}
{"text":"Well.. the inside of this place is cute n quaint.. the food is alright.. but the prices are ridiculous..
Extremely over priced for the portion size. $14.00 for 3 slices of brisket, a piece of tx toast a cornbread muffin and a sm deli cup of cole slaw is nutz.
If you've paid attention to my reviews you would know how much I LUV meat.. 
I expect a decent portion of it when I spend this on lunch.
So in my humble opinion I'd tell any and all persons to head over to Tx bbq on roser and 24th st. Your still going to pay $14.00 fer lunch but at least you'll get a WHOLE POUND of yummy meat fer the same price."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq!  Pulled pork sandwich was fantastic. Hubby said the brisket was the most tender he's ever had. Very yummy!"}
{"text":"Service is \"down home\" good and the food is just as wonderful!  Quaint little place.  Mac and Cheese is delicious and their bbq is wonderful!  It's a new addiction for sure!!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork and mac and cheese is on point! The two meat combo plate makes this my favorite BBQ in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"I and my wife love eating at this great barbecue restaurant. We go there at least a couple of times a month We have begun inviting our friends to join us there to enjoy all the mouth watering selections that are cooked expertly and served in portions that satisfy my huge appetite for ribs and pulled pork. I especially love their \"cowboy\" beans. They are spicy and on the cusp of my limit but I do so love them. The staff always greets us with warmth and personal attention to our orders. The building is always clean and well maintained. You absolutely must visit the restroom when you go as I feel it is unique for a public restroom."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq! Some of the best in the country and great prices! This is phoenixes hidden gym!"}
{"text":"Really good BBQ especially pulled pork sandwich. They are now offering 2-4-1 on the pulled pork sandwich. Great pecan pie and good service. Eat in if you want to."}
{"text":"Terrifically friendly.  Succulent, tender, flavorful pulled pork.  Loved the spicy slaw, barbecue beans and mac&cheese.  Homecooked feel.  Nice array of hot sauces.  Very reasonably priced.  Sumptuous looking chocolate cake and pies.  And I hear the brisket is awesome.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best barbecue places in Phoenix. Really good food, the people there are really nice and genuine. Really good place to try out"}
{"text":"Wow.  Delicious. Great customer service and friendly clean atmosphere.  Worth the stop.  Will write more when I'm done eating ;) ."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today and were very pleased. We had a pulled pork sandwich and a bbq beef sandwich. Both were delicious. Also a generous helping of tasty fries and creamed corn. My only quibbles, which I consider minor: the serving of beef on my sandwich was much less than the amount of pork on the other, they have no unsweetened iced tea, and the price (about $11 for each combo meal) seemed a bit high. Aside from these, the food was delish and we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My mother & I passed by and noticed that this place had finally opened.  We were heading to get pizza but decided to check this place out.  As soon as we got out of the car you can smell the BBQ.  It's cute & cozy inside.  We ordered the brisket combo & rib combo to go.  We also got a slice of red velvet cake to share.  The young lady at the counter was super sweet.   We couldn't wait to get home to taste everything.  I really enjoyed the beef brisket sandwich which was more meat than I expected.  The barbecue taste was not as noticeable as in the ribs but I prefer it that way for a sandwich.  I tasted a piece of bbq beef ribs from my mother's plate and I fell in love.  The ribs have a delicious smokey barbequey taste and they were so tender.  I will definitely order ribs next time.  Funny thing is my mother liked the brisket better than the ribs.  The bbq beans were a perfect blend of spicy with a touch of bbq sauce.  I didn't care for the cole slaw but my mom loved it.  The potato salad tasted store bought but it was ok.  The red velvet cake was delicious so I don't care if it was storebought or homemade.  I think the prices are fair for a BBQ joint.  I was able to order brisket today as it seems by the other reviews that it was only offered on certain days.  We will definitely be returning here for more ribs & cake."}
{"text":"Totally satisfied my craving! I read the reviews and was hesitant to try it, but Cherry Tree exceeded my expectation! I had a pulled pork sandwich with spicy BBQ sauce and coleslaw. My coworkers tried it with me and they loved it also. We will definitely be having lunch here again."}
{"text":"Some of the best bbq I've ever had and prices aren't that bad at all. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"First time here since they opened, the pulled pork sandwich is very good with their spicy slaw, brisket is nice and moist, good service, love the baked beans but the potato salad tasted store bought which was disappointing. Overall good food, will return. Wish they would add some smoked meat to the beans however."}
{"text":"This place... I'm thinking of it and my mouth is watering. We go out of our way to find bbq places as a \"treat\" every once and a while and have decided that we're just going to stick to Cherry Tree going forward (also probably going to have them cater our small wedding BBQ after party - it's THAT good - and the staff and owner are SO down to earth and friendly) The Carolina Style pulled pork sandwich is amazing, the mac n cheese will make you dream about it, the coleslaw is on point (no mayo ridden goop there), the beans aren't the super sugar kind, but the pacan pie is - and we fight over who gets the last bite.  It's off the beaten path for some e.g. not in the best of the best neighborhood but if you put aside the stigma of where it's located the trip is well worth it and hopefully the owner will be there - he's really friendly, fun to talk to and built the restaurant / bakes / is a jack of all trades.  Put the story behind the business, the food and the staff together and this is why we love coming here."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in today to see if we could find a new BBQ place to call our own. We've had little luck finding real BBQ in our area. We were excited about Frasher's opening, until we visited and were disappointed with the prices and some of their food. Enter Cherry Tree Smokehouse. One of the owners gave us the lowdown of the menu and good suggestions, which we took.  We tried their pork rib tips, brisket, and pulled pork.  My wife said she thought the brisket was the best she's ever had. It had a good smoke flavor, without being overpowering. It was nice and tender with plenty of juiciness and pulled part easily. The pulled pork was also excellent. I usually avoid pulled pork at BBQ places because I've been disappointed too many times with it being dry and uninteresting without a sauce. Their pulled pork had a great smoke flavor and was still wet with fat and juices, without being dripping in fat. What a great balance. I didn't use sauce  except to just give it try. The pork rib tips were good, again excellent smoke flavor, a little tough but not too bad. I'd probably order them again. The owner said the ribs would be more tender. The tips and I presume the ribs didn't appear to be dry rubbed, rather just smoked and sauced.  The house sauce had a good sweet and tangy balance, I could taste the molasses, but it wasn't overpowering. Their spicy sauce tasted like their house sauce with a little extra kick that lingered,  but easily dissipated. I didn't feel like i needed to guzzle a bunch of liquid to put out the flames. Again they seem to have found a good balance. For sides we got the beans, coleslaw and mac and cheese. Beans had a great sauce base with pinto, kidney and black beans. Very tasty.  Their 5 cheese mac and cheese was excellent!  Coleslaw was just average and came in a small cup.  Their fresh lemonade was very fresh tasting and had a great balance of sweet and tart. 
So to sum it up,  we we very impressed with the overall quality and quantity of food for the price. The small sit down area was decorated nicely, but the AC was having a had time keeping up. 
I can say for sure that we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Finally went to try for myself today. I've followed the reviews here with interest, and wondered what I'd think. I was really hoping they'd exceed my expectations. 

Didn't work out that way. 

The ribs are okay. Decent smoky flavor, plenty of meat on the very large bones. But the texture, which to me is the hallmark of slow smoked ribs, was off. I personally think rib meat shouldn't fall off the bone, and these ribs met that test. You still need to chew. But the dryish flakiness you get with perfect ribs is missing here. I suspect the ribs are cooked with more than just smoke. Perhaps steamed a bit? 

Sauce is not bad. Sweet, but not overpowering. 

I ordered two sides with my to-go order. (Also, why is a half rack not available as a combo? Why did I have to order my sides at the much higher a la carte price?) I ordered spicy slaw and mac and cheese. My total was around $18. Not bad for a heavy BBQ lunch. 

Mac and cheese wass okay. Not my favorite. I prefer it creamier. This mac is kind of clumpy, and I've never been a fan of bread crumbs on this side. They just make it dry and sandy, instead of smooth and creamy. 

I would love to tell you what I thought of the slaw, but they left it out of my bag. 

I would love to have good BBQ this close to where I live. Cherry Tree, unfortunately, is not going to make that happen for me."}
{"text":"Maybe this was just an off day but almost everything was dried out and/or soggy. They claimed that the beef is brisket but if it was, they either overcooked and reheated it in sauce or it's low grade (select probably) and too lean. The pork was dried out and had very little flavor. Ribs were tough and undercooked. The creamed corn was more like soup that had a few pieces of corn in it and the mac & cheese was so soggy that I'm not even sure there was any mac in it. 

I don't know where these good reviews are coming from but unless I just got extremely unlucky, they're either people who only eat at bad chain BBQ restaurants or like their meat to be more like leather. 

I really wanted to like this place as the people running it seem like good people but the food just wasn't good. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was a waste of $50 for one 4 meat plate and 2 kids meals with drinks."}
{"text":"Wouldnt go here again. The ribs were not great and they didnt come out warm. They also had a lot of pull to them and were not tender. The mac and cheese was on point. The sausage and cabbage was a joke. There was maybe an 1/8 of a sausage in the dish. Overall not that great."}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich was pretty good. The baked beans are a huge portion but they use the spicy bbq sauce to make it. I don't like spicy foods but I was still able to eat it. The potato salad isn't bad either. Hopefully it was a one-off but I waited 5 minutes alone when I entered, waiting for service. I even opened and closed the door to ring the bell again. A group of 5 men came in behind me and we waited another 5 minutes until a cook finally came out and noticed us, then went to get the cashier clerk. That was frustrating. But I'd probably go back to try their pie."}
{"text":"Very good bbq. I had the pulled pork but it should of been a bit more smokey. Spicy slaw its a little hot beware. I think for the price they should include a drink though. It's a small place so your probably better at getting it to go during lunch hours. People here are very southern like. That's nice for all the Arizonans."}
{"text":"First time at Cherry Tree BBQ. Arrived at 12:30 for lunch on a summer Saturday and there were three other tables full. 

My wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich with two sides: fries and creamed corn. I ordered the pork rib combo with: 4 ribs and two sides which were corn bread and Mac N Cheese. 

The counter service was exceptional. He was patient with us, explained the options, offered his opinions and made us feel comfortable. He also checked up on us twice after we got our meals. 

Pulled pork Sammie: good but not great. Definitely needed sauce but it had good flavor. They were running 2/1 that day so we got an extra one. Nice. The fries and creamed corn were okay. I thought the corn was runny but my wife said she liked it. 

My ribs were good: good smoke and chew, cooked nicely and sauced just right. They gave me 5 ribs, just cuz. The corn bread was eh. It had jalapeño which I like but needed something else. Maybe honey baked in?  The Mac was outstanding. Good creaminess, crispy topping and dark spots. Good stuff there. 

The restaurant itself was decorated nicely with old-time decor but lacked AC, and it was 108 outside so it was suffocating. That was a big turn off. 

I'll probably be back, due to location but I think I'll take it to go."}
{"text":"Loved the pulled pork sandwich!! This is a terrific family owned, neighborhood BBQ shop! I could eat there every day of the week!!"}
{"text":"We both had pulled pork sandwiches, my boyfriend had his Carolina syle when he found out they had soldout of TriTips for the day. The pork was cooked to perfection, and the sauces were very good too. My boyfriend was a fan of the slaw, and RAVED about the Mac and Cheese. I had the beans which were flavorful as well. The customer service was amazing, and three other groups had arrived by the time we were leaving. People are finding out about this place, which is well deserved."}
{"text":"This USC Gamecock loves the Carolina BBQ at this place and feels just a little more at home in AZ. They nailed it. The two vegetarians I was with devoured the slaws, corn, and Mac and cheese. We tried every side and they are all good. Still cant decide between the regular fries and sweet potato fries. Pecan pie and cherry pies are both well made and on par with low country restaurants.

Glad to see meats in catering sizes and hopefully sides will come in catering sizes soon for parties.

If you don't mind paying a few bucks more for well made food this is the place. Otherwise, well, I hear Arby's has huge BBQ portions and there is always the McRib and Mcpies if you are not fussy."}
{"text":"We went and got take-out last fri night. Prices are comparable to other bbq places. They said their \"style\" is Arizona and also do South Carolina sauces.  
The pulled pork sandwich is pretty good and a good size, the ribs are decent...if we had just gotten those it would be more toward maybe 4 but a solid 3.5 at the very least.  I got brisket.  The bottom of my box was left very oily while the meat was super dry.  
Another thing that knocked them was the fact that the counter girl couldn't tell me anything about anything on the menu or their style of bbq. Doubt I will give them another try since we have the awesome TX style place down the street from us."}
{"text":"Glad we came to this just opened BBQ spot! There was plenty of meat on the ribs and the pulled pork carolina sandwich was good too. The cashier recommended the bbq beans and I'm glad she did bc they were really good. Will be back to try more.."}
{"text":"This should be a 1.5 star. I really wanted to like this place. I had been watching them get ready to open since the fall as I drive by this location almost daily, and had been looking to find a place closer to our home that is as good as Honey Bears BBQ on Central downtown, where I frequently get my BBQ delights.
MARK MY WORDS: If the owners of Cherry Tree don't up their game and get competitive with other already established BBQ places in Phoenix, this business will FAIL before Labor Day. Here is why:

1-THE MENU IS INCONSISTENT.  It is written on a chalkboard and it seems given the various reviews I have read, different days have different offerings: like brisket only available on certain days. My wife and I were there last night (WED) around 645pm and they only had sandwiches and sides. No meat platters/combos and of course no brisket (My fav). I didn't even see mention of ribs on there.

2-THE PORTIONS ARE TINY and/or INCONSISTENT.. We ordered a BBQ chicken sandwich combo and a BBQ beef sandwich combo. Both with coleslaw one with fries one with creamed corn. The sandwiches were SMALL: regular hamburger bun with MAYBE 3oz of meat on each (think less than a can of tuna) you couldn't see any of it around the sides of the small bun, you had to lift it to be sure there was anything under there. A MINUSCULE 1.5oz container of coleslaw (the cheapest thing to make) offset by a fairly large order order of spicy fries, which were good, and a half-pint of creamed corn, which seemed oddly large next to the shot glasses of 'slaw. If it hadn't been for the corn and fries we would have had to make popcorn an hour after we got home.

3-THE COST. A sandwich with 2 sides is $13-$15. Sandwich alone $10??!!!! For what amounts to what should be about half that price. Why? Because one need only view Honey Bears BBQ menu online to see that they sell their sandwiches which are much fuller for $6.49. A combo with proportionate sides is $4.49 more so $11 for way more food. You can buy just meat at Honey Bears for between $13-$16 a POUND (16oz) all of their sides are $2.49 for 8oz, and that includes things like collard greens and mac 'n' cheese.
Basically we paid $30 for 2 meals that would have gone TWICE as far at Honey Bears, and they offer ALL MENU ITEMS ALL THE TIME.

4-THE FLAVOR/TEXTURE. It should be noted that the server who brought us our food mixed up the orders and I was given my wife's chicken sandwich and she got my beef and WE DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE UNTIL THE END! This is because they drown the meager meat portion in sauce so you can't taste anything BUT the sauce. She thought her chicken was stringy, I though the beef was a little light. We both agreed in the end that the chicken was the better of the two but neither was great. We also ordered a hot-link on its' own for $4.49to try it. It was like something out of a hot Smokies package from Safeway, and it was COLD. By the time we tried it we had resigned ourselves to just getting the food down and leave as we were starving and we had things to do later, I would deal with it on YELP.

The service was fine, but I got the impression the kitchen was being run by one or two teens. Perhaps in such early days the OWNERS might want to run the show until all the kinks have been ironed out from open to close. That's what needs to be done. You close at 8pm and don't serve breakfast. Suck it up and stay at work until you are CONFIDENT you are running a tight ship.

I worked in restaurants for 22years. The restaurant business is tough. If you want to be successful you have to know your established competition, know EXACTLY what they offer their customers and how, for what price and then do BETTER. Otherwise the contrast is glaring and you will fail. Simple as that. One need look no further than Honey Bears BBQ, an established, respected and loved business with 2 locations in the area to see where Cherry Tree is falling WAY short of the mark.

No one is reinventing BBQ. It's been around a long time. My mother has a house in North Carolina and I KNOW BBQ. Cherry Tree isn't worth it by a long shot. Take the $10 you'll save and drive to Honey Bears or any other well established BBQ place and enjoy your BBQ experience. 

I won't be back to Cherry Tree because there is no need to ever go back. I  drive by 2 other places all the time that I know are good. Perhaps it's time to channel Ben Franklin and put that Cherry Tree out of its misery? I will monitor this place on YELP, but am skeptical they can make the drastic changes they need to in order to be a competitor. I have a feeling this place was opened by someone who felt they had skills at BBQ at home, but had never operated or worked in  a successful restaurant. Maybe Honey Bears is accepting applications? You think Im being glib (which I am) but I'm serious. The guy who owns wildly successful Lolo's Chicken and Waffles was a cook at a chicken and waffles place for long enough to learn the business and then make it better."}
{"text":"Found this place randomly on yelp. I went in and got very good customer service. The food was nothing less than excellent. I got the beef ribs which in my opinion were blessed. The Mack and cheese... The best I have tasted at ANY restaurant in AZ. The baked beans.. Not only better than any rest in az, just the best..
I have yet to eat the Red Velvet as the calories digest:)"}
{"text":"Prices extremely high. Prices were a big turn off. Weird parking areas. Sample of pork bellie seemed like it was steamed. Really didnt like it. Brisket sandwich was dry and there was no smoke flavor. Bbq should never need salt."}
{"text":"I had the rib tips. Well cooked and flavorful, But barley warm. Ribs were just above room temp and sauce wasn't warm either. Made for a rather unpleasant experience. Spicy slaw was interesting, pleasant, tasty with mustard notes. Service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I liked it. Food was very tasty, service was wonderful, portions were very good. Atmosphere was charming.

 I'm not sure why it's not busier, nor why others knocked it so badly. Prices are a little high, but a combo plate with a drink and a side, and high quality ingredients is going to cost a bit. Clean, relaxed atmosphere, and a great selection.

Thumbs up for me!!"}
{"text":"Took a friend this time.  He commented on the small sides and lack of portion size.  What really got him going was the man behind the counter had a beard and it didn't seem sanitary. 

Brisket was fatty and mushy this time.  Not very much smoky flavor."}
{"text":"Okay firstly, I am from the South, so I grew up with \"pulled pork\" as the definition of barbeque. This place has pretty good stuff at decent prices I think. The interior's nothing fancy but it wasn't uncomfortable and was fun to read some of the signs on the wall. We got a good amount of food, and the sweet potato fries were yummy. My boyfriend was happy to have real bottled Mountain Dew. It wasn't busy as we were the last of several customers to come in and the last to leave, so when I went back to the counter to get a to-go box, I did have to ring the bell to get someone's attention."}
{"text":"Came in on their first month anniversary food was pretty good the ribs were pretty big and a bit chewy. the New York cheescake and chocolate cake was delicious! Nice a quiet environment no music nice place to conversate!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. I'm giving them one  star for one reason: they lied! The desserts in their glass case are allegedly \"home made\" but coincidentally, Costco has the exact same desserts that Cherry Tree allegedly \"makes from scratch.\" 

The BBQ is pretty good, the Mac and cheese is good and the creamed corn was fantastic. I would give them 4 stars except I am now left to wonder if they make anything in house or if it all comes from Costco....all in all, I won't be back...because they're bogus.  Too bad, because it's a pretty cool place."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ!! The pulled pork and smoked pork belly is delicious! Definitely will be coming back here!"}
{"text":"The brisket is on point. The mac and cheese is the last thing I want to eat before I die.   Can't wait to go back for the beef ribs. 

Service is polite and folksy. I found the prices to be a little under the going rate for BBQ."}
{"text":"EKK- Pass this place. 

I came into this place for the first time the other day and i was having high hopes for a new, awesome BBQ place close to home- this was not it. 

At first glance, i was surprised to see the menue only has brisket on select days, no mac-n-cheese anywhere in sight and the prices are on the high side. 

I ordered a split meat platter- pulled chicken and pulled pork, corn bread and chips. My meat was such a small portion i was shocked- not to mention, my pulled chicken was not pulled, it was roughly chopped and tasted like cheap chinese food quality chicken. the cornbread was filled with jalojenos (which it did not say on the menue!) and the chips were a small bag of lunch sytle lays... The pork was good. I have to give credit when credit is due. 

Other than that, the server was slow and could care less that she took forever to refill drinks or that she took a long time to bring the food to our table, bringing the food in shifts with 5-10 minutes inbetween each persons food. 

The cherry on the cake was when we were getting up to leave we say her offering samples to other patrons so they could try the different types of meat before they picked their meals- We would have LOVEDDD this option, bc had we tried a few things before we picked we probably would have been much happier."}
{"text":"Wow.

So I was waiting for this place to open for the last year as I drove by it daily on my way into work. Finally gave it a try with my wife tonight because I was craving BBQ- why was that? Because BBQ is the bomb.com.

I was quite disappointed in Cherry- enough so for this 1 star review.

Firstly, the menu is absurdly limited. No Brisket except on Friday and Saturday. Luckily it was a Friday as I was looking forward to brisket- or Perhaps unluckily as if I had come on another night I likely would have just left. I ordered the brisket special with cole slaw and corn bread, my wife had a two meet combo (chicken and pulled pork).

Firstly, on the subject of service- my wife's food came out 5 minutes prior to mine- you'd think a place would coordinate our meal together? My portion was far too small for a 13 dollar special combo as I left starving. I've reviewed other barbaque places commenting that portions were small which charged less than this and served more food. BBQ classically leaves you full and satisfied which this did not. This brisket was tender but needed sauce which did not come on or was cook on the meat. My meat was 3 star. The cole slaw was coal slaw, a little bitter which I actually enjoyed. My other annoyance with my meal was the corn bread which was jalapeño corn bread. I was not told nor are the jalapeños listed on the menu. Luckily I'm not allergic but I would not have chosen that side had I known.

My wife's meal was a better portion but the meat was of much worse quality. The chicken tasted rubbery like it came from the fast food chicken used in a mall food court. Her pulled pork had good flavor and also was 3 star pulled pork.

Both meals came with Texas toast which in my view was the best part of the meal. 

Also, what barbecue restaurant doesn't have Mac and Cheese?? I'm confused? 

For our combined food we paid 33 dollars. I might have given 3 stars had the price been half of what it is. I'd much rather have gone to Dickeys. The food is better, cheaper and more filling."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's amazing , the food is great and I like that they make the majority of it there!

Why i'm knocking it down two stars is that there have been multiple times now I or my husband go out of our way to pick up food and they are out of it. It can be 5 or 6pm and they'll tell you they ran out of the mac and cheese and aren't making more. Their cobbler they don't make throughout the day so at lunch you'll be lucky if you get a piece. 

If they could keep their food in stock so we are always not dissapointed they would definitely get a 5 star!"}
{"text":"Spicy BBQ Chicken Carolina was delicious. The chicken was well smoked and was just as tasteful without the sauce. Corn bread muffin was just right. Not dry at all."}
{"text":"Had the brisket. Being a native Texan I am a little biased about my brisket but it was delicious. Had potato salad and beans as sides, both delicious as well. Finished it off with pecan pie. Staff was friendly and helpful, will defiantly make this a regular BBQ stop!"}
{"text":"They are opened on Sunday  ....I've had the best pulled pork sandwich and by the way the sweet potato fries were on point ....rib tips are great on point ."}
{"text":"Cute place, food-not so much.  The beef rib I had was extremely tough and the brisket was not very good either.  Sides we just so-so, as were their two different sauces.  Best part of the meal was the canned soda."}
{"text":"Walked into the Cherry Tree smokehouse today, place was empty except for 1 table at 11:45. not a good sign so far. no real direction on what to do when you enter except to go to the front desk and wait for someone to show up. looks very under staffed. I only see 2 people running around. this is lunch time! any good place for lunch has a lunch rush and prepares for it! i asked for a sample of the brisket and it took 10 minutes just for him to have the other guy slice it and finally give it to me. there was no line behind me when i ordered the sample... and when i finally got the sample i had 10  people behind me. so i ordered my food before i got the sample in hope to help them process these people quicker, but it was just simply understaffed. then sadly i was not impressed by the flavorless chewy brisket. does not even come close to little miss BBQ brisket. finally,  around 12 a lady showed up to help them, just in time for the rush. i ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a combo. what is the combo you ask? not sure. had to get back in line after my order to figure out what comes with the combo and for goodness sakes give me my drink! i thought that was standard. then dude gives me a can of Dr. Pepper. little disappointed that there is no refills. $11.86 for a combo and i get a tiny little bite sized looking corn bread, some cheap chips, and a can of soda. where is the value? my pulled pork sandwich looked like it got the crap beat out of it, then grilled to warm it up for serving. not saying thats what they do... it just looks like the most haggard pulled pork sandwich I've ever seen. so i finally started eating and the pork was dried out, so i rescue it with a bunch of BBQ sauce and it was decent. not flavorless, but needs a lot more flavor. i did eat it all so it was edible. really wanted to like this place but it lacks flavor and customer service. i saw all the poor reviews for this place and had to see for myself. so i conclude that it's over priced and the value is not there. it has potential, so i'll visit back in about 6 months to see how they are doing. good luck Cherry Tree you have a nice little place."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to some delicious BBQ for dinner and was thoroughly disappointed.  My wife and I dined for about $30 ( not including an underserved 15% tip). What I got was worth about half that.  Two strips of semi-dry brisket, burnt Texas toast, and decent 5-cheese Mac and cheese with a can of soda for about $15.  Not even close to being worth it. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very nice owners. I love the pork ribs. Brisket is the best in Arizona. I'm from KC so I think I know  BBQ. 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"You gotta try this place!! Ordered the platter with pork and beef. Watched some one from the kitchen walk out front where there was a whole hog smoking with pecan. He sliced my order off the hog in the smoker.
Best smoked pork I've ever had!!!!!"}
