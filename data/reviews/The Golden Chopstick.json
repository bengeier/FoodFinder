{"text":"Standard Americanized Chinese fare.  Their lunch specials are pretty good for the price.  The owners are really nice so that's why I keep coming back when I'm craving something small like a wonton soup and eggroll.  Give it a try when in the area."}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice so far when in the area and both times, we've been quite pleased with the food and service.  It's mainly a Chinese take-out set-up although you can dine in...just expect to eat on styrofoam plates with plastic utensils.  Nice portion sizes, standard calibre of Chinese cuisine and friendly service.  Last time we picked up some dinner take-out, our order qualified us for a free entree and we chose chicken fried rice, it was a full-size entree too, sweet!  Can't go wrong if you enjoy your Chinese food."}
{"text":"I can find better tasting Chinese food for the same price. Their vegetarian menu is awful. I only go here when I'm desperate and I'm always disappointed when I do. But the staff is quite friendly."}
{"text":"Was ok, we ordered from justeat.ca (a delivery service here in Toronto) we were hoping this would be our new go to Chinese place, but it was mostly bland.
A few spices would help.

I even ordered the spicy combo, but the chili chicken was not spicy at all.

They got pretty good ratings from justeat.ca, so we were expecting better, but the food was just okay.

Silly that we live so close to Agincourt (home to hundreds of authentic Chinese places) but we crave Canadianized Chinese food"}
{"text":"It's ok food. The owner and people are nice, the food is good for the price. But don't expect to be wowed by the food. It's just cheap and good for sustenance"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. We ordered Chinese for our usual new years eve dinner. Couldn't find a menu online so we ordered some standard fare: chicken balls, beef fried rice, General Tsaos chicken and a mixed vegetables.  The food overall was just meh. The chicken balls and mixed vegetables were good. Unfortunately the fried rice was bland and lacked seasoning.  The General chicken was mostly breading and was also lacking flavor.  Prices  were very reasonable and service was fast and friendly.  We are still searching for a go to for Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"Very good food always fresh and hot lovely lady who works there too..the sweet and sour is sexy...."}
