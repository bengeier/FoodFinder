{"text":"OK, as an avid Yelp user I have to admit, I made a mistake when I picked this place out.  Why?  Well we were looking for a Mexican meat market (Carniceria) to get some specific cuts we like.  Our typical place had closed and we were not near home (we were in south Glendale) - so I did a yelp search while parked at a stop light.  this place came up with 5 stars, i clicked on the address and followed my GPS.  later I realized the 5 stars were based on one review, had I realized that i would not have bothered.   The good news is, I still went and found a better than average Carniceria.  It was obvious from the display cases that the butcher took pride in his work.  Items were displayed nicely, with plastic covered items where appropriate.   He had what we sought, carne adobado and carne arrachera, we bough 2 lb and 3 lb respectively.  We cooked it up on the grill that evening and found them to soft and tasty.  The butcher even prepared the meats as requested.  They were both hand cut and appropriately thin for nice grilling.  Note - this is not a very large store, more of a little neighborhood shop.  Also, the cashier was in a bullet proof cage, indicative that later in the evening  it may not be the best place in the world to be getting your Mexican butchered fare.  We felt safe when we were there at 4 PM on a Friday."}
{"text":"Dint be afraid of the bullet proof surrounding the cashier, i recall seeing it 10 years ago when glendale was a really high crimed are, but its gotten better....anyways the carniceria is good. Their meats are fresh, i will admit its higher than avg price. The one thing i really like is their chicharones. Not the thick ones but the smaller narrow strips. They grill chicken on the weekends on the charcoal you will see if you ever drive by."}
{"text":"Owners are very nice and they offer a good selection of meats. I wanted a nice, thick \"hanger steak\"  and all they had was pre-sliced arrachera. (It sells the most, so it would make sense that they pre-sliced it.)   The butcher wasn't familiar with my request, but went out of his way, opened a new bag of meat and gave me the cut I was looking for, instead of brushing me off and saying he can't help me. Fry's or Food City wouldn't of done that for me, so that's why I buy my meats here.  They will also marinate your meat free of cost and sometimes have promotions where they throw in a bag of ice if you buy meat/beer."}
