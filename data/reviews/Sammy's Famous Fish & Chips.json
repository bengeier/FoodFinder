{"text":"Sammys food is decent but the service is hit and miss. Owner runs the business on his own so be prepared to wait if it's busy. Having eaten at many busy chip trucks in Ottawa this guy would never survive. Get some help if you want customers to return.   I have eaten there many times over the years but today I waited for 1/2 hour for a order of fries ( nothing else) - likely will be the last time due the inconsistency of the service which is consistently inconsistent."}
{"text":"Best place to eat fish & chips in Oakville. Our family's favourite on nights where we just want to have a light simple dinner."}
{"text":"This is the best fish and chips in Canada. I grew up in Newfoundland and it's even better than maritime fish and chips. My parents totally adore it and I LOVE the fries. The food is always delicious and the fish is fresh all the time. It's hand made to order, not just sitting around and Sammy is the nicest guy to my parents when they order. My mom and dad and I literally go once a week or more because it's so good! The best place to eat for sure!"}

{"text":"I have lived in the GTA for a few years now, and I'm a big fan of fish and chips. After spending a lot of time in the UK, I was trying desperately to find a place here that didn't use more batter than fish, five-week old potatoes for chips, and didn't try and pass off plain mayo mixed with some relish as tartar sauce.  I found Sammy soon after I moved here, and I had heard great things about his food. I ordered a fish and chips, and oh my goodness. The batter is deliciously seasoned, light and crispy, the portions of fish and chips are so filling, and Sammy is the friendliest man in Oakville. He goes out of his way to make conversation with you, and you start feeling like family the more often you visit him. Another time, I had a hotdog, and his hotdogs are always perfect. They're heated all the way through unlike some hotdogs I've had in the past, and the toppings are fresh, flavourful, and refreshing. He is always happy to give you extra tartar sauce (that you don't pay for, unlike Chippy's in Toronto), and as many ketchup cups as you need.  The food is reasonably priced, even for Oakville. Sammy only takes cash or debit, and that annoys some people, but a lot of people don't understand that if he were to take credit, he'd have to increase his prices-- Sammy's food is worth keeping some cash on hand for. His cart is a staple in Bronte, and I am so glad I found it when I did; it is honestly wonderful food that never ever feels heavy, greasy, or bland, and anyone who says otherwise needs to reevaluate what they think good food is. I go there all the time (literally, at least once a week!) and the quality has never declined, even on his busiest days."}
