{"text":"A guy who boasted so much in a local community news edition, served chicken nuggets when asked for chicken pakora and added little bit of spices to it. I wondered when chicken pakora become a chicken nugget and become a part of Indian cuisine.

The food is only so so, even though liked customer service, they should correct these blunders. I expect them to say we don't have chicken pakora at this time rather than selling an indian chicken Nugget."}
{"text":"Shalimar Foods was bought by another owner in August, and is now called Lahoris Dhaba. The food is very similar and really quite good.

{"text":"The owner is a very friendly person and the food is pretty good in comparison to the local Indian restaurants. It is a small place with seating capacity for only 10-15 people, so large groups beware. They pay attention to your preferences and you can customize the dish to your liking by telling them exactly what you want.
I have noticed that other indian restaurants use something in their dishes that makes me queasy after a filling meal but not here. I guess they use home style ingredients. It is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant and the prices are very reasonable.  I have gotten addicted and seem to end up here about once a week.   It is a little hard to find since it doesn't have a big sign, but just look for the thai place next door. The food is awesome. every time I go I try something different. I haven't gone wrong yet. Try the shashi paneer and the aloo gobi. They are both the best I have had. The breads are also great. Service is very courteous and everything is cooked to order.  On the downside, the menu is limited and it is a true hole in the wall. Everything is very clean but it is the opposite of fancy. Food is served in to go containers with plastic utensils. If you are picky about ambiance, get it to go."}
{"text":"Firstly, the owner is a very humble guy who is the server, the chef and the host. He is an all in one package. The prices are unbelievably low and what you pay for you get 10 times much better food. The food is as authentic it gets and the owner makes you feel comfortable at all times. Undoubtedly the best Indian food in the valley. Come here if you want to have the taste of Real India."}
{"text":"It is important to realize that different restaurants are meant for different occasions. Also, I look for value for money where value can be in the form of a delicious meal, ambiance, or personal service. I go to this place for a hearty meal and personal service.

Indian food can be from different regions and therefore can contain different ingredients, heat levels, and flavors. This place primarily serves north Indian food with tastes that can only be found in roadside restaurants in India. Food is, in other words, on the spicier and slightly greasier than what one would typically find in the Valley. The owner can customize heat levels though.

I have tried different dishes but one of my favorites remains Chicken Curry. Unlike many other places, meat is tender, flavorful, and often oven baked. Curry does not contain cream which is a big plus in my book. Chicken Tandoori (oven-baked chicken) is my another favorite. Chicken is moist and, unlike many other places, not rubbery. Everything is made to order so be prepared to wait.

A typical Yelp snob like me would typically take off one star for lack of distinct and pleasant ambiance but then this is not the place to go with your date or a romantic evening. This is the place where you can go with alone or with a group of friends and have a delicious meal."}
{"text":"One of my favorites to get Indian food. This place doesn't have a fancy ambience. Its one of those hole in the wall places with limited seating. But the food is AMAZING. great veg samosas. Chicken and veg biryani are also awesome. I also loved the chicken katti roll. But ask them to reduce the rice in it. The take away orders are so huge you can barely finish them. Value for money and fresh food.
And not to forget amazing customer service by the chatty and friendly owner..."}
{"text":"The menu has changed due to new ownership, but the food is excellent! The menu posted on this page is not correct. We tried the spicy chicken tiki masala. It was very flavorful and authentic. I would have to say it's the best I've had in Arizona. We will definitely be back. The owner is kind and he also told us they will be adding to the menu soon. It took 30 minutes to get our food, but it was worth the wait! Fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night due to positive reviews on Yelp.  We weren't disappointed.

We ordered chicken tikka masala and chicken tikka.  We are those rare people who actually don't like spicy food but love Indian as long as it's cooked VERY Mild.  So I always order super, super mild.  It had no heat at all so he nailed it on the first attempt, which almost never happens for us.

The flavor was AMAZING.  The sauce had an incredibly fresh taste brimming with intense flavors and fresh herbs, so much so we couldn't get enough.  It's not exactly the taste I remember from our days in California but unlike other Indian restaurants that fall short at imitating the taste, this was just so amazingly unique in taste that I'd put it on par with the best I've had, just uniquely different.

Since our favorite Indian place in AZ closed (India's Grill), we've been disappointed over and over trying to find another place.  This will be our new favorite.

Just be aware, it's really only good for takeout.  As others noted, it's so tiny and not really outfitted for dine in.  Also, it's really hard to find because it's so tiny.  The storefront is only about 10 feet wide and it's tucked between a Chinese restaurant and a nail salon.  I drove by twice and didn't spot it; the owner had to talk me to it!

And as other's have noted, it's truly the owner and one other person cooking everything from scratch so it takes longer (over 45 minutes from the time I ordered).  But there's something really quaint about the whole experience; it's like you're visiting their home and they're whipping up some home cooking back in the kitchen.

Oh, and as noted, prices are very good.  Generally about 20% less than I'm accustomed to paying."}
{"text":"If you are in a mood for some real good and fresh sub continental food, this is the place to be. Not a place known for its ambience. It has just four booths but dont be mistaken with the looks of the place. The owner is a really nice person who has a passion of cooking and making sure his customers leave happy. The food is prepared fresh and it will surely satisfy both your taste buds and hunger pangs."}
{"text":"Great hole-in-the-wall Indian spot! I highly recommend the the burrito- style chicken in naan meal. Actually, \"meal\" is an understatement. I'd be surprised if most anyone could finish it on their own. Better to share this item. The biriyanis are quite plentiful and tasty as well. Thumbs up for the mango lassi! There is not too much sitting room or an available restroom, so be prepared for some fabulous food and a hand wash at the end. If you are a fan of Indian food, you MUST try this place. I'm betting you'll keep going back. The owner is very friendly and humble and will give you proper recommendations for your palate."}
{"text":"We found this place from Yelp a few days back, decided to give it a try. 

It's very small, 6 booths I believe, but you wouldn't want it any bigger. 

They have no employees, it's the owner only, which takes your order, makes your food and delivers it to you.  If you're in a rush, perhaps not the correct place to go as everything is made fresh.  I think we sat down for lunch and ate and it took about 70 minutes or so. 

The owner is a good guy, he treats his customers with respect and isn't there to become rich, he's there because it's his passion, you can tell. 

We'll be back for sure."}
