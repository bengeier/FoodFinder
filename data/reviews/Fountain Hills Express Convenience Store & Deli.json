{"text":"Good people. Good food. Lots of beer.

Any questions?

Don't let the name or size of the store fool you...

My girlfriend (Who is from the Greater Chicago area) says their Italian Beef is authentic. The best she has had in 20-some years!

And that egg salad- best execution of a simple food item. Fresh-made for every order and no joke. I'm addicted, and am now a multiple-stop per week junkie.

Thanks for that, Fountain Hills Express Convenience Store & Deli.

{"text":"Way overpriced. Sup-par sandwiches. Non fuctional ice machine so they are cheap about ice. Most expensive cigarettes in town. Borderline rude. I live across the street and work a lot so I need tons of drinks and ice ect... you would think they would be more nice and accommodating to a person that could be a great daily customer. Instead I drive across town to go to Chevron of all places. No thanks."}
{"text":"This place has great food and and great service with a smile.  Must try the food.  Gyros and fries awsome, burgers great."}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection and awesome customer service. You can order a fresh made sandwich while you browse the beer selection which is above the standard for a convenience store. The staff is friendly and the owner is passionate when talking craft beer. If you believe in supporting small businesses this is definitely the place to visit."}
{"text":"Excellent place to stop for Eat-in or carry out breakfast or lunch.  Because it's also a convenience store you might not realize the have some of the best gyros and Chicago style Hot dogs in town. 

The people are nice, the food is excellent  and the price is right. 

It's not exactly a sit down restaurant but they do have a couple of small tables you can sit at and eat your sandwich or whatever."}
{"text":"We are so happy to have found this GEM of a place. In the last week, we've had the pleasure of indulging in the Chicago and Chile cheese dogs, the Italian Sub, potato and macaroni salad, tuna and chicken salad. In a fact we came twice in one week to get freshly made tuna and chicken salad just to have in the fridge. 

The food here is so good because it's fresh, lovingly prepared and always nicely presented. I have never eaten at a convenience store and sat down and enjoyed a meal but what can I say, the food never makes it out of the store...it's that tasty.

My two favorite things so far is the chicken salad (it's PERFECT) which I'm buying at 1/2 pound a week and the toasted Italian Sub. I literally can eat the chicken salad as is. It's freshly made every day and it tastes like it. The Sub has the perfect combination of bread to meats to the vinaigrette sauce. The smaller sandwich which I had for lunch yesterday was so good that the same day my hubby wanted it for dinner and we came back a few hours later to order a full size sub.

Yeah it was really tasty.

As far as the owners and their staff, we have had nothing but positive experiences from the husband and wife team that own this place. They obviously take great pride in providing quality outstanding service, good food and a spotless retail establishment.

This is a wonderful place to get good food and quick treats."}
{"text":"A local convenience store featuring a small deli that serves up decent subs and hotdogs. Friendly workers, too!"}
{"text":"We love this place, truly a Special Fountain Hills hidden treasure in our estimation.  Why? Because of their fantastic food. We have tried an assortment of their salads and sandwiches and super onion rings and never been disappointed. The couple who own and operate this place are so helpful and accomodating, those couple of negative remarks must have come from people who were drunk or rowdy coming in. If you,re planning to take a drive or take your dog to the park, stop off here first and pick up a lunch. Better than any of the local fast food places. I.M.H.O."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while now and going back and forth on menu items.  I have a few favorite items here but it seems I can't stop ordering the Italian sub. I'm not much for salad dressing on sandwiches but this Italian sub is the exception. The flavors that explode out of this sandwich are amazing. Every single time.  Other favorites include the Philly cheesesteak, the deluxe, and the gyro. They also have a decent burger and the fries, onion rings, etc are always tasty. 

Basically. You can't go wrong with anything on their menu. 

As far as the market?  Well. Hands down they have the best beer selection in fountain hills. They update the selections regularly but there are plenty of brews that are always stocked. 

Owners are locals who are invested in fountain hills and know how to treat customers well. 

Fountain hills express. Best deli/ market in town!"}
{"text":"The deluxe sandwich was great. The onion rings were great. The Greek wrap was great. The beer and wine selection is super impressive. The store was immaculate and the gals inside couldn't have been friendlier. I love this spot."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Been coming in for years.  Food is always made to order.  Cool schwag for the kids and the best selection of brews!  

Try the pepperoni melt...oh, the hot Italian beef.. the list goes on.. and on."}
{"text":"Yum! My Buffalo Chicken sub made up (and then some) for the lackluster potato salad.

Great beer selection."}
{"text":"They have some of the best onion rings available in today's market coming from a true contour of the onion. They are simply prepared for sure professionalism every time.Absolutely spontaneity delicious...."}
{"text":"Great food! Had Italian subs for games today. Super fresh and great eating. Best subs in AZ."}
{"text":"One of the best sub sandwiches are made here. The turkey and bacon sub is the best. Everything is fresh. Owners are very friendly. Lots of cool and neat things/drinks in the store."}
{"text":"Very friendly but too friendly at times. I stood in line for 5 minutes waiting for the cashier to be finished with a conversation that looked to involve a regular customer."}
{"text":"Who knew!!!  One of the best places to grab a meal in Fountain Hills!  Simply splendid!"}
{"text":"The largest selection of craft beers in the East Valley, coupled with the lowest beer prices in Fountain Hills makes the FH Express a hot destination in Fountain Hills for beer lovers.

Marlon and Karen took over again in November, 2015 and it really shows!  Great selection of goodies at super prices.  The breakfast  and lunch sandwiches are amazing. For you Windy City transplants, you will find honest to goodness Chicago Dogs, not wannabe fakes.

The Fountain Hills Express is a town jewel, but don't just take my word for it, check it out when you're hungry for a great lunch or breakfast. And pick up a six pack of some of the country's best beer."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  Every time I come in here, the staff is so nice. They truly care about every guest having a great customer experience. N they have awesome food, and a wide selection of craft beers and wine.  What I like best about this business is how much they care about making their customers happy.  I live within a 2 minute walk of this store, and it's so nice to know that basic supplies such as milk, juice, and dinner are just a 5 minute walk away."}
{"text":"Goooooood food. And best customer service!!!! Me any my husband alway go there for a quick lunch. The place is always very clean and the owners are super friendly"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town.  Very juicy and delicious.  Nice friendly service.  But the onion rings are over price coming in between 35-50 cents each - way too much.  But those Cheeseburgers Yummy Yummy."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue since I've been coming here regularly for a while. This place is excellent, the owners are great and super helpful and friendly. The beer selection is excellent and the food is outstanding! I can not say enough great things about this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of craft beers & kind/helpful owners/employees!  Karen & Marlon ROCK!!!"}
{"text":"So good!!! First time in today, subs are simple but so yummy!!! Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"We come here when we are at our FH home in the winter, but the owners and employees remember us even when we're away for 8 months!  

I'm a beer guy, and really appreciate the amazing selection of top rated craft beers.  And I break down from time to time to enjoy their amazing sandwiches.  I was very pleased to see that they added panini sandwiches since last winter.

My wife was pleased to see that they expanded their wine selection last Summer/Fall which helps me when I am there to buy, ahem .... beer. :)

Note the kid below whining about being refused service when he tried to illegally buy cigarettes. #1 It's Arizona state law that you cannot sell to a person when it appears they are a middleman for minors (tobacco is the same as alcohol.) Former neighbor said he came in a car full of teens, #2, the brat started dropping F-bombs in front of little kids.  Heard all about it from our former neighbor, Tom S. who was in there with his two kids. He said that he is sad that he wasn't in there by himself or the kid \"would be buzzard bait out in the desert.\" Had to laugh at the visual. I don't think smoke infested carrion is what they are interested in."}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab a sandwich and a cold drink !!! Not your typical convenient store. Definitely a Fountain Hills staple. I like going in once in awhile and talking to the owners about what's going on in town and hearing all the gossip that a small town like Fountain Hills has. They offer a little bit of everything there that your typical convenient store has to offer... But, you can also get an amazing sandwich at the same time. Make sure you try the \"Italian\" on white, won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Inconspicuous convenience store.  Ordered 2 Chicago dogs from deli side then walked a couple steps over and grabbed some chips and drinks from convenience side. $6 for 2 Vienna beef hot dogs and it was very good.  I'll be going back.  They have pretty big menu too."}
