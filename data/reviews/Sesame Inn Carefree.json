{"text":"Wow, food was amazing, and staff was super friendly.  Definitely has a Mom and Pops vibe.   Highly suggest Almond Chicken, Mongolian Beef (I believe the meat they use is filet mignon), CRAB PUFFS, and Pepper Steak.   Most people are used to Mandarin style Chinese food (aka Panda Express). If you're not familiar with Hunan or Szechuan style food, you won't understand Sesame Inn."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is a cozy atmosphere and friendly staff. The worst thing is the food. I tried this restaurant for a takeout dinner for my family, so I ordered several of the dishes and I sat in the restaurant while they were being prepared. We usually get takeout at Jade Palace, and I was hoping to find Chinese food at a more reasonable price and preferably less greasy. This place is just as expensive if not more so. The food I brought home was terrible. All of it was bland, beige, and soupy, some vegetables probably came out of a can, and all of the vegetables were over cooked to mushiness. The whole family was very disappointed."}
{"text":"I visited here with my dad for lunch.  Frankly, I thought it was terrible.  However, the beer was nice and cold - so gotta love that.  My dad seemed to kind-of enjoy his meal, which makes me wonder if I ordered poorly.  But the thing is....I can't even remember what I ordered.  I know the egg drop soup was just god awful.  I tried pouring in about a gallon of soy sauce, but no dice.  It was a meal that I hardly ate and 30 minutes that I will never get back.  I don't think I'll go here again when I am down visiting my dad.  But, they get two stars because my dad said his meal was, \"fine.\"  And, again, cold beer."}
{"text":"Family style portions and delicious food. The House Fried Rice is the best, great portions of chicken, shrimp and beef. It sometimes gets a little too busy, but during the summer months it's great for locals, since the tourists leave."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for 4 and was told our bill was $84.00.  When hubby went to pick up order they said they made a \"mistake\" adding the order the first time and now the bill was $110.00!  A $26.00 mistake adding!  Just said they were sorry.  Had we not had out of town guests we would have left the whole order.  HOW can they not add correctly as we were on hold for 5 minutes waiting for the total.  Never order from here again."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of dozen times. Good food and value for the money. Friendly service. I'll be coming back until a sushi or thai place opens up in area."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. It certainly won't be our last.   Charming atmosphere, not too noisy. Very friendly service...and quick.   The food was some of the best Chinese we've had a while. Their version of egg drop soup was outstanding. We combined House Fried Rice with Kung Pao chicken. Delicious!"}
{"text":"One of only a couple chinese restaurants this far north.  Unfortunately, they have raised their prices recently.  They were already high priced for chinese food but now they are in the unacceptable range.    The quality of the food is average at best.  The egg rolls are big but mostly all cabbage inside and quite dry.  The beef with vegetables is very good with very tender beef.  Stingy with the white rice on carry out.  They even have the nerve to charge an extra $1 for brown rice!  For my money (and better food) travel just a little further north and go to China Joy."}
{"text":"Great meal. Wonderful \"off the menu\" Egg Drop Soup. Quite a wide variety on the menu. Everyone in our party was very pleased. Good service. A nice neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food ever!  What a wasted opportunity on their part with the population of at least 5 upscale communities. And the $$$ for what you get ridiculous.  Sesame beef floating in bad tasting oil, Kung Pao chicken w/barely any chicken and just plain bad. Thankfully ordered string beans so ate on the brown rice that we paid extra for. This whole experience cost $50.  Do yourself a favor and go to Pei Wei where you can get food maybe a little better and at half the price!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for good food at reasonable prices. The ambience is basic. The staff is friendly and efficient. They offer takeout too. I have eaten there many times and not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Been going here about once a week.  Yes, the decor is older and the food is 'traditional chinese'!!  If you are in love with PF Changs (which I do like) or some other new fangled version of Chinese food - do not come here.  If you are under 30, you may not like this place because you want hip and excitement and don't even know what Chinese food from 25 years ago is like or should be.  I recommend this place over and over.   For those who say it is expensive, well i would like to know where you are eating that is less expensive in North Scottsdale area.   If you are from out of town, hello, everything is expensive here.  This is a nice family owned restaurant and I've never had ANY rude experiences.  They are very nice !!  Thank you Sesame Inn!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be much much better years ago. They recently made cuts to their food and instead of large plates of food and free noodle things... They give you half the food, no noodle things, and still charge the same amount.  Last time I ordered the General Chu chicken which tasted very old and fridge tasting. The tea tasted bad- I guess on the account they do not have filtered water. Will probably not be caught in there again-- too high of prices for small portions and old food."}
{"text":"I told my daughter, let's just grab some pedestrian uninspired generic Chinese food.  And that's exactly what you get.   But it is like just getting a fast food burger, you set the bar fairly low.  This restaurant will meet your reduced expectations  food hot, quick, boring and was fine for me as far as to portion size, but I think most people would expect more quantity for the price  Nice service, quiet when we were there   They did screw up my bill by adding a $25 tip accidentally.  Quickly dealt with, but check your bill  I live down the road so it's not a big deal for me, but for gods sake don't drive from anywhere south of 101.  Cave Creek and Carefree have lots of great fun restaurants unique to the town atmosphere, this is not one of them.  The Sesame inn could be in Lincoln, Nebraska or Fargo, ND. You have been to this restaurant before somewhere in America  and, if you're like me some days that's all you need from Chinese food.  Some days.  Just not a lot of days.  That was me, my daughter hated her meal, and brought it home for the dogs    C'est la vie"}
{"text":"the worse food I have had in a long time.  HOW do people like that stay in business.  I was s bad I took it back and left it sitting at the front door.  So much for giving it a second chance."}
{"text":"Drive up to Carefree for lunch, stop in at the Sesame Inn. Their original Chinese creations are tasty, reasonably priced & all served in CLEAN surroundings. I'm a BIG fan."}
{"text":"We had takeout tonight for the first time. The Food was excellent and the portions were large. Seasoned just right and lots of meat. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We finally found a Chinese restaurant worth going to over and over.  The service is attentive, warm and friendly.   The atmosphere and decor is beautifully designed. We ordered egg foo young, pork fried rice, wonton soup and sweet and sour chicken.  The food was delivered quickly and very flavorful."}
{"text":"We just ordered take out and showed up after thirty minutes. The order they gave us was for someone else, lucky we checked ! After waiting another thirty minutes they found our order, now was it going to be cold? We got home and started eating. The potstickers were good, the fried rice was just ok but that might be because with the delay in our order you could say it was like eating leftovers. However the taste of generals chicken left nothing but the sting of salt.  It was so salty that we ate only a bite or two hoping it got better; even with a swig of wine it was too strong.  I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went with my son and his family, it was our first time there.  We found it to be a very nice place.  Food was good And service was very good too!  I will go back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Love their Pad Thai! !  They consistently serve \" scrumptious\" food!  They have reasonable prices for the quality."}
{"text":"Very nice servers/wait staff.  Food was very good!  Spicy fried rice actually had some heat to it!  They even have REALLY good tasting fortune cookies!!"}
{"text":"How can you rate a place bad because of price?  If you are staying at The Boulders I am guessing that the price of food is not an object.  If you are expecting Panda Express then go find one.  There might be one around the Wal-Mart off Carefree Hwy and Cave Creek.  I bet you Price Haters complain at Morton's, Mastro's, Ocean Club, Tonto, Cartwrights, Harolds, and Black Mtn. Coffee shop.  Probably can not afford to go to these places.  This area Scottsdale, Carefree, and Old Town Cave Creek in not for a person on a beer budget it is pricey...might be too pricey for a beer budget $5.00/bottle for domestic beer.  So Expect High Prices. Whew, awesome food, start off with Wor Won-ton soup, order lunch salad, salt and pepper shrimp, House Fried Rice & Noodles. Great Place and service.  Great at any price...same as Tonto, Cartwrights etc. Ta Ta you price haters go to Panda and find something to bitch about there."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Chinese restaurant. I have since moved away from the area but still make an effort return. The food and service are always awesome and always consistent. The egg drop soup is the best one I've found in Arizona and my favorite dish is the chicken lo mein or chow mein. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've given this place multiple chances and am not going to waste my money any longer. They never seem to appreciate my patronage-- can't ever get a \"thank you.\" Skimpy portions too-- does not filling the white rice containers full or giving soy sauce without having to ask for it really save that much money?  But the real deal breaker is continuing to get my take-out orders wrong. Two times in a row I got the wrong tofu dish. Too many other options to not consistently get great food and service."}
{"text":"Myself and two friends order a light meal for take out from Sesame Inn after a long day - BIG MISTAKE. The food was inedible. The Hot and Sour Soup was orange. I have never seen orange Hot and Sour Soup and if the color didn't turn you off, the taste certainly did. I can honestly say I have never had anything like it. The Mu Shu Pork was watery, poorly seasoned and the pork was just about nonexistent. We also order a chicken dish and to be honest I don't know what it was supposed to be and I don't remember what it was called. We were not looking for gourmet, just someone to feed us a warm meal after a long day. We ended up throwing all of the food away minus about 7 bites.  Unfortunately the food quality was that bad and for the price (which was not cheap) we expected something at least reminiscent of Chinese food. I can only hope that the night we were there the cook had quit and the dishwasher was filling in. Nevertheless, we won't go back."}
{"text":"Ambiance is great.  Very comfortable restaurant.  If you are used to traditional Chinese food, you will probably be disappointed.  If you have shellfish allergies, be very cautious and ask questions.  There is shrimp in almost everything.    Egg Foo Yong was small and sparse.  Only two patties.  The gravy was like a stew, with so many vegetables that it smothered the flavors of the entree.  The won-ton soup had beef (I think) and shrimp in addition to the pork.  The flavor was good, once you get used to the assortment of other flavors.  I can't really rate it poorly, aside from the extremely non-tradition preparation."}
{"text":"Have come here a lot over the years, very friendly staff, great service and constantly good food at reasonable prices. Thai spicy curry chicken is my favorite as are the egg rolls and soups. They do a nice Lobster sauce here also."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced, because there are no other Asian restaurants nearby. Ordered Singapore noodles and pad Thai. They are over $15(!) at dinner time (and came with half a box of white rice--why? I don't know!), and almost $10 at lunch (with yummy salad). The pad Thai did not come with a lime wedge and was thin. Although fresh tasting, it was bland and tasted like Chinese stir fry."}
{"text":"This is a very good Chinese restaurant, we have gone there for years. I am shocked by the bad reviews and would suggest you ignore them, this is good Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Uninspired Chinese food and poor service (with the exception of the friendly young hostess, who doubled with bussing duties that the wait staff neglected!) We were a group of 10 the evening before Thanksgiving--plates came out late and haphazardly, then were not removed from the table when finished. We had a diverse set of dishes: it's not worth comparing in detail the sesame beef vs thai panang chicken vs other stuff, as all were bland and not distinctive. A Mayonaisse Chicken dish, to our chagrin, was no more than that: chicken in what appeared to be clumps of Hellmann's mayo or something. Decor was fine but a bit odd. Only reason this doesn't get 1 star was that I did not come with high expectations for Chinese food in this neighborhood anyhow."}
{"text":"I walked out of this place $30 lighter and wound up eating maybe $5 worth of the food. Just ugh. The Sesame Inn doesn't have lo mein on the menu - WTF kind of Chinese restaurant doesn't have lo mein? - but the hostess (I was ordering takeout) recommended chow mein instead. The noodles were spaghetti noodles, not Chinese noodles. The sesame chicken was nothing more than a fried, sliced chicken breast with some kind of watery soy sauce on the side to pour over the top, absolutely no chili paste or thick sticky sauce. Egg rolls were doughy and had little flavor. I've had way better meals from cheapy Chinese places in NY that charge $5 a plate. I can't believe I wasted $30 on this crap. It gets two stars instead of one because the restaurant itself, from what I saw, was clean, quiet and nicely lit and the staff was nice.  I don't understand why it is so freaking impossible to find good Chinese food in the Valley that's not from a chain like Pei Wei. In the last several years we've managed to get good pizza places here - can we import some East Coast Chinese? Of course, I realized last night that if I thought the last six or so Chinese places I've eaten at were terrible, maybe the problem isn't them, maybe I just don't like Chinese anymore!  Nah. It's totally them."}
{"text":"This is one of the the best Chinese restaurants in the Scottsdale/Carefree area.  The people here complaining about the prices must go to cheap Chinese Buffets! Where can  you go for lunch for $10 and get a salad or soup, egg roll, main course with rice and tea? Everything we've had here has been excellent. The lettuce wraps are our favorite appetizer. You will not go wrong at this family owned and operated restaurant. We love it and suggest you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Tasty food and friendly staff. They keep the intrinsic spice level pretty low and supply chili oil on the side, so everyone can enjoy all the dishes. We had Panang Chicken, Spicy Eggplant, Walnut Chicken and enjoyed them all."}
{"text":"2/1/2013: Sesame Inn still getting an A Grade from Maricopa County Environmental Services. :-)  My family has spent thousands of dollars here since 1999.  Mostly because the staff will always do special orders with an \"oh, sure!\" sort of joy.  And it's the only decent Chinese in the Desert Foothills (Shanghai Club in Anthem ain't bad).  There are two Chinese menu items I sort of use as a test:  Spicy Eggplant and Hot & Sour Soup.  Either are often quite obviously *wrong* in other restaurants but not here.  Spicy Eggplant is EXACTLY how one would hope and dream this dish should be -- the eggplant is creamy / cooked to perfection and the yummy sauce displays green onion and garlic equally to the palate.  And it's always served really good and hot.  Hot & Sour Soup also has a number of distinguishable flavors floating around in it.  (As opposed to the too-thick salty goop many places pass off as Hot & Sour.)  The sour (vinegar) is always perfect.  I always order it without pork but no one else at the table seems to care because the deliciousness is nevertheless quite potent!  Oh, and this soup is chock full of all kinds of exotic vegetables.  This place is a bit pricey but there is a certain pride of workmanship going on here."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have left a review after using Yelp many times but this  restaurant warrants it. This was one one of the worst Chinese meals I have had...Panda Express is better, and I won't eat that! I should have been clued in when I saw the \"splash marks\" not cleaned off the walls or the hard water stained glasses, but sadly I was craving Chinese food so I overlooked the \"ambiance\".  The soup was bland, the egg roll was greasy and served with  sweet sauce that had the consistency of jelly, the moo-shu was rolled in the kitchen (as opposed to table side) so I had to open it to apply the overly salty sauce, and the beef with vegetables was just gross. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID this restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Sesame Inn since we moved here six months ago.  We do not eat meat and are so happy with the tofu offerings.  We particularly like the Spicy Thai Basil Tofu.  Hearty, spicy, vegetables that are al dente and the tofu is cooked just right.  The service is always excellent. Food is always hot off the stove and consistent in its preparation.  We are \"regulars\" now."}
{"text":"Good dinner. Fresh reasonable prices standard Chinese restaurant faire.  Will come back."}
{"text":"This place looks nice and is pricy for a Chinese Restauant.  We were staying at the Bouders resort and decided to try this place because its across the street. .  This place is not very good at all.  The food is greasy and portions small. Please save yourself some money and don't eat there.  We could not even finish our food because its so nasty.  We had to order pizza again Because we were still hungry."}
{"text":"I would be DEVESTATED if this place ever closed.   Been going there for about 12 years now and I still have not had better Chinese food.  As a kid i would always get the lo mein and would literally lose my mind when I parents told me were going to Sesame Inn!  Since then I have branched out and gotten other things. The Singapore style chaoi  Mai fun,  pad Thai,  broccoli beef, and Kung pao chicken are some of my favorites.  I've only had maybe one dish that I didn't like.  Everything there seems to hit the sweetspot of being not too salty or greasy and always saucy enough.   Do yourself a favor and eat here, and while your at it order yourself a cup of their off the menu egg drop soup."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Boulders and in the mood for Chinese food.  I checked it out on Yelp and the Sesame Inn came up.  We actually walked over from the Boulders and were seated right away.  We started with potstickers and then I moved on to an egg roll and chicken with string beans - it was absolutely delicious.  I am actually craving this dish as I write this review.  Next time we stay at the Boulders, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My man and I are in the processing of moving so we decided to grab some to go food from Sesame Inn. We ordered about $60 worth of food (we love leftovers) - BAD MISTAKE! Waste of money. The Mongolian Beef had zero taste, didn't even taste like what Mongolian beef should taste like PLUS the meat was ORANGE! What the what??? The short ribs were so dry it tasted like beef jerky on a bone. House fried rice was ok but the lack of protein in it was next to nothing. Crab puffs were dried out, almost like they were sitting out for awhile. The white rice was filled half way, like they ran out and didn't want to make more.   Do yourself a favor, locate another place to eat. I do not recommended this place. It was disgusting."}
{"text":"this restaurant is a total embarrassment to any chinese restaurant.they have been in the area for 20 years and charge for noodles, rice etc. the new trend is updated chinese where you serve the customer. $28 for two small buckets and soup. everything is an add on. in the next 12 mos, these people will go out of business and deservedly so. they are leeches.they are living in a 1990 world.they should not be operating"}
{"text":"Excellent Ordered sautéed green beans, house special noodleS, and sweet and sour pork, two beers and a large hit and sour pork Perfect for two adults and two growing boys, a level above most Chinese in quality and certainly in service."}
{"text":"Love this place! My family has been coming here for yeeeeeaaars. I usually try to go for the lunch specials. The service is always quick and friendly, and the food is delicious. My favorites are the general chu chicken, house fried rice, and they have these chocolate cream cheese wontons for dessert that are delicious."}
{"text":"Decent enough little Asian place, food was okay, ambiance was good, like China meets Arizona."}
{"text":"I love this place! When you walk in the door, you feel as though you're in a 1960s film. It's old school, not like \"fusion\" places that are rampant as all get out. The service is always wonderful; the chicken curry is wonderful. My husband loved the mayo shrimp. The portions are large too. I loved the mango sorbet--delectable. And my daughter had the coconut sorbet, which is handmade on premises, and it was superb. Very clean, very friendly, and it's geographically desirable.  I'd like to add that I'm from the Detroit area. Really good Chinese there. When I moved here 16 years ago, the Chinese food disappointed me---THEY USED CELERY! Yuck. So now I judge places by that. Sesame Inn does not use celery, as far as I know."}
{"text":"Quick and simple Chinese food. Lunch combos include egg drop soup or salad, fried rice, egg roll and fried wonton for about about 10 bucks. My favorites are the Kung Pao Chicken, General Chu's Chicken, and I've heard great things about the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce. Get it with brown rice to save a few calories. I stay away from oriental dishes containing beef unless I know they're using high quality steak. That goes for any restaurant.   I believe they're family-owned and operated. The staff is always very nice and will chat with us if we have enough time. We're usually in a rush, so they expedite our lunches and we're in and out the door in less than 30 minutes. The prices may be on the high side, but you don't have many alternatives in the area aside from Pei Wei, and you'll pay the same there.  Great for take-out too!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab some Chinese grub in far north valley. Good service and reliably tasty cuisine."}
{"text":"The food we tried was VERY GOOD and VERY ABOVE AVERAGE and I am sure to return. This restaurant has five star potential.  I liked that they serve you complimentary hot tea with your meal.  The menu is somewhat assorted Asian and offers many Chinese Favorites, some not so common Chinese, some Thai and a few other Asian dishes. The pricing does run on the high side and portions that we had were small but the food we tried was VERY GOOD and was close to authentic style and this is a rare find!  I had the Spicy Chicken and Cucumber Salad. The moist tender white meat chicken was poached to perfection and the cucumbers were carefully deseeded and trimmed. They were in a tasty not too spicy gingery, garlicky sauce. This was a delicious refreshing light meal. It reminded me of a Chinese/Hawaiian dish I tried called Cold Ginger Chicken that this dish was very similar to.  My husband had the Szechuan Spicy Beef. The beef was very tender and had been twice cooked. This dish had some heat but wasn't as spicy as Szechuan. The sauce was close to  authentic style and lacked sweetness and the thick texture that your used too in Americanized Chinese Food. This dish was very good.  I was expecting just ok but was pleasantly surprised to find a very good restaurant that serves up very good Asian Food.  This place might be a gem!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai noodles, fried wontons and mayonnaise shrimp were excellent!  Fried rice, so-so.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from Sesame Inn.  Food was horrendous.  Lettuce tasted like it had dirt on it.  Frankly, the only thing edible was the egg roll.  Way too expensive for the bad food you get."}
{"text":"We live about 5 miles away and whenever I get the cravings for Ma Po Tofu, that's where we go. Their fried rice is very flavorful and satisfying all on its own (the entree, not part of lunch menu). I think their special dishes like cucumber soup, Ma Po Tofu are what sets them apart from other places. I've had their lunch specials and sure, I wasn't impressed and I would give them less stars had they been the only thing I've tried. Please give their cucumber soup a try! When a friend ordered it for us it sounded a bit unusual but shrimp was so succulent and tender plus the soup offered delicious mixture of sour and savory taste that will have you craving for it. So there you have it... My 3 favorite items! I will be back to try the mayo shrimp next time!"}
{"text":"Good basic Asian food. Dining room needs renovation as it's been 20 years since. No frills nothing fancy good takeout. Solid food."}
{"text":"Awful food and even worse food. Over priced garbage. The server was rude. Don't waist your time going there"}
{"text":"I placed an order to go last week of chicken lettuce wraps, pot stickers and Mongolian beef. The order was ready on time and I brought it back to our condo to eat. Unfortunately the pot stickers were cold and chewy. I then tried the lettuce wraps that is supposed to have chicken to put in  it but it looked like some sort of mystery meat instead. The taste was so bland that I wasn't sure what animal the meat came from. I was hoping that the Mongolian beef would save the dinner but unfortunately it had no taste and was as tough as shoe leather. I have come to the conclusion that since most Asian restaurants do not use MSG anymore to enhance the flavor that the items on their menu are no longer tasty or juicy anymore. I suggest skipping this place and go to PF Changs."}
{"text":"We are from California and everytime we stay at The Boulders (a hotel across the street) we come over for their delicious Chinese food.  The owner and her family are always happy to sit down and chit chat, and the food is consistently great.  We look forward to our next trip to The Boulders and The Sesame Inn."}
{"text":"The appetizers were good. Dinner was not even close to good.. far from good. Shockingly bad may be another way to put it.. The shock was the heavy contrast between the appetizers and the actual food. I honestly don't know how they managed it."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food! Would definitely recommend the sesame chicken and the calamari. Very delicious! Best calamari :) Great prices during lunch but gets a little pricey during dinner... Overall, great place if you're wanting Chinese food."}
{"text":"Good food but WAY WAY over priced. Small on portions, big on price! Nice staff, old worn out/tired decor. If I want to spend lots of money there are NICE and updated restaurants in Scottsdale to choose from. Being located in Cave Creek/Carefree does not give license to overcharge their patrons. Likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Crappy 1970s decor, food is decent but grossly overpriced. They don't put any fried noodles on the table...if you want them, they charge you $3.00 ..ridiculous ripoff!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and the service is always the best and the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Frankly, this is some of the priciest Chinese food I've ever had. Got takeout the other day for 3 adults. Spent nearly $75 and it simply wasn't worth it. Our order had 4 appetizers and 3 entrees.   There were supposed to be 4 potstickers but there were only 3. At $5.25, those 3 dumplings were pricey. Apparently somebody in the kitchen has trouble counting because our $4.50 order of crab puffs was also missing one (ie, it had 4 instead of 5). The Teriyaki beef skewers (you get 4 of them) were dry, dry dry. They were like eating beef jerky on a stick, only these were tasteless. They were tough and way overcooked or maybe they had just been sitting around for a few days. Definitely not worth $2 a piece.   The honey dipped ribs (4 of them) were a nice size but a little tough. The bbq sauce covering the ribs was tomato-based and I expected it to be a little sweet (it is called HONEY DIPPED ribs, after all) but it was pretty bland. I did not taste sweet on those ribs. The portion was a good size for an appetizer, though.   The Walnut Shrimp was probably the smallest portion of the entrees and way overpriced. I could count on 4 fingers the number of average size shrimp in there. They were stingy with the walnuts and veggies as well. The portion appeared to be child-sized or maybe a half portion but it was most definitely NOT worth almost $16.   The Beef and Broccoli was supposed to be prepared in a garlic brown sauce (according to the menu). The sauce had a light reddish tinge (maybe from some tomato sauce?) and there was no garlic flavor in this sauce. There was very little flavor of any kind. I expected to taste soy sauce, ginger, even pepper but nothing. I've had Beef and Broccoli at other restaurants before and I've also made it at home and this was the blandest by far. The broccoli was fresh and had a nice crunch and color to it and the beef was tender but cut into miniscule pieces, as if by cutting them so small and spreading them around, it'll look like you have a lot more beef than you actually do. At $13.50, the portion size was adequate for one person even though there seemed to be more broccoli and very little beef.   Finally, the House Fried Rice was the only dish that actually had some flavor to speak of. The aroma and color of the entree was appetizing. But, there was maybe 3 small shrimp, some chicken and pork and plenty of veggies. The portion was large so for almost $10 you get enough fried rice for maybe a couple of meals.   Additionally, I wasn't given (or offered) any packets of soy sauce (or any other sauce) or chopsticks. I suppose you just have to know to ask for what you want before you walk out. I also had to wait an additional 15 minutes longer than the \"20 to 30 minutes\" I was told it would take on the phone.   I wouldn't order takeout from this place again much less actually go and eat there. The food is overpriced, mediocre and flavorless. They're also stingy with their main ingredients, particularly the shrimp and beef. If you like overpaying for mediocre chinese food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This place is AWFUL. I'm sorry, there's just no nice way of saying it.   I picked up my food and while waiting for it, there was a man complaining about his meal and asking for his money back. This should have thwarted me but I ended up paying 30 dollars for this crappy food.   We order the sweet and sour chicken. The sauce has a strange flavor, unlike the traditional red sauce, this was orange and bland. Almost like jello. We also ordered the egg drop soup, which was very thick and had an odd taste to it, seemed old. And also ordered the crab puffs which were bland, room temp, and just tasteless.   Way too expensive, I paid 30 bucks for food we ended up just throwing away.   Do not recommend for those who love a good Chinese spot."}
{"text":"Staff was unaware of the difference between lo mein and chow mein...staff was very rude when I said the food was very salty. When I called the owner all she said was we are busy and that's how we do it and if I didn't like I shouldn't come back...I won't be back."}
{"text":"Still on a search to find good, authentic Chinese food in No. Scottsdale, we decided to give Sesame Inn a try.  Bottom line is ... we are still searching.  First clue that it wasn't going to go well ... no chopsticks on the table and we were never offered any.  Second clue ... after ordering, the waitress said, \"That comes with white rice.\"  To say that to a Chinese couple is like a slap in the face.  Of course it should come with white rice!  The food is edible, but I wouldn't rave about it .  I could make the same dishes at home for a fraction of the price. The previous review by Flippitti is right on.  It's certainly not worth the prices.  In fact, the size of the portions you are served make it a complete ripoff.  We had the chicken with string beans and the salt and pepper shrimp.  I am 5'1\" and 105 lbs. and could have eaten both orders by myself.  Needless to say, we left hungry and $36 poorer.  The salt and pepper shrimp is traditionally made with the shell still on and at some Chinese restaurants with the head on.  Their version (we assume to cater to American tastes) is made without the shells.  In order to accomplish this, they coat the shrimp with a dry, cardboard tasting flour mixture.  Then to disguise the fact that for $17, they are only serving you 8 small/medium size (not even large) shrimp, they pile them on top of a bed chopped green onions and cilantro.  By the way, the order of white rice that they so generously gave us with the entrees, was larger than the 2 entrees combined!  What was more amazing is that people kept coming in.  We couldn't understand it . Don't people get that they are paying out the nose for mediocre, pseudo Asian/Chinese food?  Would rather make the drive to Nee House in PV or even Chandler/Phoenix to get our Chinese food fix."}
{"text":"delicious, grubby, chinese food in generous portions and always great service.  their szchewaun chicken is THE BOMB. so spicy it makes me sweat."}
{"text":"There's a reason this place has been around so long. They have lots of offbeat options like mayonnaise shrimp, cucumber soup and a couple of interesting and legitimately spicy curries. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the hot and sour soup; good flavor, but way too viscous for me. The House Rice Noodles are a must!"}
{"text":"Favorite place ever! So many options to try new things and everything is so good! Would totally recommend coming here. The service is great and the food is even better. The almond chicken with white rice is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"This is a no-frills local Chinese joint reminscent of  \"A Christmas Story\" with a modern twist.  Come here for a cozy / nostalgic atmosphere with commendable comfort Chinese food and you won't be disappointed.  Come here for upscale or gourmet ethnic food and you'll leave let down.  Snowbirds from back East will feel right at home...."}
{"text":"This is the only good Chinese food in the area, solid service and a good atmosphere. This family owned business has been in business for years. We sit at the tiny bar area all the time for their fresh rolls and Thai dishes. Always good, great place. Must try."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and the food came quickly, so I have to be fair and give them praise for that.  Unfortunately we weren't very happy with how our food tasted.  Our Crab Rangoon, and Fried Rice were too salty.  Our Egg Rolls and Won Tons in our soup were bland.  The Thai Tofu dish was too dry, although the green beans and flavor of the sauce was good.  I don't think I'll return again.  I'll drive further down South to Flo's."}
{"text":"i do like their moo shu but it's only served with 2 pancakes.    most restaurants give 4.   their prices are a bit high.   lunch specials runs around $9.50.   other chinese restaurants are less.    their wonton soup is really good.  the sesame inn also needs to be cleaner.     there's dust all over the ceilings and hanging lights which is so bad i'm afraid it's going to fall in my food.       they're making a lot of money -- get someone in there to clean the place."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by one of the guys at our retreat, so we decided to try it. The food menu here is extensive and moderately priced ($10-$20)  This Chinese restaurant attempts to cover several other cuisines like Thai food. I ordered the Spicy Basil Tofu which was perfectly done. Not too spicy, but very flavorful and savory. Ambiance is very Asian with lots of oriental lanterns. Lots of reds and the space is great for large groups. It  was probably one of the best sit-down Chinese restaurants I have been to."}
{"text":"Time after time, I visit this little gem in the Carefree area, and find that the food is consistent - quantity and quality wise!  I continue to send family and friends to Sesame Inn when I hear they plan visit AZ.  Sure there isn't \"lo mein\" on the menu, but if you actually know your Chinese food like I do, you'll realize that this isn't a Cantonese style restaurant -- where lo mein is usually served.  I'm just sayin'..."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out.  I was so hoping the food was going to be good because I love chinese food and it is the closest to my home.  The spring rolls and cashew chicken were very average.  The wonton soup was a disaster...It was thick with mushy pieces of pastry with not one wonton to be found!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time the other night.  We were at a friends house up the street and decided to go have some dinner.  It was pretty late and close to closing time.  When we walked in we were greeted by the staff who was very friendly.  I really enjoyed having the tea at our table.  When our food arrived I was quite suprised.  It was great!  Decent portions and very deliscious.  I live in central Phoenix but I will make the drive to eat here again.  It was a little pricey but the quailty of the food was worth it.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Our favorite local Asian style food!  We have huge battles over the leftover Chow Mai Gun/ Singapore noodles.  Not cheap but a good value at lunch.   No delivery :("}
{"text":"This is really solid Americanized Chinese food. I live just about a mile away, so we get take-out every now and then. I honestly believe the low reviews are because of the fairly high prices. I do wish they would lower their prices--we would get take-out more frequently if they did because their food is good. Our last take-out order, we got the moo-shu pork, shrimp with vegetables, house fried rice, and one egg roll. Our total with tax was $40 (as for the reviewer who ordered for four and their total was $110 - they must have ordered a crazy ton of food. My family doesn't eat like pigs). This fed my family of four for dinner, and I had enough leftover for my lunch the next day (a big lunch too. I was stuffed).   Quantities are not always very big. I love moo-shu pork, but they give you very little for $10. If you eat it in the restaurant, they roll it into only two pancakes and serve it like that. If you empty those two pancakes, it amounts to very little, but it's still very tasty. I also like to take my daughter here so we can sip tea while we wait for our meal. The ambiance is lovely.  Anyhow, if you need a Chinese fix, this is a good place, but be prepared to spend more than you would at your typical cheap Chinese place. The food is good, though, the decor charming, and the service friendly."}
{"text":"Came through this place because someone in my party was a big fan of shrimp with lobster sauce and this was the closest location to procure some.  The atmosphere inside is a little odd.  It felt a little old and empty, and I kind of had the sensation I was at my late grandmother's house.  Service was amazing, but that was to be expected as there were very few others in the restaurant, so we had seemingly three servers to ourselves.  For starters we had spring rolls and won ton soup.  Both were very tasty - the sweet and sour sauce paired very well with the spring roll.  I wish you got more than two!  For my main course I got the orange chicken.  I have to say I was a little disappointed by the spice level.  It is called out on their menu with a 'warning' red pepper, but there was almost no spice in it at all.  While I would prefer to err on the side of less spice over more, they went way overboard in this instance, and it really just tasted like plain chicken.  Since the service was so great, I'm going to give this place the benefit of the doubt.  If you're in the mood for some Americanized Chinese cuisine give this place a look, you could do worse."}
{"text":"Just had a late dinner here. The food was delicious and the service was great and very polite! I had the teriyaki chicken and the flavors were right on point! Great place to go! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Az! It's not too greasy, too salty, and has the perfect amount of flavor.. AND I don't feel like sh*t after. My favorite dish is the pad thai and kung pao chicken. Their broccoli beef is another one of my favorites. The portion sizes here are perfect and it's moderately priced.. Worth EVERY penny. It's nice because you can order it to go or eat there. The service is great and the servers are very friendly. I highly recommend trying Sesame Inn!"}
{"text":"All I can say is the Pad Thai and Chicken Satay are awesome here. Although Sesame is a Chinese restaurant they sure know how to put together some great Thai dishes. I would also strongly recommend the veggie spring rolls as well as the beef and broccoli."}
{"text":"We found our special occasion Chinese food place in our new neighborhood! Friendly and informative staff and GREAT food. The Alcohol drinks were a bit marginal, but we found out it was the waitress that makes them, so next time we will just skip it or stick with something easy!  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Like how they give you tea when sitting down to eat here. Love the bowls that the rice comes in and love how there is a lot of rice for the entrees here. The miso soup is very good and I definitely recommend getting it. I got the chicken with string beans and it remind me of the meal similar to that at P.F. Changs, very delicious and everyone should try it!"}
{"text":"My crew and I eat lunch here all time. The decor is a little dated, but the food and service are great. The lights hanging from the ceiling crack me up"}
{"text":"I haven't had chinese food in a while and don't know why I would bother coming up this far north to get it.  I got the lunch special which is way more expensive than other places and the food was 'meh'.  For Chinese food I would go anywhere else.    They lose 3 stars for mediocre food and high price tag to go along with it.  i do have to say, they have very nice service and the fortune cookies were surprisingly fresh."}
{"text":"It appears that people either love this restaurant or not. If you are use to Americanized Chinese food, you may not like this place. You have to have an open mind and palette and be willing to try something new. The style of cooking is Thai and Asian. The dishes are named the same but not the same as we have been accustomed to. These dishes have more vegetables and especially onions. I embraced the change and the flavors. I felt that the portions were huge and am happy to have another meal or two from the excess. It's worth a try if you are an adventurist."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped for take-out.  The first thing I notice is all the debris on the entry carpet.  The menu is set up so each dish (like orange chicken or sweet and sour pork) is served as a \"meal\" which specifically means they come with just rice. $40.00 later we walked out with 3 choices and enough rice to feed the all my neighbors, oh yes and 3 fortune cookies.  And unfortunately the food did not not taste good. It wasn't fresh (the Veges were transparent and limp) and the food was flavorless. Also, I felt like I was painfully dragging answers to my menu questions out of the employee."}
{"text":"Pricey for what you're getting, and though it's Carefree/N.Scottsdale area, it just doesn't quite justify it.  Food isn't bad, but not great either.  Inauthentic mixture of several asian cuisines here too.  Parking is good though."}
{"text":"As far as Chinese restaurants go, this one is a sure thing.  Lots of parking in a pretty quiet strip mall.  Staff is friendly and they even have some Thai options.  I have gone a few times a year for many years and the food is always enjoyable.  They are pretty conservative with their spice, even the dishes that are marked spicy are pretty tame, but the taste is still very good.  The potstickers, orange peel chicken, lemon chicken, and kung pao anything are our favorites. I always appreciate when the waitress gives suggestions about dishes or the quantity of food ordered and I find they are very honest with their suggestions-they are not just trying to get you to order more.  Moderate prices for this area. Three of us ate for $60."}
{"text":"Alright so my friend Ashley L. wanted to go here so the first thing I did was look at the reviews on Yelp.  Mostly good but a few bad ones.  I have to say that usually only read the really bad reviews so I can get a feel for what may be wrong.  I was especially interested in the ones that said the sesame chicken was not good since Ashley L. said that was her favorite.   So I went and decided to let her lead.  They bring out the hot jasmine tea to poor into these little cups.  I must say that on a cold (well Arizona cold) day this was fantastic.  It was full of flavor and a nice start to the meal.  We both ordered the sesame chicken lunch combo and boy was I in for a treat.   We started with egg drop soup.  This is not my normal favorite as I do not like tofu and it is usually unpleasant if I get a bite.  It is mostly the texture I don't like but the tofu was smooth and tasted like the broth and so I ate the whole bowl.  Then out came the lunch.  I was not expecting this much food.  I can see why some people were put off by the sesame chicken as it is not prepared the way it is everywhere else.  It felt so much lighter and had more flavor than I could imagine.  It was a piece of breaded chicken with a light sauce and green onions over it.  It was excellent.  Ashley L. is not a fan of chicken but loves this chicken and I can see why.  It was perfectly prepared with no fat globs anywhere.  It was moist and cooked to perfection.  This came with fried rice on the side.  The rice was well cooked with nice crunchy vegetables mixed in.  There were to fried wontons that were perfectly done and not too oily.  I don't like fried wontons usually because they make the mouth feel like is has been greased yuck.  These did not have that horrible side effect.  The egg roll was perfectly crisp without any of the guminess that can occur if not cooked properly.  Fresh delicious vegetable inside.   Now to the service.  I don't know who our waiter was exactly because it felt like everyone was waiting on us.  It wasn't terribly busy but there was great teamwork.  Our tea never ran out no matter how fast we drank it they always filled it before we could finish it.  Our water glasses always had fresh water and ice and our plates were cleared promptly.  It was almost eerie how things would appear and disappear while we talked.  We never felt rushed to leave and even after the check was on the table we were checked on frequently.   The price for both of us was $19 and was well worth the food and the service that we received. I can't wait to become a regular here."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Sesame Inn for more than 15 years, starting when there were down at Thunderbird and Scottsdale Rd.  I've even had the same waitress, Grace, all that time.  This is the only place I know of that makes Kung Pao Beef by deep frying the beef first.  It's unique and without peer.  Everything else is good as well, from the soups to the Mu Shu Pork to the House Special Chicken."}
{"text":"I do not take writing poor reviews lightly, but this was an absolute disaster. Ordered takeout. Sesame Chicken and Thai Chicken Curry.  You would think with a place called SESAME Inn the Sesame Chicken would be delicious. It was inedible. It was a DRY (NO SAUCE- and I mean NONE) breast of chicken sliced into strips with about 10 sesame seeds on it. We live about 35 mins round trip....I call the restaurant and try to explain. Put on hold for OVER 6 minutes finally hang up call back. No apologies. NOTHING. Have to drive ALL the way back to get something else. Again. No apology or any type of compensation. Any goodwill gesture would have been appreciate as I have eaten Sesame Chicken at dozens of restaurants and never has it looked like Dry Sawdust chicken fingers.  This was a complete fail. We will not be back."}
