{"text":"I brought my colleagues over for some drinks followed by dinner and we all are blown away at the high level of service from the restaurant staff ! Every little detail was attended to.  We will definately be going back often !"}
{"text":"Decor: The venue is lovely - it's true to its art deco roots and the 30's / 40's timeframe. The details are noticeable and include an incredible audio and projection system that blends in to the overall décor. I'm told the goal was to bring back old Hollywood glamour that existed during the first Oscars in 1929 and I think they have done this successfully with the décor. The possibility for music and theatrics (entertainment) during dinner and afterwards just keeps you brainstorming all night. The old-fashioned black and white films playing everywhere (including in the bathroom) could easily be hi-jacked for event-specific, company-specific visuals and I think they'll be doing more with them in the foreseeable future. It's intimate and comfortable and different enough.  Staff:  The staff is completely charming. The bartender remembered my name in a restaurant of 120 and even the coat check girls were absolutely delightful. I often find service makes an event and I think we would be on solid ground in this respect.  Food: My boyfriend described his meal as 'something mom would make, only better'. It's Sunday dinner on Wednesday. Trevor is advertised as an haute cuisine chef, who prepares food in the French traditions, with an urban, modern flare. I would also like to add he appears to specialize in comfort food prevalent in the era in which he is now absorbed. So, although you may order roast beef with Yorkshire pudding, French onion soup or Caesar salad, each dish is well placed and either reinvented, or deconstructed. The wine choice, although not what I would call a 'drinkable' wine on its own (the kind you find yourself at the bottom of far too quickly), the dryness matched well with the full flavoured entrees and was well chosen on our behalf.  However, although the food is good , I was not \"blown away\" in the way that we want to impress on Tuesday night. The French onion soup was on the salty side and should have required more spoon (the consistency was quite thick versus soupy). The Caesar salad (often bland in many restaurants) appeared unassuming, but the beautiful ingredients combined together with each bit to create more complex flavours than you expected. And I still can't figure out if it was anise I was tasting in my seafood fettuccine... whatever it was, it was a bit strange and I wasn't digging it. Our apple turnover for dessert was perfectly looked, although slightly unimpressive. The caramel sauce was just burnt enough and thick enough to stay on your fork, redeeming it.  All in all, Trevor's menu is homemade, but better. Food is maybe a 2.5/5 and not up to his standards in my opinion, but the service puts my review at a solid 4/5.   Screams Wednesday dinner with the in-laws."}
{"text":"no stars for the unco-operative and inconsistant security.. half the group on the guest list got in before eleven half the group didn't at 11:03 we were asked to pay cover.  frustrated by this we talked to a few people at the door and security. all i heard was no.   talk about being inflexible.   we leaving the club the head of security noticed this we explained the situation.. we were all let in.   despite being let in. this made for a sour experience to start off the night. we were hosting our out of town guest.  my take is that the first security guard didn't want to embarass himself  so everyone went along with whatever he said. until things got overun by his boss (head of security)  you're going to attempt to nickel and dime us for cover for 2-3 minutes when half our group was in for free plus we're going to spend 9+ dollars per drinks during the night to entertain?! this treatment was unreal.   music for Fri I would describe as dance/techno/with some abrupt and strange transitions .. not my thing and imho didn't flow at all. things didn't pick up until 12am..  the club was intentionally holding back people in line from getting in. as inside the club was empty.  the club was full of douche bags. had to punk one off of my friends. who just goes up and starts grinding someone they didn't make convo or eyecontact with? wtf    another guy nearby smacked a lady arm and her wine glass went flying and crashing down to the floor. the guy was flat out oblivious and didn't acknowledge or pay for the lady's drink.  at the main bar  the bartender is slow, he was struggling to make some jaggerbombs.. he literally took 5 mins to try to create some artful creation with 3 glasses.. for what? the shots were spilling into the drink. the customer was too drunk to notice this slop job. go practice at home.   overpriced, over iced drinks with prick security. i was expecting  a lot more.  appears the 19 crowd grew up a bit and landed. there was no swank or anything I found special here."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, despite the media buzz and novel décor, the food at the Roosevelt Room - dubbed \"Toronto's newest supper club\" by the media - most closely resembles an overpriced, touristy restaurant on the Champs-Élysées. The dishes that my dining partner and I tried --  coq au vin, French onion soup, charcuterie platter, among others - tasted generally bland, uninspired and generic. Again, I'm basing my opinion on the higher than normal prices that the RR charges. At this price point ($25-$40 for a main) one should expect a level of quality at least close to par with the rest of this city's offerings.   Now, this restaurant opened a week and a half ago, so I am inclined to say it is still a work in progress, and surely the menu will be revised and refined. Until that point, I would suggest waiting at least a month before you venture in for the food. In the meantime, if you want French - real French - look elsewhere (Didier, Papillon, Le Select Bistro, etc).  PROS: Novel décor, friendly and attentive front staff  CONS: Menu lacks character, refinement, and value; does not stand up to the competition  FINAL WORD: Come here to see and be seen, but not for the food."}
{"text":"My third time here & I still love it.  Although, we get VIP treatment so maybe the experience is a tad bias. Luckily, i'm a realist and not so easily phased.   drinks: Moi trademark poison ; Soho Lychee & Ginger Ale ^_^  we got a $400 bottle of red Pinot, which was not that great. Thick body and too much on the dry side. DO NOT GO FOR WINE HERE!!!!!!   The dinner was DELICIOUS!.  apps: yam fries with a curry mustard dip (REALLY good)   mac/cheese creamy macaroni (I wasn't a big fan - only because, If I was going to be bad, then I could do it with something bad-er than mac/cheese)  spinach salad with basamic vineger, cucumbers and carrot shreds. - not bad.  Dinner: Roasted chkn, mash potatoes steak served with green beans & carrots. - AMAZING. The green beans were to DIE for. I actually ordered 3 servings of it. No lie. they were tender and buttery, without the oily feel and the carrots were juicy but cooked so perfectly soft.   Desert: I dont think these were on the menu but we had an array of high end cupcakes. My favorites were  the lime and cinnamon orange & red velvet with cheesecake icing vanilla & coconut - soooooooo yum  The decor is changed just a bit but its relatively the same, small, loungy atmosphere for an older crowd. The music , on the Friday , was more progressive trance which was a bit of a downer.   Its a great place for a birthday party/ in my case, a masquerade birthday party. HA!. I recommend booking ahead of time for dinner and try and do a good follow up to build a good relationship. The next time you come in, they will remember you by name and always offer a flawless service.   M."}
{"text":"I attended the media preview for this spot last night, mostly because I am a fan of chef Trever Wilkinson and have always enjoyed his restaurants.   Also, it was open bar.   This supper club is beautifully designed, all art deco with the exception of a poorly chosen ceiling over the dance floor which resembles a bowling alley - flashing coloured lights in line formations, inlaid in shiny metal panels.   The menu was a tasting inspired by the original menu served at the first ever Academy Awards ceremony in 1929. I recall french onion soup, bacon burger sliders, foie gras toasts, shrimps with a spicy marmalade, tartar tacos, some kind of tuna tartar potato skin. There were a variety of capable fritters, cookies, and profiteroles for desert.   The mixologist apprentice from BarChef was on hand to create their signature molecular cocktails. At 20-30 dollars a piece on the menu, I was more then willing to wait the 20 minutes it took to queue up for one (or three, who am I kidding?) - between myself and my date we tried the sidecar, beefeater fizz, and two versions of a champagne cocktail (one with concord pearls, one with a cinnamon foam). While they look amazing, I prefer my gin without eggwhite foam, and I found the straight up martinis much more appealing.  While I have never actually gone to a club in the entertainment district before, this space felt like one I could be dragged to again. Its size though indicates it will be a tough spot to get into - I counted maybe 7 banquettes in the main area - although I am quite sure the dining area is still unfinished or simply wasn't open for the preview.   Clubland with class and a great chef. I'm impressed, but it might just be my hangover talking."}
{"text":"I went here for my 25th birthday celebration with a bunch of my girlfriends.  So much fun!  We had guest list and waited outside for a little bit but not long.  When we entered they were still collapsing the tables from the dinner so we had some drinks.  The music was GREAT - it was a Saturday night and I really enjoyed the mixes from dirty hip hop to house and old school dance.  The best music I've experienced at a club since I was in Miami.   There were 3 things that were negative for me.  Firstly, the guys at this place were really young and immature.  Thankfully I was with a large group of friends and we were able to deflect any unwelcome attention.  Second, the music was REALLY loud.  Maybe 25 means I'm heading to seniors land but I had ringing in my ears until the next day.  Finally, it was really hot.  Hotter than any club I have gone to.  It was so hot that we finally left because we felt so overheated.  Overall I still had tons of fun and would definitely come back on a Friday or Saturday night and I think things like dropping the music volume a notch and investing in some more AC would be easy fixes that would bump me up to a 4 star review."}
{"text":"Douchebag central. If you like girls with faux tans, or guys with faux tans, then this is your place. I think this is where all the rejects from \"Lake Shore\" come to show off their new fake boobs and dental veneers. The bouncers are a-holes, even if you're dressed well and doing bottle service. If you are looking for a place to book a table and order bottles with your friends, try Cheval or The Drake (or anywhere else but RR for that matter!). Pretentious. Shallow. Rude."}
{"text":"Festivus 2010, Christmas party, great environment and friendly bartenders. Delicious finger food for the starved and drinks were great. Open environment to meet new people, I would recommend to go again."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the food at this place; this review is for the Friday night club night I attended.   The layout of the club is nice. The servers are very nice. Prices of drinks are lower than expected for a bustling club in the Douche District. But everything else... oh, god. Cheeseball city deluxe. Libations are your garden variety club fare, juices are canned. Music is ridiculously loud. Terrible house music... aaaaand some guy playing bongos to accompany the music. (Seriously? Is this 2003?) I'm an old club/rave rat and I can't remember music ever being that loud. Have people gotten deafer in the last 10 years?   Anyway.  Clientele: The night I went, there were more women then men. Lots of future trophy wives, squealing bachelorettes, and some that you probably pay by the hour. Lots of female eye candy, if that's what you're looking for. As for the men, think guys wearing thick chains around their necks, gelled hair, and sporting large \"diamond\" earrings.   I may be a little bit biased/curmudgeony as it's not my scene; I came here because my b-school held an end-of-quarter event here. But I just couldn't take it and slipped out the door after half an hour and three weak drinks. With that said, if you're a lady who digs Tiesto and want to catch the kind of man who wears chains around his neck, loves Ed Hardy, bathes in Davidoff Cool Water, and GTLs on his weekends when he's not trying to scramble up the corporate ladder, then this place is for you. Guys, if you can bear the awful music but want to gawk at some pretty hot women, then by all means - visit the Roosevelt Room."}
{"text":"Pretty much 3 stars. I won't return to double-check though.  I do get why my company chose to have it's holiday party there. Some of the art deco design features are quite beautiful - the bar in the front room, and the swooping silver stripes on the ceiling in that room and the third room made me feel like I was in the Chrysler Building*  But a holiday party does not run on decor, even if you're a decorator, which none of us are. No, a holiday party runs first and foremost on booze, followed by food. The booze was flowing, and they didn't stint on the variety. Martinis are the thing at the Roosevelt Room, as they are trying to transport you back to a finer day, when men were men and women were dames, and no one worried about getting behind the wheel after a night of boozing. Since this was a holiday party in downtown Toronto and we all had taxi chits, we weren't worried either. I did have one pomegranate martini and it tasted of sugar. I also had a few vodka sodas which tasted of soda. Hmmm.... not so much with the stiff drinks at the Roosevelt Room. To be kind, the bartenders were working their asses off and were very quick with the drinks. Much appreciated.  So, then how did they perform in the food department? Not so well there either, I am sorry to report. Everything I touched had a layer of grease on it, and tasted like it. Everything they offered was either fried or greasy. So I guess they are duplicating the old days too, before fresh foods were readily available and people cared about eating healthy.**  The duck was fatty, the french fries had an undiscernable but weird aftertaste, the shrimp was greasy, I could go on, but I stopped trying the food at that point.  Positives: Excellent dj playing hits from today like Lady Gaga*** and from yesterday like MJ. No, they didn't play any jazz tunes from the 1920s.The art deco only goes so far The bathrooms are also very cool. Individual stalls with sinks. Mostly kept very clean, although at one point (maybe around 9pm) I hit upon a stall with no toilet paper or paper towels.  Convenient location in the entertainment district. On a street called Drummond which is basically an alley off Adelaide just east of Peter.  I have no idea how much this party cost or how much martinis or food cost. I do know that once the open bar closed and I bought a Corona, it was about $6 which isn't bad.  If you want to partake in some old-school glamour, I know The Roosevelt Room is positioning itself that way, but they are time travelling too much**** and missed the mark.  * and I know! I used to work there **Hmm..wasn't that the 70s? Not the 1920s? ***two reviews in one week with a Lady Gaga reference. do I spot a trend? **** like in The Time Travellers Wife"}
{"text":"This review is strictly regarding the club....I was swayed and eager to go since they brand themselves as old Hollywood glamour, with their Art Deco decor.....  When we arrived Friday night, I was surprised that despite being on the guest list, we were still asked to make the line, and wait.  Being on the guest list means bypassing the list!  But, no problem, it wasn't long.  Once inside and after buying our drinks, my girlfriend and I looked at one another quizzically because there were a lot of young people there! And their attitude and rudeness came through with every minute that passed.  By the way, the drinks came to $15 (overpriced drinks at any club, and nothing special).  The guys were pretty cheesy. And rude. While on the dance floor, one guy deliberately bent over and pushed me with his bumm!  He thought he was hilarious and when I turned around to find out what was happening, he and his friends were laughing and running away. Running away like little, cowardly girls. What is this this? High school? Although, with the crowd present, I would not be surprised that it indeed was a high school grad party!  Another fine specimen of the cheesy type pushed past my girlfriend as he was chugging his red bull.   And yet another example: one guy screamed \"excuse me\", as he made what he probably thought was a funny face, as he and his new found female friend passed by us. his rush, to lean against the wall and having the girl grind against him. And finger her when he had the chance.  The women, excuse me, the girls were just as bad!  Wearing trashy, cheap dresses you can probably get at Sirens (there were exceptions, and they kept their composure). They were wearing high heels, slipping on the dance floor, drinking beer and waving it wildly.  But the thing that turned us off and made us walk out was the blatant, overt, drunken sexual simulation:  A girl started riding a guy, she had her legs round him and we could see her bikini panty! It gets worse. Her dress top was dishevelled and had fallen off. Yes, her bra was showing. She was too drunk to noticed.  At that point, we left.   You go to a club to dance and laugh and have a good time. We love house music, we love club music, we love to dance. In fact, the music was good.  What we don't love is rude attitude and being deliberately bullied (bumm pushing) and the sexual behaviour displayed for all to see. Those girls certainly do not have any self-respect or self-esteem...They seemed and acted like under aged girls.  I am certain the Roosevelt Room is not glamorous nor sophisticated. I am equally certain I will never return there."}
{"text":"Completely agree with Brent C. here - for the price you pay, the RR should serve up much better fare.  I went here for Summerlicious and it was not a 'good deal', even at Summerlicious prices! The risotto I had was indeed good, but it was literally two spoons worth, and the steak was an obviously very poor quality meat. Frankly, it was chewy. Not a good thing.  I found the service also terrible, with the exception of the front-of-staff. Multiple times waiters came by with food we had not ordered - even not courses we had ordered!   All in all, much over-hyped. I also was not impressed by the decor, a supposed selling point for the place, which looked kind of cheap."}
{"text":"Still not a massive fan  GUESTLIST So we went for a friend's bday party and they didn't have us on the guestlist even though we had a confirmation. They kept saying that our name is probably on the other list they have (why don't all the ppl serving the guestlist have the same list?).  But they never went to check their colleagues' list.   Although after much discussion, they said they trusted us and would be willing to let us in.  We also showed them the confirmation on our phone after this discussion (it took us a while to find it).   MUSIC bah! They repeated the songs over again through the night. I didn't like that.  They brought back alot of old music (motown area, old pop songs). If you're into that, then it was great.  CROWD Much older crowd. I would say both the men and women were in their late 30's, 40's and 50's.  Everyone was there to have a great time but for some reason there was much more shoving than usual. I don't understand why.  I'm still not a fan of this place but if you go with a good group of friends, it's ok."}
{"text":"I went here a few weekends ago with some friends. We didn't eat there, so I can't comment on the food. I'm merely reviewing the club.   I was immediately displeased by how uncoordinated the guest list line was upon our arrival. I was under the impression that putting yourself on a guest list was supposed to make your entrance into the club more streamlined. This was not the case. When we lined up, we were instructed to leave the line and go find the person with the clipboard. When we did that, we were scolded for trying to talk to the \"bearer of the clipboard\" outside of the lineup! When we reentered the line we had to go all the way to the back of the line (in the pouring rain might I add!).   Being on the guest list meant that we got 1/2 off the insanely overpriced cover charge of $20. Forking over that $10 didn't exactly make me feel privileged.   The crowd that evening was an interesting mix that made for an entertaining evening. I was happy that there weren't too many young'uns!   I really enjoyed the music, the DJ was excellent! HOWEVER, it was WAY too loud. We're talking painfully, eardrum shatteringly LOUD! I realize that this a geriatric complaint, but everyone I was with agreed that their ears were ringing well into the next day. I don't know about you, but I would like to possess the gift of hearing for years to come...and if I keep going to this place? That ain't gonna happen."}
{"text":"3.5 stars The roosevelt room was A-ok as a Toronto lounge... The ambiance and crowd is much better than the other clubs in the vicinity of the Richmond stretch and I liked the fact that it did not get overpacked. The bouncers are less fussy than usual and the line moves smoothly enough on a Friday night. Drinks are the average price and strength for the club scene, and the music is alright but a bit all over the place (a little too much mixing between random genres!)  Overall worth a try if you feel like clubbing and insist on sticking to the classic club district"}
