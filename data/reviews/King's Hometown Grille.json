{"text":"Meh, foods not bad for what this place is. Nothing exceptional to write about. Was here for work without a rental car so this was really my only option for hot food. First time here, I waited quite awhile before a server came by. Was a Saturday at 5:30 so it wasn't terribly busy. Second time here was the opposite to the point I felt like I was being rushed. The waitress came mid-meal to ask me if i wanted dessert or anything else. She came a second time not 5 min later to take my plate while I was still eating. I ordered dessert which she brought immediately with my check. Was otherwise friendly though."}
{"text":"The food is okay and I thought the service was good. I normally have breakfast here rather than fight the crowd for the free breakfast at the hotel I stay at next door.   The restaurant is clean and well taken care of.   So I Will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We came for milkshakes and food. When we started ordering the waitress told us not to order milkshakes because she didn't want to make them. The food took an hour to get and there was no one in the place. Food was meh. Milkshakes were more like flavored milk. The check took forever to get. Oh, and check out their wall where they misspelled flour. Haha!"}
{"text":"This is close to the workplace and where co-workers go out to lunch together.  The staff is always friendly and we've never had an issue with our orders.  Prices are reasonable and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Food is fine... not much different than 100 other chains of this type.  Staff members are very friendly, prices are good.  Location is outstanding for people traveling on I-79."}
{"text":"Hey, people, it's a diner! For fancy-schmancy places you have Pittsburgh 3 miles away. This one is for dining out with friend or family: close by, home style food, tasty, fresh and inexpensive. No dishes with asparagus, yes, but dozen good entrees under $10. Meat and liver are good, crab cakes - not that much."}
{"text":"What a horrible place. I ordered an egg white omelette and it seems as the cook didn't like me ordering that. It barely contained the contents of one egg. Service was so so and the table and sitting area were dirty. HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What an unfortunate dining experience. Went for a Sunday lunch today with my family and  my 2 toddlers. The restaurant was not crowded and we were seated right away.  We ordered fairly quickly and I asked for the baby's food to come out as soon as possible. Close to 20 minutes later we got our drinks. Another 20 min after that we started to look around for our server to ask about the food. We found her and she defensively announced that there was a 20 top ahead of us and there is nothing she can do. Another 10 min after that we asked for the kids food ( they had been waiting 50 minutes at that point). Kid food came out (we had no silverware though and had to ask for it) and we were told our food was on its way. 20 min after that still no food. Finally after about an hour and 15 minutes we got 5 out of the 7 meals delivered. They were cold. We tried to wait for the other 2 meals and we waited and waited and waited. Eventually we just asked for the check and the other meals in a box. The server was rude and not at all apologetic. She just kept saying it wasn't her fault. She however never checked on us, never asked if we wanted refills on drinks and never communicated with us what was going in until we hunted her down. The manager came out and comped our check with an apology but 2 people at the table never even got their food. Epic fail! Really poor service. :("}
{"text":"One word sums this place up....\"Pathetic\".  I don't know how it stays in business with the poor food and horrible service.  This rating is not based on one experience...been at this place three times.  This review is based on my latest dining experience and is the last time I eat at this place.  Figured I'd give it a go for breakfast again....ordered the eggs benedict with a side of bacon.  Had the sauce for the Benedict come one the side cause I had my doubts it would be any good...I was right.  The English muffin wasn't toasted, the ham was salty lunch meat, the eggs were OK...was edible so finished it.  Now for the sides...the potatoes were extremely under cooked and too firm to eat...ate the smaller pieces which were cooked.  Now for the bacon...nothing worse than slimy, greasy, dripping fat, undercooked bacon...how freaking hard is it to make bacon and cook breakfast potatoes?  For this place apparently a very difficult task.  I should have sent the breakfast back...but didn't want to go through the bull crap because the girl waiting on me I had once before and she has such an attitude I didn't want to deal with it."}
{"text":"I think the food was good home Cooking. I had Cinnamon swirl bread , french toast that was really good. My eggs were scrambled soft and very tasty. I had sausage links that were cooked Perfectly! This was Diner food at Diner prices. Husband got a meat lovers Skillet meal , which he said was a little scorched but overall not bad, The whole meal Cost us $25 with 2 sweet teas."}
{"text":"I was shocked to see this place only received 2 stars, until I went there last night. They may have just been bad at placing a food order for the kitchen, but when your out of almost every thing I order, that's a problem. Let alone we had a waiter that talked your ear off and wouldn't let us look at the menu in peace, instead he decides to read the whole thing to us. Then after not having 3 of the things I tried ordering, our food took over a hour to come out. Now, I could understand if they were busy, but they were dead! My boyfriend and I got the steak and eggs, mine was MR, and his was M. Over all it shouldn't take a hour to cook that, especially when our scrambled eggs came out under cooked and runny!"}
{"text":"This place sucks, I ordered eggs and I've been here an hour. All new people, no cook. Go someplace else!"}
