{"text":"I come here and sit at the bar about once a week for lunch. The sushi is always fresh and the wait staff is always kind. I never have to wait long for my meal to arrive. Great location and great sushi!"}
{"text":"We visited this place tonight and it was really good, fresh sushi.  The decor was very contemporary and tasteful.  Even a TV on the wall in case you're not really into your date.    We ordered the Rainbow roll, Spicy Tuna Crunch, Yellowfin, and Spicy Octopus which were all really good.    The Rainbow roll had 3 different fish and avocado and it was fresh, even the avocado.    The Spicy Tuna Crunch and Spicy Octopus were my favorites of the night.  The Spicy Tuna Crunch had perfect flavors and hit the spot with a little wasabi.  Our waiter suggested having the Spicy Octopus as a hand roll, but the maki was pretty good. Maybe next time.  After having been to House of Hunan, Big Eye Sushi is a better overall experience and makes me reminisce of East Coast sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the area.  Went here the weekend after Thanksgiving with my parents, who have been regulars since they opened.  We are from Philly, and BigEye is on par with the best sushi in Philly.   Pop had the sashimi deluxe combo, which had a phenomenal assortment of fresh cuts of fish in a nice presentation.  The white tuna was incredibly fresh and buttery. We ordered a bunch of rolls for the table, including the Mustard Roll, Dragon roll, and various spicy rolls.   The Mustard Roll was fantastic (my new fave there), as was the Dragon Roll.  The various spicy rolls were decent.   Finished dinner off with the mango ice cream, which was creamy but not too rich...a nice palette cleanser.  Kim and Barry, the owners, are very welcoming and friendly.  Would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"The atmosphere there is great, really inviting and comfortable. The staff we interacted with were super nice, funny, and helpful with everything. The sushi was absolutely amazing, cannot say a bad thing about any of the sushi at all. The sake was amazing and the right temperature, and the sangria special was amazing. A great appetizers I had was the crab poofs, delicious. My friends and I sat at the sushi bar which was a great experience! Definitely going back!!!!"}
{"text":"A quiet little sushi place in a strip mall, which is usually good indication. As is the case with this place. The best sushi I've ever had, no.but it is good. Haven't had Any of the service problems the other reviewers mention. I've been there at least half a dozen times. I will continue to come back.we are pretty finicky sushi people, and for us to keep coming back to this place is a big positive."}
{"text":"I am no major food critic. But maaaaaaaaaaaan lemme tell you.  The vibe given here was very relaxing. And our server was immediately attentive. We started out with a sashimi appetizer. Followed by a noodle dish. It's a good way to escape other crowded sushi places and the vibe allows for conversation. You don't have to have high standards to enjoy a delicacy of a meal. If I knew I was going to die, I'd come here and stuff myself with sushi in hopes of getting Mercury poison then go rent a Ferrari and drive if off into the ocean to be with more sushi."}
{"text":"I usually have really good service when I go. I think it's a pretty good deal when you go during happy hour.  My favorite rolls are the super crunch and spicy scallop.  The extra mayo was free in the past but the last time I went we were charged. Not a huge deal.  The fish is pretty fresh and never had a roll I didn't like."}
{"text":"Good, not great. The sushi was flavorful and fresh, but it didn't really wow me like good sushi should. Nice for a casual sushi shop."}
{"text":"We came for a late lunch. The cooked food was very good.  We had noodle dishes and a curry.  The sauces and seasonings were not heavy or too spicy.  They have a selection of traditional sushi as well as as some inventive maki rolls.  The sushi tasted fresh and were larger than average.  By the time we finished, it was happy hour and the place was packed."}
{"text":"Good service, decent sushi, tho it's kind of expensive outside of happy hour..."}
{"text":"We work right down the road. We like the sushi , however the \"salad & soup\" that come with the lunch boxes are a complete joke. I would do one or the other--- or not at all. The bowl has only 1/4 amount of soup in it as so does the salad. Like... You're really embarrassing yourself in my opinion. Come on--- miso soup is cheap cheap cheap!!!! So is bagged salad.  It's comical.  We order to go and I always tip the server. Never have gotten a thank you--- so I'm going to stop. They aren't very friendly there either--- the ppl behind the bar preparing the sushi, I mean.  I dunno....... Some ppl care about customer service. I guess it's just embedded into me.  I only order here for a last resort for these reasons.  And yes. They are expensive.  This is my review. Take it how you want it.  :))"}
{"text":"I have to stand up for Big Eye.  I've been there three times and each time had a very pleasant experience, attentive staff, great food.  Downside:  no liquor license.    Again, it's in a strip mall.  Behind a Rite Aid.  It's just weird to me.  Why won't AK build stand alone buildings?  And why must all sushi be available in strip malls?"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi in Akron! We ordered the Love Boat and asked the chef to surprise us. Loved our dinner! Every piece was terrific...my ONLY complaint was that the rolls are too large and were hard to eat in one bite! Flavors were terrific, just wish the rolls were about half the size!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite Sushi places in the Akron area. Great sushi and drinks.   We started with the Harvest Sangria which is a Sangria made with sake and plum wine.   Excellent summer drink.  We then had seaweed salad and the pepper tuna appetizer.   Both prepared wonderfully.   Finally 4 rolls which were also great. Fish was fresh and the the portions generous.  Great fish to rice ratio.  I loved that they actually knew what ponzu sauce was and provides it for our meal.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Big Eye was fantastic! My boyfriend and I were in town for a concert, and I found Big Eye and was immediately intrigued. They had a Maki Sushi Deluxe Dinner combo, so we got soup, salad, and four rolls for $27 total! The food came out quickly, and though the server forgot our beer (no biggie!), everything else was exceptional! We slammed our food, it was absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"Overall: Freshest fish in the area (along with Sushi Asia Gourmet), but average sushi rice (Sakura is still the best in that department). I have been coming here more and more for my Chirashi to get away from the crowds at Sakura. I am a bit surprised that this place doesn't attract more of a crowd.  Food: I am a creature of habit. If I am at a sushi restaurant, I am ordering one thing and one thing only: the Chirashi.  Bigeye's Chirashi eeks out Sakura's by a hair just because the fish is consistently fresher. However, there could be some improvement in the sushi rice department. It is not very well-seasoned. They also only provide you with enough for about 4 pieces of sashimi (maybe 6 if I ask for extra, and 8 if I ask for extra and stretch it). I like my rice. Can you tell?  Service: I have been served by the same waiter the last couple of times, who also appears to be the host and perhaps manager. He is nice and attentive, but can come off as ingratiating and definitely doesn't remember faces. I was a bit put off when I stopped in for a takeout order and he told the hostess that was helping me that the happy hour prices didn't apply to takeout . . . not that it mattered, but he could have looked me in the eye and said it politely instead of just instructing the hostess and ignoring me, the customer who has patronized this establishment  a lot of times.  Atmosphere: Dark, intimate decor. However, generally empty, perhaps because the strip where it's located doesn't get a lot of traffic in general (it's next to a Talbots and BMV . . .)"}
{"text":"Sushi in big wooden boats!  I have to say, I'm impressed. Coming from the San Francisco, a town that prides itself on good food, fresh fish, and inventive sushi, I didn't have super high hopes about sushi in Ohio. Our family in the area loves sushi, so they picked what they thought was the best place around, and took us to Big Eye. I thought that the menu was very creative and varied, the fish was fresh, and the portions were large for a sushi place. It was priced slightly less than the sushi places I'm used to, and you really get your money's worth.  I really enjoyed the Damon roll (yellowtail, scallion and cream cheese) and the Yummy and Kiss rolls. My husband had sashimi that was a thick cut and very good. In addition, their house hot sake is actually very good. The decor is warm, elegant, and inviting, and I thought the staff was very nice. Maybe not the most knowledgeable about sushi, but to be honest, I don't really care."}
{"text":"I just want to give an up to date review of Big Eye since I go there often and it sounds like a lot has changed since some of the earlier reviews.  First of all, they do have a license for alcohol.  Yes, it's only beer and wine, but they do have a small but serviceable selection.  I also agree that the miso soup could be tweaked to make it more appealing.  If you're going for flavor though, try the hot shrimp soup.  On to the sushi - that's why you're there anyways, right?  I go to Big Eye about once every couple weeks and have been going for quite a while now, so I've been there a lot.  I typically order a couple rolls and some nigari (raw fish on a pad of rice).  In all the times I've gone I've only had one night where some of the fish wasn't up to par.  That night the spicy tuna was a bit old tasting, but everything else was okay.  All in all, I've had excellent food and have tried most of their selections.  Service good?  Yes, they hire younger wait staff, but they generally are friendly and work hard.  Wait time - yes, sometimes it takes a long time to get your order.  There are only two people making sushi (the owner and his sidekick, the korean Elvis), so when the place is busy it will take a while for the food to come.  As they say - good food isn't fast.  My suggestion is to no go if you're in a hurry.  Save Big Eye for a Saturday night with friends.  Order a couple bottles of sake, kick back and enjoy some conversation.  Another tip - the place does not draw a late night crowd, so any night close to closing you can get right in and out.  Overall, I heartily recommend Big Eye to my friends for great Akron sushi."}
{"text":"Me and a few friends stop by to get our lunch. I like how they decorate the place and the accessories on the wall but I don't really like what I've ordered. The Spicy California roll was ok but I didn't like my Shrimp Yakisoba. Maybe next time I'll order something else (:"}
{"text":"I have been going to Big Eye for awhile now. I have tried a few others in the area and while they are good I keep coming back here. The service is fantastic and the sushi chefs are willing to accommodate special requests.   If you are looking for things to try be sure to check out their specials or a few of these: Soup - Lobster Bisque - While not Japanese it is fantastic Sushi / Sashimi:  Chirashi Dinner Rolls: Tango, OMG, Red Dragon"}
{"text":"Big Eye always stays consistent. Consistently great for sushi that is. We stopped there on Christmas eve not thinking they would be open. We had excellent service. The sushi was extra fresh ( which it always is), and really hit the spot. They had just introduced a new roll with tempura oyster in it. It also had tomato, avocado, and some type of light wasabi sauce on top. The flavors really came together for exquisite taste. Keep up the great work Big Eye. We have been long time customers and will continue to return."}
{"text":"I never thought that I would enjoy sushi so much! The few times that I have been here, the rolls have been fresh and evenly cut, the servers are attentive but not overly so, and the sushi comes out quickly. The atmosphere is relaxing and allows for conversation. I recommend going during Happy Hour, which I believe to be from 5-7PM on Wednesday. My boyfriend and I ordered 8 rolls, which came up to less than $30. Just keep in mind that the sushi has to be consumed in restaurant for the Happy Hour discount. I highly recommend stopping by if you are in the area. I doubt that you'll be disappointed!"}
{"text":"They have Happy Hour from 4:30-6 and this is the time I would go.  Their sushi was okay, nothing spectacular.  No liquor license yet either."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here, the staff are wonderful, and no matter how ridiculous the amount of sushi we order is, I've never caught the flicker of judgement and awe that I've got at some other places  The atmospherre is quiet and romantic, a little more intimate at lunch time, but you could also have a great time with friends here.  The serivice is amazing and the sushi is delicious. The tempura maki lunch is an amazing deal for how much food you get. Do yourself a favor and go eat some sushi here."}
{"text":"Yikes - disappointing.  Service was fine with the picky exception the server we had was new and didn't know the menu yet.  At the very least, it would have been nice if he actually knew sushi since its the same names regardless of where you go.  The biggest complaint is by far the sushi itself.  In two words....not fresh.  Especially for a Tues, the fish should have been fresh.  The golden rule of sushi eating is no sushi on Sundays or Mondays since most places will not get deliveries on those days.  If you're going to serve raw fish for your core business, its gotta be (did I mention?) FRESH!  The fish did not have the odor, taste or texture consistent with being fresh -  it had the characteristics of having been in the fridge too long.  Now that Im on this \"complaint wagon\" I'd be remiss if I didnt also point out their miso soup was also below average - way too much seaweed.  First time I can ever remember not finishing a bowl - miso is tough to screw up.  So, no use continuing to paint this bad picture.  There are several other places to go in the area for a much better sushi experience - go there.  If this is your last resort, go Italian."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had - and I'm from Austin, TX where we have a huge selection of restaurants! Food was beautifully crafted and you could tell they only use premium ingredients. Even the basic rolls such as the Cali Roll tasted AMAZING! The pricing was also impressive. We ordered 4 specialty rolls, 3 traditional rolls, calamari, a seaweed salad, & a house salad for almost $100.   Not only do they have beautiful interior decor, but they also have the sweetest, most attentive service. If you can't tell, I thoroughly enjoyed myself here and will definitely make one more stop before heading home."}
{"text":"The sushi is fresh but the execution is sometimes lacking. I have more times than not received maki that had uneven slices. Some pieces were very small and some pieces would not fit in your mouth.  This last visit, the sushi chef was chewing gum. It might be me, but I don't like to see the guy preparing my food chewing."}
{"text":"I was in the area and a friend recommended Bigeye. I came on a Monday night, pretty dead. The inside is kind of traditional but not really dated/dingy looking. I had a seat at the sushi bar and ordered a glass of wine which was decent.   I got the regular sushi dinner. It was 8 pieces of nigiri and a tuna roll. I asked for salmon to be substituted for the tuna roll and they fulfilled my request without an issue. I was served miso soup and salad. The salad was fine, pretty standard for a Japanese restaurant. The miso soup was good, not too salty which is important.   My dinner came out and it looked lovely. It was a nice mix of fish. The rice was perfectly constituted and nothing fell apart as I picked it up with chopsticks. The fish was very fresh and delicious, it was cut well. The only thing is they do not put wasabi on it so it's up to you to do that. It's not a big deal considering it's suburbia. I would not hesitate to eat here again."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite sushi restaurant since they opened years ago! They have the freshest food which is also much more authentic than other places in Akron. I love the intimate setting and the diversity of the menu. I get the Sashimi Deluxe every time and have never been disappointed! Go now!!!"}
{"text":"Big Eye has some pretty good sushi.  It has been awhile since I have been here, but I used to go once a week during their 1/2 price sushi special from 4-6pm with a bunch of friends.  The fish is fresh.  I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here the other night for her birthday. I have been here multiple times and am somewhat known as a regular.  I love their maki rolls, if you love the basic spicy crab then you must try it here!  I also recommend the spicy scallop.  The spicy mayo is actually spicy here compared to Sakura's sweet spicy mayo and that is the way I prefer it.  I always have a great experience here the servers are excellent and the hostess is awesome.  Yes you are going to wait a awhile to receive your sushi during their happy hour, it's happy hour and very busy!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is amazing very delicious and very relaxing and chilled environment they have happy hour between 5 and 6 p.m. during the week and you get half off of your sushi during that time totally worth the money."}
{"text":"Really great service,  food was pretty average or at least the fish quality, had the sashimi app salmon and escolar were good, pretty typical for NOE, tuna was frozen block yellow fin. That being said not sure if tjere are better option for you Akronians"}
{"text":"I Love Big eye! Mr. Kim and Jackie are excellent sushi shokunin. Good selection of yakatori, ramen, and udon as well. The hot lime soup and lobster bisque are also notable. Try the crab puffs!"}
{"text":"Get there before 2pm - not 2:30 pm for lunch! Walked in and they were closed. Guess I'll Have try another day and write my review. Blah! Now where do I find sushi Yelp?"}
{"text":"The sushi here is quite good and the prices are acceptable. One highlight is the calamari for two appetizer. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"This is my go to Sushi joint. They also have great vegetable curry. The owner is always extremely friendly to customers and takes the time to make sure all customers are taken care of. If you have certain dietary concerns they will help you make different selections and also make dishes especially to meet your needs."}
{"text":"This place has a good atmosphere, but the wait staff is lacking. They're slow to bring drinks and refill water, and they don't have any \"table presence.\"   The sushi is good, albeit totally over-priced compared to 3 other sushi places in the area.   I've been twice and I'll probably go back one more time to give it another opportunity, but that's it for me."}
{"text":"Had a great time and great food at Big Eye. Overall the sushi was good. The seaweed salad was great, the crab puffs were delicious, and the saki sangria was AMAZING:-) service was good, and the environment was adequate:-) I would return."}
{"text":"Not only did I wait 30 min for 2 rolls, the waitress brought me the wrong roll, charged me more for the roll I actually ordered and never once asked how my food was! Really disappointing!"}
{"text":"Just horrible!  We waited an hour for a soup AND the meal!  Meanwhile, everyone else was waiting and two ppl that just left with carry out cam right back bc the orders were wrong.  We had to be somewhere else so asked that the food we never had be bagged-- that took another 20mins! To add insult to injury, OUR order was wrong!  We called back and asked for the manager but she continued to dodge us while we could hear her in the background.  Very unprofessional, unorganized, and just disappointing!  The food was good and our male server was good but service overall was horrible"}
{"text":"So far the best sushi I have had in this area of Ohio! Coming from south florida I have had some amazing fresh sushi so I really have to say that it was a nice change from most places I've had here, It was light and refreshing. Perfect balance of rice and fish! I loved it and can't wait to go back! I ordered take out because I was in a hurry, but the service for take out was awesome, the guy was patient and I didn't feel rushed and my food came out fast which was nice! Inside looked very cozy Ike a great date night spot! Dim inside and cozy:) I read on the window that Monday-Friday 5-6pm is half off Maki rolls dine in only which is great and will definitely have to try some time. Most of the sushi I have had here has not really tasted fresh or there is too much rice but this place was very good:) ---will have to eat again and dine in to get a full experience for the place."}
{"text":"I like there to be predictability in my raw fish.  As in: I like to know that there will be a quality of product commensurate with the amount of money I'm spending to purchase said product.  I know that is very capitalist of me.  So sue me, I'm broke!  It's a reasonable request.  BigEye Sushi was just... meh.  It wasn't good, it wasn't bad...  Well, not exactly true: the service was slow and inattentive.  They charged us for soup they never brought (granted they did take it off the bill once it was pointed out, but come on!)  The portions were TINY.  Yeah, I know. I put \"tiny\" in big letters just to emphasize how small the portions actually were.  Seriously, I've never seen rolls or nigiri that small before in my life... it was almost cute it was so small.  Tiny.  Their specialty rolls were decent.  Nothing to write home about.  Good, but not the \"better than sex\" good that I expect out of my sushi.  They get two extra stars from the one I would give them based on price, portion and service; because, it was clear that their fish was fresh - not flash frozen - and, the sashimi (though cut in tiny portions) was quite tasty.  I don't think I'll be back - as if I'm going to get sushi in Crackron I think I'll stick with the place that I know which kicks ass - but, it wasn't a totally wasted trip."}
{"text":"Big Eye is the best sushi place in Fairlawn. The place is nice inside, the service is not intrusive. There's no language barrier placing your order or asking a question. If you show up during the half-price 4-6pm time slot you might feel crowded but if you get there at another time it is usually quiet and pleasant.   The sushi has always been fresh and well-prepared when I have been there. The beer and sake are good. They got their liquor license a year ago, so you don't have to wash down your futomaki with fountain cokes any more.  This is a great choice in the Fairlawn area."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the sushi and service here. We ordered 6 rolls and the spicy crab salad. The rolls were fantastic but the spicy crab salad wasn't that great. I will return to try other rolls though."}
{"text":"Enjoyed very much! Service was super. Food was delicious. Reasonably priced. Sushi was fresh and colorful. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Growing up in Hawaii I was a tad leery of eating sushi so far away from home. Though the wait was extremely long I have to say it was worth it.   I sat at the sushi bar and was glad I did cause watching the sushi artist prepare the rolls helped make the time pass by.  We ordered the adashi tofu - the lobster roll and some roll with eel on it(my cousin's choice).   Everything was made to the highest quality and p  \"picture perfect\" standards. However, the wait was too long and I really got tired of my waitress harassing the sushi chefs.   All in all - it was worth the wait. And if you speak a little bit of Nihongo (Japanese) be sure to say something to the Sushi Chefs...it makes their day!"}
{"text":"I had planned on going to a favorite sushi spot with my parents this evening, however, my flight was delayed by an hour & the normal spot was closed.  I am SO GLAD we ended up coming to Big Eye.  The prices are really reasonable for the quality of food.  The flavor combinations are unique and delicious.  The service was really, really great!!!  10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"I've got mixed feelings for Big Eye. I have ate here twice, and each time wasn't exactly the same.  The first time I went here with a group of friends on a weeknight after work for their happy hour special (1/2 off maki rolls). It was great! We ordered a mass amount of sushi and we all devoured it. California and the Crab salad are my two fav's.  The second time was a Saturday afternoon I took my momma out for her first sushi adventure.. The sushi I felt was just Okay this time. She had got tuna and some kind of salmon roll. And I got the California and a new one I'd never had( I forget now?!).. My rolls were okay, but not as good as the previous trip. I tried my momma's and was definintely not a fan.  But all in all, if you go during the week, during happy hour (cheap $$!) you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service is excellent, the food was very good and I found the ambiance to be nice and quiet."}
{"text":"In the last week I revisited Big Eye! They have about a dozen new specialty rolls and my goal is to try all of them. So far 3 down 9 more to go! The Perfect Match, 2017 and I think it was the Fairlawn. Either way Jenny the owner is doing an amazing job with the place!  This one should be on your list for sure."}
{"text":"I came here once for Happy Hour when I was down in Akron seeing my mom and realized I had forgotten my housekeys and needed to waste some time waiting for her to come home.  First, they turned me away because Happy Hour was apparently 1/2 hour later than advertised...and it was completely not worth the wait.  It was possibly one of the most negative sushi experiences I have had in recent memory.  The fish did not taste fresh, and I almost had to choke it down.  I feel really bad saying all this because the owners seem sincere.  But hopefully they will read this review and up their standards.  Thanks."}
{"text":"I won't eat here outside of their happy hour, because their prices are higher than my favorite sushi joint which is about two miles down Market Street.  I did love their lettuce wraps, even though they were a bit heavy on the Sriracha.  For a better selection and consistent quality, i'd go to Sakura. But for decent sushi at decent prices, do Big Eye's happy hour."}
