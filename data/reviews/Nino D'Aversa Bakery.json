{"text":"I recently went to the Aurora location of Nino D'Aversa Bakery for some pizza dough, I went to the fridge to find small flat balls of dough upon seeing this I thought this is a Pizza place perhaps they will sell me a fresh ball of dough.When I questioned a staff member I was told how to make the small flat ball of dough rise and that it would take only a few minutes. When I asked again about purchasing a fresh ball from the back I was told we are not a bake shop at which point I left and went to another local bakery which sold me a fresh ball of dough no questions asked for half the price of Nino D'Aversa Bakery Bakery. I found this particular staff member very rude and unpleasant to deal with,therefore I will not return!"}
{"text":"Food is really good, they make the best panzarotti that I have ever had.   Their pizza served from the hot table isn't that great, I would avoid that all together. I really enjoy their veal sandwiches too.  I have yet to try any of their sweets, but they all look tasty.  If your looking for someplace new to try I would suggest Ni√±o D'Aversa Bakery."}
{"text":"Ridiculous! Four of us came to the restaurant tonight. There were 6 customers in the entire restaurant.  We asked to sit in one of their larger booths because my parents are elderly and the extra room would have helped.  We were informed that there would be a 15% surcharge on the bill because of the size of the booth!  This defines logic and all laws of commons sense as the amount of effort involved in serving 4 people at a table or 4 people at a booth is the same.  This restaurant really hasn't figured out how to enhance the customer experience and is struggling to the point of extinction.  Its too bad, really, as the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner. Although it is a great place for coffee and desert, I would never recommend for dinner.   It is confusing. Either you order pizza from the almost non existent server, or you walk to the hot table and wait forever for food. So, essentially no one eats at the same time.   Pizza:  I love wood oven pizza. I ordered the margarita which was described as tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil. When I got it I was shocked there was dried basil on it. Not fresh. Weird.   If you want good pizza, go to Joia. This pizza wasn't good at all.   Also, ordered a glass of wine, and not once did the server ask if I wanted more, nor did she ask any of us how our dinner was. I just thought the service wasn't good and the food was nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best (if not the best) cappuccinos I've had in Toronto. They also have a wide array of delicious pastries available (Portuguese custard tarts, zeppole, etc.) Provides a very friendly and warm atmosphere in addition to a great selection of Italian food and treats."}
{"text":"Horrible attitude of manager. We had a business breakfast meeting on Saturday, June 7, 2014 at 10a where we spend a good amount of money of coffee and entrees. The manager was constantly yelling to his staff to clean tables across the restaurant embarrassing the staff and other patrons as well. The icing was when the manager barked to us telling us to go somewhere else because \"this was not an office\". This was after an hour while we were still having our coffee! He had 2 waiters on our heads asking us to \" wrap up\" and leave. We collected our shred of decency and promptly left --- never to return back -- and ensuring nobody we know also does the same. The food? Meh. I can have scrambled eggs and toast in a gazillion different places. Nothing exciting here."}
{"text":"I love the veal sandwiches here! They're always fresh and delicious. The portions are very large too. The pasta sauce tastes homemade and authentic.  I've tried several of the desserts here and they're really good too! They have a large selection of Italian pastries.   I don't usually dine in but order to go."}
{"text":"Lovely cozy and unique setting. The egg tarts are amazing !!! Great for a fun new change to date night. Workers were all wonderfully pleasant. Only complaint is that it's a bit pricey, and the tiramisu I ordered was very bad (didn't finish it). Regardless, I am happy to have found this place and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice spacious location and venue. You can order pizza from menu or other dishes from hot-table like pasta, sandwiches, veggie sides etc.  Pizza was made fresh and was awesome. We got a side of large rapini from the hot table to complement our pizza.     Like the food just not thrilled about their service- not attentive nor friendly.  Looks like other reviewers thought the same and we weren't the only ones.    My rating is for the food 3stars. Not in a rush to come back because of service."}
{"text":"I used to go to this location on a weekly basis with my wife and kids and after tonight's experience will never dine here again because of the pompous owner/manager. I ordered two pizza's to go and picked them up and drove home only to discover that one pizza was made incorrectly. (Not the end of the world) so the I tell the girl on the phone what my order should have been on the phone and she puts me on hold for a minute manager/owner gets on the phone and says they're busy and should come back in 20 minutes or so. I show up and my pizza is wrong again and he's blaming me for being incorrect. He laughs it off and orders another one. So I'm waiting another 20 minutes for my pizza. I ask the girl at the counter for a refund because I've been put out an hour because of their initial error. The manager blows me off and despite me reminding him how often I come there he won't give me a refund. Clearly he doesn't know how good customer service works and I will now never visit this place again thanks to his attitude and doesn't care about customers. If you're looking for rude/poor customer service look no further."}
{"text":"Really bad service. No one ready was at the deli to serve for a very long time, and then when they finally arrived, one lady asked me to wait for a tremendous amount of time by putting her finger in the air signalling me, rather than being speaking politely. I then watched as a second server behind the deli approached only to serve herself. I called out several times for help but was ignored. I was waiting to be served as she ate snacks (not on break) instead of serving food. When I finally decided to leave, they then asked me what I wanted (only after seeing frustration, and walking away)."}
{"text":"The worst lasagna ever had and very expensive ! Will never come back here ! The service was so poor and the food was soooo bad :("}
{"text":"WORST. SERVICE. EVER.  My boyfriend and I were in the area and decided to stop in for a quick lunch. Upon arrival, we noticed very few people so we figured that we would get our lunch quickly and leave to continue with our errands. WRONG. There were at least 10 people working at the time and they all seemed disinterested in the customers around them. It took us wandering for a bit for someone to actually notice that we were there and needed help. At which point, we were told to seat ourselves and would be given a menu to be soon served. Mind you, we already told her what we wanted...so this was a needless process. It took someone at least 10 mins to make it back to our table with a menu, and another 20 for someone to take our order. The food then took an hour to make it to us (we only ordered a pizza...)  Luckily, tips aren't expected because we definitely weren't going to award such poor service. Definitely WILL NOT be back."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday evening for dessert with the family. 2 adults, and 3 children. Hostess wouldn't seat us in a booth saying their policy was not to seat parties of less than 5 in a booth. (I didn't realize children weren't consider people) The policy is fine except the place was 1/4 full, and there were two booths with parties of 4. I brought it up with the cashier on the way out, and she told me I was mistaken. The parties in the booth had more people but they must have been walking around. I always appreciate it when the cashier calls me a liar."}
{"text":"The staples of bread and desserts are great. But what I go for is the delicious pizza.   It's a tad expensive for $25 but I still haven't found a place locally that can meet it."}
{"text":"Haven't popped in here much this summer for gelato but tonight I was feeling for some.  Decided to go for a run and enjoy some gelato... Figured if I run there the i deserve some gelato :)."}
{"text":"We arrived at about 7.15pm and were seated quite quickly. Soon there were lines behind us. Must be decent we thought. If you have never been here, pizza is ordered using the menu, but other food like veal parmigianna, desserts, salads were ordered at the counters. Neither the hostess nor the waitress told us this which is bad training, and we had to ask  - loose half a point.  There were 2 of us and we ordered a small (Personal Size) Romana pizza, substituting the mushrooms with sun dried tomatoes.   After that we waited literally 30mins, but nothing arrived. No one bothered to check on us which I found ridiculous - loose a point  We asked a waitress and she checked - staff forgot our pizza and it would take 5 mins. No apologies, nothing - loose a point.  THe pizza arrived with nice, fragrant, and delicious. We also had the Carnoli and gelato for dessert, and they were very well done. THe flavour of the chocolate and hazelnuts came through and it was not too sweet. -gold star!  When the bill came, we found that we were charged for the substitution of the mushrooms - how come no one told us about this? Sigh....loose another point.  So yeah - the food is good, but the staff need a little more help. Go if you want good food, but be prepared assert yourself because the staff really werent too helpful the evening I went."}
{"text":"It's a bakery, with a few supermarket goods on one side, and a lunch counter on the other side.   The staff were so kind, sweet and helpful, and the food is home-cooked Italian!  Delizioso!  I am almost never in this area (Keele and Finch), nor in the Burbs where their other locations are (Vaughn, Thornhill, etc) but I will go out of my way to visit here anytime I am close.    No frills, no fuss, and nothing pretentious...just good food and good people."}
{"text":"This location is pretty large compared to the other locations. It's open concept, just one large room really, and there is plenty of seating. The bar in the middle of the room, hit table at the rear, the pizza oven off to the side, and the cash right at the exit.   I came here for pizza with a friend, and the pizza was thin, almost too thin. It was hard to pick up, as the slices would bend when you tried to pick them up. My big thing with the pizza though, was that both my friend and myself had stomach aches after eating there. We've never gone back there to eat.   The espresso is also not that great. I've had worse, but it was both weak and bitter at the same time.   It was also confusing when the time came for us to pay. Because the cash is at the door, the idea is that you go up to the cash and pay for what you had, but servers have to give them a receipt for what you've ordered, and as you go up to get an espresso yourself, the waitress doesn't serve you, so it's all a confusing mess by the time you want to pay. We had to wait for the person who served us to find our bill, and then had an issue telling the cashier that we had an espresso as well as a pizza. It's a confused set up, trying to be both a sit down restaurant and a bakery at the same time.   Some of the food at their hot table looked ok, but I'm not planning on going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I purchased a big box of gelato from this bakery. After I sat down and was about to eat it, this lady who looked like the owner, walked over quickly to kick us out. Apparently, you are not allowed to eat gelato at their restaurant, although they had lots of unoccupied tables. First time to ever be kicked out from a bakery for trying to eat their food at their own dining area."}
{"text":"Best chocolate cupcakes I've ever had in my life!! Amazing cookies, cakes, and pastries as well. Wood oven pizza looks good have not tried it yet though. Paninis are decent."}
{"text":"Went to this bakery after hearing a recommendation from a friend.  I can tell to that its a lot more than just bread at Nino Daversa.  I opted for the stone oven pizza.  There aren't too many places where you can still get authentic stone oven pizza in aurora.  Mine came with the standard cheese, green peppers and pepperoni.  It was absolutely perfect.  A friend ordered the lasagne plate which also looked really appetizing so I might try that next time.   The service was also fast and friendly.  The line at the hot table looked a little long around lunch time when we got there but not seemed to zip by pretty quickly. Wish they were open later for those late night carb cravings but ill definitely be coming back here.  It's not your typical greasy hot table and a welcome change from some of the other food options in the area."}
{"text":"I've only tried the bakery here. Came in quite late in the evening at around 8pm or so and still found that the pastries were quite fresh. It was still soft, although I was hoping for more varieties. Taste wise, it was decent, nothing too overwhelming or sweet. The restaurant itself seemed a little empty during the time while there wasn't much flavors in the gelato counter but I'm assuming that's because it's winter and really cold out. I feel like the pastries look visually more appealing than it actually tastes."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian fare.  What a great selection!  Excellent service.  Staff are attentive, polite  and prompt."}
{"text":"Three cheesecake slices and two coffees for $25.  Not even very big slices.  Wow, expensive.  I can just imagine how much a full meal with cheesecake slices and coffee for three would be.  The service pretty much didn't exist.  We were actually sat at a dirty table."}
{"text":"Great place for a coffee and desert or hot lunch or freshly prepared pizza. I love this place. Very conveniently located on Wellington between yonge and Bayview. Been here many times and always a great experience."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, burnt but edible, service was bad, asked for a grapefruit san pellegrino, got a blood orange, waiter didn't crack a smile. Average"}
{"text":"Pizza slices are now smaller and not as good. All i tasted was undercooked tomato sauce and the cheese and pepperoni separated from the pizza after biting into it. $3.50 for a sad slice thats smaller than the plate its in.  Also bought a large calamari and shrimp for $30. Save your money. The shrimp isnt as large as before, calamari is small and chewy and the batter is non existent and soggy.  So to recap, this bakery has raised prices, reduced portions and cut down on quality. Good job."}
{"text":"\"Do you want Hot Peppers, red peppers, mushrooms on your sandwhich??\" \"A dollar pop\" Sandwich went from overpriced 7 to exorbitant 10 dollars. But they forgot to put some meat into their cutlets.  Nothing \"italian\" about this location.. Or maybe this one is the ball that the foot loves to kick"}
{"text":"Split a large pizza with nothing but soppressata on it and it was to die for! The crust in thin and crispy with a delicious flavour.  Used the hot oil drizzled over top as well. Reasonably priced for the high quality of the food.  Finished it off with a coffee and a slice of ricotta cake which was super fresh."}
{"text":"Delicious gelato and pastry, I would recommend this place if you have a special event. Very good also for catering. You should try everything in this location.  They have a nice patio outside"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some gelato, read the reviews here and gave the place a try. The place was buzzing on a Saturday afternoon, which was a good sign. I headed to the gelato counter to look at the flavors. From out of nowhere, this kid at the cash barks out \"if you want to buy gelato you need to pay first\". This was my first time here, so obviously have no idea how things operate. But his tone was very \"hey, idiot, stop staring and if you want to buy, come here first\". Whatever... So I go to pay for it and he very rudely asks \"what do you want?\". What an a$$! If I wasn't craving gelato so hard I would've walked out.   Anyway, I got my gelato. Reasonably priced at $4 for a small cup. To be honest, I've had better. I might come back and try the food. It looked really good and authentic. If I do come back, I'll be sure to pay for my stuff before I even look at it. :$"}
{"text":"I used to love this place as it is the only bakery close to my house, but the olives are always mushy, the ladies behind the meat/cheese/dessert counter rush you even if the place is dead, and are extremely rude when you ask questions. The owner picked stuff up off of the floor and proceeded to (without washing his hands) go and rearrange the fresh bread section. None of their baguettes are ever soft, always crunchy and hurt your mouth, and a poor selection of cheeses."}
{"text":"Finally tried that giant breaded deep fried rice ball... no flavor and brings nothing but carbs and fat. Stay away.   Still a good place though."}
{"text":"Do not like this bakery it is not a real Italian bakery the food is not so good or fresh."}
{"text":"I love the old school Italian vibe that this place gives off. You can smell sweetness and bread baking before entering the building. I have had many of their desserts, they are all so fresh and delicious. Their food is a bit pricy... The pizza is good but it was over $20 so I didn't try it again."}
{"text":"Nino came North!  The Toronto based bakery/tavalo calda (hot table) and espresso bar has been dishing out the finest Italian-style baked goods and food in the GTA for more than 40 years is now in Aurora.  While I don't frequent this place location as often as I should (it's literally a 10 minute drive from my house) after my lunch experience today, I certainly think I will be more often - that or I won't leave today because of how full I currently am. Dio Mio (my god)!  This place is a splash of class and sophistication in the heart of Aurora right along Wellington Ave (between Bayview and Yonge). The decor is simple and yet elegant and the vibe in here says that you can come here for lunch on a Sunday with the family or stop in for a quick espresso or cappuccino with your Sang-wich any other day of the week. They have a full service espresso bar, deli counter with a large assortment cold-cuts, they also have a fully stocked bakery with breads and baked goodies AND if that wasn't enough they have a Wood Oven for fresh made to order pizzas.  Nino's allows you to reserve a booth if you so desire for larger parties, or you can choose from one of over 20 tables in the restaurants (they're all numbered - I didn't count). Probably the best seating in the house, is actually out of it - Nino's has a beautiful interlocked patio with plenty of seating for those hot summer days or nights :)  Early I mentioned just how full I was and rightly so, I decided to come here for a little lunch and I got more than I could handle. I stopped by their hot table and was overwhelmed by the delish options at my disposal...  *** Side note, when I get overwhelmed and am hungry, awful moments of gluttony happen. I will either order everything or too much or both...and then I suffer**  ...After viewing the options on the menu board and on the table in front of me I decided on a piece of homemade lasagna, some deepfried calamari and shrimp and an assortment of veggies. What I received was enough for 2-3 people and perhaps even left overs. Two plate piled high with food!  The lasagna was beautifully cooked with lots of cheese and the seafood and veggies are no different than an Italian Nonna (grandmother) would make for Sunday dinner.  I would fully recommend this place to family and friends as the friendly service and quality food is worth the trip any day of the week."}
{"text":"It's Victoria Day, after dinner, and we're on the hunt for gelato. I pull up Yelp (of course!), and find Nino D'Aversa just down the road! I had been here once before, but just to pick up some Italian treats. I'm so glad we stopped here! Friendly, great selection of gelato, and reasonably priced. We also picked up some treats for home (custard tarts and cookies for me, tiramisu and macaroons for my friend) - rave reviews all around! Next time, have to make a lunchtime spot, the hot table looks amazing!"}
{"text":"Deserves 0 stars. Seriously tired of this place. I've given it far more chances then it deserved.  I've been here at least a dozen times since it's opened and it's been the same each time. Service is absolutely horrible, Managers seem to think they are well above everyone who comes in. Very rude and not gracious at all for your service.   To top it all off they never have any cannoli's, every time I go in they are all out. Doesn't matter the time of day because I've tried them all.  YOU ARE AN ITALIAN BAKERY, IS IT THAT DIFFICULT TO MIX SOME RICOTTA AND SUGAR AND PIPE INTO A CANOLLI SHELL?   I'll just go to Longo's to get a canolli, at least they make them fresh for me without the attitude.   Over it. They've lost my business."}
{"text":"I haven't ventured out to this area in eons. While visiting friends in this neck of the woods they recommended this spot for gelato. This place is open late apparently so might work for you if you want to get a late night dessert fix. The space is huge and even has outside seating. Lots of Italian focused food items/desserts. It might be a decent alternate to your local store if you want to get some coveted items. I was here for gelato but the baked items looked decent. Now for the gelato hmm not a very good version of it IMO.  Neither creamy nor flavourful I would say about the same level as box version from some mass produced brand. I would try the baked goods and the hot plate as they looked a bit better."}
{"text":"Stone Oven baked pizza is very good as is the veal cutlet dinner or sandwich. Homemade fresh Italian food and bread. Great selection for dessert including Italian gelato, cookies, fresh cakes and cup cakes.  Espresso and Cappuccino is marvelous too!"}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time for pizza, gelato and desserts. All the staff here are incredibly rude, they told my younger cousin AFTER we paid for gelato that she's only allowed to try 2 samples per person. She gave us sample spoons and we threw it out cause it has gelato on it, when we finally got our order we asked for fresh spoons and she got angry and said \"I gave you spoon- why did you throw out the other spoons I gave you\".   This is the fifth rude encounter I've had in 2 months. I will no longer be coming to this location, I will get the same desserts for cheaper at Coppa's near Dufferin and Steeles."}
{"text":"Went here to pick up pizza dough. At the register, two packages of dough came out to $10. I rubbed my eyes and asked if there was a mistake. Nope, each package is $5...  ... So I drove to No a Frills where I bought, wait for it, Nino D'Aversa pizza dough for, wait for it, $2 each.  And that was the last time I went to this Nino D'Aversa."}
{"text":"This is a great cafe for a casual dine in or take out.   They serve hot lunches: stone even pizza, sandwiches, salads, chicken park...etc. a section of the place is also a grocery store: get some freshly Baked baguette, milk, cheese, Chocolate, and more but in my opinion....I would say they know they desserts really well! Freshly baked pies, cakes, so many pastries!!!! Oh my i forgot to mention the gelato!!!  Typically I walkin and grab a dessert to go but today I dined in. We were seated right away but a friendly staff lady.  The table was clean. And our server came right over with menus. She was quick with our orders. The cheesecake was light and delicious but id say the tiramisu was a little lacking in flavour but it was still a good cake !  We ordered lattes and hats off to the barista !!! A great blend of milk and espresso and some brown sugar to sweeten the deal!!!   Server was friendly and provided great service.  Will definitely return here and try some of their food too!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place many for the gellato. The one time we ordered pizza, the crust was extra burnt... so we've never done anything but gellato here from then on."}
{"text":"Ordered a cake for my Mom's 65th birthday party three weeks prior to picking it up.  I requested to pick it up a day before her party so that I would have less running around to do on the day of.  When I went to pick it up on the Friday, the lady at the bakery counter tried to just hand me over the cake without opening it to show me how it looked. Good thing I asked her to show me because when she did, I noticed that they had spelled my Mom's name wrong even though it was written correctly on the order sheet.  No problem, these things happen.  When I pointed out the error to her, she looks at the cake, looks at the order form and says \"no no, it's fine!\" I told her that it's missing an \"n\" in her name.  She then asked me \"Well what do you want us to do?\" UMMMM fix it???  She then tells me that the cake decorator is gone for the day so they can't fix it.  I asked to speak to a manager.  She walks over to the manager and he comes over to speak to me.  I explain the situation to him (his name was JP) and he says that they can fix it now, but it won't look as good as the one I have currently (the one with my Mother's name misspelled). I asked them to write it again and I'll see what it looks like at that time.  He tells me he's going to give me the old chocolate plaque that her name was written on in case I don't like the new one. Well, he was right, it looked terrible.  I don't know whose four year old child they got to write on the cake, but that's exactly what it looked like.  THEN, they scratched off the one N that was in my Mom's name and added two N's written in chocolate to correct it, even though the rest of the writing was in purple.  You can't be serious.  JP asks me how did it turn out and I tell him it looks terrible and he says \"that's what I was telling you\".  I asked him if he had ordered a cake for his Mother's 65th birthday and this was what he received, would he be ok with it?  He stared at me with the blankest stare I've ever seen for 10 seconds until I had to ask him why was he looking at me like that!  I then asked him if the cake decorator is in tomorrow.  He asked me when the cake is for and I told him it's for tomorrow but I chose today to pick it up since I have a lot of running around to do tomorrow.  He said he will have him re-do it and I can pick it up tomorrow morning.  Fast forward to the next morning!  I call and ask to speak to the manager (Dominic) and explain to him what happened yesterday and said I was calling to see if the cake was ready and if my Mother's name was now spelled correctly.  After a placing me on hold forever, he came back on the line and said yes.  When I arrived at the bakery and the lady behind the counter showed me the cake that was supposed to be corrected, HER NAME WAS SPELLED WRONG AGAIN!!!  Clearly Dominic didn't check, so I don't understand why he had me on hold forever.  Luckily the woman who was working cash (I believe her name is Veronica) was the same one who was there the day before when this all happened so I told her that they had spelled my Mom's name wrong again and I swear if it wasn't for her going downstairs to the cake decorator herself, he would've messed it up again.  Honestly, THE WORST customer service.  Some form of competence and an apology from either JP or Dominic would've gone a long way, but instead they both just tried to duck and dodge the situation.  As much as my mom loves their tiramisu cake, I will go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"The food feels homemade, not in a good way but also not in a bad way. It feels like something I would make at home. My friend and I shared the lasagna and for  dessert had the canoli and apple crumb cheesecake.  The lasagna was okay, a lot of pasta and not so much meat and cheese it was okay. The canoli was okay but wasn't as fresh and crunchy as others I've had. The apple crumb cheesecake was good, nothing too spectacular.   The atmosphere is clean and open. It was overall a good experience. Would come back if I'm in the area and had to have something quick and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The interior took me by surprise as to how big it was with four main sections: the mini food court, deli, pastries, and gelato. I came in here to expect a big variety of Italian pastries but was very disappointed to see that they had barely any Italian pastries, rather, random pastries we can find in other bakeries. Their cannoli was not even legitimate instead it tasted more like a really cheap cream puff. As for the eclair, it tasted a tad stale and the quality of it was poor. If I do go back, I'll probably go only for the Baci chocolates."}
{"text":"I go there for the bread. The best in town although a little pricey. The servers are a joke. The ladies do there jobs and I never have had issues with any of them. The guys are a bunch of lazy slobs that would rather text and hang out with there fellow Gino's than serve customers. I do not like this place , if not for the bread I would never enter the building."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good quality, and tastes great. I find it beats common franchises (pizza pizza, pizza nova). The desserts are alright, depending on which one you get. I am a fan of the cannolis and eclairs (although the latter could use more cream). This location is confusing because there are 2 separate areas for desserts, one for stay in and one for take out. In addition to the pizza area, there are 3 areas to pay in total... The first time I came I was running around from one corner to another... On a weekday, they weer surprisingly busy."}
{"text":"I love the pizza, wood burning oven, made in 10 mins, great taste. I am not a fan of the dessert at any of the locations. I found the service here to be nice. The location is large and serves food and coffee as well. I only come here for pizza take out."}
{"text":"First time here, as I came by this area with a friend, and she highly recommended it. Upon entering, I was a little surprised on the layout, as it was a mix between seating and fast food format. Wasn't sure if there was any service, I went and got my own food.  Ended up getting a slice of pizza and a salad. Nice to see there was a wooden oven, and the pepperoni pizza was really good with super thin crust and enough toppings. Salad was also a pretty good deal, as the small was decent sized for $5. They allowed you to add as many of the add-ons as you wanted, including tomatoes, bacon bits, onions, and more.  Overall pretty good, but kinda felt there should have been servers for such a large place..."}
{"text":"If you're ever in this part of town, meaning Thornhill, Nino D'aversa may very well be your destination for a sunday morning capuccino and biscotti, or if you're hungry--their signature veal sandwich.   Personally,I am not a fan of the food section. It lacks freshness and quality, not to mention it is over priced. The service is also really slow and disorganized. It took me 10 min to order/pay for a capuccino and there was only one person ahead of me!   Fairly older crowd..Bring your grandma here!"}
{"text":"Sunday at 4 pm, on my way back to richmond Hill, I went inside ( they have no business hour signs on the premises) and confirmed that they will be open till 10 pm.  Was told yes for sure. Later around  few minutes past 9.pm returned with my family, visiting us from USA, and although couple of girls were cleaning inside they had closed there door for business and on knocking were told that yes we closed early. What?  Are they ok.  Wish could give them minus points for wasting my time and Gas and causing us convenience."}
{"text":"What a neat spot! They have gelato (including dairy free sorbet!!!), pastries, hot food, deli meats, bread and a billion other Italian things. There's also some nice seating outside.   The place is absolutely full of Chinese and Italian people (re: authentic and cheap!) I decided to get a cup of sorbet, and when I wavered on my decision, the lady behind the counter offered to put all three dairy-free flavours in my cup. My small-looking cup turned out to be bigger than my fist. And it was filled to the rim with sorbet. All flavours were delicious.. the lemon was perfectly acidic and sour, the raspberry was very very raspberry and the mango was creamy and wonderful. I was in heaven.  My friends got some cappuccinos and more gelato. We were all very very happy.  Will be back if I'm in the neighbourhood, but probably won't make a special trip."}
{"text":"I always crave eating at Nino D'aversa, there is something about it that feels like home and comfort Italian food at it's best is hard to deny. I've had 3 not so great experiences in a row lately so I'm expressing my frustration in hopes that something might change. Today I went in to pick up lunch for my office last minute. There was no line up so I proceeded to order. The lady behind the counter began lecturing me about the regulars not having any food left because my order was too large, and that I needed to call ahead. I ordered 12 lightly breaded, very thin chicken cutlets and found out they were $5 each as I was paying. My bill was $115 which was so over the top for what we had actually ordered, I paid and left because we were all starving. The food was all completely soggy, old, flavourless and really just a comical letdown considering my office was ok with McDonalds (and it would have been better and cheaper). The previous times before we had ordered pizzas and they came back 3/4 with wrong toppings.   No need to go on, I'll leave you with this... Nino is a fantastic place that I have fond memories of. I think they need to work on the quality of the food, the length of time they keep it on the line for serving, and the general attitude of the staff. I might not be back for a while, hopefully they can change that though."}
{"text":"Basically, a decent place to grab some lunch and some groceries.  As others have said, this is a half-restaurant and half-groceries setup, where the grocery section is baked goods (bread and pastries) as well as a moderate selection of other things (cheese, pasta sauce, etc.).   There were three of us for lunch.  The lines were busy, but didn't take terribly long.  The cafeteria-style food looked a little dry from being out in a cafeteria line for me, so I opted for a pizza, which would be made fresh.  A friend did the same, and a second friend ordered a sandwich, which is also made fresh.  All three of us enjoyed our lunches, although I don't think we're likely to be struck by a strong craving to return.  Basically we were happy with what we had, but just happy.  I also picked up some bread, which I enjoyed, although it is mostly solid traditional bread rather than, say, superb artisanal breads.  I'd go again, but I'm not certain I'd suggest it.  If you're in the area, it's certainly not a bad choice."}
{"text":"Location: 7287 Yonge St, Thornhill, ON L3T 2A9 Price: $ Service: alright   This is a short review since I only came by for a gelato. The service was alright since the server was really friendly. I didn't enjoy this visit as much because the server recommended two gelato ice cream that clearly doesn't go well together... Haha to each their own. Other than that there is not much I can review. However, I would visit again to try their freshly made pizzas!   Verdict: To be continued..."}
{"text":"We ordered a baptism cake for my nieces baptism.  It was Italian rum flavored.  The sponge and cream on the cake was so fresh and moist.     The cake was custom and large enough to feed 18-20 people.  We had plenty of left overs and everyone was happy with the flavor.     Nino has a very large selection of custom cakes and Italian rum cake flavor is my favorite.  I remember my mother getting this cake for all of my birthdays and social occasions.   You can't beat the price either!"}
{"text":"Pizza is not great at this location. The dough and sauce were both average but the cheese was good. Aurora location way better for pizza."}
{"text":"5 star for pizza - thin crust, wood oven good ingredients. I always order the margarita with basil Hot table is slightly above average. Longos is another great option for pizza but crust is thicker."}
{"text":"I've have been to this plaza a million times. Maybe it's due to the non-descript exterior, or the massive size of the shop, I've always passed by this place thinking it's a business to business bakery. One day I got bored or something and went closer for some reason. To my surprise, it's actually a spacious cafe with a hot food section, a gelato section and also some space dedicated to Italian food supplies.   Anyways, this is some of the most mediocre Italian food I've ever had. Their hot food section is very homey, and expensive for their portion and quality. Ok...you specialize in baked goods...I get it. But the few times I walked in I never saw anyone buy anything and it's easy to see why. Prices are exorbitant and as far as I can tell, your pastries have been sitting there for at least a day.. I don't know why you charge $2+ for a Portuguese tart when I can get a good one for like half the price. Their pastries don't look or taste special. Or maybe I just picked the wrong ones?    Anyways...based on the things I tried, I have no reason to come back. I would love a good Italian place to open up in this area. Their stuff is edible but they either need to drop prices quite significantly to match their quality, or make their food and baked goods better to match their price."}
{"text":"I usually grab quick lunches from Nino...much like other Italian Bakeries, they have a hot table with the usual suspects: pasta, meatballs, veal, and so forth. Quality is mediocre while overpriced. Seatings during rush hours can be challenging. Pizzas aren't that good."}
{"text":"I dropped by the bakery at lunch time on a Friday and there was a bit of a line up as expected. The line moved quickly and the staff were quick with the orders. I see a lot of comments here about poor customer service, but I really didn't think they were rude - just determined to get the line moving. The ladies behind the counter were very nice. I didn't sit in, so I can't comment on the dine in experience. But they were quick and efficient and I was out of there within 10 minutes.   I got the chicken parm plate ($12) from the hot-table with tortellini and vegetables, and it was very good. Huge portion, so I ate it for dinner too. The pastries and sweets looks great, and I wish I could try one of each. I'll definitely have to come back."}
{"text":"Nice Italian place in Aurora! Order pizza there and you won't be disappointed! Bakery is outstanding and the whole place is something that you can call affordable eating out. But the service has to be improved. And I mean it! It is really ridiculous to wait for the orders as well as for such primary thing as cutlery! Guys, come on! You have nice premises, food is awesome, so solve the service issue and your place will be overcrowded!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service!! If I could give them 0 star I would!   During lunch time, myself and my friends were not allowed to sit down at the table unless we bought lunch. That 'rule' is annoying but if that applied to everyone I wouldn't have cared that much. However the circumstances were such that when we were not allowed, certain groups were. Not sure why that would be when that person also did not buy lunch. She bought the same type of food as us, coffee and pastries.   If you are going to be denying seating to certain group of people, be rest assured, we'll never go back to your establishment."}
{"text":"This place is big and its hours are great, from brink of morning to almost midnight. It seem like just an italian bakery but it also service as grocery store for italian product, a restaunt for quick bites and even a corner store for small items  I just went for cake, I think price is a bit high for the size but it was good cake, I dont know if I would revisit, I only stop since it was only place that would be open on sunday after 5 that i could get after work. So that a plus,"}
{"text":"Great place for gelato and Portuguese egg tarts!!! Highly recommend. Haven't tried the food there yet but the pizzas that come out of their stone fire oven look pretty delish."}
{"text":"I've been its other location in the west end, but this one is definitely aesthetically more pleasing (decor wise). The establishment is clean and the windows allow for a lot of natural light.  The seating area is ample and the hot foods station looks decent.  The pizza oven looks awesome!  In search of a tasty pastry, we ordered a custard tart and something like an apple strudel.  Along with a coffee and a San Pellegrino, the total bill came out to 16 something -- which, after tasting the pastries and the coffee, I thought was quite overpriced.  And to be honest, the desserts were okay -- nothing outstanding.  Is it a good place to sit and chat with friends -- seems to attract an older crowd (just like its other location).  Would I come just for its desserts? Probably not."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since I was 15, i'm now 49.  I moved out of the area years ago, but would pop in a few times a year.  It has new owners, it's just not the same."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of similar cafe / bakeries in Italy.  Except they all serve alcohol.    It's always an enjoyable experience because you can start by sitting down and eating a fresh wood oven pizza, then go over to the expresso bar for a shot, and end it off buying some unique items like fresh bread and self poured olive oil."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with their almond cookies. The lemon almond ones are exceptionally life changing!"}
{"text":"My family just ate here for the first time.  We ordered a large cheese pizza and a salad.  My kids, who are typically very picky eaters, loved the pizza.  And this is nothing short of a miracle!  My husband and I found it very thin, but tasty.  I'm sure the more fancy pizza options were tasty, as they looked quite appetizing when they went by us.  You can taste the difference a wood fire oven makes!  The large salad we shared was simple but good-- the basic vinegrette dressing reminded me of the type my own Italian mom would make.  My children wanted desssert and were so pleased with the choices:  my daughter devoured a slice of cheeesecake and my son ate all of his cupcake.  They don't usually eat all their portions, so they obvioulsy liked what they ate.  I snuck a taste of the cheesecake and it was very fresh and yummy.  The food was good overall, but we noted that the service was poor.  The staff were all teenagers and the service was exceptionally slow.  We will certainly be returning, but perhaps not on a very busy Saturday night.  The cost for all of this was about $50."}
{"text":"We went here on Wednesday April 6th at 8.15 PM. It states they are open until 10.00 PM. We have been coming regularly since the day they opened this location and this may very well have been visit #49 or 50. However, we walked in to find 4 staff members, one of which I know to be a manager. Nobody acknowledged that we walked in and we had to ask the pizza maker young man if they were still serving. Then we seated ourselves (there were only 2 other guests, and they left within 10 mins). Eventually a young waitress walked over, not dressed in Nino attire ( normally all black) as she was wearing a pink hoodie. She took out order, extremely uninterested. Brought our drinks, slapped plates down as she almost hissed \"plates\" . Then proceeded to chat loudly with pizza maker for the duration of the prep time. Meanwhile another young man was scrubbing tables and glass showcases. Our food was served and while we ate all 4 people ( no other customers ever showed) chatted loudly across the entire place while cleaning it, well the manager wasn't cleaning- he was chatting and drinking espresso. I had to chase the waitress down where she was cleaning without gloves,to ask for a box for the rest of my pizza, she said she would come and pack it. I watched, and I was right: she put down the cleaning cloth and came straight to the table to pick up the pizza to go box it. I whipped the plate away and asked her to bring the box so I could pack it. Ew!! Then I paid, and because I am a suck- I tipped 15%! Nino D'Aversa, we are regular customers , but after last night, probably never at this location, that was disgusting and rude!!"}
{"text":"Noticing a NEW Bakery as I drive by a local All-Star Wings I start to wonder what its all about and searched it up online where I noticed there are a few of these floating around in different regions of GTA already.  We went through an Automated Sliding Door? Yup, it's part Trattoria, part Pizzeria, part Deli, part Bakery.  We walked in towards the PASTRY and Cafe area right in the center of the store but as it was lunch we had to go to the back corner to stand in line CAFETERIA style to select from a Menu Board that seemed larger than what was displayed in front of us.  Veal Cutlet($8.25) is my GO-TO option when I try places like this and it turned out pretty good and a generous portion that comes with two sides and a BREAD roll.  The Veal and sides was good enough for most but as it was a Bakery, I had to taste the roll and just TEARING it apart was a pleasure and tasting it was even better.  I left the roll last and as a non-frequent bread person, I have to say I'm a FAN of the roll.  No one seemed to request Paninis but Pizza was a popular choice as well as the Pastas, Stuffed Peppers, and Veal/Chicken Sandwiches.  The gentlemen in front of me even got some Tomatoey TRIPE.  I will try it next time, yup!  Passing by the cafeteria corner to our way to the dining area which has NICE Trattoria seating and LCDs was the Pizzeria area where 2 cooks were busy using the wood-fired oven structure.  The dining area was pretty loud, almost Chinese restaurant LOUD as kids were running around while their parents pick up food and run after a child.  As we left, we stroll by the DESSERTS which seem to look pretty enticing but the BAKERY/BREAD area was somewhat out of place as I didn't notice any patrons make use of that area nor the Deli Counter.  If those breads were as GOOD as my bread roll, it should definitely be swamped.  As a reference, I think this place is comparable to St. Phillips Bakery in terms of operations/setup and selection/offerings however each has a different DECOR setting to them where St. Phillips has a more LIVELY Active feel in a compact area while Nino has the CALM Trattoria feel in a more open space.  Good thing I asked if the Bread Roll was FREE with my meal or else I will regret it as it was just placed on the counter to be picked up once you receive your dish from one of the staff."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Nino's for many years originally for their bread and desserts but more recently for their pizza, hot table and gelato.  The food quality and taste at all their locations is generally excellent but the problem at this particular location is always the service.  Service is always slow and the waitresses take forever to take your order.  Even after you have received your food, you can't get the attention of any waitress to refill your drinks because they are all yacking behind the counter!  To top it all off, most of the bench seating is severely cracked and full of holes.  I totally blame the management for all these issues because they are ultimately responsible for the staff and service.  Great food but horrible service!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch here as well as desserts a few times. The cupcakes and cakes are delicious, and I really wish I had room to eat more. Although I feel like I'm paying a bit too much for what I'm getting. The pizzas are pretty good, but the layout is perplexing, as others have mentioned below. You eat in different areas if you order different things and there are multiple places that you pay. I think if it was more organized or clear as to where you're supposed to go, it'd be a whole lot better."}
{"text":"Close to home and very convenient for small necessities like bread, deli, and much more.    There is a hot foods counter but nothing special really.  There is a bar as well.  I'm sure there are many things I have yet to discover.    This place always appears to be busy with people coming in and out at all times.   Lots of Italian products and imported goods.   Can't forget the sweets counter.   Ample seating very simple and straightforward layout of the place making everything easy to find.    Glad to have one in the neighborhood because it's probably one of the best."}
{"text":"There is no comparison to the one on Toro Road, haven't been to the one in Vaughan, but judging by the comments, it appears to be another knock off of the real deal.  These places shouldn't hold the same name if they aren't the same.  As for this one, it's truly a joke.  The food is not authentic by any means.  The bakery can pass but if you decide to eat it at the restaurant it costs you more than if you buy it to take out.  Unfortunately there's not many options in this area for 'Italian food' and therefore this place packs people in.  Too bad, another shame to real Italian food.  They wouldn't survive in Woodbridge, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Pizza is fantastico! Just make sure u ask for it well-done! This is as gourmet authentic Italian pizza as you can get."}
{"text":"Just a place for coffee and something else....Great coffee....great pastries and a great steam table all at resonable prices. Consistent for many many many years....and don't forget the bread and pizzas....."}
{"text":"Fantastic bread, pastries and cakes too.  We order cakes for all of our special occasions.  Great place for a quick espresso and cannoli.  You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"This was my favourite place for gelato near us but today my husband bought cake and it was mouldy. He went back to return and they reluctantly gave him a refund and were not apologetic nor did they apologize to him. This is a health and safety concern that they would keep baked goods out so long that it moulded. They also did not immediately throw out the cake."}
{"text":"Very bad service visited two times and was disappointed from their manners and their prices for what they are offering..."}
{"text":"Was driving north on Yonge Street not knowing for sure what I wanted. Passing Nino, I remembered a promise to.myself to check out their Veal sandwich because it was eons ago from the last one I had from their Wellington location in Aurora. This spot has been around for quite a while, and even on a Friday afternoon it was pretty busy. This is a place where you can grab a Heineken and a snack and have a causal conversation inside or on their well appointed patio. Inside, you have many different 'stations' depending on what you want; such as Gelato, hot plate, sliced meats and premium Italian pastry.   Honestly, this is a nice looking place. Sopranos has nothing on the Italian vibe here. Everything looks authentic. Why not have a cappuccino and a biscotti after your lasagna? So, the negative reviews here don't really add up to what is being offered. In terms of service, it is a cafeteria style, so I would not have an expectation of anything more than a quick service approach. This is a busy place, and service does not appear to be a priority over the food prep. Which is fine, because they do not portend to be anything more than that. Truly, it's a great vibe.   For today, I grabbed a Veal sandwich which come with your peppers and mushrooms and extra sauce for about $8.00. What a huge sandwich. I split it with the little guys and it was enough for both of us. Delicate veal, fresh baked bread and roasted peppers. Come on, you can't get much better than that. From end to end I think I was in there for less than ten, which is pretty fast.   So remember, come for the he food, not the service as it does seem more of a quick service. But you'll definately enjoy it, especially if grabbing a coffee and a sweet treat. Whose counting calories?"}
{"text":"Came here with my co-workers for lunch on a Sunday. As I walked in, I was surprised to find a restaurant/mini-mart/bakery/deli/cafe all wrapped up in this hidden gem.  Nino D'Aversa Bakery offers staple Italian hot foods, served with Italian soda/drinks. Some I've never seen, but tempted to try them all!  There is a nice patio outside, but there is limited seating. With the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and a wide selection of mini-sweets/pastries, it's an inviting atmosphere to hang out and enjoy. There is also a comprehensive selection of Gelato flavours. You can mix several flavours in your bowl if you request it.   Definitely recommended for an afternoon out in this busy little Italian cafe."}
{"text":"Not the warmest reception for newbies with questions but the staff seem to treat the regulars well.  System is definitely confusing to a newcomer. You order your dessert (there are no prices posted and many of the items are not marked so you have to ask what they are) and espresso drinks at one counter then if you're dining in,  you pick up your order at another counter then have a seat. When you are done, you leave your dirty dishes at the table, you tell the cashier what you had and pay on your way out.  I had a cappuccino and a chocolate cream puff. The bitter dark chocolate ganache (chocolate glaze) contrasted well with the flaky pastry and the light chocolate cream filling which was not overly sweet. The cappuccino was strong and paired well with the dessert. On my way out I sampled the Tiramisu gelato,  it was way too sweet for my taste.  This place is open till 11pm every day, popular with the locals, with a high noise level from all the different conversations going on around you. Now that I know the vibe of the place and how the system works, I'm hoping my next visit will be more pleasant."}
{"text":"I have to say I was NOT prepared for how amazing this place was. This place is highly underrated!! It's half Italian grocery store and half Italian diner. I wasn't blown away by the selection of grocery goods but then I got to the bakery. I watched as the gentleman next to me spoke Italian beautifully, casually ordering a splendor of classic confectionery goodies. That certainly set a little Euro-mood & atmosphere for me which added to the experience I was about to embark on. And by \"experience\" I mean my taste-buds being obliterated by the pastry samples offered to me followed by a fresh pasta sample. I really liked the way they offered me a small taste before purchasing and without asking - it just felt very \"New York\" market to me. Then when I tasted the food I just felt like I was transported away to some breezy bistro on the coast of Italy where I was tasting the most authentic freshly housemade alfredo pasta with cheese filling - so worthy of the 5 lbs of fat I will likely gain over the next week :) I have no regrets!  Highly recommended: -Butter tarts!!! -Chocolate & regular cannolis & cream pastries $2.25-$2.50 each. They make for a great midnight snack especially at a dinner/house party. I'm convinced that sharing the cannolis amongst the group late last night led to a few accidental romances tee hee.  -Pepperoni pizza slice ($2.75 + tax). Wrapped in aluminum foil, the slice is kept warm and greasy and in this case that is everything you want. It was soooo good & simply flavored but just perfect and another indulgence worthy of fattening your rear posterior. Update: a lil tip, the pizza is best eaten right away. Crust seems to harden after an hour. -Minestrone soup - housemade with love :) small size is $5 + tax -Daily pasta - today's was fresh cheese-filled ravioli blanketed under a heavy rose-alfredo cream sauce. The pasta is up there with the best pastas I've tried in all of Toronto & GTA. The small pasta plate is $5 + tax. -Calamansi juice from St. Maarten is available (large box $2.25 + tax). Also on-site, a full bar stocked with spirits, liqueurs, beers & wine.  -Final total: $26.57!!  To try: -Macarons are a plenty & look so inviting -the closed cannolis with flakier crust (about two types I wanted to try) -tiramisu (offered in the kitchen area)  So again, I highly recommend checking this spot out. It's a perfect casual spot to bring friends or family out of town for a bite to eat or to impress your date/colleagues with your great taste in food :) They will thank you, although...their waistlines may not.  P.S. I broke my rules and wasn't able to take a photo of the above-described food. It was simply that good - it was almost impossible to think of anything else but how good the food smelled/looked/tasted & I lost track & forgot about the pics. Shame I didnt take a picture of everyone devouring the cannolis at our drunken party last night...now that would have been the best advertisement for Nino's ever made. Hopefully I'll be able to post some great food porn in the future."}
{"text":"If there was an option of giving a rating less than 1, I would definitely have given a negative rating. On Mother's day, I bought 6 pastries for my whole family. I was originally bought 5 but they told me to buy six so that I could receive some discount. Then we sat down on a table and then started eating. Then the manager comes and to leave the store... She said we had a take out box so we could not eat it in the store?!!? But there was no take out menu for the pastries and we were not even asked if it was to go or not. They just gave this cardboard box and that was it! Anyway, below average pastries and worst customer service! Even people around me thought it was very rude for the manager to act like that. Thanks Nino for ruining Mother's Day..."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now - both times for takeout lunch and once as well for the bakery section.  The baked goods - pastries, cakes, etc are pretty good.  I got a mixed box of 6 small treats for a birthday which was a good gift.  The place itself is actuallynice inside - surprisingly big and clean and has lots of tables to sit and eat.  There is a small pizza area.  Looks like thin crust pizza but haven't tried them yet.  There is a selection of items to get - pastas; rice balls, veggies, steak, rice.  You can get 1 main and 2 sides which will set you back $11.  You do get a LOT for this price...to be honest I could eat my lunch for lunch, dinner and maybe breakfast!  Today I got the rice, steak and the gnocchi.  Wasn't impressed with the gnocchi, it was kinda gummy and wasn't impressed with the sauce.  The rice was a bit dry and the steak was ok.  Not sure I will be back for the meals...but the desserts for sure!  They even had gelato but of course it was waaaay too cold to try that today!"}
{"text":"This review Is spicy ciabatta bread specific   I love this bread I think about it all the time powdery crust soft insides with bits of love it's like a meal all on its own! They also sale a good shave cream just don't put the two together"}
{"text":"Dont think I'll be going back. Not the best gelato in town for sure and the worst part was the service. Very pushy sales staff. Also veryyy stingy when it comes to giving gelato samples. I asked to get sample of just one gelato flavor and she made it sound as if she is doing me a favor and how they don't typically give out samples."}
{"text":"Nino d'Aversa is an Italian bakery and market selling pizzas, pasta, various types of breads, Italian cookies and sweets, and deli. The deli and breads are always great, but the sweets tend to be less reliable. I've tried cannolis on a few occasions, they're always a bit soggy. The price is a bit higher than what I'd expect from other Italian bakeries. Overall a pretty good experience when you stick to the coffee (this is the real stuff) and savoury food."}
{"text":"This is a standard suburban Italian eatery/bakery.   The food is good, but as another reviewer said, \"not amazing\". The portions are decent. Most of the entree and side dishes are utterly drenched in oil, even the vegetables (so the calorie count is unnecessarily hiked).  The bakery offerings are above-average, but not outstanding. Like I said, this is a standard suburban Italian eatery."}
{"text":"Only good thing in this bakery, is their gelato and open patio. That's the only reason we come here. Their warm food items and parties aren't fresh. I wouldn't recommend eating any of it...only the pizza they bake to order is fresh."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC! Every bite is *PURE* PERFECTION! It's humble interior masks literally *the* best Italian food you could possibly find!"}
{"text":"I love panettone. The non Italian, like me, might wonder how good could cake in a box possibly be? But if you hang around with enough Italian friends eventually one of these babies will wind up in the work kitchen or as a stocking stuffer. Fluffy, moist, lemony, with a packet of powdered sugar that's twice as sweet as sugar, twice as good as salt. And if you get hooked, baby, it's nobody else's fault, so don't do it!   If you wait all year to drink egg nog and eat Italian boxed Christmas cake, Nino D'aversas offers an amazing wide selection. Way better than Loblaws and even better than Galati.  This incarnation of Nino D'aversas is just off Keele, just south of Finch. It's smack in the middle of a strip of light industrial places. You'd probably never even know this place was here (thank you subway construction on Finch forcing me to use side roads!).  As other reviewers note, it's quite sizable. Great location to zip in and out of on your way to work."}
{"text":"Wait, where am I? I thought I was in an Italian bakery, but it seems I am in the Philippines! What happened here? Its just not the same as it once was. I came for lunch, but the food looked dried out and old with lots of flies buzzing around! No thanks. The staff was unfriendly and they were all speaking Filipino. I decided against the lunch table and walked over to the espresso bar and waited, and waited...after a good 5 minutes, a skinny rather irritated man walks over and rudely said \"yes'?? I was like, well, never mind then, and walked out.   What happened to this place??? I was there years ago and it was an authentic Italian bakery with a friendly atmosphere and lots of people ready to serve you.   I recently visited the Vaughan location (across from Vaughan Mills) and there is just no comparison. Its a shame these people ruined a once, great bakery. :("}
{"text":"Nice bakery.. loved the pizza and cakes.. nice and friendly staff.. prices are ok not too pricey."}
{"text":"Came for pastries because I'm a pastry monster...and was in the area.  I got a tiramisu, custard tart, sfogliatella and a cannoli.  Cannoli was huge, I even saved half for the next day.  It was also pretty good for a pre-filled cannoli.  Lots of ricotta.  I know pre-filled cannoli's are a no no in cannoli world.  The four items came to a total of $10.17.  There are no prices or labels marked so you kinda just have to go for it or ask about everything.  Tiramisu was very good.  Good balance of cream and cake.  Cake was nice and soft.  No flavours were too overbearing. Sfogliatella was yuck.  Some people might like this, but it is not for me.  I did not enjoy the orangey ricotta filling.  If it was a plain cream or ricotta I would have enjoyed it more. My bf finished this one off. Like I said, some people like that and also there was no descriptions, so I just went for it.  Custard was nothing special.  Probably tastes better super fresh out the oven.  I would not purchase again."}
{"text":"Horrible pricing, bad attitude of staff as they are not interested in their customers, $5+ for a medium sized machine made latte is a complete joke. Also looks like they don't make their own bread on site as I had to wait until they unloaded the truck. I don't understand the point of having a bakery & not making your own bread"}
{"text":"Was really disappointed with the take out pizza  It was very under cooked and had a very doughy taste I would not recommend there takeout pizza"}
{"text":"They do Not let you seat during lunch time for coffee and desserts. So DON't go during lunch time. My family went there in this cold weather but the staff did not even say \"sorry\" but \"are you gonna have desserts? Then all seats are reserved and you gotta leave\". HOWEVER ONLY 2 out of 20 tables are filled with single individual. Never want to go back!!"}
{"text":"The Desserts and Choices are Incredible...I am no Stranger to Eating Great Food and baked goods, and this one hit the Mark. Purchased Canolli' s and pastries for a family gathering and my guests loved them!"}
{"text":"I only come here on Sunday mornings for coffee and a pastry but it's well worth the visit for that. The coffee is what I'd call \"Italian cafe\" meaning it's better and more authentic than Starbucks but not as good as a true indie coffee shop. Very nice nonetheless, just not the absolute best if you're an indie coffee nut.   Good selection of Italian pastries and lots of food, hot table, etc  that looks good but I've never tried it."}
{"text":"We were up near Vaughan Mills the other day and happened to notice this bakery. So we stopped in for a coffee and something sweet.  Well -- we will definitely be back. Great cappuccino and love the pastries. All kinds of cakes and cookies. ...and OMG the Zeppole -- to die for!  I had the one with the ricotta and bing cherries.  Talk about yummy.   I also bought some of the cookies -- they have those little crescents with the nuts on and the ones with cherries dotted on them.  They have that wonderful slightly chewy (read ground almonds included) consistency and nutty flavor.  I also picked up some ciabatta buns that are so fabulous for veal sandwiches or can be cut and made into toast (makes the best toast ever!).  We looked around and noticed lots of folks having the pizza -- we will be back to try that out next time!  Yum!"}
{"text":"I reviewed this place as a bakery.  We had eaten there several times and the hot table food was not bad.  Last night, however, we stopped there on the way to a movie and it was execrable.  Chicken parmesan tasted like it was cooked several days before and was like shoe leater.  Pasta was mushy and overcooked.  To top it off, the counter staff was brusque and rude.  OK to buy bread if in the area; no more for their food service!  Please note I am writing this after a catastrophic ice storm.  It is understandable that a place may have issue when the power just comes back.  But if food is in shortage, it is better to not serve anything than to serve stale leftovers, unless the customer is forewarned that the quality is not good."}
{"text":"Took my 5 yr old in for her first cannoli. Ive never in  my life felt so unwelcome. The couple beside us were shocked as well. The young girl behind the pastry counter told us she would be  \"right there\" in a tone that said we were an annoyance. The lady behind the hot table could be seen rolling her eyes at someone while they asked what side options they had. We were there about 10 mins and still never did get served. Will NEVER be back. People like these do not belong in customer service"}
{"text":"Tried some of the desserts here.  Pecan caramel cheese cake - tasted okay but nothing worth commenting on. Red Velvet cake - tasted dry and days old at least. Eclair - I think they used dark chocolate and so it had a more bitter taste to it.  I think all this came to over $14 taxes in. Not worth it. I'm sure their ice cream and coffee's are much better but dessert was a failure."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, mainly for dinner.  I have found the food to always be fresh and tasty. The portions are generous and, if you wish, you can have beer or wine with your meal. The beer is always cold and the wine very smooth and aromatic. Bread rolls are complimentary as are lemon wedges if you wish to top your greens or chicken.  Desserts are fantastic. Whether gelato or pastry, they are fresh and decadent. Coffee is made with fresh ground beans. Espresso long is my favourite.  The restaurant is very clean. Management takes great pride in providing a welcoming, friendly and cozy environment ideal for families. There are floor to ceiling windows everyone providing a light, airy atmosphere.  There is ample parking and the location is quite convenient."}
{"text":"Fresh! Prices are average. Lots of Italian pastry selection! My regulars: fresh buns, almond croissant and lobster tail pastry"}
{"text":"Good selection of hot plates, cafeteria style Italian eatery, nice sized portions, on the expensive side, tastes pretty good esp the meatball sub"}
{"text":"I want to like this restaurant / bakery... I really do but I don't think I'll be going back. The first time I came here, I ordered a pizza made fresh and infront of me. For $13, it was a good price and easily fed 3 people. Anyways taste for pizza I give them a 3/5. Mostly because while flavourful and fresh, the dough had no flavour and was thin and limpy. Kind of sad.   Second time around I ordered the veal parm with cheese dinner including two sides - pasta and baked potatoes. I also ordered a meatball sandwhich. First off, the veal parm was a good size, tasted okay, pasta was a bit salty and potatoes were dry. The garlic bread I added on was hard and stale. Very disappointing. The meatball sandwhich comes with tomato sauce, mushrooms, and onions. The two meatballs it came with were well sized and filling but it had a slightly weird taste to it. Almost like it was going bad. And it was only a few pieces of the meatball though not all of it. The other piece was tasty but the first piece ruined the experience. The mushrooms were fantastic.   I can't say I won't ever give this place another shot. They also have some baked goods, cakes, pastries, gelato, baked bread... but because of inconsistent experience and far misses, I'm, really not rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the nice server we have, this place wouldn't even deserve one star. All we ordered was two pizzas. Basic cheese, and pepperoni. The waitress kept checking in on the \"chefs\" but after waiting almost an hour and watching them talk and flirt with the servers the entire time, we finally got our pizzas. They were decent, but most good places now make equal or better.  Just isn't worth the wait. Some staff are nice and helpful, but some just don't care...  We almost walked out. Twice."}
{"text":"The worst pizza I have ever had! Huge disappointment. Do not get fooled by their wood-burning oven & menu claims. This review is for the Thornhill location on Yonge Street. The menu claims 'Fresh Mushrooms'... The mushrooms were from a can! A can!! Are u kidding me! Disgusting! No wonder they don't offer fresh garlic... Bc the ingredients aren't fresh! I ordered extra tomato sauce & the pizza came w barely any sauce. It didn't matter since the pizza was inedible from the canned mushrooms. And to top it off, the price was $28 plus tax! I have no prob paying high prices for gourmet pizza... I love pizza. But really... $28 for canned mushroom on a pizza served not how was ordered. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Italian? Umm, nope, not even close.   We ordered food from the \"hot\" table, but when we finished picking out our 3 small items shoved into a bowl, the woman turned and put it into a microwave! Its no wonder the potatoes tasted dry and flavorless, the peas were uncooked and the gnocchi were a salty mess of cold dumplings.  10.00/plate and a free side of Filipino attitude.  Horrible experience."}
{"text":"You don't visit Nino for service, you pretty much only go to Nino for their desserts.   I've already reviewed the Vaughan location and still stand by my comments. Their desserts are where it's at. Today I went in for 8 cannolis to go. I also asked for a small cup of water because I spilled espresso on my jeans. I was told \"no\" and that if I had dined in I could get the water. I laughed, thinking this young man was cracking a joke because tap water is such a simple request. When I grabbed my box and receipt, he wished me a good day without the cup of water. Tf? K thanks? While I was waiting in line to order, I heard two servers come storming in behind the dessert counter and complain how busy and chaotic it is. Sorry that I'm contributing to the craziness?   2 stars because the desserts are unbeatable but the service is pure dog crap."}
{"text":"1/5 for service 2.5/5 for lunch 4.5/5 for dessert  Visited this establishment for lunch during the summer a few times and was really impressed by their dessert display. Gelato, tarts, cannolis, oh the cannolis!   Lunch: On one occasion I had a stuffed pepper - it was alright, nothing to rave about. I recall being extremely thirsty after so it must've been salty. Another time I had a fresh bun with sliced deli meats. That wasn't bad. I did have to wait a long time for assistance at the deli counter. Like, a very long time. I actually had to approach the lady on cash to find me someone and that was after I chased a girl around the dessert counter. She always conveniently walked to the other side of the counter when I approached, even after intense eye contact. Not cool.  What I really, really want to talk about is the cannolis. SO GOOD. They are just SOOOO good. I will forever be sold on them and stay faithful until proven otherwise. To be honest, I've been eating cannolis from a bakery in Scarborough and have always thought cannolis were made to be saugy. And because I ate them so often this way, I just thought that was the norm. At Nino's, I discovered they are supposed to be crispy. I died and went to crispy, cheesy, deliciously sweet heaven.  Nino D'aversa Bakery makes the best cannolis. Period."}
{"text":"Wow, with 3 locations in the GTA -  how had I never heard of this place before?   Some coworkers suggested lunch here. I expected a small, italian sandwich shop. I couldn't believe how huge this place is! Half of it is a cafeteria-style restaurant. Sandwiches, pizza, made to order, salads, chicken, fish, rice balls, espressos and a full bar. I went with the rice ball platter. This is a cheese-filled, fried ball of rice smothered in tomato sauce. So good! The platter also comes with 2 veggies of choice. I picked baby carrots and cauliflower. They were both hot, nicely cooked and well seasoned. My coworkers all got veal sandwiches, I have never had veal, but I'll take their word that it was good. The sandwiches were gigantic, and stuffed with cooked peppers and mushrooms, loaded with sauce. They were all very happy.   I'm sure if you get a sandwich here, you are guaranteed a good time, because they bake their own fresh bread and it is amazing. I know this, because the other half of Nino D'aversa is set up like a bakery/small grocery store, where you can get all kinds of imported and local ingredients to stock your pantry full of italian goods. The bakery has fresh baked bread and every kind of italian dessert you could think of. I brought home some rolls, garlic bread, canolli, and eclairs. Everything was excellent, but I clearly bought too much for our 2-person family. Next time I won't be so gluttonous... I hope.   Oh, the only reason I subtracted a star is because everyone working here seems so rushed. They are clearly very busy, but I felt I was bothering them just to pay for my food."}
{"text":"Eggplant parmesan is amazing!! This is more of an eatery than a bakery - sit down style, but the hot table is really great!"}
{"text":"Summary: You cannot trust my review of this place. I am too biased. This place is very close to my heart.  Pros: They are extremely nice and give me a welcoming feeling; Even though it's a bakery, they have about 10 tables inside where you can eat, drink or just talk to your friends; they sell: * - decent coffee and pastries * - warm dishes for lunch or dinner * - bakery goods (DA-A) * - good ice cream * - pizza  Cons: Food is not the greatest and prices are probably higher than they could be :). Together with that they always have many customers and often busy  Details: I was living close to this place and often visited them with my friends  on weekends. Employees know me and remember my son since he was 3 years old. Lately, I have been booking a hotel close to them and it became a good spot for grabbing quick lunch. We have never been disappointed or unhappy with their services or hospitality.  Last time I ordered sausage with rice and veggies. Sausage was too salty for me, rice was too plane and veggies were completely overcooked. Maybe next time I will go with chicken :)."}
{"text":"Friday night.... in the mood for Pizza ..... wood burning stove. We ended up at Nino's., in Aurora. We parked in the back, lots of space. We were seated in a nice booth and given time to pursue the menu. You had a choice of 6 different pizzas or you can makeup your own. I ordered the Quattro Stagione and my husband made his own personal size pizza. I found my pizza to be a bit dry and bland but my husbands was very tasty. Crust is thin the way I like it. Nino's offers a hot table if delicious Italian food, cold cut sandwiches, pastries and ice cream. Been here many times and the bakery is always busy. A relaxed atmosphere and nice staff make it a win win to drop in for a cappuccino and dessert."}
{"text":"With my sharp-tongue and sweet tooth it is very difficult being impartial and critique a dessert/ice cream/coffee/gelato/pizza joint. Service was very good with a polite waitress whom was patient and pleasant but slow as heck. My Connoli; Available with either cream or ricotta cheese was amazing as one would expect in these neck of the woods. It was delicious and creamy; a little bland however. On a side note; The pastry crust was not so crunchy, slightly mushy and very slightly stale.    To add to the sin; Hot cho-co-lat; Atypical to the traditional thick creamy chocolatey Hot Chocolate, was light, not-so-chocolately, and slightly watery compared to the norm- lovely drinking experience all the same. Except that the drink was a misnomer as neither was it hat hat nor maximally \"chocolatey\". I loved it  nonetheless primarily due to the reduced sugar, low viscosity and \" hat but-not burning temperature. A nice cozy place to chat."}
{"text":"My first time in there and never, ever again.  The most miserable, nasty, hostile, rudest customer service imaginable (cheese counter).  With this obnoxious \"customer service\", it is a miracle to me that people even want to shop here.  I still like Nino D'Aversa on Keele Street.  They do it right at that location.  This place needs to learn from the Keele Street location what customer service really means."}
{"text":"Had my perfect piece of pie - vegetarian pizza - thin crust - crispy, slightly dark on the edges.  Good quality oregano and drizzled with just the right amount of olive oil (quality).  Perfectly roasted peppers.  Gorgeous.  Deli counter spotless - and quality."}
{"text":"So hot food wise, steer clear! I have tried on two separate occasions their 'ready prepared' meals and they are just a mess, usually cold, not tasty - just save your money.   However, I love coming here to shop for some groceries, they have a really neat selection of italian foods and a great deli. They have a large variety of cheeses, pastas, bread, and they're all great quality. Their pastries are also quite delicious and beautiful. The people are always friendly as well."}
{"text":"Sick of the north Yonge congestion, i decided to get off Yonge and go to Nino to regroup for a coffee and something small.   I was pleasantly surprised to see that the place has been renovated and expanded.  The place is a little bare from the expansion, but needless to say, they still have the same products. Things that I love picking up from here - Italian \"Manwhiches\", truffle olive oil, pistachio gelato, bitter iced coffee's.   I did note however that since the expansion, prices have increased slightly, but not by much. A quarter here and there. Worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Even if it was half-way good of what i expected it to be,i would give a passing score but naw... I don't like to buy stuff everyday so i bought 2 big boxes of mixture of various cakes,cookies, eclairs,etc...Almost everything on the cake section. They looked good too and when i came home i realized they only look good. It is nowhere close to any kind of Italian food... Price was around $100 and they do use better quality products indeed; however, i think they need to change their whoever is preparing it... Also, woman with the glasses(Asian,40s,50s) was very slow when preparing my order and instead of making it 3 separate boxes based on the content, she stuffed them all in 2 boxes(Way to go sister, you saved 5 cents).  Also, she was rude to another customer when she asked for something. She could have politely said, \" as soon as i finish....\" but she said something like \"i am working on an order\" in a rude tone... Gelatos looked good but i won't be going there as have read someone in this page mentioning the same thing about gelatos, looks good,tastes like a regular boxed ice cream..."}
{"text":"Out of all the Nino DaVersa Bakeries, this is the worst location! Most staff have no clue what their doing except the nice little nonna who cuts all my deli meats. Had a great conversation with her .   Took three staff members to check me out the one day including the manager, found this a little pathetic and slow. The Manger I found a little weird and inappropriate.   I'm huge fan of pizza, and this location did not do it for me, the dough was actually tasteless and same with the sauce and cheese, not a Margarita pizza I was expecting ESPECIALLY for an \"Italian bakery\".    WAY WAY overpriced, don't go in there buying dough because it's up marked $5 go to your local grocery store and buy the SAME dough by Nino for $2.    Their desserts aren't bad at all, I won't lie.   If your looking for a good bakery all around, don't go to this place, take the extra 10-15 min drive to Richmond hill and check out \"Old Bread Mill\" you won't be disappointed at all!"}
{"text":"This place can do no harm in my eyes, because it's so close to home and minutes away from my go-to cappuccino for $3.45, Tim Hortons is $3.15 overpriced and you're lucky if you don't end up with a mouthful of foam.  They sell lottery tickets on site which will one day lead to me winning the lotto max jackpot after I take one slurp of their delicious hot drink here, and then I'm going to have to buy the place and call it Nino D'Bianca!! Dreaming is cheap, but caffeine shouldn't be when you appreciate the kick it gives after the first sip.  Gelato selection is heaven for when you've got the craving for the cold, or when you do for the hot, they've got lasagna to cure rainy days and our ever-growing clamor in life that disappear once you walk through the door.  Order and pay at the three different counters and choose your seat and away you go while you indulge in some goodies stuffed with sweetened filling of whipped ricotta..AHhhhh the delectable cannoli. Another reason why my waistline outgrows my desire to learn how to play tennis this summer, but that is besides the point!  This is the neighbourhood sweet tooth mobster and a squad of devotees who remain loyal to Nino D'Aversa's reason in landmarking its territory with great rep."}
{"text":"I was craving something spicy, so I decided to get a spicy wooden pizza from here. I've had it before, so I knew I was going to get my fix.  I couldn't find a pizza menu online anywhere, as they mainly serve hot dishes that you choose once you're inside the store. I decided to call to get the info. The spicy pizza is called inferno and it has spicy Italian sausage, hot peppers and cheese. The personal size is 12.50 and the large 24 I believe. I ordered takeout.  My pizza was ready in about 10 minutes! It was actually a lot bigger than I thought it would be. The crust is thin and delicious. The pizza it most definitely spicy (yum!).   I also got 3 single servings of gelato - chocolate, vanilla and hazelnut. Their gelato is super good, so I'm all around happy with this meal!   I definitely recommend trying their pizza. It's flavourful and not high on dough."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for coffee and some pastries after having lunch. We wanted to spend some more quality family time before my parents went back to work. When we walked in we were told that we couldn't even sit down because it was lunch hour. The manager told us that they could not seat us is if we weren't eating lunch even though 75% of the tables were EMPTY. Everybody who worked there were extremely rude and this visit completely ruined our experience. It's a shame because the pastries looked really delicious. Overall, I'm never going there again"}
{"text":"Nino D'Aversa Bakery is a cool concept. There is a few different counters to order from, an eating area with a few tables and groceries. The sandwiches were good, the coffee wasn't my favourite. I've had way better Italian coffee. The chocolate eclairs were great! This would be the only reason why I would return. I still think about them and visited this bakery a few weeks ago. I would only return for the eclairs and maybe to try the gelato as I didn't get a chance last time."}
{"text":"This bakery also has a small store and a cafe side where you can order food to eat or to go. We just came in to look around. My parents bought some biscotti as none of the pastries in the display case looked appetizing to us. There were only two people running the bakery side of the shop. It wasn't that busy on a Sunday afternoon so we were seen to promptly. I'll have to come back and try their pastries some other time."}
{"text":"Funny, I have driven by this place more often than I can count and always thought it was an industrial bakery. Then I thought they had walk in service for baked goods...then I walked in!!  To my pleasant surprise this was like a one stop shop of a variety of Italian foods. There is a bakery for breads, deserts, and pastries. Then there is gelato, brick pizza oven, hot foods, and a cafe!  I had a cappuccino and biscotti today as I have just come from a dim sum restaurant next door, but I plan on coming back to explore more.  Unfortunately, the cappuccino was a little on the bitter side like the lady that served me. Honestly my cappuccino machine at home makes better brew.  So far....3/5 for the pleasant surprise, but will have to review again after further trial of their food."}
{"text":"I brought my car in to the dealership close by a couple of Fridays ago, so I looked up on Yelp to see what would be open at 8 AM.  I'd been to the Thornhill location of D'Aversa Bakery with mixed feelings so I decided to give this one a try.  When I arrived at the door it was already 8:10AM, but the door would not slide open. After about 30 seconds the lady came to the door and apologized that they had forgotten to unlock it.   I asked if they had breakfast and they did.  The service was slow but it wasn't a priority for me.  The lady serving me was very nice although the service was discombobulated and inconsistent.  After all, it was really early.  The food was okay, nothing special but the service was much better than that of the location on Yonge Street.  In the end, it was nothing special but not a place I'd avoid."}
{"text":"I've become a regular out of convenience however there is room for improvements.   Bread is better than average but there is something missing Good selection of imported Italian items... May items that's I forgot existed but love! Deli counter has a variety of items but make sure you tell them how you want it cut or they will make it too thin or too thick (I'm picky lunge that though) Pastries are good.....have the cannoli! Pizza is alright... if they didnt have the wood burning oven it would be mediocre  Hot table items change everyday with a few staple items like the veal. I tried the veal sandwich and it's bland.... even with cheese do I'm not impressed Coffees are good as long as the older women make it Staff - some are great while others are...how should I put it??... unprofessional.  I've stood there listening to employees b*tch about other staff members or their schedules with no shame while I'm waiting for my coffee or whatever.  Do that in the back, away from the customers.  Well I still come here? Yes it's a good place overall but like I said, some improvements need to be made"}
{"text":"Always great pizza & pasta, owner is super friendly and always remembers us when we come in.  Couldn't be happier with this joint!"}
{"text":"My father has a place right by Nino and mentioned that I should try it out. Though I go there often, it's more for convenience than anything else. The food is honestly hit or miss. Sometimes I go and am met with amazing chicken parmesan, other times my dish is cold and thrown together. There is always a line up which means they must be doing something right, though waiting in said line can be rather frustrating.  Their desserts seem to be a consistently good, every time I have had one I have been very pleased. They are well priced and worth the money. The lunches and dinners are rather expensive given the amount/quality that you receive, and every time I have eaten breakfast there it has been a disaster. Twice I received burnt scrambled eggs (a dish that is fairly difficult to mess up) and had to throw them out.  I do go here for lunch fairly often, their sandwich bar is good and the lady behind the counter is always extremely nice and outgoing. All in all, Nino is an average bakery, nothing more, nothing less. If you go, get some gelato!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for years to eat the best Margerita Pizza, loaded with fresh Basil and baked to perfection!    However, when I visited a few weeks ago I had the worst Pizza's I've ever eaten.  Tasteless cardboard crust with burned crumbs / debris under it.  The fresh Basil was replaced with some dry facsimile of basil (possibly oregano). The new \"Pizza Chef\" didn't even know what he had put on the pizza, and brought me the bowl to SEE what he used.  Ohh and this was after making the wrong pizza to start with. Sighhh.    Please bring back the Indian Chef from Aurora... He's a Pizza Guru!!  On the bright side, the servers are still as sweet & lovely as ever... And the deserts are heavenly"}
{"text":"My friend and I went there after eating food in the plaza at around 8:30PM. That was when they were preparing to close. I noticed how they have a large amount of desserts showcased. I got their macarons (hazelnut and pistachio), both were deliciously not too sweet but sweet enough!"}
{"text":"What is Nino D'Aversa? Cafe, bakery, deli, gelateria or mini-mart? There are so many distractions here and my inner fatty and I can loiter here all day long. There are too few places up north with the atmosphere of Nino. I usually grab a latte with a cannoli or two. Sometimes I get the tiramisu. I recently tried their gelato and the pistachio was pretty good. They don't have the nicest staff at this location but I like cannoli."}
{"text":"I used to like this place a few years back before they did the renovation.  Now the service sucks, food is bad (serves me right for going to a bakery for hot food), desserts are nothing special, and even the coffee is not that good anymore.  They should at least half the price, for the quality and service they provide. Is it just me trying to cling onto the good old days?  But reading other people's review suggests not.  Another good place down the drain.  No wonder why Starbucks is at every corner now a days...."}
{"text":"went here over the weekend again, this time we had the pizzas. Definitely can recommend them. nice thin crust done very much like in Italy. prices are not bad considering what your getting, we had a large and added a couple extra toppings and it was about $30 for a LARGE pizza.   in the past we have had the chicken and the veal and they are good, as well as the rapini can't complain. only issue I had with the veal sandwich is the bun is too hard, but that is a personal preference thing."}
{"text":"I took my friend to Nino D'Aversa Bakery for gelato and coffee this afternoon. This place is packed!!   I have to say I like the vibes of this location VS the other one at Woodbridge. I know it is strange to say that since this location is smaller, dated and hardly have any seatings! But the vibes here so much better. This cafe feels like where all the locals people will come here for a quick snack or to hang out..   Small Gelato ($3) - My friend could not decide on which flavours to pick, ended up I just pointed and decide on Tuttobaco (mixed berries) and Torrone (honey, vanilla and almonds) - love the almonds chunks and the real berries inside the gelato.. nice and refreshings!  Caffe Latte and Coffee - love the mugs that they served in.... roast not too strong, great to go with my dessert  Seatings are a little bit cramped and you can hear all the conservations around you.. but hey that's how a busy Italian cafe should feel like! A celebration of life, family and friendship  Free WIFI access!"}
{"text":"I usually come to Nino D'aversa Bakery for a quick coffee break and a pastry.  There are 2 lines one for the hot table and other just for sweets. Nothing too amazing and all the constructions in the area, turning into and out of the plaza can be such a hazzle. I have drove by a few time and did not even bother dropping by again.  There is so many Nino D'aversa locations so I won't bother coming here unless I am in the area."}
{"text":"Nino D'aversa Bakery has this concept of food stations which divide up to Deli, Hot Food, Pizza, Dessert... When I walked in I feel a little bit disoriented... (OK I do get confused easily sometimes..) There are these nice seating area with number on the tables, are these places for sit down menu with wait service or where should I get started?   Hot Plate  - Not much choice as I was here for a late lunch... only veal left and only pasta dish was Ravioli with Cheese. The lady really loaded up my plate with Ravioli and I was forced to eat my veggie too (Mushroom).  I found the Veal warmly cold... the Ravioli is ok though.. I always love any form of pasta..  - The whole wheat bun! oh it is so good... dense and fluffy at the same time.. the best part of my lunch   Desserts and Cookies  - Love the display case of desserts.. they have the regular and mini versions of most of their treats. The mini are $1.50 each, while the cookies are $1.30. The chocolate covered puffs with chocolate mousse filling is A-OK... the mousse so smooth......hmmmm and full of it!! Double chocolate delight!!   I don't think I will be eating another hot plate here at Nino D'aversa Bakery as I really not into eating Cafeteria or buffet style food. On the hand I might be back for some of those cute desserts!"}
{"text":"What is a hot table at an italian rest with no pasta??? Service, well my dinner was supposed to come with a bun so I went back to the hot table and asked for whole wheat and she did not have and told me to go to the bread baskets on the take out side to get my own roll...no plate offered to put it on.   Pretty much felt like I might as well eat dinner at home.  I understand it is not service to the table but I am a regular at the Yonge St location and in comparison this one is far inferior.   So bring your plates, knives and forks and pots and pans to make a meal and this spot is the place for you and your family!"}
{"text":"Great location. Great food.  I work close to here so I sometimes come to buy lunch or after work to get something for dinner.  The food is always delicious and filling, the portions are pretty big. And the pastries are amazing."}
{"text":"I've always come to this place for their gelato but I needed to get something from the plaza so I figured I'd buy lunch here as well. I really that they give the option for full serve dine-in or hot table for those that aren't looking to be serviced.  I had the Parmesan Veal sandwich with mushrooms and I really enjoyed this. It was a bit messy but that's to be expected from saucy sandwiches. I also had the pizza a while back and it was good but not to my personal liking. The gelato had many different selections of flavours and the serve sizes are very generous so if you're looking for a decent amount, the small should be more than enough."}
{"text":"Best italian pastries, coffees, breads,gelato etc. Also the pizzas here are gteat! I would recommend this location over their Vaughan lovation tho."}
{"text":"If you need a birthday cake this the place to go!  Staff is super friendly, will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Havent been here for years. I remember it as a good place to eat with great pastries and desserts. Yeah. Not anymore. Well at least the pastry/ dessert part.   So came on a Saturday early afternoon because I was going to a girlfriends for a baby shower.  I offered to bring something.  I've been to the nino d'aversa in aurora recently so thought I'd give this one a go.  That was a big expensive embarrassing mistake. I spent a lot of money on a box of treats.   To start with it should have been in two boxes but they do everything behind the counter and the lady jammed everything into one box. You don't see until they come around. So she save 50 cents on a 50 dollar order.  Got a box jammed packed with really stale cookies, hard cream puffs, curdled cream in those puffs - they smelled. They actually smelled like rotting milk. Cannolis that were different sizes and soft on the bottom where the grainy old cream soaked through. Well those that were actually filled. Some of them only were filled on the edges. Super.   We called to complain and was told that I was lying and that everything was made in the morning. I'm not sure what morning they were talking about. It wasn't Saturday morning. Maybe Monday or Tuesday judging by the staleness and curdling.   Won't be back."}
