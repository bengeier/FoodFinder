{"text":"Very nice course. Prices are a bit high on the weekends, but f you get a chance you should give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good chicken sandwich, french fries were above average. Chicken wrap for take out was so-so, but I'll definitely be back since its so darn convenient"}
{"text":"I'm not a big golf fan, but all my friends are. Tried to play for like the 5th or 6th time. Still don't like it. But with that said. The course is nice. We went after 4pm so for a round it was only $16. That's great in my book since I didn't want to spend alot for a sport I can't really get into. But be prepared there is a 4pm rush so it might be pretty busy. The course is in between houses and apartments so watch out if you aren't very good. Nice course, very well maintained, and cheap prices after 4pm. As for my golfing days....they are prob over."}
{"text":"This course is a real gem, and not well-known. Course is in great condition, and the greens are fantastic (yes, they are a bit fast). The course plays pretty tight, so you need to drive the ball fairly straight to stay out of traps, or out of the desert areas.  Mid-week traffic is not bad, but prime-time rounds can go 4.5 hours. This course needs a marshal to keep everyone moving. All staff members have been very nice and accommodating each time I have played here (maybe 10 rounds). It is one of my favorite courses in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this golf coarse, great for everyone and has some challenging holes but otherwise not bad."}
{"text":"I've played this course dozens of times and it's usually in extremely good condition.  Played today and the fairways were pretty dried out, first cut along the fairways were very long (difficult to find your ball), clumps of dried grass all over and the greens were patchy. Made mention of it to guy in the pro shop and he didn't care whatsoever.  I'm sure I'll play here again as it's one of my favorite local courses but I hope they take better care of it soon."}
{"text":"Normally we don't play on weekends during our visits to Vegas because its just too crowded, but this past week the courses were pretty empty, even this one.  It was much colder than we are used to in February (50 degrees) but being from Chicago we are okay with the cold.  It was super windy but we stuck it out.  We went out at our 8:08 start time, although there was no starter or announcement and the other 2 that we were suppose to join us were late, so we started ourselves on time.  We paid twice what we normally would have so that was a real bummer but golfing in the winter for Midwesterners is worth the inflated price. This time we completed the 18 holes and played great (couple birdies and a few pars) We'll be back since its so close to the house."}
{"text":"I had a great day here! I rented a new set of M2 clubs from the club house, service was excellent! Temperature was about 45Â° and slightly windy but course played great! From the Teebox to the greens. It was cool to see every hole had a name and a picturesque view! First time ever playing a desert course and it was very enjoyable!       Hats off to everybody at painted desert golf course! I will be back for sure! Thank you very much! I I really don't want to go back to Wisconsin! 1/24/2017"}
{"text":"So after weeks at the driving range I finally decide to play the Painted Desert golf course. I pull up to the first hole in the golf cart and I was blown away. This course is very nice and the greens are in great condition. Every hole seemed to be perfect and I managed to play 18 holes without hitting a house. One of my favorite holes on the course was hole 16 I believe that to be a Par 3 where you must avoid the water. Let's just say I lost a ball or two on that hole. I would definitely play this course again very fair priced courses and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Very nice, pleasant accommodating staff. Golf course is great. Good price for a holiday weekend for out of towners. And....they have coolers with ice on the golf carts - real plus!"}
{"text":"Dissapointed here this time out.  Five hour round stuck with and behind lessons.  Its really not ok to hit three off the tee every hole.  Conditions were fair, greens good but fairways showing some bare spots.  Need to have marshalls to keep pace of play."}
{"text":"Typical par 3 course. Nothing special. Range is small and beat up. Poor maintainence. I was told a bucket was only 4 dollars but the cashiers partner corrected him to be 5 dollars. If this is any indication of how much they are desperate for money then it will tell you how the course is. I would come here when I'm plastered drunk with friends that are even more drunk and I think it would still be boring. Not sure that I'll bee back. This place needs work."}
{"text":"OB Golf Management has enacted dynamic pricing for this course. What this means is the price payed to play this course is much higher than other courses around town. This is a shame since this was my home course for many years. The course itself is nice, and the staff is great, but for the price I could play courses that are much nicer than this."}
{"text":"Roy hooked it up and gave a full round and carts for $25 for early morning. The course was good, but the only thing I noticed was the green looked like there would be a break when you putt but it went straight 9/10 times. Also it has some narrow fairways so make sure you're on point unless you want to hit your ball of rocks and sand. I will definitely try to play there again."}
{"text":"This is a nice course that is so poorly managed it makes you think you're playing a $10.00 muni... not fair to the venue, but when the management doesn't care about the customer that's what happens!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the country club only. I decided to check this place out because we kept getting the flyers in the mail. I figured what the heck, let me go check it out since it was so close to home. I'm glad I did. We came on Sunday morning and the place was almost empty. We sat at a table near the gold course and let me tell you it was absolutely beautiful   Everything on the menu was cheap. Food came out fast the service was spectacular. I will be back to try the other items.   * 10% discount given of you live in the painted dessert communit"}
{"text":"I had one of the most distasteful experiences with a dishonest staff and general manager. I had a 10:38 tee time , at 10:50 I went into the clubhouse and asked the starter how long the delay was going to be , he asked my name and than told me that we were the next group [ I was polite ]. I waited right outside the clubhouse for my name to be called as I was done warming up . No names were called for 22 minutes as I waited and watched 2 more groups go to the tee box , I went into the clubhouse and asked the same young man why we were not called as promised and that 2 groups had went ahead of us since he had told me we were next up. He proceeded to tell me that he had called us to the tee and we did not show up, I explained to him that for the last 22 minutes that I sat in the cart in front of the clubhouse under the speaker and that he did not call anybody during that time. He lied right to my face, I asked for the GM's card and in an arrogant tone told me the GM Ed was right at the end of the counter , I spoke to Ed and told him what happened and that I didn't appreciate being lied to and I was an long time OB card holder and Ed's response was in a sarcastic tone \" Do you want a refund on your cards?\",There was no attempt to explain what had happened or to remedy the situation, just basically telling my friends and I that if you don't like it, Don't come back, like he was doing us a favor letting us play on his golf course. When we spoke to him we were perturbed and upset but there was no yelling or profanity . when we left it became obvious that the 2 groups ahead of us were Ed's buddies and he was probably responsible for the whole situation otherwise the young man at the desk never would have spoken to us in the tone that he used in front of the boss and that his boss never would have allowed it if he wasn't the reason for this situation. In this entire time Ed never addressed any of the issues and just said there had been a frost delay earlier , we said our issue was being lied to . He basically just blew us off. Terrible and unforgivable conduct on the staff's part."}
{"text":"I used a living social voucher in which previous management said they would honor but new management did not.  They shut down the course previously in September while they were fixing the greens.  I had a verbal OK from Mike that is was not going to be an issue but new manager seemed to be hesitant and did not make me whole.  He only gave me the value that I previously paid for and still charged me the difference for a twilight time.  Also made me wait 2 hours as a single player.  I was polite but wanted to see if he ever try to make it right.   Course was fine and the other workers were great.  The manager could have went the extra mile to make me happy but ended up making my weekend sour.  Wont come back.  OB sports management should honor all previous coupons instead of trying to make golfers hurdle.  Its a game of honor and class not feeling like I just walked out of wal-mart."}
{"text":"The course was in good condition. The greens were running at a good speed. Nice set up all in all. If I didn't slice so much today it would have been a great day. Solid golf course all in all. Price is reasonable for locals also."}
{"text":"Poorly run and course is in rough condition. Definitely not worth your time or $$. We arrived early to hit a few balls. No carts available. When we got our cart the cooler was literally hanging off. The starter told us to leave it at a hole when it falls off. Ok back to the game. We went back to the starter about 10-15 minutes before our start time and he told us to go see the kid handling the carts because he was taking over. As the starter continued to socialize with his buddies. Then he jumped back in and started sending golfers out. We asked a 2sum what time their tee time was and it was 15 minutes after us, yet the starter (not the kid) was going to send them before us. That was until we challenged him. That's when we got our dilapidated cart with dangling cooler and then he paired us with another couple. Off we go to hole #1. 3 groups backed up. Perhaps the starter should be at hole #1 to see the pace. It took us 5+ hours that day. Course conditions were awful. Greens were bumpy. The ball bounced it's way to the hole. So we finish up our round and all the restrooms are closed. These people need to visit a few other courses to see what \"good\" looks like in terms of running a course. We golf twice a week year round and definitely won't be back to Painted Desert."}
{"text":"Love this place.   Great garlic fries and they are super fresh.  Pulled pork is awesome and the rueben is very tasty.  Some of the liquor prices are a little high but great atmosphere."}
{"text":"It wasn't as good as I expected ... greens were plenty fast and I had a hard time reading them and judging speed ... will play again when I get a chance ... I have never played this course well"}
{"text":"The painted desert golf club is nothing like I imagined it to be from the name. I expected this golf club to be out north of Las Vegas, near the Piute Counrty club - in the desert. Even the pictures on their website are a bit deceiving. This course winds through the painted desert suburb of Vegas. It is a nice course, a bit narrow at times, but there are touches of the desert to be found on most every hole. It is one of the shorter courses in Las Vegas. It is gentle on the scorecard for the higher handicap players. ..... unless you hit the ball into the houses bordering the course..... It is also a bit gentle on the wallet ... they have some good rates for afternoon tee times. There is water on most of the par threes, making them scenic as well as challenging. A nice place to play - to feel  good about your game. It is a bit of a drive out highway 95..... but your game will come out of here alive"}
{"text":"Another Golf Course tucked away in a neighborhood.....this one is located in the Northwest off of Ann Rd & US 95 North.  I enjoy coming here during the Summer months and can usually get on the course easily mid-week.  On the weekends it tends to get crowded because their green fees are lower than most courses in town.  Here's my breakdown of the course:  PROS - Nice practice facility.  Mats & Grass options, which are nice.  - It's a nice course for a mid to high level handicap player (15+)....because it's a short course (see CONS).  - There are a few challenging holes, (#14, 292 yds, par 4) has water on the right side of the fairway and is a slight dogleg right....if you hit the ball long enough, you could cut the water and come close to driving the hole.  CONS - Short course.  6,781 yds from the tips, 6,269 from the black tees, ladies tees are at 5,647.  - No lights on the practice facility and the range is pretty small.....can get crowded when it's busy.  - The greens are slow.  They're not too challenging.  I've been coming to this golf course for over 17 yrs, since I moved here in '93.....it's like an old friend.  It's a great course to sharpen up your wedge play and 3 wood (off the tee instead of driver).  Or if you're a beginner, it's pretty forgiving.  Will I return?  I'm sure I will."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed with Painted last weekend, or more accurately, the cart attendants. Ended my round but left my sunglasses in the cart. Walked my bag to my vehicle in the parking lot and quickly remembered I left them. Loaded up and parked in the bag drop area. Spoke with the attendants and then promptly checked multiple carts...and of course not to be found. Hey guys, I'm not stupid. I am positive you found them. Great effort sounding concerned and then offering me some cheap ass pair of dirty glasses out a tool bag on your service cart.  I've been playing there for roughly 5+ years and thought your staff had more integrity. Guess not. I'll play closer to home from here on out and thank you for this resounding memory. I'll take my business elsewhere and make certain my fellows players hear my story."}
{"text":"This golf course is very close to where I live and I am glad I learned about it. The price point for 18 holes after 3 pm was a gimme and it included a free domestic beer OMG. The club house is very nice and the pro shop wow...they have NFL team golf bags. Either people who like those teams really buy their bags from this pro shop or somebody got stuck with a bad order. The Steelers? Go Cowboys! :)  On to the course oh did I mention a cart came with this price I felt like I was robbing the place. Tee off was about 10 min early no complaints and at the end of the 1st hole I shot a +1 hey for a duffer like me I was happy now we won't talk about the rest of my game. Although I will mention I birdied HOLE 14! Did I mention I birdied hole 14?   The course is very nice and can't be beat for this price. Wide open fairways although I seemed to somehow find the edges. Every up and down was pretty straight forward and no real major dog legs to speak of or challenging traps/hazards. Short course well maintained and fun for beginners and intermediate players...i.e. most of the general golfing public.   I was a little disappointed with the slow pace of play we ran into people ahead of us a few times and kinda slowed us down. Not a huge problem for me as my golf rhythm is so erratic it doesn't effect my game. Why I should question if you should even call what I do game LOL. Did I mention hole 14 yeah had some birdies hanging around there!  Seriously it was good to be out after haven't being on a course in such a long time and I look forward to going back. Thanks to my buddy who suggested it and greatful for the cigar afterward!"}
{"text":"way too many people on the course.... it takes at least 6 hours to get 18 holes in. no way a golfer can get a rhythm going...which could ruin a more serious golfers game. the course is very nice in the conditions are very good.. but lack of a martial make the course on playable"}
{"text":"First time playing here and for a handicap of 20, did pretty well. (+31)   Greens are super fast, fairways are pretty wide when it comes to driving off the tee box, and if you cant hit your ball straight, most likely you will be saying hello to one of their many sand-traps.  Had the free lunch special that came with the 18 holes ($39) afterwards. Waiting time for all three orders was 20 minutes but then found out one of them was not put in yet because the chef lost the ticket. Who does that? Anyways the extra starving that I had accumulated was worth the wait since i had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich w/ Onion Rings. (check pictures)  Say hi to Maria from the bar for she seems to be quite the entertainer at times;)"}
{"text":"Played there in June 2012 and the fairways are getting a little ratty, with some bald spots and some places with patches of weeds. I was hoping OB Sports, the new owner, was going to improve the shape of this course. So far, I'm not seeing it. The greens though are in good shape.  I also dislike the conditions of the arroyos, which seems to lack any landscaping thought behind them and many patches look like your everyday vacant lot in Clark County. I hope OB Sports will put some effort to improving the visual appeal of these areas.  On the positive side, this clubhouse serves some of the best hot dogs in town. Comes with all of the condiments and fixings. I highly recommend it.  Also, the staff at this course consistently treats golfers with outstanding service and courtesy. I think it's the best in town. It's one reason why I continue to play here, despite some of its shortcomings on the course."}
{"text":"The management has been taken over by OB sports and it is now in great shape. The bar service still needs some improving-by this I mean it's just too damn slow when you are making the turn. The price for twilight is why this place is getting 4 stars from me. $15 golf after 3!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend living here simply because of the lack of compassion and professionalism from management. On top of not being able to get basic deliveries past 5pm and on random holidays I called to see if my elderly parents could visit in their RV for thanksgiving and was quickly turned down by Sheryl at the management office. RUDE and not worth living here."}
{"text":"My first time playing at this course and I didn't know they had special going on when I checked in.  $40 includes golf cart and after playing free burger and fries.  Let me tell you that burger and fries were awesome!  The service is excellent.  Golf manager, please extend this promotion rest of the year.  We just booked the tee time again and I think you need to extend this off during weekends too. I want to shout out to those waitresses for providing excellent service and thank you.  We will be there again next week."}
{"text":"I played Painted Dessert many years ago and it was ok than and I guess it's ok now.    The fairways are ok and the greens are pretty fast. The golf course layout was ok. Overall, course is wide open. You can pretty much put a blindfold on me I'll swing my club and I'll likely hit the fairway!  Haha  I only lost one ball. I hit an approach shot and it spun off the green and into the water.  All I have to say is it's nice to be playing golf in the sun and warm in late November!   My chief complaint was the courses slow play!  We go stuck behind a 4some of pretentious 'member'!  They all have their own golf cart but boy they ever slow!  Boys if you play that slowly I suggest you take up lawn bowling!  And why is there no course marshal driving around?  We paid our $60 don't we (Joe Public) have any rights?"}
{"text":"We played here 10/24/16 at about noon.  What a great value!  It was forecast to be a rainy day but we only encountered rain on the first hole and then had the course literally to ourselves.  The staff here were very nice and personable.  The course was in decent shape with a few holes still struggling from the summer.  The greens were simply outstanding... fast, true, and consistent, even with the extra moisture from the rain.  We love the design.  It's a bit noisy from the traffic but it isn't enough to be distracting.  Houses on the course aren't really in play unless you are really bad.  A word of advice: be careful on the cart paths if they are wet.  They were very slick and I even fell one time.  I think they get mossy from the sprinklers and don't suit soft spikes very well.  Good design, great greens, nice conditions, and excellent staff members make this course a true value in my opinion.  We will be back on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Just recently moved to Las Vegas.  Painted Desert is now my home course.  While its shorter than many golf courses, tight fairways, difficult bunkers and lightning fast greens make it challenging nonetheless.  Painted Desert is a classic \"target golf\" type course.  Course management is at a premium.  If you just like to rare back and whale away for distance, you'll find yourself in trouble more often than not.  Many times a considerably shorter drive will place you in a better position to make the green in regulation.  Oh, those greens.  Fast, fast, FAST.  On top of that they undulate in unexpected ways.  On some holes (notably the 7th) an unforgiving pin placement and a \"too long\" putt will find your ball in the water hazard.  (P.S. Try not to hit the \"coot herd\" on the 7th in the winter)  Overall, playing Painted Desert is an enjoyable outing from check in to the 19th hole, the staff is friendly, accommodating, professional and dedicated to giving you MUCH more bang for your golfing buck."}
{"text":"Nice price for a pretty nice, shorter, course.  Great twilight rate.  The major problem with all but one time I played here, probably 8-10 now, is there's no pace of play maintained.  Groups waaaaay to slow, way beyond what's acceptable for anyone who remotely knows golf etiquette.  Marshals would be great, too bad really cuz I won't return, don't have 5-6 hrs to play as a single."}
{"text":"Took some friends here and love this course. They had a great time and will no doubt come back again. For the greens fee here...it's a great value and at the top of my list. Joe Q is the man as he made my experience excellent. He pays attention to detail and shows he cares about people. With his above average people skills, I expect he will be managing this course by the next time I come back. Thanks Joe Q!"}
{"text":"Run down golf course.   If you enjoy playing 18 holes in 5 1/2 - 6 hours on the weekend then this place is for you.  Go to Paiute.   3 primo golf courses and and will cost the same or less"}
