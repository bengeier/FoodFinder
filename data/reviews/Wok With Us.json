{"text":"Yuck! I ate here and ordered the 2 item special with  Orange chicken and ginger beef with Shanghai noodles. The Ginger beef was hard and tasted like chewing on the end of an asparagus spear. I couldn't tell what it was supposed to be and I love ginger beef. The noodles were okay albeit a bit slimy and the Orange chicken had a slight fishy taste. I threw most of this purchase in the garbage."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to their single item Orange Chicken with their special \"HomeMade\" Hot sauce. It's a great filling meal thats not exactly healthy but with lots of protein. It's a great lunch or supper. It only costs 7-8$ with a tip.  Its a small family run business and the staff are very friendly when you get them talking. The hot sauce really is good. One of the best I've tasted in the city! I wish they had a calorie break down of the food.  4 Stars for yummy factor and friendly service. They loose a Star for charging $ to mix meats when it's same amount."}
{"text":"Mushy.   I took the orange chicken, noodles and mixed vegetables to go so I was unable to return this to them.  Everything was mush like it was sitting there since lunch, 6 hours earlier.  It tastes very much like those frozen Chinese dinners you can buy but never really taste right. I'm giving it 2 stars only because it was still edible in a \"at least there is something in my stomach\" sort if way."}
