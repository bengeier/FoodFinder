{"text":"I was in town for a ladies convention and was treated very badly.  I was not allowed to stay in my room not even 24 hours. Things didn't work on my room and the wifi was not good.  But the bedding was clean."}
{"text":"It was nice-but nothing on property for kids.  No pool!  My balcony off the room overlooked the US 60 - not to impressive.  Heard police activity multiple times through-out the night - due to close proximity to Fiesta Mall.  I was really shocked that this is a Hilton.  Also, the bar for the hotel is located in the middle of the lobby, which was a noisy combination."}
{"text":"Received great customer service upon checking in. Arrived in my room (2nd level), happy to see how spacious, clean, and comfortable it was. Lots of room to move around. Went downstairs to the bar in the Atrium, which was very nice. Had a drink while watching football, and enjoyed a great convo with another traveler and the bartender. I wish I could remember the bartenders name, he was very quick, prompt and friendly. Afterwards, I headed out for a couple hours. Upon returning I couldn't wait to get to bed. Let me tell you, their beds are extremely comfortable! I had a hard time peeling myself out of bed the next morning. When I did, I walked downstairs again (Atrium) for breakfast. What a great selection they had (eggs, bacon, sausage, French toast, oatmeal, many cereals, pastries, and several types of juices). Once again, the staff was very friendly and polite. This concluded my stay as I walked upstairs to gather my things afterwards to check out. Overall, I was very impressed wishing I had a longer stay. I honestly don't have one negative thing to say about this hotel and will definitely return again. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Average property at an average price. I was pleased enough with the room and service.  The staff was quite friendly and accommodating.  The building is old but has kept up with the times."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place???  The hotel itself is dated as has been stated by other reviews but there is much more to be desired as well.  The pool is exceedingly small for a hotel this size.  I've seen larger backyard pools.  The staff is nice enough; nothing special but nothing terrible either.  The restaurant is 2-star at best.  This is tricky though as most hotel restaurants do not pass muster in my opinion unless they are at the finest hotels and resorts so this restaurant is on par with most others.  Here is the real kicker though; in the front, just outside the entrance there is some prime loading/unloading space that is permanently sectioned off.  When more than a couple vehicles were there to check in, this made things very congested and more difficult to manage.  It seemed that this might be for the hotel shuttle but after asking I was told that IT'S THE PARKING SPACE FOR THE HOTEL G.M.  I didn't believe it at first, but sure enough later in my stay I see his silver Porsche parked right there.  Seriously, what kind of douchebag G.M. parks his car right at the entrance where his guests are supposed to park for check in and unloading?"}
{"text":"Just got home from Mesa. And wanted to give this hotel another opportunity. Still no Internet. Staff do not even bother to fake concern. What is this?10 months with poor    Internet service.  The service at the executive lounge was better. New staff had better attitude than the grump you had in there before.  Better but still not worth the price"}
{"text":"Before our stay I called the hotel to ask about the breakfast for our team reservation. The operator and the sales person I spoke with were nice and professional. I'm looking forward to our stay tomorrow and the next night.
The hotel is a little dated but for the price it's a good value! The location to the freeway is very convenient. The mall across the street is in major decline. Better malls are in Scottsdale or the Superstition Springs mall is ok for any quick shopping. 
Back to the hotel. The eggs and other hot food on the buffet were like warm. The breakfast was super crowded. The hotel was nearly at capacity. But the staff was nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Whether it's a night stay, a special occasion meal for my family, or I'm bringing in a 400 person event, the quality of the food and the attentiveness from the staff is always top notch.  The customer service is the very best.  They always make me feel special!"}
{"text":"Every time I go eat at the Hilton... my server has to be Monica ;) she's the best server I have ever had. Super friendly and great service! Thank you Monica :)"}
{"text":"The Mesa Hilton is a terrific choice for breakfast brunch. The petite buffet  offerings, professional staff and modern ambiance receive the gold star. Unfortunately the -4 stars is due to a self-serve buffet of cold scrambled eggs, cold sausages, cold bacon and cold pancakes or crepes with unheated plates. (Cold eggs and meats are often dangerous).

Truly sad, as we wanted to make this a Sunday tradition with guests. 
Correct this simple issue and you have loyal, long-term local patrons."}
{"text":"We love this spot for stayovers in Mesa. It's clean, comfortable and the pool area is comfortable and well kept too. We make sure to ask for rooms away from the elevators, but love that the elevators are quick here.  Definitely a great place to stay."}
{"text":"I'm a Diamond member and recently wrote an outstanding review for the Hampton Truckee location. Recently stayed at Hilton P/Mesa and have to say, not as old as the embassy's in this area but the management is not on par.

#1 room outside elevator...who gets that? 

#2 Iron, small thing until it screws up the shirt your wearing

Had Blanca the head of housekeeper come give me new iron and look at shirt
and the black gunk the iron spit out and said she would share with management.
I left phone number for manager a nothing. Logged a case with Hilton and he called
back and left vm which I followed up with three time and two business days later, still no word.

When I finally got a hold of him he mentioned he needed shirt for proof because his housekeeper Blanca didn't notice anything...really..look at the pictures.

Greg, you need some customer service courses. I hope you never get your own hotel!"}
{"text":"Lovely event venue for the annual celebration of the Mesa Man and Woman of the Year! Our meal this evening was outstanding! Would be so much better if the wait staff and managers were aware of exactly what was being served for dinner! Another concern would be the bar charging uneven amounts for items at the no host bar... Adding twenty-five and fifty cents to a drink..! Really??  Just round up to the even dollar, please!!! So annoying to be dealing with change and it really slows up the bar keepers!"}
{"text":"I checked in here tonight for 10 days. The hotel and room seem nice enough. My room and taxes are all on a direct bill with my company. When I checked in, I was asked for a deposit for room charges, pretty standard. It was $300! I don't have any need to charge ANYTHING to my room, much less $300. I asked if I could leave a smaller deposit. The clerk responded, as an exception, she could take $50 and turn off my room charges. GREAT! Nope. Took the whole amount. It wouldn't be a big deal, but in 6 months pregnant financing maternity leave. A hold of that caliber is unnecessary and there should be an alternative available."}
{"text":"Pool was closed on an 110Â° day. First they said reopen at 11am, then at 11:45 the front desk calls, said now 2pm. We leave to do some stuff. Come backnat 3, said now 4pm. Asked us to go another hotel to swim at their pool. Forget it, should have stayed there then! Hotel itself pretty nice. Rooms average. Toilet does not flush good, water pressure not good."}
{"text":"Stayed at this hotel for a relaxing getaway. There are a lot of positives: mostly individuals for business are stating so you avoid the loud, busy vacation scene, it is in a quiet location surrounded by shopping and restaurants, there is a bar with happy hour, wifi, free parking, and their employees are wonderful! One day housekeeping skipped our room, but the manager Garrett was apologetic even wrote us a letter and gave us 2 free drink vouchers! 

Things to work on: freshen up the maintenance of the room and more importantly the pool is NOT heated and rather small. You must go early bad reserve a spot! 

Happy travels."}
{"text":"The staff in this place have excellent customer skills especially Gloria on the concierge floor  and Jaime in the breakfast buffet   These two people made our stay a pleasure.  They were so accommodating.  
The internet should be included as most hotels are now.  This was the only downside of our two day stay
The suite we had was clean, spacious and we loved the slider actually opens for fresh air."}
{"text":"As a Hilton Honors Diamond member I'm shocked that on my daughters wedding night the shower drain was plugged and the shower was dirty. And without not being enough the next morning her and her newly married husband went down to have breakfast and we're treated rudely by the staff. I've stayed at hotels all over the US and have never had any bad experiences. I chose your hotel for a specific reason so that my daughter can have the best experience on her special night. I've made several attempts to get a hold of management with no success. Good luck if you stay at this place."}
{"text":"Had an amazing stay at this hotel! The room was clean and spacious and the towels were the softest I have experienced at any hotel (yes the towels were noteworthy!) The breakfast buffet was above and beyond what most Hilton's offer and Patty was a very friendly and knowledgeable server. The concierge lounge exceeded our expectations with quality offerings and great service. Our dogs were welcome too! They loved the little milk bones at the desk  and enjoyed the space to run across the street. My husband took full advantage of the M&M's. Overall a great experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice hotel.  Walked in and thought things looked neat and clean.  Room is your average hotel room.  We had a 2 queen room on the 7th floor with a view of the golf course.  Had no issue with the cleanliness of the room.  Bedding and bathroom linens seemed fresh.  

Executive lounge was decent.  I've been to a few Hilton's with an executive lounge and this ranked as what I'd consider average.  The breakfast choices were ok but I was surprised to not see any type of meats, i.e. bacon, sausage.  Not a deal breaker but would've been nice.  The food in the evening was good and the complimentary drinks were a nice touch.  The gal in the morning was very sweet both days.

My one complaint and reason for deducting a star was the shower water temp.  We all took showers at different times of the day and each time the water temp changed drastically throughout the duration.  It'd start out warm at a perfect temp, then would go to very cold.  We'd turn it up a little and then it'd change to nearly scalding.  There was no consistency whatsoever in the water temp so that kind of blows.  

All in all the stay was fine and I would stay here again if need be.  Just be careful when taking a shower!"}
{"text":"My room ac will not go above 72 room feels like 85. There is no full length mirror I this entire 2 room suite. The bathroom toiletries were either empty or half used ( disgusting). I called the desk las night and they said they could bring up a fan, I am sweating while I write this review. I have heard the freeway all night long. I am a Hilton diamond member and I will never stay or recommend this hotel. If I could give this 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"This review is for restaurant in the Hilton. We just hosted my moms birthday party as a private event, where we closed down the restaurant. The manager and staff were extremely helpful. For starters the service and coordination were on point. The manager went over and beyond to make the night perfect  for my mom. The food (Salmon, Chicken, Filet) was perfectly cooked, expertly timed, and very flavorful. Even when my relatives stayed waaaay past closing time, the manager did not rush us out. I will recommend their catering/staff for any future private events."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for 10 nights on business recently and the Hilton Mesa was a great choice for our trip.  Centrally located, really comfortable bed, good amenities, great service, and overall a very good stay.  Pool is beautiful,  breakfast at Zuni every morning helped us start the busy days right, and be sure to order the pizza at the atrium bar. Yum!  I highly recommend the hotel and would stay here again in a minute."}
{"text":"So I just got here and let me tell you! You would think this a great hotel but where the fuck is the service ? No bell came out to help us. No one fuckin greets you \"hello good morning how are you welcome\" did not get anything! Got some white chick working in the front doesn't even fucking acknowledge you or your family! This is our first time in Arizona so much for customer service here I see! I was struggling with the cart and no one even bothered to help us, had a security staring at us didn't even offer to even help! What kind of service are you running here especially at 5 am! So much for a great welcome for your first time guests!"}
{"text":"Meh. Noisy. I could hear the guy snoring in the room next to me through the walls. They changed my room, which was great service, but the next room was overlooking the pool and I could hear pool music and the highway until pretty late in the night. Seems pretty outdated as well. Pricing is actually reasonable but I probably won't go back just because of the noise."}
{"text":"Was here for a corporate meeting, it was definitely meh. I would not expect to see cracks and water damage to drywall in a Hilton, especially starting at $160 a night. Cannot comment on the rooms, but the common areas were not all that nice. The bar and atrium was chill, and that is where I spent most of my time, hence the 4/5 rating. Had this area not been as nice as it was it would have been a 2."}
{"text":"Stayed here in January (yeah I'm behind! I'm behind!) and was not too pleased.  It is conveniently located next to highway which made it great for getting to all of the other places we had to go as well as we could walk to some restaurants, the rooms were nice enough size, the staff was very nice and if you are a Hilton's Honor member that special lounge with breakfast and happy hour is great.  I wish I could remember the name of the woman who made the kick butt tequila sunrises because she was fantastic!  

So why the meh? The condition of the rooms!!!! OMG they were tired and seriously in need of updating.  Robe hook in bathroom was broken, the water faucet in the bar area of the sitting room had so much corrosion on it I was afraid to use the water, the sofa bed in the same area had about as much cushion as a flat pillow, and there were so many visible wires for the lamps and television just hanging around it was ugly.

I would've asked about another room asap but when we checked in we were told they were booked solid.  I'd return only if they could give me an updated room otherwise it would be another hotel."}
{"text":"Yes, the Hilton. No I'm not Bougie, I just got a sweet deal through Trivago for $70 a night. Say what?! 

Not sure what everyone is complaining about; my King room was clean, massive and the view of the sprawling dessert wasteland was perfect. We checked in around 9pm and everything was smooth and speedy, we even had time to stop at the hotel bar for a quick night cap and something to eat before they closed at 10:30pm. The bar food was actually pretty tasty, we opted for spicy chicken fingers and the Cobb salad which was a bartender suggestion. Nothing amazing, but after 5-hours of driving who doesn't like boneless buffalo tenders. 

This Hilton location is right off the freeway and is close to most everything in the Mesa Area; food, drinks, shopping and nearby neighborhoods. There's is a mall right across the street, but I hear it will be closing down soon. The pool looked nice, but the trip was so fast we had no time explore it or relax in the jacuzzi. 

Solid place to stay for a quick to AZ."}
{"text":"Standard Hilton as far as I can tell. Check in was pleasant and easy. Our room was very clean and well cleaned during our 5 day stay. We had access to the executive lounge during our stay and that was awesome. Nice view of the golf course. And the breakfast at the buffet was great. Remember that when you're at the buffet if you want an omelet or waffles and pancakes just ask your server and they'll bring them out to you. The servers were all really great. In fact, all the employees we encountered from check in to check out were great. And the complimentary human (m&m's) and doggie treats were a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Lobby looks great but that's it. Service sucked and they try to pry every dollar they can from you.  Paying $150 you would think they could give you or a contanental breakfast.  Nope, not Hilton. Add another $12 for wifi and $15 for breakfast. 
Lame corporate no class Hilton."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but pleasant experiences at this location. The staff has always been professional and curious, and the hotel itself is perfect for a quick weekend or a long stay. 

The breakfast buffet rarely fails me, with a good selection and great service. 

The bar is a great place for a quiet drink, or to meet friends and colleagues. The food is great, if a bit pricey (it is still a hotel after all, the food is never cheap)  I've enjoyed everything from their lobster BLT to their filet mignon. One of my favorite things is that they have a happy hour where they offer snacks such as chicken wings, mini empanadas, taquitos and other tasty finger foods. 

The pool area is nice, and if it is your sort of thing, one can spend all day there. They even serve food and drink in the patio area."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by my stay after reading some of the reviews. What really drags this place down is the location - a bit off the main drag that has a few good restaurants just down the road, but the surrounding area (the 90% vacant Fiesta Mall, most glaringly) left a lot to be desired. But the hotel itself was fantastic. They let me check in quite a bit early since they had an available room, which really helped me get ahead on my week. Rooms were spacious and clean, bathroom was very clean, and parking was ample but a little awkward (either park far away from the door or right next to a golf course with lots of \"park at your own risk\" signage.) The executive lounge was a nice perk as well, I only got to go in once but they had plenty of snacks and drinks available and it was a nice, laid back atmosphere. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to stay again, especially if the surrounding area picks up steam a bit."}
{"text":"We stayed here during Spring Training this year.  The price is a little high but the hotel is super nice.  We didn't have a chance to spend time at the pool but it looks very nice.  Our room was super huge and we had a view of the golf course.  The rooms were super quiet and we never heard anyone next door to us.  I loved how all the rooms overlooked the atrium.

Everyone who worked at the hotel was super friendly.  The front desk clerk was helpful giving us suggestions on where to eat and calling us a cab.  We went for a drink in the bar and both the bartender and manager were talking to us.  Everyone made you feel like you were a guest in their home."}
{"text":"Just came from a two day stay at this hotel, and I must say, an extreme disappointment. I've stayed at many Hilton hotels all over the world, all of which have been very enjoyable, but this one is undeserving of the Hilton brand. 

The hotel is extremely dated in it's decor, and although attempts seem to have been made over the years to modernize it visually, it ends up looking like a hodgepodge of styles from the 70's & 80's. 

The staff was always extremely friendly, especially at breakfast in the mornings, but to facilitate anything with the people at the front desk took forever as there was only one person who was ever working there. 

The rooms are large, although extremely dated, and the beds somewhat comfortable, although the air conditioning unit was extremely loud & blew cold air directly on the bed area when you were attempting to sleep. The bathroom had a built in vanity that looked like it was 30 years old, the stain worn off most of the cabinet, and the sink drain constantly gurgled. You always had to flush the toilet twice to remove all waste. The hair dryer wouldn't work the second day. And despite asking repeatedly for additional \"regular\" coffee replacements in the room, they would always deliver decaffeinated .... that in itself was maddening. 

The last night I needed some bottled water (the water from the faucet in the room is terrible) so visited the gift shop where they charged me $8 for two standard bottles of arrowhead water. I just looked at the cashier incredulously and said, \"You've got to be kidding me.\" He didn't even bother to respond. 

Do yourself a favor ... stay somewhere else, unless of course you are used to a Motel 6."}
{"text":"This is a really nice hotel. The nicest things is that both of our dogs, that are 50 lbs. each, are able to stay with us. Plus it only cost us a one time charge of $50. The Internet is the only downside here. You have to log in daily, even if you are a Hilton Honors Gold or Diamond member. The staff are wonderful and very very helpful. I will stay here again the next time I am in Mesa."}
{"text":"The room was clean and the bed was comfy. I even liked the pillows. The staff were very friendly. The breakfast at Zulu's was mediocre at best. The service was great, but It closes early, so make sure to get there early. I really liked the VIP lounge on the 7th floor. The guest attendant/bartender named Gloria was super nice and friendly. She even remembered my name and was so welcoming!! I'll definitely return to this hotel next time I'm in Mesa!"}
{"text":"This review is only for their meeting rooms and banquet facilities.  I've never stayed in the hotel.

I've attended several lunch meetings and presentations here in their ballroom area.  Their banquet staff is top notch.  All of the lunches I've had here were very good.  To test the creativity of a banquet kitchen, I often ask for the Vegetarian option to see if it's as good as their typical Chicken or Filet option.  During one meeting, I did that and they came back with a Grilled Vegetable plate that was amazing.  It sounds simple, but it blew me away....kudos to the chef and team.

The ballroom area is great for business meetings and functions.  The large bar in the lobby area on the way to the ballroom is great for after meeting cocktails and networking.  Tucked away in Mesa, I was surprised to find such a quality hotel.

Return Factor - 85%"}
{"text":"Bugs and a room down-grade! Terrible experience!!

We just came home last week from a weekend get away to Mesa. The original room we were booked in had a serious bug problem. The walls, the sink, the shower, the floor, etc. The room felt incredibly moist. So much so that the towels and sheets felt damp. I chalked it up to monsoon season and called the front desk to see if the problem could be remedied. They said they would be able to move us to another room once we got home from our activities that were planned. We got back to the hotel and the moved us without issue, but they moved us to a significantly smaller and lower quality (paint, fixtures, electronics, etc.) room. I called to ask about it and they moved us again TO THE EXACT SAME TYPE OF ROOM! The girls I dealt with were pleasant enough but between the bugs, down grade, and lack of communication we won't be back. My frustration and their lack of compassion was icing on the cake."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, the bed was REALLY comfortable, but our room smelled like smoke. Nothing really around within walking distance except the creepy deserted ghost mall. We stayed here for Spring Training and hit up Old Chicago, which was awesome (right across the freeway). It was easy driving distance to the parks, which was good. I hate that the breakfast isn't free, despite the small fortune you're paying for the room."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. When we arrived, they didn't have the suite we reserved and didn't have a regular room big enough for our family. They made it right by giving us two connecting rooms. 
The building is nice and in a convenient location for Mesa. The surrounding area is getting a bit room down, but it is easy to jump on the freeway to quickly get wherever you need to go. 
Only downside is no breakfast is included. When I stay at other Hilton locations, they normally give breakfast to diamond members."}
{"text":"This Hilton is just OK, definitely not the strongest Hilton I've stayed at.  2.5 stars.

Pros:
+ Friendly staff.
+ Rooms have a lot of space.
+ Inexpensive.  Not often can you find a 4-star hotel (although this hotel is probably 3 star at best) for $100 a night in any state.
+ Parking is free.

Cons:
- The style of the place looks like it was built in the 70s or 80s out of an endless supply of taupe stucco.
- The rooms, while large, also have dated style and inconsistent furnishings.  Also, the room has not been maintained well.  Paint chips, rust, even chips missing from the bathtub enamel.  The bathroom door creaks extremely loud, as if the hinges have not been oiled in years.
- The tap water tastes terrible and actually has a \"someone hit a skunk on the freeway\" smell.  They do sell bottled water of course, but it's $4 a pop.
- They still insist on charging $11 per day for Wifi.  In the days when Wifi is free at 1-3 star hotels, this is a disappointment.

Overall, this hotel feels extremely dated and Hilton needs to really bring in the renovation crew here to bring it up to date."}
{"text":"I made my reservations 2 weeks prior. I'm traveling from out of state. Im exhaused from my flight I'm and want to rest before our corporate meetings.  I attempt to check and get my room key. The receptionist said my room is not ready yet.  I notice that there are several families ahead of me (they are all colleague's) they are checking in and getting room keys. I was instructed to check back in an hour. I go back and attempt to check in and get my room key and again there are several people who are friends and people from my company checking in and getting room keys and when I asked why? I was told it's first come first serve. I explained I made reservations 2 weeks ago. Even my son has checked in.I still was not permitted to check in. I've been to this hotel in the past and experience the same service. I'm just so dissapointed and not happy at all"}
{"text":"Pretty good hotel in Mesa.  I was in town for the Phoenix Marathon and this hotel was conveniently located near the finish line/expo/bus pick up. 

Check-in was easy and they had giant candy dispenser on the desk for guests consumption. Yes! 

Rooms were very clean & spacious. Updated granite and fixtures in the bathrooms. Other finishings were a little outdated - popcorn ceiling, old (thin) moldings and baseboards, etc. But everything was clean and well maintained.  

We visited the pool and while it wasn't heated (visiting in February), we were able to use the hot tub and small kiddie pool that was warm because it was shallow. 

Also visited the executive lounge for breakfast and they had good offerings - oatmeal, eggs, bagels, breakfast pastries, coffee, juice. 

Although I won't be running the Marathon again, if I needed a place to stay in Mesa, I'd definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"The rooms somewhat show the age of the building, but the junior suites are great-sized and comfortable. 

Stayed for 5 nights in conference. The service from front desk, to the bar, to banquet staff was great. Friendly and accommodating. 

WiFi in meeting areas and room was spotty and bad. This effected one of the presentations I attended."}
{"text":"From the moment we arrived at this hotel, it was perfect. The staff when you enter was helpful, Gabe was helpful over the phone- they are phenomenal. The hotel was recently renovated and is extremely modern and clean. We stayed one night at another property in Chandler that did not hold a candle to this one. 

This is conveniently located in walking distance to the mall, Red Lobster and \"Dutch Brothers\" coffee. They also have a shuttle. 

Our room overlooked the mountains and my sister's overlooked the golf course. The restaurant staff and Starbucks counter were so friendly and accommodating. Anything that was needed during our stay was met with a smile. 

The feel of this hotel and its staff has set the bar high for the area. If you have any questions about where to stay in the area- this is IT. You will not be disappointed.  The management at this hotel should be commended. A+!!!"}
{"text":"Hotel is comfortable and clean.   The staff is great.  We have stayed here twice now.   Both times we stayed here there appeared to be boys travel baseball teams staying here which made it quite noisy and when we went to the hot tub we were quickly joined by 11 (no exaggeration a full team plus 2 extra lol)  little league boys  don't get me wrong here the boys were well behaved but having energetic fun in the hot tub when I preferred to relax a bit.   So my suggestion is to ask if they are aware of any little league bookings at the time of your stay and request a room on a higher floor so you don't hear the kiddos running around in the room above you."}
{"text":"This place isn't nice enough to be a Hilton. Very outdated.  I asked for a nice room as a Diamond member and they gave me a room with a view of the HVAC (complete with the noise) and view of the highway. I wasted 7 nights worth of points on this place. Pathetic concierge lounge. This is really depressing!

They moved us to a higher floor in the front of the hotel. It's quieter. The TVs are tiny and Conan was orange last night. Would be fine if this was a Hampton or if Hilton hadn't devalued its points and raised their rates. At least Marriott gives lifetime Platinum to its longtime loyal customers. 

I wonder what European travelers think when they come and receive this level of hospitality compared to the high level over there."}
{"text":"Hands down the best customer service I've ever had at a hotel. I will forever be loyal to the hilton hotels no matter where I'm traveling. I even had to call corporate to rave about the amazing stay. Beautiful rooms as well. They are so accommodating with all requests!"}
{"text":"Easy check in, lots of parking, clean appearance....

Our toilet ran all night and at one point started squealing. But since we got in at 1 am we decided to stick it out. The garbage cans don't have garbage bags, so weird and gross. I don't know why I am fixating on this but germs get stuck on plastic, no amount of scrubbing is going to get off all that DNA."}
{"text":"Excellent Customer Service definitely no complaints about that what so ever! When we arrived, they were friendly helpful and provided some yummy water to sip on while they set everything up. 

I booked a room with a king bed and much to my surprise I received a not what I booked, but a room with 2 queen beds (which is 100% fine) considering with that room came a patio complete with chairs to sit outside and enjoy the sun! 

My bathroom was perfect, lights a little bright and my only complaint was the shower water did not get hot enough, but it was manageable. I think the Peter Roth Thomas lotions and soaps made up for the not hot water! 

I would stay here again if I ever visit again!"}
{"text":"This being a true Hilton, I was surprised at the quality of the property and rooms. Very dated as others have mentioned. Upon check in I noticed the 5th floor smells of cigarette smoke, as well the room did. Opening the doors to air it out would be great if you didn't get the fryer smell drifting in from the kitchen vents below. Also, tough to sleep with the air conditioners running outside that particular side of the hotel. Checked out after one night and explained why and they just said \"ok,\" no attempt to make it right--at all. Bartender late tues 2/16 was great though!"}
{"text":"This is a nice Hilton hotel. Rooms are clean and very well put together. The TVs on the executive floor are big and have the expected channels. Food is decent and the staff do their very best. Just what you'd expect from Hilton. For some reason on my first stay their internet was not working correctly. Even though I had access to the premier internet access, it was very slow. I had a presentation the next day and it had real problems downloading the deck. So if internet is the thing you need, this might not be the hotel for you. Otherwise, it's aces!"}
{"text":"Stayed here for a week on business. Conveniently located, happy & helpful staff, nice workout room, & the restaurant on site had good food (I was surprised to find a huge organic salad on the menu). The major downfall of this hotel is it's age & need for renovation. My room had a damp smell, old dingy furniture (I would need to put a blanket on the couch before I sat on it), & gross calcium buildup on the shower head. I'm a Hilton diamond member & am overall comfortable in Hilton's but this one needs some TLC. The internet was a bit slow but this is the norm for hotels in general. It wasn't bad enough for me to leave & if I was having trouble finding other hotels I would stay here again but it won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Went to this Hilton thinking I would get a nice room and a good night sleep.  Was I wrong.  I got to my room to only be met with a dog barking in the next room.  I endured a few minutes of the barking until I could not sleep.  I called the front desk at 12:00am.  Yes 12.   Still barking dog.  WTF???!!!!!   The front desk said they would have security see what they could do.  The barking continued.   I fell asleep to only be woke many times during the night.  Well at 5 am the dog woke me barking.  What a joke.   The hotel and staff did nothing to take care of the issue and I paid over $150 to not sleep all night.   This is unacceptable and unprofessional to say the least.   This Hilton and it's management should be ashamed of themselves for allowing such an issue to continue with guests trying to have a good nights sleep.   The front desk did nothing to resolve the issue but just tell me they were sorry.   What about me paying to have an enjoyable evening of rest?????   I guess the dog was more important to the hotel.   What a joke.   Nothing but we are sorry.   How can you run a hotel and let barking dogs in.  I guess I was the one that should have left.   Not the people with a barking dog.   How irresponsible of. Hotel especially a Hilton.  I am repulsed at the management and Hilton for not taking immediate action to correct the situation or compensate me for not having an acceptable room I paid for."}
{"text":"For a hotel in Mesa, the Hilton Phoenix East has actually been an enjoyable home away from home for me. Since my house flooded two months ago, I've been living here at the Hilton and have enjoyed my stay and the amenities they provide. The pool is nice, the food isn't bad, and the numerous events and groups they have hosted since I've been here have offered an interesting mix of people to mingle with.

They also accept pets which is one the main reasons I decided to stay here, and are conveniently located right off the 60 at Alma School Road across from the Fiesta Mall. I've upgraded rooms twice now, my first facing the hotel parking lot, my second facing the pool, and my current balcony suite facing out from the front of the hotel. The concierge desk and complimentary shuttle has come in handy, and I've used their laundry service on multiple occasions as well.

One really enjoyable perk has been access to the Executive Lounge on the seventh floor, which provides access to a free continental breakfast in the mornings, and free appetizers and drinks in the evenings. Although this access is included with any suite room stay, it can also be purchased separately if staying in a standard room. The hotel restaurant and bar are also nice, adding to an overall satisfactory experience."}
{"text":"have stayed here several times due to work having a negotiated rate. quality of room \"renovations\" basically lipstick on a pig...but my last stay, I only had half a deadbolt installed on my door! that plus a general feel of general dinginess had me checking out for good. front desk tried to remedy but I had security concerns since all rooms offered were adjoining, made worse by stonewalling on an exec upgrade despite diamond status and showing ample inventory. 2 stars for Gloria in the exec lounge. she's the only reason I gave it another shot!"}
{"text":"This place suffers from bad location and bad design.  The staff was very friendly.  The room and grounds were very clean, and the bed was comfortable.  The most important aspects were great, but the overall feel of this hotel was stark and uninviting.  There just isn't any warmth here.  They really need to hire a professional decorator to give it a complete makeover.  The rooms, the lobby and especially the pool need color, fabrics, more greenery, etc.  I'm no designer, and I'm not gay, but I know what I like and this ain't it."}
{"text":"Dirty! There is dirt underneath the dirt.  Run down , carpet is stained in the hallways and ripping apart.  The carpet in our room turned our feet black.  Maid service is not thorough. A/C Units are barely working and noisy.  I was sneezing out dirt from my nose. 

Hotel allows pets.  A dog woke us early on Sunday Morning squealing and barking for 30 minutes straight. If you have allergies be warned not to stay here. 

The ONLY thing that made staying at this hotel bearable was the great customer service.  The staff was great and responsive."}
{"text":"Horrible preparedness for the whole company not be able to check in till 4 for the ball at 5?!?!  It's not like you didn't know the whole battalion is renting out the hotel to have THE event of the year. What do you mean all the early check ins are all done and we're ass out with kids in tow till 4pm?!?!  We've traveled day and a half and it's 8am now. Talk about TERRIBLE SERVICE. 
Wipe that fake smile off your face and call your supervisor...no, wake the BIG boss since all you can do is to \"tell the cleaning crew to move a little faster, the rooms aren't available till 4pm\". 
Can't get over that the major hotel chain would not know how to handle a large group having a MAJOR event and BE PREPARED for it. 
HOW THE HELL ARE WE GOING TO ENTERTAIN KIDS WITHOUT A ROOM AAAAAALLLLLL DAY LONG AND GET READY FOR A BALL AT 5 WHEN THE ROOMS AREN'T READY TILL AFTER 4?!?!
S.O.   P.I.S.S.E.D.
I'm gonna set up camp in the lobby, have kids nap in the lobby couch and plug in my curling iron and do my make up sitting on your beautiful carpeted lobby floor. WATCH ME."}
{"text":"This is a secret gem in the Mesa area. My wife and I have stayed here several times off season to visit family, and have had a lovely stay each time. The rates are excellent for the service you get. The lounge / atrium is an excellent place to unwind after a day with family or out at the zoo or the musical instrument museum. Food is good, rooms spacious and clean. Highly recommended."}
