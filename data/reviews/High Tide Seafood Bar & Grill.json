{"text":"This was an excellent restaurant with a great ambience and lovely food. I was in town looking for a great place to eat which would serve fresh food with high quality in reasonable portions, and I stumbled upon this place. The service was great, the food was excellent quality and taste and minimal disruptions. I ordered the kale and arugula salad which I did not realize had bacon on it. The server did not even question my concern and right away replaced the salad for my convenience and satisfaction. I was so impressed at how she did not even question it and said no problem we will just change the for you to make sure you are happy with your food choice. I would really recommend this place"}
{"text":"First time checking out this place tonight and it was very cool! Tonight we did an appetizer medley because we went early with our young son and just felt the need to explore the menu a bit. First of all we ordered our son's \"fish sticks\" to come first... Wow!! They were huge! He actually didn't eat them because he is not used to such fresh and delicious fish for his meal (18 months old) but we loved them! 
We also had the calamari, crab cake, lobster mac and cheese and a Caesar salad (for just 2 of us?! What were we thinking!) I would say the crab cake was the best! Lobster mac n cheese was really good but didn't live up to the hype I've seen on other reviews. Calamari and Caesar salad were good too. 
The service was amazing. We had a very attentive waitress and several other people delivering food, checking on us and clearing plates away! I love that kind of attention- they really want to make sure you are enjoying yourself. We ended with the creme Brûlée and it was delicious!! We ordered way too much food and have our left overs for tomorrow!! We will be going back for sure to try the pots! And maybe even the fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Food was awful, very bland and poorly prepared. Ambience and service was ok. But this place is 1star at best."}
{"text":"What can I say could not ask for more. Zack our server was on point. All of the staff there was the upmost professionalism and courtesy and they knew what they were selling. I went in short notice with a family of 6 first time there it was impeccable. You get what you pay for and was one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in my many years living in the valley. Thank you guys very much."}
{"text":"Great family date night!  Great HH, kids menu and dinner menu!  Also love they have a gluten free menu!"}
{"text":"I would say 3.5 but I can't and while the atmosphere is quite welcoming, the food is very ordinary. That's not to say the food isn't good, it is. For example, the seafood is fresh, they display the origin and a description of their oysters on a blackboard which is nice. They also have the steam pans that they cook most of their dishes in, which cooks the seafood to a great consistency, undeniably a good thing but when it comes to flavor profiles the dishes I had seemed uninspired as there was nothing risky or impressive about them. I had \"The King\" ($19) and \"Tide Roast\" ($14) steam pots and the Cajun Shrimp Boil ($15). The king was a spicy  tomato cream sauce with crab meat, scallops, salmon and calamari with fettuccine noodles. The tide roast was basically the same thing with a simpler sauce and instead of noodles you get a scoop of dirty rice, the rice was actually more bland and dry than dirty; it had a nice color but contributed no complimentary flavor to the meal. The Cajun shrimp boil was about 7-10 Shrimp in a multi-broth (fish/chicken/beef, I'd imagine) with added oils, herbs and spices and some corn to top it off. The broth was good probably my favorite of the three, and shrimp were a decent size but collectively everything was so similar it was like eating the same meal with small variations that had no significant impact. Maybe I have a hard time justifying the cost or I should have tried something else but based on my first visit I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"This has a beautiful classy style as soon as you walk in. Great professional staff. The menu has something for everyone. Clam chowder & the lobster bisque soups are the best in the Valley. Sea Bass is tasty as is their burger and the fried chicken. If you love Fresh sea food cooked perfectly and creative dishes? This is the place. A little peace of heaven here in Arizona."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh fish! It is very difficult to find an excellent restaurant in Gilbert, when comparing to Chicago where I just moved from. This place has a great, diverse menu with a fun cocktail list.
The ambience and location are the only downside considering the price that you pay for the food.
I will go back soon! Great for date nights also! 
The steam pots are awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Seafood in the desert! YESSSS! I love good seafood and it's so hard to find in AZ. I was pleasantly surprised to find this right in my backyard. Much larger inside then I expected. They had plenty of seating and a very large wrap around bar where the cooks are steaming delicious pots of yumminess!

Had the High Tide combo of chilled misc seafood. The shrimp were amazing! Very large and cooked perfectly. The oysters were also very fresh and delicious. Came with various condiments. The least impressive was the king crab. It was very watery which is usually a sign of being frozen. It was still good though. We ate it all!  

Also ordered the Steamed mussels. It was average. When I have mussels it's all about the bread to soak up the broth. They brought what they said is sourdough - it was very airy but did not have a lot of flavor. A toasted baguette would add greatly to this dish 

All in all it was a great meal and we will definitely be back again to try one of the pots!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious, fresh, and great selection. Great venue, nice staff. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I kept going back and forth from giving them 3 stars to 4 stars - here are the reasons.

We started with a caesar salad, the romaine was fresh and crisp, however the dressing tasted like it came from a bottle.  My son had the yellow fin tuna and he said it was great. They also served tempura asparagus with his meal and that was also very good.

I had the fried shrimp which was good however the fries tasted like they were frozen fries and not fresh cut. I didn't care for the peach cole slaw but that could be just a matter of preference.  The portions were large.

For dessert we had the beignets. Skip these if you have had them at Cafe du Monde in New Orleans. They were under cooked and tasteless here."}
{"text":"I have yet to find something I do not like.  I am a huge fan of the Cajun Shrimp bowl!  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and great seafood in the valley.   Long waits on Fri/Sat nights.   
Chapino is great!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to try this place for dinner. They had three different varietals of fresh oysters shipped in from the east coast.  We ordered fresh shucked oysters and seafood cioppino, paired with their pilsner on tap. Everything was fresh, service was prompt and attentive, ambience was nice. We will definitely be back to try more of their offerings next time!"}
{"text":"Stellar. Simple menu, good service and good food. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. Very clean and modern look inside. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service, the wait staff was clearly more interested in themselves than service. We saw our entrees sit in their heat window for almost 10 minutes.  The oysters Rockefeller were delicious but the service was so bad that we will not be back."}
{"text":"Best customer service from the hostess, waiters and bartenders. They all were wonderful, accommodating and attentive! Only critique was the oyster shot was served warm."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, we went with our son, daughter, and spouses and were really disappointed. I had the \"special\" of sea bass and it was so dry I almost choked. 
 When the food came it came in segments. 2 entrees,,,,1 entree....2 entrees. You'll note 5 entrees eventually came yet we had six people. My daughter never got her entree because we eventually found out from the indifferent server that the kitchen had \"lost\" the order. Lost? So she never ate and I couldn't eat the sea bass, two others were not impressed with their entrees. Overall, a ruined evening. Poor systems in place, mediocre food at best. You can't live off Happy Hour, you have to serve good food. The owner wasn't much help neither. Never get us back there."}
{"text":"One of a kind place here in the valley.  The gumbo is awesome; large portions and great to share."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE NEW PLACE!! No more driving around town searching for good seafood, it's now just a couple miles down the road. AMAZING seafood, great atmosphere, I can't wait to go back to try the cocktails. I've been telling everyone I know on this side of town to check it out - it's a hidden gem that won't remain hidden for long!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner and absolutely loved everything! I need to eat gluten free, and they have a menu to accomadate. Thank you again for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"Hard call on 4 or 5 stars. Prices aren't horrible but aren't great. Food was really good, not great. Ambiance was great! Service was amazing, almost too good, someone checked on us every 2 minutes.  Literally. To me though it gets 5 stars as most restaurants don't work this hard to be great. It's obvious they do! Important to note, I am a moderate seafood fan. Bread pudding a must!"}
{"text":"If you like seafood you must go here! Some of the best calamari I've ever had and in Gilbert! We had great service and great food. They have Happy hour specials too!"}
{"text":"Red Snapper special was great! The King was alright, I wouldn't order again. But we will be back again. Several menu items look very interesting."}
{"text":"Biggest waste of $90. Both entrees came out served with cold sides. The asparagus was dried out and shriveled up. We brought our concerns to the manager and he just walked away. Didnt do anything accept walk away.  Horrible experience..dont waste your money!"}
{"text":"Great menu and one of the best happy hour drink and menu offers on the area.  Everyone is very friendly.   We love the creole shrimp boil!"}
{"text":"Bad service,  Rotten food. 

Poor service- waited at least 10 mins to get saved a drink while waiting at the bar !
Slow food - waited another 20 mins for a dozen raw oysters
Bad food - got half- way thru the oysters and had the worst raw oyster experience in my life.   Then oyster I started to chew on literally tasted like feces... Spit out quickly and rinsed out my mouth with alcoholic drink.   The response we got was \"we hear you didn't like the oysters\" !!   Very poor responsiveness to customer. 

Been here a few times before and was reasonably pleased.... Won't go back after this experience.   They've really lost it."}
{"text":"The lobster bisque was out of this world. For an east coast native, this is the best seafood restaurant I've found in Arizona. The bar manager John makes a mean Old Fashioned too. My wife had the Tide Roast which was an 8 out of 10, I had the gumbo which was 9 out of 10. Go, eat and enjoy."}
{"text":"Best fresh oysters east of the 101.. Plenty of selection and served with all the right toppings.. The lobster Mac and cheese is close to Oceans Club quality, less the price tag. The King is good but the sauce is a bit bland. The cioppino is stellar. Friendly staff. We sit at the bar by the steam pots to watch the dish being made."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal and service!  A lengthier menu would have gotten one more star...we want more!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried High Tide last night for the first time. I just found my new favorite restaurant in my new home state of Arizona. The owner greeted us. She went through the gluten free options for us since my husband has Celiac. They have an extensive Gluten free list of foods to enjoy. He had the Salmon with the citrus sauce for his main course. He loved it. Keep in mind he grew up on Cape Cod in Mass with a lot of seafood.I had clam chowder and the Tide Roast Steam Pot. Both were delicious. Also, I'm a hard to please NYC girl, so you know this had to be wonderful for me to give 5 stars. Our waitress was great. The General Manager introduced himself to us. Everyone was friendly. 5 stars from start to finish from hospitality to our meals!!"}
{"text":"We went there as the owner was the chef at our country club. He is a wonderful chef and this place did not disappoint. Food was outstanding and service was excellent."}
{"text":"I found the term \"steam pot\" to be misleading. It is served in a small bowl, not a pot, and it is mostly pasta with a decent amount of fish and a very small amount of the more expensive seafood. My steam pot had salmon, and I did not care for it. However, I did find the small amount of seafood that was in the steam pot to be of quality. The staff was very friendly. I might try eating here again, but would likely go for happy hour or lunch instead of dinner."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but their service is about the slowest I have ever had. It was the worst!!!! Anytime we wanted something we had to flag someone down in passing. Forgot one thing we ordered and brought it late still charged us for it but no offer up on how they can make it up to us. It was 50% wine night and they still didn't charge us correctly. We didn't even look at the bill we just wanted to get out of there and we tired of sitting  around. After the fact we notice they didn't charge my wine correctly when I had spoke to am employee about it before I ordered. Will we back? The food was amazing and the chefs infront of you were very helpful. He explained the hot sauce and was very informative but the rest of the service was awful. We might give them another try or go on a night where time isn't an issue."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Setting is very nice. Service is off scattered, off, disjointed."}
{"text":"Great seafood restaurant for all! They have lower cost options for those on a budget but a great selection overall. We had the Lobster Bisque snd Crab Cakes with fried avocado. Outstanding! Service was quick & our server was attentive. We also decided on Creme Brûlée for dessert. It did not disappoint for the $6 price tag!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here yesterday and were very disappointed. We both love seafood and are always looking for somewhere new. This will not be at the top of the list. We started with the clam chowder. The soup had broken with the butter floating at the top. It was obvious the kitchen tried to save it by adding roux which only made it worse. The manager offered to replace it with lobster bisque. Again it tasted of roux which is not an ingredient that should be used in what should be a smooth creamy and buttery soup. At this point our server completely disappeared. My iced tea was not refilled, another server brought our second course of mussels and it would have been great if someone checked back. There was no bread included, we only had dinner forks to remove the mussels, I was thirsty and the mussels were definitely not fresh. We set the bowl at the edge of the table and waited as several employees walked by and ignored us. Finally we asked the hostess to get the manager who took the mussels back to the kitchen. Upon his return he informed us that these were Mediterranean mussels and they tend to be stronger flavored and that the kitchen staff was now enjoying them. I worked in the restaurant industry for 20 years. Much of it in high end seafood houses. I know what all types of fresh mussels should taste like. When they are sour and are incredibly strong smelling it is time to throw them away. I tried two and I paid for it several hours later in the bathroom. I wonder how the kitchen staff 
fared."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some fresh seafood and a friend not only recommended this place but raved about it. We went on  Friday night and besides there being a 1:15 minute wait, we loved it and think it was worth the wait. We ordered the two tiered seafood combo and a lobster bisque. The food was fantastic and the service was excellent. Definitely recommend this place and will be back."}
{"text":"I've lived in Gilbert for 16 years, and I believe High Tide is my favorite local restaurant.  It is difficult to find good seafood in the desert, but High Tide is successful.  Wide variety of food, nice atmosphere.  Almost went to 4 stars due to the prices, but I think the value is worth it."}
{"text":"I was sadly disappointed.  Great service when I walked in. We were seated within minutes. Unfortunately, after that it went south. Server did not know the food being serves. She had to refer to her notes and her descriptions of the oysters were 100% wrong.
 I ordered a dozen 1/2 shelled oysters and they were the saddest little metallic tasting things I've ever come across.  We also ordered  The King which is a creamy pasta with  bits of fish and sea nuggets and one crab leg.  It was only OK. We also ordered the mussels but were disappointed in how SALTY it was. No one in the kitchen or their staff must be tasting the food. I guess I'm thinking there's a trained cook in the back when in reality there isn't?  The manager was kind and offered us bread pudding on the house but we still walked away wishing we were served better tasting dinner."}
{"text":"slow service and you'd better order the soup, because everything else arrives so oversauced and overdressed it might as well be soup."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place for lunch. I had the fish sandwich, which was the size of two fish sandwiches anywhere else. Absolutely amazing, perfectly cooked, just enough batter, great tartar sauce, and it was accompanied by their cole slaw with a unique peach & pecan flare. Sat at bar, service was great, bartender was both helpful and knowledgeable about their menu items. Clean, well lit restaurant."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place. Had the Calamari for an appetizer and was not impressed. It reminded me of fish sticks but calamari. Had a lot better! I had the high tide burger and it was a hamburger with king crab meat on top of the Pattie. The meat was cheap and very greasy. The bottom bun was soaked with the grease and the meat wasn't warm. I couldn't even eat half of the burger. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food!! Happy hour is very affordable and has superusers that are easy to fill up on.. Service is excellent!! The friendly wait staff work as a team to make you feel well taken care of"}
{"text":"ok, so I am relatively new to seafood,  and don't enjoy that fishy taste.  I had an appointment nearby, and saw the sign on the building and decided to take a look.  What a wonderful surprise.  The decor is modern, open and clean. The staff is attentive and friendly.  The menu is relatively simple,  but what they prepare is done to perfection.  The Glass Pear martini was yummy.  The selection of steam pot seafood made my decision difficult to make,  but I was very happy with the presentation,  and the first mouthful was delightful.  The seafood not over cooked, the broth,  spiced to please the taste buds. Will definitely be going back and recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"First time here - service outstanding. Our server was extremely knowledgeable of the food, the preparation, and the taste of what was on the menu.  Great selection of daily fresh fish and seafood.  I had a dish called \"the king\" and it was fantastic.  We have been waiting for a place like this in Gilbert away from the downtown area - privately owned makes it a definite go to for us as we are business owners as well and love to support local business whenever we can.  Great happy hour specials and a wonderful casual atmosphere - can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"We went to High tides for first time and celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary. The service was great we had an appetizer calamari was fantastic and we had the \"king\" which was incredible. The blueberry mojito was very good with puerto rican rum Don Q. Bread pudding was to die for.We will be coming back soon"}
{"text":"My neighbor recommended this restaurant to me. High Tide has now become one of my favorite and most frequented places to eat. I totally enjoy happy hour and the entrees are fabulous especially the steamed pot dinners. Dessert is always a plus when I have room. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the staff is simply fabulous. If you haven't tried this place you should at it to your list and don't forget to get the fish taco's. They are oh SO good!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! The food is fantastic, portions are much larger than expected and prices are reasonable.  The best part is the incredible service. Good customer service is hard to find and this place hit it spot on. Ask for Aaron as your server!"}
{"text":"Everything was great! Our server was nice, the music was good, games on the screen, environment was pleasant, but let's talk food... Starters: calamari, lobster Mac & cheese and Cajun style shrimp boil (all good choices). I had the lobster bisque which was amazing! Others ordered fish & chips, one of the steam pots & a fish special. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Very tasty :)"}
{"text":"This was an excellent find for my wife and I on yelp.   It is not the type of restaurant that you would expect to find in a strip mall let alone in Arizona.  The fish/seafood is all very fresh(same day and no farm fish)and full of flavor.   The service was outstanding and we were seated quickly after making a short stop at the bar.   The atmosphere is fun yet a classy feel to it.   This is by far one of my new favorite restaurants in Arizona."}
{"text":"I thought their food was really good. I had their appetizer lobster Mac and cheese. By far, not an appetizer, it was an entree. Completely with the money! So rich, you can't finish it in one sitting. When you take it home, it is still very good. Happy hour is great was well!"}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect when I heard I was being to a new seafood place in Gilbert... Luckily my expectations were far exceeded. The staff was great &our server very attentive. This was by far the best seafood restaurant I've experienced in AZ and I am big on seafood. We ordered 3 of the Steampot Specialties; The King, The Tide Roast, and the Cioppino. All of which were amazing, fresh and delicious. They were all from $19-$27 range I believe. You pay for quality and here it is beyond worth it. Best Cioppino i've  ever had, from the first bite to last it was fantastic. We will definitely he returning to try more dishes soon!"}
{"text":"Looking for a great seafood restaurant? This is it! We (party of 6) went here purely by chance, and it was great. Came in for dinner on a Saturday evening (we made reservations), and didn't know what to expect. We were happy and full when we left. We started with 2 heaping bowls of mussels that were so good we took the broth home and made it with pasta the next day. We all had an assortment of seafood dishes that also gave us happy faces. The bottom line was that it was so good, we're going back this week."}
{"text":"ive had great seafood, and this place doesnt measure up. The shrimp is comparable to frozen bag bought from Walmart...rubbery and pungent. Im from the Gulf...its not that hard to cook shrimp right.

the muscles and clams were also cooked poorly. there are specific ways to prepare seafood...this place just isnt trained right.

my wife said it left her stomach feeling aggravated, but didnt want to tell me, but she felt she had to after I mentioned I got a migraine for the first time in years after eating the lobster mac n cheese left overs as part of my dinner the next day. 

Im sure the place is great, we just didnt have that type of positive experience. the waiter was super helpful and kind tho, so great CS!"}
{"text":"What a great place for seafood. Crab cakes are amazing and on Saturday and Sunday they have a Bloody Mary Bar. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken ever and the seafood gumbo is delish!"}
{"text":"Finally I don't have to drive to Scottsdale for seafood. This place is wonderful. Food was delicious, service was great and location location location. Had oysters on half shell and fish and chips. Both were amazing. So excited a genuine seafood place is now close to home."}
{"text":"What a find!  Delicious food, outstanding service, nice ambiance, and great Happy Hour.  Best seafood I've had in the valley in a very long time.  Everyone at our table totally enjoyed it. Totally worth a visit and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Well that was fantastic. Sept 2015 Restaurant Week offer was on point. Excellent 3 course meals we would come back for again and again. Attentive, helpful top-notch service from Chantel."}
{"text":"Steam Pots!

The boys had the Cioppino, she had the tide and I had the king. Each one was bursting with flavor and fish and all the good stuff. It was absolutely delicious and the boys loved it. The atmosphere is casual but nice, I want more. Next time, no kids haha.

We had a great meal and a fun time. Highly recommended! 

Thanks"}
{"text":"We have tried this restaurant twice now and, unfortunately, had very poor service both visits.  (Our server seemed to have his line down pat - \"Sorry for the wait.\"  We heard this as we waited to be greeted, to get water, to get refills, to order, to receive our food, to get our check....). I would expect this on a busy night, but not early on a Thursday.  Plus we weren't overly impressed with the food -- to rich and buttery for us.  On the plus side, the crab cake is excellent!

The young man who greeted and seated us was exceptionally friendly.  He was the high point of the experience!"}
{"text":"Not impressed! 33.00 for one dozen tiny tiny oysters on the half shell. Just not worth my time or money again!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I always gotta squeeze in a dozen or so oysters no matter how busy things get during the week.  The lobster bisque is also a must have.  I'll be back again soon!!!"}
{"text":"This is a gem of eatery. Fresh southern style seafood with live music and great drinks. Went there on a Friday night and wasn't too crowded. The service was quick and responsive. Great acoustic live act playing that helped set the scene. Would definitely go back for sure."}
{"text":"This is the best seafood place around for the money. We made happy hour and sat at the bar for 1/2 price appetizers and 1/2 price well drinks. These were the best and strongest happy hour drinks I've ever had and $4. We sat at a booth, I had the seafood steampot and my husband had the cioppino. Both were delicious meals. I used to get a steampot over at a restaurant in Scottsdale that has now disappeared. You must taste this food, delicious!!!"}
{"text":"It seems a rarity nowadays to visit a restaurant with stellar service accompanying superb food. From the time we walked in we were constantly being told \"thank you for coming in\" and asked how the food was. We sat at the bar near the steam pots in which the chefs make their signature dishes and were actively engaged by them regarding all aspects of the seafood from where it comes from to how it's handled. Another towering strength of this establishment is their variety of tap and canned/bottled beer. We will be back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"What a fantastic flavorful meal we had here!  Prices are exceptional for the quality and quantity you recieve. The staff is professional and gracious. Our waitress Summer did a great job explaining the menu and making suggestions based on our questions. It was a prefect meal!"}
{"text":"The gumbo was great! I went to school in Louisiana so I know good gumbo."}
{"text":"The seafood tower is fantastic. Service was a bit slow but the food made up for it in the end. Great place"}
{"text":"We took a table of 8 to High Tide for lunch on Mother's Day and it was wonderful.  The space is open and fresh without diners being shoved together to fit more bodies in.  You can choose to sit at the end of the bar with a TV or the middle of the bar where you can watch them making the steam pots or in roomy booths or at tables for large groups. We had Mimosas since it was Mother's Day, but the Bloody Mary bar looked really interesting with all sorts of add-ins.  Service was quick, friendly and knowledgable - not high school kids earning gas money.  Three of us chose the Special from the Blackboard - the Crab Crusted Halibut with Lemon Risotto and smoked, grilled asparagus with Citrus Beurre Blanc.  One had the Cioppino, one had the Gumbo, one had the Salmon and one went with the Crab topped Burger that was as big as her head!  Each was done right and presented well.  The Cioppino and Gumbo were filled with lots of seafood and just enough juice.  We didn't need the salt and pepper shakers because everything was seasoned properly. I haven't had a good risotto like that since we were in Italy.  Chef Eric came out to greet us and make sure we were happy.  And we were!  After we scraped our plates clean we thought we were full, but the tray of fresh Beignets with a dish of chocolate sauce had us reaching for our plates and forks.  

Several reviewers commented on the limited menu but I thought it was great that this new kitchen decided to go with fewer items and do each one right.  There was an option for seafood lovers, fried chicken addicts and burger fans.  The 4 year old at our table dug into her mac and cheese and just kept spooning it in.  How often do see 4 year olds do that?  But the adults in the group were doing the same thing.  Usually I offer to share so the other diners can have a taste, but this time I wanted it all to myself.  And I will go back to try something else on the menu, knowing it will be just as good."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time at High Tide. The service was excellent. Jennifer was our server and was very helpful in helping us decide on our orders. The saw bass was outstanding! My husband enjoyed a Cajun Steam Pot. He almost licked the bowl clean. Our daughter had huge Alaskan King Crab legs which were excellent. We shared the calamari appetizer which was delicious! We will go back."}
{"text":"Doesn't take a lot for me to have an amazing date with my man, but this place makes it even more amazing. I'm from Washington where seafood is prime. That being said, this place is beyond impressive with their quality and 100% to my seafood standards. Love that our waiter wasn't stingy with the bread either!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place, food was so so, hot pot was just so rich, way overdone,way to heavy, had such potential.  Crab was dry, probably frozen, but all in all not so bad considering it's in the middle of a desert."}
{"text":"Yelp's restaurant timings is incorrect. We went on a Saturday night at 10pm assuming it is open till 12 (as mentioned on yelp). The person there said they have only half of appetizers menu and nothing else!!

Please call them before going here."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by my friends, we live in the neighborhood, so we gave it a try.

The staff - excellent!  Extremely friendly staff, and the owners are wonderful!

The atmosphere - warm and welcoming!

The food - outstanding!  We had calamari (the best ever), fish tacos  (big and tasty), shrimp cocktail (my daughter loved it), and the burger for my son (his favorite).  The best of all - the \"Cajun Style Shrimp Boil\" - awesome!!!

I called earlier in the night to inquire about the reverse happy hour, and the server remembered my name.

Class place, class staff, and \"World Class Food\"!

A+!"}
{"text":"Ok....First time going here and it was pretty good. Got the Fish and chips and clam chowder. Both were excellent. I guess the reason for the 3 stars is that they have no Manhattan Style Clam chowder. This seems mandatory. Also.I thought the place was too brightly lit.
Picky I know, but seafood is near and dear to me.  All in all not bad."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful from staff food and owner stopping and talking with customers. Calamari best we have ever had. My husband doesn't normally like it but loved it!  He as had lobster bisque n had at least a piece of lobster in each bite. We each had a different steam pot and they were all very tasty. Only thing I would say is both myself n son both asked to add on oysters and my son had several in his and I only had one. Should of said something but it was all worth the money. The suggested wine was very good!"}
{"text":"I am a seafood monster so believe me when I say that the search for good seafood dishes that can give me a break in the kitchen is difficult.  I had the calamari which I try everywhere in order to catch a possible good one.  Over the years I have been impressed only a few times.  This one is quite good.  you can taste the flavor and meat of the squid very much.  The season is bold.  I had the Ciopino which was also very tasteful wanted more crawfish but still done right. Gumbo is pretty good. Lemonade needed to be made fresh but not a deal breaker. Very nice customer service and nice clean restaurant which is very important to me.  Yay"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for seafood. Aside from the outstanding food what impresses me most about this restaurant is the staff.  Everyone from the kitchen staff to the bartenders, food servers and hostesses, they all work together to make your dining experience a pleasure. Our family has all worked/works in the food service industry and realize how important the staff is to a good establishment. I commend the owners for seeking out employees who care about their jobs which makes the dining experience exceptional."}
{"text":"High Tide never disappoints, food is awesome. Lobster bisque, beet salad, fish and chips.  Debbie is fantastic. Always top notch."}
{"text":"Great assortment of sea food and the best buttermilk fried chicken.  Make sure you put in reservations especially if you are going on the weekend."}
{"text":"Surf and turf burger was excellent! Nice atmosphere. Great service, David  made many recommendations. Sous chef was also very personable while working the steam kettles.  Cool concept. Will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service and excellent drinks! Good portions that leave you delightfully full. Nice atmosphere with huge oversized booths. Best place around if you care about quality."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place 4 times now with my wife and some friends in hopes that the food quality would improve.  Not happening.  

Rubbery seafood and the crab my wife had last time was down right bad. 

Lack of salt, lack of flavor, lack of spice.  I don't mind paying good money for good seafood, but after four tries I'm throwing in the towel with this place."}
{"text":"Best seafood in the VALLEY!! We LOVE this place! Always excellent food and great service!! It was my husbands bday and they went above and beyond with my requests. Jennifer was our server/bartender and she was on top of everything and so friendly! Their Bloody Mary bar is amazing too! Highly HIGHLY recommend this place!"}
{"text":"First time here tonight. Server was so so. Could have been more attentive. Ordered Caesar salad. Very good. Then cioppino. First time I've had it. Thought pretty good flavor but really heavy on the shrimp. Was supposed to include calamari but did not find any. Also would have liked some good crusty bread to soak up the broth as I've heard is usually served with it. Requested some bread but was brought small soft rolls. Guess that's all they have. Not really impressed with the place and probably won't be back. Also had a Bloody Mary to start. Made with crushed ice. Really diluted the drink...not good. My dinner companions varied with their satisfaction. Does not seem any of us were too impressed."}
{"text":"My daughter had the spicey steam pot with a variety of seafood and pasta which was absolutely wonderful! Take note however that it does not contain any heavy spiciness at all.  But it is very velvety with the tomato cream sauce and has an excellent flavor! I had the fish and chips and ordered oysters on the side. It was battered and fried to perfection! We started with the calamari which I think may be amongst the very best that I have ever had. Our service was nothing short of stellar. This place is awesome and we will be back"}
{"text":"This place was super good! I ordered their fried okra, mac and cheese (which was homemade!), and an order of their crab bread (forgot the name). It was delicious and the people I ate with ordered crab which they really loved! The waitress was super nice and attentive. The decor was really amazing and unique! They put seashells in a glass bowl on your table which I had never seen before. The colors were very nicely done and it just looked overall really classy. Would highly recommend. Prices were not too bad either!"}
{"text":"This is the best seafood I've had since moving back to Arizona!  The food, service & atmosphere are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, over priced for what you end up with. We started with beer steamed clams, eh, they were ok. I had ahi tuna, I love spice but this was not expected and too much to enjoy. The side of asparagus was the best part. My husband had surf and turf burger, had a small amount of crab, if we didn't know we would have thought it was just a regular burger. We did enjoy sitting at the bar and watching them make the different steam pots. We may go back to try those."}
{"text":"Someone in that kitchen can cook! Biggest surprise at a seafood restaurant was finding braised short ribs that were incredibly tender and flavorful. Beef happened to be gluten free as was half price shrimp cocktail during happy hour, the side peach slaw, and a list of other items on the GF menu. Took a star off because wrong entrée was delivered but promptly corrected. There is a southern vibe and special cooking gear."}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you. Freshest seafood in the east valley. The oysters were amazing. We had the gumbo, salmon and tide roast. All were in great!  We are from LA and know our seafood!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a couple girlfriends and it was wonderful.
The only low point for me with the prices, the prices are high but the food is good.
We had the crab cake to start with and it was wonderful and moist and full of flavor. The lobster Mac and cheese was a HUGE portion and amazing! 
I ordered the Tide Roast and it was so good I didn't want it to be gone ever. The taste was perfect and everything was cooked well. I will for sure be getting this again!
We got a side of the PeachSlaw which I was sceptical about but was very very good
Overall I will be back to try more

The service was WONDERFUL, our waitress was so nice and fast. She answered all of our questions about the food and restaurant and was a joy to talk to."}
{"text":"I went to High Tide last night for the first time.  LOVED IT!!  The staff is so friendly and our server, Ryan, was awesome!  We had a large party (separate checks) and everyone was served in a smooth and timely manner.  The food was great and I can't wait to bring my husband there to have the fresh oysters.  The band playing that night (Chuck E Baby) made the whole atmosphere and experience so refreshing!  We will definitely be going back this weekend!  High recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We love High Tide.  Great food, people and the ambiance is tops.  I love the Lobster Mac and Cheese, fresh fish and the specials.  

Happy hour is so much fun -- actually anytime at High Tide is enjoyable

You can see that the owners - Chris and Kim really care about customers, the staff and promote a top shelf experience.

We love High Tide.  Thanks team!!!"}
{"text":"Was there last Sat.- heading back this Sat. Had lobster bisque and crab cake both very good. Wife had steamed clams which she claims best ever.Clams had 22 clams on Happy hour only $7:50. Great Happy hour value. Regular menu very reasonable for seafood, most dishes under $20. You will not be disappointed. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great food and great environment.  I have had great meals there every time. Highly recommend you try the oyster specials as they have then regularly."}
{"text":"We had dined here on two previous occasions but they were at lunchtime. We had fish and chips, which were excellent and that was why we returned a second time which was equally good. This last time we had an out of town guest who wanted to go to a nice restaurant even if it meant a 25 mile drive. We therefore made reservations for dinner. I could not resist the fish and chips again - big disappointment and mistake! The cod was tough and chewy and certainly not flaky and tasty as it was before. The batter was much thicker and kind of doughy in contrast to the crispy light batter I had previously.The fries were awful, probably were frozen and were overcooked. Luckily, the other two members of our party had a different dish which was very good. 
If it was just myself and my wife I would have sent it back, but because we had a guest I did not want to complain, particularly as we had recommended High Tide to them in the first place.  Needless to state, we will not be returning anytime soon as after that I don't fancy fish for a while."}
{"text":"Amazing. 2nd visit here and can't wait for my 3rd. Had 1 of the steam pots  - can't remember exact name of it - but had cod shrimp artichoke & shrimp with the red cream sauce and instead of pasta had rice. Was amazing. Friend had the gumbo and she said it was outstanding. Our server Summer let us try all the sauces before we made a decision on what to eat. Smart woman. Really helped. She also gave us a taste of the soups. Both were outstanding. Bring an empty stomach it will get filled up. Took home the double chocolate cheesecake and had a small taste super good   Highly recommend and try to get Summer as your server she is very knowledgeable about everything on the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and dined there for Saturday lunch. I ordered the Fish & Chips. He order the Halibut sandwich. The fish was good and the fries was awesome. We got very good service also. Definitely will go back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Loved this gem of a restaurant! You have to try the lobster mac and cheese, and the calamari; both were delicious! Also shared the \"King\" entree with the hubs and even sharing it, we couldn't finish. Delightfully prepared and packed with seafood: not an over cooked piece in the entire dish. Our waitress, Deb, was so much fun and has personality to spare! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had our rehearsal dinner here for 25 people and it was amazing! Food was on point! Price was just right and service was great too! Will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"The seafood was fresh and well prepared. Your server was friendly and kept us aware of the food timing. The water was not filtered and had a hard taste. They should also offer a better bread with all meals Overall a food experience and we will be back"}
{"text":"We had a great experience last night. Had heard good things about High Tide decided to try it. It was busy but we expected that. We were able to get seats right away at the bar and that turned out to be the best move. We were entertained by watching the oyster bar cooks prepare meals. They were friendly and answered questions about what they were cooking. That helped us decide on what to order. Food was outstanding service was great and we met other people at the bar which made for a wonderful time. If you go when they are busy just be prepared to wait a little. It is worth the wait. If you are in a hurry go to long john silver's"}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant with another couple this weekend to try it out after reading the reviews on yelp. For appetizers we had the black mussels and fries with sea salt. Black mussels were nice size, but broth needed a bit more garlic and salt. Our waitress Alex was so very accommodating and got us a small dish of garlic to add to our broth witch made a huge difference. The fries were very crispy and with the sea salt made them extra tasty. Hubby tried the New England clam chowder, that was ok, always hard to compare that as we visit Boston quite frequently and they have the best! I got the Cesar salad and have to say they might want to rethink the dressing as it was not very flavorful, but the lettuce was nice and crisp. 2 of us ordered the fish Cioppino that had a lot of fish and broth just needed a bit more garlic ,but the sourdough rolls were delicious. One ordered the Louisiana Gumbo with white rice that was very tasty and hubby ordered the Spicy seafood pasta that had a wonderful not too spicy cream sauce  although the pasta was a bit over cooked. But we have to say our visit with a few bumps was well worth it as our waitress Alex could not be more attentive, friendly, and knowledgable about the menu.  We will be back, and we hope we get Alex again!!!  Also want to note that the manager addressed us personally and And listened to our comments---- which we did not ask for him , he came to our table. I gave a 4 star because of the service and we know the next visit we can address our concerns if we order any of the same items.
We dined outside and it was a beautiful cool AZ. Night!!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Great to see a restaurant in the east valley that offers excellent good with a great environment.  The service was great at the bar, and the food was off the charts.  The Sea Bass was a must order.  Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to High Tide for happy hour.  After all, I am the happy hour hobo... Cheap drinks and eats?  Count me in!  BUT...it has to be good and High Tide fills the bill.  So, for us happy hour hobos, they offer 1/2 price appetizers.  Upscale without the upscale price.  We had the calamari, the wings, and the clams.  The calamari is very good.  It looks like fries.  The wings are delish. They are tossed in a combo house hot sauce which is to die for and honey. So good.  Get extra house hot sauce to dip them in.  The clams were so good too.  Will definitely be back to try more goodies..."}
{"text":"We went for Mother's Day the service was good with the exception of our entries did not make to the table at the same time if fact the arrived 5 mins apart
No the good stuff 
I had the tide roast with dirty rice it was superb and the serving size was large we also had the sea bass wonderful cooked well and the citrus cream sauce was great
The lobster bisque was some of the best we ever had
The Bloody Mary bar was fun 
Great place to take the family"}
{"text":"Love this place. It was the best seafood in the Phoenix area . I had the seafood soup. Was there for lunch but heard the happy hour was amazing. Atmosphere was very classy and the service was great."}
{"text":"I am so glad that we finally have a great seafood restaurant in Gilbert.  It is very hard to find fresh seafood in Arizona and now we dont have to drive all the way to Scottsdale to find it!!  The staff was very friendly and so were the owners.  They have their fish flown in and it is very fresh- not frozen and not fishy.  My friend had the oysters and thought they were very good.  Calamari was cooked perfectly and we loved the dipping sauce.  Clam Chowder was perfect- lots of clams, and creamy. Kids had the mac and cheese- it was house made, reasonably priced, and tasty.   My friend had the Gumbo and I had the Ciopino -- both were great.  This isnt red lobster at all-- Just the opposite.  Fresh, High Quality Seafood and great chef that knows how to prepare it."}
{"text":"Yep they are right. This is the place to go for good seafood out here. The lobster bisque is a little too salty for my blood pressure but everything else was perfect"}
{"text":"I highly recommend High Tide, 5 Star food and service, ambiance could use a better touch but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"We have been to High Tide twice.  From Service to food this place is wonderful.  It is such a treat to enjoy a non-chain restaurant in Gilbert.  We will be back often!!"}
{"text":"Went in today and had fish and chips the last three times going there was not the greatest but still holding hope out that it would be like the first time that we went the fish was not as generous as it used to be not even the same size the fish was dried out on the inside they took it back and cook to more but said I couldn't have it well done because they're afraid the fish would dry out again it was not dried out from cooking it longer it was dried out cuz the fish was dried out so the fish was undercooked and I couldn't eat it was so looking forward to a great meal left there eating only one piece of fish I think it's about time that we just don't go back again this would have been the fourth time that we were we were disappointed gave it all we had kept hoping to our dismay"}
{"text":"What a great place tucked away in my neighborhood. This place never disappoints. The food and drinks are top notch!  We order the seafood  soup cooked in the clearly visible steam pots. 
 The ingredients are fresh and serving size is large enough for hubby and to share.
 We have tried all the soups bowls on the menu they are all very good.
The entire staff is friendly and service is also top notch!
oh I almost forgot about the bread pudding, it is the best I've ever had and I've tried bead pudding at several restaurants in the Gilbert /Mesa area  looking for great bread pudding and we always go back here for the bread pudding."}
{"text":"HIGHLY recommended. Everything was perfect, including the service. We ordered lobster bisque, it was rich and creamy and divine. I ordered the cioppino which was also perfect, as were the sourdough rolls that came with it. Wife ordered fish and chips, which came with cole slaw. Usually cole slaw is treated as an afterthought, almost like the parsley that used to come on your plate that was purely decorative, drowned in mayo and obviously dished out of a large food service container. No, this cole slaw was fantastic and I could have eaten a bowl of it. I believe it had walnuts in it, the cabbage was fresh and crisp and just enough sauce to moisten it.


 Can't wait to go back here. Prices were fair and the seafood was fresh (flown in daily, I believe). The server knew our needs before we had to ask and knew to clear the plates when finished, a failing that really gets under my skin because it seems so few servers know to do this."}
{"text":"My family and I have been meaning to try this restaurant since it opened. My expectations were not very high because the location is tucked away in a strip mall next to Sprouts, and it's just not the place I would expect to experience a high-end seafood meal -- but I was pleasantly surprised! First drawback however was upon walking in, there is a very strong seafood smell, which was a little off-putting (but the longer you're in the restaurant, the less you notice the smell). 

We had a large party, 10+ people, so we were seated in the back party room. The servers were attentive to us and brought us everything we needed. Furthermore, the food was delicious. I ordered the salmon with garlic sauce and risotto, the combination was absolutely delicious. The salmon was cooked \"medium\" to perfection, not raw, and not overcooked to oblivion. My husband ordered the Roast Tide Steam Pot, and said it was very very tasty!  

This is definitely a place where you go for a treat; it's not an every week occurrence as the prices are on the steep side. My salmon dish was $24 alone. But when I am in the mood for a great seafood dish and don't mind the cost, I'll come back to High Tide."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about this place, I love it!! My husband and I celebrated our 21st anniversary and the service and quality of food was amazing!! I ordered scallops with orzo and grilled asparagus and they were cooked perfectly, amazing flavor!! Thank you soo much for making our anniversary so memorable"}
{"text":"Went in date night to happy hour Friday and they did not disappoint.  Great prices for great seafood.  We got the clams, mussels and Lobstah Mac n cheese and it was doing good.  Here are some pics."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing experience at this place. The food is phenomenal! Summer was an amazing bar tender! Highly recommend this restaurant any day! The best restaurant in Phoenix by far! Best date night!"}
{"text":"The family was craving seafood and thank you yelpers for leading us to this place. Got to satisfy my raw oysters cravings and enjoy a nice atmosphere with great service."}
{"text":"1st & last timer. Nice looking place... Restaurant had only a few tables with customers at most during lunch time, thinking it would be quick, wrong!! The service was terrible!!!! Very slow and had to flag down anyone to place order, get food, and then again to get the check plus forever to get it back! I don't even want to know what it would be like when it's busy. Pretty good food but bad service trumps any chance of having a decent menu, which may even be a bit overpriced for their own good. Not a restaurant pro but this place needs some help."}
{"text":"High Tide continues to be on our rotation of favorite restaurants.  The food continues to be great as does the service."}
{"text":"First review I've written, and it's because I love this place! Amazing seafood, lively atmosphere and the Happy Hour is one of the best around (1/2 PRICE APPS and reduced drinks from 4-7 daily). I've been here four times, and everything is incredible: baked lobster mac, calamari, lobster bisque, shrimp boil... even the burgers. Good beer selection on tap, and the service is amazing!

Perfect place to take the whole family or for a special date night. I highly recommend, and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Hubby had the king pot n LOVED IT!!! LOVED that the restaurant was very clean, staff was very friendly and Informative, place didn't have a nasty fish smell. VERY FRESH fish nothing frozen! I had grilled chicken and was so amazing as well! Will for sure go back! I don't eat fish but hubby does and we don't go to a lot of seafood places bc they smell so so bad BUT not this place! You almost wouldn't even know they serviced fish bc no nasty smells! Thank you high tide for an amazing night out!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed. I had the Tide Roast which was simply amazing.  Great portion size and the flavor was really, really great.  Wife had halibut and beet puree.  She loved it as well.  It is busy and a bit noisy on weekends so we sat at a hightop in the bar area. Just fine. If you do not want to wait, this works well. 

Going back for Louisiana Gumbo next!!"}
{"text":"We just had dinner at High Tide and OMG, that was the BEST seafood I have eaten ever. I had the halibut w/lobster tail and my fiancée had the chicken wings with a side of sweet potato fries. We both were amazed at the taste of our food, it was seriously the best ever!! Our server Chantel was amazing and very friendly, fun and knowledgeable about the menu items and gave great suggestions. We will definitely become regulars and I will suggest this restaurant to everyone I encounter. I can't wait to eat there again!!!"}
{"text":"Okay I think it's too expensive. I think the service is bad! I am not going back there again bye bye hi tide"}
{"text":"Wonderfully fresh seafood, great cocktails, and even some wonderful dishes for those meat and potato folk... aka my husband. Short ribs are phenomenally fantastic with layers of flavors and oysters never displease. I personally feel like I am getting a deal when I come here. :) yum!!"}
{"text":"The lobster bisque at High Tide is outstanding. I also had a salad with scallops that was really good. I have been twice and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We tried a few things here and it was all amazing!! It is hard to find good seafood in the desert but this is fresh off the boat :) Our server,  Dan,  was friendly and very helpful when it came to choosing the must haves!  I am glad this place is close to home. We will definately be back!"}
{"text":"We love High Tide! The gumbo is to die for. Freshly made in steam pots and don't forget to try to hot sauce! We crave the red beans and rice with sausage and will even order it to go for lunch the next day. We usually sit at the bar and Jen always take such good care of us. Who would think that we could find great seafood in the desert, but at High Tide, it's a sure thing!"}
{"text":"It sounds strange; but Gilbert, Arizona now has an excellent seafood restaurant.  This was a meal I would have expected in San Francisco, Portland, or Boston and then I would have come home and told everyone how good it was.  I can highly endorse the Roast Tide Steam Pot, Lobster Bisque, the King Steam Pot, and the oysters on the half shell.  I didn't try the Lobster and Mac, but it sure looked good.

Many thanks to our server, Elise, who was attentive, informative, and very pleasant--great service."}
{"text":"The number 1 rule in this business is to make sure every guest leaves happy. Make sure the guest is going to tell people good things about your restaurant. The owners and management of High Tide clearly do not care about this. After waiting over 40 minutes for our entrees, my fish was hot but everything else was lukewarm at best. After sending one $30 entree back, and much discussion by management (within plain sight of us) we were asked by the manager if we would like our food to go? We were then told that our food was not cold! As a long time manager in this business this person just broke rule number 1!! I of all people know that the guest is not always right! But you never tell them that they are wrong! Service was fantastic but management needs to realize that taking care of the guest comes before worrying about your food costs! Shame on you High Tide management!"}
{"text":"The Best food in town. Everything is excellent. Wait staff, service and the best desserts in town. The appetizers are fantastic and so large they could be the meal."}
{"text":"Being from New England, I was surprised to find seafood of equal quality here in the the desert. High Tide is my new go to when craving seafood.Fabulous food with fantastic service.Yum!"}
{"text":"Our family came from 4 states to celebrate my mother in-laws 95th bday.  We reserved the Sunset room on Dec 23rd and all 19 of us were blown away with the great service and absolutely superb food!  What a fantastic celebration in a fantastic place!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service.  Large portions.  I was specifically impressed at the lengths that our server went to in accommodating my wife's difficult order. She made sure she had it right."}
{"text":"I have waiting for a good seafood place in AZ and I've finally found it! This place is the real deal. The fish is FRESH and delicious. The ambiance is wonderful as well. They had a singer on Thursday night who was terrific. One last thing, the service is the best!!!! They are training people so well and it shows. Total professionals. Looking forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat is High Tide. The staff is friendly and great - thank you Ginny for always taking care of us - and so sorry to see SteamPot Chef Roger go. :-( 
Over the last 2 years, we've invited many of our friends along and they too have become fans - even our out of town friends and relatives what to go back when they return.  

BTW, sitting at the bar is way more fun and interesting because you can watch the chefs cooking in the steam pots.

Favorite dish - Salmon! Always excellent. Steamed Calamari - Excellent. Lobster Bisque - Excellent. Gumbo - Excellent. Even non-seafood like chicken wings (excellent) and braised ribs (excellent) are favorites.

The owners are great and do enjoy feedback and immediately take steps to rectify any issues we're ever had - fortunately we've only had a few."}
{"text":"Amazing Seafood in Gilbert.  Our server Betsy was super knowledgeable and helpful. We're hooked, no pun intended. Tenille."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious! Especially for seafood in the middle of the dessert! Lobster Mac and cheese is inspirational, surf and turf burger was glorious! Hear wonderful things about weekend bloody Mary bar and hope to check that out soon! Service is underwhelming but the food always makes it to the table...so 5 stars from a seafood lover from the northeast."}
{"text":"I love High Tide!!! Best seafood and service ever!! Ginny, the manager,  always smiling and super friendly."}
{"text":"Wow. That's all I'm going to say. Roger the chef was incredibly nice to my wife and I. He recommended a few things and he was 3 for 3. Food was the best seafood we've had since we lived in NY. Everyone must go and try if you love seafood. Crab cake, lobster bisque, lobster Mac n cheese. BOMBDOTCOM"}
{"text":"I went here for my 31st Birthday, recommended by my Mother-In-Law. If your near the Queen Creek/San Tan Valley area please check this new gem out.

Fresh Fresh Seafood is what they preach & let me say I have no complaints. From appetizers to share, individual steam pots & many more food options to make anyone excited to eat. Even if you do not like seafood, you can still eat here.

Also they are great to accommodate for any event!!"}
{"text":"Stupid good food!!! Words cant even do this place justice, they have exceptional staff as well.

We had:
Lobster mac n cheese
Lobster bisque
Crab Legs
Sausage and cheese app
Surf n turf burger
Salmon
Crab risotto 
Oyster bloody mary
Pickled Pink cocktail  

And it all was extraordinary!!! The staff was kind and attentive as well. Mark the manager also made sure to greet our table and make sure our needs were met. Beautiful atmosphere to boot"}
{"text":"To be fair, we didn't eat a meal here.  We just had drinks and apps. The mojoto was a bit sour and just had a trace of mint. Beau enjoyed his beer but we found the bartender on the phone while he served us offputting. We were delighted the calamari was strips of calamari steaks vs. rubbery rings. BUT they were rather dry....
Mentioned this place to a buddy who was also underwhelmed. Wish them luck on the new business. It is pretty but not 5 yelp stars by any stretch."}
{"text":"Twice we've been here and the service was incredibly slow. The first time was a date night and we ordered gumbo, tide roast, and fish and chip. It took over 42 minutes for the food to come out- at this point we were hungry we weren't sure if the food was good or if we were delusional. 

Since the quality of food was decent, I decided to give it another shot and brought my mom and brother to try the joint. This was a Wednesday evening around 6:45 pm, restaurant was pretty dead. We ordered the spicy pasta, the king, and burger. I was very curious if service would be as slow as the first time so I kept a watchful eye on our server. Our plates (this was an assumption at first) sat on the serving window for about 15 minutes. When she did go and retrieved the order- the food she brought out was cold. My mom is a pretty patience lady unlike myself and sent the king back because the dirty rice as extremely cold. 

I want so bad to like this place because the food itself is very flavorful. One day hopefully the service will catch up."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last Saturday night with my daughter.  I absolutely love this restaurant.   Server was attentive and friendly and there when we needed her. 
Had the Pacific Sea Bass and it was to die for!   Perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.   Presentation was artful and could hardly wait to taste it.   My daughter had Ahi tuna and she said it was best she had ever eaten.   
It is my very favorite Seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"Great menu, exceptional service and delicious food. This is a great spot, and they have a great selection of items. Wasn't crazy about the lobster bisque, but everything else was great. The salads are huge! Don't pass on the bread, or the seasonal dessert (pumpkin butter cake). Yum!! Can't wait to try happy hour."}
{"text":"I cannot stress enough how delicious the food is here! I came with a party of 5 and we shared the lobster Mac and cheese which was absolutely fantastic. For myself, I ordered a house margarita and the Tide Roast. However, I love spiciness so I asked for my meal to be simmered in a spicy tomato cream sauce which was out of this world. The seafood was perfectly cooked and I added some additional hot sauce to make it even spicier. In fact, I loved the hot sauce so much that I bought a bottle for $5 (it's made by the restaurant itself). The entire experience was great and I will come back here again!"}
{"text":"Have been to Hide Tide Restaurant in Gilbert, AZ numerous times. Love their fresh clams, oysters and salads. But yesterday I  had lunch there with a couple girlfriends and decided to try something different. I was \"very disappointed\" with their lobster mac n cheese. Lots and lots of pasta but very little lobster for the price. Had to hunt for tiny pieces in the macaroni. 
Well I had to try it. Service is always great but feel I had to give a thumbs down on the lobster mac n cheese."}
{"text":"I'm from California and frequently visit the east coast. So seafood in AZ doesn't exactly appeal. But trust me, it's amazing. We tried just about everything. My favorites were the oysters on the half shell, lobster bisque, crab legs, and salmon. Yes, we tried everything!"}
{"text":"Excellent seafood here.   Ross the chef was very friendly and informative.  Most of the dishes are prepared right in front of you (if you sit at the bar).    Great beers on tap.  The wait staff was very friendly and attentive.  The appearance of the restaurant was was tidy and clean.  I would absolutely eat here again,  and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Eaten here a few times and never disappointed .  Steamed mussels are our favorites.   It's tough to find good seafood in Arizona and this place delivers every time ."}
{"text":"Great place for a date. I decided to get the fish and chips (a trip to England has me eternally searching for the comparable match) and regretted that choice. The tartar sauce was the best part. My wife's food was much better. Stick with the seafood for sure."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant recently. The staff were prompt and helpful. Food was excellent. I'm sure I will be going back!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for oysters so my bf did some research on Yelp and saw this place. We are impressed! We luckily, dumb luck that is, came during happy hour. This was a great situation as many items are on special so we could try several dishes for a good price. 
We started off with the lobster bisque, this was my second time having it (first time was on the Fisherman's Wharf in SF). It was delicious with nice big chunks of lobster. Next we ordered a dozen oysters and they went so fast we barely realized how quickly we ate them. We figured someone must have stole some off our plate. They offered a variety of toppings for the oysters and all three were good. 
Next we moved on to the lobster Mac & Cheese. By itself it was a tad bland, but our waiter quickly told us about the house special hot sauce, this is a must!! We also had the beer steamed clams. The bread brought soaked up the broth perfectly. 
Finally, because I think my bf is trying to kill me via gluttony, we had the bread pudding. He said he would come back here for that alone. It was cinnamon goodness in a bowl. 
I have nothing but great things to say. 
The highlight was the service. Our waiter, Ryan, was quite attentive. He offered several good suggestions and had a great personality joking with us. We noticed that all the employees seemed happy to work here. It has a good, positive atmosphere, and the music was good too!!"}
{"text":"Seafood in Gilbert, AZ..Yeah Baby. Hit this place at a weird time..2 pm after shopping at the mall. This place seems very careful when selecting their fresh catch and they say they turn it over and only serve what is fresh I believe them.  Had the Calamari and was shocked to see the steaks that were presented. Yum. The sauces accompanied were unique. Lobster Bisque was very hearty and chewy and it worked. Plenty of craft beer selection. Summer waited on me and was sweet and attentive. Keep it going. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week with a friend, since I didn't know it existed and figured this was a good time to check it out. Yum! First selection of $33 included calamari, spicy seafood pasta, and bread pudding. Second selection included oysters Rockefeller, gumbo, and gelato. 
Clooney Summer to drink was a perfect accompaniment (berries and basil)! 
Great looking bar area, comfy booths, and the restaurant filled up quickly during the dinner hour. 
Portions were perfect, but we were beyond full by the end. A great way to sample new places and multiple dishes!"}
{"text":"5/18/14:  I hate to write anything bad about this new restaurant because the food was very good and I would love to see them succeed.  However, I can't give a great review because the dinner service we received was terrible! 

We were greeted immediately by the hostess and decided to go to the bar to have a pre-dinner cocktail and wait for the rest of our group.  The bartender (female) was attentive and friendly, acknowledged and welcomed us and took our drink orders within a few minutes of sitting down.

Once the rest of our party arrived we moved to a table - total of 8 - and it took over 10 min for our server (male) to even approach the table to ask if anyone wanted to order drinks.  Once the drinks were ordered we waited another 20 min before I finally walked over to the bartender and asked if she could deliver the drinks as they had been sitting on the bar for 10 min or so - and she did.  

We ordered appetizers and they were fantastic - best calamari I've had in a long time - but our plates remained on our table for over 30 min after we had finished.  We ended up piling them in the middle of the table to get them out of our way and the owner came over and started clearing them while our server walked past several times kidding around with another female server - clueless!  

While we were waiting on dinner and throughout the meal, we had to flag our server down on three seperate occasions for extra napkins, water and more drinks.  We ordered a nice bottle of wine and he opened it, poured all three glasses without even asking if we wanted to taste it first - and then slid the bottle to the middle of the table and walked away.  

I can't tell you the last time I didn't tip a server atleast 15% but that night he didn't even get 10% on a bill that was over $300.  I will go back because the food is good but they could learn a few things with regards to hiring quality servers - specifically one in particular."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best seafood around. 
Cool restaurant with the steampots in the bar. 
Great place ."}
{"text":"I live right by this restaurant and was excited to see a seafood place opening up. Finally made it tonight and was very pleased! As others have mentioned, the Calamari is wonderful! I wasn't very hungry so ordered the Lobster Bisque, which was very good. Not too salty like some can be, a good balance of salt and sweet lobster in a rich and creamy broth that you expect with a good bisque. My daughter got the kids mac-n-cheese which was gourmet style....and very good. I hate going to restaurants and paying $6 for Kraft...so this made me happy to see it was homemade. My mom got the fried chicken which she said was very good, and a very big portion (brought lots of it home). The other family we dined with got the King Bowl which they raved about and when I'm hungrier I'll definitely go back and order that, it looked fabulous! We also tried the mussels as an appetizer and they were very good...perfectly cooked and tasty! Our friends liked the oysters as well. We got a few desserts and they were delicious. They have a decent wine list too which made this wine lover happy. The best part is that i could walk or ride my bike here which is a wonderful plus!! A great addition to the Val Vista/Williams Field area....so happy they opened!!"}
{"text":"Short review: The food is good. Service is slow. Waiting for my check. I couldn't do lunch here on a work day."}
{"text":"Wow! What can I say about High Tide?? I love this place!! We have recommended High Tide to many friends and the initial response we always get is, \"isn't it pricey?\" Actually, no. While we would expect to pay a hefty premium for fresh seafood in the desert, High Tide provides ample portions of fresh seafood at reasonably prices. 

Whether happy hour or dinner, you won't be disappointed in the selections. And the service is superb! Jazzie (the bartender Jasmine) is one of our favorites to visit for a late night snack and/or drink. Management has always been great checking in on tables and always visible on the floor. But the food is the main attraction...

We've tried many dishes here so I won't bore you with a dish-by-dish breakdown. Suffice to say that from the appetizers to the lobster we've never had a bad meal. Healthy portions of fresh seafood prepared just right Its no wonder they have gotten quite a following. Ample adult beverage menu should satisfy any guest as well. Overall, out of selfishness, I almost don't want the world to know about this East Valley gem! You will truly enjoy your visit!"}
{"text":"Always skeptical about seafood places in a landlocked state, but coming from the Gulf of Mexico and growing up with fresh seafood it's always nice to try a new seafood place out.  I went with my wife and was actually shocked at how big this place was.  Definitely shouldn't have a problem getting a seat here .  I ordered oysters in a half shell for an app and they were very fresh, so I was pleasantly pleased.  I also had the gumbo...which was excellent and a must try in my book.  If you like seafood then this is the place to be to get it."}
{"text":"This is not how see food should taste at 4.5 star food restaurant! Huge disappointment!
Good service but very very bland food. Having lived in Seattle for five years I became a see food snob. I expected to try something unique based on 4.5 stars reviews. I was deeply disappointed. I would have given one star for the way their food tastes if it not had been for the service. Salmon and halibut entrées tasted no better than average American diner food at the price of $23 a dish. In fact I had to add black peppercorns and salt to my fish which I am positive wasn't a halibut as it was said in the menu!!! Side of mashed potatoes was relatively good but that was not the reason I came to this place...
I am not coming back. This place is just overrated and not for true see food lovers!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the atmosphere is really lovely and the portions were really generous"}
{"text":"Really like this place. The food was really good we had the fish and chips and the kale salad. I loved the decorating and ambiance is very minimal but perfect. The music wasn't blaring too loud and we ere able to have a nice conversation. Another huge thing is that the temperature in the restaurant was comfortable too. I didn't feel like I needed a winter coat to eat lunch."}
{"text":"This place is rather in disguise! We are from Texas, in town for a conference. In Dallas, we can get good seafood year round generally. However, when we go out of town, my 85 year old grandmother believes she should be able to  get good seafood no matter where we go. Despite reminding her that Az is probably not going to have the best seafood in the desert, she demanded seafood. Found High Tide on Yelp and decided to try to satisfy her request. When walking in, the place looks rather moderate, as it is in a strip mall next to a department store. The food and drinks were rather AMAZING! We tried a variety of items from crab cakes to the shrimp boils, even in the 90 degree weather (Yes! In February) and it was all great. Atmosphere was good, even on a Tuesday evening. My grandmother is a tough cookie and even she loved everything. We would definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best seafood restaurant in the area!  Sometimes the service is not always at 100% but I would not say it is awful.  I enjoy sitting at the bar and watching them cook the steam pots.  Plus they have one of the best Happy Hours, oysters are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I went to dinner at High Tide and it was an excellent experience! I was recommended this place by a friend and after checking previous Yelp reviews, I figured I had to give it a try. 

Decor was nice and simple, with a semi quite atmosphere and good service. I ended up ordering the Tide Roast and my guest got the Salmon BLT. Both dishes were excellent with nothing to complain about. All my seafood seemed fresh and was told the Salmon was really enjoyable. My only disappointment was that I wasn't able to try more from the menu on this one visit! 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys seafood and will be going back soon to sample other delicious foods from the menu!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite happy hour joints. Friendly staff and great food. I typically get the ahi tostadas with a side of their peach and cashew coleslaw and smash it all up with their spicy creamy tomato sauce, delicious!  My husband usually get their wings which are ginormous and meaty and he loves them. Yesterday he wanted to mix it up and got their burger, thumbs up and the fries were awesome. The drink prices are fair and they have the best ice in town. (We're ice freaks.)  Great bar atmosphere, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Holy butter batman.  Everything was rich and awesome.  Cream and butter ruled the meal. Classic, well prepared and super enjoyable. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We went there last week for our Anniversary and the food was absolutely amazing. The appetizer (Mussels) and both entrees were delicious. Of course the desert was very good too. I will definitely be back.  We had a very nice and knowledgeable waitress."}
{"text":"The Barramundi was superb tonight! New menu; same great quality!! Service was personal and complete. Will be back."}
{"text":"*Sigh* the high reviews made me try this place.  Leaving the Spa on Saturday I Yelp'd \"Oysters and Steamed Shrimp\" from my current location, High Tide Seafood Bar & Grill came up first.  I read a few reviews and decided to give them a try.  I sat at the bar because I was alone and immediately ordered a glass of house wine, half dozen order of oysters and lobster bisque. I was expecting steamed or spice shrimp but the Shrimp Boil here is not like the Shrimp Boil you're used to, it was more so shrimp steamed in a tomato Cajun broth, more like a shrimp soup.  

I received my oysters within 10 minutes of ordering.  Also within 10 minutes 2 different servers came to up to me (directly next to me) and asked if I ended anything else.  A little overkill.  The oysters were OUT OF THIS WORLD good and I especially like the happy hour prices of them $1.75 a pop.  The lobster bisque was pretty tasty but didn't taste very authentic.  It was quite filling so I didn't have room for anything else but I looked over the menu and noticed a few items I wanted to try for the next time. 

I came back the very next day with the significant other, we sat at the bar again because it was reservations only (Mother's Day).  I didn't get oysters this time because they weren't on happy hour and I didn't want to pay $17 bucks for them.  This time I ordered a cup of clam chowder.  Per the bartender's recommendations, we shared an order of calamari and crab, cheesy garlic bread.  Well .... This time was pretty disappointing.  The Clam Chowder taste like it came out of a can.  It sort of taste like Potato Soup with Clam.  It was a yellow-beige colored thick soup, not white and creamy.  Thick like cream of chicken soup in the can and pretty much the same color.  The calamari, although the bartender said it's freshly cut in the back, clearly was not.  They tasted EXACTLY like fish sticks.  They taste no difference then something you'd pick up in the grocery store.  The crab, garlic bread saved the day.  It taste like bread topped with Crab Imperial.  It was pretty tasty!  

We noticed way too many dishes (seafood towers and oysters) sit at the bar for far too long.  We noticed the cooks using what looked like frozen calamari rings for the steam pots.  We didn't' enjoy the overbearing server.  She was nice but it's weird for your server to check on you and take your order by walking up from behind you or sitting next to you. We noticed how agitated and irritated the guy shucking the oysters was (huffing and puffing, slamming pots, when asked a question from a server, he mouthed her off when she left), all of which turned us off from dinner.  So after eating our appetizers and boxing up the rest we decided to leave.  Not sure if I'll return.  I'm sure I can find better."}
{"text":"Food is very good and they have some interesting cocktails. I do not go anywhere else in Gilbert if I'm looking for seafood. Quality is excellent, calamari steaks are great."}
{"text":"Absolutely blown away with the service , the food , the cocktails .. It was over the top amazing experience!!  Seafood was as fresh as it comes, the posters were succulent & sweet!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times for lunch(1X) and dinner many. Wednesday half off glasses wine and was awesome tonight. Will need to show up again for this in the future. Everything have had here has been amazing. The cippoino is my favorite  but everything here is awesome but the Beer Steamed Clams I would recommend.  They were gritty and nasty so never order again. Thankfully will visit again if not on a Wednesday on Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and excellent food.  Wife got the cioppino and I the spicy seafood pasta.  Both were packed with flavor. Kids got the fish and chips and the famous fried chicken.  Both have two thumbs up.  Overall great food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Sorry but I was not impressed. The Crab macaroni n cheese was delicious, and that's it. Everything else was average. I would still have given this place a 3 Stars, however the service was awful. 

The hostess assured us that she'd come get us while we went the the Bar and ordered some appetizers, an hour and half later, we just left after eating uncomfortably on the high chairs."}
{"text":"I hadn't been feeling well, and the main courses looked like too much food, so I ordered a salad and added grilled shrimp to it. I'm not big on salad entrees, but...   

It was one of the top 10 salads I've ever had in my life! Shucks! Maybe one of the top Three! 

My salad was Golden Beets, Goat Cheese, Strawberries, Spinach and Candied Pecans. Plus my shrimp. Every bite was delicious. Every bite had a different texture and different flavor. Even the vinaigrette was especially delicious. 

Our server was good. She paid attention.

I'm going to eat my way through this menu."}
{"text":"We've enjoyed going to this restaurant since it first opened. The appetizers are all incredible and I recently tried the crab garlic cheese bread and it's OUTSTANDING! We also really like the gumbo and spicy seafood pasta. They make a good dirty martini with blue cheese olives and their wine list is great as well. We will continue to come here regularly and also love seeing how involved the owners are."}
{"text":"Where has this place been all of my desert life? Everything they've given me to put in my mouth has been amazing. I would compare their Lobster Bisque to World Famous in San Diego. Fish and Chips are killer. $2 Fish Tacos on Monday are terrific. Cioppino is a pleaser. Seabass, excellent. For the non-seafoodie, Famous Fried Chicken hits the spot. Service is great as well."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to The High Tide. We went for lunch on a Monday. We had several surprises, first the restaurant was nearly empty, 3 other parties (two of them eating at the bar) and us. There was a \"seat yourself\" sign as we arrived but we were intercepted by a woman who asked our preference and seated us. 

It turns out she was also our waitress (Deborah), the only one, which was the second surprise, the service was good in spite of the one waitress/hostess. Our second surprise was the portion size...large, larger than expected.

The third surprise was the quality. We ordered the calamari appetizer. A large plate of panko crusted long, finger sized pieces cooked to perfection....meaning crunchy on the outside and very tender on the inside. As an appetizer, it was enough for two. It was so good, I was thinking about canceling lunch and just ordering more calamari. 

For entrees we had the Fish and Chips and Gumbo. Both were excellent, the fish was sitting on a large bed of fries (a mix of crispy sweet potato fries and white potato and the sweet potato fries were actually crisp!) There were three large pieces of fish and a large portion of housemade Coleslaw made with peaches and cashews. 

The gumbo had a large portion of shrimp, balanced with andouille sausage, okra, onions, celery ...all the fixins except bell peppers (suits me, they over power everything they're in). I chose dirty rice. This is the best gumbo I've eaten. Portion size was \"large\" and could easily fill me at my hungriest. 

Although we were taking unfinished food home, we decided to split a \"bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream.\"  

It seemed to take forever and I was beginning to think the good service had fallen off...but I was surprised again. The Bread Pudding was hot from the oven (not the microwave) and was crusty on top with a soft smooth custard soaked bread underneath. Extraordinary....along with a first rate vanilla ice cream to complement it. 

The High Tide isn't inexpensive. We had one appetizer, two entrees, one dessert, one beverage. The total was $50 including tax but not tip. 

We will return...too good not too..."}
{"text":"If I could give more stars,  I would.  This place is AMAZING!!  Always drove by and thought it was another \"strip mall\" restaurant.  Holy surprised!!  Service was awesome,  ambiance was awesome,  and food was even better!  Our group shared a few appetizers.  Lobster mac n cheese was HUGE,  flavorful,  and had a fair amount of lobster in it.  Calamari was so good and came with two dipping sauces that left me wanting so much more.  Fish and chips were prob the best I've ever had and the wings!!!  These were the biggest wings I have ever seen!!!  So impressed with this place and will def be back!"}
{"text":"Really good.  My wife is from Seattle so she rarely wants to go for seafood in AZ but friends told us High Tide was good so we tried it.  Huge portions (fish and chips, shrimp cocktail, crab cake, calamari).  Priced very well (especially in happy hour), Jenny was out server she was very friendly and engaging.  The owner was walking around checking on customers and knew many, this is a really nice touch we enjoyed talking with him and could tell he is passionate about his business,  customers and employees.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service & awesome atmosphere. I loved the calamari & lobster mac & cheese."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Fresh seafood in the valley at a good price is/was hard to find. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon in time for the Bloody Mary bar. I've been looking for a fun, full of goodies, delicious Bloody Mary .  This was it. So on Saturday and Sunday, I believe 11-3  it is available. We then ordered the high tide combo. Loaded with oysters, mussels, clams, 5 large shrimp and 2 king crab legs. Heaven! Our plan was to try a steam pot but we were  to full. We were full, but not to full to share a delicious bread pudding with ice cream. Beware. It's a huge dessert.  Couldn't finish it but brought  half the pudding home .(ate all the ice cream)
Bottom line.... we will return
I must not forget to mention the help. Fun and friendly."}
{"text":"Not kid friendly at all!!! We hadn't even been seated yet and the waitress gave me a hard time about getting a high chair which they had several stacked in front for my 8 month old. When I asked to talk to the manager he came out and said it was the law in Gilbert that they can't sit high chairs at booths. Which I have never heard or had any other restaurants give me a hard time The manager made it clear that they really didn't want us there with an infant. He was quiet and we had brought his snacks and sippy cup. There were maybe 5 tables filled for lunch so it's not like they were crazy busy and would trip over the high chair in a completely open area. We were excited to try this restaurant but felt not welcome and left."}
{"text":"OMG! I've been here 3 times and each time I ordered something different. I have never been disappointed. My favorite is the salmon. It is to die for."}
{"text":"I don't just hand out 5 star reviews because I didn't throw up, you've got to truly impress me.  Color me impressed.  Amazing seafood in the desert sounds like a joke, and usually a bad one, not here.  OMG.  To start, the lobster mac and cheese is so good that I could have eaten that for dinner and been perfectly happy.  I had the ciopilo (spelling? I can't say it right either, but you'll see it on the menu and know what I'm talking about), which is a seafood stew with mussels, clams, shrimp, and fish in a white wine broth.  It was so good that I was fully prepared to turn up my bowl and chug the rest of the broth after I ate all the bits out of it.  The people sitting in the booth across the aisle from us probably wouldn't have appreciated that too much.  So I had to reign in my inner raccoon and pretend to have at least some semblance of decency, but I really wanted to lap it up.  I was so stuffed that I'm kinda glad they stopped me though.  I would have liked to try the bread pudding that all the Yelp reviewers raved about, but it just wasn't physically possible.  This place is expensive, but worth the money.  The prices are better for lunch, and they give a pretty good break on costs for happy hour.  I can't afford dinner here without serious misgivings, I mean, I've got bills to pay.  But I'm all about lunch.  If you want to impress somebody, bring them here and you will succeed!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here Friday night for happy hour! They have a great selection of seafood for a much cheaper price! We ordered a 1/2 dozen raw oysters, steamed shrimp, lobster mac and cheese which only came out to be $36! I was only disappointed that the shrimp were very small, about the size of a quarter. I thought they would be medium sized or maybe even jumbo. :(

The servers were very friendly as well as the cooks who prepared food right in front of us in these jacketed steam kettles! It was such a fun first time experience to see the live process. Also great ambiance and sea-inspired interior design."}
{"text":"And the third (or 5th) time is a charm! Busy night, superb service. Food was on point as always. Do yourself a favor and sir in Ari's section if you can."}
{"text":"On a Friday night at 9pm, we were seated right away, the food was nothing short of Amazing, so so good (we had the Salmon BLT & the Warm Arugula and Kale Salad).  4 Star as this isn't necessarily inexpensive (its rating at $$ 2 dollar signs is more like 3) BUT that said... never regrettable, worth it!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with reasonable prices. All the seafood we ordered was fresh and cooled perfectly. The sides were delicious and the beignets were amazing. Happy hour on top of it all left us with an indescribably perfect evening."}
{"text":"Wow!!  Super good, clean, friendly, steam pots so fun to watch!.incredible portions, great price!!got to try this!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the calamari, lobster bisque and caesar salad. Husband had fish and chips--he loved it. Yummy!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out for our anniversary. As Oregon natives we miss fresh seafood. 

We started with the lobster Mac after looking around and realizing almost every table had a plate of it. It had good flavor and there was plenty to split. While it was good, with the price tag attached id rather get the Crab cakes or something with much more seafood. 

We ordered half a dozen oysters and while they were really great, the hot sauce is amazing, our server had forgot to put the order in so we waited close 20 minutes for them because our server forgot to place the order. 

We decided to split as meal because we were filling up. We went for the halibut with a leek sauce and mashed potatoes with beets the fish was over cooked a bit but the sauce was great. My only real disappointment was with the potato/beets, they were very sweet and it didn't mesh well with the dish. 

Overall the food was good but the service could have been better. Quick to take order, slow to bring food."}
{"text":"Wow this is my favorite restaurant!!! I live in North Scottsdale and have been looking for a restaurant like this, I drive 45 mins just to eat at this restaurant. I wish they would open a location in Scottsdale! The best appetizers are the cheese and sausage plate, the Cajun shrimp is AMAZING , not to spicy but a little sweet; it goes perfect with bread for dipping. The sea bass and halibut are excellent! The only thing I would change would be the red beans and rice, they are way to spicy. They should make them mild and the customers could always add hot sauce to them to make them spicier."}
{"text":"Another bad review! I believe her name is Ryan. Very bad customer service. Worse thing ever to have bad attitude as your 1st impression. High Tide please re-train or re-think your hiring especially your people facing employees. Bad posture, slouching, no smile, rudeness. It was so bad we left ...."}
{"text":"Went for their happy hour for the second time Saturday night and being very early for dinner, it was still pretty packed. Their happy hour menu is great and portions are huge! Ordered the lobster mac and cheese, beer broth clams, and beignets. The clams are so fresh and they give you so many for only $10 on the happy hour menu. I wouldn't order the beignets again since I've had way better. Everything was going smoothly until the mac and cheese. This dish tastes great and again portions were very generous so we ended up bringing the rest home. When I went to eat the leftovers I noticed a flat piece almost like a large piece of cheese, but when I went to eat it it was so hard and spit it out. It looks like the cap to something made from very hard plastic. It definitely wasn't something edible. I would continue going to this restaurant, but I hope the kitchen is a little more careful preparing the food because the idea of my food being cooked with plastic in it leaves a bad taste in my mouth since now all I can think about is bpa-this-that. Wish I had found this while at the restaurant to be able to point it out then."}
{"text":"I am so happy to finally have a seafood place here in the East Valley.  High Tide gets a few things VERY right.  Let's start off with the beer selection featuring Green Flash IPA, Firestone Walker DBA and IPA and several other selections from Stone and other top notch breweries.  Next up are the oysters which are fresh and shucked very well.  They usually try and carry an East and West coast oyster which is cool to split and taste the amazing variety.  I'm a huge fan of their quality and they are served correctly with lemon and three sauces based on your taste.  A cocktail with a huge chunk of fresh horseradish, a shallot vinaigrette, and a creamy horseradish.  I just use the chunk horseradish and lemon and it is wonderful.  .  

The other day I had a dz raw oysters and an oyster poboy which was also amazing.  A little heavy on the bread but the oysters and the pickles etc were spot on.  The fried okra was a nice add and something I have not seen in restaurants in years.  

The prices are reasonable considering the size of the place and the high level of freshness they provide in the food.  This brings me to the only possible negative which is a lack of warmth in the restaurant.  Perhaps they just need some plants and filler but it is a large open space with high ceilings and you feel somewhat like you are at a museum.  The booths seem a little too \"old school\" for me but no matter because I think the huge bar is the only place to sit.  You can also watch them make some of the foods in very cool steam pots they have right there in the bar.  

Service is a notch above most with staff that are well educated and a little more mature than you would normally find in a AZ restaurant.  Service usually shines here from people with a deep understanding of the food and drink.

Lastly they need a bike rack outside being right in the center of town.  It's an easy ride for many within the area and they have a huge windowed area where people can keep an eye on things.  Would love to cruise over for some oysters and beer and dash home without putting a key in the car.  I hope to see one by the time fall arrives.  

Nice work High Tide!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I love the decoration and the ambience of this place. Modern yet casual."}
{"text":"If you love seafood, you have to stop here! Stay away from that awful chai n restaurant, come here you will have made a great life choice with this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and decided to try it based on all the good ratings. I was craving some good seafood and wanted to try a new place. The location itself is really beautiful and the atmosphere is very nice. The place also doesn't smell fishy when you walk in the door like a lot of seafood places tend to.

Service was good. The hostess and our server Ariana were both very pleasant. Our server was really good about making suggestions and letting us know about the happy hour menu options available. The bad part, unfortunately was the food.

I started off with an appetizer of the calamari. I have never seen it in long strips before but in the usual thin, round slices. Visually, it looked nice but the taste was bland. Even with adding a little lemon juice, it didn't quite have the right taste you expect for calamari.

I ordered the King: A pasta dish which has king crab, scallops, baked salmon, calamari, mushrooms and roasted tomatoes. I immediately knew that this dish would be a disappointment. The saffon sauce had a slightly sour aftertaste which was really off-putting. The scallops, salmon, calamari and mushrooms were the best part of the dish. The star of the dish, the king crab, was dry. The tomatoes in the dish were strange- they did nothing to enhance the flavor and it confused the dish. The worst part is that halfway through eating it, the cream sauce broke. There's nothing worse than sifting through spoonfuls of oil during your meal and for $28 this is unacceptable.

I don't think I will be returning to High Tide again. Although the service was good the food is extremely overpriced and very underwhelming."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. The happy hour is outstanding! Love this place will definitely return."}
{"text":"Wait staff awful. Slow service. Had to flag the server down to get anything ordered several times.  Food was good, not great. Angry Crab blows this place away imo."}
{"text":"The deep fried calamari was bland with the processed squid but their beer steamed clams with the pancetta and onions was better.  The crispy chicken wings were crispy and tasty!"}
{"text":"High tide is probably the best seafood within 5 miles of my house. I have never had a bad meal there. The oysters are on point and they always seem to have a special that I have never been disappointed with. They have an odd but delicious type of wings where they utilize a dry rub on their chicken and the wings are not a typical wing in regards to size. The waitstaff has always been very attentive and the management is always around greeting me the guests. Hats off to the chef who knows his seafood."}
{"text":"Delicious, Delicious!!!!!
Or should I say Double D? Last time I said that candy jumped off the stage and stopped dancing! Oh Tartar sauce, where was I??? Oh yeah the review! The Pots are amazing and the desserts are worth staying for! All I can say is \"Suit Up\" and take a date!"}
{"text":"Oh this is such a gem to find and enjoy.  The food is amazing and very fresh seafood. The oysters so fresh and a great size!  All of the entrees where so good! The happy hour menu is great and the service is certainly top notch. Sara A. Is great and very knowledgeable about the menu.  We will for sure be back!!"}
{"text":"Came in about 15 minutes before closing hoping to grab a quick bite. No issues they were doing all the closing duties but didn't bat an eye! 
Service was good and the food was al yummy. We had he ahi tostadas which were the best! Clam chowder was good a little too potatoey for me but still tastey."}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be awesome, but falls short due to service and food quality. 

My friend and I were seated by hostesses that were less than enthusiastic about being there. We were ignored by multiple servers for 7 minutes before someone came to greet us. We asked for water and those took another 3 minutes. It's a Tuesday night. I can't imagine the bar was so slammed they couldn't fill a couple water glasses. 

The server listed off the ingredients of the special then walked away. We had to call her back to order an appetizer and a glass of wine. Beware- they're tricky about their \"house wine\" special. None of the wines that are on the wine menu work for happy hour. 

The soup was the only memorable part of this dinner. I had clam chowder and my friend had lobster bisque. I can understand why people would rave about this restaurant since it's slim pickings for quality seafood in the desert, but based on tonight's experience I will be continuing my search elsewhere."}
{"text":"Shared a terrific meal with the family tonight at High Tide. We enjoyed the garlic cheese bread for appetizers, thoroughly enjoyed 2 orders of the honey fried chicken and mashed potatoes, a the tasty, monster hamburger and fries, the beautiful spinach salad with grilled shrimp and the always awesome tide roast steam pot. Rounded off the meal with an order of beignets and the family of five couldn't be more happy or content. Thanks for such a wonderful dining experience: great food, service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of great things about High Tide and finally tried the place out. So glad I did because it was amazing. I had the ceviche which is only seasonal in the summer months but hands down it was the best ceviche I've ever had. It's on the starters and shareable menu but I ordered it as my entrée and ended up taking half of it home - more for later, yay! While the food was amazing I have to say the staff really stood out to me. Our server was Arianna and she was GREAT!! In addition to that though, all the servers, bus boys, even managers help each other out there. We never had a dirty plate sitting long and our water glasses were always filled. It's not something you really take notice of until you have such great service like High Tide does. Awesome job team, I can't wait to come back and try some more food!"}
{"text":"Lunch was awesome. I had soup lobster bisque and spinach and beet salad. My husband had The enchiladas and they were delicious. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Just introduced our MN friends to High Tides ! YUM- meal and service were incredible as always and bonus Wednesday nights are wine night - awesome"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Chuck E. Baby was playing, beer was cold and food was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Great selection---excellent service.....So glad they are here in Gilbert :)"}
{"text":"Finally, a good seafood restaurant in the valley, and right here in little Gilbert, Arizona! I love everything about High Tide, the location, the pretty decor, the ambience, and most importantly the food. My husband and I enjoyed a date night here recently. I started my meal off with the Baby Spinach and Golden Beet Salad. It was delicious and I love the way the goat cheese melted right in with the pecans and champagne vinaigrette. Then I ordered the Tide Roast as my main meal. It was just as yummy, with its creamy broth and white rice. You might think that's a strange pairing, but it really works and melds together wonderfully. My husband ordered the Lobster Bisque and \"The King\". Both dishes were equally as delicious as mine. If you're looking for a good seafood restaurant that's more than just the typical seafood joint, give High Tide a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Orange Roughy was good but risotto was only luke warm. Strange because the fish was nice and hot. Service was good but I don't care to have personal tattoos flashed in my face. Not a fan of servers commenting on whether I eat all my food and how fast I eat it. No salad so a little overpriced for me. For $16 I expect at least a piece of bread or salad. No excuses please. 50/50 chance of returning. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best seafood in AZ! The oysters are so good, the calamari is beyond amazing! And their HH is fantastic."}
{"text":"Fantastic menu!  Everyone at our table of seven loved their meal, excellent service, and wonderful happy hour specials!  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of the best seafood places we have tried, and prices are good value for great food."}
{"text":"Just returned home from having a pre-Dads day dinner. 

Had wanted to try since opening, hesitant as did not read any reviews, on purpose. Had a couple of friends say they liked it so we went.

Let's say that I am somewhat of a seafood snob.  I know what good food is and this place was great. Started with oysters on half shell, they had some different type from New York. Normally I will only eat NW oysters but decided to give these east coast guys a shot on advice of the Bar Manager. He was correct, they were pretty good.
Main course did not disappoint either. Of our selections both were authentic and well prepared.

Would I go again...Yes."}
{"text":"So good. Seriously. Came here last night for my boyfriends birthday because he loves seafood, unfortunately I'm allergic to most. He loved everything. I had the chicken and it was to die for. Weird part was the lighting, super bright cafeteria feel to the place... Could definitely benefit from some dimmer lights for a more sophisticated feel."}
{"text":"This place is great if you love great fresh seafood.  We never got past the appetizer menu.  Oysters on the half shell (three choices) outstanding, steamed clams  in broth which were made more delicious with the addition of the High Tide Hot Sauce, and calamari- best I have had.  We sat at the bar and watched the chef prepare the steam pots.  Everyone sitting there conversed and compared the dishes they were eating.  One couple was raving about the lobster mac and cheese.
The servings were large, the service was great, and the seafood fresh.  We will go back soon, and have already decided which things on the menu we want to try next."}
{"text":"We have come here twice now and will definitely be going back again.  The first time, my husband and I ordered two cups of chowda' (deeelicious, the best in town) and The King to share (and still couldn't finish it all!) 

Today we returned with our families to celebrate Mother's Day and were amazed by their superb quality of both food and service yet again.  The five of us shared the shrimp cocktail and lobster mac 'n cheese to start.  Oh my, those shrimps were huge! And the LM&C was generously portioned with healthy chunks of lobster throughout. We really couldn't stay out of it, it was so good.  

We tried the Bloody Mary bar and were not disappointed there either.  The \"customization\" options available were impressive. You have a choice between what kind of Mary mix to add (spicy or not), and then there was two different kinds of olives to choose from, sweet pickles, asparagus,  and more!  Lots of sauces were available to add in as well, not to mention the Mary started off with having a slab of bacon inside the cup. Yum. Honestly, it could have been a meal in itself.

Got the fish and chips and found the fish to be perfectly crisp on the outside,  not overbreaded, very airy and light breading actually,  and flavorful,  tender fish inside.  The tartar sauce was great, and the fries were served as a combination of shoestring and sweet potato fries. Loved the inventiveness of changing up a regular old side of fries. The slaw was fresh and included nuts and fruit.

My mother-in-law raved about her shrimp boil and my mom gt a Caesar salad and clam \"chowda\". The waiter tonight was great,  very accommodating even when my.mom changed her entree choice about 10 minutes before the food came out. Also, since it was Mother's day,  she and my mother in law were served complimentary mimosas. What a nice touch! 

The prices are a little high, yes, but I have no problem when their quality is as high and consistent as it is.  Expect to make a reservation on their busier nights (Friday/Saturday) become it gets packed and we found out he hard way last Friday.  That's ok, this joint is worth everything and more, and I have a feeling Gilbert has a new fish restaurant (finally) that's here to stay."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, I really enjoy going to small businesses with great concepts. Our server, Summer, may have been the most entertaining and enjoyable persons we have ever met.

The HighTide combo rivals any seafood tower quality at half the price.

Halibut was very moist and the sauce was incredible.

Highly recommend going here for top notch seafood that won't kill your wallet."}
{"text":"Excellent! Worth the price of the meals. Try the lobster Mac and cheese, but be prepared it's HUGE and delicious!! I had Spicy seafood pasta and hubby had the gumbo. Huge portions, excellently prepared. You will not be disappointed. It is a lot more high end than Angry Crab (more like a restaurant vibe than a true crab shack) So if you don't want to get dirty eating your seafood stop by this place and enjoy without the bib and extra napkins!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant week review

First off, this was a loooong drive.  But I went out of my way based on yelp reviews and a great sounding menu.

I ordered the ahi tuna pokè and my date had the steamed black mussels.  Of course we shared!  I had to try as much as possible! Lol. My pokè tasted good (not great...especially compared to Hawaii, but hey, this is Arizona!) but geez the color was so unappealing.  It looked like it had been out way too long and oxidized.  The mussels?  Overcooked.  Waaaaayyyy overcooked.  We didn't even eat them after the initial tasting.
 
So now the entree, drum roll please....I got the HT roast which had shrimp, mussels, crawfish and half a lobster tail in a cream broth with rice and my date ordered the Cioppino, which has shrimp, mussels, clams, fish and calamari.  The HT roast was OK.  The mussels were overcooked again but the shrimp were perfect.  However, my date hated his dish.  Really hated it.  Everything overcooked and they used the same broth that is used in the mussels app and just added tomato.  He was not happy.

Service was slow but this review is based on food only.  We asked for our deserts to go go and got half portions for it.  That really sucked.  It was literally half of what I saw was served to other diners.  Kind of bummed that this place wasn't better for us.  Overall, glad I tried it.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"The best seafood restaurant I've ever been too! Absolutely amazing, super fresh food, and they have happy hour everyday with really good choices! I could seriously eat here everyday it's that good!!! So glad there's a good seafood restaurant in Gilbert! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"After our second visit there, my wife and I can both say that we love this place!  No fresher seafood that I've tasted in AZ, and they have such a wonderful variety from lobster mac, fresh oysters, and great steampots.  Overall, what I love the most is the experience.  It really feels like you leave Gilbert for a bit and are transported to the coast.  It's a nice escape!  The owner Chris was extremely warm and welcoming and made our Anniversary celebration very special!  Looking forward to coming back for the Bloody Mary bar, and spending some Sundays watching football here!  Don't miss out some of the freshest seafood in the Valley, we need to keep places like this in business!"}
{"text":"I want this to be our Go To place because it's so close to our home. But alas, it's not to be. 
The biggest issue is the flavor is just OK on all the food. We've tried a couple of items, like the gumbo, the seafood pots, and the fish. They all lacked real flavor. Like they are too afraid to spice it up! 
Couple this with the high prices and it's just a No Go.
Maybe if they made the Happy Hour a better deal, we would try again. But at this point, I think High Tide is off the list."}
{"text":"There was a little wait upon arrive which is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars. Will definitely make a reservation in the future. Food was absolutely delicious. Must try the lobster mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Excellant food and service by very attentive staff! The best of the best in seafood! We will be back to sample some more of there food and excellant service!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, clean, great staff, and the food was terrific. Even some of my kids appreciated the vegetables and how often does that happen?"}
{"text":"Food is very good but ambiance is not on par with the food and prices. Expected something much fancier, has more of a deli feel. It is expensive, had to ask if prices were in Yen or Dollar!"}
{"text":"Had the Lobster Mac and cheese. It was great. Melissa had Mussels and she really liked them. We tried the Calamari and the batter was so thick, you couldn't taste any Calamari. It was more like a Mozzarella stick.
We had a lousy waiter. He spent most of his time socializing. Had to flag him down to get more water. He never checked on us, didn't bring our food, get our to go boxes, or take a plate. He finally showed up to ask if we wanted dessert. After we asked for the check, he disappeared again. About 15 minutes later he's talking to a table behind me. I tapped him on the arm and said hey where's our check? He said I'll have it in a minute. It took another 15 minutes. He was just taking his time bullshitting with people. So I left no tip, and if I ever go back, I'll call ahead and order to go. But I doubt that we ever go back."}
{"text":"I'm breaking my no review policy, because this place is just that good. I have eaten here multiple times now and I can say hands down the freshest seafood that I have had in a long time. And it's in the middle of the desert Gilbert AZ.

Ciopino is out of this world! Shrimp po boy was amazing. Halibut sandwich at lunch was huge. And last but not least the fish and chips were on point!

Oyster selection is forever rotating and it is always super fresh and tasty varieties. Ha went had a bad oyster yet there and I have put down a few dozen."}
{"text":"Yes, yes and another yes! This place was recommended by a friend. As I am from California I have pretty high standards on seafood. I will definitely be returning and plan to bring my California family members with me on their next visit to town. Why? Fresh oysters on the happy hour menu, gorgeous ambiance, friendly staff, fast service, affordable pricing and superb drinks. The only reason its not a five star review is because they were a little heavy with the ice in our drinks. Otherwise I couldn't be happier. Our server was Justice and he definitely did us JUSTICE. Super attentive, offered great suggestions and very friendly. Loved the oysters from Morro Bay, CA , crab cakes, blueberry mojito, high tide combo, deep fried avocado and beignets. Give this place a chance to woo you."}
{"text":"I just got takeout, so I will edit my review once I go for a sit down meal!

I ordered the \"king\" seafood pasta. It was pretty good, but not as much food as I was expecting for the price. I did get a roll and butter in my to-go bag, which was a nice touch! My biggest complaint is that I couldn't find any crab in my pasta... that's the main reason I ordered it! 

But the restaurant itself is fun and busy, and the girls at the front were very helpful and kind. Looking forward to trying it again... hopefully on the weekend to see the bloody mary bar!"}
{"text":"I am not a big seafood fan so take it as it is but this place was really good. We hit the happy hour (which is cool they have it even on Sat) and basically ordered only off that menu, as prices were ok there ~$10 each item.

Lobster mac and cheese: very tasty mac and cheese and plenty to share although not much lobster in it that i found, beer steamed clams: very tasty broth and onions and bacon bits in the mix and calamari: long strips vs curly cues plays tricks with your mind that you are gonna eat mozzarella sticks but very tender and tasty. Bread they have are little sourdough balls which are good as well. Drinks are fair price on happy hour and have some local brews on tap.

Also tried other folks food at the table :red beans and rice: has good sausage and meat and cheese plate: good but nothing crazy there.

Overall nice looking place, good tasting food and a must at happy hour. I am sure if i was paying full price my review would be a bit different."}
{"text":"I barely found this awesome place near work. I've only tried the clam chowder and the crab mac and cheese,  WORTH IT! Oh my goodness this New England clam chowder is AMAZING! Full of bursting flavors I was very surprised. mac and cheese -huge pieces of crab, pretty big serving. Will be back soon; )"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! We celebrated my dad's birthday, and had a big party. Our server was awesome. The food was delicious like always. We ordered oysters & mussels for our appetizer. Everything was fresh and very good. I ordered my favorite for my entree which is always amazing! (the cioppino) Everyone's dishes looked so good and everyone was happy with their meals. We saved a little room for the bread pudding and it was also delish!"}
{"text":"I took my mother and my daughter for dinner here and it was our first visit.  I chose this place because they both really like seafood and it has a nice menu.  It was my mother's last night in Phoenix as she's moving the very next to Florida.  

The evening started nice but quickly went downhill.  My mother ordered a salad to start and I ordered a cup of soup.  We ordered our entrees too and we both ordered the Jumbo Seared Scallop.  The waitress informed us that the scallops would be lightly seared and so would not be fully cooked.  She wanted to make sure we were aware and we both said it was fine.  We did specifically asked for our salad and soup to come out first.

Moments later another waiter came with our entrees.  My mother pointed out that we were supposed to have our salad and soup first.  The waitress then came and apologized but offered us two choices: 1) have our salad/soup with our entrees at the same time or 2) have our soup/salad while they hold our entrees to be warmed up later.  My mother said no to either.  We don't feel comfortable having seafood entrees sitting there while we finish our salad/soup.  So they agreed to make fresh entrees for us.

My soup was great (hence the 3 stars).  When our entrees arrived, I felt my scallop were more cooked than what the waitress described but I liked it just fine (again reason for the 3 stars).  But my mother said her scallops were definitely overcooked.  And especially after the waitress made sure we were prepared for the scallops not to be fully cooked, it was a big deal.  It was an expensive entree.  It should be perfect.  

Here's the biggest disappointment and really unacceptable experience.  After my mother alerted the waitress that her scallops were overcooked, the manager came to talk to us.  He was extremely argumentative and combative.  Rather just simply acknowledging and offering alternatives, he was saying how their scallops were fresh and not frozen like other restaurants.  He said they threw away the previous entree and this was fresh although my mother made no reference whatsoever suggesting they reheated the previous entree.  He said because the scallops were fresh the texture was different and that's why she would think they were overcooked...as if we couldn't tell cooked vs uncooked scallops.  

For a manager, especially a manager at a supposedly high end restaurant, I expected a much better customer service skills.  My mother did not ask for anything.  She just said the scallops were overcooked.  For him to argue with her was unacceptable.  He ruined the dinner for us.  My mother did not eat the scallops and naturally said she would not pay for it.  

The waitress was very apologetic and demonstrated a much better customer service skills compared to that manager.  

My food and my daughter's food were ok, and that's why I'm giving 3 stars.  But the manager's attitude was unacceptable."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and the amount of stars it had I was excited to try it. I was pretty disappointed. The menu didn't seem to have much it kinda felt stumped on a few entrees. The service was slow and it wasn't even busy. We went on a Sunday afternoon it was not busy at all, yet the service very slow"}
{"text":"Over priced happy hour but  really good restaurant. Finally offer bowls in lunch size all day. The large ones were huge and way pricey."}
{"text":"Great meal, great service.  Glad to have a great place to have seafood in the south valley!"}
{"text":"If you choose wisely and the stars are aligned, High Tide can be a five star experience.  The greeting you get when you enter sets the tone. Bravo for making us feel so welcome.  I recommend Blue Point Oysters for an appetizer.  They were amazing!  Better than many I've had in NY and southern Connecticut where the Blue Point clams are harvested!  

Our server was excellent, personable and 100% accurate with our order.  All of our entrees were received at the same time.  Points are deserved there too.  Each distinct flavor to each dish was a wonderful treat for the tastebuds.  The crispy fish and fries were delicious.  The Gumbo accompanied by dirty rice was out of this world.
My mother in law loved her scallops and the portion was good. Nobody had any room for dessert and we all had left overs to take home!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent first experience this week at High Tides..love this place!! Greeted by a staff of very friendly people and John was so helpful with his suggestions on what to order. The seafood was delicious and I thought the Mussles in Beer were very tasty without any grit...if you're a seafood eater, you know what I mean!! Big tasty shrimp and wonderful calamari! The Lobster bisque = a party in my mouth!! The decor and cleanliness make for a beautiful environment. The prices are very reasonable and the HH was extremely reasonable! Looking forward to my next visit!!"}
{"text":"We ate there last evening with a large group in their private back room. I had the seafood gumbo with dirty rice (white was an option) and it was excellent. It was flavorful but not overly spiced and I could taste the flavor of all the ingredients including the shrimp, very well balanced. My girlfriend had the halibut with a beurre blanc sauce that was also excellent. Very mild which she prefers but very flavorful and she was especially complimentary of the potatoes that were served with the fish. We didn't have any dessert. No one with us had a complaint about their meal. The service was good and the atmosphere was casual but appropriate. They had a singer performing live music and he was good as well. Honestly, I've been very disappointed in the past with the quality of seafood restaurants here in the East Valley. This is by far the best one that we've encountered and we intend to eat there again. I hope that as they continue to grow they expand their beverage menu. It would have been nice to have a better selection of wine and beer but if I recall correctly it was all available by the glass and we ordered during happy hour which made the price very affordable. :) Looking forward to trying other offerings and hoping they are as good or better!"}
{"text":"Great food and large portions. Nice atmosphere too.  Looks like a small hole In the wall , but it's not, the  food and atmosphere are very upscale."}
{"text":"Great staff, amazing food and great bartender. My go-to date spot for when I'm trying to seem like a baller. I like the fried chicken a lot, braised short rib is swell as well, but they have the best seafood in all of Gilbert! Great pairings, great place to try new and interesting dishes, the chefs they have are artists and craftsmen (whichever is more positive to them, I respect the hell out of them). It's tremendous."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night and it was very good.  There were some low points but mostly high points.  We started with the high tide sampler which had 1/2lb king crab legs, some mussels, clams, 3 oysters, and shrimp cocktail.  They advertised 1/2lb king crab legs but they only brought 2 claws out, and they were small ones.  Not sure if they even weighed half of that, but the meat inside was decent.  The mussels, clams and shrimp were good.  My main complaint with the sampler was the 3 oysters.  They are the restaurant choice and we were told they are day old oysters and not the fresh ones.  They certainly tasted that way and were definitely not good.  Given that it was a $40 dish, I would have expected fresh oysters and not old ones, especially since they did not taste good.

Our party ordered several dishes such as the King, Louisiana gumbo, Tide roast steam pots, and the black cod special.  The food was fairly delicious and helped make up where the sampler bombed.  They also charged you $1 for 2 sourdough dinner rolls.  I think for a high end restaurant, you should at least give the first roll to each person free, then charge if they ask for more.  Just a pet peeve of mine.  I heard that they have a decent happy hour and would come back to experience that."}
{"text":"This place is great, its small and super clean. The service was prompt and the food came out hot and fast. We went for lunch but I would go back for dinner as well."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the quality of the food. I was expecting good seafood since they market themselves as a seafood restaurant. The lobster bisque soup didn't taste good. They drowned out the flavor by putting too much cream in it. The halibut was too salty. The risotto was the worse I ever had... it was bland and too mushy. It taste like nothing . I never had risotto taste so terrible. 
The crab cakes were ok. It was not a good dinner."}
{"text":"We went for a birthday of a friend. We ordered the crab cake, the lobster Mac and Barramundi. The crab cake was ok, but I found shell in it. At least it's real crab meat? I was disappointed it was only 1 cake, it was a big crab cake, but just one. The lobster Mac was actually really good, that was the best thing I tried. The barramundi was eh. But for a $30 plate I want a lot better than eh. The fish seemed over cooked and the flavors didn't mix super well. Maybe it needed more sauce? Not sure. I just wasn't impressed and wouldn't go back on my own. It's over priced for the quality. The staff was pretty great though. Customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"Wow,  this place is fire!  High tide deserves five stars*****, this place is consistently great!  I've been here about 5 times, one for each star I've given and there food only speaks for itself.  The food here tastes the freshest and the service is always friendly.  I would definitely say try this place out and see for yourself.  Beware, u will spend $60+ but the difference is u know where the $ went and it's well worth it.  Surfs up at the tide!  P.S. I bring my kids here all the time without any problems"}
{"text":"We loved High Tide. Happy Hour on the patio was a great experiences. The food was amazing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The service was awesome.  Becky was so sweet and accomodating.  We ordered oyster shooters. Strong, but yummy! Had to do it. Also got the the shrimp cocktail and it was very fresh. My husband ordered the sea bass and I ordered the halibut.  Prepared very similiar...Only difference was the type of fish and the cream sauce.  He had a lemon sauce.  I had a lobster sauce.  Other than that,  they both were accompanied by risotto and grilled asparagus.  We were both happy with our dishes.  Loses one star because for a seafood place,  I feel the fish should be prepared perfectly,  but mine was a little over cooked. The chocolate martinis, however, were so good that I had three of them.  Needless to say,  we enjoyed our visit and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Delish fish, all fresh and succulent. We went on a Saturday around 5. Got right in, but we're put in a tight table in the bar, OK not so bad except I saw booths and bigger tables open. Service was OK, our gal ( I'll refrain from using her name) was a little disoriented. Might of been a bad day or she was new. Our dishes came out at different times. We specifically asked for our crab legs to be cut for the elderly guest at table, they weren't. She took the back and showed back up about 15 minutes later, after we were pretty much done. She had already brought the butter for the legs but didn't exchange it, and it was cold. But I'll just chalk this one up as a bad day for her. But she was nice and wasn't rude just seemed disoriented. But I want to eat here again and will be back as the food was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Ok, the DRINK to try
The Gardner-wonderful.. If you have people from out of town, take them here. 
The staff- Wonderful... Lobster Mac and cheese...super yummy
ok, the happy hour stated 3 to 6 pm and I ordered the special cocktail and it was full price on my bill $9 (Gardner). 
 Not sure if the Gardner is not part of the happy hour special.  
Everything else really really wonderful, top choice and full of class.
Try this place.  
Hope to see them on GROUPON soon."}
{"text":"Amazing. Coming from the East Coast we finally found a Seafood Restaurant in AZ that is wonderful."}
{"text":"Food was 4 and service was 2.  The appetizers were good (huge) and main course was OK. Wasn't cray about the \"King\" - way too much sauce. The service was slow and not very attentive."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to celebrate our anniversary. While I didn't love the food, the service was amazing! The lobster bisque was luke warm at best, however a decent size for the cup. I liked their drink menu and their appetizer menu. I think if we ever come back, we would sit at the bar and order the soup and maybe the muscles. Again, service was amazing! One thing I hate about restaurants is when the managers walk around and ask how things are going. We were asked three times by two different managers how things were going. Although a common practice, I feel like it says they do not have confidence in their servers."}
{"text":"Overall, decent meal. We ordered take away and cannot comment on the service, although our order was ready within 20 minutes. 

The salmon and risotto dish was delicious with a fresh and zesty sauce, but the sauce and risotto was more rich and creamy than my diet is used to. I recommend ordering the sauce on the side so that you can dress the salmon according to your taste.  

The lobster Mac and cheese was every bit as comforting and delicious as other yelpers have indicated. The portion is huge and can be shared as a side between 4-5 adults. 

The gumbo was not as good as the rest of the meal and I would only rate it 2/5 stars. 

I look forward to trying other foods from this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"The service as well as the food is fabulous. Definitely order the calamari! It is so delicious and different from the basic calamari you can find everywhere else. I also had the lobster mac and it could feed 4 easily! Great tasting food all around. I'll be back."}
{"text":"What a great, outta the way place with terrific character and awesome food!"}
{"text":"High Tide food is awesome! It is extremely fresh, great tasting, and good sized portions! I have no issues with the food itself. The service on the other hand is something less than desirable. It is extremely slow all around..slow to get refills, slow to get our food, and slow to get our check.  There has been he same manager on duty each time we have been there and the staff seems \"frantic/nervous\" when he is there. It made us feel uncomfortable. We have had lunch/dinner there 3 times and each visit we felt the same with the manager.  If you want great seafood, this is the place! Just know the service won't equal the food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I dine out 1-2 times a week and have tried most places in Gilbert so we know what we can expect from a Gilbert restaurant.  I found High Tide on Yelp a few months ago and decided to try it out last night with my wife.  When we arrived, the hostess was very friendly and walked us to the large centerpiece bar where we could watch the cooks preparing various seafood dishes.  About 30 seconds later, our waitress who was very friendly (I think her name was Jen?) greeted us and took our drink order.  Great selection of draft beers and the cocktail menu was very good too.  My wife had the prickled pink which was very good.  We ordered the high tide combo and the calamari appetizer and figured we would just share and graze.  It was fun to watch the chef Roger assemble the combo and pull from the big tray of various seafood kept on ice.  For the price and quality, I was very impressed.  The size of the shrimp were more like small sausages and were amazing as was everything else on the platter and very indulgent.  The calamari was a generous portion and the Old Bay Lemon Aioli was so good with it.  Only nitpick thing I can say, which is really small is when they serve the high tide combo, they should have a 4th small bowl of horseradish and not have it mixed in with the cocktail sauce.  Not a big deal at all though since they brought my wife a new cup. Based on other dishes we saw prepared you can tell they don't skimp on the seafood.  Overall food presentation is very well done.

John, the manager came out and greeted each person sitting at the bar and you can tell he likes his job because he is very good at it.  He was running around the restaurant making sure everyone felt great and cared for.  Every person who we interacted with at High Tide was very attentive and hospitable to us.  Can't wait to come back and try the Cioppino (my favorite) and the Sea Bass. Quality service is a large portion of our dining experience and this place nailed it! Based on our experience with other restaurants in the Gilbert area which are great, this place raised the bar.  You can tell it's a finely tuned establishment and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As a Californian, i used to think that Arizona seafood bar is a bad joke. I mean Arizona is known for the desert a friend of mine tim said give it a try. So I did with sceptaeism, I was surprise the good looks good and good I had the oyster shooter 12 oysters and seafood gumbo it's awesome better then some seafood restaurants know in the bay area"}
{"text":"This was my second time going to this restaurant. I love the smell when you walk in. It's like you're walking into the ocean. It actually has a very nostalgic smell for me since I'm from the Cape Cod area originally. I don't usually love restaurants that are located in Plaza mall areas, but this one is definitely great I'm pretty sure it's not a chain. It has a great menu. If you go there, really you must love seafood. Otherwise, there are options without it but you're doing yourself a disservice. The seafood is great. My fiancé's family always gets the calamari because it doesn't come in rings it comes as steaks. They get calamari everywhere we go and claim that this is the best calamari ever. It is definitely delicious looking. I have to stay away from friend food because it hurts my stomach. I got the salmon the time before and I got the salmon again this time. It's served with creamy risotto and has a side of broccolini. They have a great crabby hour menu. Their version of the happy hour. It has great drink options and appetizer specials. The meals are great. The service was wonderful. Our server was named Sarah and she was very knowledgeable about the menu and a very kind person and a good server. It took us a while to get our food, but we ordered pretty intricate items. Definitely go for the shrimp, they're delicious and huge. Although they are not advertised as jumbo. My fiancé's parents split the pound of crab legs and that looked delicious. My fiancé ordered the deliciously spicy ahi tuna meal and it was. My salmon was blackened and far too salty. I usually like for it to be grilled and crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. I could barely taste the fish it was so salty. Also, the creamy risotto overpowered the rest of the meal. It was too thick and creamy for me. I did not enjoy my meal at all. I'm pretty sure I got the salmon last time I was there and was not so unhappy last time. The ambience is, for the most part, quiet. You can dress casually. There's parking in the outside lot. We went around 5:00 PM and did not need a reservation, however if it's busy on the weekend, and later than that I definitely recommend making one if they'll accept one. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! Hostess, \"Tessa\" was very friendly and kind in greeting us and sat us promptly! Service and food was great all around. 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"Finally found a seafood restaurant in the east valley I can tell my friends in Boston about. The food teeters on the gourmet side but the prices don't reflect it.  Service is good. Menu is not so large that you have difficulty deciding, however, it has a good variety. The oysters were excellent and very fresh. I was pleasantly impressed by the whole experience. Also the decor is simple and classy but not to worry it's not stuffy at all."}
{"text":"My first time here and they really won me over. Their lobster bisque was amazing and I had 'The King' and it was very delicious. I have lots of experience with fresh seafood. Let me just say the king crab had a sweet taste signifying that it was fresh. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for an afternoon date on a Sunday.  We will ABSOLUTELY be going back.  Very seldom am I wowed on a first visit.  The atmosphere was welcoming right from the get go.  Walking in the door you notice the bar and ocean decor.  We were pleasantly greeted and seated right away.  Their happy hour goes from 3-7 7 days a week.  The prices on appetizers and drinks are very reasonable.  They have a nice small selection of micobrews (2 IPA's on tap to my pleasure).  Numerous specialty drinks that did not dissapoint.  On to the food.   We had a crab cake appetizer that exceeded expectations.  It was thick and chocked full of meet.  The flavor of the crab cake by itself was great (I would suggest asking for the Aioli to be completely on the side, as it was a bit strong).  For dinner we had the High Tide Steamer pot.  All I can say is awesome!  Just the right amount of food, everything tasted and smelled super fresh.  The service was impeccable.  Our waiter was attentive and friendly, management came by to make sure everything was good.  I will definitely try sitting at the bar next time, as you can watch the steampots being made right in front of you."}
{"text":"It's pricey but the portions are huge and delicious. Worth every penny.

The spicy seafood pasta (whatever it's called) is probably the best plate of seafood I've ever had."}
{"text":"This was just alright though my husband enjoyed it.  I don't know what I was expecting but the sauce was soooo soupy. I have no idea if that's how it's supposed to be or not but I wasn't a fan so it could be just my preference. It's not a place that I will CRAVE to go again but I'm glad we tried it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and the service.  Have driven by many times.   Went in to celebrate a birthday because my husband wanted shrimp cocktail.  The shrimp were huge.   Everything was awesome."}
{"text":"Food was phenomenal! I am from the eastern sea board and my fiance is from the Great Lakes area so we know good sea food. What a find in Gilbert."}
{"text":"I struggled to give it a five but I enjoyed the staff very much although the service was slow. The oysters on a half shell was not the best I've had because they were not cleaned. I had way too many particles I crunched on. We took our grandkids and the kids menu was normal. They got Mac & cheese and cheeseburger. When we got the plates the cheeseburger looked like an afterthought. The seared scallops meal and the fish and chips were very good. I'll go again but not going to order oysters again."}
{"text":"Highly recommend High Tide. Amazing and fresh dishes, great service, and frequent live music. Will come back again and again."}
{"text":"I'd have taken a photo of our beautiful meal, but forgot everything when the food came out! 

The salmon is divine, prepared perfectly, and my mouth waters as I think about it! 

Service was delightful, everyone taking the time to answer questions. We never felt rushed and welcome to explore the menu and left to enjoy our conversation over dinner. 

We'll definitely be back, and with our salmon-loving friends!"}
{"text":"Gilbert's standards for good food are so lowwwwwwww !!!!
 I ate at this place and had better seafood at Denny's..no kidding!
 
Prices are outrageous! Especially considering the portions...the calamari was some of the worst  I've had...it was served cold!
 If you like oversalted , overcooked, rubbery seafood then this is the place for you!

Try any Mexican seafood joint down the street for half the price and twice the food and great seafood...not this place."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service! You won't be disappointed!
Lobster bisque is to die for. 
And the owner really cares, and it shows. 
I will be a loyal customer for as long as they are here. Gordon Ramsey would be proud!"}
{"text":"Touted as a \"Seafood Bar and Grill.\" The only \"Grilled\" Seafood item is Salmon. WTF? Other  than that singular item, it's Burgers. So, help me out here, exactly where does the \"Grill\" part come into play? Or the \"Seafood\" part?  Only other fish offering is \"Baked Orange Roughy.\"

\"Truth in Advertising\"  I would suggest asking to have the items on the menu match the title, or try someplace else.  And it's kinda pricey."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally made it to High Tide last night. After just returning from two weeks along the southern coastline we were missing the delicious seafood already.  I'm glad I called and made a reservation as we arrived at 5:45 and it was already very busy. 

We were seated promptly at a nice table.  Our waiter was awesome! His name was Justice and he was so knowledgeable and patient. Offering many suggestions as it was our first time. The have some great happy hour items that we were able to order at our table.  We started with clams and calamari as well as wine and beer.  All were very good. My husband ordered the The King steampot and loved it. I had the scallops and they were amazing. Justice was so mindful of getting us to our movie on time but at the same time welcoming us to stay as long as we wanted.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Finally nice to have a great seafood place I. Gilbert. Food was great! Staff was friendly. We ate the the bar where they  make the steam pots specialties it was cool to watch."}
{"text":"This place is awesome . Really nice staff and great food.  We eat here often and have never been disappointed.  Keep doing what you're doing"}
{"text":"We discovered High Tide about 6 or 7 months ago and have eaten there probably 10 times even though we live about 15+ miles away. Easily the best seafood in the east metro area and we have tried many others in Scottsdale, PV,  east Phx. We have heavily sampled the menu and never been disappointed. Generous portions, fresh ingredients, and even their fried chicken (DH's choice last night) is great. Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Arizona Restaurant Week is a valley tradition going on 10 years now.  Originally the Arizona Restaurant Association created the promotion as a way of getting people to try out fine dining restaurants at a discount while the valley was in the early throws of the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression.  The restaurant industry was hit particularly hard and Restaurant Week was a collective attempt by the hospitality industry to try and minimize the damage.  Ten years on, Restaurant Week still happens twice a year, but the discounts are mostly long gone now that the economy has rebounded.  Still, Restaurant Week offers some great opportunities for discovery and to get a good meal at a fairly reasonable price.  Oftentimes at places you'd least expect.

Which brings me to (of all places), Gilbert.  While admittedly I don't get out to Gilbert that often, I've found Gilbert's food scene to be fairly respectable with good personal experiences at local spots like Arizona Wilderness Brewery, Joe's Farm Grill, and Liberty Market just to name a few.  I had High Tide bookmarked for almost a year but of all my bookmarks, it was the furthest from my apartment.  Seeing that High Tide was observing Restaurant Week, it was the push I needed to finally make the drive east.  Located in the Kohl's shopping center on the southwest corner of Val Vista Dr and Williams Field Rd, High Tide is the product of restauranteur Chris Glass and chef Eric Emlet.  The theme here (as best I can tell) is steam kettle cooked seafood with southwestern influences.  The restaurant can seat upwards of 150 or more and also has a large private dining room for private parties.

Coming here by myself, I took the advice of my fellow Yelpers and saddled up to the bar where they're shucking and cooking many of their seafood dishes in steam kettles right in front of you.  During the busy dinner hour its a beehive of activity behind that counter and makes for a good show.  The Restaurant Week menu here offered three courses plus an alcoholic beverage of choice for a prix-fixe price of $44 (prior to tax and tip).  Each course had 2-3 options to choose from this go around.  Decision time.

After choosing a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, I chose to lead off the evening with their Lobster Fondue appetizer.  A super cheesy fondue, small chunks of lobster, cilantro, tequila, lime, and tomatillo.  Its served with fried corn cakes for dipping.  The cakes have the look and texture of fried plantains, though not as sweet.  The fondue was delicious and rich, though I would've liked a little bit more lobster in there (I mean, who wouldn't?).  For my main dish, I went with their Mexican Rose Snapper.  The snapper is steam cooked then stuffed with shrimp and chorizo and sits on a bed of cilantro rice, grilled squash, and doused with a dash of lime and white wine.  Sweet Jesus of Nazareth this was an absolutely amazing dish!  Ermagerd where do I begin with this?  A perfectly flaky fish, some healthy chunks of shrimp, a little spice from the chorizo, and a mix of lime and cilantro flavors down below.  I didn't need to use a knife once as everything cut easily with a fork.  Its honestly nothing short of a perfect dish.  Perfect mix of flavors, textures, and seasonings.  No joke, one of the best dishes I've ever had during Restaurant Week.  Just, wow.  Now then, can we top that with dessert?  I chose a slice of their avocado key lime pie.  Its a key lime pie with avocado mixed in the pie batter as well as avocado slices on top.  This is certainly different, though I was mostly pleased with this invention.  The key lime is still the dominant flavor, but the avocado mellows the tartness and adds a creamier texture than a typical key lime pie.

Including tax and tip, my total bill for the evening came to about $60.  The portions were large, the dishes were brilliantly complex and unique, and the staff were on their A game despite a packed house.  I'll be dreaming about that snapper dish forever and likely make it my dish of choice the next time I'm here as well.  Clearly, High Tide was worth traversing the full length of the valley freeway system to experience.  And I did so thanks in large part to a 10 year valley foodie institution known as Arizona Restaurant Week."}
{"text":"Wow, this was one of my favorite places now. My mom took my husband and I out and we had great service and amazing food.  I ordered the crab cake with salad, hubby ordered the fried chicken,  and mom ordered the short ribs. Every thing was amazing. We also had the Calamari.  Looking for a great seafood place, definitely go here."}
{"text":"We just walked out of High Tide after sitting for close to 10 minutes without receiving service. We after several minute wait, we had waters brought to us, multiple servers walked past us without acknowledging us.  Eventually the manager came and refilled our waters with the menus still sitting on the table but didn't take our order.  After several more minutes we got up and left. It was only after I told the hostess that we were leaving that the manager came running towards us. He tried to explain what \"the process\" is for service there as an explanation why he didn't take our order and instead filled our waters.  Offered us a free appetizer.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! You have to have the chicken wings! Come for happy hour to get great deals! Also the cheesy bread with Crab.... YUM!!! Everyone here is so nice. Sara and Jayson helped us tonight and they made the evening fantastic. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars only because the staff was awesome.. The Food on the other hand was awful. We had calamari as an appetizer, Completely bland.. It's hard to make calamari taste like water, but that is the best way to describe it. My husband had the gumbo, it was okay - but nothing to write home about. I had the salmon, This was the worst part of the dinner. It was SO Salty, It came with risotto and broccoli. I ate a couple of bites, and that was about it.  My daughters mac n cheese and sweet potato fries were good! Total waste of $81!  VERY DISAPPOINTED  :("}
{"text":"I ate here for restaurant week and had pros and cons about the venue. The greeter was pleasant and we seated quickly; they accept reservations. It was a little busy, but I think our waiter was a little flustered. Service was not the best I have received, although our waiter said that there was some computer \"technical\" difficulties. The appetizers were delicious! We had the calamari and crab cake. The entrées were of a mixed review. My mother got the salmon with risotto, which was delicious. I had the spicy seafood pasta. It was quite spicy, which was okay. However, the mixed seafoods were average. The shrimp, scallops and squid were tasty but I thought the mussels and clams had an odd taste. The desserts were pretty good. Overall, I thought it was a decent evening dinner; I would consider coming back and trying the fish and chips or salmon if I get the chance to go back."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant each visit has been so consistant and never disappoints.  I am from So Florida and miss good seafood...the seafood here is always so fresh and the portions are good size.  We find it very reasonable and enjoy sitting at the bar watching the chefs prepare the steam pots.  Good service good food and good atmosphere! One of our favorites : )"}
{"text":"Good food..not so good service tonight. Took about 10 minutes to get drinks and then another 10 minutes after that to get orders taken. Spent the rest of the night with either an empty glass or asking another staff person for a refill, salt and pepper, ketchup,  etc. Appetizer came out followed by the entrées just a few moments later.

As for the food - pretty good, a tad on the pricey side but not outrageous. The gumbo was flavorful as was the clam chowder. The table next to us got the fried chicken which looked gargantuan and really good.

Good atmosphere, seemingly good food, an off night for service."}
{"text":"The food is excellent.  The bartender Debra makes your visit fantastic!  Steam pot dishes are exceptional, as well as the Gumbo.  We go once a week for lunch and have never had a bad experience. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"3.5. This place has good imported seafood. Im frm the west coast, so spoiled w/fresh & the best. Big \"BUT\" CONCERN is the steam pots, (sat at the bar)  & husband is allergic to shrimp, and we noted they NEVER cleaned pots between orders, ........ !!!!??? Also i dont like pork on Rockefeller. GORGEOUS decor,  awhhh felt like home in AZ"}
{"text":"Service was slow, food was gross. After all the high reviews I don't know if we just had bad luck or what, but nothing was good about this place. 

Went for an early dinner on a Thursday. Around 5. There were only 2-3 couples in the place eating. We ordered drinks and calamari. The calamari should have a disclaimer that it isn't like what you expect. They were giant fish stick like pieces of what I would guess was squid but it tasted and chewed like rubber. It was barely edible. We order the king pot and gumbo. gumbo tasted like canned tomato soup with a few tiny shrimp and some sausage in it. It was the worst I've had. Wife's crab was good, but the rest of her dish had a funky taste. Took it home to try not to be rude since she barely touched it and dumped it in the trash. We both barely touched our food and were ready to go. Waiting brought out check and we still didn't have the drinks we ordered. We pointed this out since they were on the bill and we never got them. Instead of offering to take them off she just walks off and 10 minutes later brings us our drinks when our food is already boxed up to go. We each took a sip and then left. 

Would not return and of all the places in Arizona we have ate since moving here, this has been the worst experience."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Gilbert, High Tide is a great eatery with space ,rustic factory atmosphere, and great food. Service is second to none and food is amazing."}
{"text":"Have dined here 3 times so far,calamari,lobster mac and cheese fabulous!At times service can be slow,but courteous always.Becoming my go to spot for a good seafood meal"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant based on recommendation by Marriott in Chandler. Turned out to be better than I had hoped. In a small strip mall area, they serve very, very good seafood. Started with yellow beet and baby spinach salad - I had the half portion as I was saving room for the main course. That would be tuna done medium rare - and it was perfectly cooked, not an easy thing to do when you consider how many dishes they prepare and the possible wait time between when the chef prepares and the waitress picks up. Not sure what that red sauce was that you mix with the soy, but it will get your attention, and it does compliment the tuna. Wines by the glass were good selections, and (any) New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc will pair well with fish. 

My waitress was Felicia and she was  attentive and prompt and even helped with the outdoor heater when needed.

Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I  can not believe how good and fresh this place is. first time there i had the clam chowder and fish n chips with pistachio/sea salt carmel gelato for dessert     it was amazing!!! best i have ever had   today i went for second time and had the louisiana gumbo steam pot    can not believe how good it was  every bite got better and better- if that is even possible. i plan on eating my way thru the menu with each visit. i love that they have lunch size portions on their entrees   ( i wonder if they would consider half orders?)"}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my steam pot and was pleased they would remove crawfish and add extra shrimp for me. The glass pear was a mild yet tasty accompaniment. Service was good. Ambiance was quiet, perfect for a late lunch after a long day."}
{"text":"Have been back a few times since. Love the cioppino. All 3 times I just had to reorder it because it is so good. Unfortunately the last time I was there and ordered it I got violently ill an hour later. Now I am reluctant to return."}
{"text":"The food was delicious - the service was awful.  I arrived party of one and the hostess said 'Go sit at the bar' I asked if I needed a menu and she said 'I will bring one' for over 20 minutes no menu, no server.  I ordered my food and no one ever checked back.  By far the worst service I have had in years - I won't be back."}
{"text":"First time here and it did not disappoint!   I had the mussels and my husband had a steam pot.  Both were delicious!   Customer service was excellent!   Very personable and attentive staff."}
{"text":"This place was great! we went specifically for lobster mac and cheese and it was pretty good, not the best one I've had but really good. We also tried the crab dip and it was amazing!! really good drinks also!"}
{"text":"This is a terrific place for fresh seafood. They are very accommodating and will split a plate for you if requested. My wife an I order Halibut fish and chips in panko breading and share it. Nice flakey halibut with some tartar sauce. Super good."}
{"text":"I am so glad that I read the reviews and chose this place.  Our server, David, was excellent!  We ordered the gumbo and the special, which was the pan seared sea bass with an asparagus sauce....it was fantastic!  The fish was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were delish!  We also had the bread pudding, which David recommended, and it was very good.  (we were glad it did not have the customary raisins in it)  The gumbo with the dirty rice was very tasty. (tip: ask for an extra scoop of rice if you like your gumbo over rice)  We highly recommend this establishment and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was so excited to dine here asked friends and they loved it.  Well friends here is my review....   wait was to be 30 minutes and it was an hour.  Ok. Had a couple wines while I waited.  Then it was dinner time.  Jennifer was at our table pronto filling our drinks and getting things rolling.   Service from Jennifer was exceptional.  Started with ceviche ... excellent.      Dinners were not prepared correctly.  My husbands meal looked great but some clams were not opened.    Does that mean they were not steamed properly or bad ????
Our guest ordered no sweet potato fries. And guess what.  He got them.  Who expedited the kitchen orders????
And the manager is doing what?   Roams around, looks at you but can't ask you how things are?    I like interaction 

My opinion is absent owner and who ever they are needs to get on board.  
I will not return."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, wide menu selection from seafood to burgers, soup & salad, steak, chicken... Sevice is fantastic too! 
Reasonable prices too. We will be back and bringing friends!"}
{"text":"Lobster mac and lobster bisque along with the ciopino absolutly to die for big portions fresh food I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"We order take out from this place at least once a month. I just called to make an order and they told me they don't take togo orders on Friday and Saturday. So what because we don't have the time to come in and sit down to order we're not worth it? They have definitely lost our business."}
{"text":"There is hope for Hide Tide but they aren't there yet. I was disappointed to find that they have been open for 2 years because I thought the issues we encountered were from growing pains. The ambience is typical shopping mall. I have a hard time reconciling the upscale menu with the casual atmosphere of the restaurant. The hostess needs training. She tends to yell across the restaurant. The busboy could hardly see out from under all his hair. He cleared a table close to ours and dropped calamari off the plates on his way by. Our waiter was eager to please but obviously inexperienced. He had to come back twice to ask about our order. We weren't offered bread and the water was slow to arrive. You get your food from many different people. They lady who brought our salads forgot to put dressing on them. The greens were not properly drained so there was a puddle of water at the bottom of the bowl, a pet peeve of mine. We left our forks in the salad bowls and had to ask for another one when our main course was delivered. The special Valentine's Day dinner consisted of a lobster tail, petite filet, grilled asparagus and a mound of mashed potatoes. There was a salty brown sauce on the filet and a white sauce for the lobster. The steak was very tender an cooked just right. The lobster was hard to get out of the shell. There was a spinach gratin on top but I lost most of mine when I turned it over to get the meat out. The asparagus was good just a little under done.  The potatoes were full of chives and tasted very good.
By the time we were finished with our meal we were both out of water. When our desserts were delivered we asked for more water which never came. Our server was pretty slow in checking on us so we had to wait for quite a while before we could order coffee. We were not offered a second cup. The server asked to take our plates but I had left most of my filet and asked for a box. The plates sat there through our dessert. 
We were given a glass of champagne between the main course and dessert which I thought was a very nice touch. Overall, the special menu dinner was a good deal.
There seemed to be a lot of staff which should have made for outstanding service but that was not the case. I hope things improve because it is nice to have a good seafood restaurant in the east valley."}
{"text":"Have been to this place a few times. Enjoyed each time until the most recent. I tried reaching out to the owners before this post but they wouldn't call me back. I went on a Sunday almost 2 weeks ago with my daughter. We arrived at 530 and a friend met us there. Due to the time of day there were many people coming in after us for dinner. We were sat at the first table at the front window so we had a view of the entire restaurant with the exception of the first row of booths as soon as you walk in. We were there til almost 7pm and during our stay I noticed a manager walking around personally greeting each table and making sure everyone was happy. For 90 minutes I watched this man greet every table in the restaurant,  except of course,  ours. And we were smack dab in the middle of the entire restaurant! He walked by us at least 15 times and never even made eye contact. It may not seem like a big deal to some but my daughter is mixed and my friend is black. I have never had someone so blatantly avoid us for what had to be this reason. Either that or he just thought we were ugly. I called the restaurant and left my number and asked for an owner to call me back due to an \"experience I had in their restaurant \" I did get a call back the next day from the gm,(the guy I want to complain about) and nicely told him I want an owner to call me back. Unfortunately, no owner has called me back so I have to let them know publicly that they need to be aware of the restaurants gm's behavior. Has anyone else had an issue like this? I haven't ever posted a complaint online but attention needs to be brought to this type of behavior. Our server was amazing and most of the food is great, but due to their selection of GM, we will never return."}
{"text":"I ordered One dozen of the Bluepoint oysters on the half shell, recommended Waitress. Thinking this is a seafood restaurant, the oysters should be fresh but half of the oyster were dead."}
{"text":"Very popular, upscale and somewhat pricey seafood joint that was very honestly mediocre.  Yes, I grew up on the east coast (literally the ocean - I lived in a beach house on Long Island for 4 years) so I have had amazing seafood and this was genuinely far from it. 

I had the lobster bisque for starters because there were so many overwhelming reviews here in Yelp as to how amazing it is. Well, just as I expected, Arizonans unfortunately do NOT know amazing seafood (yet!) and the bisque was decent in flavor (not great) and definitely a little too heavy (too much cream).  If you really want the best lobster bisque in Phoenix go to The Kings Fish House in the Tempe Marketplace. Compare and you will notice a BIG difference. 

For my entree, I went with the Gumbo hot bowl.  I ordered it with oysters added in at their suggestion.  Unfortunately, I received my bowl of bisque and the Gumbo at the same time however besides that there were NO oysters in my Gumbo - which we waited about 45 minutes for.  

Now listen here folks... Perhaps this was a bad night but this was literally the worst gumbo I have ever had.  It was the right thickness and texture and it even had a nice smokiness to it however, there was almost no flavor. I even had my party of six taste it and everyone said it was tasteless.  Sooooo... If you like Gumbo or creole food, go to the Ocean Trail restaurant at the Talking Stick resort. Best gumbo and creole food in Phoenix!  Yes, way better than Pappadeaux!  Trust me. 

P.S. My cousin ordered the Cioppino hot bowl and while that was much better, tastier (yes, I did sample some) it also was not anywhere near the best I have had.  My cousin and another guest who ordered the Ciopino said the same. 

In sum... Yes, this place is amongst the best we have in Phoenix for seafood however, in comparison to honestly what is out there... It's nothing to write home about. Kings Fish House is genuinely much better."}
{"text":"Stop whatever you're doing and read this review right now! This place is fantastic! I'm not going to lie, I was a little skeptical at first, but I very quickly changed my tune! 

We started with an appetizer that everyone on Yelp seemed to talk about, the lobster Mac and cheese... It was really really good! For our main courses we ordered the \"tide roast\" and the \"spicy seafood pasta\". Both were nothing short of wonderful! (Side note: when I ordered the spicy pasta, our fantastic waitress asked if I'd like to taste the base sauce so they could either spice it up or take it down a notch. Very much appreciated by the way)

For dessert we got the bread pudding (also raved about on Yelp). Definitely lived up to the hype!

Also, portions were huge, so we definitely took home some leftovers of everything.

I will DEFINITELY be back. High Tide Seafood Bar & Grill is just where you want to go! I'll also be sharing with all of my friends how good the food is and how awesome the service is!"}
{"text":"Awesome service at High Tide. Bloody Mary Bar is awesome on Sunday too. Had a crab cake which was solid crab meat and very fresh. Also tried the Seafood Gumbo which was very good too. My first time at High Tide and was a very good experience. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars due to the excellent food! Maybe it was an off night, but the wait staff barely talked to us. Once seated, it took 10 
Minutes for someone to show up with water and take our order. It was just under an hour later that our food came out. Well worth the wait, but the joy was short lived since we had to keep flagging down the waiters for refills and etc.
I will give this place another try, to be fair. I hope they retrain their staff and put a little excitement into the place."}
{"text":"Craving some pan roast after having just been in Vegas and visited the famous Oyster Bar in Palace Station Hotel, I found this restaurant on Yelp. While the pan roast is not the same as Palace Station, it is still good. Great - ehhhh, that may be pushing it.  Seafood was fresh, but broth was a little too fishy for my taste and had a soupy consistency.  I kinda felt like I was eating lobster bisque.  But hey, I finished the whole damn thing. 

Seafood was fresh.  I wish I could have controlled the heat level because it wasn't spicy enough for me - I like my pan roast on the spicy side - Level 7 to 8.  I requested my tide roast spicy, but whether or not the chef adjusted the heat level is unknown to me...because the server did give me dirty rice when I asked for white...so maybe she just didn't tell him. I will never know. Next time, I will just repeat myself.

I added oysters to the tide roast which were good. I don't know if I would do it again - they seemed kinda out of place in the dish, but the oysters themselves were fresh. I really wanted to try the lobster mac but that will have to wait for next time."}
{"text":"Anniversary dinner and could not of been more pleased.  Bucket of steamed clams YUM. Salmon dinner YUM, Jambalaya, my husband said YUM, lobster bisque YUM.
What more can I say? loved the atmosphere and service was spot on.  Next time I want to try the lobster mac n cheese and fish n chips."}
{"text":"I was impressed the minute I walked into the door when they took my number and said they'd text me when my table was ready. I had never been to a place that did that and I thought it was very cool. 

The atmosphere feels casual and fun yet swanky. I loved the beachy decor. Next time I come I plan to sit up at the bar which looked very fun. Coke products are served as well as several very delicious fruity drinks and some nice draft beer and wine selections. The San-dollar was quite good. 

There are definitely a lot of great, interesting choices to read through! I couldn't decide! 
We started with calamari (very tender) and side Cesar salad. I thought I ordered a small side salad, but my goodness it was huge and delicious and very filling! I went with the Spicy Seafood Pasta which was packed with yummy cod, shrimp, clams, mussels, and so much fishy goodness!

We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Fabulous service! All of the staff was very friendly from the time we walked in the door until we left. Food was fantastic! The Lobster Mac & Cheese was heavenly and the Oyster Bloody Mary was delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Was quoted an hour and we waited an hour and a half to be seated. After being seated, we waited an hour until we got our food. My hungry tummy was not happy. Our server was absolutely amazing though!"}
{"text":"I used to work at High Tide and sadly had to leave because I was moving back to NM. Ever since I left I cannot eat seafood without wishing I was eating High Tide!!! :(( I seriously wanna go back just to eat the AMAZING FRESH food!! Great place, great staff, and Amazing food!! I truly miss working there!!! (and eating) :))"}
{"text":"This place is a great place to eat and gather with friends and family  the food is great and served hot never had to ask for anything there was a waiter at the table always and they were very friendly and we even got a visit from the manager"}
{"text":"The best seafood & southern foods ever! I ordered High Tide seafood combo & Louisiana gumbo; it was to die for! Yummy"}
{"text":"Where to begin...I don't even think it is worth one star!!! I have been to High Tide twice and will NEVER go back again. The first time was back in May. We called to make a reservation for a birthday dinner. We were five minutes late for the reservations and ended up waiting for over an hour for our table. I get that we were late, but seriously? I ordered a glass of malbec. I may be wine snob, but I didn't think red wine should be cold. The waitress said that they have a special red wine cooler and that people have complained about the wine being cold. Anyway, the food was very good and so I just decided that the next time I would just order something else. 

I went yesterday with my mom for a quick lunch. A big party of about 10 people were in front of us and the hostess seemed to have been very overwhelmed. I asked if she had anything available for two and she said only in the bar area. So my mom and I walked around to the side of the hostess stand only to be yelled at that we can't see ourselves and that she will take us over in a minute. We were only moving out of the way of the ten people that were walking in the door. The hostess was very unprofessional. She kept saying how they had three big parties coming in (hence all the empty tables in the restaurant part apparently). We were then seated a very tiny two top in the bar which was ridiculous seeing that there were several open four tops available. Again, the hostess was annoyed but seated us at a different table. 

The waitress/bartender for the bar area finally made her way over after taking care of everyone at the bar. We ordered waters which took about 10 minutes to come so we ordered our lunch which consisted of a caesar salad, two bowls of lobster bisque and an order of rolls. I also let the waitress know that she can just bring everything out together. However, what I didn't realize was that it would take over 30 minutes. Finally I got up, walked over the bar and asked her how long it would be and she said she would bring it over. After another five minutes, I saw that she walked around the bar, put the soup in the bowls, grabbed a few rolls and brought it over to the table. I asked her politely to cancel the salad and she was in shock. I said that we had to leave soon and that we didn't realize it would take so long for the soup to come out. Her response was that she is only the \"bartender\" and only responsible for drinks. I told her I saw her put the soup in the bowls and she was nasty and denied it. I couldn't believe how rude she was. We got up and walked out. 

It's very disappointing as the food is very good, however, the staff is very rude and unprofessional. I will never step foot in this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Arizona.....ironic since I am from the Northwest where there is an abundance of amazing seafood. I go there frequently and have never had a bad meal.   I am so happy to have found this place!"}
{"text":"Best seafood in the Valley unless you want fried.................Really it doesn't get any better than this unless you want a crab shack............"}
{"text":"We went there for happy hour twice last week.  Both times, the food was delicious.  The restaurant is clean, staff is very friendly!  The tide roast is so creamy!  Happy hour prices are great!  We will definitely be returning here regularly."}
{"text":"The best dinning experience food is fantastic loved it everytime we have been there. Would recomend this restaurant too all that love seafood."}
{"text":"This restaurant is far more expensive than $$ and it's just bad food. 

The first time we went we embraced the hot steam pot menu as something new to try. It was gross. Sorry but there really isn't much more to add. 

Six months later we went back as the reviews are great, it's a local place, and we all know mistakes happen. I had the scallops and my wife had the sea bass. Both proteins were good and the asparagus was fine. However the risotto and orzo sides were foul.

It's just not worth it. Maybe it's their addiction to cream and saffron? Whatever it is we won't be going back."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey-side, but worth it. Tasty food, well presented. Friendly staff. Prompt service. Good craft beer selection (try the Lefthand Milk Stout).

Pro-tip: This place is popular, and can get busy. If you don't have a reservation, expect to wait 30 minutes or more."}
{"text":"Great Service and Great Food - Easily the best Seafood place in the East Valley if not all of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I have been 4 times now and cannot get enough. The seafood gumbo is fantastic and loaded with seafood. The fish and chips are fantastic and happy hour is one of the best around. My kids love the mac n cheese and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"High Tide is a fantastic find.  A real surprise in the East Valley.
Everything is obviously very fresh from start to finish.  Our cocktails were not made with mixes.  We had calamari for an appetizer and it was among the best I ever ate.  For entrees, I had the gumbo and my husband had some seafood thing with pasta in a cream sauce.  He LOVED it.  The gumbo was good and very meaty, but it really needed some spice.  The portions on the entrees were large enough for both of us to have a second meal with the leftovers.
Our server was knowledgeable but there were a couple of shortfalls in service, especially with regard to the bar.  This may not have been her fault but could be a heads up for the manager for improvement."}
{"text":"This is as our first visit here and we ca not wait until we return. We had the calamari to start off with and it was delicious! For our entrees, I had the scallops and my wife had the halibut. We shared both dishes and they were thoroughly delightful! Do not pass up on the Key Lime pie for dessert!"}
{"text":"Had reservations for Mothers Day, and on arrival were seated immediately! Needless to say the restaurant was packed, but we were greeted by our server as soon as we were seated! The server could not have been more efficient, and helpful! The Lobster Bisque was excellent, as was the Lobster Mac N Cheese! My dish, called the \"The King\" was as good as it gets! Great Saffron Cream sauce, served over pasta, with some great seafood! The Crab Cakes was as equally as good! looking forward to the next visit!"}
{"text":"We've come here a couple times. I like the variety of seafood options although I don't actually eat seafood. Haha. I go for the husband. He's had mussels, oysters, king crab, etc. I like how clean this restaurant is. It can get pretty busy so reservations seem best. They do have a happy hour with some discounted appetizers. The portions for the appetizers are a wee bit small."}
{"text":"I was excited to see so many great reviews to this place because I drive by it a lot and was eager to try it. Like other reviewers, I found the options very limited and I wasn't sure were 'steam pots' were and nobody ever explained them. Anyway, we ordered some very over priced pasta, the 'king', which had a handful of shrimp and fish and ONE crab leg. Also, I ordered a salad and calamari for starters and they came out AFTER the pasta. Ok...thanks for bringing out my salad  and appetizer after the main course!? Speaking of which, the caesar salads I buy in ready to make bags are better than this one and the calamari was 'meh'... I've had muuuch better. All in all it was a 2 star experience and I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now, and both experiences were great. I love seafood and this place has everything I could want. The cocktails are good too. Both my visits were during dinner rush but the service was always great. Pictured are the beer steamed clams and calamari, both of which I'd recommend! For the main course I'd recommend one of the hot pots. 

If you love seafood you've got to try this place!"}
{"text":"We went for a lunch on Valentine's Day.  No lunch menu that day.
I had the Cioppino which was full, full of a variety of seafood in a tomatoe broth. Husband had the salmon plate and both were tasty.
We would certainly go back again for lunch or happy hour. 

Our only complaint was the waiter totally ignored us when we wanted refills of our drinks. Never glanced our way or came to the table.

We were very happy with the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Excellent food, large booths and high end service. The location is good but I didn't expect my experience to be as good from the outside. Once I went in, I could tell it's a gem!"}
{"text":"Main dishes were excellent, but skip the sides - Caesar salad/cole slaw/bread.  Not worth the money and very boring.  We had (5) different entrees and they were all delicious."}
{"text":"I really loved this place. Nice welcome, good calamari and happy hour specials. I ordered the spicy seafood pasta and it was delicious! Enough for two meals. Fresh warm bread, too. My hubby was not as thrilled with his scallops. I tasted and thought they were good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a great little gem with a nice happy hour.  Food is awesome and there is a great kids menu!"}
{"text":"From our wonderful server Summer to the amazing dinner we had I would give this restaurant a 10+ stars if I could! If you live in AZ you must take a trip out to Gilbert for this gem! We had Lobster Bisque, Oysters Rockefeller, one of their Steam Pot Specialties, and Lobster Mac n Cheese! All of them were out of this world! Portion size was perfect and not a shortage of Lobster anywhere!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday evening.  Wasn't too busy.  Plenty of seating.  My husband and I were looking forward to a nice meal since it was his birthday.  Waitress took us to a four top table and I ask if we could sit in one of the booths that were open.   Note there were at least three four top booths available.  The hostess stopped looked me in the eye and simple said \"no\"...I waited for an explanation but none was forthcoming.... I finally said \"I don't like that answer\"  then she finally gave the explanation they were reserved..  I had called before we got there and they had plenty of room so we didn't need reservations.  So I felt she was lying.  But I didn't want to leave since my husband was the one who had suggested eating there and I have worked in the food industry and I know what happens to food for customers who are a pain...so we sat at the table had a fairly nice meal of fish n chips and the beet salad.   Both were wonderful.  This would have been rated at least four stars if the seating experience hadn't been such a negative experience...management should train better...what happened to pleasing the customer? Also note that at least one of the \"reserved\"booths was still open when we left...even with this experience we will probably try it again."}
{"text":"Great place!  Very friendly staff, great timing, amazing food...and the bread pudding is out of this world DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Overpriced cheap quality seafood. The steamed mussels were floating in a ton of broth with chopped tomatoes and onions??? They weren't cleaned properly and debeard. All the mussels that I have eaten are usually in a delicious flavorful wine reduction and not floating in broth that looks like soup rather than a properly cooked bowl of steamed mussels. The clam chowder tasted like it came out of a can. The tide roast and the king had the same taste of overly buttered heavy cream sauce with no authentic flavor. The shrimp, crab legs, salmon and shrimp in both of those dishes did not taste fresh at all. They tasted like cheap quality seafood that have been frozen for awhile, left out for hours to thaw and then were served to customers. Our lunch came out to almost $90. At that price I would expect much higher quality seafood. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best seafood in Phoenix! My boyfriend had the Tide Roast and I had the lobster mac with garlic broccolini. We loved both of our meals. We were impressed with the quality of food and the professionalism of the staff! The manager came by to check on every table as well!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and horrible service. Not worth the price of admission if you catch my drift."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much on the outside, but it is very nice on the inside. Very great place got a nice date. The food was really good as well and the staff were all very friendly! The food was on the more pricey side though. They take reservations, which you may want to do, since they were very busy even on a Wednesday :)"}
{"text":"We started with the most delicious fresh oysters - sauces were excellent. Then we both had the Cioppono steam pot. Wow - fantastic! Shrimp, mussels, clams, Calamari, fish - all in an incredibly tasty broth. Dip the fresh bread in for extra tastiness!  Seasonal pumpkin desert was out of this world. The staff was amazing - the owner and manager heard it was our first time and spent a couple minutes chatting with us. Service was first rate. High Tides will definitely be on our \"best of\" list!  5 star all the way!"}
{"text":"Lobster Mac N' Cheese TO DIE FOR !! Also the Clam Chowder Soup was killer. I went here with my girlfriend on our anniversary and we wanted to try something new. Well, we had an amazing time the service was nice and respectful. The environment give you that beach relaxed vibe! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food, super friendly owners and staff. Crab cakes are to DIE FOR! Love the decor. They have happy hour on Sunday's. I cannot find a thing bad to say. 

My husband and I came here for our anniversary dinner. Brought our 5 month old too. The staff was super welcoming as soon as they opened the door for us. Food was quick and delicious! Staff was very friendly and attentive. Desert was so yummy and I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Just back from Overseas Deployment, had to come by and have some awesome food with awesome people! The staff has not wavered at all! Wonderful people taking care of us! Sorry we missed you Zach! of course the food was spectacular just as it always is! Bravo Chef! Thank you for everything High Tide!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying I'm not a big fan of seafood. But given that it is restaurant week, I threw caution to the wind when a friend suggested we try it. The bar area was cool but we decided to sit at a booth. The ahi poke was absolutely delicious and I'm already craving it again. I took our waiter's suggestion and had the salmon for my entree. Again, it was incredible...melt in your mouth fantastic. For dessert, I had the chocolate gelato which topped off an amazing dining experience. I live in north Scottsdale but would be willing to make the drive to try this place again. I don't see how you could be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Seared ahi is spicy! I got ciapino and asked to make it spicy and they certainly did. They had my favorite beer on tap!"}
{"text":"Amazing seafood. WOW! I highly recommend the tide roast. And the lobster bisque is very good. I can't believe this place is in the Valley. We drive all the way from Scottsdale and its worth it."}
{"text":"Great food all around, and the atmosphere is fun and inviting.  We had the special, Walleye, Gumbo, Fish n Chips, and Fried Chicken and it was all fantastic.  The calimari was great too!  I'm not a huge sea food fan, but I still really liked the menu and we all had a great time. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Every time I've ever been here the customer service is amazing and the food is incredible, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a lucky choice for Friday night dinner! Trying to avoid meat on Fridays during Lent,
we headed here after a recommendation from a friend. I ordered the halibut special, and hubs got Tide Roast with dirty rice. Wow, wow and wow. Lemon risotto = plate-licking good. Grilled asparagus = perfectly crisp and smoky. Citrus beurre blanc sauce = subtle and delicate and... heaven. Halibut = slightly overcooked (easily made up for by risotto and beurre blanc).
Hubs reports his entree was \"very, very good,\" but I didn't taste it because I was too busy savoring EVERY molecule on my plate.

We did have to ask for the sourdough that comes with steam pots (Tide Roast), but when it finally showed up, it was fresh and warm and chewy and sour and wonderful.

I thoroughly enjoyed an icy Mudshark white ale with my meal, but the Santan Devils Ale gave DH a splitting headache, strangely... so odd.

Wrapped things up with the bread pudding, served hot with vanilla ice cream and a very light drizzle of caramel sauce. I adored it, but DH wanted more caramel sauce.

Please keep in mind, we are splitting hairs here and being ultra critical of some seriously delicious food. 
Sadly, it's so hard to come by a decent sauce these days, and High Tide nailed it. Their chef is not playing around.

Server Matthew took excellent care of us and made us feel like the most important couple in the restaurant.

All in all, if I had died on my way home after this meal, I would have had zero regrets."}
{"text":"The wife and I found this place when she was up for seafood. Close to home, nice clean atmosphere, friendly staff. The food was excellent and the service was well timed. Great place!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fried chicken! It was really good and the added honey was inventive to me. I would have never paired the two. My husbands dish came with french fries, which were perfect. 
The manager or owner came by and asked us how we were doing. It actually felt sincere and not an \"I'm just doing this because I'm suppose to\" type thing, and she didn't linger. 
I appreciated the atmosphere and enjoyed being there. I just wish it was cheaper! It seems a little over priced, but it is good quality."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy happy hour.... that's always a plus in my book
Very clean and staff are great..
I am gonna have to try it for dinner and update my post."}
{"text":"Very nice and clean store. Crab cake was excellent as was the jumbo shrimp cocktail.  I had the fried chicken and it was great. The garlic beans were delicious. My wife had the fish and chips and she really liked them. The kids had the cheeseburgers and they thought they were excellent. We arrived there at 4 on a Saturday and we found lots or room in the place. By 530 it was packed. I can see why, we really enjoyed our visit. All the staff were friendly and the managers/owners came by several times to check in.  It was a nice experience and the price for what you received was right on."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been here several times and have always enjoyed my meal. I like that although it's billed as a seafood place, their other offers are also top notch! I have had great luck with their service too. The owners are generally there and really care that you have a good experience. I like that they have different events throughout the year and have seasonal drink menus. It's just so nice to have something of this quality in the SE Valley! Oh! I also like that you can go here in a T-shirt or a coat and tie -it's a comfortable place for all! Two tips - try their wings. They are not the typical wing in taste or appearance - but awesome! Second - make a reservation!"}
{"text":"This place is \"OFF THE HOOK\" ....Seafood humor...lol. But seriously, High tide is a terrific place. 5 stars! I think this place rocks! the steam-pot cooking approach is very unique, the staff and service was very friendly and attentive, and the food was de-lish! all of the seafood is very fresh and well prepared.... and even though it is a seafood restaurant, the best thing on the menu might be the southern-fried chicken! no kidding! I had the kale salad...it is very hearty already, with greens, squash, pancetta, and pumpkin seeds... But I had them add seared Ahi with a chili spice rub.....it is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I'm leaving 4 stars because everything else, besides the chowder, was outstanding.  I've been here to dine several times and always rave about the New England style clam chowder.  I was very disappointed to find out they changed the chowder.  It is no longer New England style.  It was more Potato soup with one clam on top.  It was a yellow-beige color, not white and creamy as it was before.  Did they change the recipe?  Need to change it back, I won't be ordering that again or recommending it to anyone.  The mussels were good and the crab cake."}
{"text":"Just had New Years Eve dinner and it was fantastic. Had been here before for lunch which was also great. Service is equal to the food.  It was very busy but you would never know it from our servers calm and professional demeanor. The calamari was unique and the best I ever had. Entrees equally great. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the 4th time I've been here. I've loved the food and have been raving about it to coworkers and friends. Sadly after tonight I will not be back. I ordered the crab cheesy bread, I didn't care for it. I told the waitress I didn't like it and could I switch it out for something else so I got the lobster Mac and cheese. When I got the bill the crab bread was still on it. I mentioned it to the waitress and she said she would get the manager. He comes over and rudely asks \"what's wrong with it?\" I said I'm sorry I just didn't like it. He said \"That's the only thing that's wrong with it?? That you just didn't like it. Usually when you order something you pay for it, even if you didn't like it but whatever I guess I'll take it off\" he was very aggressive about it. The waitress brought the new bill and I asked her if she could ask him to come back. I could see him from where I was and I saw him roll his eyes and shake his head when she asked him to come back. He comes back and again rudely asks \"do you have another problem?\" I said I don't appreciate how aggressive and rude you're being with me. I may be the only person in history to not like crab cheesy bread but you don't treat customers that way. He says \"in every restaurant I've ever managed if the customer doesn't like something unless it's burnt or overcooked they pay for it regardless. I took it off your bill because I didn't want to argue with you.\" I asked him why he was getting so aggressive with me and he said \"I've never heard that before\" He apologized if I thought he was getting aggressive. So if you go here don't ever tell them you don't like something. I guess all our taste buds are the same. Really disappointed I've never been treated so poorly by a manager."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try High Tide after reading lots of reviews here and hearing a general buzz in the community.  Upon arrival, when getting out of our cars in the parking lot, we immediately smelled the seafood smell.  Now, I am not bothered by that.  I grew up in a fishing village on the east coast and am used to the smell but I can understand how someone not used to it might be a little nervous.  

Upon entering, we immediately noticed how nice the restaurant was.  Very nicely done; color scheme was pretty and felt nautical, finishings were high end and tasteful.  We found it very comfortable.  We asked to sit closer to the bar at a table on that side as that is where is seems like more of the action is happening.  The bar is very large and the boil pots are there manned with a chef for some of the dishes.

We decided to try a few different appetizers instead of entrees.  An added bonus was that we found out they had just started a happy hour deal that included most (excluding a few exceptions) of the appetizers at the rate of half off.  What a deal!!  I had a cup of lobster bisque which was some of the best I have ever had.  There were bits of lobster in almost every bite.   It wasn't too heavy like a lot of bisque's tend to be.  It was pretty much perfection.  We also tried to cajun shrimp boil, crab cake and lobster mac and cheese.  All dishes were quite large and very ample.  The shrimp boil was chock full of shrimp.  There was no skimping here.  All the food was very good, although I thought that the lobster mac and cheese was a tad bit bland and could have used a little more flavor.  It would definitely not stop me from trying it again, however.  

Service was ok; our food, which was just appetizers, took about 40 minutes which I thought was long.  Yes, it was our meal but what if it wasn't?  40 minutes for appetizers would mean a 2 hour dinner if we had entrees. I'm not sure if this is standard timing and I would tend to think not.  It will not stop me from coming back, that is for sure.  We really enjoyed ourselves at High Tide and can't wait to come back with friends and family."}
{"text":"My husband I went there for our anniversary and it was the first time we'd been there. Our food was AMAZING! I order the sea scallops and he got the fish and chips. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"loved.  recently stopped in on whim for a little dinner date with my mom.  we made it in time for happy hour... so we stuck with half priced appetizers.  it was nice to hear that they do happy hour seven days a week & reverse happy hour on friday and saturday.

we started with the fire lake oysters.  so clean & fresh, slightly sweet.  i'm a big fan of oysters and these were some of the best.  we also tried the steam black mussels... which i love.  the flavor was on point & we were able to soak up the broth with the fresh sour dough bread.  it was glorious.  we ordered a crab cake to split... some places really try to skimp you on crab meat but this one was perfection.  it was served with a fried avocado & micro green salad... and that aoili though... awesome.

ended the night with the bread pudding.  ...the most amazing end of the meal.  get the bread pudding!

unfortunately, we didn't get around to entrees.  i was stuffed.  but i will definitely be frequenting this place!  i am so happy to have somewhere close to home with quality seafood.    

the service was on point... a little slower toward the end but the restaurant started getting super busy around six.  still, everyone was so friendly.  the decor is great.  it feels like you're next to some beach, some where... not in the outskirts of gilbert.  the bar is awesome... i heard a nice little rumor that they have a bloody mary bar on sunday mornings with a bacon wrapped shrimp.  i can't wait to try it out."}
{"text":"The crab cake and spinach salad is excellent.. I would definitely recommend this place.."}
{"text":"This seafood joint is AMAZING. Growing up in California you know what good seafood is and High Tide is right up there. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves good seafood. The service is always a delight."}
{"text":"Yelp reviews and really the star averages, by and large, are very accurate.  Not in this case.  Going in, we realize we live in the east valley so any seafood is flown in and not typically going to be as good as if you lived by the water on a coast.  So six of us ordered a variety so we didn't put too much pressure on the seafood aspect of their menu alone.  The fried chicken, okra, mac and cheese, steamed clams, fish and chips (anything fried is usually pretty good), cioppino, and drinks.  The steamed clams were overcooked and rubbery.  They also didn't seem fresh to any extent.  The fish and chips had a nice golden breading but no seasoning.  The fried chicken had zero seasoning and frankly the coating fell off in big chunks.  I could live with that if it tasted better.  The other stuff was ok based on what everybody said during dinner.  The consensus was that it was average at best but none of us would rush back.  The server was very nice but the actual service was disjointed.  Didn't offer bread so we asked and she brought bread for only 3 people after we already had apps.  We had to ask again and say that everyone, all 6, wanted a piece of bread.  Getting condiments required us asking 3 or 4 times because we would ask for vinegar, for example, and she would run off before we could state the other items we needed.  If you give someone fish and chips just give them vinegar in case they want some.  I've reviewed 200 or 300 restaurants on Yelp and always try to be fair but this really was disappointing.  The fact that the reviews average at 4 1/2 for this place either tells me that my fellow locals and/or reviewers haven't ventured out much to other places to eat that actually are 4's or above OR maybe they are just delusional.  Either way, go see for yourself and I hope that you have a better experience than the 6 of us did.  The ambiance is fine and it's clean, which is a good start.  The food needed help the evening we went."}
{"text":"Our newest neighborhood place open just a week now. Great concept \"Steam Pot\" cooking.  Your meal prepared in front of you, if you're sitting at the huge 30 seat horseshoe shaped bar. Raw ingredients go in with the appropriate sauce special steam jacketed pots cook every thing in a flash and it's served up piping hot with some crusty sour dough bread."}
{"text":"It is a common refrain that you cannot find good seafood in the Phoenix area, and until now I have found that to be pretty much true.  However, High Tide is the exception to the rule.  The seafood is flown in daily and it shows.  The menu is not huge, but offers enough interesting options to satisfy most.  There are even a number of non seafood options available.  Service was adequate, and the prices are fair given the quality of the food.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"My fish and chips fix. Thin type fries and classic light-ish breading on the cod. Not healthy, and really good. Big place, packed and very friendly. It has a huge wraparound bar and a big menu. With all the great reviews I'm looking forward to going back for some fish."}
{"text":"The lobster bisque is addictive! 
Oyster shooters were delicious as well. 
Lobster mac n cheese was very good and very filling."}
{"text":"The decor of this restaurant is open and airy. Of course, the theme is beach & sea. The little oil light on the table is in a bowl full of sand and seashells. 

The service staff is friendly, yet polite, & efficient. 

The Ballast Point Grapefruit Sculpin is refreshing & very good. 

The fish taco is an off-menu item. Patrons can order as many fish tacos as they want, but 2 / person are typical.  The fish and all the other ingredients tasted fresh. But the batter around the piece of fish was too thick in my opinion. The dish was presented beautifully, which might set my expectations too high.

The fish in the fish & chips dish suffered the problem. Again, the fish itself was fresh but its batter was too thick. All the other ingredients were fresh & tasted good. I particularly liked the regular and sweet potato fries. They were cut & cooked just right. Again, the dish was nicely presented, which could set expectations too high. 

The overly thick batter of the fish in both dishes we ordered diminished their quality, goodness, and nice presentation. A lighter batter, which could just as crispy, would be much better. 

Recommendation: Neutral."}
{"text":"Overrated.  Overpriced.  To much pride and ego for an inferior product.

My girlfriend and I went in looking for Oysters. High Tide had been recommended to her by her boss. I have to say for the most part we were unimpressed and found the majority of the price points to be inflated. 

While neither of us are Oyster aficionados by any means, we know what we like and came here because we had a craving. We sat at the bar, which is an open style Oyster Bar.  Two guys in ratty t-shirts were working. We were a bit put off when one of the guys grabbed what was obviously our ticket, hand it to the other worker and make some sort of comment about it being \"his turn.\" There was a groan and a roll of the eyes as he looked at the ticket. Since the next thing he did was shuck our oysters, we already felt a bit awkward as if we were putting the two guys out for doing their job. 

More importantly, the oysters were tiny and fair at best. $34 for the smallest oysters I have ever seen was a bit disappointing. Again, we aren't oyster aficionados, so maybe it's a fancy type of oyster we aren't aware of. 

We didn't finish our order or our drinks. We paid out our tab and had dinner elsewhere. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We went for our 7 year anniversary dinner. Walking up you're not sure what you are getting as the outside is simple and clean; it looks really nice. Inside is exactly the same, very clean and simple. It is a modern take on beach/seaside decor without going tacky. It's a much bigger place on the inside than it appears on the outside. There is a nice bar and large TV screens for watching the game.

 I don't eat seafood so I had the fried chicken and it was really good, the green beans and potatoes were incredible. My husband had one of the sample platters on the appetizer menu. He was in heaven! On the way home he kept saying how good everything was. This is not your typical Red Lobster seafood. These are actual huge crab legs and I have never seen shrimp that big before. Since we were celebrating our anniversary they comped us a dessert. We had several choices but we chose bread pudding. It was fantastic!  Ashley, our server,  and the manager (didn't catch her name) are super sweet ladies and really made our meal so enjoyable."}
{"text":"I travel the country and these people take pride in the fare they serve. A must stop,good happy hour live music and awesome Food!"}
{"text":"On date, we had the pinot grigio with a shot of absolut vodka in it and peach moscow mule.  For dinner, we had the King Crab Legs 1/2 lb.  This was round two after coming from Blue Wasabi so we only ate light.

The moscow mule tasted like crap like 1.0 star, really bad.  Should have returned it. 

Pino Grigio with vodka was good.

The King Crab Legs were like a 3.0 stars compared to Seattle's best places.  But then again, it's only half the price.  For Phoenix standards, since we are nowhere near up north where the cold waters are, it would be 4.0 stars.  Not super fresh but not great either.  It was okay.

I had some great red snapper at their sister restaurant next door so I assume we chose the wrong dish tonight. :)  Really nice weather and ambiance eating in the patio area.  Nice cool breeze."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Great food! Great service! Great food! :) great for lunch and dinner! Freshest seafood in Gilbert. And if you sit at the bar, you get to see it all cooked right in front if you. They are a great addition to Gilbert and worth whatever drive you may have to get here."}
{"text":"It's cold outside, and when it's cold I crave soup.  So I came here for a lunch break to try the Clam Chowder. As I arrived I was seated right away, and ordered the soup and a side of sour dough bread. It came out within 5 minutes after placing the order. The soup came steaming hot with two clams on the top. The soup itself had tons of clam meat and other diced up veggies. The flavor overall was good but it was a little saltier then how I would like it. Even though it was slilghtly salty to my taste, it definitely hit the spot and satisfied my craving. The rolls where pretty spot on for sour dough. 

The service was very attentive."}
{"text":"My friend and I found High Tide Seafood Bar on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  We are so happy we did!

This restaurant is tucked away in a strip mall off Val Vista in Gilbert, and outside looks are somewhat deceiving.  It looks kinda bland.  But upon entering we were very pleasantly surprised to find a large, open, well-appointed contemporary space.  Very clean and inviting.

We were greeted and seated very quickly  in a roomy booth.  Our server, Sarah, was at our table promptly and answered a couple of questions about the menu and made sure we knew about the Happy Hour specials.  We ordered our drinks and a Crab Cheese Bread, which was 2 dollars off on the Happy Hour menu.  The Crab Cheese Bread was a perfect appetizer - nicely toasted with a distinct crab flavor under the cheese.  

My friend ordered the Enchilada Del Mar.  i had a taste and can attest to the deliciousness of this dish.  It was loaded with seafood, wrapped in a very thin (almost like a crepe) enchilada, and covered in a creamy sauce.  It was served with a very generous portion of red beans and rice.  YUMMMM!

I had the steamed mussels which were excellent.  Generous portion of large, juicy mussels in a delicious white wine/garlic broth.  The dish came with a side of bread for dipping in the broth.  A minor quibble I have on this dish is that the broth could have had more garlic for my taste.  Of course this is purely a matter of personal taste, so I certainly won't ding the restaurant because off this.

All in all, we enjoyed outstanding food and service.  We are eager to return and try new dishes."}
{"text":"Went here recently after hearing great reports from friends.  We were not disappointed.  Its not part of the lip downtown Gilbert restaurant scene, but who cares. Talk about superb! We deliberately went for Happy Hour.   We ordered crab cake, lobster mac n' cheese, and calamari sticks.  OMG!  Each one was better than the next.  Portions were most generous.  The crab cake was absolutely excellent.  It was about the size of a hockey puck and just full of succulent crab meat.  I love fried calamari and have enjoyed them immensely at another Gilbert restaurant, but these are the prize winner.  Crisp, tasty, melt in your mouth.  Give me another order to take home!!!  And, finally, the lobster mac n' cheese.  Had we known we would have just ordered that.  The portion was huge.  Our waiter had warned us we'd take some home, and we did.  After  devouring the crab and the calamari I nearly had to force myself to nibble at the mac n' cheese.  Thank God I did.  It was superb.  The cheese sauce was thick, creamy, and plentiful.  And the dish was loaded with lobster pieces.  The Happy Hour price is $11 and worth every penny.  We took the bulk of it home and I'm looking forward to having it tonite.  Our waiter, Randy, was excellent, providing a lot of insight into menu items, wines, and the restaurant itself.  The decor is very up-to-date, contemporary with a real \"with it\" vibe.  We plan on returning again and again to try the entre' items and more of the Happy Hour items.  If this place maintains its standards as we experienced on our first, and only, visit, it will be around for a long time.  Thank goodness!"}
{"text":"I am not a \"religious\" yelper what-so-ever , with that being said, I take my time to write something good vs complaining because my time and energy is very limited. My 1st visit was a total success. Customer service was absolutely outstanding!!! Our server stayed after hours to ensure that we leave their restaurant with the complete satisfaction. Food was amazing. From oysters to calamari to scallops to tuna poke. Presentation was even better. Highly recommend this restaurant for all the foodies. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Positively the best Cioppino I've have ever had!! I'm from Seattle so I have high expectations when it comes to seafood. High Tide did not disappoint, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to this place last week and caught their awesome happy hour. Beer selection was good, but as an avid Craft Beer drinker I could have used a few better options. The decor is cool and nestled into a strip mall in Gilbert this was not at all what I was expecting.

We sat at the bar right by the steam pots and the chef working was friendly and I was really blown away by the cleanliness of the line and the overall restaurant. We got the lobster Mac and Cheese and it was great, could have used a pinch more salt but I really enjoyed it and it was huge!! We got Oysters as well to start and I could tell they were good and fresh, then we split the Cioppino  for an entree. It was really tasty, especially after adding a good scoop of their homemade hot sauce, YUM! My only complaint was that the bread served with it was bleh. It tasted old, and was a product that tasted par baked then finished in the oven. When I have a soupy Cioppino, I like a great piece of grilled bread to soak up all the yums. 

I cannot wait to come back for reverse happy hour and also to try more from the menu. I hope this place does well, its nice to have a great seafood spot so close to home. Overall I suggest you try it!"}
{"text":"Best Place Ever:) Happy hour 3-7 7 days a week! Mussels,Clams,Oysters on the half shell to die for!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find good seafood in Arizona, for obvious reasons, but this place hits it out of the park. Huge portions of food, great drink selections, and a very nice environment. 

The Lobster mac and cheese app is amazing and more than enough for 4+ people to share, by far one of our favorite things. Fish and chips, salmon and side are all exceptional as well. 

Have only been there a few times, but have yet to have had a bad experience. Will definitely keep coming back"}
{"text":"So nice having a great seafood place here in Gilbert.  Every meal has been consistently good."}
{"text":"Open and inviting, this place is great, can't wait to go back.  Went in just after the normal lunch hour and was treated fantastic.  The staff is warm and welcoming, the atmosphere is open and well lit.  I went there for a dozen fresh oysters on the half shell and some good beer and that's exactly what I got.  It was great!  

My wife ordered the cioppino and an oyster bloody Mary, she loved it!  My daughter had the surf and turf burger and left nothing for her dad.  Great food, good time, wonderful people and reasonable prices.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was good, the oysters were very salty. The happy hour is amazing and the lobster bisque is to die for!!! We had the jambalaya and it was really good. They have very big portions so come with an appetite. Brittany was our server and she was wonderful!! I would highly recommend this place with a family or for a date!!!"}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times, great food. Me and my brother were planning on taking my mom here yesterday for early mothers day dinner. Made a reservation for 615, told us there is a wait. Mmm. Normally if u have a reservation u don't wait. Still wasn't seated my 630 people were getting seated before us... So we left and went to the sushi restaurant across the street which was awesome! Though it's unfortunate for this restaurant because we did love it before this happened. All I have to say is don't fuss about making a reservation because it doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends for dinner and managed to catch happy hour. The decor is modern and TVs around the place which was important for the guys since we are in playoff season. The happy hour menu has tons of stuff and great deals on drinks- $4 for house wine is a pretty good start. Lobster Mac n cheese is a must. Crab cake was not enough for sharing. That was good but least favorite item. The beer steamed clams we good. Ask for some rolls for that delicious broth. For dinner my husband and I split a steam pot called the tide roast. Beautiful tomato cream sauce, tons of shrimp, crawfish and clams. On of the best meals I have had in a very long time. Service was good. Took a while to get our drinks initially, but after that no problem. This place is worth the drive to Gilbert. Go now!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are so many 5 stars.  My wife and I were waiting for this place to open for awhile and when we saw it had many 5 stars after it opened we were very excited.  Overall, we were dissappointed with the experience.  She had the shrimp po boy which I also tasted.  She did not finish it.  The shrimp was very small and over breaded.  I picked the breading off and the shrimp alone wasn't that great.  I had the salmon sandwich.  The salmon was good but they put too much sauce on each of the buns and I couldn't really taste the fish.  It also has bacon on it but could probably do without.  The person who took our order was very nice but did not stop by very often to check on us.  He only stopped by to take the order, deliver the food, and drop off the check.  I also was dissappointed with the amount of fish options on the menu.  The name tells me it's a seafood place but when we stopped for lunch the first things I saw on the menu were burger, chicken, fried tomato and then a fish sandwich.  I expected other fish options like Mahi or Tilapia.  I can even get those at a fast food place."}
{"text":"I wanted some clam chowder and since we live in gilbert wanted to try this place. Restaurant is well decor and clean and people are lay back and friendly. My husband tried their fish and chips and I had bowl of chowder.  Their portions were huge so we didn't need appetizers. I wasn't impressed with their fried fish. It was too breaded and chowder wasn't as good as the ones I had in San Diego. We will go back to try other dishes. I want to support our Gilbert local restaurants."}
{"text":"You will love this place! Get the Cioppino. The service is great, the servers remember us every time we come in. We love to sit at the seafood bar and watch the cooks. If you go on the weekend, make a reservation."}
{"text":"Always the best experience. 
Amazing service, awesome and fresh food and cocktails. Our large group had the best lobster bisque soup we've ever had. Everyone was so pleased with their meals and cocktails. The service is always top notch too. 

Support local, family owned and operated."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Food was fresh and good.  Price good.  Highly recommend High Tide you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"I try to be very fair when reviewing any restaurant. If I write something praiseful I hope the establishment will graciously accept and consider it a job well done. In turn if I have something critical to say I hope they will take an objective look at the content of my review and reflect upon the my words. I think this preamble is important whenever there are so many glowing reviews.

I have had seafood from Boston down to Key West and San Francisco to San Diego. It's not to brag it's just that I've had a lot to compare with High Tides.

My overall impression of the food is to put it on a par with what one might get at Red Lobster. Now before everyone who loves this restaurant thinks I am a hater let me explain. I enjoyed my meal there even though the service was mediocre at best. The menu items are much more creative then a Red Lobster for sure but the quality of the ingredients are just average. The same with the preparation.

The Clam Chowder was nice enough and it's a nice touch to have a whole clam floating on the top, err, I mean sunk to the bottom. The Steamed Black Mussels were a bit mealy and the broth was very salty. Wasn't the kind that made you want to use the roll to sop it all up.

The King Steam Pot was pleasant and claimed to have a Light Saffron Cream Sauce. It wasn't very \"light\" and tasted more of lemon then saffron.

Not a place I'll be going back to unfortunately."}
{"text":"$60 for mediocre lunch for two.  Not impressed.  The food was OK. The decor was nice, the staff was friendly.  But, the food was poor to fair. Not my favorite."}
{"text":"The food was just ok, but when I spend $30 on a dish, I expect it to be amazing or at least great. Definitely not worth the price. I probably won't ever go back."}
{"text":"I love having a close oyster house, 3 different oysters. Outside seating or bar/booth. Love their seafood selection."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in gilbert. All the seafood is fresh and the drinks are very well priced. Definitely a once a month visit if you life in the area."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Blondie - The Tide Is High)

The Tide is High at the seafood bar
It's gonna be your number one
I'm not the kind of Yelper who gives up just like that, oh no ooo.

It's not the fish you do that taste and serves me bad
But it's the way your food is good that does me well

I'm not the kind of Yelper who gives up just like that, oh no ooo.
The Tide is High at the seafood bar
It's gonna be your number one.....number one....number one.


I'm not a fan of seafood even though my mother would kick in the butt for saying; why don't you like expensive food!?  Mom, it's not the cost that makes the food great!

Needless to say, I came to High Tide with a large group of friends for a birthday dinner.  Seafood in the valley has always been okay for me; we live in the desert!  First thing I noticed about this place is the large round counter where they serve oysters and drinks; nice!  Still a skeptic I ordered their Baja White Seabass since it seemed like a safe bet.  The Seabass was breaded and had a crunchy crust and cooked to perfection atop a bed of creamy risotto.  It was definitely the risotto that made my palettes pop.  The dish was served with asparagus and a citrus Beurre Blanc sauce.  Overall, I was pretty impressed with my entree.  It was a tad bit on the salty side, but nothing I couldn't handle.  

In the end, High Tide is a pretty sold seafood spot in my books especially in Gilbert AZ! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My spouse and I agree we had a 3/5 star experience. I ordered a bloody Mary, which looked good and tasted good, EXCEPT they serve it in a glass of crushed ice- something I've never seen, and for good reason. The crushed ice melts quickly and get sucked up your straw each time you take a drink. If you don't use the straw, you have to grit your teeth while drinking to strain out the crushed ice from entering your mouth. My spouse ordered the Baja Sea Bass and it was good. I ordered the scallops and they were good, but the polenta they served it with was congealed and lumpy, and they put two cherries on it- the juice from the cherries naturally leaked on top of the polenta and it looked like bloody polenta. They should skip the cherries. Both of us had asparagus as our veggie and it was small, limp, and disappointing. Our server, Chrissy, was the best part of our dinner. She was attentive and very friendly."}
{"text":"Overall good but not as impressed as I had hoped. We ordered the steamed mussels which were ok, then I had lobster Mac n cheese and my husband had a seafood broth soup. His was pretty good but mine was average. 16 dollars for this Mac n cheese and I was not impressed. Lacked some depth and flavor. We waited about 45 for our food, and they brought us bread about 50 minutes after we arrived because they ran out and were making more. We had to remind our waitress for more drinks twice, it just seemed they weren't on the ball. I would come back and order the calamari and maybe fish and chips? Wasn't bad tasted fresh ;but for the money I expected better food/service,"}
{"text":"Summer and Dan are the very best, we had such amazing service!
They were so helpful and personable!
The food is amazing as well!
I will most definitely be recommending this place to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"One of the best seafood restaurants in Arizona. We had the ceviche, spicy seafood pasta, and the King. All of the food was fantastic and our waitress was great. They have a nice beer selection too!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, so they were not too busy. The restaurant's sea-like aesthetics was very nice and nostalgic for someone who grew up on the coast.

We had the calamari and lobster mac n' cheese for starters. Their calamari is not what I'm used to, they were shaped like mozzarella sticks. Besides this, it made a great combo with their lemon aioli sauce. 

For the main courses, we got the salmon blt and the spicy seafood pasta. The salmon blt was pretty average, but still good though. The meat:noodles ratio in the seafood pasta was pretty nice but the spicy tomato cream sauce was lacking a little in the kick department. 

Overall, High Tide is very clean, has friendly staff, and good food (a bit expensive)."}
{"text":"It is tough to find a quality seafood restaurant on this side of town but this place definitely delivered. We came on the reccomendation from other guests and we had an amazing experience. Service was great, very friendly and attentive. I believe our servers name was Dave and he was fantastic.

As the GM of another valley restaurant,  I tend to be very focused on the details of my experience and I can say I left with no complaints. 

If you're looking for a quality seafood joint in the gilbert chandler area, this is the one.

...and try the seared halibut with grilled asparagus..."}
{"text":"The food came out hot and the servers were excellent. The decor was nice and it didn't have a strong seafood smell in the place. The prices were up there but it was worthy of them. We are in the dessert and to have this place is great."}
{"text":"First time here, loved the calamari! And the creme brulee is worth the drive on its own! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Imagined hype is something people flock to but having Red Lobster quality seafood cooked in a pot of uninspired, soupy sauces well, that's what people are buying. Because they're in a pot. And those that say you need to sit at the bar like I did to see the \"magic\" well, I like a show too. But servers that took 10 minutes to even recognize that you were sitting there was hoping there would be a bit of enthusiasm from the ones that were making meals in the pot. Nothing. Not any more interaction than none of us get from anyone in the back of the house. Everyone is entitled to a bad night but for what they charge, and the quality that comes with it not willing to come back to prove myself wrong."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday last night, made an reservation for 8, got there a little early, server greeted me promptly and asked if it was my birthday, then told me to save room for my free birthday dessert. Our table was a huge booth, which was great, but I don't think they really thought the whole concept through, 8 adults sitting in a booth.. going in and out for the restroom was tough, along with food being passed, especially with plates being scalding hot, and patrons have to pass them down..not the best idea!

We started off with appetizers, calamari, lobster mac and cheese, lobster bisque and crab cakes. Calamari was good, texture was like mozzarella sticks, so not incredibly chewy, lobster mac and cheese had a decent amount of lobster in there,but a huge portion, a bit bland for my taste though and the crab cakes were okay as well. Then the lobster bisque that everyone raved about, had decent amount of lobster, but was slightly cold, not a fan of coldish soup.

Main dish, spouse got the High Tide burger and I got \"the King\", his burger wasn't medium rare like he asked and also was missing some stuff in it, but the food took so long and our server was incredibly busy he ate under half and left it there, our server told her manager, they never stopped by to apologize or anything and I guess took a few bucks off our bill. My entrée the king was pretty good, except for the fact that it came out barely warm.. great portion of seafood in it though, took a few bites and just brought it home. After I was finished our server asked if I was ready for my birthday dessert, I chose the bread pudding, it was okay, I've had better.

Our server looked like she was the only one working or something because she was running around and barely had time to check up on us or prebus our table, so it was a hot mess.

We asked for our checks and gave her our \"passport dining\" card [which is also how I found out about the place], we should have gotten one entrée free or 20% off the entire bill [I think there's a mess up on their site], but on our bill, said we only got around $9 taken off, and it looked like my birthday dessert I paid for and only $3 dollars got taken off for my spouse's burger. So, not too sure if we read our bill wrong of what got discounted but either way, being a server myself we cut her some slack and tipped her $10 on top of the $15 gratuity they added on already. 
All in all, wasn't the best place, but also not the worst I've had my birthday at.

Might come back just for happy hour, one day."}
{"text":"Great & attentive service. Enjoyed a nice dinner out on the patio. I highly recommend getting the fish & chips and splurging a bit to get halibut instead of cod as your fish. Outstanding! My sides were good but not outstanding - I tried peach cashew coleslaw & whipped potatoes. I tasted one of my husband's green beans, which I liked better. We shared the warm kale, pear, walnut salad which was really good too. My dinner was very filling! Had to get a to-go box. Overall, I'd definitely come back to try more foods, esp when craving a good piece of fish."}
{"text":"This was our second time and even better. Everyone at our table ordered the king crab legs and they were huge and delicious. I ordered the braised short beef ribs. OMG - I licked the plate. It came with buttery delicious mashed potatoes and cooked carrots - the beef portion was enormous!!!! the beef was very tender and cooked to perfection. The potatoes amazing and the carrots were perfect. Our server was so professional and super friendly (forgot her name- ugh). We did not wait long at all for the food. The service there is top-notch!!! I cannot wait to go back again. The decor is wonderful as well - we sat in an oversized comfy booth!!! You must must must go !!!!!"}
{"text":"I think it can be challenging to find good seafood in the desert but High Tide is amazing! It's located on the southwest corner of Val Vista and Williams Field Rd in a shopping complex. Hubby and I came on a Tuesday evening, so it wasn't crowded. I really liked the ambience of the restaurant and the smell of seafood as you walk in. Service was great- I also enjoyed reading their weekly specials board. We started with the calamari, which was probably the best I've ever had! The dipping sauces are great, perfectly breaded and not chewy. I ordered the Tide Roast steam pot and my husband ordered the gumbo. Both of us raved about our food and loved how much seafood we got in each dish! I probably counted 15 shrimp in mine along with the crab and crawfish meats. It also came with rolls, which were perfect to dip in our entrees! I also liked on the menu that there were other options for those who don't like or eat seafood. Honestly, I will always eat the seafood when I come back!

Overall, High Tide was great and we cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar and as expected, LOVED IT! Business has certainly  INCREASED. Seating only at the bar with a 20 min.wait for dining room, at 8pm on a Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Fantastic service. Beautiful restaurant. I ordered \"The King\" which is a pasta dish with basically all things seafood over pasta,and it was amazing. It comes woth a large king crab leg on top,pre cracked so you can devour it quickly and easily. I had the dinner portion,and the only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because that portion was smaller  (or verrry close in size) to the lobster Mac and Cheese appetizer we ordered.  Also cause I'm trying to break my habit of giving either 5 stars or 1 star to a place, as I tend to only Yelp review things that are either realllly good or realllly bad.  If this was one month ago I would have rated this 5 stars :) Anyway, had I known how big it would be I would have opted for the lunch portion. Regardless,it was all delicious. The wife ordered the Tide Roast. \"Super yummy\" is her description, and she did get the lunch portion and it was still a pretty large amount. We will definitely be back,I'll just order the lunch rather than the dinner portion. Again,delicious food,great drink list,quick service."}
{"text":"We have visited 3 times, trying something different each time we went.  Mussels, Fried Calamari, Steam Pots and even the Crab Cheeseburger were all on point.  They have a decent happy hour that put our bill into the $50 range for the two of us - 2 happy hour specials, (1) $15 entree and 2 happy hour beers.

The only reason I give them 4, instead of 5 stars is the price.  $33 for a dozen oysters is high, Casey Moore's runs $14 (happy hour).

All in all I walk away happy, with a smile on my face after enjoying a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  We had the Calamari appetizer, lobster bisque and shared a fish and chips with fries and Mac and cheese. Everything was so good!  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!

Drinks: amazing! I had the pear martini I forget the exact name but it was perfect. not overly sweet in my opinion

Food: what's not good?!
Calamari: they give you the calamari tenders instead of the chewy rings.  You can tell its very fresh and its perfectly breaded.  The dipping sauce is amazing
lobster bisque: one of my favorite lobster bisques i've ever had.
Tide Roast: combination of different shellfish/seafood in a tomato based broth with a big pile or rice. Delicious!
Fish and Chips: perfectly crispy, really good whole grain mustard dipping sauce

Honestly you can't go wrong here. everything is really good and the staff is very friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Had Lobster Mac and Cheese as an appetizer and great happy hour drink specials with good craft beers. My wife had the seafood gumbo which she raved about and I had the fish and chips. The fish was light and delicious. We had the bread pudding for dessert and it was unexpectedly light and one of the best desserts I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Belle of the ball: short ribs!  Salmon also delicious. Walked in early Saturday eve so it's s great option when San Tan restaurants have LONG waits. Happy hour specials til 6:30 Sat. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"3 of 5 stars  Pending review 

Not a bad place, The steam pots are good but lack much seafood, A lot of pasta.I got the King pot, Sweet King Crab, Scallops, Salmon, Calamari, Citrus Scented Mushrooms & Roasted Tomato Simmered in Light Saffron Cream Sauce Served Over Pasta, again a lot of pasta, The crab consists a of a little leg, I do mean little,  It looked like snow crab leg. 2 scallops(small), a couple of small pieces of salmon, the calamari must have gotten a pardon, No where to be seen. It was sort of like hide and seek, I keep seeking for the seafood. 28 bucks and no sides. Salad and bread are extra. Sauce was good. This place has potential because the food is of good quality, but they need to give the customer more for their money, at least with these Steam Pots. My wife order the fish and chips. For some reason my Steam Pot order got lost so we sat there for 30 minutes waiting. I saw my wife's order at the window and asked what the problem was. Manager came over and fixed the problem and had a new order of the fish and chips and the King Pot delivered as well as a complimentary drink. Very well managed. Need more seafood in the Pots!"}
{"text":"This store is privatly owned and chef managed. 9 points just for that alone :)  To Drink: We scoured their wine cellar and found a very good quality selection. We started out with a wine tasting to select our dinner wine and they more than obliged.  Our waiter knew his wines. That is 10 points all by itself. They also have a reserve wine list !!  We drank the Oyster Bay Sav Blanc with our meal. 
Appetizers:  We ordered the calamari and a crab cake for appetizer. The crab cake is top notch. Well prepared and very very tasty. Almost a meal on its own! The calamari was very good but could have slightly less breading. Overall the appetizers get 10 out of 10 points. 
Entrees:  We ordered the salmon, medium, and pan seared cali halibut. The salmon comes with pan cooked broccolini over a bed of lemon risotto. SPOT ON DISH!!  12 points out of 10 for this salmon dish. The lemon infused risotto is heavenly. The pan seared halibut comes with leeks in the pan sauce, smashed potato infused with beet puree, and grilled asparagus. NAILED IT!!  The fish filet was so fresh and well prepared i was in shock. The asparagus was done PERFECTLY. I took a pot of the potato puree and the lemon risotto home :)  not really, but would if we could! 
Coming back. Money well spent. Gotta taste the immaculate desserts. Great place to eat!!!  Top notch service!!!  Thanks for a great meal :)"}
{"text":"We have never had a bad experience here. It has a nice atmosphere and has a dining area, bar, and patio. The fish and chips are very good and my wife has got steam pots and she really liked those. Recently we have been getting the Surf and Turf burgers and that might actually be our favorite (it comes with crab on it). The service is always good too. We just had Zack for our last meal and he was very friendly and professional. We recommend High Tide and will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Back again for D's annual birthday dinner. 
- Dozen oysters were fine, but didn't love the mignonette
- Caesar salad was basic
- Scallops- big and perfectly cooked, but didn't love the orzo that came with and the side veg was meh. Many of dishes come with a citrus beurre blanc sauce which was fine, but heavy, so might ask if they can keep on the side next time.
- B had the halibut special over crab risotto. Sounded good, but just OK

The place gets super crowded during HH, even on a Monday night. Not that good and definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Unbelievable Fish and chips, best lobster bisque and calamari I have EVER had. Lobster Mac and Cheese was really good. Bloody Mary bar looked great. 

This place is amazing. Really good service. You should sit at the bar at least once and watch the steam pots and the chefs at work."}
{"text":"I almost gave a lower rating... service is way too pushy! I literally just put my last bite in my mouth and my plate was being taken away. Then before I could swallow my bill arrived. Wow. There were plenty of seats so why the rush?! The save for a better rate is great food."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I sat at the bar solo and enjoyed myself. I will be coming back with friends and family."}
{"text":"Best reverse Happy Hour in the east valley."}
{"text":"Celebrated our anniversary with dinner at high tide. Our waiter suggested some of the most delicious oysters and I have never had calamari so tasty and huge. Fabulous martini and I could have licked my dish clean from the lobster bisque and tide roast with dirty rice. I plan on celebrating here every year."}
{"text":"This place is as fresh as it gets in the Valley of the Sun! The atmosphere takes you right to the beach and the staff is always friendly and helpful. I love their lobster bisque and often order a bowl of that with a salad and it is more than enough. Their seafood is never fishy and always tastes fresh which is rare in Arizona. Try their lobster mac n' cheese, it's to die for!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place! Finally amazing seafood in the desert. TY HT!"}
{"text":"If you have not been here before... You're missing out! Get the gumbo... Or the fresh salmon... Or the lobster bisque.. Or the King. .. Or the beer clams... Or the fried chicken (weird I know right? A place like this to sell fried chicken? But they do!! And it's totally awesome!!)). Heck get it all! You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for a great place to get oysters and we stumbled upon a gem. The food is so delicious. A bit on the pricey side but worth every penny. Great date night destination."}
{"text":"THE BEST!! We tried High Tide for the first time this week. 

The prices were what you would expect for a quality seafood restaurant but well worth the price. Fortunately, their happy hour runs until 6:30 so we arrived in time to enjoy happy hour prices.

The service was excellent! We loved sitting at the bar watching the seafood being steamed and prepped. 

I ordered the happy hour crab cake with fried avocado and micro greens as my entree as didn't know how big it would be and was content to order more food it didn't fill me up. I don't have a very large appetite.

The crab cake was DELICIOUS and ample size for me!! The avocado was a bit greasy but I was able to easily remove the fried coating and eat the perfect avocado with the crab cake and micro greens.

My fiancé ordered salmon salad and said it was perfectly prepared, which is saying a lot as he's very particular about salmon.

We will definitely be back as there are so many other items that we want to try!"}
{"text":"Dropped in during Happy Hour for an early dinner. The waiters and manager worked well as a team to get the place ready for the evening crowd - nice to see the camaraderie. 

The prices drop $5 on the lobster mac-n-cheese to $11. Delicious, rich cheese, yet at the same time not too heavy. It seemed like a strange at first, but not so. The lobster didn't overpower the dish. 

Pan-Seared Halibut was very flavorful which included a nice pairing of grilled leaks on top. Cesar salad was to die for - a really nice tang because there are anchovies in the dressing. A slice of lemon fused all the flavors - a wise tip from the waitress. Fried okra was...fried okra. I'm used to Indian dishes with saucy okra; can't deduct a star for me not being used to this dish. 

Ladies, the bathrooms are classy. A blue translucent tile sweeps the walls at eye level. The lower part of the wall has a dark-medium brown wood. The sink has iridescent seashells, similar to a mosaic. Just a beautiful room."}
{"text":"After reading the write up on the restaurant  web site I was anticipating  a extraordinary dinning experience. Maybe because it was Monday night and a holiday(MLK) that  the kitchen was not up to par.  
We were promptly greeted at the door on arrival and seated. Our waitress  arrived within minutes to take our drink orders and when asked told us about the evening specials.  We ordered drinks and the calamari appetizer .  My wife sent her dirty martini back right off because it wasn't \"dirty enough\" it returned problem solved. The calamari arrived with garlic aioli and a spicy tomato cream on the side.  The calamari was beautifully crisp with a panco  crust.  The aioli was fantastic with just enough garlic but the tomato cream was bland as tomato soup. For a main course I ordered the special stuffed Red Snapper with risotto and asparagus.   My wife the spicy seafood pasta. We also each ordered a very good, what they describe as a small caesar salad, that were very generous with fresh house make croutons and dressing.  The main course selections arrive and my wife's seafood pasta was wonderful with plenty of fresh fish and seafood in a spicy marinara .  My baked snapper was sitting in a pool of cheese sauce with rice nothing vaguely resembling risotto but closer to Mac & Cheese.   The Red Snapper was stuffed with a mixture of spinach,capers, onion, pimento,crab, artichoke hearts and breadcrumbs .  Now stuffing is supposed to be simple and enhance a dish.  This combination totally overwhelmed the fish and just didn't work.   I find it hard to believe that anyone tasted that stuffing in the kitchen. Not at all what I expected.   It's a very attractive setting and some of our food was excellent.   I'm not sure we will return."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice, once for dinner and the other time to watch football on a Sunday morning. On Sunday they had all the NFL games on which was a plus. We had planned to go to a sports bar across the street but the place was packed and it was going to be 45 minutes for a table.
I think the food at high tide is average but expensive for the area. 
Service is very good. Both times I have been at High Tide, they had more employees than customers. Beers are much higher priced than other bars in the area. The interior is nice with a sort of industrial look."}
{"text":"Don't let the retail strip mall fool you!  This place is so good!  The Lobster Mac N Cheese is amazing!  Yes, it's an appetizer, but some may eat it as an entree.   Burgers are great, fish and chips great, gumbo great, grilled fish great, lobster bisque is WOW!!!!  Everything is really good!!!  Well, maybe not the coleslaw.....but my mother likes it!

We have always had great service too.  I can honestly say we haven't had a bad experience.  Anytime we have taken friends or family, they've loved it as well.  

High Tide is less than 2 miles west of the Santan Mall.  Do a little shopping, then leave the mall crowd for a delicious meal!!!

Weekdays are not too crowded, but you will want a reservation for the weekend."}
{"text":"This place was GREAT! Service was fantastic. Food was awesome. The MAC n Cheese and Bread Pudding are a must try."}
{"text":"Friend invited me to this place.  I ordered salmon and it was very good.  My appetizer was ceviche and was the best I have had in a long time.  cucumber drink was very refreshing and thirst quenching. Food was great and services was good."}
{"text":"This was an awful experience!!!!! We waited 40 minutes for our food. When it arrived, the scallops were not hot. The halibut was awesome , but everything on the plate was luke-warm. The topper on this experience was the manager telling me that the owner \"felt\" the scallops and they were hot! She argues with the customer??????? The ONLY shining star in this entire horrible dinner was the server Summer. She was absolutely wonderful. I feel bad that she had to work for such an awful boss!!!! I watched the owner and manager talk about us for 5 minutes before the manager had to come deal with us. Good job with taking pride over your business!"}
{"text":"SOOOOOOO Good! We had Oysters, Calamari, Lobster Mac-n-Chz. Very nice inside, very nice people. Our server was amazing and nice. The ONLY thing I have negative to say is that our finished drinks and plates stayed on the table and were never removed as we were done with each and maybe that sounds petty, but I was a waitress for 7 years and people like their table cleared :) Wonderful food and place!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times.  Very fresh seafood, and friendly waitstaff.  The Seafood Cioppino is unbelievable, as well as the spicy seafood pasta!  Check this place out!  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Solid. We've NEVER had a bad experience here. Food is always delish with interesting options like homemade lobster mac 'n cheese and incredible wings. On occasion the service will be a bit slow, but I attribute Gilbert's rapid growth as partly to blame."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday night.  It was busy.  Waited about 30 minutes for a table.  Service was terrible.  Rarely saw our waitress.  Not a good experience.  My son had the fish and chips which he enjoyed.  We both had the Caesar salad which came out dry.  I asked the waitress for more dressing - she brought some out 15 minutes later.  Said they \"ran out of dressing\" and had to make more.  I had the barramundi fish which was terrible.  It was served over a mush.   I would have sent it back but was tired as it took an hour to get the entrees to our table.  I will not be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Warmly decorated restaurant with attentive staff. Manager was walking around, but did not stop to chat with us. First time and not sure if I'll return because of the distance. Not blown away by the food. Friends had fish and chips and just said it was okay. Fries were lackluster.  Cioppini pot bowl was good, filled with mussels, shrimp and fish. Our waiter was very nice, but just didn't get a welcoming feeling overall. When your blown away by the food that can trump everything else.Ex:  Distance and an aloof manager."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were told by several folks at our country club how good the food is at this place.
We finally got to go on or about Memorial Day. 
We sat at the bar as the place was fairly crowded.
We ordered a bottle of wine and were perusing the menu when my eye was caught by a guy behind the bar. I watched as he took a rag of some sort out of a sink of soapy water, with his little utility/sterile/plastic gloves on, and wiped down what appeared to be a long. white, plastic cutting board.
He then took out a handful of vegetables and began chopping them, WITH THE EXACT SAME GLOVES ON, and put them in a bowl to be served to someone.
As this was happening I was giving my girlfriend a rather mocking play-by-play, both of us in disbelief. Some girl behind the bar said they have a bottle of anti-bacteria they use before they begin cutting veggies.
Ok...fine. Maybe they do have some....but he did not use it. While that makes as much sense as washing Solo cups....gloves are about $0.02 apiece so why not just change them....I watched his entire motion and he never ONE TIME slathered any anti-bacteria on his gloved hands...not even once.
We were extremely disappointed because we REALLY wanted to try their food... but disgusted trumped disappointed that night and we ate elsewhere. Not sure if we'll ever get to go there now since the image of this disgusting person will forever be in our minds....along with the lying girl who was making excuses for him."}
{"text":"First time here.  Nice atmosphere, good service.  Appetizers--I went with the lobster Mac and Cheese since there was lots of recommendations.  This was outstanding.  I'd definitely consider ordering it as my meal.  We also had the calamari which was uniquely prepared.  Crispy outside; delicious inside.  Dipping sauces ok...think this place has potential to make a really unique dipping sauce.  Maybe some Asian inspired dip with jalapeño kick.

Ordered 2 of the steam pot dishes.  It seemed like a lot had cream in them.  Not everyone in my party could do cream.  So, I'd like to challenge them to do a seafood boulliabas (so).  But the seafood in my partners dish was ample.  Lots of shrimp; all seafood cooked just right.  I had a saffron dish that was ok. Maybe I didn't order right dishes for my taste preferences.  I think they have potential to make an awesome risotto.  

Fish and chips looked good.  Drinks look good.  There was a fixings station by the bar...not sure what it was. I didn't notice it until after dinner.  Saw someone grabbing shrimp and other items from it.

I definitely want to go once more and try other items on menu.  I would have loved a Manhattan clam chowder option too.  Maybe a Sushi app."}
{"text":"Very yummy place. The lobster mac and cheese is so devine and my most favorite thing on the menu. My husband and I shared one plate. We had steamers that were good as well. Both times we have come our waiter was very friendly and the service was good."}
{"text":"Really a must-do. We stopped mid afternoon and discovered it was Wine Wednesday at happy hour. We had their \"charcuterie\" plate and the calamari. The calamari was not the typical small rubber bands, but long strips, very tender! The charcuterie plate had crispy flat bread, several nice condiments, pickled onions and a craft mustard and a very ample cheese selection. BUT we decided (the three of us) to share the lobster mac!  Wow this was amazing! Cheesy, full of lobster...wonderful!  Wonderful stop!"}
{"text":"Sat there for 10 minutes and not a single person came by. No drinks, no \"we will be right with you\"... Nothing! So we got up and walked out. On our way out the same lady that sat us ten minutes prior said have a good night and thanks for coming!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff here is so friendly and I think it makes the experience that much better. Their calamari is wonderful - it's not greasy or chewy - it's the best I've had in Gilbert. I also had the lobster mac and cheese. It was good but I think I would try something different our next visit. Everything is reasonably priced and the wait time on a weekend isn't bad at all. The staff wants your visit to be as pleasant as possible and they do a great job showing that they appreciate your business.

We will definitely be back for date night!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the seafood and the service!  Everything was amazing from the fried calamari to the lobster Mac n cheese to the salmon. And huge portions! Who knew such fine dining was in a Gilbert strip mall?! I will spread the word about this joint!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Unique seafood dishes with their Steamed pots.  Never been disappointed with the several kinds we've ordered.  Love the wings as an appy for happy hour.  They're huge!  Also the Calamari appy is unique with bigger pieces and no tentacles that my wifey hates.  Good choice of wines and beer as well.  We frequent here and we'll be back again soon :-)"}
{"text":"At first glance it appears to be your normal mid to high end seafood place.  The oysters on the half shell are by far the creme de la creme of what they have to offer.  Expect to pay a hefty premium for them though ($33/dozen or $26/dozen during happy hour).  Tried the Cioppino and was a bit underwhelming, if not for the terrific oysters this would have been a 3 star experience.  For this price, I'll stick to Pappadeax in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Beautiful outside so we sat on the patio, very nice!  Calamari for an appetizer very well done.  Cod fish and mixed fries with real nice cole slaw with a pecan tapenade.  Ashley had the Louisiana Gumbo nicely flavored.  We'll be back here sometime."}
{"text":"Updated 4/11/2017: I have had so many great follow-on dinners at High Tide I thought I'd let them know. As mentioned in the below original review, I won't order a veggie plate ever again but overall, their food is great and the service is very good. I love sitting at the bar and watching them prepare the food!

Original review:
I typically love High Tide but last night I joined friends there to celebrate a birthday. My tummy had been upset all day so I ordered steamed vegetables. They brought me a tiny plate of green beans, broccoli, and asparagus. They were mediocre at best. When I got my bill they charged me $4 for each vegetable - so it was $12 for a small crappy plate of veggies while my friend pad $10 for her shrimp bowl and another paid $16 for a full plate of fish $ chips with the fabulous peach and macadamia slaw. The comparison of the price and quality of the veggies to the rest of the food at the table was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Service could not have been better, the boiled shrimp taste like home and was a good start to an amazing meal."}
{"text":"Everything we ate was outstanding! Definitely got our money's worth. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"We loved it!  The fish was delicious, fresh, and very reasonably priced. I am only sorry that we didn't come in sooner! :) It is a good place for a casual lunch or a nice dinner out. We tries Tide Roast, Salmon BLT, gumbo, and cioppino and we enjoyed all of it!"}
{"text":"I had some family in town and they wanted some awesome seafood. Me being from Alaska, I'm a little skeptical about my fish. So I did some research, a friend suggested high tide! We had a party of 6 on a Friday night. Busy place! 
We are officially in love. We had the halibut, the salmon, and the king crab legs. All of it was FANTASTIC! Service was great as well! Wie will be back!"}
{"text":"I had their Lobster Bisque and it was delicious.  We sat at the bar to see the steam pots.  Their bread pudding was very good also.  We had a very nice and informative waitress, it was a fun place and we will be returning."}
{"text":"I've always loved coming here, but today the service was horrible. Actually, there was no service. We were told to seat ourselves on the patio and someone would be right out. We waited about 10-15 min and no one showed. Finally when we were about to leave a waiter walked by and said how he liked our dog but payed no attention to the fact that our menus were still on the table and no waters had even been served. He didn't even give us the chance to say anything before he was already inside. We left immediately!"}
{"text":"You can definitely tell that the owner and staff really care about quality and creating a unique experience.  We had the gumbo, the chowder and the cioppino.  All were excellent and the server was great.  The only negative was that the food took a little longer than we would have liked."}
{"text":"My wife & I went to High Tide on a recent date night & had a great dinner.  We thoroughly enjoyed the unique preparation & love that Gilbert has a seafood restaurant of this quality.  We also enjoyed the large bar area and decent wine selection.   This is a restaurant one would expect to see in Scottsdale but were fortunate to have it in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent but the food was just ok, nothing to really write home about! I got the Chilean sea bass and I had three bones with my first bite! I mean really? I know fish have bones but I don't think you should get three bones in your month with your first fork-full. Anyway, I sent it back and got the scallops. They were good, but I'm not a fan of fennel. Yuk! My husband said his food was just okay but not enough to come back. I had the oysters rockafellow and they were tasty but again, I've had better!"}
{"text":"Such great food here, we went on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy. I had the fish and chips and some drinks ! Price wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for a while now, so we stopped in on a Sunday for lunch. We were greeted right away, seated in a booth and started to review the menu. Our waitress came by and took our drink orders and gave is time to review the menu. I decided on the battered shrimp and chips. This included peach coleslaw and tarter sauce. 
After a short wait our food was brought out. There were about 7 to 8 large pieces of shrimp on top of a mix of regular and sweet potatoes fries, a large bowl of coleslaw and tarter sauce. The coleslaw was okay, I am not a huge coleslaw fan though, I thought the tarter sauce was super good, and I thought the batter on the shrimp was yummy, the fries were okay, you could tell they were frozen fries. 
The restaurant was clean and bright, there is  nautical decor theme going on, and the staff is friendly.
Overall, I had a good experience,  but felt the place is a little overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"The best crab legs around... my filet was a little bit over cooked but the crab made up for it and two ladies I was with had the crab meat removed for them. She kept calling it \"lazy man's crab\" . The only down side was 8 adults in a big booth a little crazy handing out dishes. .. love the place though. Ask for Alexandra she was awesome. .."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque was very rich and yummy. 
Crab cake was loaded with crab and yummy. The only thing is the aoli sauce on it was a bit much. The king steam pot was pasta pretty good. I liked the seafood on it but the sauce on the pasta was a little thick and something about the taste of it was a bit much. I can't seem to put my finger on it.  Over all, service and ambiance was good, ticket times were decent, and the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Like the bartender said, this place is a diamond in the rough. If you want fresh seafood in the Gilbert/Mesa area - this is a great place. I like the atmosphere and sitting at the bar for dinner allowed me the chance to ask questions about items on the menu or meals I watched go by - which looked really yummy. I had a half spinach and golden beet salad to go with my entree of sea bass with risotto. Everything was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Went here with some clients and friends. The food is excellent with a wide variety of fish selections and pasta dishes.  We enjoyed our experience and will be back for the great seafood!"}
{"text":"Horrible place for steak..
 I ordered a medium rare steak and they brought back medium well steak that was dry. The manager said it was rare and was not going to cook another steak. He took the entire plate away and charged me...  i let him know i  will pay for the coke and side of lobster that i ordered but not the steak dinner plate. He threatened to call the police if i didn't pay for the plate that i didnt eat and that was removed for my table. I said call the police, then he decided to remove the cost... unbelievable ~ trying to charge for something i never ate..

Corey M - I paid for what i ate, so i didnt skip out on the tab... The manager wanted to charge an additional $39 for the dry steak that I didnt eat and that was also removed from my table... Took entire plate: steak, mash potatoes, vegies. The Restaurant must be hurting for money when they charge a customer for not liking a dry steak and charge for something that was removed for the table."}
{"text":"Tried a bowl to go of their New England clam chowder last week. I was surprised when I looked in the bag when paying that their bowl was only an 8oz cup and was still over $10! I asked the host to double check it wasn't accidentally a cup to go and the manager showed me the comparative cup would have only been a 5-6 oz cup. Wow. Thought would have been a pint at least! Upon trying at home, the broth had great flavor, but there was only one 1/2 inch square of clam meat followed by maybe 3 pencil eraser Campbell's chicken noodle soup chicken sized pieces of clam. Whole total clam meat couldn't have been 1 sq inch! Hey, at least there were two empty clam shells in there, but you can't eat those!  Save yourself the disappointment and do to order their soups to go. Maybe better eaten at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. Good service. Had the lobster mac and cheese.  Lobster was sour. That to me means not fresh. I could be wrong but it wasn't my favorite. 

My wife had the King. Nothing to write home about either
Bottom line, nice place, nice atmosphere. Food needs help."}
{"text":"Wow! A truly excellent meal. We all had the steamed pots and one had the surf and turf burger. Everything was DELICIOUS, and cooked to perfection. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess and had excellent service from our waiter. One of the owners also came out to see how everything was. Our daughter has celiac disease and the staff was educated & eager to assist with safe choices for her. The atmosphere was trendy, yet comfortable. Our family of 4 truly enjoyed our meal and will definitely be back. A true 5-star experience!!"}
{"text":"Oysters on the half shell have become one of my favorite things as of late... They do not disappoint and the size of these babies are magnificent!!! The gumbo was divine and the shrimp pot was amazing.. 4 out of 5 mostly for price... A bit up there for what you get"}
{"text":"High Tide Seafood Bar & Grill is a refreshing find. We went for the first time tonight, on Valentine's Day, without a reservation. We went early in hopes we could possibly sit out on the patio. They told us it would be a 30-35 minute wait if we'd like to sit inside but they called for us in just 5 minutes. We were given one of the best tables in the restaurant and they gave me a long stemmed rose for Valentine's day, both of which made for a wonderful night!

Service: was awesome though we couldn't convince the runner to provide 3 rolls when we had 3 at our table (he was bringing 2 at a time). Was kind of funny to us though ;)  Everyone we interacted with was very nice. Our server was Ryan and he was great.

The menu was unusual in that they want to be known for their steampots, but they also have everything from chicken wings and buttermilk fried chicken, to burgers and BBQ, oysters, fish and mussels. I think the eclectic menu works though.

Food: we got the Cajun shrimp boil to share as appetizer. While it was very tasty, the shrimp had been overcooked. 

My husband ordered \"The King\" steampot and he raved about it. He also had a Bloody Mary which was rimmed with both Old Bay and an additional hotter seasoning, he loved it. He ordered the Caesar side salad and it really was huge, not at all a normal side salad. He's ready to go back as he found all the items he tried to be delicious.

Our daughter ordered a burger off the kids menu and was thankful she had when she saw the enormous burgers from the dinner menu. She said her burger was very good. Though she's a teenager there's no way she would be able to eat  a burger off the main menu.

I was hoping to order king crab and an individual side, but they said market rate was $29 for half lb and $40 for a full lb. Since we recently had fantastic king crab at a different restaurant locally, and they only charged $24 for a lb, I felt High Tide was charging too much. So instead I ordered the Louisiana Gumbo with dirty rice. 

While the gumbo had very good flavor, and had a good amount of shrimp and okra, I was disappointed in the lack of sausage and crawfish. The kitchen dices up the sausage and really ruins it by doing so. I found 3 little pieces of sausage, not even enough to fill a teaspoon, which was really a shame. Crawfish tends to be small anyway but there was little of it as well. There was too much of the beans and rice. Since the beans were pureed (or so it seems), it was very noticeable of the lack of sausage and crawfish.

Over all it was great, we'll likely go again, the service was terrific. Our bill for the night was about $100 with tip."}
{"text":"Interesting saga... After we went here for the first time and had an amazing experience, we went back for a special occasion with family and friends -- and did not enjoy it.  There was a swordfish special, and even though I warned the server that most places overcook swordfish, we let him talk us into it, and two of us ordered it.  Sadly, they didn't excel, and being foodies we could tell the swordfish was overcooked as soon as it was put in front of us.  BUT, the true measure of a restaurant is what they do when things are wrong... the server came by to insist we give our opinion on the food (especially because I commented on how often swordfish is overcooked). When I was forced to admit it was overcooked, they immediately removed it, comped our meals, etc.etc,, all the things a good restaurant does. Still, we did not enjoy the evening, because two of our meals were not edible, the lobster mac and cheese was average, and we were just disappointed over-all....

Last night my 15 year-old daughter and I decided to give it \"one more try\".  Oh my, are we so happy we did.  We sat at the bar, and Dan behind the bar was perfect -- didn't hover and chat us up, but was on-the-spot with anything we needed.  The roving staff made sure nothing got missed, our dirty dishes were cleared promptly and even the staff delivering food would correctly ask if there was anything they could do for us and actually WAIT for us to respond before they'd leave.  

MOST OF ALL... Food was outstanding. Oysters were great and shucked properly . Tasted delicious. We could distinguish the nuanced flavor of each oyster type. They don't dump all the seawater, which any true oyster-lover requires.  

For the entree we ordered the scallop+polenta dish, and it was outstanding. The scallops were a touch over-carmelized but still succulent, and the polenta was 100% perfect. Seriously. We are still talking about the polenta.  The pistachios  on top were the perfect balance, a surprising mix of sweetness and nuttiness with the creaminess of the polenta. Dish had an awesome mouth-feel, we could distinguish each morsel, but it was still creamy with great flavor. Truly amazing.  Plus, we noted that it was served in the middle of a really busy night. We were really impressed.

The only (I'm kidding) negative about High Tide is they have nailed dessert every time I've been there.  The menu is short, but for good reason: it's amazing.  Get the bread pudding...  You're welcome.  Always get the chef selection, last night it was a chocolate torte, and it had an amazing crust on it."}
{"text":"Quality seafood with great beers on tap. This week is restaurant week and they are offering a generous 3 course meal for $30! May 17-26. The service was pleasant."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise...A great seafood restaurant in a Gilbert Strip Mall.  The food is fantastic, the prices were excellent for the quantity and quality of food, and the ambiance is nice.  Lucky for us, we arrived at 5:30.....Just in time for happy hour ($2.00 of drinks and most appetizers 1/2 off).  My husband ordered an Oyster Bloody Mary to drink.  It was seasoned perfectly and quite delicious, yeah I had a few sips and stole an oyster.  To eat, we shared the lobster macaroni and calamari appetizers, they were super.   There was so much lobster macaroni  (we ended up taking half the lobster mac home) that we didn't order an entree'.  Instead, we shared a third appetizer, the crab cake (we took 3/4's of this home too) and the lobster bisque.   There were large pieces of lobster in the bisque and it was really good. The crab cake was good and it was nice to have the micro greens as they added a nice peppery seasoning to the crab cake.  That being said, I didn't understand the fried avocado that was served with the crab cake.  We love avocados but that didn't work for us.   I would give this a 4 1/2 stars but the system won't let me.  I would have given 5 stars if service had been a bit better.  We had to ask for water three times and really didn't see our waitress much.  But when she did come around, she was super friendly.  I think the place just may be a bit understaffed as I didn't see many waitresses and happy hour appears to be an extremely busy time.  Here are a few other thoughts: on our second Oyster Bloody Mary, they forgot the oyster, olive, and lime for the drink and we didn't see our waitress for a while to rectify this before 1/2 of our drink was gone.  The lobster mac, while amazing, was just a smidge oily.  I found a small shell in the lobster bisque and our oyster in the bloody mary had a bit of sand on it.   All that being said, High Tide isn't a super stuffy fine dining restaurant, it is a fun place with fresh, great food.  I am looking forward to going back and trying other items."}
{"text":"Dinner was ok. The pan seared halibut was great! The mac and cheese was ok. The crab legs were some of the worst I ever had. Not one single piece of meat was able to be pulled out in one piece, and the meat didn't even come close to filling the shell it was in. It was very strange. I'll stop by again and try a steampot."}
{"text":"Can't do 5 stars. The food really was fantastic, melt in your mouth good, but very expensive. Very disappointed with the lack of seating to accommodate a wheel chair, we waited a VERY long time on a VERY SLOW week night for apparently the ONLY table you can seat a wheel chair at with 6 other adults. The service was great. The food was great. I had the Sea Bass and almost licked the plate. Everyone liked what they had except the Spicy Seafood Pasta- yes it says spicy, but it was over the top. Couldn't even taste anything else. Can't say we would spend that kind of money again, but i dont mind recommending when someone is looking for a nice seafood spot."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on May 15th 2018 and had a terrible experience with the night manager. My wife ordered Filet steak which she has enjoyed on previous occasions. She wanted it cooked medium well which normally comes pink inside. Our waitress was terrific and when she asked, \"how are meal was?\" my wife show her that it was over cooked to the point that it was tough and burnt. She went together the manager and agreed that it was over cooked. He said, he would discuss with the owner and cook and get back to us. He thought we should get a free desert???? I can't imagine a stupid desert when we needed to get a steak that was editable. We never saw him after that and I am going to write the owner about this idiot. This guy should not even work at a McDonalds. Steak cost $35 and he suggested a free desert which we never received. That is our last meal there until management responds."}
{"text":"Everything is spot on except no sweet tea. Has to be one of the best places in that area. The steam pots come to your table smoking hot and delicious."}
{"text":"This place has really good seafood. It's so fresh and I hear they fly it in fresh daily. It is a bit pricy, but for what you get it's worth it. They also have happy hour which is nice and their drinks are great here too."}
{"text":"I understand there's not exactly an abundance of seafood options in Arizona but the fact that there was an hour wait for this place is still making me laugh a week later.  

There was some good here but there are some terrible flaws.  For one, the \"bar\" is actually part of the kitchen so nearly all of the seats need to be served by waiters, not bartenders.  That sounds fine but in reality you're looking over your shoulder constantly trying to get a drink or order.  I figured that'd be better than waiting for a typical table but I soon learned you wait either way.  After about 10 minutes of waiting we were able to place an order for an appetizer and some drinks.  20 minutes later the appetizer came and, though we were ready to order, we were not given that opportunity.  Also, still no drinks.  The food was ok...$3 an oyster but fine. About 20 more minutes went by before anyone finally came around.  Instead of ordering, we just got the check.  I didn't feel like spending 4 hours on dinner.  When the check came, it included the drinks and the server seemed confused that we never received them.  I was confused why there still was a line at the door.  

The Chinese place next door ended up seating us and feeding us quickly.  If your meal is spoiled at High Tide, they'll take care of you!"}
{"text":"Their calamari is very meaty and crunchy!  Also the lobster mac n cheese is really tasty. I didn't care for the fish and chips were just okay."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great service.  My only suggestion would be to enhance the menu a little otherwise, great food.  Cold beer on tap, modern decor.  Another great place to enjoy happy hour or dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour.  $4 house wines and well cocktails. I came specifically for the famous fried chicken (which is so good) but opted for happy hour chicken wings which they should rename \"monster wings\",  they are Huge and very tasty and crispy.  

Hope come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been here multiple times and believe that is WONDERFUL!! The steam pots are amazing, the drink prices are great and sitting at the bar to watch them make the food is amazing as well.  I will say that you have to put this on the same level as Pappadeaux as there isn't one \"steam crab pot\" on the menu, this place is more upscale food with really relaxed seating and personnel.  We recently went and it was disappointing in the pricing of the crab legs (over $50) for a pound, when you can probably go to Angry Crab and get them cheaper, however their seafood is extremely fresh so it was worth the extra funds.  I recommend anyone that love seafood to eat here!  

If you don't love seafood - The WINGS are the best I've had in the west valley! Dry rub - absolutely amazing"}
{"text":"Tide Roast, calamari, sweet potato fries, and red beans and rice all excellent. Food came out hot and cooked just right. Good service. Next time we will go for happy hour, weekends also!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent service and the mussels appetizer rocked ! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience! All meals are under $20 per person. Sit at the bar, Roger is welcoming and informative. Happy hour shouldn't be missed. Everyday 3-6:30"}
{"text":"Was able to visit with family again and this establishment is a place where you can see how they care about their food and the way the customer is treated.  So far in the east valley it's Hightide and DC Steakhouse who both come out on top.  And I'm super picky!"}
{"text":"I'm here enjoying very good seafood , lobster mac was great but I do have to give them a knock for the owners friend (so he says )on the patio that speaks loud and talks like a trucker . I have to say it really ruined the mood so we called it an early night"}
{"text":"Over-rated.   I was not impressed with much of what I experienced here.  Rather overpriced as well, with mediocre service.   I know that fish overall is spendy for a multitude of reasons, but at these prices, you better be knocking it outta the park on the rest of the food as well, and you unfortunately were tagged out at first base."}
{"text":"Well...after trying to get in at the angry crab in dirty Mesa we stumbled upon high tide and boy were we lucky to do so...

Walked in and sat in the bar area at a high top for 4. There were just 2 of us...

We were immediately greeted by the bartender/waiter and he was great. He was one of those waiters who didn't need to write things down or look at the menu to reference something. The place was hoping but still at the noise lever where you could hear one another. 

We each had a soup to start and shared a entree. There entree portions are definitely worth the price. They are built for 2 and the great waiter informed us of that. 

I had the lobster bisque and she had New England (white) clam chowder. It even had a fresh cooked clam of the half shell floating on top. Very elegant touch. 

For the entree we shared fish and chips but instead of some dirty white fish we had shrimp. Fried oysters was the other option. 

The batter was light and the fries was a mixture of sweet potatoes and traditional. A very nice touch. The most important thing was there was not a hint of grease on the plate. 

At high tide you get what you pay for. We walked out of there with a tab less then 50 and we each had a beer. 

I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Bright, open and spacious. Overall pretty nice. Its not Dennys but not the four seasons either. It is modern and kind of upscale compared to fast casual but not fancy or a white tablecloth joint. While I saw people there who looked to be on dates there were also plenty of people wearing shorts with sandals. 

Service: Our waitress was excellent. She was very attentive. our drink glasses never went below half full.

Food: It was very  good but not great. Let's be honest there are not very many nice seafood restaurants in the valley. This one has food a step above Red Lobster but not anything out of this world.

Value: When the quality of the food is compared with the price charged it is a little bit overpriced. $120 dollars for dinner for 3 people is not a bargain or a great deal but I didn't feel cheated.

I would (will) go back."}
{"text":"Seating and decor was nice. They had a lot of interesting things on the menu so we just ordered a bunch of different apps to try them out and really enjoyed everything. All tasted so fresh and service was great. We will come back."}
{"text":"I came here tonight (Saturday) for a super late lunch/early dinner with my husband and our seafood-loving 6 year old son. It's a darn good thing we came so early because the place was pretty much booked solid with reservations for a tiny bit later in the evening. We also made it in time for their \"crabby\" hour, so we got to try a few things at a reduced price. 

My husband was starving, so he started out with an amazingly delicious cup of Lobster Bisque and some of the best calamari we've had. We always get calamari when it's in the menu and this did not disappoint. The sauces were spot on and my son found a new favorite food. 

For the main course my husband had the surf and turf burger with fries, I had the Tide Roast, and my son had the kids shrimp. Everything was really delicious. The amount of seafood served was really impressive and everything tasted super fresh. There was not even a hint of fishiness in any of our food.  We will definitely be back to try a few other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"The place is fantastic, lives up to the hype.  Great atmosphere, food and service.  Best seafood in the east valley by far.  My wife took me here for my birthday from a recommendation of friends, and it was well worth it."}
{"text":"I almost hate seeing all the great reviews because I LOVE this place and selfishly don't want tons of people to find out about it. 

I've been twice- once for dinner and one for happy hour. Each time I've sat at the bar and had EXCELLENT service. The food is so fresh and I was told the seafood is flown in daily. They will customize the dishes if you want to sub something. 

The lobster Mac & Cheese- oh my goodness! The portion is huge and it reheats well. Just be sure to add in an extra trip to the gym! 

They have a nice selection of wines and cocktails and also non-seafood meal options if you're not a fan of it. Prices are to be expected- considering we're in the desert and not next to the ocean.

The bar tender mentioned they have a Bloody Mary bar on Sunday mornings that you can specialize to your personal preferences. 

To sum it up- just go there and order anything- you can't go wrong. And, just like me, you'll want to keep it all to yourself, too!"}
{"text":"Wow. We went there for my daughter's birthday - she's 5.  We chose a quiet time and the staff took care of us. They treated us special and the food was incredible. I'd go back in a minute."}
{"text":"I heard that one of my favorite local bands was going to be there; Chuckie baby and the All stars\", so we decided to go and see what this B&G was all about...We received a coupon for a free order of Calamari when we walked thru the door!  AWESOME!  We found a seat and perused the menu...I ordered a Mr. Pineapple beer and my husband ordered something else - can't remember.  We placed the order for the calamari and the waiter came back for our dinner order.  I ordered crap cake and my husband ordered...Fish and chips ( i remember now).  When they brought the calamari and the dipping sauces I was pleasantly surprised to see the portion size was actually big enough for two!  When they brought the dinners my husbands fish and chips portion was enormous!  Enough for 2 all by itself!  However...my crap cakes...disappointing.  First they were very mushy and didn't have ANY chunks of crab in them and it really tasted more like a tuna patty rather than crab and it was small!  I mean if I'm going to pay $12 for something I would hope it would be worth it in both proportion and flavor...
So, although I gave this 4 stars it was more because of the service and my husbands fish n chips.  If I based it solely on my crab cake it would definately get 1 star.  
OH...and the band?  FABULOUS as always!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here since moving here almost 2 years ago. We've had great food experience until tonight. Decided to venture out of our typical HT Tide Roast, gumbo, cioppino, and other steam pot dishes. Tonight I tried the Barramundi sea bass. I had high hopes just because we have never been disappointed with anything we've ordered in the past. Unfortunately, the dish, in my opinion should have been called Crab Crusted Barramundi Sea Bass drenched in bottled chili sauce straight from the Asian store! I seriously was disappointed. But my kids both enjoyed their fish and chips and fried okra. It'll be a long while until we return to HighTide. Tonight's dinner just turned me off."}
{"text":"Tried this place while waiting for my iPhone to get fixed. Holy moly! Awesome food! We had the lobster bisque and calamari and I can definitely say that it was one of the best lunches I have had in a long time! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I know there are really good seafood restaurants in the desert, this just isn't one of them. With a few minor tweaks, I think it would be a great one.  The fresh seafood selection on the menu left a lot to be desired.  Fresh fish and seafood can be flown in on Fridays for a great week-end menu.

We started off with an appetizer of calamari. When it came I thought we had gotten someone's cheese sticks instead!! I have never seen calamari in stick form before. I am use to O shaped and the tentacles. When we questioned this, our waiter informed us this was a California thing and slicing the calamari in sticks makes it tender and never tough. I didn't think it tasted like calamari.

It seems the restaurant focus is on their \"steamed\" pots. I requested the light saffron cream sauce for my seafood pasta. It was tasty but way too much sauce. If they had added maybe 2 more servings of pasta it might have been ok. A little bit of sauce with seafood goes along way. The sauce should enhance the seafood NOT cover it up!!

My husband had the king crab legs, broccolini, and fries with sea salt. First the crab: the drawn butter (kudos for using unsalted) was served in a small non warming dish. Anyone who has eaten steamed crab legs know they cool off fast!! Using a warming dish to keep the butter warm helps to warm the crab up also!!! 

Having an up charge for side dishes is on the bold side. Especially, if you pay $4 for an order of frozen french fries!! If you have a FRESH seafood restaurant, shouldn't the rest of your food be fresh!!!

With the prices they charge the food should be spot on!!

We asked our waiter about the owner's and found they are from the mid-west and the chef is from Minnesota and knows a lot about seafood (I found that funny)"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go on special occasions! Amazing food every time, even if you are looking for a unique item or have a special request! I always bring friends and family here when they are in town!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to High Tide since the day it opened. Never thought a low end clothing store could turn into such an amazing seafood restaurant in Gilbert! Fresh oysters, always! Their steam pots are outstanding, the shrimp boil in its broth is a must! I just wish they had a few selections of hot Crab and lobster dishes, not just chilled. As for the service it is always on point!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and the food and service is always great.   I can't figure out why they aren't busier.   Drinking a bloody mary today after some shopping and tastes fabulous.  Highly recommend,  can't go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"So happy I tried this place! My boyfriend and I were looking for good food and drinks on a Saturday morning and were more than pleased. I had the surf and turf burger with sweet potato fries and he had the salmon fillet burger with okra. Both were so good we swapped half of each dish so we could both enjoy them. We also tried out the Bloody Mary bar which was packed with spices, veggies and sauces. Our bartender was Summer who was not only a sweetheart, she also gave us great recommendations and honest feedback about which dishes she enjoyed. Thank you for the great service and quality food. We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and excellent. Managers and staff are always friendly and always striving to make sure they are giving you excellent service."}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious!!! The decor is very well done and the service is friendly and attentive. We love this place."}
{"text":"the place has to be pretty new because they had the store manager walking around and greeting all the diners.  I'll say that the food (red snapper and salmon) was delicious, but I think the place is criminally understaffed, because it took 10 minutes for each of the draft beers that I ordered to make their way to the table; it was also a 30 minute wait for our food to be prepared.  this was a random Tuesday night mind, I'd hate to see what happens on a Friday or Saturday dinner rush.  the menu actually seems oddly bereft of seafood options; outside of oysters and the hot pots they have a shrimp cocktail and a salmon blt and the catch of the day.  overall not bad, but far from amazing."}
{"text":"Ok, @Chris K. what the heck are you talking about with seafood at half the price.... of what?  My entree was 29, so are you used to eating at seafood restaurants where the main entree is 58?  

This was my family's first time here and we all had ok dishes.  I ate the seared tuna which was just ok.  I tried to love it but really it was just average.  My wife had a full pound of crab legs.  There was some confusion about the legs, when we first sat down we saw a few claws mixed in with the legs and we got all legs.  We assumed that we would also get a claw because we specifically asked for the same exact dish that they were eating.  In the end the manager granted our wish and they brought out a claw.  

My kids didn't like the mac and cheese.  We didn't either.  hmmm what else?  I guess for a meal that I thought would cost about 50-60 based on Chris K's rockin' half off price review in the end our bill was 136 with tip.  I've never spent 270 at a seafood restaurant.  I've spent that much at Ruth's Chris but not at a seafood restaurant.  

Last thing, our waiter was so funny, I joked that,\"I'm guessing this is all flown in and not local seafood\" and she said, \"Oh yes, it's all flown in.\"   Face slap...."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood & service (Sara A.) as usual, the only detraction is the patio could use a good steam cleaning. It's Crabby Hour and we shared Ceviche, steamed mussels and beet & spinach salad and enjoyed a NW Rose & a Bell's two hearted ale with it. Highly recommend and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing soup, and service! Get the lobster bisque, it's awesome! Nice and clean, friendly staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had one of our best dining experience eating at this restaurant. I had the orange roughey with risotto and grilled asparagus. It was fantastic. Our son had their fish and chips he had the fried shrimp the batting was light, non greasy delicious.  My husband had  jambalaya which he said was the best he has ever had..W shared a crab cake  which is 3 types of crab omg better than any crab cakes I've waitress  had on thw east coast.Our waitress Debra was so wonderful and helpful. Gilbert has a  wonderful gem of a restaurant we'll be back"}
{"text":"A little late posting this.  My parents and I visited this place on May 19th.   We got there quite earlier than our reservation so we sat at the bar and had a few drinks.  Talked with the staff and some guests.   When we were  seated we were introduced to our server, Danny!  He was AMAZING.  He provided excellent food suggestions and we LOVED everything.  The food here is beyond excellent!!!  I know we'll all be back.  In fact, I'd offered to get my parents a gift card to either the Salt Cellar or here at High Tide for their 25 anniversary this fall and they both, without hesitation said High Tide!!  Well done Danny and the rest of the excellent staff!!! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Just love this place.  It's fun to sit at the bar and watch them cook.  The steam pots are great!"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful atmosphere. We usually sit at the bar so we can watch the steam pots being prepared. It's really cool to watch! Everything about this place is very well done. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The fresh calamari steak strips were the best. The Stock pot high tide just melted in my mouth it was so good.  My wife had jumbo shrimp platter and she loved it. We will be back soon"}
{"text":"This place surprised me, I've lived within three miles of it for 5 years and traveled to Scottsdale for all of my seafood. Though there may be better seafood elsewhere, you can't beat the seafood and value of this place. I had their BluePoints, and they were excellent. Additionally, I recommend their sea bass. I was very pleased with our overall experience. Great food, decent price. Good location for the east valley."}
{"text":"There's not many places in the valley to get fresh and tasty seafood, but here it is. You walk in, greeted with a smile, and notice the big pile of ice with fresh huge crab legs beautifully placed in it. Easily some of the best clam chowder that has ever passed my lips! I even have to fish clamshells out! The lobster bisque is good too. Fish and Chips is average. Kid loves the lobster Mac n cheese. The Louisiana Gumbo is super tasty. I've also ordered the King, and was very satisfied. The calamari is another winner. Always have had very good service."}
{"text":"Checked this place out since it seemed to be new. Boy oh boy is this a good place! The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I don't believe it is as good as Ocean Trail at the casino. But saying that, this place has a bunch of other items on their menu that are amazing!
In particular the Lobster mac and cheese is basically a meal in and of itself. The 'pot-roast' style of food isn't too shabby either, but this is where they are lacking compared to the other place I mentioned. The other seafood appeared fresh as I had the cioppino and it was pretty good. 
Overall I'd give this place a try if you like seafood and are stuck out here in the desert like the rest of us."}
{"text":"Dinner Resv for 8 people served with slow service and frustration for $321 + obligatory tips = $410.24 and an addition to our black list.

Appetizers took about 30 minutes to show up and shortly before the entres were served.

A/C was weak and we were hot.  Not a good sign when eating seafood in the desert.

Water refills were slow.

Cloth napkins that had a funky odor.  That happens but when asked for paper napkins, they choose to provide a few cocktail napkins.  After repeated request for regular napkins, their offer for paper towels, we finally get real napkins.

A manager who idealizes the dictionary definition of condescension and actually managed to make a mediocre dining experience horrible."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place (I live kind of far from this area), but a friend suggested we come here for Sunday brunch. The \"regular\" lunch & dinner menu looks yummy here (the friend who suggested we come here confirms that it is) so I'll need to come back and try it!

Anyway, this place does a pretty delicious/awesome Sunday football brunch (they have several TV's, and from what I could tell they show a different NFL game on each TV). They have an unlimited omelette bar, which includes sausage, bacon, potatoes, and fruit for $14. This is what I got and it was yummy. It's pretty typical omelette ingredient selections, but there was also shrimp & and andoullie sausage. In addition to the omelette bar they have chicken & waffles. One person in our group got this and said it was very good. The portion was huge. They also do a different special each Sunday. The day we were here it was a breakfast sandwich w/salmon, avocado & bacon. It includes a side. A person in our group got this and enjoyed it. Again, the portion is huge (he got sweet potato fries as his side).

Of course being brunch we were interested in adult breakfast beverages. I'm not much of a Bloody Mary drinker, but I was more than okay w/the $4 mimosas. If you do like BM's they do a bar w/TONS of options. The also put a large shrimp (amongst other snacks) in all there Bloody Marys. I had one from a friend's BM who didn't want hers and it was delicious. 

I'll be back here for brunch and will definitely check it out for lunch or dinner (they also do Happy Hour)."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile. Figured we give it a try again.  Needless to say extremely disappointed!!! Although food wasn't bad, we waited 45 minutes for crab cake and  fish and chips .... did I mention that they totally forgot our steamed clams yep they did !! Server had half the bar and at least 10 tables. We watched people who came in after us get served first, someone from kitchen bringing out food to wrong tables and when we got our food and told them they forgot our clams manager finally came to table to say they didn't expect the rush. Can understand stand that but when your that busy and your waiter can't handle it as the manager you should pick up the slack. I personally watched him do nothing. Very sad considering I worked in the restaurant business for years."}
{"text":"I would have liked to see more variety on the menu. My wife and I started with the calamari which could have been a meal for one as large as the portion was. It was hands down the best calamari I've had in Phoenix, however, it would have been nice to have a second dipping option to go with the large portion.

For the main dish I ordered the Alaskan Cod fish and chips and my wife ordered 'The King'. Having recently eaten the same dish in Seattle I was hoping this would compare and unfortunately it didn't.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but no more memorable than any other restaurant that serves fish and chips. My wife's dish however was fantastic, she wouldn't share any of her king crab, but I was able to sneak several bites of everything else. The sauce everything was bathed in was the perfect compliment for the various different kinds of seafood in the bowl. 

I'll probably try the gumbo next go around!"}
{"text":"Awesome seafood and really great service from the waitstaff. The crabcake my husband and I enjoyed as an appetizer was SPOT ON. Just awesome! Everything we ate was exceptional. 

Interior wise, I think the ambiance is lacking a bit and feels significantly like a bar. This place is so amazing that if the inside had a higher class feel, I think it would really step it up a notch. I wouldn't go here for a business dinner because of the seating situation and set up, but it's great for a family meal or if you're looking for a more casual experience. We're looking forward to eating here again soon!"}
{"text":"This is the place for people (like me) who have high standards for seafood.  I won't go near chain places like Red Lobster or Joe's Crab Shack, because I am so done with paying good money for bad service, loud environment and food poisoning.  (More than once)   

High Tide has everything I like.  Relaxing, calm atmosphere, well-designed layout, servers are reasonable and attentive, no signs of that fake perkiness that passes for customer service these days.  The food...oh, the food.  I had given up on having fresh seafood in the desert, limiting myself to brief forays to the coast.  Now I can indulge myself without having to endure a TSA checkpoint.  The High Tide combo is my favorite, because I can never pick just one thing - crab, oysters, mussels, clams, shrimp - I can have it all!

There are a couple of minor points that keep me from granting the 5 stars.  (I warned you I was picky.)  One - it would be helpful to make the menu a little more allergy friendly.   I have auto-immune issues, eating fresh shellfish helps to get much needed trace minerals into my body, plus oysters and mussels are great for inflammation.  When they are combined with things that do trigger my inflammation like gluten, it cancels out the benefits.  Two, please consider adding a hot towel & lemon service to your menu.  I don't mind paying a few bucks so I don't have to run to the bathroom with crab junk all over my hands.  It's icky to have to do that.

I love the creme brulee, it's fantastic, but I wish there was a gluten-free chocolate dessert option.   I know, insanely picky customer wants the world here.  It's because you're that good....and well, my birthday is coming up.   No singing, no fuss, just a small slice of gluten free chocolate cake would be heavenly.   Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming! Disappointing service!

We arrived to celebrate Father's Day and requested to be seated at the booth. Everything was perfectly fine from hostess stand point. 

Ryan, our server showed lack of enthusiasm to serve us. We had to ask what the special was, asked for more water, etc. He only once checked on how we were doing, it was when our meal was almost done with. What's the point? We had to ask for water refills etc. I've never experienced such low service. The meal was decent but the service was horrendous. We won't be returning!

Don't bother!!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner, seafood gumbo and the salmon special, fresh, tasty, very well cooked, excellent service, great atmosphere.  Nothing wrong here!  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I felt like I was at a lively shoreline restaurant because of the fresh decor and upbeat music. It's a nice, welcoming spot and a great alternative to typical Gilbert restaurants. During the day it's a family spot and in the evening, the lighting transforms this place to the perfect date night destination.

Food: The food service was slow but worth the wait. The calamari was thicker than I prefer but my husband loved it but we were both in love with their clam chowder! It was rich and had tons of fresh clams. The lobster Mac n cheese and the tide roast lacked dimension but still good.

I just wish they served the food at a higher temp. Everything was lukewarm but the kids' meal fries. Also would prefer different bread options. Their sour dough is really sour. I would also extend the non-alcoholic drink and desert menu. Just soda, tea, and lemonade. But if you are drinker, then you'll be in heaven.

Overall great!"}
{"text":"There was a bit of a mix up on our Valentine's night reservation,  but the manager gracefully corrected it.  I had the \"The King\" and it was fabulous!  Full of seafood and delight!  Our waitress was friendly,  attentive and the atmosphere unique and pleasant.   We are from the Midwest and come to this area several times a year... will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Best seafood in the East Valley! The steam pots are all very good and you can add spice which is a bonus! Service has been topnotch and the ambience is very nautical and well done. The open kitchen/bar is so awesome, you can actually see them preparing your meal! On my birthday the place a card on the table so the server knew and o was presented with options for desert! I  chose the bread pudding and loved it!"}
{"text":"Delicious Happy Hour choices, unbelievably fresh oysters that are so tasty! Trust me when I say, you might overhear the story being told by the manager of how freshly flown in they really are, He is a proud owner and with that, 5 stars because it's a job well done! Wish we lived closer, and when I'm no longer pregnant I will go back for cocktails and oysters half shell and add photos!!"}
{"text":"It's an awesome place with great ambiance. They have a really good happy hour but all of their food is very good. On the weekends they have Bloody Mary bar"}
{"text":"We had been feeling a little hesitant to come in because seafood can go so horribly wrong. We finally went in today and delicious!!! The atmosphere was clean and relaxing. The food was yum. I had one of the steamer bowls with a white wine broth and it was magical. We also did the sausage and cheese plate and the bread pudding. Everything we had was fresh and beautiful. We will now be regulars. Just go already!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST seafood restaurant in the east valley!! Amazing!!

We had the Tide Roast and the Gumbo, my father ate everything on his plate and he is a very picky eater!! 

We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Gumbo was bad, inedible, so I pushed it away. Ended up eating my mums food. Once I was full on her food, they noticed. Attempts were made to bring me different food or a desert but alas I was full on my mums food.  Paid full price for that lesson. Fish and chips were good."}
{"text":"This is a top notch seafood restaurant. Everything I have ever ordered is cooked to perfection. We have been here several times and are never disappointed. There halibut is one of the best I have ever had. The fish is always fresh. You must try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here half a dozen times so far and each visit has been memorable and delicious!!! We are from the East coast and it can be hard to find really good seafood in Az.  Husband enjoys seafood a lot and so when we discovered HT I was so excited for him. He had loved everything from pieces of fish, the pots, and the bisque!! And for me (I don't like fish) and I am obsessed with both chicken dishes and the risotto!!!!! The fried chicken is one-of-a kind amazing and the grilled chicken has a special cream sauce and the risotto has made appearances in my dreams!! This is a must-go!"}
{"text":"The word \"wow\" doesn't begin to explain how great High Tide is. We showed up at close and not only did the owner welcome us but the staff treated us like celebrities. 

The food was nothing short of exceptional. We had the cioppino and I would recommend it to anyone.  We will definitely be back to adorn this local business. Please check out High Tide and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We dine regularly here and  enjoy the very fresh seafood.  The staff is wonderful as well.
Fresh oysters, shrimp, and great fish entrees. Always a very good experience!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  I went their to celebrate my birthday! Such an awesome atmosphere, but the food was even better. Our waiter was knowledgable and helpful when suggesting menu options.  I had the gumbo! It was the best gumbo I had since my time in South Carolina.  I will definitely come back here. This place is my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome food as usual.  Sat me and family of four immediately. Get the ceviche special snd key lime dessert. It's very good."}
{"text":"This place is a must stop if you're in Gilbert.  Everything was outstanding. 

The server was very helpful when we mentioned it was our first visit.  He went as far as even brought us a sample of the lobster bisque to see what we thought. And it was freaking outstanding.  Extremely rich as it had bits of lobster in it, but wow oh so good.   

I ordered the King past dish and my girlfriend ordered the High Tide.  Both were excellent and no complaints.   

It is on the pricey side, but was worth every penny.  We will be going back again and again.  Next time I have my eyes in the lobster mac.  I hear it's uh-mazing!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to High Tide for the first time last night. I read a bunch of Yelp reviews recommending several things so we decided to give it a try. The calamari was in long fried strips and tasted as good as any other I've had at other places. No better no worse. The fresh oysters were as good as it gets if you are not in a restaurant closer to the ocean. However, the thing that made my night was the Gumbo. OMG!  I'm not saying it's the best I've ever had, but it is the best I have had in the last 25 years. The only thing closer was in Louisiana. I am extremely happy with that all by itself. The atmosphere and the wait staff where very good as well."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Can sit at the bar and watch the chefs web their magic!! Delicious ahi tuna sliders.. LOVE their friend chicken with honey.. Very good happy hour prices. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"\"All things must pass,\" in the words of the great George Harrison.  High Tide's food used to be awesome and there was always a wait. Now, they are struggling to fill up on a Friday night. \"The customer is not always right!\" is what the surly manager said as I returned an over salty and petrified, Gordon Ramsey Kitchen Nightmarish piece of fish. Funny--it was sold as a tribute to restaurant week for the price of $44 in a 3 course price fixed menu. Keep in mind, I have spent thousands of dollars there since they opened, and have personally recommended them to dozens of customers who trust my recommendations. The food used to be on point. Up to now, I was a regular-- a loyal and satisfied customer. The food is no longer making Gilbert proud. The manager, clearly  frustrated with declining business, continued his rant after I told him I would not be back, adding rudely, \"oh...like we will be going out of business now.\" The once stellar lobster Mac and cheese was now bland and tasteless--as if filled with immitation crab. The traditionally great calamari, was now rendered limp and soggy. Sad to see the steep decline. Used to busy every night.  Now they lie and tell people there is a long wait, when half the tables are empty. Another one bites the dust! So sad."}
{"text":"Great  atmosphere, first time here.  The service is friendly and inviting. The tide roast is amazing! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is very expensive and the quality is just average. I would have to say they need to sharpen their pencil price wise. I do like the ambiance and the restaurant is very clean and well kept."}
{"text":"This dish was off the hook....I love seafood and I found this place. I will definitely return"}
{"text":"High Tide is a little gem.  Unless you live right next to the ocean, you won't get fresher seafood than at High Tide.  Tonight was my 4th visit since September 2015.  I brought my wife and daughter.  Our server, Summer is the absolute sweetest person you'll ever meet in your life.  She is one of those rare servers who mixes professionalism with sweet Texas charm which melts your heart.

Summary: 
Food quality and choice is excellent.  
Service, excellent.  Atmosphere, open environment, lots of action going on around you, doesn't bother me.  If you request a booth, you can get seating which is a little more cozy and romantic if you want something like this.
Pricing is average for high end seafood.  Expect around $40-$50 per person plus drinks, tax and gratuity."}
{"text":"Very nice interior.  Sounds goofy to review the silverware but I have to.  It is high quality, good looking utensils.  Best fish and chips we have had in this area (since moving here from San Diego a year ago)  Excellent tarter sauce.  The fish and chips comes with peach/cashew slaw.  Different and very good!  The cabbage wasn't grated - it was chopped with a very nice texture.  Nice wait staff.  We'll go back!"}
{"text":"Holy moly! Saffron cream sauce for the King! Beef short ribs made my eyes roll back it was so good! Bread pudding known as \"heaven on a plate\"."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!!!! Excellent service, Excellent food! The fried chicken was out of this world! Mac n cheese was so good, short ribs were amazing!"}
{"text":"We were reluctant to try a new place on my wife's birthday but everything about our first visit was perfect--great food, outstanding cool decor and a knowledgable waiter (Ryan) who clearly loves the restaurant. Best lobster bisque and best mac & cheese ever. Wonderful, meaty gumbo (not too spicy) and tasty cioppino (full of shrimp, oysters & clams). Outstanding bread pudding topped off the meal. We travel to the Gulf every year for our Cajun and seafood fix.  Nice to know there is great seafood in the desert no less!  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best lunch ever!! Thank you Joe for your amazing service!! Can't wait to return and try more things in your amazing menu. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Finally found an outstanding seafood restaurant here in The Valley. Everything was outstanding and the service was great as well. Best Lobster bisque ever. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the pleasure to dine at High Tide last night. I had oysters, and samon for dinner. Oysters were outstanding best I have ever had. If you like oysters you won't find better then this place. Samon, well what can I say, tender moist absolutely delicious.
Wife had calamari it was OK nothing special. Her main dinner was a Mexican flavor seafood dish, very hearty, filling and tasty, but once you tasted the samon nothing could compare. The place says fresh all-over it. Highly recommended. Place was packed on a Thursday and that's why."}
{"text":"Finally a great seafood restaurant in the east valley!  The food is fresh and well prepared. The Cajun Shrimp Boil is one of my favorite appetizers along with their shrimp cocktail and sausage & cheese board. The bread pudding is a MUST.

They also have live music. Chuck E Baby was playing and was awesome as always. Great addition to the overall atmosphere of the restaurant.

Really loved the food and music and will be back!  Gotta love a place that supports live music!!!"}
{"text":"Went on a not busy afternoon, service was prompt.  The food was just average while costing a little above average.  My gumbo was without seasoning, and a lot of pepper didnt help.  Hubbys fish and chips were ok, with bland slaw and a mountain of frozen french fries."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Lived in New Orleans for multiple years and the food here brings me back. Great Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"The food is good. The steam pots are not like others that I've had- they are decent. The appetizers and menu selection are very good. I would recommend their happy hour. Overall, they have good food and service. I love the calamari."}
{"text":"My husband and I have tried too locate different places to eat since we moved to Chandler, AZ...There aren't very many seafood places so we decided to try this place. It was ok...but I grew up in Oregon so  I have a pretty high bar for seafood...I ordered fish & chips and the portion was good.. An ok place if you are craving seafood"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great food and surprisingly cheap prices! Got an order of lobster Mac and cheese, clam chowder and fish and chips. Everything tastes just right. The birthday bread pudding was on the house and it was bomb!"}
{"text":"DON'T BOTHER IF YOU LIKE SEAFOOD!  The wait staff was very nice, the mac'n cheese with lobster we ordered as an appetizer was very good.  My husband ordered the fish and chips and it was ok.  I had the sea bass CRAB CRUSTED BARRAMUNDI SEA BASS, with Yakisoba Noodles, Sweet Chili Sauce & Wok Stir-Fried Vegetables.  The sea bass was way over cooked and a small piece of fish - it was terrible!  I had to cut it with my knife.   It was so bad I took one bite and pushed my plate away.  The crab \"crust\" did not flavor well with the sea bass, which was tough, and the dish was not good.   The dinner was $27 and I felt very overpriced for the taste and the size of the fish.  I was extremely disappointed as I love sea bass and was excited to try this place.  We had the appetizer, which we were supposed to be charged $11 for at \"crabby\" hour, but they charged us the full price of $13, fish and chips (cod) for $19, my sea bass $27 and each an ice tea and it came to around $60 and change.  $19 for cod fish and chips for dinner is too expensive - and my fish wasn't good.  The lobster mac'n cheese was very good, but the lobster in and of itself in the ma'-n cheese was nothing to write home about.  We ended up leaving our waitress a decent tip as she was nice but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at High Tide!!! The seafood was pretty good for it being in Arizona! My wife and I got 2 lobster bisques which were AMAZING, some seafood appetizer thing which had clams, oysters, crab legs, large cocktail shrimps which satisfies your seafood cravings! It was fresh, it wasn't \"too die for\" or anything, but still really good cause it tastes fresh! 

As for entrees, my wife and I got the ahi tuna and the seafood jambalaya! The ahi tuna was alright, still fresh, but just kinda reminded me of a sushi dish, nothing extraordinary about it but nice presentation! The jambalaya was awesome! Great flavor and HUGE portion!!!! Dang I really should have asked for another bowl of rice cause this thing can seriously feed two!

All in all, great service and really fresh seafood for somewhere in Arizona. I can't believe knit pick about stuff because I've only been here once, and I'll probably go again if I'm feeling a need for seafood! I highly recommended this place"}
{"text":"Best Sea Food in Gilbert - not even a question + one of the best bars in the area. Not much to look out on the outside - but a gem inside."}
{"text":"This is by far one of THE BEST restaurants in Gilbert.  We have been there twice now - the first time was so great that we returned only 3 days later.  The ambience is casual, warm and welcoming.  They have a large bar area along with lots of seating in the dining area.  The food and service are outstanding!!  Both times we had the Crab Garlic Cheesy Bread appetizer - so, so good!  The main dishes we ordered both times were expertly prepared and beyond delicious. Kudos to the Chef! Our server Jacob was very attentive, professional and knowledgeable. Also, great cocktail menu and good selection of beer and wine.  Just can't be a better seafood restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!!! I have only rated one other time on Yelp and it was not a great experience. This on the other hand has been well worth it! The service is A+. They let me try 3 different wines before committing. We had wings, which are literally large wings not drumsticks, fish, shrimp, and beignets. We had a 7 year old with us and they have a solid kid's menu. Great ambiance with business class patrons and great happy hour menu. Well worth it! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was first turned on to High Tide by my Lady. She had been raving about this place for some time. However I was never able to get there since I live in North Scottsdale, she lives in Gilbert. I was able to catch a review of the restaurant on the PBS show Check Please Arizona. It was a strong review, so I made it a point to go. 

Fast Forward a few weeks:

I started this adventure with the lobster mac-n-cheese appetizer, it was happy hour, which I shared with my lady. This thing was like a sea monster that Captain Nemo fought off, it was HUGE creamy and yummy. definitely a drop the mic dish. We couldn't finish it, so I took the rest home for diner the next day. 

As my entree I ordered the Fish and Chips. I don't usually order fish and chips so this was a flying fish leap of faith in my ladies suggestion. For me the batter is mostly case much too heavy. However as always my lady was right on with the High Tide Fish-n-Chips, it was a decent serving size and the batter was light,airy and seasoned perfectly. I was stuffed at this point so I took the rest home.

This is a must try restaurant. Tell them Craig sent you, they don't know me but maybe the next time I go so many of you will have mentioned my name that they will give me a free appetizer."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have never been disappointed.  My favorite is the white sea bass and the clam chowder.  I always want to lick my bowl and or plates."}
{"text":"Outstanding experience. Love these types of finds! 

Had been wanting to try and finally came in for my Birthday Dinner. Didn't disappoint. 

Our server was Ari. She was fantastic. Brought us out three samples of sauce from their most popular seafood dishes. Tomato Cream, Gumbo and Saffron Cream. All three were delicious.

I had the steak with a lobster tail. It was good, but would have probably preferred what the others ordered. My husband had the spicy seafood pasta and really thought it was perfection. My son(s) had the scallops which were cooked to perfection. Like butter & so divine. And the Tide Roast -extremely amazing. The tastiest dish of the evening was the steamed black mussels in a beautiful broth. Our daughter ordered the appetizer as her meal. It's a healthy serving! Portions are pleasing for the price.

Side note: They get FRESH seafood in daily from all over the country. Market prices may vary on some dishes. Gorgeous presentation of seafood displayed on ice near the bar. The head chef here has great history in his culinary background and takes pride in his work. Read about him and appreciate his respect for seafood & experience his quality for taste.  

High Tide specializes in a unique steam kettle/ steam pot cooking. Highly recommend their \" Specialty House Steam Pot Meals\". 

Atmosphere and staff professional. 

We had a great time -WHAT A GREAT PLACE!"}
{"text":"I love the food and they have amazing cocktails! Service was ok. I like the high ceiling and decoration inside. The only complaint I have is that the Louisiana Gumbo was too salty. I looked at the previous reviews and people were complaining that it was flavorless and bland. I had to ask for a glass of warm water to dilute out but still could not swallow. Flavor was ok but just too much salt. Otherwise I like the rest of the food."}
{"text":"We went on a date night a couple months ago. Everything we ordered was flavorful and accurate temperature. The food is worth the price. The seafood was fresh! Service was friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! This is the second time I have been to this restaurant while visiting Arizona and I absolutely love it! I'm a huge fan of seafood and living in Wisconsin you have to search out the best places and Arizona being very similar, this is a fantastic place to find seafood. They definitely know what they're doing when it comes to preparing amazing entrées! I love that they have a raw oysters and fresh seafood! And this visit we decided to stop in for lunch. My mom and I shared some raw oysters, ordered the lobster bisque and clam chowder along with ordering two different fish sandwiches so we could split and each try a half. Our friend ordered the Tide Roast and cheeseburger. They offer some amazing side dishes from sweet potato fries to fried okra and Mac and cheese. AND don't forget about the bread pudding it's a MUST TRY!!!! What are you waiting for! Try this place immediately!!!"}
{"text":"Little bit pricey and kind of dark but... Absolutely fantastic food. Very fresh and very clean. Waitress was super friendly. I will definitely come again and I'll recommend it to anyone looking for sea food."}
{"text":"This is the seafood place the East Valley has been waiting for!
Top notch.  Good food.  Excellent service.  Great Happy Hour!  
We had three appetizers and all three were excellent.  The Lobster Mac and Cheese was the best we have had anywhere West of the Mississippi!  Try the HH version if the regular price scares you (although we thought it was well worth the price).  The mussels were great and the Calamari was also the best we have had in Phoenix or California!
I am not going to try to find different adjectives to describe goodness of all of the food that we tried.  We had the Fish and Chips, the Tide Roast Steampot and the Mahi Special.  All of them were spectacular.
The owner was very friendly and the entire staff was attentive yet easy going and personable.
I have never given five stars on Yelp before.  Congratulations High Tide you are my first (I can never say that again!).
We will definitely be back and have already made at least a half dozen recommendations!"}
{"text":"I always have high hopes in finding a good seafood place, but alas this was not the one. We came here on a Sunday with my boyfriends family, the place was not really busy. They were serving an omelet bar for $15, which is not bad, but who wants omelets when you came for the seafood. We ordered a spread of food to share, we got the calamari, lobster Mac n cheese, two full size Kings, and lunch portions of ciopinno and tide roast. The stars were definately calamari and the tide roast. The calamari was golden and crispy, but not overly chewy. The tide roast has some good flavor profiles and the crayfish and clam flavors really come through with the creaminess of the sauce. The crab in the King was good but the overall dish was too salty and distracts from the other flavors. The lobster Mac had a good toasty crumble on top but really lacked in flavor. And lastly my dish the ciopinno was such a complete disappointment that I didn't even try to finish what was over half of it left and donated it to my boyfriends plate. The cod was too overcooked and lacked any flavor or tenderness, the clams and mussels we tender but not really anything to talk about. And the weird pieces of seafood we couldn't identify (it was calamari) was just there for looks I guess. And the broth could have been nothing more than water. It's too bad was really looking forward to finding some good seafood."}
{"text":"A little pricey but the food is great.  Wine is half price on Wednesday.  My favorite dish is the Cioppino steamer bowl."}
{"text":"I've visited High Tide a couple of times and I've enjoyed this place both for its atmosphere and its food. The openness of the restaurant allows you to do a fair amount of people watching. From our vantage point (a high-top near the bar) we were able to see most of the action at the steam pots and horseshoe bar.

The steam pots are a nice twist. It seems somehow a cleaner method of preparing seafood that otherwise might be sautéed in endless amounts of butter or oil. The first time I visited I ordered the Spicy Seafood Pasta, which was delicious. It's chock full of seafood that includes shrimp, halibut, cod, calamari, clams and mussels. The spicy tomato cream sauce is also wonderful, but the amount that my noodles were dressed in was a bit overkill. I think this dish would benefit from more restraint when deciding the optimal sauce-to-noodle ratio, because I had to leave behind quite a bit of the delicious sauce after I finished the dish--because it was simply too much!

On my return visit, I had a willing dining partner who wanted to check out the High Tide Tower. We wanted to stay low-carb, so this was a welcome choice. We also each ordered a 1/2 Caesar salad which was somewhat disappointing. I felt the salads were underdressed and lacking in flavor. We asked for extra Caesar dressing on the side, which seemed to help matters. But I wish that this salad included more Parmesan on it, and maybe anchovies. Flavorwise, it felt more like a green salad than an indulgent, creamy Caesar salad.

The Seafood Tower was quite a feast. Market value pegged the Tower at roughly $90, which we split. Everything was chilled and served on ice, but I still craved warm drawn butter with my lobster and crab legs. Sauce choices included cocktail sauce with fresh horseradish (we asked for extra), a nice champagne-vinegar mignonette, and house hot sauce. The raw oysters were spot on with a blast of the potent fresh horseradish! The mussels were my least favorite part, and they had loaded this platter to the gills with them. It also would have been nice to have some bread to break up this seafood/meat bomb. Nonetheless, it was still a memorable dining experience.

Although I felt there were a couple of missteps, I'll be back to dine here again. The staff was pleasant and friendly, the place feels pretty happenin', and the buttermilk-fried chicken (which is now my buddy's favorite dish here) looks fantastic!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, it is my go to for consistency, good quality and fresh food.  I Have tried a variety of dishes and they have all been great.  I recommend this restaurant to all my friends for great seafood."}
{"text":"The Grand opening of High Tide bar and grill is a welcome addition to Gilbert.  A limited selection of craft beers, some fantastic original mixed drinks, and the steamed pot seafood is prepared to satisfy the most critical pallets. My basic criticism of most seafood restaurants is that they over cook everything, Making the most succulent of foods into rubber. Not so at High Tide."}
{"text":"We were pretty excited when we first went to High Tide because of the recommendations on Yelp! Other than Ryu sushi that sits across the parking lot from High Tide, there isn't much in the way of really good seafood locally. The restaurant looks great and is adorned with high class appointments and a cool raw bar, but that was about where my attraction to High Tide ended. 

The shrimp cocktail that came out clearly was a couple days old. When the shrimp starts to turn brown/grey at the ends, it's best not to serve it. The waitress kept forgetting portions of the order and when the food did come out, it hardly resembled the high cost of the meal. At the end of the day, if you are looking for a high end sea food experience, unfortunately you'll have to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent customer service. You can't beat this place if you love seafood...."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! We love everything on the menu. My favorite is the king pot. Is soooo yummy! And they have a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"I had great expectation.  Friends said only place for seafood in east phx. What a disappointment. One word. Meh.   Had muscles with salty broth overflowing with no spoon or bread. Waiter recommended due to broth. Give me a good pho anytime and take this away."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem! We've lived in Gilbert for 3 years and  just found this awesome seafood place! My husband and I both enjoyed the fillet mignon. I added crab, which was amazing!  My husband really enjoyed the lobster he added. We also started with the lobster mac n cheese- it was HUGE! and delicious!  

The service was incredible,  we made a reservation and were sat as soon as we arrived. 

A new favorite!"}
{"text":"At first my wife and I were hesitant to try because the logo looked amateur...(sad I know, but seafood can be scary).  We gave it a try today and we were blown away!  Gilbert, we have something really special here.  We had the sausage and cheese appetizer to start.  The presentation was sublime and the flavors were better.  We each had a steam bowl entree.  Wow!  I had the High Tide Roast (?)...yum!  The home made hot sauce made the meal.  My wife had the Cioppino.  The broth was so delicious!  We had the bread pudding for dessert...some of the best I've had.  The only downside is my wife burned her finger on the bowl for the bread pudding and she has a big blister now...so be careful!  We can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Crab cakes, Seafood and Bisque Oh my..... I love seafood and I will tell you this place is fresher then places I have eaten right off the Ocean... They have an awesome staff that truly cares about the customers. My wife and I drive miles out of the way each week to eat at this gem. The lobster Bisque is to die for, the Crab cakes are simply perfect, and by simply I mean three different kinds of crab, a little seasoned aioli and that's it! If you want to order one of the steam pots I would suggest the Tide Roast... Seriously so good..."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on Mother's Day without a reservation and they were able to seat us still even though they were mostly reserved . Everything we had was delicious, they have one of the best lobster bisque I've had in Arizona. The service was great and all the staff was very friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be back again to try everything on the menu. AND make sure you try the bread pudding!!!!!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I don't particularly care for seafood. The wife loves it, so we have stopped by High Tide a few times since they have opened, and they did not disappoint. 

Wife loves the steam pots, each one better than the last. Calamari is great, Lobster Mac is to die for even the jambalaya is pretty spot on. 

Love sitting at the bar and checking out the action. Great beer selection and always attentive and friendly service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is by far an amazing restaurant with excellent staff and great food. Highly recommend sea bass and any of the hot pot soups. I have been here a few times and we enjoy the environment and the service from the staff-keep up the great work-looking forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"High Tides is an excellent restaurant with an excellent chef.  My friend ordered the steam pot entrees - Tide Roast and the gumbo which were filled with seafood especially shrimp.  My entrees were a halibut dish and a special sea bass - both were excellent.  The servers were attentive and helpful since I am allergic to some shellfish.  One of the owners was gracious and also wanted to know our opinions.  The happy hour menu of drinks and seafood is an added plus,  High Tides is the best restaurant in our four visits to the Phoenix area for spring training - Go Cubs. The only negative was the reservation system and personnel who are tethered to a time table even when tables are available."}
{"text":"Amazing Food.  Excellent Service.  I look forward to returning here again soon for another date night."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  It is a bit pricey but the hot pots are amazing.  I wouldn't get the fried shrimp but everything else was great!"}
{"text":"So I want to say it was pretty crowded during dinner time but if you take the patio there was immediate seating. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice the hostess was welcoming and I had a wonderful server. But unfortunate the food I ordered wasn't quite was I was expecting. Least what I got was just 3 stars worth. The extra star was just for my wonderful server. So going on. I ordered the cerviche and halibut and chips and my fiance got the fried oysters and chips. So what's wrong. Cerviche should really be called more of a cocktail. Shrimp should have been chopped in pieces and it was obvious cooked but not through lime. Given they at least did not over cook the shrimp. It was ok. But it really wasn't cerviche. Now my fish and chips and the fried oysters. It was pretty over battered. I didn't like it too much plus I felt my halibut was dry. My fiance pretty much peeled off the batter because it was too much. The tartar sauce had horseradish in it which I don't really like. And when ask if they had tartar sauce without it they did not have it. So I pretty much didn't finish my food. The mix of sweet potatoes and regular potatoes fries was a nice mix. Cole slaw was ok.  Needed pepper. Overall I was just disappointed. Maybe they other food options may be done better. But a restaurant should reflect their food best with all their options. So most likely I won't be coming back. Just being fair. Service is great. Food not so much."}
{"text":"So good! Great food, friendly service with just the right amount of attention. We made it in time for lunch AND happy hour: Bonus! 
We ordered the seafood gumbo and the spicy seafood pasta. Both were loaded with seafood and flavor. Fresh. Get a bit of their house hot sauce if you think of it. Happy hour domestic drafts 3.00, craft 4.00, Moscow mules 5.50."}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh and perfectly prepared food.  All of the seafood is amazing and the ShortRibs and Fried Chicken are a home run as well.  Friendly, prompt staff and comfortable atmosphere.  Don't miss out on the Lobster Bisque!!"}
{"text":"I was craving fish & chips and came across this restaurant on yelp. I haven't had any luck finding a great fish & chips restaurant in the valley and was not expecting a lot. I was just hoping for decent food since it is a seafood place. When we arrived at the restaurant we were greeted by a host who even open the door for us. Our waitress was great, friendly and attentive. That was pretty much the positive points which deserved 2 stars. The food was negative, negative, negative. We ordered a High Tide Combo which was a huge plate of rubbery seafood. It included fresh oysters (just ok), crab legs (rubbery), shrimp (over cooked & too firm), clams (just ok) and mussels (tasted funky). None seemed fresh and tasted like it was precooked days in advance and kept refrigerated too long. Fish & chips were soggy and greasy mess, after few bites I was done. The batter on the fish was so thick and was oozing oil. Cole slaw was tasteless and not enough seasoning. Only thing that was edible was the fries. It's hard to go wrong with bloody mary but they botched that too. We learned a $100 lesson and won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"They have great Clam Chowder and the Lobster Mac n Cheese is fantastic.  Great service."}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly staff, and the food was amazing!! I know it's a seafood place, but they have the best fried chicken wings I've ever had. The happy hour selection is awesome and affordable. The wife and go at least twice a month. The hot pot specials are delicious also."}
{"text":"We liked the food. The calamari app was sooooo good! I feel like our entrees sat in the window too long. But if served fresh, would have been amazing! Our bar server was ok, never really checked in and we had to ask for more drinks, BUT others we asked for the check and a box were fast and efficient. We'd go back but not to the bar. Shame for good food and bad service.  We went on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food!! It was great portions and good prices for seafood! Great date spot."}
{"text":"When we asked how long of a wait, we were told 45 minutes.  I agreed and they asked for my cellphone number so they could text me once table was ready.  I thought that was nice.  I could even log into The List App to see our place in line.

Once we sat, we were told that the fish is fresh, swimming within 48 hours prior.

My wife said her halibut was the best she had ever had.  Our daughter enjoyed her fish and chips.  I got 'The King'.  I didn't think the portion size was big enough, but it was very tasty.  The highlight for me was that the crab leg was pre-cut which I had never experienced before.  I asked how they did it and was told with kitchen shears.  They get a lot of snow birds that aren't able to open the legs on their own.

We were very happy.  It isn't inexpensive but worth it."}
{"text":"What a fantastic find in Gilbert. The lobster mac and cheese, the king pot, and the clam chowder were all delicious. Fantastic service, fairly priced, and they even have happy hour 7 days a week. If you have not tried High Tide I highly recommend it (pun intended). Put it on your list, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I have now eaten here twice since it has been opened.  I can see it is going to be my new go to place for a different kind of seafood / comfort food restaurant.  I have had the fried chicken, chicken wings, Gumbo, Shrimp pot, Salmon and Cioppini.  Every dish was superbly prepared and my meals were super.  The staff is extremely friendly.  This place has only been open for 3 weeks and yet it seems like it is running like a fine tuned machine.  I met the owner tonight and he really wants to create a great customer experience.  Next on my list is to try the fish and chips and their burgers."}
{"text":"Meh. Nice inside. Food is not great at all. Lobster Mac n cheese was over cooked and no flavor. Calamari was gross. Crab cake - blah. Nothing interesting or new. Even if you haven't been here you've been here and eaten the food 1000 times. Not cheap either. Just not good seafood. Go to blue wasabi and have the calamari salad."}
{"text":"Delicious food! The service was welcoming, friendly and attentive. We shared the high tide hot pot and it was so so so delicious. The drinks were on happy hour from 3 to 7 and they did not disappoint. If we would've had room we would've tried any of their five amazing desserts, we were way too full. I love the ambience and we will definitely be back. What a great find!"}
{"text":"Fresh seafood, friendly staff. Lobster bisque was tasty, oysters were fresh, high tide steam pot was full of seafood, and even their bread pudding was amazing. Will definitely go back to explore the menu."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant! The service and the food are amazing!  We try to go once a week, but by the end of the week I really crave that lobster bisque."}
{"text":"Update: Came here for Fathers Day and tried the new Summer Happy Hour menu. 

Fantastic: The food was good and (warning) the Lobster Mac and Cheese is enough to share with 3 people. The calamari comes out in sticks, not rings, and the chicken wings were good as well. I'm a super fan of their homemade hot sauces and the honey hot was just as great as the house hot sauce. The Eastern oysters are meaty (!!) so be prepared to chew! 

Downside: I grew up in the South and when I see anything Cajun, it has to be tasted. It was a good broth but not a Cajun shrimp boil as advertised. 

Still good and still my fav! 


First time here and this place could do no wrong. We had the Tide and Gumbo steam pots along with the oysters and it was all delicious. The homemade hot sauce was so good and was great on the oysters. I put it in my Bloody Mary, which was the best decision I made today. My only complaint: I couldn't finish and I really wanted too! Try this out and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"5/10/14... Had lunch there this sfternoon for a party of 4.. Open environment and very clean. Nice roomy seating.. Large raw bar with plenty of seating. Friendly staff. Plenty of smiles.
 Lobster soup was excellent The salmon BLT sandwich melted in your mouth. Fresh buns and the side of slaw was fresh and unique with pineapple chips in them. Very tasty. A little pricey but you get what you pay for. A seafood WINNER !"}
{"text":"I walked in on a Thursday night not to busy and was greeted wonderfully by the hotess with black hair she sat me at the bar and made sure I had everything I needes to enjoy my dining experience. I ordered the lobster bisk. By far the best bisk I have ever had no watery or bland taste to it like I have had at other restraunts. The bar has an amazing drink selection, music, tvs, and an awesome view of the steam pots! One of the cooks Marcus was great I watched him work all of the steam pots and he answered every question I had about working the steam pots and what ingredients are in the steam pot selection of the menu, he really made my experience worth it.  Very friendly and informative. After a while I noticed a man cussing at employees and getting very out of line because of little mistakes I asked a waitress who he was and she said it was in fact the owner. I love this restraunt and have been coming here for months but once I saw the manger treat his staff how he did I was so appalled and couldn't believe what I was hearing. This is no way to treat your staff in private and especially not in PUBLIC with customers around. Because of him I will not be putting any more money towards this place! Will definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"Much better food and choices than when they firat opened. Scallops were good & the smoke salmon appetizer was delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here last year for my birthday and remember it being really good so I decided to come back. When I arrived the hostess told me I could talk a seat any were. I stat at the bar. It took about 10min befor I was greeted. After I was it took about another 10min for my water to get to the table. The waiter brought me a sample of different sauces after that I never saw him. When some one did finally come to take my order I decided to go with the gumbo. It has shrimp, sausage, chicken, and craw fish with dirty rice. It has a nice thick consistency very Savory flavor.  Best gumbo that I have had. I really like the consistency and the thickness of the sause. Definitely makes there gumbo stand of from others. Most have more a a brother like sauce . I got the lunch option witch was still huge. I berly put a dent in it. I also got the bread and butter and there was HAIR in it yucckkk. One I showed the server he changed it out right away. They had a really big party there as well I think that a why mabye their customer service was so horrible. The only reason I'm giving three starts is becasue the gumbo was that damn good."}
{"text":"Second time here during Happy Hour. First time was on Sunday and enjoyed the bloody mary bar very much. This time on Saturday night and sat at the bar. More crowded on Saturday evening. Hubby and I really like this place. Not only is the food really good, the cocktails are strong and the ambience is great. I can't wait to try more on the menu. Today I took a picture of the oysters on half shell and ceviche, both delicious."}
{"text":"Upon a recommendation from a friend we ate here on a week day evening. Got seated on the patio right away and were taken care of fairly well to start. Had a small Caesar salad, which was mediocre (warm and limp lettuce) and fish and chips.  The fish had a very heavy batter coating which turned soggy fairly quickly, but it tasted okay. The slaw that came with the dish was unusual, but not particularly good (personal preference here) and the sauce for the fish was just okay as well. All in all, for an upscale eatery, it wasn't really that special. Maybe some of their other fare is better. Drinks were allowed to sit empty several times and the iced tea was warm. The little things just didn't come together on this particular night and so three-stars is the best we can do. We might go back, but I doubt it."}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment three times and all three occasions were great.  The food was excellent, the drinks were great and the service very prompt and attentive.  It is worth a visit!  They also have a few dishes for those who would not prefer  seafood."}
{"text":"We had lunch here last Thursday and it was AMAZING! I had the BAKED ORANGE ROUGHY Served with Risotto, Grilled Asparagus and Dill Leek Cream Sauce and it was delicious!!  My hubby had the \"FISH AND CHIPS\" and it was Battered Alaskan Cod, Served with Mixed Fries, Peach Cashew Slaw and Remoulade. Cooked to perfection and the Remoulade was so tasty. Pricey for lunch however, the servings are very large and the quality and freshness of the food makes it hard to resist.

I loved the atmosphere and the service was friendly and exceptional especially considering how busy they were.  The owner came by our table to see how everything was and that was appreciated.  I would highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Seafood in the desert can't be that good, right?  WRONG!  This place rocks.  Owners Kim and Chris are always on hand to make sure guests are treated right, the staff is awesome, and Jen, Dan, Jasmine at the bar make the best drinks in town!  We come here quite often, and are never let down.  If somehow you manage to save enough room after dinner for a sweet treat, try the bread pudding, delicious!  Keep up the good work, team.  We love your place!"}
{"text":"Random seafood and a semi celebratory night brought us here.  Came way late, sat at the bar, immediately made friends with chefs, server and hostess.  All were very gracious and made us feel welcome.  Appetizer - beer clams. So good.  Not too salty even though there was pancetta in the broth.  Pickled red onions were an unexpected touch but so good.  We split the gumbo and it was great.  Their homemade hot sauce is to die for.  Overall, you probably shouldn't go here because they are gonna get so popular and i will have to make a Monday night reservation! ;)"}
{"text":"Great job!!  This is a fun new place to eat and drink.  The wine list is well priced and you could make a meal out of just the soups and the appetizers.  This sure ain't your goofy Red Lobster.  Locally owned and well run."}
{"text":"Pretty good. The lobster macaroni and cheese was not very good at all. The owner should try this at Capital Grill or Mastros to see how its supposed to be done. Theirs has a weird texture.

Everything else was pretty decent but nothing to write home about.

Be prepared to spend $30 for a plate if you want to seafood plate.

Nice atmosphere for sure. Decent happy hour too."}
{"text":"I am giving high tide two stars for the Prickled Pink drink and the iced tea. They were amazing. We ordered the sampler appetizer and we couldn't eat the crab because it smelled so awful. We told our friendly server and he offered to replace them with warm crab legs. When the came out they were just as bad. When we suggested they tasted old our server insisted they were shipped in daily and were \"on point\". We all had to take a trip to the restroom to wash our hands because it was so smelly. The lobster mac wasn't amazing, the fish and chips were salty yet bland, the peach cole slaw looked better than it tasted. Won't be back."}
{"text":"For a Friday night we were seated right away, apparently we beat the dinner rush.  The Food is tasty and the portions are very generous. Service is adequate and as expected for this type of restaurant.  My only complain...both pasta entrees we ordered were overcook. Otherwise 5 stars."}
{"text":"From all the rave from other people, we Finally tried this place as well.. Now keep in mind, this will be judged per 1. I am originally from Massachusetts, 2. Pappadeaux is my FAVE place in AZ.. 

Original walk in appearance, VERY nice, well laid out place, bar, vip/group area, and even patio. Place was well lit, Very Clean, and staff very friendly.. Wow,,, i was thinking this is gonna hurt my pocket now :-( ... on to the food and ordering,

Apps:
Calamari - Long meat strips of the calamari nicely breaded and cooked perfect not chewy and still soft. Aioli was ok, as well as the tomato sauce. This is pretty similar to 4 peaks (but 4 peaks aioli wins)
Garlic Cheese Bread w Crab - Very delicious, and definitely enough crab to know there is actually crab in it.. 

Entree:
CAJUN STYLE SHRIMP BOIL - Wife got this and she loved it, it had really great broth, and their homemade bread was awesome for dipping. 

The King Steam Pot - The light saffron was pretty great, and definitely try the cream before ordering, a lot of people wont like that sauce.. So be warned.. The amount of seafood in the dish was perfect balance with the pasta. only issue , i thought was the Crab leg they give you on top, get sauce all over it, before u have to pick it up to get the meat out, should be served on the side maybe so not as messy.. but all in all great dish.

Staff / Bartender was very informative and even the one to suggest trying that saffron cream before ordering.. very attentive and friendly.. 

As far as a seafood \"Restaurant\", I'm not sure how to classify this place, there food is really great, but there is a lack of full plate options / entrees. Dont get me wrong, an appetizer and Steam Pot, you will be FULL as this doesn't hinder the actual restaurant though, as the option they do have were all very good. 

Definitely will be back.. Our plan is Happy Hour, get couple drinks, and a Couple appetizers n relax.. KUDOS High Tide... Go Patriots, btw ;-)"}
{"text":"First time visitor! Went with another couple. We had an awesome time. The food was amazing. I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My husband and I took our two little ones in for lunch today. It was a Saturday and our waitress mentioned that happy hour is from 11-6:30 which was nice to know. The boys had chicken tenders and a cheeseburger. Both were nice sized portions and were really good for kids meals. My husband had the halibut sandwich with sweet potatoes fries. He said its one of the best sandwiches he's ever had. I had the lobster bisque and Caesar salad. The bisque was to die for with the great taste of lobster present throughout each bite. The salad did not have a horrific amount of dressing on it like a lot of places have. It was light and still could taste the lettuce. All around amazing experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"They had really great margarita! Seafood tower was good! They had a few different type of shucked oysters all sweet ! And great noodles over all it was good food great friends kind of night !"}
{"text":"Baked orange roughy was delicious!! And the key lime pie was perfect! Service was great as well. The atmosphere is fun!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. 5 stars for food, atmosphere, service and more. This place is absolutely gorgeous and perfect for a date or family get together. Best seafood I've ever tasted and I was incredibly impressed seeing as this state does not border the ocean. Better seafood here than in California from the bay area. 10/10 will eat here in the future and for the rest of my life.
There's a long wait but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Nice looking place with fair to good seafood. Spiced for white people. Matches the diversity in all the employees. Seafood of the corn."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend visited tonight and everything was absolutely FANTASTIC. We had the calamari, clam chowder, The King Pot, and Gelato for dessert. Everything exceeded expectations 100%. My boyfriend ordered the Lost Coast Great White draft and went crazy about that as well. Our server Zach also gave amazing service and recommendations. Definitely try this place if you haven't!"}
{"text":"High Tide has the best seafood in town.  I've been back several times with different friends to share it with.  Service is excellent. One thing, though, on my last visit, they menu no longer had ceviche which was one of my favorite things. Still the best place for seafood though."}
{"text":"Wife has wanted to come here since it opened. ..Friends telling her how much they like happy hour.  Was bummed with the food part of the experience. 

Tried a variety for happy hour figured I could hit a few winners..

1. Lobster mac: not much flavor at all. Biggest disappointment since biggest cost 
2. Calamari: atrocious for seafood place. Super Dry and again flavorless. 
3. Clam chowder: awesome. 
4. Kids chicken tender: delicious (according to daughter)
5. Beer cold 
6. Service great. Waitress saw we didn't like the calamari and volunteered to take care of it. 

At the end of the day, the waitress attention, friendliness and the reviews from our friends will bring me back for another try. Everyone has a bad day, right?
We shall see if they redeem and I get a nice happy hour close to home !  If they redeem themselves, I will definitely adjust the review accordingly."}
{"text":"If money is not a concern first off congratulations. If you are on a budget look out. 
Food is fantastic. Fresh and seasoned perfectly. Great staff and excellent service. Now I know that seafood, especially in the desert is going to be expensive but $33 for a dozen oysters? $15 hamburger? It seemed excessive. 
Now...Happy Hour is a good deal and to be fair the drink prices were reasonable. For a special night out or a celebration the is an excellent seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my fiancé. The restaurant was much bigger than I was expecting. I liked the large booths, and the decor was nice.

My fiancé had the oysters, and they were wonderful. He was impressed.  Unfortunately he has a lot of food allergies. Gluten, dairy, tomatoes. So it limits his choices. They hardly have anything he could eat. He pan seared halibut minus the butter. It was just okay. 

I had the Tide Roast. It was excellent! Next time I would just get the plain rice. The dirty rice didn't do much for me. I loved the hot sauce they brought with the bread!  I added that to my Tide Roast, and it gave it a nice kick. 

Too full for dessert. Service was ok. Nothing amazing. Overall I would go back, but my fiancé would only go for the oysters.  There wasn't much else he could have."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Sept. 3.  We shared the High Tide Tower of seafood.  It was excellent and truly more than two people could eat.  Out waiter was attentive without being intrusive.   Will definitely go back to try more of their dinner items."}
{"text":"I think High Tide might be better on a second visit, but the first one only merits 3 stars. First, I sat at the bar for 10 minutes before anyone approached me, even though the bartender walked behind me and I said hello and the floor manager made eye contact with me. I ordered the salmon, which came with a sickly white sauce that is so unnecessary with salmon, yet the salmon itself had no seasoning. The risotto was way too creamy and the broccoli was tossed in oil. This dish was simply much heavier than it should have been and therefore rather disappointing. Cool atmosphere and I was asked about my meal several times, so a star for that."}
{"text":"Spectacular food, service, ambiance! This place is truly a home run.  If you use yelp for a price point please ignore this menu. All of the appetizers, which are actually meals, are 25-50% off during a Happy Hour!

We had a shrimp cocktail and large bowl of creamy lobster bisque to start off with.  For our meals my husband tried a steam pot boil  and I had the crab cake.  Everything was delicious, but the lobster bisque won my heart! My hubby had a couple local 16oz craft porters as well.  $60.00 was our bill!!!
4 meals + 2 crafts I'll say that's pretty impressive. 

Keep up the great work! Not only will we be back, but you've hooked us.  We will tell anyone who'll listen.

Your new regulars, 
Jolie and Chip"}
{"text":"A little pricey but it's seafood what can u expect ?!? Big portions and very friendly waiters"}
{"text":"From the lobster bisque, Mac and cheese, tide hot pot, halibut, and free bday beignets...this place eliminates Red Lobster from our options. Fresh and reasonably priced, with genuine private owned hospitality, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"After the fam had been here for my b-day celebration, K & I decided to stop by again for HH.
We stopped in on a Saturday while C's current play was in it's 4th performance. Finding HH on Saturdays is pretty tough but HTSB has one that runs till 6:30.
K ordered a Coffee Bean Martini ($7) and I ordered a G&T ($5). Both drinks were tasty and our bartender was very personable.  Hanging at the bar with a complete view of the dining room was great. We watched as the bartenders created yummy looking drinks and the \"shucker\" built beautiful clam & mussel trays. Presentation is an art and it was obvious there were a few artists in the house.
K & I ordered Steamed Mussels ($10 HH) & Calamari ($8 HH). The Mussels were steamed with white wine, garlic, shallots & tomato. Yummy! The Bread was fine but nothing special which is a bummer because the broth is soooo good.
The Calamari was beautifully fried and served with a very nice lemon aioli and a tomato cream sauce. Both were very good dipping sauces.
Good drinks, great steamed mussels, great calamari, good bread, ok prices, great staff. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"Service and food were spectacular. Cory the bartender was very friendly and accommodating. A plus to the entire experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoy High Tide Seafood Bar & Grill. They have many options and the dishes are not shy on protein. Although the prices may be high, you definitely get what you pay for. 

This is my fourth visit here and my past two visits included: lobster bisque, oysters, lobster mac n'cheese, fish and chips (replacing cod with halibut) and the spicy seafood pasta! Each dish was very delicious and big enough for sharing. However if I had to pick a meal for anyones first visit definitely go with the lobster bisque, oysters and mac n'cheese! You may have leftovers but it will be worth it. Whenever my husband and I go we always want to order the lobster bisque and find ourselves scraping the cup! The Mac n'cheese is huge, definitely great for sharing and so delicious! I'm literally craving it as I'm writing this now!

Give this place a try and you'll probably want to go back because there are so many other options to try!"}
{"text":"Incredible food that tastes like they literally pulled it out of the sea and put it on your plate. I recommend the calamari, \"The King\" and the \"Cioppino!\""}
{"text":"I can't believe we haven't been here before.  We had a dozen Blue Point oysters-they were delicious!  We also had the lobster mac n' cheese, the Chilean Sea Bass and The King steam pot.  Everything was truly delightful.  My daughter kept saying her Mac n cheese was very yummy.  We went during happy hour and the prices were reasonable.  Make a reservation as lots of people coming in.  Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I love this place! Amazing seafood in the desert!
I've been here at least 5 different times and each time was amazing! The seafood stew is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great food a little on the expensive side but service was good and food was plentiful and delicious."}
{"text":"It's a great place to get some amazing seafood. The prices are really high though so bring some money to it. The food is really delicious. I brought some friends who ordered the Alaskan crab and the high tide dish that has mussels, fish and shrimp. I just ordered a simple appetizer that contains sausage and cheese. The place is very decorative and nice to go to."}
{"text":"Had lunch. Excellent service and their specialty,  a steamed pot of seafood in a creamy tomato sauce with rice was delicious.  Also had the arctic char which was fresh and well cooked. Nice, clean and roomy."}
{"text":"Yum! I ordered the tide roast steam pot, it was delicious! My husband ordered the gumbo, and although his food order got cancelled, the waitress made it up to us by buying him a beer and dessert. His dish was great too! We also had the lobster bisque and crab cake, both were really good....will definitely be going back to try other stuff!"}
{"text":"Our first time there and we have nothing bad to say about your excellent food and service!! Yum yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"Great service from Sarah, loved her recommendations. Wonderful food. We found a new seafood home in the desert."}
{"text":"We've visited High Tide for Happy Hour and dinner three times in the last year and have decided we probably won't visit again as there are better places to spend $50 to $100 on seafood and drinks in the valley.  The food is not consistent.  The chowder is ok...the calamari is good...the crab cake was meh...the mussels were yummy...the ceviche was poor (way too sweet) and the fish was pretty good.  Kind of expensive too.  It's hard to know if your next dish will be delicious or sent back.  Nice atmosphere and good service, but I'd rather head to Angry Crab for a $100 dinner."}
{"text":"My mom and I frequent this place for lunch and it's become our go-to for special occasions, as we live pretty close.

I have tried the prickled pink cocktail wirh the cucumber vodka, lavender and prickly pair, which is very tasty. Also, the oyster bloody mary with the Sriracha vodka is great (with a little horseradish added.) I have heard they have a bloody mary bar brunch on the weekends, but have yet to do that. (Stay tuned!)

We always start with the crab cake, which is amazing with the tempura fried avocado.... but the real reason we kept coming back here is because of the lobster bisque. It's so rich and amazing! 

Occasionally we will do oysters, but not every time. I pretty much get the same thing every time, and that is a Caesar salad with the grilled salmon. The salmon is always medium rare and fantastic and the creamy garlic dressing is wonderful. 

My mom used to get the halibut in the dill and leek sauce. They recently changed it to orange roughy, but it has that same great sauce and she still loves it.

The peach cashew cole slaw is also great, fresh and light.

Also, they have creme brulee. Enough said.

Our service is usually awesome, as the place is pretty empty during lunchtime when we go. The only time we saw it really busy was on mother's day.

Would totally recommend this place to anyone who likes salmon, oysters, lobster bisque or crabcakes!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The server was unmentionable great. We were able to bring In our own cake. The food had lots of flavor very satisfying to the palate"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon. The place was fairly empty. I was greeted and seated immediately despite the sign out front stating that reservations were being accepted. Maybe they were expecting a lunch rush, but that never happened. The waitress was prompt to take out drink order. The décor here has an upscale maritime feel to it. I kind of liked the candle centerpiece on the table. The restroom was very clean.

I decided to have the fish and chips. This is 3 pieces of battered deep fried cod with a generous side of fries. The fries are half sweet potato and half regular potato. I also got a small dish of home made tartar sauce and a bowl of home made coleslaw. The order came up in about 15 - 20 minutes. The fish obviously just out of the fryer because it was too hot to eat. (a good thing because nobody likes cold fish.) It was good. The fish was flaky and the batter was tasty. The coleslaw was ok. I liked that it wasn't floating in sauce like say KFC, but they put weird stuff in it like peaches and nuts. The fries were thin and somewhat crispy. I prefer home fries myself. That being said I did ask if they were homemade. They said, \"No they are frozen. We find that they do better in the fryer.\" 

All in all I feel the experience was a mixed bag. I would come back for the fish, but not for the fries or coleslaw. There are other things on the menu that are intriguing, for instance the Surf and Turf Burger, Lobster bisque, and Crab Cake sound worth trying. I don't feel the fish and chips were enough to bring me back for a second go around, at least not for 15 bucks. I can get good fish with home made fries close to home for less. If I do come back it will be to sample one of their steam pots."}
{"text":"It's a nice looking place...clean.......nice theme....until the food comes.
We had them bring us samples of four soups and stews, and ALL of them were TASTELESS and BLAND. Oh my....... That's should have been our cue to excuse ourselves and leave, but we decided to not order soups or stews and chose from the starters and mains instead. That was our first mistake.
We should have known.

We sent back the clams, which were overcooked and tough and cooked in tasteless broth that tasted like water with some beer in it. We couldn't even taste the beer. The crab cake was OK.  The beef ribs with mashed potatoes was OK, although the beef wasn't as tender as the waiter said and the mashed potatoes were of course, BLAND.  The beet salad was GOOD.  At least it had flavor.  Their famous lobster Mac and cheese, was beyond BLAND, $16 worth of utter BLAND.  

The waiter completely FORGOT our scallops order. Maybe it was for the better?  

We went on a Sunday evening and the place had a few other customers but was pretty dead...... There were more employees than customers.  The manager looked lethargic and uninspired.

I'm absolutely certain that I can take the leftovers and flavor them up to be MUCH better than when they came out of the kitchen. Sad, but true.

What a HUGE disappointment. Never again."}
{"text":"This place is great! Not only is it really clean, spacious, and modern but the food and service is awesome. We loved the food and the environment. This place is our new favorite!!"}
{"text":"Got there and the wait was average for a Saturday night (45min). Added our names to the list (they offered to text us when our table is ready). We walked around a store waiting. After about 45 minutes we returned and asked about the wait. They told us they gave away our table and that the tried our number many times. We didn't have any missed calls or texts. Luckily there was another one they found (kept my review and temper in check).

I ordered the fish and chips while my wife got the salmon. While we waited the server offered bread which we accepted (it was listed as $1 on the menu but she didn't charge for it). Service wasn't the fastest (not outrageously slow), but expected due to a busy Saturday evening. Everything was delicious. We will definitely be going back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"First visit tonight. Couples night out. We shared the lobster Mac-N-Cheese, excellent! Large portion could be an App for 4. Our friends got the calamari. That also was very good, not your typical 'rubber bands'. Crispy strips from the body vs tenticals. 
3 out of 4 got the Cesar salad with one NE clam chowder, all solid but no anchovies on the salad for the purest in me. The ladies chose the short ribs entree that was received very well, doggy bag required. Funny, the guys both went for the Cioppiono steamer. It was loaded with goodness. To top it off we had the salted Carmel gelato and bread pudding deserts....ugg,..kinda full at this point. I also had 2 Left Hand milk stout pints for only $3.50 ea! It all added up to a healthy bill but we all felt it was worth it. I'm sure to return."}
{"text":"Had lunch here as part of a network group. I must say the food was fantastic. Great flavors and nice selection. I ordered oysters and they were huge I also like the decor of the restaurant. Nice open floor plan with a modern yet rustic seaside look. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to High Tide and both times have been great.  First time was on a whim for a late lunch.  It was not busy mid afternoon on a weekday but we didn't expect it to be.  We sat at the bar and chatted with the woman that seemed to be handling serving and bartending.  Food was great and service was very good.  Tonight we went back for a dinner date with another couple.  We split two entres, my wife had the surf-turf burger which is a large burger topped with crab meat and aolie sauce.  It was fantastic.  I had the seared halibut and it was very good.  Service was great, atmosphere was warm.  All in all a great date night.  Bill for the two of us was $74 with drinks."}
{"text":"Our second adventure to High Tide was as memorable as the first. Really liked the gumbo and they have the top rated Bell's Two Hearted Ale on tap! All 4 of us enjoyed our meals which included Halibut Fish n Chips, Shrimp Fish n Chips and Seafood Enchiladas. Pleasant atmosphere. Be sure to make a reservation in advance as their waiting area seemed a little bit crowded, and for good reason!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The calamari and shrimp cocktail are the best! That horseradish in the cocktail sauce is the bees knees. Delicious meal every time and very good service."}
{"text":"we had no resevatuons.. open in the bar....but of course when a guy told us we could sit at a high top, then someone else told us we couldn't as it was reserved.    then the server pulled one chair from the bar to the other side.  i let her know the guy nexr to that seat was leaving and asked if she could get another chair so the 2 of us could sit..  she said no.  we've eaten here before...food is great...service sucked then. Will come back in the summer when it's slow and you can actually get ok service."}
{"text":"mmm...well went for restaurant week....they say its always that busy on the weekends....I'll give um kudos for trying....I think the steam pots make the food sort of bland or maybe its the stock/sauce....some sauces thin some sludge like...wine and beer concept look nice.....the bread should be a killer sourdough not the nothing rolls they serve...not sure what else to say.....stuck in the middle"}
{"text":"Well well well where should I begin? !  
Drinks? Ok.....
Mojito was made like no other! My fiancé and I thought it was super fresh and yummy. I got a pickled pear (I think) supper tasty. 

Appetizer THE LOBSTER MAC &CHEESE!! MY FAVVVVVV. all I can say is you MUST try. 

Entrée. My fiancé got the steak I loved it more than he did only because of the cherry demi glaze not his fav but definitely mine!
I got the chicken breast and my fiancé like it more than me, funny how it turned out that way hahha but we loved how moist and flavorful the chicken was.

Oh and I cant forget about our amazing helpful everything you could ask for in a server MATTHEW!   He's Great!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the strip mall location, this place has great food and atmosphere. There were 4 plus a baby in our group and the hostess and server were both warm and accommodating.

We had calamari (amazing) and the meat & cheese board (just ok, loved the spicy mustard though) as appetizers. I ordered the mahi mahi special, and my husband had The King. One of the others in our party had the buttermilk chicken. Everything was very good and large portions.

Four stars instead of five because I wish there were a few more fresh / grilled fish entree options. 

Can't wait to go and sit at the bar for happy hour."}
{"text":"Had a 6;30 reservation waited about 15 minutes to be seated. The hostess told us they 
had a table for us instead of a booth which we had reserved, would like that and said \"  cocktails are on the house\"  for not getting  what we had reserved.  Great start to
our dinner. The food was outstanding"}
{"text":"Soooooo good! We went here for our anniversary this evening. We had oysters, sausage and cheese, crab, grilled berramundi, rose wine....SOooooooo good!!!!!!  We will definitely be back! Very impressed. Everything was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Service is awesome.  Food is great.  Ask for Kevin at the bar.  Going back for sure!"}
{"text":"An odd place for a seafood restaurant, between a Kohl's and a Dollar Tree, but we decided to give it a try. Love the decor, it's very spacious and even though it was busy, it didn't feel crowded. Our server was very nice and attentive. We started with the lobster bisque, and I could have had 10 bowls of it. Delicious! Husband also liked it very much, and we were wishing we had ordered bowls instead of cups. 

We played it safe on main entrees, I had the Surf and Turf Burger and husband had the fish and chips. They were average, and I felt a bit disappointed there wasn't more crab meat on my burger. Still, we want to come back and try their steamed items, they are made fresh right at the bar. A nice little gem tucked away in a basic strip mall."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with High Tide. Had the pleasure of eating here on a Saturday for lunch. Place wasn't crowded but still had plenty of employees busy at work. 

We ordered few appetizers including the crab cakes, high tide combo and calamari. I have to say I didn't know we could get that fresh seafood here in AZ. The crab cake was loaded with crab chunks and it was seasoned perfectly. The mussels and clams were so juicy and plump, I almost though we were near a beach somewhere. The calamari had no resemblance of anything fried. It was perfect texture and taste; it came with two different dipping sauces.

The lunch entrees were equally delicious. We ordered gumbo with oysters, Cioppino, and fish and chips. Everything was so flavorful without being greasy or salty. Just loved every dish served here.

The staff was friendly and service was prompt. Perfect atmosphere to take your family, friends, coworkers, and visitors alike. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Great seabass, friends had several other meals and all were great. Excellent happy hour."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my family last night 4-29-14 around 6:30 p.m. ordering the Cioppino.  I was the only one that ordered one of the Hot Steam Pot Specialties.  I was sick as a dog come midnight.  I called this morning and asked to talk to a manager or owner to let them know that something needed to be checked for freshness or maybe it was a bad batch of seafood.  Chris came on the phone and when I told him that the soup had made me sick he asked what I had for lunch.  Then he told me that the flu was going around.  No apology, no sympathy....nothing.  I don't have the flu and I felt much better after throwing up until 3 in the morning.  I had breakfast and went to work.  He claimed that it was his best selling dish and that the seafood was flown in daily.  Oh please...no excuses.  Something in that dish was bad.  It had to be either the clams or mussels.  But Chris didn't take ownership that something may have gone wrong.  I won't be back and 1 star was a generous rating."}
{"text":"Just WOW. My husband decided to take me here tonight for a little \"date night\" and just WOW. The food was WAAAAY better than we had even hoped, the service was good and each course came right on time. To say I'm impressed would be an understatement. Loved every single bit."}
{"text":"High Tide has hit our list of go-to restaurants! Everything on the menu is delicious! Be careful though .. the portions are pretty large. 
Highly recommend for anyone looking for fresh delicious seafood!"}
{"text":"First time at High Tide and definitely a good experience. Fun atmosphere with friendly and helpful staff. For appetizer we had the Cajun Shrimp Boil with charred sweet corn relish. It was awesome and enough shrimp for 4 people. For dinner I decided on the nightly special: Australian Sea Bass with Mango glaze, roasted veggies and deep fried wedge of avocado. Cooked excellent with great combo of flavors. My wife went with the \"King\" which is a pasta combo of every seafood you can think of in a steam pot preparation with a rich saffron broth. It had king crab, scallops, salmon, calamari and mushrooms. She loved it!! Overall good experience and many more dishes I would love to try."}
{"text":"This place is so, so, so good! It is tough to find good seafood in the desert, but this place definitely fits the bill. We went for lunch and split a high tide combo. Oh my gosh was it ever delicious! This plate was a great way for them to show off and for us to appreciate just how high quality the seafood was. There was a mountain of cold seafood and three homemade sauces to dip into if we wanted them and we sure did - they were soooo good! We sat at the bar so we had a great view of all of the steam pots that were being cooked for other people in the restaurant and they smelled divine. I am not sure who the woman was behind the bar, but she was definitely somebody (owner maybe?). She was so knowledgeable about every dish, every cooking method, where all of the seafood came from and she had this really cute east coast accent (she was from Massachusetts I think) so she and hubby were reliving their east coast lives. I can't tell you guys just how good this place was. Go and try it for yourselves!!!!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed. I ordered the crab cakes and steamed mussels ... The crab cakes tasted like it was made with canned crabmeat and a good deal of the mussels were served to me unopened... a total no no. 

I was looking for a great seafood place because I just moved here from Cape Cod. I won't go back.

The bar setup is nuts. They have to walk around the outside of the bar to serve you."}
{"text":"Everything was good. Waitress: Betsy, efficient and sweet. Food: hubs LOVED it. I thought everything was good. Service: prompt. 

We ordered:

Apps: 

Steamed mussels: perfection 

Dozen happy hour oysters on the half shell: great

Lobster mac & cheese: ridiculously rich and creamy and thick and heavy and a HUGE portion, beware; it's enough for 4 people, easily.

Dinner: 

Chiopinno: not crazy about the fennel, teragon sauce. Not much fish. No pasta or rice. Broth-based-very light.

Fish & chips: fries were thin and crispy and hot and fish was beer-battered and tasty. 

Desserts: 

Benniets: sent them back. Didn't like them at all. They smelled like pizza dough and they were completely air-filled and hollow inside. The chocolate sauce was like that sickeningly sweet cheap Hershey's syrup you add to milk to make it chocolate milk. Just gross.

Creme brûlée: very good

Galato: two scoops, one salted caramel and one pistachio. Kinda weird combo but you can't go wrong with galato!"}
{"text":"We had the chiopino, the jambalaya, and the fried chicken. All very good in a very relaxing setting. The owner greets you at the door and checks every table during dinner.  Definitely a repeat."}
{"text":"A great seafood restaurant that combines excellent service and food together for a wonderful experience. We've dined many times and it's a favorite stop for our out of town family and guests. Prices are above average but still within reasonable for seafood in the desert."}
{"text":"First time. The joint was cool, loved the atmosphere. Staff was great, friendly and very informative . I ordered the high tide combo and that's where a small disappointment happened. Everything was good until I got to the crab legs. One was so bad it stunk like feet. The lobster mac n cheese was good, a bit on the greasy side but good. Ill have to try it again."}
{"text":"Decided to celebrate a special occasion at High Tide for our first visit. We couldn't have been more pleased! 

The calamari was so tender and flavorful. The lobster bisque and clam chowder were amazing. We had sea bass and the spicy pasta... Outstanding! Fresh and perfectly cooked. The evening finished with bread pudding... Yummy. In addition the take care to have a great selection of craft beers on tap - grapefruit sculpin!"}
{"text":"One of the best in the East Valley!   Visit weekly since they opened, NEVER disappointed.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"First off, my wife doesn't like seafood, but that's ok, they're non-seafood food is excellent as well. I would recommend calling ahead a few days to make a reservation as the wait time can get up there. I would also recommend getting there during happy hour, because the meal and appetizer deals are excellent. The burgers are top notch, it was on par with any burger place, and the fries are great too. They have some of the best ranch I've had too, ao grab that for dipping. We really come here for the cheesy garlic bread. Get it without the crab, and it's super cheap on the happy hour menu. Even the kids meals are excellent. My son had the chick fingers, which were tempura and it came with fries. That was better chicken than most restaurants have, and it was for kids!"}
{"text":"Portions are small for the price. Service was way slow. Good beer list, both on tap and bottles. Spent $75 on two of us. Oysters were good quality, as was all the seafood. Just not good enough to come back."}
{"text":"great food, great service and nice ambience (Chicago style)"}
