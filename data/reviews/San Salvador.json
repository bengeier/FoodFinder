{"text":"Best Pupusas in Arizona. Phoenix has a Salvadoran restaurant and it's here."}
{"text":"Great food great service all around a good experience if you are in the area stop by desert sky mall and hit up San Salvador in the food court for some of the best pupusas in the world!!!"}
{"text":"The worst service everywhere. I got home had all my order mixed up so I called hoping that they would understand and offer to fix since they messed. The lady on the phone was beyond rude. Pretty much just said you have to come now or I can do anything about and I have to go because we are busy. Never going back. Waste of money and time. Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"We Discovered this place by accident, when walking around the mall we got hungry of course!  But being tired of everything else we wanted to see if they sold PUPUSAS...which is my favorite Salvadorian Dish...and they do! Delicious!! i usually get \"revuelta\" ones and my Wife really likes the cheese ones...so now that we found this place we come here often...usually Sundays after church if we are in the mood for some really good pupusas. The staff is really attentive and friendly, they give you this card that's sorta like a loyalty card...and stamp it every time you visit...by like the 9th visit you get a free meal...who wouldn't want a free meal!?"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I have been coming here for many years.  It is so delicious!  The pupusas must be an old family recipe because they are way better here than several other places I've tried.  The prices are really good too. You can eat like a king for less than $10 here.  The one bad review on Yelp was obviously written by an idiot with a broken watch and a sense of entitlement.  I have eaten here literally hundreds of times and I can tell you the wait has never been more than about ten minutes except for a couple of times when the mall was packed with people and they had a lot of customers, the wait was about 15 minutes... but well worth it for such delicious food made from scratch!    I'll be eating pupusas here for many years to come."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!! Pupusas revueltas are my usual and they are to die for! Ive also had Pollo en Crema-DELISH!! They offer various stews on the weekends that are homemade goodness. You MUST try their famous \"Ensalada Drink\" which has little pieces of fresh fruit in it-YUM! This is my new favorite place and I am there at least twice a week. Prices are super cheap too! See you there!"}
{"text":"Delicious pupusas! The wait was somewhat long otherwise I would have given them 5stars. There are limited Salvadoran restaurants in the area. I was glad this one has reasonable prices as I recently tried a Salvadoran food truck on the west side for food truck Fridays. I suggest you try it out, but be patient with waiting for your food."}
{"text":"We were meeting up with my brother for Saturday lunch and were craving El Salvadorian food. We needed a central location, so I did a quick Yelp search and selected this one based on its rating alone without checking any details. When we got there, I was surprised to find it in the food court of a Latino mall, but the ratings did not lie-- the food is delicious. The pupusas are excellent; we tried cheese (my favorite) and meat. They came out piping hot and their cabbage slaw was on-point. We also got fried plantains with crema and beans. Drool. So good.  Pros: -Delicious food made fresh. -Cheap.  Cons: -If you're looking for a quiet sit-down restaurant, this is not the right place for you. It is in a noisy mall food court. -The food takes awhile to come out. -Location can be inconvenient if you don't live nearby."}
{"text":"For the Best Pupusas in Arizona,  come to San Salvador Restaurant,  very Friendly Staff,  they are inside the Desert Sky Mall on 75TH av and Thomas Rd...  They also have two mo restaurant in Mesa,  Total Of 5 including one in Riverside Ca.  They get 5 stars for seving the tastiest Salvadoran food in AZ."}
{"text":"Just happened to notice this place as I was leaving the food court. We did because we are going to try El Salvador food when we take our trip to California. We have never had it before and we were curious. Everything on the menu looks really good. So we just decided to pick up a papusa. These looked popular because I would u of see people ordering and walking away with several on plates.  The nice girl that works at the counter did tell us the popular papusa was the bean cheese and pork and of course I ordered 1 to go.  She was also nice enough to say that it takes 8 minutes to make I was totally fine with that.  Now to the papusa ...it's a delicious flattened circle of masa filled with beans cheese and pork fried and seasoned to perfection it is served with a side of slaw like salad. I will give 4 stars now hopefully I can give 5 when I go back. And you have guess a the food is authentic if you see people from the old school in groups lining up to eat there."}
{"text":"When traveling to a Papusa Festival we were halted by the sheer volume of people in the small parking lot the festival was catered at. So with that said, we hit the Yelp for the closest Salvadorian Food Joint.   Like other reviews have said, the wait is a little long however the set up is to blame in my opinion. Food court setting in a rat race Sunday night shopping day weighed the experience down however the food is worth the wait. As you can see with my picture we ordered almost everything on the menu. It was all fantastic, the Papusas were spot on and even better than other \"highly rated\" Salvadorian Food Joints around the valley. I would recommend enjoying the wait, be patient, the light is bright at the end of the tunnel. Price is low, taste is high, wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Hard to find, as the first 2-3 clerks in the mall had not heard about it.  Best way to find the small shop, is to ask for the food court.  Be ready to wait for your food as it is prepared after you order.  I noticed some people ordered ahead and showed up to pick it up.  Food was ok.  But the low prices earned another star. Doubt that we'll go back.  Next time we'll probably try another pupusa place."}
{"text":"I love this place. Go there a few times a month. The mix papusa is the best. The staff are always helpful and kind and I am so thankful I found this place. My friend has gotten their beef and chicken soup as well. She prefers the beef but they are such hot sellers you have to get there early in order to get it."}
{"text":"Awesome food here! (If you like salvadorian food of course) The employees are nice and helpful and fast on serving, their popusas and ceviche is BOMB  They give a pretty good amount of food per plate. The price of meals is reasonable and not too pricey either."}
{"text":"Best pupusas in all Phoenix . I've tried many of them and this place is the best hands down. A pupusa has pork and cheese inside or just cheese (WHICH IS HOW I ORDER MINE) its not plain or just cabbage.Regardless of it being inside the mall everyone is friendly, portion is great and prices are reasonable. The food is made fresh. everytime I order it's hot and I can tell it hasn't been sitting out. Love this place. There is a salvadorian restaurant outside the mall by planet fitness...that can't even compare."}
{"text":"Food was good just not worth 35 minutes for two pupusas! I asked for my money back after asking several times of food was done and refused to do so. For that wait it's not worth it and horrible customer service."}
{"text":"The pupusas are definitely worth the wait. The masa has a perfect texture that I can only imagine is a result of a slow cook. Would highly recommend."}
