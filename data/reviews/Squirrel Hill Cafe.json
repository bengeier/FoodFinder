{"text":"AWESOME HANG OVER FOOD.   good drink prices and really good comfort food at great prices.  The service is cool.    Note that there is smoking inside so you'll either a. love that information or b. hate that information."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in on a whim and each got a cheeseburger. Honestly we were expecting a typical thin patty burger with more toppings than meat but were pleasantly surprised. They were thick, messy, and actually made-of-beef burgers. Really filling too- I could only eat half. One note on the ambiance- the place was neat looking inside however it is a smoking friendly bar. The smoke was so overwhelming due to a lack of windows or fresh air that we planned on eating in but ordered to go because there was no way we could eat in the cloud of smoke."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. The waitress is rude, as well as the guy near the bar. I think they are kind of racist. whcih do not like or hate asian people. Unhappy memory. I will never ever go there again."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a better review. The Cafe was pleasantly full, great tunes, and the waitress was friendly and attentive. Unfortunately we (a table of 2) waited 45 min for our food to never come out while seeing a table of 5, who came in 20 min after us, get served first. The waitress was apologetic but her continued \"your food is coming out next\" assurance lost credibility when she had to repeat it twice and then servered the table of 5 was first."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night around 9-ish, after getting out of a movie around the corner. I have only been in Pittsburgh for a few weeks, so I thought it was a good opportunity to try a new place out.   When we walked in we went straight to the bar and was greeted by the bartender almost immediately.  In total we had 5 drinks: 2 red wines, 1 Jack & Coke, & 2 Draft beers and the total was $18. I thought that was a totally reasonable price compared to Atlanta (where I moved from).  I also looked at the menu and the prices were super cheap.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It is a special place for me :) Cheap, good, fast. Pick two? No, you've got it all here. Super chill crowd.Squirrel Hill is just a super chill neighborhood and diverse, too. I'd say the NYC of PGH. LOL."}
{"text":"Best cheeseburger for the money I've had, hands down! Super cheap food and beers, actually a good selection of beers too. The guy that cooks in the evenings always cooks the burger perfectly. I had one during the daytime once and it was a little overcooked but still delicious. Highly recommend this place. The only downfall is the smoking and that I have to immediately wash my clothes after leaving."}
{"text":"I love the Cage. They have the best bar food in the city and great prices. I enjoy playing pin ball here and the Rolling Rock pony bottles. The only negative is the smoking. It can get pretty smoky here on a busy night."}
{"text":"Super good eats for cheap. The place is kind of a dump but that only adds to the charm. I lived in Pittsburgh for 10 years and frequented this establishment probably a bit too much. I miss the place terribly."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere...albeit a bit crowded.  however, that's merely a testament to the bar's reputation.  i used to frequent the squirrel cage in the 90's a bit, so stopping in to wet my whistle a couple months ago brought back fond memories of gin and tonic (many, many of them), and a killer juke box (yeah, that's right san francisco i said JUKE BOX).  long live the cage.  i plan to stop in whenever i visit the 'burgh."}
{"text":"HI QYPE, LEARN HOW TO SPELL PITTSBURGH!    What an awesome neighborhood joint. As an out of towner I was lucky to get taken here! No frills food, drinks and company. Great jukebox with a wide selection and lovely waitresses that don't ask if you want another drinkthey ask if you want another pitcher.    It's set on the main strip in the neighborhood and has a great feel. Even my first time here I felt super comfortable, nice dive bar feel without being superdivey.    Make sure and tag the chalkboard in the womens bathroom, much mor civilized than a sharpie!"}
{"text":"Good, affordable food and a large drink selection. Smoking is permitted inside this establishment.... The cigarette smoke is my biggest complaint with this business."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered take out from here a few weeks ago.  We got burgers and fries.  For such a humble meal, it was outstanding.  We were hungry for nonsense burgers and that's what we got.  The burger was juicy, the bun wasn't huge, and they had all the fixins that we wanted.  The fries were the perfect size, weren't too salty or greasy, and were delicious.  I don't think we would eat at the cafe simply because it is a smoking establishment and we don't smoke...but for take out - YES!"}
{"text":"The Cage rules. I'll agree with Zoe P 100% -- screw the cheesy themed clubs and bars, and get down to it at the Cage. The only \"frills\" it has is an online jukebox and some video poker that looks like it's been there since the 80s.  The food is greasy and cheap and fabulous with a beer. Prices are great on pitchers, and the selection is not too bad. Weeknights are actually better here -- on weekends you better get in and get a table early if you want to sit."}
{"text":"The Cage is the most vibrant bar in Squirrel Hill, with the possible new exception of the Independent Brewing Co., but the two don't really overlap in purpose or atmosphere. It's a smoking dive with patient and friendly staff and a wild mix of customers. You might wait a while for service at busy points--it's not a heavily staffed place and the drinks and food are cheap.   Billy the bartender is a staple of the establishment and is well known for his jolly attitude, willingness to light up your smoke, and friendly and generous patronage of local businesses. The old guard of serving staff have always been on top of things even while the bar was busy, and the new staff seems to be merging quite well into the mix. Kudos.   The Cage has always seemed like a sort of social equalizer to me. The patrons all talk to one another and congregate loosely, and it's a good place for casual conversations among friends or whoever is around. Even if you're not a regular, you'll likely see someone you know every time you stop by.   Non-smokers who can't stand smoke--don't bother. Otherwise, it's a really damn cool place. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"been here several times.  Good food, cold beer and great prices."}
{"text":"I guess I am not a fan of dive bars.  They have the pre-requisits:  cheap beer, smokey room, and loud.  When I visited it was busy, very busy.  Lots of jostling and that sort of thing.  Patrons were in a good mood though.  I just can't get over how smoky it was.  Coming from a city that has banned smoking in bars it was a big turn off.   The wait staff was moderately attentive.  The decor was a bit boring.  I would come back but I won't make a point of it."}
{"text":"Good food. A burger with pepper jack cheese is a craving I get monthly. I used to be here every night when I lived within stumblng distance. The bartenders are all friendly, unless you are a dick. Sunday at 6pm is my favorite time to hop on a stool, order some wings well done, hot. And cram filthy $5's into the Jukebox."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in the burgh! Bartenders are fun and knowledgeable, servers are sweet, fast and attentive. Drinks are phenomenal and reasonably priced, and a wide beer selection. The food is also great... My go to is the cheeseburger, veggie burger, or cheese balls. Gotta check it out!"}
{"text":"Love this bar! Fun crowd and the staff are all incredibly nice. Drinks are affordable and the food is VERY cheap. I had a burger and it was quite tasty."}
{"text":"This place is grossly over priced! Also, the bartender took her own tip from my money when paying for my drink! I will NEVER come back here!!!!"}
{"text":"Despite the smokiness, this place is and probably always will be my favorite bar in Pittsburgh.  A fun, unpretentious, laid-back environment in the otherwise fairly unexciting neighborhood of Squirrel Hill.  In fact, I'm pretty sure the Squirrel Hill Cafe (aka the Squirrel Cage) and Jerry's Records will be the only thing I miss about the area."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just popped in for drinks but the bar has a great atmosphere, plenty of seating, a great location, friendly staff and great prices on drinks. They make their mixed drinks strong, which we love. The food looked good too but we didn't have order any. We got everything we were looking for and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to enjoy this neighborhood landmark, but it disappointed on all points:   Small pours Slow service Food that never arrived Indoor Smoking  This place makes me want to order in and drink at home."}
{"text":"oh how I wanted to love this place. It just wouldn't let me.  I like crowded bars sometimes but not when i can't get to the bar, or in to the bathroom. The beer was cheap though. YAY cheap beer."}
{"text":"A pretty big beer selection for guys plus a lot of fruity liquors for girls, a no-frills food menu that includes pretty decent fries, and zero pretentiousness means that this is a fair to good place to catch up with friends.  The smoke gets annoying after a while, which is really my only gripe.  But other than that - A-OK."}
{"text":"Affectionatly referred to as 'the squirrel cage', the squirrel hill cafe rules. It's got a relaxed atmosphere, cheap food, cheap beer, and decent surroundings. The crowd is often odd, with some random creepy people at the bar, often gatherings of older folks at the early side of the evening, and as it gets late lots of alternative college-aged kids roll on in. It's good times. Have a few pitchers, stumble home and you'll be back at the squirrel cage."}
{"text":"I must have missed something the other reviews got about the Squirrel Cafe. Granted, we stopped in for lunch on Saturday so maybe it is more interesting in the evening. It struck me as a diner with a bar in it. The food was mediocre (homemade cheese dip is not cheese you put in salsa and melt in the microwave) and the pepperoni roll, while good, was tiny. Beer selection in bottles was good but the draft selection was limited. The Squirrel Cafe seemed like a little mom and pop place. Character can only get you so far. You need to have a reason to come back and, for me, neither the food or the beer selection was enough."}
{"text":"I had one of the funnest nights out with a friend here once. Since then, I've had hit and miss nights. First of all, for anyone planning to stop in here, this is one of THE smokiest bars in the city. I'm not a smoker, so when I go out I at least like to know what I'm getting into (and realizing that my clothes will be unwearable the next day). However, this place is a hole in the wall on Forbes in Squirrel Hill, and it's a great place to grab some friends, grab a booth, and grab a pitcher or two for a night. I'm not sure if they still do this, but they use to have board game nights where a different game is placed at each booth.  Board games + beer = perfect night of fun. I've had some good bar food there as well, and from I remember it's not too pricey. There is a great selection of bottled beer, and a pretty average tab variety. I do remember the service not being incredible, but as long as you're with your peeps and do pitchers, you'll be happy. The wood booths and tables give the bar a homey, smokey feel. There is also an upstairs that is open from time to time if the place gets crazy. I've had trouble before finding a booth open on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Best damn late-night food in the burgh.  Except for maybe this one Ethiopian place in the South side.  But that's beside the point.  Definitely divey, and there is no non-smoking area.  The food is immaculate.  Sausage dip is pretty bomb, but the deep fried pepperoni rolls are the true treasure at this spot.  I'm a fan of the Squirrel cage sandwich (turkey, ham, maybe some other meat but I can't be sure).  Mmm.  Cheap, too.    It's the kind of spot that you can get drunk in, eat, and then continue to drink.  Hell yeah."}
{"text":"Such a cute and intimate place to just grab some food/drinks and chillax. Prices are extremely reasonable and service is efficient. Great for group hangouts!  I'm not much of a drinker so I don't really know about their drink specials, but I am a devoted consumer of food so I'll just get straight to the point! Sandwiches here are amazing and really satisfy that burning hunger. I highly recommend their burgers and load it with mushrooms for an additional quarter. When you get a burger...you get a REAL burger. I don't mean those fake factory patties...I'm talking about a thick chunk of juicy beef sandwiched between soft fluffy buns. Their spinach artichoke dip is quite tasty as well. The one thing I don't really like here is their fries...way way way too greasy to the point where it doesn't even taste like potatoes anymore."}
{"text":"Ordered their chef salad for my lunch takeout and MAN when i tell you this salad was the freshest salad I've had in this area i mean it! I work a few blocks up on Forbes and it's hard finding a restaurant to give you GOOD food. This one is definitely it! I will for sure be going back to this place for lunch!"}
{"text":"A great casual bar/eating with cheap food/drinks but even if you have a suit one you can fit. I guess that's the best thing about this bar. You met all kind of people.  The food is really good (always got on the burgers side), the beer cheap, the waitresses nice.  You clothes smell like an ashtray but who cares? you spent a great night!"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks or to socialize.  Lots of seating around the bar plus tables and booths.  Always a busy joint and they have tons of tvs playing sports to make things better the bar food is cheap and tasty.  If i could id give this place 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"When I was a kid growing up in Squirrel Hill, the Cage was a place of mystery for us. Who knew what went on behind those dark windows? It was probably a den of iniquity where things too terrible to talk about went on. You weren't allowed to go in and use the BATHROOM. WHY WEREN'T YOU ALLOWED TO WALK IN OFF THE STREET AND USE THE BATHROOM??? IT MUST BE A TERRIBLE PLACE.  When I went to art high school (this was before they started carding), all the coolest teachers used to drink there, and sometimes we'd come in to talk to them on Friday nights and pretend we were cool and old enough to be sitting in the old wooden booths smoking cigarettes. And then suddenly, we *were* old enough to be in the booths smoking and drinking enormous pitchers of Yuengling (or double old-fashioneds for those of us who still had pretensions towards being literary) and stumble out at the end of the night heading for Eat n' Park and smelling like the inside of a cigarette (though my allergies have gotten a lot worse of late and I'm actually starting to wish you couldn't smoke in here--I am getting old!) This is a good bar to come to on a pre-Christmas December night to hang out with friends you haven't seen in ages, and know that tons of people you know will be drifting in and out as the night goes on. This is a good bar to come to when you don't really know where you want to go on a Friday but you know you want to just relax. This is a good bar for women to not get grossly hit on in. This is a good bar to people-watch in--it's always a crowd of middle-aged drunks, university intellectuals, and other fun neighborhood types hanging around in here. It's not the cleanest bar in the world, nor the friendliest (though the bartender with the ZZ Top beard whose name I can't remember is pretty damn great), but it's just a straightforward place where what you see is what you get.    It's not for everyone. It's definitely for me.   (Also, I hear their burgers are good, but I've never eaten here, lol)"}
{"text":"The Squirrel Hill Cafe was a pleasant surprise of a bar. I usually never ventured into squirrel hill to imbibe, but my friend had a birthday gathering there on a sunday evening.  This place is another Pgh dive-gem. The beer selection is marvelous, and the jukebox is too. Yes, you can smoke in here, which turns away most of the people I would not want to talk to anyways.  Quite an eclectic mixture of folks, as someone else mentioned.   Yes, I was THAT person who had to look around for the Squirrel \"Cage\" while parked in front of the SHC for a good five minutes."}
{"text":"It's a smoking bar, and I'm not a smoker... but this place is worth the possible lung cancer. I don't come too often because of the smoke, but it's a great place to just chill and talk to some locals around the area. Bartenders are nice, people are friendly, and most importantly drinks and food are good and CHEAP."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. They have a great beer selection, wonderful bar food, solid service and are very reasonably priced.   The only down side is that they allow smoking everywhere, which can be a problem for some people. Otherwise, it would've gotten five stars!"}
{"text":"Great place with an incredible selection of beer. The crowd is very diverse and the food is good. I would recommend stopping by this place."}
{"text":"\"The Cage\" has cheap, decent food, and reasonably priced drinks -- though for the divey atmosphere, they're probably a little overpriced. It's smoky as Hell, so don't wear your finest outfit (unless, I guess, it includes a smoking jacket). The service is generally lacking if you're not right at the bar, but that is more a staffing issue, as there's usually only one waitress for the whole place. If you like old boardgames and don't mind hipsters, I recommend checking out their Game Night on Tuesdays. I mean, come on; free rounds of 1986 Trivial Pursuit? Can't be beat."}
{"text":"Ahh, the Squirrel Cage. Many a shameful evening has started here. This used to be my neighborhood bar and thus I have some ingrained loyalty...but beyond that the drinks are cheap, the bartenders are friendly, and it kind of has that Cheers feeling (everyone knows your name). If you want anonymity and live in the Squirrel Hill area, don't come here. You will run into everyone and their mother and its not a place for a quiet drink. The guy at the next bar-stool will talk to you or the table next to you will invite you to join them on a Ritters trip. Not much of a pick-up bar (thankfully) but just a really friendly place. Squirrel Cage is definitely not for the snobby or standoffish, but if you want to meet some locals and are up for joining strangers on an adventure, head over and grab a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"a great local bar with a good beer selection and tons of seating.   not quite a dive bar, but has that comfortable feeling that lends itself well to just sitting and hanging out.  would avoid the karaoke nights, but beyond that you can't hate too much on a place with the nickname of the \"SQUIRREL CAGE.\""}
{"text":"I think I figured out why this place is called The Cage.  There's no concrete evidence that what I observed here is true.  You walk in and you see a mix of people that would represent different classifications of people you'd see throughout Pittsburgh.  Each booth and table is a different subset of the population.  Every booth and table is an exhibit or cage at a zoo, there for you to observe how each group interacts with one another.  Err, what am I saying?  Maybe I just enjoyed myself so much here that I started spacing out. I mean you do get to see a wide mix of the human race interacting in here, but who cares, they are all there for one thing, to have a good time.    Whether you are sitting at the bar or pick a booth along the wall, the staff are there to make sure you have a libation nearby.  Always able to make a suggestion if you want to try something new.   The music touch has a nice mix of music to fulfill anyone's need to hear tunes. But who needs tunes when you can just sit there and chat the whole night?  I'm still skeptical about going up to the loft area. It looks so small from down below.  Such a nice intimate place to go and grab a beer with friends.  It's a great place to sit and blow off some steam.  Beer selection is pretty good.  They have their fair share of seasonal blends, as well as"}
{"text":"What's not to like about the Squirrel Cage?  It's not a theme bar, you'll not find any cheesy decor or anything fancy that matter.  It's simply a great neighborhood place.  As other posters say, it's a place to have good, cheap, greasy food and a beer (okay, so I'm primarily a non-drinker).  It's a great place to people watch too because here you see people as they really are.  They come here and they act like themselves and aren't putting on an act like at some lame club."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The first time was on a Friday night for some drinking time. It was pretty fun...cheap drinks...Although I hated our server. My friends go there frequently and say that she's always awful. I LOVE that you can smoke in here. It's a big place too so the smoke never gets unbearable.   I went again a couple days ago INCREDIBLY hung over for lunch. It dun me good. Started off with the spinach and artichoke dip which was really good. Then I got the meatball sandwich which was just eh...The meatballs were a little overcooked. The fries weren't that great, super chewy.   There was a great vegetarian selection and my friend said his veggie burger was awesome.   Everyone enjoyed their food and it was super duper cheap."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker it had been a LONG time since I had been in a bar where you could smoke.  Even as a non smoker, it certainly does bring a different vibe with it, and sometimes it's welcome one.  Certainly brought back memories.    Cool crowd, good music, and a great selection of beer that you normally don't find at rando dive bars.  Like Young's Double Chocolate, or Sierra Nevada Porter, Great Lakes beers, etc.  The only downside, not a great selection on tap.  One thing I love about my dive bars is the taps.  This place severely lacked.    Other than that, the bottled beer is the only thing that really stuck out, otherwise it's an average to slightly above average dive."}
{"text":"Love this place - convenient location (great to unwind after a day of working in the library), good, filling food that doesn't leave you feeling sick, smoking permitted, and of course, reasonably priced beer, including my favorite, Blue Moon, on tap."}
{"text":"Me likey the hot wings.  I started to frequent this place a few years ago when I was living in the neighborhood and taking the summer to goof off and do very little more than eat and drink my way around Pittsburgh. The Squirrel Hill Cafe helped me do that on the reg. We actually called it the Squirrel Cage-- it throws me off to call it a cafe. I am reading that this place is becoming quite the hip spot, and I don't know how to feel about that, but I am sure it's integrity is still there.  When it was my spot, it was sometimes dark and a little on the empty side, but I found a lot of entertainment watching the guy come out of the kitchen and smoke while he complained about bunions and whatnot.  Every once in a while the place will go off and there will be mostly standing room, and the vibe was always good. I hope they stay cool."}
{"text":"Without a doubt my favorite dive bar in the Pittsburgh area. Food and alcohol are both low priced and well made - when we lived in Squirrel Hill there this was our #1 spot to meet up with friends on a Friday night. The cheese fries are insanely good, and I was never disappointed with my mixed drinks. Be advised that you will more than likely leave smelling like cigarette smoke - never bothered us much, but I can see how that could be an issue for some people."}
{"text":"My grad school advisor recently warned me that I should stay away from this place. So when one of his students suggested that I check it out with him at 1AM, my answer was quick and predictable. :)  When we got there, the place had a very nice energy for 1AM. Like someone else said - divey, but not divey in the \"I hope that guy doesn't come over here\" way. No, more divey in the \"Hey, this waitress actually seems kind of cool without being a hipster douche\" way. (Yes, I know that's her job, but it's nice to see people doing their job well.)  We came there to have one drink, but wound up having more - and ordering more than you expected is nearly always a good sign. We had something that billed itself as \"The Official State Beer of China\", which tasted suspiciously like apple juice but at $2 a bottle left us with no complaints. All in all, I approve. It seemed they had very few drinks on tap - so I'll hold off on the the fifth star until I check out their full fridge selection and/or try their food - but for now, it seems like a nice \"standby\" for a weekday drink."}
{"text":"I love the Cage!  I didn't go there nearly enough in my Pgh. heyday, but I got a visit in every couple of weeks.  The grilled cheese sandwich is killer.  Last time I checked, the jukebox was pretty great, too.  A fun place to crowd into a booth with your friends and b.s. for a while."}
{"text":"Good bar burgers and very friendly service. Guy at the bar is really good at remembering who you are making this place have a very comfortable hangout atmosphere. Salads are just kind of okay...but it is a smallish and not so expensive bar so that's to be expected. Good selection of beer. Sports games are often on when I've been. The place has a very Pittsburgh \"feel\". Sometimes seating gets crowded."}
{"text":"What can I say about The Cage that others haven't already said, based on my lone visit last night at 6?  I don't know, but for the sake of brevity, I'll sum up my visit with a pro-con list.  Pros: 1. Cheap, decent food.  My BLT ($4.25) was delightful, with crispy, juicy bacon and crisp, fresh lettuce--only the hothouse tomatoes disappointed.  Get the fries--they're hand-cut and delicious!  I tried some from a companion, and regretted not upgrading to a platter to get them.  2. I can't comment on the drinks myself, since I'm not drinking at present, but everyone says they're good--and they're cheap, too.  I got a club soda ($1.25).  3. Interesting people watching opportunities.  I wasn't able to take advantage of them due to concentrating on group discussion with my table mates, but the bits and pieces that I saw and overheard were amusing.  Cons: 1. Smoky.  If you're sensitive to cigarette smoke, don't come here!  When I first entered, I thought I might be okay with it, but then the table next to ours started smoking.  I could smell smoke on myself for the rest of the night until I changed and showered.  2. Slow service.  Our waitress wasn't the swiftest or the most friendly, and it took 20 min. to get my BLT.  Getting change took way too long, too.  3. $10 credit card minimum. I suspected this would be the case, so I hit the ATM next door before coming.  Plan accordingly.  Quite honestly, though I enjoyed the food and company, I doubt I'll be back here soon due to the smoke.  Increasing my risk for lung cancer and reeking of eau de cigarette isn't my idea of a fun, relaxing night out.  If you don't mind that and the slow service, though, then by all means, stop by for some inexpensive, delicious food and drinks and take advantage of the interesting people watching opportunities."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the smoke, this would probably be my favorite dive bar of all time.  The food is both cheap and delicious - home cooked is how they aptly describe it. I love the fries and the fried mushrooms. The cheese balls didn't stand the test, but that's probably just because I'm from Wisconsin.  The drinks are cheap and well made. I've enjoyed everything I've ordered there and they have a pretty good beer selection.  The atmosphere is nice. It's comfortable, a bit dark, and it's loud, but not overly so. You can still have a conversation at your table.   I'll be back - but only on nights when I have time to take a shower before bed."}
{"text":"What an awesome neighborhood joint. As an out of towner I was lucky to get taken here! No frills food, drinks and company. Great jukebox with a wide selection and lovely waitresses that don't ask if you want another drink...they ask if you want another pitcher.   It's set on the main strip in the neighborhood and has a great feel. Even my first time here I felt super comfortable, nice dive bar feel without being super...divey.  Make sure and tag the chalkboard in the womens bathroom, much more civilized than a sharpie!"}
{"text":"It is a smoking bar with a bad ventilation system.  I've been to smoking bars before but this was too much.  Their fries are freshly cut and AMAZING though!!!  Their upstairs area is basically a mezzanine/supply closet where if you are taller than 5'5 you'll hit your head.  If it wasn't for the smoke I would come here more often."}
{"text":"Squirrel Hill Cafe AKA \"the Cage\" can be a good time. This is primarily a student, hippy, hipster, old regulars, and local randoms who live near here spot. They sell decent priced pitchers and broadcast the games. It does get incredibly packed at times.   A solid neighborhood bar where you can sit at the jukebox and pick the tunes you feel like head bopping to. I always end up putting something on like MGMT or Florence and the Machine, I get weird looks when a soulful jazzy soprano starts belting into the room. I'm usually in my own world at that point but you have to love those \"you can find any song you can think of music machines\"  I sure do!  I like pulling up to the bar next to a young college bloke and ordering two fingers of bourbon neat, that's always an eye opener from the Punky Brewster girl with the mouse voice sitting next to you. The bartenders are attentive and so are the servers when you are sitting at the tables.   There is an upstairs room but the ceiling is crazy low, must just be made for the Shawties! I really like that the booths have such high backs so if you are having an intense conversation you can hide in there!  One last thing, this is a smoking bar so if that bothers you don't visit, your clothes will be reeking by the end of the night! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best bar in squirrel hill. Billy the bartender is awesome and personable. Cozy booths, good prices, walking distance. A+"}
{"text":"Ahh, the Squirrel Cage. This hole in the wall in Squirrel Hill is perfect for a cheap, smoky dinner, or an evening of a few pitchers with friends.   From what I understand, this spot is legendary. It's an old school dingy dive with a dark interior. If you're looking for a low-key place to get a drink and a burger and come out smelling like an ashtray, this is it. Yes, you can still smoke here, and every time I have went, there's been a plethora of active smokers. You are gonna stink, but it's worth it.   The menu boasts a surprisingly decent draft list. Last time I grabbed a Victory Hop Devil and thought there was a mistake on the tab--it was such a deal. The burgers and sandwiches all fall around $5. \"How do they do this,\"you ask? I don't ask, because the burgers are some kind of straight up delicious witchcraft.   The whole experience is just a steal across the board. After paying the check, I left like I'd gotten away with something, it's that cheap. But, there is a trade off when it comes to visiting the Squirrel Cage--it's laughably slow. There was one poor overworked server in the entire bar, and the kitchen was backed up to the point that it took a little under an hour for hamburgers. There was some confusion on beers as well. I was served a drink meant for another table.   So with that grain of salt, I implore you to be patient and have a good long visit to the Squirrel Hill Cafe."}
{"text":"Oddly enough, this place has the best burgers in town. The wait staff and bartenders are excellent and the beer selection is great. One of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh hands down. Get there early enough to grab a seat.  It can get unbearably smoky later in the evening, but that can be lessened by grabbing a seat near the front."}
{"text":"If the Squirrel Cage was a human woman, my god, the things I would do......She might be a smoked out slouch with a voice like an alcoholic midget, but she's still beautiful to me. My fondness of this place is rooted in more than a few sinful nights (accompanied by local Squirrel Hillian Marni K) spurred on and exponentiated by the cheapness the strength and the quality of their booze, the quality and friendliness of the patrons and staff, and a jukebox that has a selection that'll make any music lovers wallet a barren wasteland. Everything I've ever taken from this place I've given back to Pittsburgh, usually on a friends bathroom floor near but not in the toilet.    I don't care to get into details about this place, you'll either love it or you won't. It's an old gem of a place that is pretty much my first stop in the city every single time I go."}
{"text":"I come here often, usually around happy hour, and occasionally late night.   Most of the time, the food is really good. I especially like the grilled chicken salad (good deal), the jumbo fish (battered, as opposed to the breaded \"extra large\" they offer, and so infinitely better), and Cage club (capicola, turkey, cheese, delicious). However, the prices have risen from unfathomably dirt cheap to only pretty cheap. Be aware that you will pay extra for fries instead of chips, and that the fries are sometimes so overcooked that any potato inside has turned to dust. Wings are real good, but only the most basic sauces. Every once in a while, your food will just not be that good. Can't find a rhyme or reason to it, but it's good often enough that I keep coming back, and never so bad that it's awful. Just not as good as normal.  As far as drinks go, the Yuengling pitcher is an economical and delicious choice. I can never remember when or what the specials are, but they often have out-of-season seasonals in the bottle case for real, real cheap. It's worth asking.   And once it's late and your drunk, there is nothing like their Long Island to take you to new and undiscovered levels of intoxication."}
{"text":"Lots of room...hazy memories but the service must have been good. Had a blast. Extra star for allowing smoking!"}
{"text":"Psst... Over here: despite being a bar, not a cafe, and technically not even a restaurant, this packed little dive bar has one of the best, and almost certainly cheapest burgers in town.  The drinks are cheap and the atmosphere is jovial.  The bartenders are real Pittsburgh characters.  That said, I'd never have come in here, except it's a smoker's paradise, and while I don't smoke, I have friends who do.  Walking into the Squirrel Cage (as it really goes by) is like walking into an ashtray.  Seriously, if you know anyone with asthma, don't bring them here.   The first time I came, I was starving.  A friend told me that I had to try the burger.  Based on the price, I think $3 for the burger and another $2 for fries, I ordered two cheeseburgers.  My friend and everyone around me looked at me like I was crazy.  When the burgers came out, I could see why.  For the price, or even triple as much, these are some big burgers, and additionally, they're delicious.    Apparently, they can't make more than a certain percentage off food without being categorized as a restaurant, at which point they could no longer allow people to smoke, so the burgers, and all other food are essentially loss-leaders.  Despite people's incredulous stares, I polished off both burgers.   If you're a smoker, or a non-smoker who is prepared to remove all of your clothing and put them in a sealed bag immediately after leaving, or just burn them, then this a burger you don't want to miss."}
{"text":"Was super pissed about Beer selection. Wouldn't call  This place \"hip\" EVER."}
{"text":"This place is always hopping with hipsters. I mean every single night it's packed with chain smokers, heavy drinkers, people working on their art, or writing in the corners. And that's what makes it cool. That \"I don't give an F that it is a Monday night, I'm still staying out until last call\" sort of vibe.   The cage has a great beer selection with alright prices. They serve food, but I've never tried it. Everyone around me is always eating though, so it must be good. That, or it is just cheap, and artists got to eat ya know?   There is always good music playing and the bartender (the guy with the long beard) is great. He knows everyone by name and doesn't hesitate to strike up a conversation.   Great place to check out on any night, just expect to smell like a stale cigarette when you leave."}
{"text":"Pretty chill, I feel like it's understaffed because there seemed to be only one waitress waiting on the whole cafe.  This made the whole get in, get out process a lot longer.    The fries were really greasy (I don't know what I was expecting) and I wasn't a fan of putting the vinegar fry combo either.  I went for the classic Heinz ketchup instead.  We felt especially ravenous and got a artichoke and spinach dip as well which was filled with huge pieces of artichoke hearts (mmm) - definitely something I'll get again.   I got the Extra large fish and loved every bite! I'm easy to please when it comes to fried fish.  It came with a side of potato chips, the kind you get from the bag. My friends were not impressed and did not touch theirs, but I cleaned my plate and theirs."}
{"text":"Almost perfect. If you live in Squirrel Hill, there's no excuse for drinking and driving. This bar is easy to walk to, and it's on a great bus-line too.  Squirrel Hill may not have a raging bar scene, but it has the Cage and what more do want, really? Some stupid themed lounge? Brightly colored cocktails? Overpriced bar food that is pretending to be some sort of cuisine? If so, you know where to find them. If not, try the Squirrel Cage.  It's the kind of place where, depending on the day of the week and the time of evening, you can show up with a pack of cards and a group of friends and chill.  Or you can come a little later and enjoy a slightly louder, more crowded atmosphere.  The beers are good, and cheap. The food is cheap. Period. On second thought, an order of lousy onion rings never hurt anyone. But \"Cafe\" is maybe a misnomer.  It'd be nice if Uncle Sam's stayed open later and you could bring your sandwich and/or fries here. How brilliant would that be for (oh, rare pleasure!) late night eats in Squirrel Hill?"}
{"text":"We hit the Squirrel Cage last night for something different. While we normally don't go to bars to eat and drink, this was a good change and I'm glad we did.   Not only is everyone friendly that works there, they have a great selection of beers and a perfect line up of bar food.  We tried a little bit of everything because we'd not been there before. Hot pepper cheese balls with marinara(marinara is must with them), a few garlic wings which were some of the crispest and hottest(temperature) wings we'd ever eaten. Of course we had to try a basket of fries too. They were hot and fresh.  Ah, but the star of the show, the burgers! She had a cheeseburger with grilled mushrooms and onions with cheddar cheese and loved it. I myself had a cheeseburger with pepper jack and all the fixin's.  Service was good, folks were friendly but most of all the food was top notch!"}
{"text":"This place is over flowing with character and has very affordable, tasty food and beer.  One of the best bars in Squirrel hill. Try the fish sandwich.  Can't beat for $5."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting, and I fell in love! This place is like the dive bar in Squirrel Hill, that will make you yearn to return and become a regular.The waitress was truly like a waitress from Cheers, even though she didn't know my name. But I enjoyed her so much. Unfortunately I did not get her name. She is a beautiful brown skin girl with curly fluffy hair, and comedic sass! LOVED IT! She was so attentive and pleasant. Honestly, she's has got to be one of the best waitresses that I have ever encountered with her vibrant personality and she is so hospitable.   I have not gone into a bar in a while where it felt so at home. The prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious. I  had the spinach artichoke dip and it was good for bar food. My friends were in love with the burgers.  I cannot wait to get back there and try out more from the menu. WARNING: There is smoking, so if you are intolerant, then it might not be the spot for you., but I don't think it was that bad. Other than that....CHEERS"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch today and I was so happy!  Not only was it cheap, but it was good food and served quickly. I will be a regular here now!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. It's calm and easy to sit back and relax while enjoying my meal after a long day at the office. Much better than the hustle and bustle of downtown."}
{"text":"I would have given this restaurant 5 stars if it was non-smoking or had a non-smoking section. The prices are excellent and you get a big portion of delicious food. I got the steak salad and the fried egg sandwich. Both were phenomenal and huge! The fries are soooo good. My boyfriend got the steak hoagie and loved it. (He didn't even let me try any!) I ended up taking the entire egg sandwich home for breakfast the next day because I was stuffed from my salad. We liked the environment, lots of people there of all ages 21+. Its cozy and we were comfortable on the wooden benches. We also had enough privacy. The only problem was the smoke; the ventilator didn't do much for the smell. If you don't mind smoke, and you like small, cozy bars with good beer and cheap food, then def give this place a try!"}
{"text":"After hearing the raves about this place from my friends, I went for it. Not a fan. The service is SO SLOW. I also was very put off when the waitress told a member of our party to ash her cigarettes on the floor because she didn't know or feel like finding us an ashtray. That's just kind of dodgy to me."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, even board games to play while drinking with friends. However, what gave this a one star rating was the lack of service. We placed an order for drinks and food. Literally did not get the good for 30 minutes. The waitress (the one with glasses)? No where to be seen.   We could have slipped out the door without paying and I'm not even sure anyone would have noticed."}
{"text":"I love this place, mostly because it means I don't have to deal with the oversaturation of bars in the South Side.  The \"squirrel cage\" as some affectionately call it really is my favorite bar in Pittsburgh because it's a little dive-y, but still hip, and has nice booths to sit in where you can just get a cheap pitcher or two and chill with your buds.  It's also great for people watching!"}
{"text":"This is such a difficult review to write.  The cage has really decent cheap food and an excellent selection of reasonably priced beers.  Unfortunately they frequently seem understaffed and it absolutely reeks of cigarette smoke.  Every time I go in I have to immediately wash whatever I was wearing and take a shower.  Even then I can always smell the smoke the next day. If you're a smoker this is a great spot.  If you're not, keep in mind that there is a visible cloud of cigarette smoke when you walk in."}
{"text":"Don't' know what it is about this place but I've been a fan of it for a long time. The burgers are really good, the beer selection is great and the guy behind the bar, Bill, is one of the best in the business.  Maybe it's the nostalgic charm that keeps me coming back. There's even a book written about the bar called Cage Days by Lee Skirboll. My copy just came in this weekend..."}
{"text":"There are no shortage of places to drink in the East End, so I'm not clear on why I would ever return to a place where the bartender treated me like garbage for no apparent reason.  My experience here was a short but admittedly eventful one.  I and a group of co-workers stopped in after hosting a visiting speaker for dinner at Bangkok Balcony right next door.  The downstairs was not super crowded, but there was no table large enough for everyone in our group.  The friendly waitress agreed to open the upstairs for us.  After she brought our round of beers, myself and a colleague realized she hadn't brought us pint glasses for our porters (generally not a beer you want to drink out of a cold bottle).  Rather than waiting for the waitress to come back up, then making her go down and back up the stairs another time, I went downstairs to ask for some glasses at the bar.  First I was just ignored.  For maybe 5 minutes I watched the bartender shoot the shit with some people at the other end of the bar. He was not making drinks or taking orders, just conversing.  Which is fine, except that he looked at me several times and it was obvious I wanted something.  Eventually, someone came out of the kitchen, so I asked this person if he could grab me a couple of pint glasses.  He told me he couldn't, because he's not the bartender, but did go to the other end of the bar to let the bartender know what I wanted.  Several minutes later, the bartender deigned to grace me with his presence.  He began to hand me two pint glasses, then said he needed to see my ID before he could give them to me.  I told him I already had drinks, I just wanted the glasses, and that I'd come downstairs so that the waitress didn't have to make an extra trip.  He said \"No ID? No glasses.\"  Ok, fine.  I'm 35 years old.  I have an ID. I don't look remotely underage, but I can play the bartender-on-a-power-trip game as well as anyone.  So I went upstairs, grabbed my ID, came back down and, after waiting probably another five minutes for him to grace me with his presence again, showed it to him.  Only now he needed *2* IDs, what with there being 2 glasses.  So up the stairs I traipse, back down, and now - I shit you not - now he says \"How many people are up there?  I need to see everyone's IDs.\"  I looked at him in astonishment and said \"I only came down here to save your waitress the trip.  I've now gone up and down the stairs three times.  Everyone up there already has a drink.\"  His reply - seriously - was \"I just can't go serving drinks to complete strangers.\"  I'm sorry, what??  You're a bartender.  It's your JOB to serve drinks to complete strangers.  At this point, I'd had enough. I told him I didn't mind showing an ID, and that I understand people have to do their jobs, but that there was absolutely no reason for him to be a dick about it.  I used those words.  At which point he said, \"Well then you are welcome to leave.\"  So we did.  Our entire group left, and I refused to pay for beers that we didn't get to drink.  The waitress went and talked to the bartender - seeing how upset I was and also seeing that I was not going to give her money for drinks we couldn't actually imbibe.  She came back and told us it was all a misunderstanding and that it was fine if we stayed, that he didn't know that we were her customers, yada yada.  No.  I'm not spending my money in a place that treats people like shit.  While waiting for the bus afterwards, one of my colleagues said that he and another friend had encountered similar hostility from this same bartender before, and had also been \"asked to leave.\"  (I didn't get the bartender's name, but I'm guessing he's the only one working there who looks like he just stepped off the set of Duck Dynasty).  I guess the Squirrel Hill Café does such great business that they don't need any more?  This was my first and last visit to this place.  We were very sorry that the waitress had to pay for the bartender's shit attitude, but hopefully it will spur her to say something to him or to management about the fact that he is running off customers.  What an absolute disgrace."}
{"text":"The Squirrel Hill Cafe or as it is locally called, the Cage is a cool place to grab a beer and watch the Pens play.  The food is incredibly cheap and surprisingly good and the beer is cheap.  I went with a friend recently and had a bacon cheese burger, a giant basket of cheese fries, and a pitcher of Yuengling and my bill was only $15.  I almost died when I saw how cheap it was.  This wasn't my first time there and certainly won't be my last."}
{"text":"In a neighborhood as historic as Squirrel Hill, 'The Cage' (as locals know it) has existed as a similarly stalwart institution.  Famous for its large portions of food, wide selection of beers, and inexpensive prices, it's been the neighborhood's signature haunt for decades.  In a critical light, the food is simple pub affair, and the quality does not hold a distinct edge to other bars' offerings of the same items. But that's not really the point of The Cage. It's more about the function it serves. The meeting of the locals. The neighborhood funnel. Squirrel Hill is known for its varied population, and this establishment has always been a focal point for its gathering.  I'll drink to that."}
{"text":"I smoke when I drink but don't necessarily love being in a super smoky bar. I've been to some smoking dives with noooo type of filter and it's awful. At least this places has a vent/fan type thing but yea, it's still pretty smoky.   Somehow we snagged a booth on a Saturday night... the double vodka/sodas and Stellas flowed seamlessly for the rest of the evening and our bill was only $40 bucks! The kitchen closed right when we decided we wanted food, so that sucked. But I'm glad I didn't read the reviews about how good the food is prior to or we'd have been really bummed. But then again, I watched the cook chain smoke cigs all night long so... gross.   I read someone describe the atmosphere as jovial and that it was. Every table was laughing and having a great time, as was I. Out waitress was super pleasant and funny as well!   This is definitely my kind of dive bar. Although, I greatly dislike single restrooms... but I got lucky in that the line was never too long."}
{"text":"Perfect pub food. Servings are much larger than you'd expect so don't over order! Great beer selection. Very friendly, fast service."}
{"text":"Great local bar with good beer and strong drinks.  It will become your home away from home if you frequent it enough.  Try the cheese balls!"}
{"text":"SMOKING IS ALLOWED! Whether that is a good thing or bad thing for you, it's important to know because this place can get smokey and smelly. When I left the place, my clothes and hair all smelled of smoke. As far as food, their burgers are good but nothing I can really remember and the cheese balls are really good. Drinks are decently priced. Service was a bit slow and even though our waitress was nice, she forgot to give one of our credit cards back until we had to remind her."}
{"text":"Don't smoke-never have. But, if I want to go out smoking is something that has to be dealt with at some bars. If it gets too bad, I just leave. With that said, it's never gotten too terrible for me. Oh how I love the food. There's nothing basic about the taste of this bar food at all. Quite a good selection of beers at this Pittsburgh institution."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. The alcohol--reasonably priced--and the food--even cheaper--which is amazing. Great hole in the wall. I cannot stress enough, even if you don't drink, then go buy some food because it tastes amazing and the prices are easily the cheapest you will EVER find in Pittsburgh. The spinach artichoke dip is homemade, which is the first time in my life I have ever seen a restaurant not just buy industrial dip. Ask for toasted bread with the spinach artichoke dip for a real treat! Recommendations: 1) cheese burger; 2) spicy hot cheese balls :); and 3) spinach artichoke dip. Beware though--I think the kitchen closes at 10 or 11 so place your orders early! The also have a super wide selection of bottled beers to choose from in addition what they have on tap. If you dread the smell of smoke, do not go here. It is a very smokey place at night. During the day, they have the vents on so there is no smoke smell. Also, do not go here if you expect to leave quickly. The service is really slow because the bar does not have enough waitresses. But who cares if you are out with friends casually."}
{"text":"I do not like going there, because there is a lot of smoking in there. I have been cancer free for six month now..."}
