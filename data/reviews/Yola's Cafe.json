{"text":"Excellent waffles.  Excellent place to visit, especially kid-friendly.  Huge selection of Herbal Teas and Coffee is great."}
{"text":"This morning my sister and I went to Yola's for breakfast before work.  I ordered a soy latte.  My sister ordered a frappe. We took our number to a table near the front, and the barrista, a youngish woman with dark hair, brought out my drink after about ten minutes.  This wait was obviously longer than what you would have at a coffee shop such as Starbucks, but because of the independent family-run nature of the business we were understanding of this at first.  My drink was made in a mug instead of a to go cup which would have been fine but like I said.  This was supposed to be just a breakfast stop. My drink tasted good and seemed to be what I ordered. My sister was not so lucky.  After over 30 minutes we really had to leave and she had still not received he drink!  Only about five customers had come through after us.  The workers were very disorganized and even though we had a number for our order the servers kept bringing us items that others had ordered.  Finally I went up to the counter to get a to go cup which the barrista reluctantly gave me.  My sister then asked about her drink.  The barrista, who had taken her order, was very confused about what my sister had ordered and couldn't seem to figure out how to make it even though it was on their menu.  The barrista did not apologize and she was pretty rude.  When she finally handed my sister a drink it was not only not a flavored frappe like she had ordered but a some kind of hot drink which my sister threw away as we left furious.  This is not our first bad experience with Yola's.  We kept going back wanting to like it, and sometimes their food, drinks and service are ok, but enough is enough.  The bad service and sometimes hostile staff ruins any other appeal this place has. Needless to say we will not be going back to Yola's."}
{"text":"Step one: buy a waffle maker.  Step two: charge people for your mediocre waffles.   I think this is Yola's business plan, though I am not certain.  My waffle was nothing special...it was even a little cold when it got to my table. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Yola's is my friendly local coffee shop. I stop here pretty often for breakfast and coffee on the way to work.  The food and pastries are very good! They have a good selection of gluten free items, too. They keep some seasonal items circulating, too. I've always felt very welcomed by the staff, too. The sandwiches are locally sourced and very delicious. The waffles are INSANELY good.  The coffee is good, too. I usually get an espresso beverage, and there can be some difference depending on who is making the drink. The owners are, of course, the best at making the coffee drinks, so if you can catch one of them working behind the counter, do it!  That's the other thing about Yola's I appreciate. It's family owned and run with a good family atmosphere. The owners and their family are often working behind the counter and socializing with the customers. I often see families, friends, and even business meetings going on. Yola's will also host events from time to time, and you can buy items such as jewelry, mugs, and cards from local artisans at the cafe.   The food, beverage, and atmosphere are MUCH better than their corporate counterparts."}
{"text":"Had hire expectations...i think the independent feel of is good. The coffee was not pressed it was just drip coffee. The food menu seemed good but the results were ehh. Pricey for mediocre food. The kid space was the best part. The pastry cabinets need a shinning the glass/plastic was murky.  Not high on our list to return too."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast sandwich!  It's worth getting out of bed for on a Saturday morning. Steaming hot fried egg, a melty cheddar-herb cream cheese with a kick of garlic, and crisp greens on a super fresh, tender ciabatta.   What sets this sandwich apart from the rest is the high quality of ingredients, the freshness of the bread, and the distinctive and flavorful cream cheese.  I'll be back to try more at yola's."}
{"text":"Pros: Kids play area. Cute place. My turkey salad sandwich was pretty tasty.   Cons: Was served with bottom-of-the-bag chip crumbs and meh salsa. Not worth $9. Next time perhaps I'll try a waffle or go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is okay. We were there early in the morning, so we were the only customers. The coffee was way to strong and our food was only lukewarm when we got it. Their Belgium waffle could have been great, but it was not even warm enough to melt the butter they brought with it. I think this place has a lot of potential, but I probably wouldn't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Very friendly server. Very cozy coffe shop atmosphere. Breakfast sandwich was hot and delicious and the coffee is great. Ready to go back and try one of those great looking waffles!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance at Yola's . The veggie sandwich is delicious and gluten free. Cozy spot to meet for coffee or lunch!"}
{"text":"I love going to Yola's for coffee, lunch or brunch - my favorite is Yola's waffles -they are the best! Staff are always welcoming and kind. I am able to relax and enjoy a coffee while having work meetings or working on my computer at Yola's."}
{"text":"I would think twice about the food, but their coffee is very good. Chai latte was great and the brewed organic coffee was brewed to perfection.  Coffee is clearly their core competency."}
{"text":"Yola's is one of those places that you may pass everyday and not realize how perfect it is until you find yourself there to meet up with a friend.   That is my situation. I have gone by this place hundreds of times but had never stopped in until it was suggested as a mutual meeting place. On arrival the space feels very cozy and the the staff was polite. I had the waffles and they were delicious.   Great place with gluten-free items on the menu too!"}
{"text":"Wish staff was friendlier to studying students"}
{"text":"As much as I still love Yola's for its ambiance and great-tasting coffee, unfortunately my last experience there was quite disappointing and felt I needed to update my review.   A friend and I were there on Dec. 30, around noon. We approached the counter to order and were told we'd have to wait a few minutes. No big deal, although they do seem to be consistently understaffed at busier times. We ordered two coffees in mugs and were told they were out of mugs. Again, not a huge deal but couldn't understand how this could be when they always default to paper unless a mug is specified, which isn't often. Sensing my disappointment, my friend found a used mug and handed it to the barista.   We sat down next to a table containing items that previous guests had left behind (two coffee cups and used napkins), despite a nearby trash receptacle and dirty dish station. Why some people can't clean up after themselves is beyond me. However, as another reviewer pointed out and because this is a considerable issue, Yola's needs to have signs reminding people to return used dishes and dispose their trash.   And so we waited. And waited. And waited some more. It was a good 30 minutes before our coffees arrived. I took a sip and it was obvious my latte was not made correctly, requiring a return trip to the service counter. Similar errors have occurred on past visits, making me question their order-fulfillment system. My companion and I lingered for a couple hours, talking and drinking. We were approached at 2pm with an announcement that they would be closing at 2:30. What?? I asked why and was told \"Oh, just because of the holiday and everything.\" Ummm.... what holiday? Mind you, there was no sign on the door or counter area indicating the early closing time, and there were several confused customers still in the shop. Thankfully, we had finished our coffee, but we left baffled and unhappy.  Although Yola's is still a nice, cozy place for coffee/breakfast/lunch, I think they need to work on a few things to improve service and the overall enjoyment of their guests. If the owners are reading, I would also suggest installing blinds or shades on the large expanse of south-facing windows. It's almost impossible to sit near the window on a sunny day, unless you like being blinded. It also gets very hot. Lastly, 4:30 is kind of an odd closing time. Staying open until at least 5 or 6pm seems more reasonable and customers wouldn't feel so rushed."}
{"text":"Very very nice people and the food is fresh and abundant. I am from Dallas and when traveling love to try new places. I highly recommend this place for sandwiches and deserts"}
{"text":"Beautiful place with excellent menu choices, warm family atmosphere, and a passion for people. They bring the food out to you after you order, so you can sit down, relax, talk, or get to work on your computer with their free wi-fi.  Be sure to enjoy a waffle, or get yourself a triple shot of espresso!"}
{"text":"Ambience is cozy and very nice. Their waffles are good not the best , I have had better waffles. I also tried their portobello sandwich which was good.  However service leaves much to be desired. The first time I went it was fine, but in my most recent visit I was there around 4 p.m (they close at 4:30 p.m.) I asked for a waffle and the staff said it will take 10 minutes to make it. I grabbed a coffee and sat there till 4:30 . The waitress came with the waffle boxed, just kept the box in the table and said its late and so she did a carry out and left the table in a hurry.  While I understand she wants to leave work, I was quite disappointed with her attitude and the way she handled it.  I did express my disappointment to her and left the place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a small coffee shop. We usually go there for breakfast and they have a great breakfast sandwich. The waffles are also very good.  The price is slightly higher than I would expect, but the food is still good."}
{"text":"Delicious Coffee and Waffles!  I love stopping in Yola's after working out at the Princeton Club. They have really good iced coffee and the place always smells so good. Once in a while I'll get a waffle, but you have to make sure you have a lot of time because if you order a waffle or speciality coffee it takes a while for them to prepare it."}
{"text":"We were looking for a  place for breakfast/brunch and so glad we found Yola's. My husband got the breakfast sandwich and it was delicious!! My baked oatmeal was wonderful!! We liked the ambience too.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The waffles were good, nothing too fancy. Coffee is generous pour, 50 cents for refills. They have a small kids area to play in while you wait or finish up. You bus your own table. Staff was very friendly. Overall, a nice little breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I visited Yola's Cafe for the first time today with a friend of mine and her two young sons. I loved the vibe of the cafe. They have three sections to sit in with a variety of tables and comfy chairs. The center section has a fireplace which I can imagine being very nice on cooler days!   There was a variety of customers, including business people, young adults, and people with children. The cafe is very family-friendly. We sat at a nice table right by a small play area for the children. I like how the play area is in a corner and provides kids with kitchen-play options, puzzles, books, games, and chalkboards. My friend's sons had a great time and loved the food!   There is a good selection of food and drinks. The food comes out fresh and warm! My friend ordered a waffle topped with strawberries, blueberries, and whipped cream. She and her boys enjoyed it and it was a good amount for the price. I had a breakfast sandwich. It comes on a bagel or english muffin with either sausage, ham, or bacon, along with eggs and cheese. It was delicious! When I go back, I'd like to get a homemade smoothie and one of their lunch sandwiches.   The wall art seemed a little random, but I realized that all of the pieces were designed by the same artist, which I thought was neat. They also had cards, jewelry, and other little things made by local designers for purchase.   Such a nice place! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent cafe' for beverages, food & meetings.  Really appreciate the friendly staff & food selection for a small local cafe'."}
{"text":"Great little cafe! Super fresh, tasty salads and wraps. I have never had their breakfast, but I've heard it's fantastic. I work very close to here, and it's become one of our staple restaurants. They have tons of healthy, food allergy options too. My boss really enjoys their smoothies too.  Very kid friendly, they have lots of toys for those kiddos!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, Good food, nice little area.  Haven't tried out their lunch yet, however looks pretty tasty!  Had to wait in line for a about 10 minutes, but not to bad, good place to have a quick meeting/catch up."}
{"text":"I don't like waffles. I REALLY like Yola's waffles tho. I originally started by ordering a blue berry waffle, but the lady taking my order kindly recommended the strawberries since they are in season(WIN). Fresh strawberries, whipped cream made fresh, and the best waffle I've ever had made for a great breakfast.   My girlfriend and I also ordered coffee, and we were given hot mugs. I counted that as a luxury. Their selection of organic coffee is superb! I especially enjoyed the dark French roast.   Are first time there was a Saturday, they were very busy, well staffed, and just about every table was specially reserved until 10am. We had arrived at 8am, and inquired about the seating; they cleared a table for us with no problem. All of our food came fresh, and in a very timely manner!  -I would say that my only \"negative\" critique would be towards the teenage workers. I would encourage them to be very extroverted towards customers, and to be well-spoken and confident in helping customers have the best experience possible. I definitely do NOT hold this against the entirety of the business tho.  Well done Yola's! We look forward to future visits."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot! I love the waffles, organic eggs, oatmeal and bacon! ... sweet little gem of a place and great bang for the buck!  Updated to: -- remove the comment on the eggs (cook has been consistent and perfectly over easy)  -- add more info on the waffles: the waffle of the month is a great way to donate to a worthy cause and savor a creative and unique waffle (my favorites [so far] were cinnamon roll with cream cheese glaze and pumpkin with pumpkin butter) -- add to the items reviewed: their chili is spectacular -- they make it the same as my favorite/benchmark that few ever rise to; great flavor and texture ...and the Tuscan Ham & Cheese sandwich (on pretzel bread) and homemade chips are now in my repertoire as regulars"}
{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan of breakfast. They advertise serving breakfast, but they don't serve basic breakfast things like omelets. The waffle I had was good, and my girlfriend liked the coffee but didn't like her fritata. The place itself is nicely decorated and welcoming. So, I'd say go there if you're looking for a coffee shop, but look elsewhere if you want breakfast."}
{"text":"I am not one to complain and respect the food industry, however, I was extremely disappointed in my experience here. First, it was extremely crowded and minimal seating. There were only 3 people working and service was poor. My friend and I ordered the frittata and it came extremely runny in the middle. The eggs were barely cooked and the dish was hardly warm. We proceeded to politely tell one of the waitress and they responded telling us they were pre cooked eggs and that it shouldn't be a problem. I however do not feel comfortable eating eggs that appear runny. She then ASKED if we wanted our money back after telling her we would just leave. I'm sorry but it shouldn't have been a question if we wanted our money back, I felt they should have said we will give you your money back or you can pick another menu item for free. After waiting for another 15 minutes we were able to get refunded. again, I don't normally complain or make a scene but the service and food was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Yola's is a great local place to grab some brunch and coffee. The atmosphere is casual and relaxed, w/ Christian-labeled music playing softly in the background. When you come for breakfast, get a Belgium waffle - it's what they're known for. They have gluten-free options too. If you're in the area, give them a visit!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks are inconsistent & the service is almost always poor. Only reason for 2 stars is the gluten free options."}
{"text":"I'm impressed what a great lil café. Black coffee and baked oatmeal and yogurt. The oatmeal is to die for. Its your typical coffee house/café. Its comfortable and wasn't to packed so I was able to just eat and chill. Kinda wishing I would've order a few pastries to go. I'll probably head back for lunch after shopping the menu looks really good"}
{"text":"Great place for coffee, treats and meetings! Yola's has become one of my new places to meet for coffee and work.  They have yummy seasonal specials and of course the coffee is always hot and brewed perfectly. In addition to breakfast fare they have sandwiches, soups and of course their special waffles."}
{"text":"An intimate, local café hidden in the Commerce Drive area. Went around 8:30am, and glad I did as this place gets popular mid-morning/lunch hour with all ages.   The whole menu looked tasty, but this time I opted to build my own breakfast sandwich (who doesn't love their own creation?) of egg white, smoked turkey, oven roasted tomato, avocado, and herb cheese on a flour tortilla. The size seemed on the smaller end but top-notch in taste. Also indulged in a creamy matcha latté - not sure if they have different milk options since I wasn't asked.   Definitely have to return for the delicious looking waffles I was eyeing from another table. Also a plus that Yola's supports local orgs with proceeds from their waffle of the month!"}
{"text":"Just in recently, and had the misfortune of listening to the screams of some ladies leather lunged kid, who was also biting its adult keeper. Consider yourselves warned.  Also, Yola's needs signs placed around to remind customers to please pick up there dishes & place them in the bins against the wall when they are through. I've seen tables of people walk right out the door with everything left on the table when the staff is really being slammed and cannot pull away to clean up the table."}
{"text":"I was slightly disappointed on my first visit to this cafe.  Although I appreciate a variety of breakfast options, neither item we ordered stood out.  With a variety of breakfast hotspots around Madison, I would only suggest this cafe if you happen to already be in the neighborhood.  An additional charge for \"real\" maple syrup on an average waffle was a bit disappointing.  The actual space was quiet and somewhat clean.  Signs on every table instructing you to \"buss your own table\" were rather uninviting.  Overall, a bit pricy for the experience provided... very average."}
{"text":"I went to Yola's Cafe with a friend for lunch. I found the menu to be pricey and the food was not that good. I ordered a chicken wrap. Significantly more lettuce than chicken in it. The chips were awful! You have to pay for coffee refills. Not a good experience. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years!!! Their waffles never disappoint. We had the nutty banana, country breakfast and my favorite pecan!!  Love their coffee as well. Haven't been so much of a fan of their baked goods though. Must visit if u are a waffle fan."}
{"text":"The cafe itself is really nice and would be a great place to grab a coffee and relax. The reason I'm giving 3 stars is the 'loaded breakfast burrito' is mediocre and had almost no bacon. Recommend the cafe but not the breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"I work nearby and have always wondered how this place was. The price was good and the food was average. I had a chocolate chip scone and a belgian waffle. The scone was tasty but the waffle was nothing special. The atmosphere was pleasant but I don't think it was enough for me to return any time soon."}
{"text":"Food is hit & miss but the coffee is always delicious and the gluten free brownies are to die for. Andy & I have been here quite a few times and he loves their egg dishes but I got the tomato basil frittata this past time and was not impressed. It was very bland, had a strange texture, and there was hardly any basil or tomato. Luckily I ordered a brownie to go but ended up eating that for lunch instead. It was so rich and chocolatey  I've had their gluten free waffles before and those are good too."}
{"text":"The waffle w chocolate was amazing. The sandwich is pretty good too. I really like the atmosphere. I love to support local !!!"}
{"text":"My family took a little lunch outing to Yola's last weekend.  I don't feel like I'm entirely qualified to write a full review, as all I had was a breakfast sandwich.  But, it was a very tasty breakfast sandwich with fresh ingredients, which is good in my book.  Everyone else in my party enjoyed their meals, as well.  I like the outside seating area - it's perfect for people with kids who like to run around and act unruly despite their mother's best attempts to keep them still! and respectable!  The woman working behind the register was also the woman who brought us our food. She was incredibly friendly and understanding. I will definitely be back to try more off of their menu."}
{"text":"The waffles here are amazing! I have had the strawberry and the blueberry on separate occasions, and neither time was I disappointed. I only wish they stayed open longer... I am fond of eating breakfast for dinner."}
{"text":"This is a cute local coffee shop that has very friendly staff and comfortable seating. The food and coffee are just ok for me though."}
{"text":"This cafe is quaint and has a lot of locally sourced and organic food. Paying extra for items like peanut butter doesn't wow me since it is not local nor organic, but prices are fair and the atmosphere is relaxing for a slow morning."}
{"text":"IDK, not that great but to be fair got sandwiches. The waffles probably look/are better. The coffee was good. Prices are a bit meh. We ordered something sans bacon and realized we paid $2 more than we needed if we used the \"build your own breakfast sandwich\" option. Kinda disappointed, as new customers, we weren't at least alerted to a better option, price-wise. A bit busy for seating so make sure  you get a nice spot. Outdoor seating looked good for a warm day. The \"home made\" salsa that came with it and chips was very meh to me. It tasted like jarred ortega or something and the chips were like those bite-size tostitos."}
{"text":"Tried Yola's for the first time in the morning on my birthday with family. Nice little small place, has good coffee shop atmosphere. Small area with some indoor seating and a little patio outside as well. Play area for kids and lots of art on the walls.   The counter where you order was small and pretty cluttered. This didn't bother me but my family didn't care for it. We each ordered coffee and food. The coffee was good - but I got a mocha and it was pretty small. I also got the Patriot waffle. Again really good, but small. A bit too small on each for the price.   My wife got the Baked Oatmeal and we all shared a Scone. The Oatmeal was a pretty solid mass, almost like a piece of oatmeal coffee cake or something. I thought it looked good, but my wife didn't care for it. The scone was a bit dry too.    Overall, I think I wanted to like the place more than we did. It was ok, and the service nice, but seemed overwhelmed when a few more people came in. They have a loyalty app that you can download on your phone - I did that for the waffles and found out later I could have gotten credit for the coffees too. Not sure why they didn't tell me that. I'll try it again for lunch someday. Ok place to check out."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Quaint in every detail and a very nice selection of coffee, tea, snacks and smoothies.  I love the cozy interior and the gorgeous patio in summer."}
{"text":"Yola's is the best place for coffee and breakfast on the west side of Madison. I love their handcrafted coffees and treats - and the fact that they have plenty of gluten free goodies!"}
{"text":"Amazing gluten free waffles. Hard to believe they are gluten free. Great place but always busy..... Have had some bad experiences though. Received the wrong waffles and didn't get our coffee until after we were done eating. Full of kids. Hard to find a table.  Really depends on when you go here."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit to Yola's today.   Highlights: Patriot waffle - a nifty combo of a Belgian waffle with strawberry, blueberries and whipped cream (red, white and blue, eh!?!). It was very tasty, and not to pricey at $6.49. On the other hand, I'm pretty sure it was \"strawberry\" and not \"strawberries\" since there was not a huge amount of fruit on the waffle. I gave it a little dash or syrup and all was well, though.   I liked the Yelp check-in offer of a free 16-oz hot coffee with purchase, which went perfect with the waffle. Service was nice, and the waffle was up before I even got my laptop fired up. I'm pretty sure the owners were working behind the counter, which is always a good sign. About the only downside I could find was the contemporary Christian music on the house sound system.  I've nothing against that type of music, but its just a bit overt for me. To each his own, I guess.  All things considered, a nice coffee shop with a good vibe, and I see they have a kids play area, which is a nice touch for a neighborhood gathering place. Much success to you, Yola's Cafe!"}
{"text":"Yola's is great for both an awesome tea (sport tea) and for meetings. I always find the staff friendly and it helps with the overall vibe. I find that Lance and Lisa make the business great and have been fun to train also in my fitness business. Hard workers and great people."}
{"text":"Yola's has been on my list to visit whenever I travel up to Madison but it's taken me a while to get around to it: I regret the wait!   It's a smaller indoor space but with ample outdoor seating. You pay for the quality of the food - you certainly can get cheaper waffles from a different joint, but you won't find offerings like Yola's menu. The lavender and lemon scone was a revelation. The waffles were spectacular.   If you're looking for an interesting, thoughtful take on breakfast food, Yola's is well worth the trip. If you're more of an equal opportunity, lowest-price-point-possible breakfast food, it might be a pass for you. I, however, have every intention of returning."}
{"text":"I was on my way to work and didn't have much time to grab a quick coffee and I knew how crowded \"you-know-where\" can be this time of day.  I also remembered having some tasty coffee  and scones at an event catered by Yola's so I decided to stop in.  One of my friends in college would bring me scones made by her English grandmother and the scones at Yola's are just as good (dare I say better?) than grandma's!   I was relieved to find not a single person in line at 8:15.  I grabbed my coffee and a scone and was out the door in no time! I think this might be my new Friday treat to myself :)"}
{"text":"Yola's is a really nice quiet place to grab a cup of coffee and a quick breakfast in the morning. Their banana chocolate chip bread is one of the best morning breads I have had at a coffee shop. I almost feel guilty eating it, it is so good. Their breakfast sandwiches are also great. I often get their BLT with avocado as a light tasty lunch when I am in the area. I love that they have Door County flavored coffee, as it is one of my favorite types of flavored coffee and reminds me of the feel and tastes of the peninsula every time!  I come in to work at Yola's for a whole morning once every few weeks and the staff are very kind and personable.  One of my favorite coffee places on the west side, and really echos the experience of the coffee shops you see on State St."}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of this place and was excited to bring my visiting family there because of their gluten free options. When we walked in there were only 4 tables being occupied. I had my 9 month old daughter with so we needed to find a table large enough for the 6 of us and a high chair. Our only option were two tables in the back that we had to push together. I had no problem doing so, but my issue with both tables was how dirty they were and clearly had not been wiped. When I went and found the high chair..shocker again disgusting.  Now it came to order. My father n I made our way to the counter where a friendly young woman took our order. We ordered two Greek wraps (awesome!) and a California turkey wrap (again..awesome!). I still never understand why your drinks are in a cooler hidden around the corner which to this day NO ONE EVER tells you about. After waiting 30 minutes one of the Greek wraps made it to the table(which was dropped by a very awkward young man who was aimlessly walking around with different orders before ours) and didn't have the chicken that was requested. 15 minutes later the 2nd Greek wrap has arrived..no chicken. Then after 10 minutes both wraps come back made with chicken. THEN ANOTHER 15 minutes later my California wrap arrives...All with fruit cups. Now in the menu they specify you get tortilla chips and homemade salsa and if you would like fruit it's a $1 upcharge. Again..no biggie we like our fruit..but you didn't even mention the fact \"Hey sorry folks we seem to have ran out of chips..is fruit ok?\"  Lastly..I really feel you should have someone checking the appearance of your restrooms. Both were in poor form and needed some attention.   This was not how I felt when you first arrived on commerce drive. It was actually a go to spot that I often bragged about to fellow friends and family. However after today's experience (especially now that I have a young child) I do not have the patience for Yolas Cafe. Maybe if I find myself bored with a lot of time on my hands I will stop by to wait for a 20 minute latte."}
{"text":"My visit was on a Saturday afternoon. When I came in the place was very busy, but shortly after the lunch hour it quieted down. I had the Chipotle Chicken wrap with the homemade potato chips. It tasted really fresh and had a good mix of flavors and the chipotle mayo had just the right amount of heat. My strawberry smoothie was good as well. I will probably forego the whipped cream next time because it made the drink a little too sweet for me. Overall, I had a good visit and it seems like a popular local spot."}
{"text":"Had the signature breakfast sandwich. It was phenomenal. Herb cream cheese, fried egg, greens, bacon. Yum! Frappe was okay. Tastes nothing like coffee..."}
{"text":"The west side definitely needs more coffee shops, and Yola's has some great potential to fit the bill. It has great atmosphere and varied seating, including various cafe tables, a few outdoor patio tables, and more comfortable spots near the fire. There is also a corner where kids can play, which isn't something I need but which would definitely be nice for those who do.   The person we ordered from seemed somewhat new and unsure of herself, but she was very friendly and was able to get our order correctly and delivered in a timely manner.   We sampled a Belgian waffle with chocolate chips (which was tasty) and a chocolate frappe and hot chocolate (both of which were nothing special). I'd have to try more food items to get a more solid feel for the food and drinks.   My biggest concerns about Yola's have to do with the hours. I spend most of my time at coffee shops on Sundays in preparation for Monday due-dates, so the fact that it isn't open at all on Sunday is a big loss. Similarly, it would be a great venue for Friday or Saturday-night music or other acts, but the hours are pretty limited. Additionally, even though it is not evident in the decor or other areas, Yola's plays very obvious Christian music, which isn't my \"cup of tea,\" as they say."}
{"text":"Cute, nice staff, ok food (I had a wrap and a coffee), maybe a tad expensive for what you get, yes they have WiFi, overall this place is just ok. If I lived nearby I'd be in there frequently. But I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there if you're not close by. Also, I was turned off by the Christian music playing. I don't know if that's normal but it's a bit much for me."}
{"text":"I'm at Yola's at least once a week, sometimes more. I'm one of the moms with kid(s) (well, just one infant, to be precise). I LOVE it here, it's my go-to. The barristas (especially one and I have to learn her name) know my order every time and I rarely have to actually say it. It's nice to have somewhere to unwind and just \"be\" for a time. They have a variety of seating - comfy chairs, solitary tables, group tables, tables near the play area. They also have a great fireplace feature in the center as well as an overall \"homey\" feeling. It's my (calm) home away from my (hectic) home.  Their food is delicious - the waffles are amazing and the California sandwich is my lunch staple when I've lingered a little too long for good conversation and end up with two meals there.  There is typically a very diverse crowd - businesspeople, college students, moms and tots, and the lone wolf. All seem content and right at home."}
{"text":"I love the leather chairs to relax, eat and drink your beverage. This place has it. A nice quiet area to chill. I also enjoyed reading the WSJ and a few other items. The owner was in the shop to make sure things are run well. The location is tucked behind a little row of shops. Once you find it, your golden. It was Good to return and get the high touch service again."}
{"text":"Cute little spot to grab a breakfast sandwich on the West side! Good customer service (but it can take a while at times.) The signature breakfast sandwich is large and delicious. It has herbed cream cheese, fried egg, greens, and bacon. I was excited to see that the fruit cup was very fresh and had raspberries and strawberries (which is much better from my perspective than pineapple and melon.)  The location is a little hidden- you wouldn't really expect a cafe to be near all of the other shopping. The coffee is very delicious as well, strong but still drinkable. They have a large variety of different types of breakfast food as well (if you are feeling waffles or baked goods you should be good to go.)  Wifi, comfy seating, and a play area for children make this a good breakfast spot on the West side."}
{"text":"Compared to other areas, here I get exactly what I ask for and exactly the way I want it to taste. They have a friendly and fast paced staff, and a warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"The loaded breakfast burrito had sort of a weird taste to it.  Would not order it again!"}
{"text":"This cafe is quaint and in a unique part of town.  I was disappointed with the size of the cafe but was impressed with the options."}
{"text":"This cafe is truly great.  The coffee and food are delicious and there is a nice community as well.  In the a.m. the baked oatmeal and Belgian waffles are a must.  For lunch or a late afternoon snack the Greek Chicken wrap is my favorite and of course there are many other options.  Daily they feature a different flavored coffee which is a nice surprise treat.  As for community they frequently have Friday open Mic nights and other learning events throughout a month.  Check it out for yourself!!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax and have a cup of coffee on comfy chairs in front of a toasty fireplace. Tasty/affordable menu! My fav is the Greek Wrap with Chicken."}
{"text":"Great coffee/breakfast stop on the west side of Madison. Yola's is close to my house, and a locally owned cafe I've visited regularly over the past 3 years. We like to pop in for a bite to eat in the summer before heading up to the cabin. Seating inside is limited, but there is additional patio seating during warmer weather months. The decor is not my style, but the food is pretty tasty. I'm partial to the breakfast sandwich, but the waffles, granola, and baked oatmeal are high on my list as well--YUM!! They have the typical coffee/latte selection, and some baked goods including scones. There is a limited selection of lunch items too.   Yola's is closed on Sunday's and open until just 3:30pm the rest of the week, so pop in early! There is plenty of free parking and the staff has always been extremely friendly. A worthwhile stop if your on the far west side!"}
{"text":"Nice place to go with kids,  they have a little area for the kids to play in. The food was alright.  I had there tomato soup and it was good. The kids menu was nice, but the main course had much to be desired.  It was nice to catch up with my playgroup gals for lunch."}
{"text":"Nice little coffee place with comfy seating and friendly staff..Had their coffee and strawberry waffles."}
{"text":"Yolas is an example of why we moved from Chicago to Madison! The owners are behind the counter, friendly.   The Waffles are their specialty, get them a la mode! We bring our 2 year old to \"Waffles with Santa\" their annual community Christmas event. Having \"Liked\" their facebook page, I can see they do a number of events like this.   Free Wifi is handy, but they also have a computer I can use if I forget my laptop. The kid's play area is always clean which is huge for us. The roast beef sandwich has a horseradish mayo and caramelized onions, my fave. We have a small business and have had them do some catering which was a pretty inexpensive way to go and Lance was able to customize it to our needs. He has an old fashion cappuccino machine to bring to fancier events.  Pretty happy to have found \"our\" community cafe/coffee house."}
{"text":"I live close to Yola's and love walking here on warm days to see what their monthly waffle is and grab some coffee. Their food is delicious!! I love getting their signature waffles - sometimes the monthly ones are so good I wish they were always around (bring back the Fat Elvis!)   They have free WiFi and a color printer that you can use (for a small per page fee). Their patio is great to sit on in the warm weather and you can take your food to-go. They also have a corner with some toys and books for kids!  My only issues with this place is the limited seating and that they're not open on Sunday! If you're going during a busy time of day (weekend brunch, for example) don't expect to find a place to sit. This is not a good place for groups larger than 4 (and even that can be a stretch)."}
{"text":"Wonderful, LOCALLY-OWNED, coffee shop!  Perfect for parents with children because they have a little play area!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend it! Great place to do work! Unlike Panera, there are plenty of outlets. The coffee is very high quality, and the food is delicious! Perfect for meetings or just relaxing."}
{"text":"I was saddened to see a few negative reviews here as I have had nothing but positive experiences at Yola's. Owners Lance and Lisa Ratze really understand hospitality and it shows. Ample WiFi and lots of comfy seating make this a great place to get some work done and fill your belly at the same time."}
{"text":"I have a difficult time with Yola. I really, REALLY want to like them.   THEY OFFER GLUTEN-FREE BELGIAN WAFFLES! They used to be SO GOOD!  But the last four times I've been in there, my waffles have been raw in the middle, or I've gotten very sick right after eating them (I don't know if they use the same waffle maker for their non-GF waffles, or what, but it's not acceptable either way.)  Their staff is always *very* friendly (though generally either over-staffed or under-staffed,) and they were one of the first places in Madison to offer almond milk in their beverages, which was great for someone like me, who is both lactose and soy-intolerant.  But like someone else said, the other issues they face are like death by a thousand papercuts. And after getting sick, I just haven't gone back.  It makes me sad, because that part of the west side really needs a solid coffee shop. I wish Yola's still fit the bill."}
{"text":"I visited Yola's Café for the first time and experienced the equivalent of death by a thousand paper cuts.  While I liked Yola's family-friendly coffeehouse concept, a series of service missteps and lackluster execution of the food order made for a less than stellar experience.  While waiting for my wife to arrive, my daughter and I hungrily spied the butterscotch and chocolate chip scone in the display case on the front counter.  We recently basked in the glory that is the oatmeal butterscotch cookie from Batch Bakehouse and hoped Yola's would provide us with a west-side fix for our new butterscotch addiction.  Alas, it was not to be.  The scone was overly dry and lacked the richness of the scones from the aforementioned Batch.    When my wife arrived, there were a steady stream of customers pouring into the café.  After a short wait, a rather stoic gentleman took our order.  He did not greet us, hardly smiled and did not offer any recommendations as we made our picks from the menu.  Frankly, it was a little awkward.  I did score the free 16 oz. coffee offered with a Yelp check-in (thank you, Yelp!).  When we finished ordering, my wife and daughter each asked for a cup of water, which also drew a blank expression from our stoic friend.  We took our number and trudged off to a table, which the party at the neighboring table was using to discard their dirty dishes.  All the unoccupied tables had dirty dishes and were in desperate need of a good wipe down.  After a short wait, stoic dude arrived with my daughter's fruit cup.  At the counter, stoic dude told us the fruit cup contained strawberries, blueberries and pineapple.  What we received was a cup full of cantaloupe and honeydew (which my daughter is not a fan of).  To their credit, when I pointed this out, stoic dude took it back and we later received a large cup brimming with ripe strawberries, pineapple and grapes.  After another short wait, my wife and I received our sandwiches.  However, my daughter and I did not receive our drinks and nor did we receive our water.  So I trudged back to the counter, only to see a long line of customers waiting to order.  While waiting in line, I noticed a water cooler that stoic dude failed to mention when we ordered our food.  So I filled a couple of cups with water and trudged back to the table.  Still no beverage order.  So I trudge back to the counter to check on the status of the drinks.  Still a long line, so I wait...and wait...and wait.  Finally, I get to the front of the line.  I ask stoic dude about my coffee.  He instructs me to grab a coffee cup from behind the coffee carafes.  C'mon stoic dude, you could have mentioned that when we ordered.  So I grab a cup with high hopes that my beverage odyssey was about to end.   Curses, foiled again, the carafe is empty.  After a short wait, the owner finally indicates they are brewing more coffee.  So I trudge back to the table and take a bite of my now cool egg sandwich.  Then the owner indicates the carafe has been filled.  So you guessed it, I trudge up to the counter and fill my mug.  I inquire about my daughter's beverage.  The owner indicates he is working on it.  A minute later, stoic dude delivers the caramel apple drink.  It is lukewarm and tasted like Juicy Juice apple juice with a faint hint of caramel.  For what it's worth, the robust Yola's dark roast is one fine cup of coffee.  I finally start eating the rest of my now cold egg sandwich.  While I like the concept of serving the sandwich on a ciabatta roll, the crust was too soft and did not offer much flavor.  The sandwich was small, slightly larger than an English muffin.  The smoked bacon was paper-thin and did not provide much flavor or texture.  The egg was under-seasoned and by the time I finally ate my sandwich, the greens were warm and mushy.  In retrospect, I should have asked to have the sandwich replaced after my long beverage ordeal.  Other observations: * The wi-fi signal at Yola's is excellent. * The tables are densely packed, making the constant journeys to the front counter an inconvenience for you and your neighbors.  * On the table, there was a list of interesting beverage specials, including a salted caramel chai (yum).  The problem: I didn't see the list until after I made my order.  They really need to post this list by the front counter in a more conspicuous manner.  So, would I go back - maybe, but definitely not at peak service hours.  I do love a good malted waffle, the signature dish of Yola's.  However, if I see stoic dude behind the counter, I am making a beeline for the exit."}
{"text":"The waffles are where it's at! But a cool summer treat they're calling fruit whips are a close second.  Imagine a frozen banana pureed and spoonable, with decadent toppings or plain if you'd rather keep it simple. It's this season's perfect cold treat, dairy free and all natural!"}
{"text":"Once you meet the owners, you know why this place is so popular.   The staff is great, the food and drinks are great for a coffeehouse. Their Wifi is better most coffee houses in Madison. If you are in social networking, this is a great place to network.  Prices are matched to other places. Their front patio allows you to sit outside and enjoy a mid-morning cup.   Lance and Lisa are great hosts and work hard for your business."}
{"text":"The decor is nice. The salad was beautifully described as mixed organic field greens with feta and toasted almonds etc. I would have  laughed at how far below the description the salad fell had it not been so pricey. Should have chosen a scone. Oh and I could do without the Christian tunes piping through the entire cafe."}
{"text":"Visitng family in Madison for the holidays.   Found Yolas on Yelp.  Love to try local places when I travel.  This is my second visit to Yolas in three days.  Its great!  Had the banana waffle, raspberry filled scone, and baked oatmeal.  All very good.  Will definitely come back when I visit Madison."}
{"text":"Decor is cute but it doesn't go together at all and although i'm sure they are doing that on purpose and going for a charming/quaint look it really isn't working.   I had a black coffee and plain waffle. Waffle was amazing (of course:)) and delivered very promptly. Coffee wasn't freshly brewed and the canister of the medium roast was out (and i didn't want to wait for them to fill it) so i just got the dark roast. It was decent but not great coffee.  There was an assorted group of people at 10am on a weekday--moms with their kids, businessmen having a meeting, a guy meeting his contractor, and the hippy college kid. It was a fun crowd.  If im in the area and really needing caffeine i might be back but no special trips out here."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time, but no longer.  Last time I went I told the people working there that I was in a rush, but they still forgot to make my sandwich, and after waiting for 30 minutes and confronting  them about it, they gave no explanation of how they had just forgotten to give me food I paid for.  They didn't reimburse me. I left."}
{"text":"We also really want to like Yola's since we live so close. Cute place. I ordered the waffle wo whipped cream. It came w it anyway. I ordered a side if bacon. It is totally fast food style bacon that should be hidden on a sandwich. The 4 slices didn't add up to one normal piece.   The staff were distracted and not helpful. Not worth the price. Total bummer!"}
{"text":"My more recent visits have been more enjoyable.  I was impressed with ownership/management taking the time to respond to my critique."}
{"text":"Yola's is a sweet little gem.   Everything is fresh, don't expect odd combinations or super progressive food but expect comfort and good quality and consistency!    Personally I enjoy the breakfast sandwich, the cream cheese spread is a little different touch; it creates a creamy tangy blend with the egg and bacon!   Coffee is good too, I am super high maintenance about my coffee, so I would normally only rate their coffee a 4/5.    Environment is warm and inviting as are staff!"}
{"text":"Who could say no to a freshly made Belgian waffle, made from a family restaurant with a secret ingredient, all topped up with strawberries and whipped cream? Not many. This is the featured item on Yola's breakfast menu, along with a few egg dishes, oatmeal, yogurt and bakery.  The lunch menu offers a pretty standard selection of soups and salads, and the drink menu is cafe-standard as well. On my last visit I ordered a smoothie, which was ok but topped with completely deflated whipped cream. :(  The atmosphere is comfortable and seems to attract a varied crowd. There is free wireless and plenty of outlets, also some great patio seating. I must say I particularly enjoyed the cafe's selection of music. Yola's is relatively new (it replaced the west end location of Crema Cafe a few months ago) and still putting itself together, so for now I'll say this place is only A-OK, but offers a lot of potential to become something much more than that. Only time and waffle cravings will tell..."}
{"text":"Total crap food I came with my wife for a long time awaited breakfast date.. This place served miserable food, poor taste in coffee. . Cold coffee s made from hot with ice added to it.. waffle was soggy with out and syrup. . wasted time and pretty expensive. Poor quantity.. old breads for sandwich. . Came out hungry. . Would have rather stayed home for breakfast!!"}
