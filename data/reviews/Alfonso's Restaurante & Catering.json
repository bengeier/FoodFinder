{"text":"Do not go here unless you like being treated rudely. I was there last Thursday, I was \"greeted\" by the front counter knucklehead, who told me I had parked in the wrong spot. The restaurant was empty; the parking lot was empty. I was not in a handicapped spot. Apparently, there was a \"carryout only\" sign in front of my parking space. Unfortunately, a four-foot high snowdrift had covered the sign. ISorrry!  But you can't find a way to tell me in a more courteous way?  Of course, I moved my car -- to a different restaurant. If they are that rude and inconsiderate at the front of the house, what the heck is going on in the kitchen??"}
{"text":"This place has gone completely downhill and fast. Last weeks visit resulted in dirty silverware, a majority of items on menu not available, wine served in a water glass and chicken marsala that looked like pea soup!  Our bill for the chicken, a salad, pizza and a few drinks was $100. Not acceptable to raise your prices and then serve less than acceptable food. Run away!"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Worse service. Horrendous restaurant. Don't waste your time and money. Oh yea, took 2 hours to get a chicken wrap"}
{"text":"My parents were raving about this place so when they asked us to go with them we gladly did.  The first experience was decent, however lacked certain things like prompt refills.  I was a server myself, so I judge more harshly on service. I let this slide due to the fact they were a little busy. The food was amazing especially for a $5.99 all you can eat special!  A couple weeks go by and my parents want to go back again. ... we say of course!  We entered the restaurant around 7:30 pm on a Tuesday,  there were 4 current tables and a bunch of dirty ones. ... must have just missed the rush!  Still standing at the door for 5 minutes, we're finally greeted and seated. Sat for another 5-7 minutes and the server finally comes over. We order drinks and place our orders.  Fifteen minutes later another table was seated near us. We still have not received any food. .. not even plates for our bread that we had asked for. .. where are our salads! ? Same server grabs that table. ... she takes their order and they immediately get bread and salads!  She then comes to our table and asks what we ordered again,  meaning she hadn't even put out order in and we had been there for 45 minutes!  The food is good but the service is terrible!  We got up and left!  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero if I could. We booked the private room for a rehearsal dinner for a wedding and when we arrived they had given our room to a bigger party that had called that afternoon. There was no phone call or ANY contact from the restaurant to let us know we would be placed in the dining room. We chose that place for the fact we would have privacy and to the fact that no one informed us of any changes was unpfrofessional. When we tried to figure out the situation the \"chef\" who looked like he hadn't bathed in a week came out and was completely rude. I was the bride and he had me in tears with using the term \"sweetheart\" sarcasticly and being totally rude for a mistake they made. Nothing was done to fix the situation and I will NEVER go back and will continue to let people know how unprofessional they were. Thank god for Stancato's who had amazing staff and food and was able to make the night awesome. Alfonoso's should really reconsider how they treat there customers and run their buisness."}
{"text":"Alfonso's catered my wedding on July 3, and everything went great! The food tasted great and the team was experienced and professional. They dressed the tables, oredered the silverware, and cleaned up afterwards.  My guests favorite dish was the stuffed shells. We also had plated salads, London broil, and chicken fontini. The crew was flexible and cut and plated our wedding cake on the fly."}
{"text":"I never thought that I would do a one star review. Sadly this place didn't deserve more. I was in tonight for my cousin's wedding rehearsal dinner. It took 45 minutes JUST to get BREAD on the table.  Our salads were sitting, IN VIEW, and uncovered, that whole time - gross.  It took another 30 min for the rest of the foods to arrive, luke warm, and during that time not a single waiter/tress came back to refill water. My BROTHER finally took it upon himself to pour water for 30 people.  When he went to complain to the manager he was treated very rudely. Finally, after the meager dessert plates were put out the manager came in to give coffee to three out of the four tables. The fourth table NEVER got coffee.  Friends, I don't know how this place is still in business. Don't waste your time, money, and taste buds on this place."}
{"text":"I took my wife out for a Birthday dinner with my daughter on 12-16-14  at Alfonsos.  I heard the food was good and it was and my waitress ( Dawn ) was also good ( even with it being very busy ). The problem I have is some of the waitress staff are rude. I had a gift card/ certificate to pay for dinner. After a few minutes, a big blond waitress came over and said  ( in a loud and rude tone ) I couldn't use it cause I needed to spend $100.00 in order to get $50.00 off. She then insulted me by saying (so the tables around me could hear ) couldn't I read the fine print telling me of requirements to use gift card. I showed her the certificate and the fine print was not legible She told me, sorry that's not our fault it's yours and she walked away. I am having second thoughts about going back to use gift card. I may give it away or toss it out."}
{"text":"Waited five minutes at the doorway to be seated. Majority of staff was huddled together and it appeared the only person who could seat us was busy trying to ring a ticket. I was hoping this was not an indication of things to come. Once seated the waitress was pleasant and prompt on things under her control. Placed and order for  for lasagna and had to wait 45 minutes.  While the portion was huge, the service was incredibility slow. During our wait we watched how slow the food orders arrived at the other tables. Slow orders would be understandable if the restaurant was full, but patrons at four tables hardly constitutes a full restaurant. Would I return? Possibly if the service was faster."}
{"text":"Wish I could do no stars.  We bought the Groupon and went tonight, a Saturday night.  Drove 1/2 hour and got there around 8:30.  There was 1 (one, in case you thought you read that wrong) table with people.  We walked in and stood there.  We could see people who worked there.  One waiter guy was texting, the woman walked away.  After a bit, the waiter guy came and was going to seat us but the 3 people behind him said not to.  They had already shut everything down and were closing early to get their hoods clean.  What kind of restaurant can close early on a Saturday for cleaning????  No wonder this place is doing so bad.  Someone needs to call Gordon Ramsey!  Went to dinner elsewhere, came home and cancelled my Groupon.  I'll never go back."}
{"text":"This is my kind of place, no hassle parking, great quality food at a really reasonable price and a nice amount of food for your money. You will leave here with your palette satisfied, your belly full and your wallet in tack. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for quality and affordable Italian food. Love this place and it's food."}
{"text":"Went with  a party of six on a Sat night. Only 2 other tables occupied.  Young male waiter knew nothing. Ordered wine and they had to 1st wash the glassware. Service was very slow and required continually asking for service. Food was very plentiful and was more than ok. Would not recommend based on the service."}
{"text":"Well, I was told this place was good from a friend.  The portions are HUGE. I had Garlic Penne with Chicken and it was okay.  Thats it.  the price was reasonable and the serve reasonable.  A pretty bland experience."}
{"text":"If there was a negative star I would use it. Went to a wedding catered by them. What they shared with the family at the tasting was delicious. What they served was food PURCHASED from GFS. It was awful. The chicken cordon blu was perfect little rectangles obviously processed. Dry bread and a crummy salad to top things off. Their restaurant food is good but when they catered this wedding they turned the tables on all of us. THE DEFINITION OF BAIT AND SWITCH. The owner is less than pleasant to deal with and no apologies offered. TERRIBLE. BUYER BEWARE."}
{"text":"My sister and I came in on a Thursday evening by recommendation of a friend for their 2 for $20 deal. For $20 and the purchase of two beverages we got bread with amazing dipping oil, an appetizer of fried mozzarella, italian wedding soup, salad, eggplant parmasean with grilled veggies, penne with meatballs, and Spumoni! The amount if food we got for the price was amazing, and everything was homemade and delicious! Our server Wendy was very friendly and gave us outstanding service. I can't want to come back and try the other menu items."}
{"text":"The food is actually very good. However, the restaurant could use some updating and maybe some cleaning. The servers try their best, but they just seem understaffed and that leads to slow service. Overall I would recommend this restaurant for an affordable Italian meal."}
{"text":"We went there to try all you can eat pasta for $6.99. It was 90% full and we had to wait 45 minutes to get our food!  What's worse,  they messed up my wife's order... 3 TIMES! When I got my dinner,  I ordered garlic and oil sauce. There was only one problem,  No garlic and all oil.  We just put some cash on the table to cover the bill and walked out.  We'll never go back there again!"}
{"text":"We had a gift certificate that was not honored.  Which is fine, if you give a good reason.  Instead, the \"manager/owner\" would rather say \"maybe they should get there head out of there asses and print the certificate\".  Maybe, you should get YOUR head out of YOUR ass and read the reviews and change a few things! The booth we sat in was held together with duct tape!! Someone please call restaurant impossible for them!!!"}
{"text":"This place is not the same.  Service was horrible and inexcusable.  Brought incorrect dinners to 1/2 of our table 3x.  We kept the incorrect meals after the third try.  The other 1/2 were done with theirs meals at this point.  Furthermore had to keep reminding to bring refills for bread and beverage.  Also found that we were charged for a beverage even though one guest ordered water.  We were told that for the 2 for $20 menu a drink purchase was mandatory.  This policy was not posted anywhere and we should have been informed.  The final blow was that an automatic 20% gratuity was placed on the bill!  I asked the server to get the manager.  She claimed she was.  Christine stated that their register automatically rings up a gratuity for any check over $50!  I have heard of automatic gratuities for parties of 6 or more but never based on the size of the check.  I  was steaming after this experience and will not be back.  Great job, Christine!!  You lost another customer."}
{"text":"Stood in restaurant for 10 minutes and no one was there to seat you or take order. Even called out hello. Sign and posted hours said open. Then, tried to call to make carry out order and the refused restaurant.com certificate. Certificate does not say 'dine in only.' Said it was a typo that they had not yet corrected that the certificate was wrong. Poor way to run a business."}
