{"text":"For a place to name itself after the vinegary, sugared sushi rice, you know they're serious about it.  Housed inside a pretty, wood-printed hexagonal box (it's actually styrofoam), a small box contains about a quarter cup of rice with your choice of neta: choose from tuna, chirashi, and assorted pieces of seafood - although you can't pick the items a la carte.   I found the $17 for my small box of thinly sliced tuna to be a bit pricey - although I know tuna is one of the most expensive picks - while I admit I found it to be of decent quality. I'd also personally prefer my shari to be a bit sweeter, but the vinegar level of the rice did also help to heighten the flavours of the fish, and there was more attention given to the rice here than at many other nearby sushi spots.  If you opt for the large box, it will set you back about $24 and give you the more luxurious chutoro/medium-fatty tuna instead of lean.  Am going to keep my fingers crossed for the appearance of negitoro at some point, but considering the serving sizes, I'd recommend coming here only if you've got a very small appetite."}
{"text":"As their name suggests, come here for the rice, though not necessarily for the fish! Although opened by the same founder as Tachi and Shoushin, it appears that the cheaper cuts of fish make their way here. In fact, the cashier seemed to have difficulty understanding me when I asked if there was chutoro...  I ordered the chirashisushi, which is essentially slabs of sashimi laid on their bed of sweet, seasoned sushi rice. For roughly $25 you can get a generous portion of rice with roughly 9 pieces of sashimi along with two tamago. The rice was well flavoured - perhaps the best I've had thus far. It was just the right amount of sweetness counterbalanced by the vinegar in the rice.   That said, it is quite overpriced. The $25 includes one cooked piece of shrimp, two pieces of lean tuna, two red snapper (or so I believe), one chutoro, two Hokkaido scallops, one tako, two tamago, some salmon roe and sweet shrimp paste. Though I considered getting the tekka don, I opted not to last minute as it contained mostly lean tuna with only two pieces of chutoro. And thank God I chose not to! My pieces of lean tuna were limp and had traces of tendon, making it chewier than expected.  Overall, the quality of the assorted coverings was decent. As aforementioned, the tuna was satisfactory, and the chutoro was a sad excuse.  However, the scallops were amazing! While not as sweet as the other ones I had at Tachi, they were still very juicy, plump, and delicious. The salmon roe was also not too salty, and very fresh (popped in my mouth with each bite!). The tamago was well seasoned, and was a nice light sweet bite - though I do think it could have been fluffier in texture, as you could see that it was overcooked in some areas. My absolute favourite was the sweet shrimp paste. If they served rice with only the shrimp and the scallops, I would definitely buy!  If you're looking to go the extra mile for good quality fish, I would suggest visiting its neighbour Tachi. But if you're satisfied with decent quality fish and are more of a rice purist, come to Shari."}
{"text":"****I FOUND A LIVE PARASITE****  It was found in the chirishi attached to the white fish. It was still moving. I posted a pic and video.  I had to check with a number of restaurants as to how this can happen. I've been eating Japanese for +30 yrs and I have never encountered this. All the sushi chefs I speak to tell me the handling and cleaning process is poor. Chefs often find parasites but they put it through freezing process that would kill all parasites, which can cause sickness.  The restaurant operator refunded my meal and offered me another experience. But honestly, why would I trust it? Poor handling of food doesn't only happen once  Also, tachi uses the same fish as it is a joint restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for the large chirashi. Other reviewers were fairly spot on with the reviews already. The chirashi is pretty good and fresh but could be considered small. I would have preferred more variety, like instead of two pieces of scallops, they could have done one scallop and one uni (which I love) or something. But I'm on the verge of nitpicking.   The shrimp paste was really good, and I don't think I've ever had that before, so it was nice to try something new.  One thing that Japango and Yutaka (both restarants are near Dundas and Elizabeth) do with their chirashi is that they have a regular and a slightly more expensive, premium version, where the premium version would have better fish l(like uni or otoro) and not just simply bigger. I'd love to see Shari do something like that.  In general, pretty good chirashi but could have more variety or be just a tiny bit bigger.  Quality: 8/10. Service: 8/10. Value: 7/10. Overall: 8/10 (not an average)"}
{"text":"Wasn't bad but like JK said the size for a large is quite small. If I haven't had a small meal before   I wouldn't  have been full at all.   I got the one with the chopped sashimi given that it's easier to eat and you get more flavours per bite. The protein to rice ratio was good but again the overall portion was a little chintzy for the price. It was delicious but I was expecting more \"premium cuts\" considering that they're connected to Tachi... no o-toro for me LOL. Overall it was good but not worth it though.   I could've spent the $25 odd so dollars at any generic Japanese restaurant downtown and gotten if not the same better quality+quantity.   3/5 but probably not going to come back."}
{"text":"Very instagrammable chirashi bowls but unfortunately too expensive and too small of a portion size for me to ever go back. The small is $17+tax and came with about 2 pieces of egg, 6-ish pieces of sashimi, and some fish eggs. This would have been an appropriate amount of food if I was a newborn baby. I also asked the cashier if I could see the small and large bowls to compare before ordering (there was no line-up behind me) and she did not oblige; instead she impatiently told me that the large one is \"bigger and wider\". Then when I repeated my request to see each size, she held up the plastic LID of the larger one which was not helpful at all.   As an aside, Assembly Chef's Hall has a lot of different and interesting looking vendors and I would be interested to try other options. There is also a nice patio and abundant indoor seating as well."}
{"text":"As someone who is a big fan of chirashi sushi (essentially sashimi on top of sushi rice), I was excited to see that a shop was opening up solely dedicated to chrashi. I came across a number of great looking pictures of the boxes on Instagram, and they look even better in person. If you can ignore the high price point and the somewhat smaller portion size, it is probably the best chrashi I've had in Toronto.  The shop is located in the General Assembly Food Hall alongside several other food stalls, which is quite convenient if you're grabbing lunch with others as the shop only offers chirashi sushi. They do not offer very many different variations, and my assumption is that substitutions are difficult to accommodate, so if you're very particular about the type of fish you like then it might not be the best choice. As they place a pretty big emphasis on the freshness of their fish, their selection varies depending on the availability of the fish.  It took a bit of time waiting on the food as they seem to make them on the spot rather than setting up preset boxes beforehand. The wait was absolutely well worth it. The fish tasted fresh with none of that odd fishy scent you sometimes get from sashimi. The different pieces of fish also actually tasted cohesive, rather than a random selection of whatever fish they could find which is what I find more typical at a typical sushi joint. Typically with chirashi, I find myself eating the sashimi slices separately from the rice, but this time it actually made sense to blend all the different types of fish together with the rice. Each bite tastes slightly different from one another as the ratio of rice to fish and the type of fish also varies with each bite, so you never get tired of the taste and keep wanting to go back for more to see what you'll get with the next bite.  While there is nothing I can fault about their chirashi, it is fairly expensive for lunch, and the portion size would be too small for dinner even if you were to order the large. I ordered the large box at $25 for lunch and I still felt like I could've had another box. If you're not too hungry and are looking for something on the lighter side, then this will definitely hit the spot. But this place is definitely something I will keep in my back pocket on days when I'm looking to treat myself to a nicer meal. I'll also be keeping an eye on their sushi counterpart Tachi next door if I really want to splurge :)"}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh! Quick, healthy, easy and tasty food. Nothing like it in Toronto! The quality of fish is amazing for a decent price. Definitely recommend to all sushi lovers out there! I visited Shari with my friends for lunch on a week day- the wait was short and all the staff were very friendly. They educated us on sushi rice and the ingredients within the chirashi!"}
{"text":"Great quality vinegar rice (shari) that is flavoured well is a crucial component to a delicious Chirashi bowl (and to sushi as well) - this is definitely the focus at Shari  The rice here is flavoured with their special house blend rice vinegar and mixed meticulously to get rid of clumps and to get the rice to the perfect serving temperature. There are 5 delicious chirashi bowls to choose from, and you can finish off with some fresh and soft mochi from Sasaki Fine Pastry . Absolutely delish   While the bowls here aren't exactly cheap, they will fill you up quite nicely, and the quality is worth paying for."}
{"text":"There is a reason that this food stall inside Assembly Chef's Hall is called Shari.  The shari rice was fluffy with a bite and well seasoned! I personally will be just happy to roll that up in roasted seaweed and eat that as a snack everyday!  Bara Charashi ($19.50) a little small for a large! I would have ate that all by myself and more. Fish though was chopped up but still tasted fresh.  Not recommended if you are really hungry, you would not have enjoyed this."}
{"text":"I've been to Shari a few times, usually opting for the bara chirashi. The bara chirashi consists of various cut-up pieces of sashimi over rice. While the sashimi and the rice are tasty, I found the price to be high for what you get.  I recently ordered the regular chirashi, which consists of larger slices of sashimi over rice. Oh my, it was some of the freshest sashimi I've had in Toronto. The seafood was flavorful, tasty, and just melts in your mouth. I really enjoyed the scallops, which tasted like they just came out of the ocean. The rice is seasoned with the perfect amount of rice vinegar. Although the regular chirashi is quite expensive, it's definitely worth trying."}
