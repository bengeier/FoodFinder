{"text":"One of my favourite burrito places in the TO area.  All of the menu items are delicious, the prices are very fair and the staff is so lovely and pleasant.  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"I was never a fan of Mexican food because I never had any GOOD Mexican food - this all changed when I tried a burrito from Senor Burrito. Every time I come to eat here (which is probably way more often than I should), the food is always fresh and the service is impeccable. They will accommodate you with any requests and are happy to do so. I usually get a chicken burrito and for the price, the size is massive. Their homemade tostitos/nachos are delicious also and instead of salsa, I like to enjoy them with Pico De Gallo. I recommend this place to anyone who wants to give Mexican food a shot - and pretty much guarantee that they'll come back to Senor Burrito soon."}
{"text":"I tried a burrito here last week, and I won't be going anywhere else. Everything was amazingly fresh and the flavours really melted together nicely. The burritos are also really big so if you're hungry, that's a definite plus. It's family owned so the customer service is really friendly and welcoming, and they even put out samples of (homemade!) tostitos chips to try.  If you're in the area, definitely try it. I loved it."}
{"text":"Love it! I give it many stars as you see. Strictly for the service and the food. I don't care about the decor. The food is authentic, delicious and the hostess accommodates everyone's weird requests: I wanted no meat, my friend is allergic to peppers and the guy behind us wanted no tomatoes and with all this the lady kept a smile on and made our food. A genuine smile. I am not making it up. Now imagine Mexican food without peppers or tomatoes or chicken! Weird. But you see me here writing a good review what means I loved it."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a weekday night it's  Cozy Good food Quick service Nothing fancy  Prices are a bit high but worth it"}
{"text":"Horrible service, specifically asked about a wait or list and was told to take next available after sitting for five minutes she came up and said she forgot about a reservation and my friend and I needed to move. I used to go there for lunch because it's close but not anymore."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but lately when I have visited the taste has changed. Not sure but I have thought that the last 3 visits. Sadly this place has disappointed me so I don't think I will be revisiting. Also my girlfriend ordered the nacho chips to go and the portion was ridiculously small which is disappointing considering they give them out as samples I would have least wanted a good sharing portion. The owners seem a bit snappy when I asked them for more sauce. Considering they have seen me there a few times what is the big deal giving me a few more drops. Well ....with all of this combined I won't be visiting any of their locations again!"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect when we pulled into this tiny strip mall and saw a tiny restaurant, I was so wrong. Best authentic Mexican food I've had in a long time! Started with the bean soup which was so good and creamy, then had the enchiladas which had chicken in 2 of them and 1 with cheese. Also had the chilli poblano which was amazing as well. But the star of the whole meal was the side of mole sauce that the kind lady brought out. You can see how authentic and homemade it was, we even told her it tasted better then some we had in Mexico. If you're a fan of mole pls try it, their hot sauce has a nice heat as well. All and all I will definitely be going back quite often."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, appears to be family run which I like to support.    Delicious burritos....they are massive!!  I can never finish it. Authentic, cute ambiance. Hate it when top 40 crap is being blasted in restaurants. Free chips with 3 types of salsa while you're waiting is a nice touch. Recently disappointed with another Mexican place so I'm sticking with the place that puts their customers first!"}
{"text":"From the outside this place looks like just a take out burrito place and there are lots of those around Mississauga BUT this is an eat in place too with cute little booths and great Mexican music playing. I love how casual it is. It's a nice family place to pop in and eat. Now we have been to Mexico many times and love Mexican food we have eaten at all the \"hip and hot\" places including downtown Toronto. I have to say this was really enjoyable and beats out a lot of other comparably priced places. The food is fresh and authentic and flavourful. I had the fish tacos plate and my partner had the chimichanga. Both were well portioned and excellent. I loved the home made beans. Very tasty. They made my two year old a chicken and cheese quesadilla and a juice for 5 dollars. A good deal. The waitress was lovely and accommodating. I hope this place gets discovered and continues to thrive we will be back and recommend it."}
{"text":"Great Burrito, excellent taste, good prices and the place has a very authentic feel overall.  I love Burritos and feel compelled to try them wherever I see a Burrito place pop up.  Walked in, and the place had a very authentic feel. Bit of a hole in the wall, but the lady who made my burrito (owner?) had a Spanish accent (which made me feel like she'd make a great burrito) and made my burrito with what looked like very Fresh ingredients right in front of me.   Took burrito home, and I got to say that it was one of the best burritos I have had in quite a while.  Must try if you love burritos as much as I do."}
{"text":"Muy buena comida, excellent food!!!!! You can try anything, you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Wow, so with limited experience on this menu I can say the chimichanga was the best Mexican dish I've had in Canada. The Burrito was quite good too.  Homemade tortilla chips are thick but light, crunchy and have a sweet corn flavour. Fantastic.  Everything is made from scratch.... Everything. This place is a gem, looking forward to getting through the menu.  Want to get your mexi on? Go, now!"}
{"text":"Horchata, chimichanga, churros - we love our Mexican food.   First, the horchata was great. Who doesn't want to drink sweetened milk with a dash of cinnamon? The portion is large, and the balance between the sweetness and creaminess was perfect. Definitely order this.  Then we had the chimichanga, my husband ordered the chorizo chimichanga while I got the pastor chimichanga. Deep fried burritos are my favourite, but this one disappointed me. It was lukewarm, and lightly filled. there was more tortilla shell than stuffing. Not impressed. After the chimichanga we decided to get dessert because we were both still starving.  For dessert, we had the churros. Those were warm and fresh. Definitely a worthy dessert. Overall, this place was just ok. There's not a lot of decent Mexican sit down places around - most places are take out only."}
{"text":"Really authentic.. Forget burrito boys or chorizos.. If you've ever been to Mexico you'll know what's up.. Been here dozens of times, always great!!"}
{"text":"Fast Fresh Friendly Ordered burrito bowl-presentation was done well .. Tasted even better!!  Crunchy nachos -- home made & not too salty"}
{"text":"Stopped in as I was working around the corner.  Seems to be run by Latin Americans which is much appreciated for the authentic feel and flavour.  I appreciated that they presses the burrito in the grill.  Makes it so much better.  The burrito was perefect all the way through.  A great find and will return  Enjoy this place with friends, family or that ugly guy or girl at the office!"}
{"text":"Originally when we went to this restaurant a couple years ago, I really enjoyed the food and ambiance. We've had the nachos, enchilada's, and stuffed peppers.   The last time we went however, the service was poor as the waitress barely came to our table. On top of that, there were toothpicks in my stuffed peppers that I didn't notice and put into my mouth!   Was not impressed and to be honest, haven't been back since because of this."}
{"text":"Based on flavour of the food and quality of the service that was delivered most of the time 3-4 stars would be more appropriate.   However, the following review is as a result of the following experience: enter the Lakeshore location around 6:30PM on a Saturday night. Order a chicken chimichanga.  Employee: \"Sorry we don't have chimichanga.\"  Me: \"Do you have burritos?\"  Employee: \"Yes.\"  Me: \"Is your deep fryer not on? Chimichangas are basically deep fried burritos.\"  Employee: \"Ummm... I don't think so...\"  Me: \"I can turn it on for you if you like.\" Employee: \"Well, umm, we don't have chimichangas right now.\" Me: \"Did the management not train you to use the deep fryer?\" Employee: \"I haven't had to make one since I started 2 weeks ago\" I check the digital menu to make sure they haven't removed the items... Nope. Me: \"Alright then. Burrito it is.\"  We order a few items, thankfully she had been trained how to make burritos and quesadillas.  Friend: \"Maybe we should get some nachos Me: \"LOL!\" Employee: \"Sorry, we don't have any nachos.\" Friend: \"What about tostadas?\" Me: \"LMFAO\" Employee: \"No, sorry.\" Me: \"You need a deep fryer for those.\" Employee goes over our order. Me: \"We'd also like something from the kids menu.\" Employee: \"We don't have a kids menu.\" Me: \"Your website says you do.\" Employee: \"Umm... I think they're changing the menu.\" Me: \"So you don't have any kids sizes?\" Employee: \" We have quesadilla and burrito. Small or large.\" Me: *facepalm*  On a Saturday night, to have pretty much half of the menu unavailable because the management were too lazy to teach an employee that has been with the company for 2 weeks how to use your deep fryer is unacceptable.   Furthermore I have eaten at this location many times and have always been satisfied with the food, even impressed at times but it seems as though corners are being cut. The flavours are still decent for the most part, but a cheaper - and tougher - cut of shredded beef is definitely being used for the \"steak\" burrito, as opposed to the chunks of tender meat that were offered before.  Finally if the website indicates that you offer a kids meal and the only person operating your restaurant has no idea about it, it is clear that you have no longer any interest in running a consistent and respectable business. And certainly none of this is your staff's fault, it is entirely a series of failures on the management's part."}
{"text":"Good to see that the tacos and burritos keep the same quality and the authentic Mexican flavour. Keep up with the good work!"}
{"text":"Had bookmarked this place and as there was an occasion in the family, the three of us headed out to try this place out.   The interior is quite interestingly done. The benches with tables, the decor on the tables, the salt and pepper shakers, the shades for the lights done with colander were nicely done.   Started with Veggie Nachos - the chips nice and warm tasted fresh, the salsa home made fresh, the black beans and the refried beans, the cheese sauce were absolutely amazing. The quantity not so much. Wish they gave more for the price.   Ordered a Veggie Chimichanga, a wet Veg Burrito and a veggie burrito.   The Chimichanga deep fried was done perfectly, the fillings seasoned done just right. Not greasy at all. The wet Burrito and the Burrito even though on paper were the same tasted different and both were good! One had more rice and the other had more black beans. The fillings of rice, beans and salsa were as fresh as you can get. No doubt all of them made in house and with fresh ingredients. The Wet Burrito had a very small salad on the side and it tasted as good as the best salad we've had.   The server was friendly and the service was one of the best we have had. The owner/chef had come out as well to clarify on a dish that we and the waitress thought was a mixup. But the mixup was not a mixup and by the time the chef came out we had figured it was an error on our part. However the chef, she was so soft spoken and calm.   If you are looking for fresh food and good taste and quality-this is your place for Mexican food. Hope never close. Coming back soon."}
{"text":"Was craving to try out a Chimichanga and this place was down the street from my office  Chimichanga was gigantic and tasty, nothing to compare it to but I liked it a lot and will return a month or two down the road  Also tried the tostada which was pretty filling on its own  Pretty good place and perhaps my favourite Mexican joint aside from Mexican themed Gourmet Gringos"}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 7/10 Drink: 8/10 Service: 9/10 Value: 7/10 Hygiene: 10/10 Aesthetics: 7/10  I have been coming here for quite sometime, and my favourite dish was the Chimichanga. However, my recent visit has caused me to change my mind on the value.   I ordered a Chimichanga (deep fried burrito) and it was not really deep fried. The exterior of the burrito was soft and lacked the crispy exterior it should. The interior was cold and chicken lacked the flavours that they used to use for seasoning.  They renovated the front counter so that you can't specify what to add or not put into the burrito, which I used to really like. Another thing I'm not a fan of is the need to add an additional $1 for guac on the chimichanga when the regular burrito comes with it standard. Considering that I'm paying more for the chimichanga, it should come with it (cause let's face the facts, anyone getting a burrito should always be getting the guac).  The drinks here are good, they have the usual Jarritos selection (including my fave: pineapple), and they have the homemade Rosas de Jamaica and Horchata.  The service here is always good, and they are always polite and prompt.   I would recommend this place as one of the better burrito options in Mississauga."}
{"text":"We have come here twice now, they are definitely the better place to go for burritos in Mississauga, because who wants to go to another typical chain. The burrito has been consistently good here - I got the veggie. The staff is nice and efficient, the prices are average. The first time we went they had their fresh tortilla and salsas out for you to try while waiting. This was great marketing and we ended up purchasing them after, so it was disappointing that they took it away! The need to bring that back. We will come back here, it's a great meal to fuel before a race.  **UPDATE** I am unfortunately on here to lower the rating, I am not sure if they got new owners, or if the renovations have caused the changes but they have changed their ways. Not only do you no longer get nachos and salsa to taste while waiting, they don't let you add anything on your burrito other than what is 'standard'. Basically for my veggie it was rice, beans, friend onions, and sauce. No guac, no fresh veggies, no tomato etc... allowed. That is insane, this is a VEGGIE burrito, I am a vegetarian you cannot fool me into thinking it is expensive to offer some more vegetables on it. Pretty disappointing I really liked this place."}
{"text":"After reading some of the great reviews and just living around the corner I decided to stop by today to grab some tacos. The staff was friendly and polite and efficient  considering I stopped in at lunch and it was very busy.  I ordered the pork and fish tacos with hot salsa they were both very authentic very fresh and just delicious. .I also ordered the lime Mexican pop that was the perfect drink to go with my tacos ...great food highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice place with good food. We went in late afternoon so there were not many customers."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful! The atmosphere was relaxing and we received great service from our waitress. She was friendly and prompt. The food was delicious and well presented. My husband had the fish tacos and I had the chicken chimichanga. They were both very flavorful. I highly recommend coming here!   P.S. I especially loved their deco! The colander lights are super cute!"}
{"text":"Señor Burrito interior is welcoming, from the Spanish music in the background, to the simple, yet appealing, lighting and tables. We started our meal with their outstanding homemade chips and salsa. This is some of the best salsa I've had in a long time. Next, I ordered three different kinds of tacos, and my daughter ordered a burrito bowl, which I got to polish off (it was too good to pass up).     My daughter's chorizo burrito bowl is a perfect blending of complimentary ingredients and flavors, topped with homemade guacamole. ¡Fantastico     My favorite of the night was the barbacoa taco. Hats off to the chef, because this is now the best flavored taco I have ever had, and I almost didn't order it because I'm usually not a fan of beef tacos. The meat is marinated, bursting with flavor, tender, and grilled to perfection. It marries beautifully with the salsa, tomatoes, and onions, with a squeeze of lime juice on top, all neatly placed in a homemade corn tortilla. ¡Excelente     The chorizo taco is also full-flavored deliciousness. It has the same ingredients as the barbacoa taco, and is fantastico. I thought I would like the pastor taco best, but it's at the bottom of the list. It lacked pineapple, and the pork was a little too chewy for me, but this isn't to say it wasn't enjoyable, because it was.     One of two suggestions to Señor Burrito is to double up on corn tortillas for their tacos. They are delicious, but fall apart too easily when not doubled up. I just dived in with a fork, but would have liked eating it the normal way. The next suggestion is just to bring your guests' check to the table, or Yelp then that you have it waiting at the counter. We waited for the waitress to bring ours for quite a while, until we figured she wasn't going to bring it, and went directly to the register to pay.     I definitely recommend Señor Burrito."}
{"text":"This was the most horrific restaursnt I have been too with my family. Went with a family of 7 and my boyfriend had ordered the flataos with a side of mexican rice and beans. Server comes back after 45 mins with plain basmati rice ..after not even telling him that they had no more mexican rice left.....Im sorry?? Does the server not need to demonstrate any courtesy or customer servixe to tell their customer of other options. After sending the food back...the manager walks back with mexican rice acting like nothing has happened. My sister found a piece of hair in her wet burrito and then was claimed that the hair was hers. The manager called us crazy and expected us to pay for that shitty food. Please be advised that this place will forcefully take pictures of you as they think you are some kind of criminals. Not only do they not have good food but no humanitarian respect. Horrible. If i could give no stars, I would. Youre better off with el paso taco homemade kits."}
{"text":"Tried the tacos al pastor last weekend. 4 double shelled corn tortillas with pork, onion, cilantro and grilled pineapple.  Served with guacamole and salsa for $10. The pork could use more flavor in my opinion but overall ok. Will be back"}
{"text":"Got their shrimp naked bowl with tortilla on the side. Great portion size for $15 (after tax). Tons of fillings but the spice level was mild (even though I asked for medium spice!).  The food was freshly prepared and was flavourful! Only thing I did not appreciate was the packing - I got it to go and it was so leaky and wet. Not a good take-out item.. that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Went to this place from an apparent \"paid review\" from Insauga. Since I'm a pretty big Burrito fan I was very excited to here about this place and how it's the 2nd best rated Burrito in Mississauga (first being Burrito Boyz).  Anyways, upon walking in they have no apparent menu posted, but rather two boards which what I assume are their specials. The lady offered me a take-out menu to look through their offerings. Looking through their menu, I was shocked to see some of their outrageous prices, $8 for Chips and Salsa???? For a very similar price I'm eating a Burrito!   Even though I'm complaining about the price, I went ahead and ordered a Burrito with Chips and Salsa, the total came up to $20~ dollars. In my opinion that's insane for this caliber of restaurant and quality.   I ordered my Burrito \"spicy\" and was surprised to find it wasn't spicy at all! Regardless of that the Chicken was the shredded type; you know the type they don't use in Mexico. Not only was it shredded but it was so very dry and lacked a lot of taste. I hate to sound crude but I could probably muster up a better Burrito with an Old Elpaso kit.   The Chips were also had gone stale and obviously didn't taste very fresh. They lacked any sort of seasoning; not even any salt. They really didn't taste like something they made there, but rather purchased from a supplier of some sort. The Salsa was also a little weird, it lacked any of the characteristics of other \"fresh\" Salsas I've had (freshly chopped tomatoes, a little flavour).   I hope once again to not sound crude, but this was probably the worst Burrito I've had to date.   Sadly Insauga had let me down with this one. I guess you live and learn."}
{"text":"I have to reiterate my review. I went back again to try and like it. I had the tacos al pastor again as well as a tostada. It has a good 'homemade' taste to it but I guess I'm just not a fan of real Mexican food."}
{"text":"Totally grossed out by this place. Found a big chunk of plastic in my burrito, thank goodness I don't inhale my food or this could have been bad. Burrito wasn't grilled enough, and not that flavourful. Burrito boyz way better. I will not return."}
{"text":"I like this place a whole lot, but the wait time is pretty bad because of the owners' inability to find capable staff.  They have 2 locations and this is the second of the 2....almost an after thought.  The hours are also a big concern because they were open for lunch and now only open after 4pm.  The food here is delicious and the owner is super nice....and the prices are appropriate for the quality of food.  I hope that this location makes it...would be sad to see it go away."}
{"text":"Happy Cinqo de Mayo!  Yes how predictable - went for Mexican on May 5th.   We have been searching for authentic Mexican food in the west end for quite a while, and based on YELP reviews decided to try this place out.  Food 4/5 for taste, but if you have an MSG intolerance/allergy I would stay away - major reaction that night/next day.  We had a steak chimichanga and a steak burrito. They have chicken, pork and veggie options as well and you get to chose your toppings before they place it on the portable grill.   The portions seemed huge to me (just barely finished the chimi) but my husband was still hungry after his burrito.    We both ordered medium spice and I have to say it was closer to mild. If you like a bit of a kick you probably need to go 'hot\"  They have a coke fridge full of canned pop, water and juice as your drink options.  Ambiance 3/5 Place is small, maybe 12 tables, with kitch-y mexican decor and brightly painted walls.  You order from the cash and wait for your food to be prepared in plastic baskets.  The staff were very friendly and the place overall seemed pretty clean.  Price 4/5: two mains + two pops was just over $20 so decent considering it costs that to go to a McDs these days.    The storefront is right on Erin Mills Parkway but you have to get into the parking lot from the back streets. That was a teeny bit confusing, but all in all. Was a good meal.    This is definitely in the category of fast food.  If I worked in the area I could see it being a regular lunch spot, but for dinner, I will continue to search for a decent sit-down Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd stop on my search of the best mexican in Mississauga. Its more like 3.5.   I ordered 2 tostadas 1 chicken burrito. The tostadas were really tasty they were pretty filling. They were $3.50 each and worth if for an appetizer. The chicken was  well seasoned and the service was fast. It may be become I came at an off time but none the less the food looked fresh and not like it had been sitting there all day.  The burrito was pretty big but it only came in one size and I wish it came in a regular and large size as I normally like to get a large burrito. I always skip on beans since I am not a fan of them but I got the chicken with some extra rice. The rice was tasty as well.   My only complaint would be that most places put extra rice to make up for the fact that I dont put a lot of veggies in my burrito but they didn't but then again the burrito only come in one size so there isn't much that can be done about that.   I've seen better more friendly staff at other mexican joints, the staff just seemed a little annoyed with everything but service alone would not stop me from going to a place.  I'll probably try this place one more time and update the review but so far El Sombrero is still in the lead is Mississauga. I still have a few places to try. So far Señor Burrito is ranking 2nd."}
{"text":"$16 fish chimichangas is the bomb!!! I would give it a five star except the lady forgot to include the guac that we've paid for. Human mistakeee. I would definitely go back and recommend this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"Yummy as usual with great service! We had the quesadillas/veggie.. they were perfect! Service was quick, courteous and always with a smile."}
{"text":"Just okay for me, with not a lot of the favours I am looking for in Mexi-Spot. I have given the burritos two try's over the space of a year or so with the same results."}
{"text":"I just had my first burrito from here, and I have to say it was great! It definitely tasted authentic, and tasty! I like it better than burrito boys 1. Because it isn't a chain restaurant 2. It has real spicy beans instead of refried beans. This makes the burrito a lot less sloppy. They also have great hot sauce. Glad I finally came here! Oh... And the burritos are the weight of a small child. Filling!"}
{"text":"The absolute best pastor tacos I had outside of Mexico. Pozole soup is also a must have! This is a great spot just off the QEW!"}
{"text":"Heard from a good good buddy that this place was a must try. We had guac chips and salsa excellent and I had the pastor tacos also very good. I'd like to come back and try the rest of the menu :)"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at the quality, freshness and flavors! This place is relatively close by and I love Mexican food. So thought to give it a try. Will definitely go back! We did get take out, atmosphere looked inviting. Would like to try to dine in next time. We tried the fish Tacos, and fish burrito."}
{"text":"Authentic and friendly, great service. Burritos are just the right size and good value for the money"}
{"text":"You never find Chimichangas in Canada. This place reminds me of the Mexican spots in La. Fresh ingredients. Huge helpings. YOU gotta eat here ®"}
{"text":"Looks like a hole in the wall, but Senor Burrito is a hidden gem if you're in the area. The nachos are great, Burritos and Chimichangas kill it, makes me want some right now that I'm talking about it. I'd suggest getting the tacos though; come small on a plate of 4. Chill place to go during the day- it's starting to get packed during lunch though. Also a great place to get takeout, love this place and wish them the best."}
{"text":"My husband loves mexican!! I'm not a fan of Mexican food but this place may have changed my mind about it. The food was very fresh. Especially their guacamole! It's a small place but the staff was very nice. The food came in a timely manner and the waiter's recommendations were helpful. The decor was very nicely done and the Spanish music playing was very inviting. The overall ambience was nice. I had the wet burrito. The sauces and filling for the burrito were a great combination. The portions were quite large. I definitely recommend this place and will be going back."}
