{"text":"Very, very yummy fries. I ordered the cobb salad, in an effort to avoid the grease. What a nice surprise; it was fantastic. You know when you see food coming and you really, really hope it's yours...then it is. It was like that. And it tasted as good as it looked:-)"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Clyde's as a bar. More often than not, it's overrun with cegep kids. But as a restaurant, it's still a place I don't mind going. I'm not sure why, though. I think it's because I live close by and they make good fries. Other than that...meh. The service is crap. It takes ages to get your (overpriced) food, and for some reason the waiters seem hell-bent on taking away your plate before you're finished eating. Seriously, if I'm still picking at my fries and my friend isn't even finished her sandwich, don't  try to whisk my plate away! Just ridiculous.  Now that Ye Olde Orchard has opened up down the street, I'll probably be going to Cyde's even less. Granted, the last time I went to Y.O. Orchard it was packed and the service was abysmal, but I blame that on it being new. Right now it still seems like a better bet than Clyde's."}
{"text":"Decent prices, decent selection of beer accompanied with a good decor. The dance floor is a bit cramped up but they made a good use of the space available.  Avoid Fridays at all cost. FILLED to the brim with 18-19 year old obnoxiously loud and clumsy Abbott students.  Avoid one of the bartenders as there are some that are apparently pricks and will treat you like garbage because he disagrees with you on said-and-said subject, like for instance giving a tip only if the service is appropriate. Apparently you must give a fat tip to a server (or in this case a busboy) even if the quality of the service provided was garbage. Don't believe me? Have some proof:  https://i.sli.mg/lPWxtd.png  I will not be going to this pub anymore as this is not the kind of service I desire."}
