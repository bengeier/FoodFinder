{"text":"Hubby and I went on a Wednesday night about 6:30. The place was almost empty but cheerful with nice decor and black chalkboard tabletops that they supply with chalk and old school erasers for your drawing pleasure! Fun!
Big selection of burgers with lots of build your own options as well. Also LOTS of condiment choices including two kinds of onion, two kinds of horseradish, Dijon mustard and chunks of sweet peppers. Hubby had the Onion  Ring Burger (rings, havarti cheese, chipotle mayo and bacon); I had the Clara Burger ( fried egg, hot mayo, bacon and hickory sticks!). YUM! Burgers are cooked how you choose - and the egg, too! Awesome onion rings. Fries are average. Some background music would be nice. Well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Thought id try this place out since its in the neighbourhood.  I was the only customer in there and i know why. My burger was quite small and undercooked and the Caesar salad I ordered was terrible. Also all the tables are chalk boards so they feel awful on your hands and it's just too weird to eat off them. The bill for my small burger and terrible salad, plus a juice was $18!!!! 
The prices are kind of of outrageous since there isn't table service and the food isn't that good... I eat out pretty much every night and on the Bloor strip during the day there aren't alot of good burger options but I'm never going back. 
Duffy's is actually quite a good burger I should have went there;("}
{"text":"First visit was better than the experience I had today. My rating would honestly be lower if not for the undeniably good eats. Walked in around 7pm, and the place was empty, as another reviewer mentions. Dead silence, two emplyees sitting on the couch watching movies on their phones.

 My boyfriend and I approach the counter, and the younger chick at the cash gives us a look like we already know what we want. She glares.. the place is silent, and I politely tell her we need a moment in hopes of diverting the piercing stare. Still, she glares us, and her expression is not pleasant. I feel uncomfortable and pressured into picking something quickly,  so I choose the Avocado Chicken. She glares back at the menu, and looks frustrated, then lets us know we can take a seat. Of course, she has to run out to the store and get an avocado for my burger.

Fast forward to our food being brought out, (and the awkward process of having to come up and dress your burgers), my chicken appears to be plain on its bun. I ask for tomatoes and lettuce.. she tells me (rudely) that it already comes with those. Confused, I then ask for cucumbers (I get two slices of them), and mayo. She recommends the spicy mayo and puts it on before I can respond (no complaints, but still mad awkward).

The best thing about the burger was the meat. Otherwise, pretty boring. There was no lettuce, and the diced tomatoes it came with would not even stay inside the bun, (never mind the avocado). Ive never had such a messy burger with barely anything in it before. Their onion rings are great, though I see this time around they've replaced their ketchup with single ketchup packets?

After serving us, they were right back to their phones. Felt like an inconvenience the whole time.. mediocre food this round. Sadly, I dont think Ill be going back there, purely based on the shit service. Really unfortunate.."}
{"text":"Okay, so it's not like the other reviewers are wrong. It's all true: you walk in, you are the only one here, and the girl stares at you while you try to figure out what you want, and then runs to the store to get the ingredients.

Yes, looks unrehearsed, a little awkward, and quirky. 

So what? It's so refreshing and funny with its own charm that we love in the movies and can't stand in real life.  The food is really fresh and good. The place is very clean, and personally I enjoyed the experience.

I had the sliders and the green salad, it came to $13 all together, which is a good price.  The sliders are fresh and it's fun to try different flavours. In fact, I was full and took the salad to go. The girl warmed up to me at the end.

Also, lots of room and peace and quiet if you'd like to get some work done.

Yes, I would come again and would enjoy the slight awkwardness of it all : )"}
{"text":"So I decided to try this place out since I walk past it so often and I was naturally curious about it. I have no regrets whatsoever. Clara's burgers are absolutely delicious! The meat is fresh and cooked properly (however you like your patty) as well as the toppings. The sauces they have are quite tasty. I was told Clara makes the chipotle mayo herself, and possibly others. Another thing that grabbed my attention were the chalkboard tables; it gives you a chance to get creative! What really makes me come back to this place is the great service. The employees are very kind and seem to enjoy working there which I find to be very important! Happy workers = happy customers. I hope this place stays open for many years to come because these burgers deserve to be devoured."}
{"text":"I've been to Clara's 5 times. If I had written a review after the first time, I would have given them four stars. However, each visit after the first one has gotten progressively worse.

The burgers are getting smaller and smaller. They are often out of many things on the menu, and the service, which was never that great to begin with, has also deteriorated. I might give it one more chance, but honestly, I don't think they really deserve it."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and great staff!! Lots of burger selection as well as condiments. Burgers are always fresh and yummy!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite new place for an affordable meal in the west end.   They have good beers on tap, they have lots of fun and creative burger options (or make your own), the homemade hamburgers and sides are always done perfectly and to order, and the service is always so nice and friendly.   

The prices are super cheap - $8 for a gourmet fancy burger, and even cheaper if you get it as part of a special.  Seriously, last week it was under $10 for a whole combo fancy burger/fries/drink.  

I almost hesitate to review it because I don't want it to get super crowded with hipsters, but I do want it to do well enough to stick around!

This place is a refuge of warm friendly down to earth cheap good food, in a neighborhood that has rapidly filled with overpriced trendy upscale restaurants.  And you can even have conversations over your beer and burgers without needing to yell.  

Additionally, I'm glad that the main space is wheelchair accessible so I can go there with my friends that use chairs, though the bathrooms are downstairs.

So glad this place opened."}
{"text":"Brought some out of town guests in here for lunch after walking along Bloor and did I ever get praised for my choice! :D 

Ordered a bunch of different sandwiches (nacho, bruschetta and the \"Clara\"). Took a little longer than expected but there was only one girl working - should maybe consider one more person for lunch rush (maybe have the owner pop in for an hour or two to help out). 

Also seemed a little disorganized and unsure, not sure if the place is just new and ironing kinks out or what... 

Good otherwise, tables are chalkboard so great fun drawing while we waited."}
{"text":"I give this place six months, which sucks because the burgers are actually really good!

but atmosphere wise...man, they need to change it ASAP. walked in on a Thursday night around 7 and the place was completely empty and there was no music on. It was so quiet it was actually unsettling, and you can hear your burger being made in the back which is just odd. 

I was excited to have a Stiegl on tap and onion rings with my burger....then was told that they were out of onion rings (?????) and out of EVERY SINGLE TAP BEER. (?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!) = poor. very, very poor. 

Anyway, ordered my burger and fries and a bottle of beer. Server brought out the beer. Then when the burgers are ready, they kind of awkwardly have to call you back up to the counter to choose your toppings...my friend and I had to interrupt our conversation and choose toppings (can they not just do this when you order?\" hey what do you want on it?\"). the whole process was weird and annoying.

they should also just have vinegar, ketchup, napkins, salt and pepper ON THE TABLES...after you choose your toppings and get your burger, there is yet another stop at another counter to add these ingredients to your food. it's just confusing and kind of dumb, to be honest. who organized this place?

anyway...once you get past the lack of tap beer, onion rings, extreme stillness, and awkward process, the burgers were really good! Meat was tasty, toppings were fresh and good, I liked the fries.

Clara's needs to fix just about everything about the actual experience so that their delicious burgers can get more of the attention."}
{"text":"The decor was definitely a strong point. Small place run by two girls, overall the portions were a bit small 5oz patty but it does make up for favour

The service was good, pretty empty for middle of the afternoon but I think they recently opened so Cant hold that against them

I had the onion ring burger. Honestly. The onion rings were the highlight of meal but overall favour was sweet, add in crazy decor, great service and we have a winner"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I am usually one for pointing out failures in a place and as an ex MMA fighter I don't give up easily.. but Clara's has always been quality. Service, Food and Decor. Great work, keep it up. Best in Brock Village for a burger."}
{"text":"Well, here goes...


1. The girl at the counter is totally miserable, and clearly doesn't know how to treat a customer. For example, if you don't know what you want to order, she will stand there and stare you down angrily, until you choose. I don't know about anyone else, but it make me super uneasy. Because of this, I have only ever tried 2 things off of their menu. I don't know why this is, but maybe she shouldn't be working in the food service industry if she can't deal with serving customers...
2.The owner as well as the employees are always on their phone/tablet/laptop when you walk in, and always look extremely irritated that someone might want to dine at their establishment. Why are you open if you don't want people coming in? 
3. Almost every time I have come in here, my burger has been raw in the middle, and the egg I order on it is undercooked. The worst part about it, you will get judged for not wanting to eat things that could potentially give you food poisoning! I mean, sorry for liking my food cooked..... 

I could keep going on, but it would be way too long to read....
Maybe this place should just close up and the owner should just continue to cook her burgers for her friends and family, because she clearly doesn't know how to run a good business...

*Note: The only reason I give this place 2 stars is because I like some of the decor."}
{"text":"Had the Clara Burger and have to say its one of the best burgers I've ever had. Onion rings were perfection. Tables are painted in chalk paint to allow you to express your artistic side. Nice selection of beer on tap. In a city crowded with burgers on nearly every menu, Clara's truly stands out. Highly recommend."}
