{"text":"This is a nice cozy little neighbourhood pub.  The suicide wings are some of the best around.  Great, intense heat, but with some really nice flavour and tang.  Not just spicy.  Have also had the fish & chips and the beef stuffed yorkie, both of which were excellent.    Super-friendly staff, too.  Great place to grab a pint and bite.  Happy it's here."}
{"text":"We had a craving for our favorite...the Fish N Chips. But now we have to find another place...this place is gone! Yep...closed. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Omg no .. Cafeteria food at best red wine and water were the best .. Should hhave known 3 people in the whole place"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice.  Tried a third time but they were out or what we went for.  We go specifically for the Chicken Yorkie.  It's amazing!  Service is a little slow despite not too many people in the place but we always go on weeknights so perhaps that's why.  Last night we were told they had run our of chicken wings and cheese curds.  We ordered one of the Chicken Yorkies and an order of bacon & cheddar poutine (which was the special $11 and didn't involve cheese curds).    We split both dishes but were very full so asked if we could take the rest of our poutine home.  We'd only had maybe 10 fries out of it.  We were told NO.  It was for DINE IN ONLY.  Except we HAD dined in and we did PAY $11 for it.  We were told it was HOUSE RULES.  I honestly thought the waitress was joking!  I understand not being able to take home stuff from a buffet, or and \"all you can eat\" meal, but this was ONE order and we paid for it!  What's the difference if it leaves the restaurant in my stomach or in a takeout container???  All they would have done was throw it out....hopefully not recycled it!  We were very ticked and since the service was slow and they rooked us out of our poutine we didn't tip.  The waitress gave us major attitude as we were leaving.  Won't be going back there anytime soon!  Horrible customer service!!"}
