{"text":"Ordered from here several times through UberEats.  Food was average, price was OK.  Will probably order from here again when I'm craving Chinese.  Have yet to try their sushi though!"}
{"text":"Okay first I thought the food would be basic like most take out places however I was extremely surprised.  I ordered the lunch special of the fried rice with mixed vegetable and tofu. It was very good. The fried rice was tasty and the vegetables with tofu was superb. I was very surprised at the quality of the food and the quantity. Good prices for lunch menu and it includes a can of pop.   I will be coming back here again to try other items on their menu.  The only negative remark, I would have is the inattentive female cashier as she was busy eating her food and watching to shows than paying attention to customers. We were waiting for a bit until she noticed us."}
{"text":"I abosolutely love the food at this place. We have been coming here since it opened maybe three or four years ago.  It's one of the very few places that make your food fresh to order, at least most of the time. Be prepared to wait while your food is cooked. However several times in the past six months we have got egg rolls that were cooked and then reheated.  Usually on the weekend.  Maybe different cook?  The very last visit I had the same experience and took one bite of the reheated burnt egg rolls and threw all four of them in the garbage. I wish I could have taken them back and made whoever cooked them eat all of them.  Maybe then he wouldn't do this again. I would love to complain about it but I don't want them to do something nasty to my food the next time I come. I was reading the other reviews and here is something else that's true. They hired a girl at the front that has a permanent grumpy face on every time you go there and she acts as though she is doing you a favor by serving you.  Can be a bit rude. Do yourself a favor check your egg rolls before you leave if doing takeout but enjoy your food from there.  This place has spoiled all the other Chinese places for my family."}
{"text":"Called for delivery on a Friday night. The attendant was pleasant, clear and let me know that the food would take about an hour to an hour and a half to arrive (didn't bother me but something you might want to keep in mind). I ordered the General Tao Chicken, Veggie Fried Rice and Plain Lo Mein (received Veggie Lo Mein instead but again, not bothered). Total was $29 after tax and delivery.  Let me preface by saying I'm not a picky eater and I'm generally easy to please :)  The food looked delicious but that's about it :(   Both the noodles and rice were super greasy and left a film on my tongue - way too much oil. The noodles were also pretty bland - very little flavour, just oil.   The chicken was mostly batter and oddly... crunchy? Once you got over the outer crust, the tiny piece of chicken on the inside was chewy, so much so it got to the point where I stopped trying to break it down with my teeth and just grabbed the remainder out of my mouth and tossed it out. The chicken also had a fishy aftertaste (shared oil perhaps?) After having a small portion, I felt queazy about an hour later. On a positive note, the flavour of the GT sauce was good :)  You'll most likely get better quality Chinese at ANY mall in the city. *shrugs*  1 star for quenching my hunger but if you're looking for something delicious (heck, just decent) I'd order that pizza you were trying to avoid. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I was expecting to walk in for a styrofoam container filled from a hot table.  Nope.  While you order from a menu on the wall, each dish is made to order.  Expect to wait for it to cook.    I went in with a couple of my staff. One ordered Chicken wings, the other ordered Chow Mien.  I decided to test things out--I ordered a bit of sushi.  I know, like the sushi in the plastic containers in the supermarket, I had to see if it was the usual \"day-old\" tasting sushi with crunchy rice.  It was not.  The meals arrived screaming hot.  Fresh out of the wok or fryer.  My sushi rolls were cold--like they are supposed to be.  Panda Chef is on my short list: if I need quick Chinese, and my alternative is the slop in the food court, I'm going here..."}
{"text":"I ordered the combo 2 that had chop suey, general tao chicken, an egg roll and fried rice. Huge portion for $10, it was enough that my wife and I could split it and have left overs. Definitely going back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favourite sushi take out spots! Prices are reasonable and they serve generous portions of quality food. My go to order is the red dragon sushi, salmon lover combo (which you can order half sashimi, half sushi) spicy salmon sushi and honey garlic chicken with rice! Service is usually always quick and easy. My only suggestion is to open up more locations :D"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it's probably one of the better Chinese take out in the area. I have not tried the sushi but I'm working myseld up to it.  Favs - Shanghai noodles, beef and broccoli, chicken chop suey, chicken fried rice  Not so much - sweet and sour pork ribs. Not horrible but personally don't like the taste. Beef and mixed vegetables - too saucy, barely any meat.  I will keep ordering from here until I try all items. But so far so good!"}
{"text":"This is our fave Japanese & Chinese takeout place in the area. Prices are reasonable & food is good quality. If there are just 2 of us the Maki Party Tray A gives us a generous selection of 6 gourmet sushi rolls for $30.99 & we usually supplement that with 2 spring rolls @$1.30 each & a wonton soup for $3.75 & an egg drop & corn soup @$3.25. If we have 3 to 4 people we get Maki Party Tray B which adds 2 special rolls to the 6 choices of gourmet sushi rolls @ $40.99.   If we're in the mood for Chinese food instead, we'll typically order spring rolls, crispy chicken wings, BBQ spare ribs & the steam dumplings & pan fried pork dumplings if we're in the mood for dim sum. My oldest daughter loves crabmeat cheese wontons so that usually winds up somewhere in the order :)  If we don't order any dim sum or sushi, then  we order Black Pepper Steak, my personal favourite Chinese dish and a shrimp dish such as Garlic Shrimp.  There's one peculiarity about ordering from Panda Chef I wish they would change though: the absence of a Tobiko Roll in their list of regular sushi rolls and their refusal to add extra Tobiko to any of the gourmet sushi rolls, even if you pay for it. Admittedly the Tobiko sticks to the transparent top plastic of the tray if you get a circular Maki tray as your takeout but surely they could try to use higher topped takeout packaging to compensate for that problem? I love the salty pop in my mouth of flying fish roe or salmon roe and I like to order two Tobiko sushi rolls to savour as an appetizer for myself, followed by some kind of salmon sushi or sashimi. I like everything else that Panda Chef offers, so it's a shame that they don't want to offer me the Tobiko I crave as a satisfying salty guilty pleasure. I would raise my 4 Star rating to a 5 Star rating if only Panda Chef would add Tobiko Rolls to their regular sushi rolls menu!"}
