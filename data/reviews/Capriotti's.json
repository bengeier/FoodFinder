{"text":"A great sandwich shop with nice, filling sandwiches. Very reasonably priced and friendly staff. Try their custom-sandwiches for a neat treat.  And remember to sign-up for their mail online. There are cool deals in store!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love love LOVE this place. Best sandwiches ever...seriously. Delicious!  The staff is always wonderful and very friendly. They know how to make a good sandwich! if you are visiting Vegas, go eat here!! If you are a local that hasn't eaten here, GO EAT HERE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Sandwiches in America.   Consistently excellent, no matter which store.   I love the Pastrami but my wife insists the Turkey, Cranberry and Stuffing is better.     Of course she's right  \"Yes, Dear\"."}
{"text":"Had to try this place from all the good reviews I've read and it did not disappoint!! Awesome subs what else can I say, your just gonna have to try it and you will see!"}
{"text":"Food came out in a timely manner but there is a small wait (10 min.  max.) during lunch hours. Super delicious and work the small wait"}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's, the Bobbie is AMAZING if i were to rate them in general, i would give them 4.5 stars.  I get cravings for it all the time ..which brings me to explain why i am giving this particular location 1 star. This location, which is a part of a gas station (???) is the closest one to where i currently live and the two times i have gone there with a wild Bobbie craving, at around 7:30 PM, BOTH times, they were \"CLOSED.  Out of bread\"....WTF? what kind of sandwich shop \"runs out of bread\" and then closes at 7:30???   Do they not bake their bread fresh on location? Otherwise, how could they possibly run out?? Not cool."}
{"text":"after my day started at 0 dark thirty, by 12:30 i was faminous, stopped by this place next to the gas station to order a quick lunch.  One absolutely beautiful, kind, ingenue took my order to eat in. i originally wanted their \"bobbie\" altered to include turkey, cran sauce but no stuffing but instead ordered their cheese steak served hot (it's actually cold in vegas today). i ordered a small plus a drink. $9.00 and 10 minutes later, i got a huge sandwich (i could only eat half).  Had to change the order to go becoz of how long it took (waah!) but the bread was really soft, and what was stuffed between it was really fresh meat, grilled onions and american cheese plus veggies ordered at my request. IMHO, a little expensive for a lunch sandwich, but the small is really large for what you get. p.s. on my order chips were extra, and there's no \"name-brand\" kinds, they only order Wise brand chips (the kind out of the vending machine you get at rest-stops along highway routes) LOL"}
{"text":"Not the healthiest choices here. But if you want a full flavor and hefty sandwich capriottis is your best bet. All of the sandwiches I've tried here has been amazing! Still my favorite is the Bobbi"}
{"text":"Best sandwich s  ever! Great location  Awesome staff A must!!! If you  want good food  Go here"}
{"text":"I ordered a large party tray online the day before our party and my husband picked it up right on time and it was perfect! The sandwiches were fresh, packaged nicely and there were large sides of condiments which I loved so everyone could prepare them just the way they wanted. My only mistake was not just getting all bobbies. I even had friends who'd never had capriottis before who are now hooked on the Bobbie. All in all a great idea for our party. Thanks guys for doing such a fabulous job and helping make the day a success!"}
{"text":"Brutal! Raced to get here 5 minutes before closing to a bunch of teenagers closing \"early\" even when the neon open sign is still on AND it was not actually closing time. Good business Caprotti's"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Capriotti's for over 25 years and love this place. However the store on Decatur and Blue Diamond needs help. I was at this store again today 9/12/2017 and I can tell the employees were trying hard to make everyone happy but the restaurant is in serious trouble. Customers asking for refunds leaving upset. I will still eat at Capriotti's but at another store. This one doesn't have a clue what they're doing."}
{"text":"I don't get the rave reviews about their sandwiches. They're just OK and the barbecue chicken salad had too much barbecue sauce. I didn't care for the employees' laid-back attidude playing around with each other (shouting out to each other) by the food prep area because it was slow and using their cell phones. Very unsanitary."}
{"text":"This place is a regular for us from the call centers nearby and they never disappoint. Had my favorite Capastrami for lunch today and it was impeccable. Must try if you've never had! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Best Capriottis location we've been to. We went Sunday around 1pm and the staff was so friendly and filled with positive energy. It was pleasantly surprising to see the staff enjoying what they do while dancing and singing while continuing to work. We've been to Capriottis a million times and this visit was the best ever. The bread was SOO soft, and my Bobbie was filled with stuffing and delicious. My boyfriend agreed and had a Philly, his bread was soft and had a generous amount of steak which doesn't usually happen. This location is rather far from us, but we may just come back for the food quality and customer service."}
{"text":"Travelling to Vegas you always get hit up on places where you should eat!  If you want some good fast food sandwiches for a quick lunch, this is a good spot if you ask me!  Like everyone said, tried the Bobbie and it was awesome!  Expect a tryptophan nap right after though, cuz it's Thanksgiving dinner in between buns.  And those buns can range from 6 inches to 20! (that's what she said).  The Capastrami was also good.   The market seems pretty saturated when comes to sandwich chains, but these unique sandwiches will make me go back.  Eat up!"}
{"text":"I genuinely stop in here on my lunch break pretty good customer service sometime wait can be extensive when pressed for time but biting into one of their chicken cheesesteak .... party n my mouth YEA !! Yesterday a mistake was made on my sandwich i called in 'no problem'' will take care of u next visit . Went on todays lunchbreak sandwich was waiting when i arrived granted it wasnt hot was a little disappointing but none the less it was good and appreciated . Lady that usually works register n wears glasses very friendly assisted me with the app now im basically a Capaddict !"}
{"text":"Is there really any doubt? As a Jersey boy there's NOTHING like finding an EAST COAST SUB that doesn't ask if you want mayonnaise or mustard on it. If you don't understand that... Then just unfriend me now. LOL"}
{"text":"Such a tasty sandwich- other sandwich shops do not compare! I usually get the grilled italian and order olives, tomatos and pickles to it! So good and the veggies give it an extra crunch. My fiance usually orders the capistrami and it is so good that I might get it next time!  Not very healthy if that is what you are looking for though! But definitely high on taste! yum yum!"}
{"text":"I love that Capriotti's is next to 7 eleven,  because it was a hit day to get a slurpee.  But most of all, the Cole turkey was delicious even the 2nd time around.  I love Capriotti's and would go to bat for them anytime.  Lol.  I can't wait to try their other signature sandwiches."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are delicious even when you order thru a third party delivery service we still got the great food and quick!"}
{"text":"If I could rate with half stars then this would be 3.5 stars from me. My wife is addicted to Capriotti's but I don't share the same joy. Being from Southern California you can't call the pastrami here a true pastrami sandwich. First off all the Capastrami comes with coleslaw and Russian dressing on it... YUK! The cheesesteak here I eat during the colder months but it as well can't be called a true cheesesteak. The cheesesteak here is more like crumbled beef and you wont find any whiz here to add to it either.  What I do like here is the Italian sandwich and the Italian Sausage. Sandwiches come in 3 sizes from small, medium and large. The large is 20 inches so you will need a appetite or someone to share with.  Italian Sandwich..... Has  genoa salami, capacolla and prosciutini. You can have all the standard stuff added to it like pickles, onions, lettuce etc. I like the sweet crushed peppers on this sandwich they have a pickled flavor but a nice kick too.   Italian Sausage Sandwich..... Has grilled sausage and marinara sauce and provolone. This is a really good sandwich.  Catering is offered here and delivery if you order at least 2 sandwiches."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Capastrami! They are always made right in front of you, fresh ingredients and the customer service is great:)"}
{"text":"Capistrami great as always.   The service end... No friendly greeting, basically ignored for 5 minutes until they even ask if I needed to order. And no, it wasn't busy at all. The older man named James, who seemed to be in charge, rang me up while refusing to take my $3 off survey code cause it was from another store. Doesn't say anywhere on there it has to be used at the same store, and I've been allowed to do it at other stores. Guess I'll be avoiding this location.   Also, the employees usually say thanks out loud when tipped... Either they didn't get tipped the entire time while I ate my sandwich there or they're just not appreciative of our business."}
{"text":"I called in an Italian sub today at 5:20pm. The guy that took my order was too lazy to list everything that comes with it like they usually do, just asked me what I didn't want on it, so I said everything is fine except no mustard. Well my sub was dry and tasted just horrible! No mayo, it's usually drenched in oils but not this time, oh and no sweet or hot peppers. Perhaps there needs to be some better training. I threw my sub away."}
{"text":"This is a chain and a good one at that. I had Philly Cheesesteak and it was very good. It's amazing how many places can get such a simple sandwich wrong, but Capriotti's does it right. My buddy says all their sandwiches are good and I believe him. It's worth the stop."}
{"text":"Just a suggestion; when I order a cheesesteak with provolone and onions and then I come and pick it up don't say a cheesecake no American no mushrooms no bell pepper, what the hell is that? Just confirm what I ordered and not tell me everything I didn't put on it. FYI a real cheesesteak from Philly doesn't have bell peppers or mushrooms and it's not call pepper relish it's called hoagie spread. Relish goes on a hotdog.  Als"}
{"text":"I visited yesterday, very nice friendly workers, clean, and beautiful space. I ordered a 'capastromi,' although my food was tasty I felt the sandwich was skimpy with the meat portions. I should never bite into a sandwich and only get slaw in that bite. And sadly that was the case. I also ordered chicken noodle soup and the both was delicious but I did not have hardly any chicken or noodles in my soup, just a few carrot slices. I could literally drink it through a straw.  I would come back, after all they just opened. If they fixed what I noticed it would easily get a 5 star rating from me."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my house and the sandwiches are yummy !! I get the cheese steak !"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other day and the food was awesome! Only issue was it lunchtime rush hour and it took a while. They had a lot of online pick up orders ahead of us. Next time we'll use the app and order ahead of time."}
{"text":"Sometimes Capriotti's can be a hit or a miss, and this one is certainly a HIT.  The new location and the decor make this one a bit Special, but it is the staff that makes this place great.  Most Capriotti's have people with great attitudes, but this one is the best so far.  It's a joy to come here for a great sandwich.    Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"First and last time going to this location. Or any capriottis at this point. Had a long nasty hair in my food."}
{"text":"The food is as good as any other Capriotti's but what made my experience was the service. My dad is VERY picky and every request he had, the servers helped him right away with a smile. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The veggie Cole turkey is delicious!! One of the best veggie sandwiches in town. The service is always really fast so it's great for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch and ended up waiting over 45 minutes for 2 sandwiches. Horrible service and waited too long for food that wasnt great either. Safe to say we wont be back."}
{"text":"I have two words for you; The Bobby.   Warning! Do not operate heavy machinery after eating this sandwich. You will be in the itis within 20 minutes.   Fresh baked french bread, succulent daily roasted turkey, stuffing, cranberries, and mayo give you a creamy and hearty sandwich.   The small, which is more than enough for me for two meals, rarely lasts until meal 2 as it's so freakin' delicious. I'll wrap up half of it and find myself picking at it.   I order extra mayo/extra cran (no additional charge) because otherwise, it's too dry for me. When people try mine with the extras, I've been told that it's too wet, so it's mostly my personal preference.   This location also sells TastyKake and Nothing Bundt Cake which are nice, light dessert options after such a heavy meal.   I haven't fallen in love with any of their other sandwiches. Whenever I got outside my comfort zone to try a new one, I always feel like I made the wrong decision and should have kept to my tried and true.   I love that they use plain butcher paper to wrap the subs. This way, you won't have ink smears on your hand if the sandwich goos out the side."}
{"text":"I'm happily impressed with the friendliness of the staff at this location.  The last time I ordered a takeaway sandwich, I used a survey receipt coupon (fill out a survey, get a few dollars off your next sandwich) and the lady behind the counter seemed genuinely pleased that I did that.  She also gave me a free brownie.  :)  I'm a sucker for bribes, especially when they consist of baked goods.    Still not too taken with the less-than-immaculate floors, but the sandwiches are on point and I haven't incurred any illnesses from eating them!  I'll continue to order my Bobbie until my body rebels in some form or another."}
{"text":"I've lived in Las Vegas for 8 years and discovered Capriottis very early on, I believe from a catered event.  I fell in love with the Capastrami and have ordered it ever since.  I've been to several locations and have even had it delivered from time to time from the Santa Fe Casino / Rancho Location.  Consistently delicious.  I have tried a couple other subs and I'm never disappointed.  This particular location has always had friendly staff and have been fast and efficient.  One of my Vegas favorites for sure."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is probably the best place to go to get a sandwich/sub.  I never heard of this place until I was in Vegas & almost everyone I talk to agrees.  Subway doesn't touch this place.  There is a lot to choose from but my favorite is the steak & cheese, also the turkey one with cranberry,  I forget what it's called but they will know if you ask them! They use to have a few deserts as well but no biggie.  The food is cooked relatively fast & the place is ok to eat in but I almost always get it to go."}
{"text":"Ordered the bobbie an cheese steak both sandwiches were great this capriottis is one of the better ones in vegas not like the shit hole on rainbow or the one on flamingo with all the tweakers working there, this capriottis is always clean, an my orders are always accurate"}
{"text":"I cannot BELIEVE that aIt couple of years ago, as a \"local\", as many times as I have demolished Capriotti's sandwiches, I never Yelped ONE TIME about them.  Not ONCE.  I guess I was content to let my repeat visits do the talking for me.  So, we moved away to SF.  And now, here we are, back again, another year and a half or so later.  And yesterday, going to the N. Town Center Drive shop and biting into a medium Capistrami, was like visiting an old friend you haven't seen in a while, and picking back up again like you'd only seen each other just yesterday.  Oh, Capriotti's, how I've missed you.  Next time I stop by again, I'm gonna say 'hi' to Bobbie, with the turkey, cranberry and stuffing goodness.  And EXTRA mayo.  Sometimes, coming up with ways to explain why one falls in love with life in Vegas makes it a hard thing. But Capriotti's?  One taste, and no explanation is needed..."}
{"text":"Great location. Use to come here for lunch all the time and the service is awesome. The staff is really kind along with the owners who work there. Food is always worth the trip down there and they always make my chicken cheesesteak with the love it gets. Highly recommended location!"}
{"text":"Probably the nicest Capriotti's I have ever been to. Newly opened on Blue Diamond and has lots of patio seating.   We popped in to pick up dinner and walked out with 4 sandwiches: large Philly cheesesteak with extra peppers, Italian sub, meatball sub and a capistrami with extra hot peppers.   All delicious and made perfectly. On the wall they have a pic of meatball subs that makes your mouth water (also the reason I got a meatball sub).   Thank you for a nice visit, will be back again!"}
{"text":"The people are cool, sandwiches are below average. We get the same thing each time we go. Chicken Cheese steak. One with no onions and the other with extra cheese and extra onion. Either one of the two happens. They put onions on the one we asked not too or they give me the driest sandwich in which I asked for extra cheese. They need to send the people from the Cap store across from the hard rock and teach these people how to make great sandwiches. I will no longer come to this location. PS- I want my beer money back."}
{"text":"Let me just start off with, I'm not typically a fan of pastrami sandwiches - I always thought they were boring, dry and salty. That being said, the Capastrami hot sandwich was a great one.  It's a soft hot sandwich stuffed with moist pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, Russian dressing, and cole slaw. Sm: $7.79 Med: $8.99 Lg: $13.79  My boyfriend and I shared the medium and it was more than enough. We would probably stick with sharing a small next time.   It was a soft, warm and moist sandwich, but the cole slaw gave it a great cold crisp texture and the Russian dressing which tastes like a homemade sweeter thousand island dressing, added a nice sweetness to the sandwich.   I'm a saucy girl, so I asked them for an extra side of the Russian dressing to spread on my sandwich. I also asked for a side of sweet peppers and piled them into my sandwich and it turned it from good to amazing. So much better with sweet peppers in every bite! I loved it.   A side tip to save a few, grab your sandwich and then hop next door to buy your drink. The big gulp from 711 is 99 cents!"}
{"text":"First time in place.  This one is attached to a gas station.  I had a free sandwich coupon so I was going to benefit of the doubt.  I ordered a sausage sandwich.  The sausage was kind of dry.  The marinara sauce had good flavor.  I asked to get everything on it and I expected grilled onions and peppers.  Nope.  Sandwich was okay for the most part but if I'd paid $6.50, I would have been dissappointed."}
{"text":"Not sure why the lower reviews. I purposely skip the one is southern highlands to come here and it's right by my house. I have eaten here about 6 times and every time my food is on point. Very consistent"}
{"text":"I got straight food poisoning from this place last night. Only thing I ate because I've been at the hospital across the street while my girlfriend is in labor and I'm at the hospital(Summerlin) with her having stomach problems. Not going to go in to details but you get my point."}
{"text":"Unable to complete a sandwich order with any accuracy. Routinely puts the incorrect cheese, condiments, adds items I asked not be added (onions etc. ). Stuck at the office now eating a dry turkey sandwich with neither of the condiments I asked for on it."}
{"text":"When I complained to my brother about missing out on turkey dinner at Thanksgiving (especially the left-over sandwiches the next day!), he told me about Capriotti's sandwich called the Bobbi...THANK YOU, brother dear!  My daughter came with me and we ordered the large Bobbi sandwich (see photo).  If I remember correctly, it's 24\" long!  It was loaded with fresh turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce on the longest, freshest, most delicious sandwich roll I've ever seen and tasted.   The large Bobbi served my daughter and I, and then her boyfriend (we took a lot of it home to him) and all of us were very satisfied and full.   I would like to go back and try other sandwiches, but I don't know if I will be able to order anything but that Bobbi, it was sooooo good!"}
{"text":"One of the 3 Capriotti's in town that's actually good! I always order pick up for lunch & it's never disappointed! I always get the same thing cheesesteak with onions and hot peppers. Also sometimes it's a little too salty, it's usually always on point! Had a cookie today and it was soooooo good! Soft baked chocolate chip. Connected to a gas station, this location is really clean. I've tried out a few other locations throughout town and honestly hate to say , but they've been a pretty big let down. From food that just doesn't taste good, to dirty locations. This place is definitely my favorite!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed when eating at Cap's. I usually place my order in advance for pickup because it's usually packed especially for the lunch rush. Staff is friendly at all locations and food is great!"}
{"text":"Came here after work to stop off and grab a sand which. There ended up being a little bit of confusion. So I had to wait a little bit longer which was no trouble I didn't have anywhere to be. But the manager ended up giving everybody two free subs for next time. This is a great example of what good customer service is. They made a little bit of a mistake but definitely made up for it."}
{"text":"Always a good cheesesteak! It's not hot roast beef like some of these places try to pass off as steak. What is that about anyway??? Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in town I go here at least once a month to pick up a quick dinner for the family before running to a little league game"}
{"text":"We love their sandwiches!!! If you haven't tried the salads those are a must. You can even specialize it to your taste. I don't like meat on my salads so they added extra veggies for me. The dressings aren't great but, the cranberry vinaigrette was a lot better then I expected."}
{"text":"delish.  cheese steak. to die for  i always get the same thing so i cant speak to any other sandwich BUT i havent met a person who doesnt like this place  i've been to 3 LV locations and theyre all amazing this one is great, easily accessible, enough room inside, clean, friendly.  i'm salivating just thinking about it"}
{"text":"Right across the street from my work always very convenient. They are always super busy so I call and order ahead of time. Love the employees always happy and smiling =) thanks for always taking care of me in a short amount of time!"}
{"text":"Much like Arya Stark repeats the names of those she seeks murderous revenge against to help her fall asleep; when I am in bed, I say the words \"Homemade Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo\" over and over in hopes that one day I shall come across the one known as The Bobbie, and seek to satisfy the desires of my taste buds.   I came across The Bobbie while on adventures in the village of Las Vegas, and it was there, that I encountered a truly delectable specimen. One whose melding of savory sweet flavors has kept me awake many a night, seeking to once again rejoice in a reunion of the senses. Some day, we shall meet again, and I shall once again slay The Bobbie, enjoying every second of it.  Homemade Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo. Homemade Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo. Homemade Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo."}
{"text":"I use to love Capriotti's especially this location it was always the best! Unfortunately I can no longer recommend any Capriotti's. I always get the same thing everything (Philly cheese steak) and I would eat it two to three time's a week. For some reason Capriotti's started to become incredibly inconsistent a lot of the times the meat in the Philly would be unedible, very squishy or hard to the point where I would have to split the food out because I couldn't do it and I would have this happen just about every other time and but it only started a few months ago.. I've also had food poisoning from the Philly on two separate occasions but I kept going back but the inconsistency of the cooked meat made me finally say enough is enough and I will never step foot in any Capriotti's again."}
{"text":"What can I say?? A great sandwich every time!! The Bobbie is such a tasty one as well as the savory Cheese Steak!! This place is where I enjoy going quite often."}
{"text":"I am a true Capriotti's fan. I have eaten at almost all the locations in town. I eat at this location every week and sometimes twice a week. When I walk in they know me by name and are always friendly.   This location on Town Center is attached to a gas station.  it has plenty of room inside unlike the other locations to sit and enjoy one of their tasty options.The one thing I have noticed is that not each location is consistent with how the food comes out. This location is.   I do know they hand make each meatball everyday for the meatball subs. I have only tried the meatball once and personally wasn't a fan.   If you have never had a \"Bobbie\" then please try it at least once. If you love a Thanksgiving meal then you will really love this one. When people complain about it not being hot or not having gravy I wonder why they came here and ordered a bobbie?! There are lots of places that have a similar sandwich but Capriotti's invented the one and only bobbie and it doesn't come hot or with gravy!  The Capastrami (my fav) is perfect. When I order it I know it will be to perfection and each bite heaven. I have eaten two this week!  I never ever have an issue with the Italian sub. It is just a winner every time and perfect if you are heading up to Red Rock for some hiking as a picnic lunch.   The Wise chips are a very excellent addition to your sandwich. The \"Honey BBQ\" is what I like to get when they aren't sold out.  You can call ahead your order for pick up. That is what I usually do because lines can be very long especially during lunch.    They cater."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and service is always friendly and quick.  The one time I had a bit of a wait the manager apologized and gave me a coupon for a free sub.  The sandwiches themselves are really good and a good value.  It's the closest one to me and even though it's in a gas station 7-11, it's still one of the best I have been to."}
{"text":"Tried this location and still wasn't impressed. Although it is a 1000x better than the location off of So Hi pkwy & Valley View. I ordered two sandwiches on two different occasions and both were pretty much inedible. The Grilled Italian and the Homemade Tuna were both so awful!! I took a couple bites and threw them away. Maybe it's due to new people, new store? I'm not sure, but it's very disappointing. We need good food options on this side of town."}
{"text":"Right next to my work, and that is the way I like it! They take note to whatever extra instructions I place on there. They are super quick, at least when I go there. I order online, perhaps that has something to do with it. They are right inside with the 7-11, which I personally love. The staff is friendly; I have always been greeted. This is a great location, but I generally enjoy all other locations as well."}
{"text":"Was back in town recently visiting the old neighborhood and decided to drop in here for a bite to eat.  I miss Capriotti's, so it was nice to be able to taste my fav....the Capastrami....yum!  I like this location because it's usually not too busy, so I can find a place to sit down and grub.  The Capastrami was as good as I remembered it....heaven!  Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"Was meaning to try this place for a while. Finally tried it. Was not worth the wait. I don't know what meats they used for their Italian sub, but one looked like roast beef. Roast beef should not be on a traditional Italian sub. Bun and lettuce were soggy and fried onions had no flavor. Sub was just blah. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Employees are nice, place is clean, food is good."}
{"text":"Few days ago, my husband and I went there for lunch.  i had some kind of vegetarian sandwich ( it's so memorable, I can't remember the name). It was supposed to be fake meat and cheese.  I could hardly see the cheese... the sandwich was absolutely tasteless, no taste whatsoever. i had no idea what I was eating.  my husband had the pastrami and it was nothing to write home about.  overall, I find this place expensive. And for a tasteless sandwich, it was price-less. Not going back to any capriotti!!!!"}
{"text":"Have to agree with the other reviewers.  Food isn't worth the price.  I got the cheese steak, asked for meat and cheese only and still had onions and peppers in it.  Once my sandwich was finished cooking it took 5 or so minutes for someone to finally hand me it."}
{"text":"I miss the personal service of yelling out my order. Now it's wait in line order at a cash register like every place else. Bring back the uniqueness that we all have grown up with. Don't fall in line with corporate stores and lemmings lifestyle."}
{"text":"You will get stuck on hold for over 10 minutes and your online delivery will be late. Ridiculous. Would not recommend this branch"}
{"text":"Trash cans over flowing behind the counter with four employees working......immediate eye sore. All employees were nice, but appeared to not have a sense of urgency nor did they go out of their way to toss a smile or a hello agter the order was made......made for a wait a tad too long. Dining area was neat and clean. Kind of hard to mess up a sandwich, this place is usually good."}
{"text":"Everyone needs a sandwich.  Infused into the gas station this business has a nice little thing going. I've had quite a few sandwich from here after filling up on gas. Each time the staff have been pleasant and respectful.  I will say that few times I've called ahead for sandwiches they have been dry or cold. But on the whole the Philly steak sandwiches are great. I'll always be repeat here"}
{"text":"Great staff and clean establishment. Maryanne was amazingly kind and quick. It's a great spot to pick up a quick sandwich. Fell in love with Cap'n when I was a senior in high school and volunteered at a place that ordered Capriotti's for catering. The Bobbie is Amaaaaazing."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches.  You also order ahead of time. Staff is great. Would highly recommend the Bobbie, cheese steak or capristrami sandwich. Also great to get for work for catering."}
{"text":"The finest steak and cheese in or out of Philadelphia, there I said it! Now the only reason to go to Philly is to visit Benjamin Franklin's grave. Also the \"Capastrami\" is unreal. Great staff. The only other thing I can add is that this place is painfully good. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"I LITERALLY ate some dinner- saw a gyro and cheesesteak place and got the idea for a cheese steak- didn't really like it- HAD to finish up the night correctly- drove to my nearby Capriottis to get another Cheese Steak- this time from a place I knew wouldn't disappoint"}
{"text":"Good for a sandwich shop. Reasonably priced and meat doesn't taste processed. Service and staff at this location always friendly"}
{"text":"This location seems to have the friendliest staff out of any location I've been to.  You are greeted when you walk in the door and you made to feel welcome by everyone.  Nina was awesome and did a great job making my sandwiches the way I requested.  I believe Matt was the gentleman's name who is the manager I dealt with on my first visit and he is AWESOME.  The manager sets the tone for the rest of the staff and Matt's personality definitely reflects in the rest of the staff.  I highly recommend this location and if you go in when it's busy, be patient and understanding that the staff is doing their best to keep everyone happy.  It sometimes unfortunately does not work out that way but from what I've observed on my visits is that they try and that's all you can ask for.  I will be back.."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, a Las Vegas standy."}
{"text":"Yummy,Yum,Yum! First great sign Capriotti's restaurant was clean. Next I'm greeted with friendly smiles and a helpful staff .Cool. cool. Thanks Melissa and the guy working with her. I just love a pleasant atmosphere. Next we ordered \"The Bobbie\" and \"Tuna\" sandwiches to go. Less than a 5 minute wait, bam my name is called ,my food is ready, sweet. I pay get my sandwiches and to the homestead I go.   All righty , we unwrap our sandwiches and take our first bite  OMG! So delicious \"the Bobbie\" is Thanksgiving on a very soft hoagie roll. You have your turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing I'm so thankful for this sandwich being a menu staple. Husband had the tuna and all positive feedback from him. If you are in the mood for fresh ingredients and different sandwiches such as the bobbie or pastrami along side the normal, then Capriotti's is the place for you. I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"First impressions are the most important.  I am so glad I stopped by this location. The lady that runs the front counter is so freaking funny.  I didn't know what to order when I got there. I saw Italian sausage and I just went for it.  It comes with marinara sauce, onions, and bell peppers.   The subs are above average they definitely have a better taste and the onions were so freaking good.   The location is very clean attached to a 7-11."}
{"text":"Italian sausage sub was great, wife's \"Bobby\" was great. Only mark down is hokey pay/order location being a mess while you're ordering/paying later. Wait seems a little long but worth it. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"This location is close to my house.  I can call in an order and pick it up on my way home from work.  My favorites are the meatball sub and the cheese steak.  The staff have been consistently courteous and efficient.  The store has been consistently clean in the dining area.  The high counter tops make it impossible for me to see the cooking area apart from what is visible by the cash register.  This location is attached to the convenience store; which also has a mini USPS and gas station.  There is outside seating with umbrellas as well as the indoor dining area.  I cannot recall if there is a television for customers to watch as my food orders have always been take out."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge sandwich fanatic but my hubby's work is right across the street from this place so he is a frequent customer here.  Last night he brought home his leftovers.  Half of a homemade turkey sub.  Wow.  I was surprised by how good it was.  The bread is perfectly soft and chewy.  And the turkey is real turkey.  Not deli meat.  In fact I was so enamored that I asked him to bring me my own sandwich on his way home from work today.  So today we tried The Bobby.  O-M-G.  Homemade turkey, stuffing, and cranberry.  SO GOOD!  I think I could eat it everyday.  Seriously.  What a great lunch/dinner option.  I'm so excited by the discovery of this place.  I can't wait to try their warm sandwiches.  I don't think I can ever go back to Subway or Port of Subs."}
{"text":"My friend had raved about these sandwiches being amazing. They did not disappoint. The service was quick and friendly. The bread was perfect! They even offer tasty cakes as a dessert. The only thing that I would have liked is if they would have offered a 5\" or 6\" option."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to this location but was near here for a meeting. Got what I always get which is steak and cheese. I had chips and when I asked for a bag the clerk literally threw the bag at me. Never even opened the plastic bag. Got home with the sandwich and it had absolutely no taste. The steak was overcooked and hard.  After a couple of bites, I just through the sandwich away. Definitely will not return to this location and for the prices will probably not go to any of their stores. Their food is not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"This location is very friendly and quick. I have ordered the turkey sub a several times, and the last two times the meat has been non existent. Not sure what is happening, but at the prices of subs, I expect a full sandwich."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for several years now when I'm in town and have always had a great sandwich. This year I've been trying new items instead of my usual mushroom cheese steak. The Bobby is excellent (thx giving dinner on a bun) and so is the capastrami. I've also tried their hamburgers and plain old roast beef sandwiches on plain old bread. I love it all."}
{"text":"Ate from here for the first, and probably last, time tonight.  I ordered the Bobbie and it was ice cold. I saw another Yepler mentioned that, so I was prepared to nuke it. But why would they serve it like that? They should offer to heat it for you upon request. My husband took a bite of my sandwich, and pulled a bendable piece of plastic out of his mouth! He got the castrami and said it was just meh. Too bad, we were looking for a new sandwich spot."}
{"text":"My son told me they has this sandwich that makes you think if thanksgiving, needless to say its august and I was at the red rock to see a show.  I went and night a Bobbie sandwich which is what they are famous for, I was very disappointed.  I thought it would be a hot or warm sandwich it was cold even the bread was cold?? Do they premarital these or so you use all cold ingredients?  I went back and asked If they had a microwave or something so I can warm mg sandwich. They told me that didn't have anything except the grill. Well he discourage any way if him grilling it.  I got it but I feel that sandwich would taste better warm. Not refrigerator cold.  Very disappointed and would not get this sandwich again."}
{"text":"I love this Capriotti's location. I come here at least once a week for my boss.   The employees are always nice and helpful.   The restaurant is clean and orderly.   I like that you get to watch them make the food in front of you, you know it's fresh.   Anytime you tip they ALWAYS remember to say \"beer money guys\" even if they're extremely busy. It always makes me smile to hear it.   Phone ordering is just as easy and my food is always ready when I get there.   I have never received a messed up order from this location.   Thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Drove from San Diego today & had a piece of heaven tonight!  I saddened me when Caps closed in San Diego. I had the cole turkey & my hubby had the giant grilled Italian. The staff were super friendly as well!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I love sandwiches so much. Maybe it's the bread. Or maybe its the whole eating with your hands thing. I used to go to Subway but Subway needs to step it up because Port of Subs has eclipsed them, and I also have enjoyed Capriotti's.  I used to come here on my way home from work and order a salad or a sandwich. I've also ordered delivery from them. The Bobbie is Thanksgiving on bread and fun to eat. They don't have a whole lot of variety, though. I'm never able to order anything hot at this location.    So, this place is like a diner - no, it's one of those holes-in-the-wall places. But it's bright and clean, and the staff have always been very friendly. It's a nice place."}
{"text":"For a sub shop that makes a sub with all the Thanksgiving fixins,(the Bobbie) it gets my thumbs up time and time again.    I called in my order and went to go pick it up.  They had it ready when I walked in.  The convenience of calling in the order ahead of time is such a time saver especially if I only have a few minutes in-between meetings.  Melissa took my order and was quick to greet me when I arrived to pick up my sub sandwiches.   If you never tried a Bobbie sub with turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce, I suggest you try one, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to Capriotti's as it's right down the street. Are usually call in my order the staff here is very friendly it's always waiting by the time I get there it's nice and simple nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Oh, I really wish I wouldn't have discovered this place. Tried different locations around town with the same great results. Love their sandwiches. i dream about em I swear.   Love the Capastrami and the Bobby is very good too. Their sandwiches remind me of the grinders at this little joint that we ate at while we were in college.(So many years ago that my memory may be fading) Oooey gooey yummy!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop in town! The capastromi is a must try! It is very filling and flavorful. Although you can't go wrong with the sloppy joe either. You really feel like you got your money's worth."}
{"text":"Well this was the first time trying this place since they just opened not long ago. We wanted to try something different so we ordered the half sub and soup special. I thought it was expensive if you ask me. It was like $9. So it was over $20 with 2 specials and a drink. It didn't even fill you up for that kind of money! The soup comes in a small container and the sub is very small for being a half. Very disappointed in how much came on the sub. They make them with their back to you and you can not see the items they put on and they don't even ask what you want on it. They just proceed to make it the way they want. I can honestly say you get so much more for your money at Subway for much less and you can make the sub the way you want and you get very full and sometimes even have leftovers! The soup was hot and had a good flavor but such a small container and they fill just above half. We didn't get much at all. Over all not our favorite sub place. Not happy. Not sure if we would go back here."}
{"text":"The guy behind the counter was funny and chatted with us, and gave us a discount for being NY sports fans ;) The sandwiches were large and stuffed well, and quick to be made. The service was great and I would eat there again to get away from the expensive places in the resort."}
{"text":"Capriottis is YUM. Every sandwich I've had has been delightful. Capastrami is my current fave.   This location is amazing and by far our favorite. They are prompt, fast, friendly and give me stuffed sandwiches."}
