{"text":"Wonderful place for a special occasion celebration. My husband and I went to Sel last Thursday for our 26th anniversary and we're still commenting to everyone we know about how great this place is. You can tell from the taste of the food and presentation of each dish that the chef prepares the food with love and care. And Mike, who was both our waiter and the Sommelier, is fantastic! The wine pairings made each of the 4 courses a true experience for the senses. Sel is our new favorite local restaurant."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! If you like an intimate place with amazing cuisine , Sel is the place!  My husband and I have decided to come here for a date night once a month.  The food s absolutely the best !!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner 2 weeks ago. Absolutely amazing! Great service, modern beautiful dining room.  The food was delicious. The tasting menu is paced perfectly, and dishes were all delicious. Chef Levine is very creative with not only flavors, but presentation as well. Wine parings were also spot-on as well and I recommend getting them.  It is located in Scottsdale Art walk area. Great for a stroll after dinner or people watching while eating.  If you were miss Binkley's in Cave Creek since it closed, come here. You wont miss it any more I assure you. Were truly fortunate to have a place this wonderful,  in this city."}
{"text":"This was a great found!  We went there for our friend's birthday.  And we had 4 courses pre fix menus for $80. Everything on the menu are very interesting and unique.  Every single dishes are amazing and services are great!  We all had a great time!  I would love to go back there again and again.  And I would recommend this restaurant for any occasions!"}
{"text":"We were introduced to Sel by the chef who founded Café Monarch, and (as ever) his recommendation was flawless.  A superb fixed price four course menu, sensibly priced, great cocktails to start and an excellent selection of wine made for a very enjoyable meal.  The décor is fabulous, and we were fortunate to be visiting at a time where we could sit outside and enjoy the evening.  We'll be back :-)"}
{"text":"One of the best places we have been to.  Love the ambiance and the decor.  Everything was planned and prepared in good, classy taste.  The food was superb and the serving was just right.  The service was excellent...right timing, not intrusive but making sure that everything was to our liking.  The Goose liver was so delicious like it melts in your mouth.  We will be back for sure for more.."}
{"text":"Really blown away by this restaurant. The food is amazing. Superb chef! I enjoyed everything I had on their four course tasting menu. Truly unique flavor combinations. Delicious!"}
{"text":"What an amazing addition to the restaurant scene in Scottsdale. This new restaurant stunned with phenomenal tastes, textures, and presentation, all in a very classy and upbeat environment. The head chef is from highly acclaimed Cafe Monarch, and he has cooked overseas and competed on TV with Bobby Flay; really impressive! But again the proof was in the pudding, and his inventive dishes with incredible tastes really surprised!  Loved the outdoor seating area in Old Town, and sophisticated look inside. The cocktails are WOW, but you have to try it all to see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Great steak and cocktails! Would definitely go again -Recommend the bone in RibEye-Yum!"}
{"text":"Yelped for a date night spot and found Sel with a deserving 5 stars! Everything was delicious and presented perfectly! You have to try!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue, but well worth it. The food here was great, but even more so, the service was impeccable.  Our water glasses were always full, the cocktails were perfect, and I swear our server was more delighted and excited about the flavors we were going to experience than we were. It would have been a great meal anyway, but the people who were taking care of us and going to extra mile to explain everything with nothing less than pure enthusiasm -- everything from the ambiance of the restroom to the how the citrus flavor in the side dish was achieved -- was the thing that will make it unforgettable. Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Holy Cow!  Stunning meal. By far the best Filet I have ever eaten. Brandon (chef and owner) and Josh (Som and Bar Master) are in a league of their own. It all starts with Brandon's skill infusing flavors and mixing textures and creating sauces that are second to none. The service was Platinum Level. Josh was super enthusiastic about all things food and drink. The ambiance was perfect for a date. The music was pure Rhythm or MoTown (my favs) out of the 70'a. The sound dampening in the dining room made for easy conversation throughout the night. This place is a hidden jewel in downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I went with a party of 6 last night for an anniversary dinner. From soup to nuts it was a fantastic experience. This is the kind of restaurant where you don't need to understand the menu. Just order and enjoy. The chef has you covered. So yes...the salad might have anchovy dressing and that might sound like fish salad but seriously Chef Levine will not serve you fish salad. It was amazing and I don't even like anchovies. The staff were all professional and helpful. The presentation was beautiful. The courses came out perfectly timed so we didn't feel rushed to finish one thing before moving on to the next. I'm already looking forward to our next dinner there."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best meals we've had since moving to Phoenix. The waitstaff are very  professional and courteous in their recommendations, which really helped set the tone for the entire evening. The cocktail menu is fresh and interesting and best of all, it pairs nicely with the food. We opted for the prix fixe menu and were not disappointed; if you can get the foie gras add-on, do it, it is well worth it. The stuffed squash blossom and chilled cucumber soup were so welcome and refreshing to eat on a 113 degree day that I hope the chef keeps variations of these on his menu for the entire summer. The duck breast I ordered was scored and perfectly cooked- delicious soaked in its jus. Oh yes, and definitely save room for dessert! on this menu they offered a strawberry marzipan shortcake that really puts all other shortcake to shame.   I expect that in a very short time this restaurant will be difficult to get into, so we will be visiting as often as we can this summer."}
{"text":"We decided to try Sel for our anniversary and we were elated with the experience.   In fact, we had a phenomenal time from the moment we arrived. The entire staff is polished, yet so friendly and welcoming, which is definitely not the case with many Old Town restaurants    One after another, Chef Levine's courses were unbelievable.   Fine dining at its pinnacle!"}
{"text":"We happened, quite by chance, to be the first customers after the pre opening festivities.  Unknowingly, we were in for an incredible and very lucky surprise!  This place will fill up fast once word gets out!  We had the scallops and halibut main course, and both were absolutely amazing!  Simple yet sophisticated ambience, and the staff was gracious, professional and very friendly!  The owner said they considered opening in Chicago, where we are from, and do we wish they had!  Scottsdale, you are one lucky city to have this new gem!"}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of Chef Branden Levine's succulent and unique dishes. Sel definitely takes his impeccable skills at its highest level. All the dishes were excellent, from the quality, freshness, presentation and taste. Every ingredient is palate worthy. The Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras is a must try. It comes in a generous portion and is just a party of delicious flavors.  Another favorite is  the panko crusted Aslaskan halibut. The fish is so fresh that it melts in your mouth and is just simply divine. The ambiance and location is perfect. Set amidst the heart of Old Town Scottsdale's art district, it offers such a great experience to the diner with a spacious patio dining area to boot. The cocktails are amazing! I would say that they are the best that I have ever had. My favorite is the Baiser Francais with its twist of the flowery taste of the chamomile syrup as well as The Harry Nilsson with just the right amount of coconut liqueur to give that refreshing and savory taste. Sel has a great staff who have all been highly experienced in the restaurant world. Meet celebrity chef Branden Levine and see who and what everyone has been talking about!"}
{"text":"Pricey and too rich. As other people have mentioned, I thought that our dining experience would be romantic, flavorful and intimate in a similar fashion like Monarch Cafe. Similar pricing and style of eating, but Sel doesn't hold a flame in comparison. I wanted so badly to like this place, especially since I picked it as the setting for my boyfriend's birthday, however, I was disappointed. Every course tasted like the last. And although my boyfriend and I ordered different items for our fourth course, they tasted the same. I would likely not return as the price point and quality of taste and ambiance is just not there. The plastic, cheap chairs outside are tacky and uncomfortable. The martinis were small. The food was not memorable. And my wallet took a hit. Not worth it."}
{"text":"New upscale modern American Cusine at Sel Restaurant in Scottsdale! Location perfect, food extraordinary and an elevation in dining! Chef Branden Levine has a way of combining flavors and turn it into art! Plus he almost beat Bobby Flay!! http://youtu.be/HF8z9fYH0iA #TravelConciergeCorner #AGirlFriday #TravelGal"}
{"text":"Dining at Sel is one of my top 2 dining experiences. It was the perfect blend of amazing food, relaxed yet professional service, and cool decor. A new menu comes out every month, if I lived in Phoenix I would return each month to enjoy the new menu. By the way, my other top dining experience was at L'effervescence in Tokyo last November.  I highly recommend Sel!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Chef Levine so when \"SEL\"opened I had to go check it out. Went Saturday evening for dinner and we absolutely loved it! The GF did the 4 course and I ordered a la carte. It worked out quite well because we got to taste a little bit of everything. You must try the Froi Gras, Rabbit and Ceviche. I have to admit, I'm usually not as adventurous to try those plates(Froi Gras & Rabbit) but I'm glad I did. They were delicious. The cocktails were great too. Thank you guys for a great evening."}
{"text":"This was the grand finale to our Christmas dining adventures. It was perfect. We actually arrived much earlier than we intended and the restaurant wasn't open yet. So we browsed some of the nearby art galleries for a while and returned about 10 minutes before we thought was their opening time. As we were waiting outside the chef was arriving and asked if he could help us. We told him we were just waiting until they were open. He told us it would be about 40 minutes (not 10). So we figured we would just go look at more art. As we started away he stopped us and said, \"But you're welcome to sit out on the patio and I'll send a bartender out to take your drink order.\" We were delighted. It was the beginning of a special evening. You can see from the photos what we ordered. Nothing was anything less than spectacular and the service was outstanding. This is one of the best restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"What a great new addition to the Valleys finest restaurants. Although only open for a couple weeks we enjoyed an impeccable meal on par with Kai and Binkleys. Our meals were beautifully presented with great taste to match. The restaurant itself is gorgeous and the service first rate. When Sel gets reviewed and the word gets out reservations will be hard to come by.  Our mains, the succulent Halibut and perfect filet were just that - perfect! We shared the one dessert offered and it was decadent, a strawberry marzipan shortcake. Sel has become our go to fine restaurant for impressing our out-of-town guests, or for any other excuse we can make to get there."}
{"text":"Very good ambiance, service, and amazing food. The duck is cooked and seasoned really well. Love!"}
{"text":"I would have loved to post a picture of my amazing meal but sadly it was so good but we ate every last bite before I thought to! I am an AZ native and I can truthfully say this has to be the best dining experience we have had in my hometown, and yes even better than the big names. Please do yourself a huge favor and make your way over here to this new gem. I know we will be regulars now!"}
{"text":"My husband & I were staying at the Fairmont Princess and saw a great article in a \"Scottsdale\" magazine about this place and saw how close it was so we decided to try it. DELICIOUS! We both loved our meals. it was a Pre Fixe dinner & being a bumpkin I was a little intimidated by some of the offerings but my husband assured me it was all going to be delicious and he was right. The roasted sweet corn soup is mouthwatering! The compressed melon salad was amazing! For the Entree I had the Duck. I have had duck MANY times but this was truly the best I have ever had.  The atmosphere was very metropolitan and we loved it.  I would absolutely highly recommend Sel and don't be a chicken and order the a - la - carte! haha."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect.  Service was exquisite and very attentive. Restaurant was spotless. Food was creative, perfectly plated and delicious.   This is definitely a must for anyone who likes fine dining.  Do not miss!"}
{"text":"Went to Sel for a special occasion so it was well worth the price.  The restaurant is neat and clean. It is small so the tables are a smidge close. The servers were attentive and top notch. The menu is pretty exotic with foods you don't see many places. Everything was well prepared."}
{"text":"I am 47 years old, and the dinner I had at Sel was the BEST FOOD I have ever eating in my life!   3 of the 5 courses were each...the best food I have ever eaten.  The best bowl of soup, the best steak, the best appetizer in my life!   The other two dishes were just amazing.   What I loved was the complexity of flavor, the combinations were unique, interesting, completely new, and just plain delicious.     Have you ever seen a work of art or heard music that you knew was the work of a master?  That's the way I felt my dinner was - the work of a master.  My wife and I were absolutely blown away.  All we could talk about was how amazing our dinner was. I will absolutely be back soon.   :)"}
{"text":"Service was terrible from every employee Including the chef and his wife!The restaurant stinks,the food is no good and way over priced. I would not recommend this place to anyone.The place is dirty and my dish was not cleaned properly and neither was my silverware.This kind of place needs to be shutdown."}
{"text":"Not understanding the strong 5's. Especially for this price point.  Wine pairing was off. It almost feels like people are giving the high rating because of how much the dinner cost. Friday night 8:30pm peak season and we were the only patrons.  Ambiance isn't great food mediocre, and wait staff has no clue what is being served.  I would be surprised if this restaurant was open 12 months from now"}
{"text":"After hearing countless rave reviews for Sel we finally had the opportunity to try it out when we had out-of-town visitors.  There were 3 of us and we all had the 4 course prix fixe menu and our visitor only enjoyed one of the four courses - the salad.  For our guest's first course, she chose a mushroom dish with goat cheese risotto.  I thought it was good, but she didn't enjoy it at all.  She and I both had the king crab for our second course.  The menu did say that it would come served with fish roe and an asparagus puree, but when the dish was served, it had way too much roe and coupled with the crab and asparagus it tasted almost like spoiled fish tastes.  We gave feedback to the server and he brought out ONE serving of the alternate second course, the duck confit ravioli which was better.  The third course was the salad and that was fine.  For the entree, I had the Wagyu hangar steak with a reduction sauce.  The reduction tasted burnt and incredibly salty - so salty that that became the only thing I could taste in the dish.  A Wagyu cut of meat should be very tender, but this hangar steak was tough and was the consistency of any hangar steak you could buy at the grocery store.  Our guest had the Crispy Skin Sea Bass.  Sea Bass we've had at other fine restaurants is very mild with almost no ocean flavor or harsh fishy taste.  Unfortunately, the bass, the sauce, and all the accompaniments were so fishy tasting that she couldn't eat the meal.  It was taken away from the table having only a few bites eaten.  We gave feedback to our server at the end of each course and he seemed genuinely interested in hearing it.  However when the bill came ($330 for three guests), there were no reductions, comps, or anything else taken off.  My fiance went to the server and said we didn't think that was fair considering that our guest only enjoyed the salad course and for me, two of my four courses were not up to par.  They brought the bill back, but it was exactly the same.  $330.  So we went to the manager and they reduced it by $60.  Not a fair offering, in my opinion.  Other restaurants of this caliber and price point would have taken back any unsatisfactory dishes and replaced them with something more suitable and then either reduced the bill or offered complimentary drinks or dessert or something.  Not at Sel. It was a huge disappointment and there are many other restaurants in town that are much better."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience. A hidden gem in Old Town! Chef is talented and creative. Service is outstanding. A great place for special occasions -staff really goes out of their way to celebrate with you and make the night memorable."}
{"text":"Incredible food! Chef Branden really knows what he's doing. Very innovate cuisine. We loved the patio with views of Main St. and the interior is very fresh and modern. There isn't anything like this place in Scottsdale and I'm sure it will be a big success."}
{"text":"This restaurant was fantastic.  The staff was great and the food was delicious.  The owner came out to ask us for feedback at the end as well. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We have a win. Sceptical as we were with a newborn  (less than a year old) we had to see what the  buzz is about. I couldn't get a prime  time reservation so opted for an early 5:45 dinner. When we arrived, we were the only guests. The restaurant never got to 50% capacity until 7. This irritated us until the owner visited the table and explained it is a kitchen size/production issue. Other than me being a baby about dinner time it was a 5 star experience. I recommend the prix fix as the menu is limited. Appetizers, supplements, main course es and deserts are creative, fresh, and delicious. Parking is tough but it is downtown with lots of tourists and galleries. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I don't do reviews very often but when our visit was based on Yelp reviews and it was not as described,  I have to give my honest take on it.   I took my husband here for his birthday. We had the 4 course dinner.   Menu - Very little options.  Taste - We liked the cocktails, shortcake dessert and that was it. From the appetizer to the entree it was all below average. Each dish was a mash up of flavors that did not work well together.  Service - Our server was knowledgeable and said he's worked at all the fine dining restaurants and this chef was the best. We had high expectations from there but dish after dish was a let down.  Cocktails - We both had a dirty vodka martini. It was good.  Atmosphere - Our reservation was at 6:30pm on a Saturday. The restaurant was empty. We sat at a table next to a window that was cracked all the way across. That was concerning that the restaurant can tolerate a broken glass window and still seat people next to it.  Cost - As expected for fine dining our bill was about $240 with tip.   Overall - We won't be going back. If you're looking for spectacular fine dining go to Binkley's or Kai. If you're in Vegas try e' inside the Cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"In a word: Disappointed. When you throw your hat into the fine dining tasting menu ring there are certain expectations. Sel falls short in every possible aspect.  The menu and food is promising and at times very tasty, however there were so many missteps detracting from the level of dining that was expected to let some occasionally very good food shine. I want to preface this by saying that I have dined at as many high end tasting menu restaurants as I can (French Laundry, Grace, Alinea, etc.) but also understand this is Phoenix and not New York or Chicago.  Service was atrocious.  From a server who told us that a wine pairing wasn't available because they had a \"very busy week\" whom I then had to listen to very carefully curate a wine selection for another table right over my shoulder while my glass was empty course after course... I'm trying to buy wine and you're making it difficult? What?   Continuing on the service, I had a second course come to the table then do an about face back to the kitchen when they saw our first course wasn't cleared yet. We had a third course arrive without any flatware to eat with. We had an empty wine glass sit on the table for three courses. I could go on, but this is a staff that is not ready for prime time.   Also virtually all of the dishes arrived colder than they should have, indicating they sat for a while on the window.  The menu is good, but makes horrible decisions regarding the supplements. You are allowed to add upwards of 4 courses to a 4 course menu, but none as upgrades to the current menu? How does this make sense? Am I supposed to be as full and content after an 8 course meal as I am your 4 course? And many items seemed misplaced, with 2 options for the first 3 courses and then (roughly) 8 for the 4th course... octopus and scallops should have been paired down and offered as a 2nd or 3rd.  Food: I'm open to creative options and love letting a good kitchen staff do they're thing, but I left feeling like they didn't care.  A Brussels Sprout and Beet salad was uninspired and something anyone could have bested in their home kitchen.  My venison 4th was severely undercooked (I wanted it medium rare, and wouldn't have minded it rare) it came as blue and as I've seen in any restaurant ever. It was \"brought up to temp\" but by that time in our meal, who cares? Certainly not the staff who made no effort or acknowledged in any way that this level of service or experience is less than what they are shooting for.  I would have much rather gone to a less ambitious place that did what they do well than this place that posits itself as fine dining and seems to have no idea what that means."}
{"text":"My wife took me to Sel to celebrate my birthday as adults. I was surprised to find out I had not heard of this place, be such a foodie and all. We started with a bottle of bubbly and the went for the four course wine pairing dinner. Everything was awesome. Much to my surprise, the chilled cantaloupe with poached lobster may have stole the show. (I can't stand cantaloupe, but this was perfectly seasoned and may have converted me.). I'm a huge duck breast and grilled octopus fan and both too were amazing. The wines were perfectly paired. Can't wait to go back with friends to see Chef Branden and Josh again."}
{"text":"Sel was superb from start to finish. The wait staff and hosts are attentive and friendly, and really took the time to explain each dish. I had the vegetarian tasting menu. The first item, a mushroom and lentil emulsion, was creamy and had delightful flavor notes in each bite. The potsticker and tofu gnocchi were also excellent, prepared with a lot of different elements. The only item I did not like was the salad. It had a stale custard crouton with run-of-the-mill overly dressed greens and tasted like a salad you might get at Denny's. I enjoyed the dessert immensely, which was a marzipan shortcake. I will definitely be back, as they change their menu every two weeks and always have a vegetarian tasting menu. All around a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"My husband had read the reviews of Sel and we decided to try it out.  Wow, what a disappointment!  The food was good, when it finally arrived, but the prices are not worth it, service was bad, and to force people into a tasting menu is counter productive.  Here is my breakdown:  Service: terrible!  We waited 45-1 hour between courses.  We asked for bread after 3 hours sitting and 3 course in (and still starving!) - it took 4 requests before the bread arrived.  We asked for tap water when our San Pellegrino was out, it never came.  Multiple waitstaff, bussers, hostesses etc came by to check in, but somehow none of them could get us bread or water?  Price: Ridiculous!  I am happy to spend $400 for dinner, great service, wine, and an amazing experience - non of that was here.  I had a late lunch and wasn't hungry enough to eat 4 courses, but the way the menu is structured, the price of 2 courses is basically the same as 4 ($80 vs $76 for 2 courses and the portions are the same!!).  They try to force you into having their 'experience tasting menu' when having the entree and one other course would be a much better experience.  Price each course as appropriate to the quality and let your guests choose what 'experience' they want.     Food:  my food, when it arrived (eventually) was good.  I had the 'chicken caesar' without the chicken skin, which was the best part of the meal.  The parmesan crisp with a bit of spice was great with the lettuce.  The brussel sprouts were good, but the same as anywhere else...  I had the salmon crudo (called something else on the menu) without the foie gras and it was OK - not worth $19 al la carte price.  The black cod was good, though not worth the $55 al la carte price.  Try this restaurant when they have sorted out their problems with staff and they restructure their menu to allow either a tasting menu or a meal as you choose."}
{"text":"my friends credit card was left after dinner, he called the next day and they said they had it. then he went back for it and they said they couldn't find it.. later that day  we found out it was stolen and used for 300$ at frys electronics and subway for $70.    Wow! This place really came through. Everything was executed perfectly. The service was wonderful and I had a very knowledgeable server. I opted for the four course prefix for $70. I felt like I was stealing from the place it was such a good value. I also did the $40 additional wine pairing with prior request for a big red which the amazing server took great caution of and served only the greatest wines.  Honestly this was one of the best value meals I've ever had in my life. Four courses plus full pour wines for under $120 is just unheard of especially at this amplitude of food. Good for you Brandon levine! You really know how to bring it!! And to all the servers there, you're very knowledgeable and wonderful!! Good job SEL, you're amazing and you've got a great team! I hope Scottsdale keeps you going!"}
{"text":"Our group of four enjoyed two courses each, a la carte, and the waiter was kind enough to bring side plates so we could share.  The filet mignon was exceptional, and the duck and gnocchi were delicious too.  The butternut squash soup and seasonal salad were very good.  I would have expected a bit more to the salad, though the ingredients were thought out and nicely arranged on the plate. Won't go into detail as the menu changes weekly.  Bear in mind there are no freezers at this establishment, just refrigerators, so the food is as fresh as it gets.  I really enjoyed the strawberry shortcake; do not expect angel food cake.  The cake is much grainier and dense. Delicious!  Nice wine list and super gracious service."}
{"text":"Easily the best desert I've ever had. Eat here ASAP. From the service to the drinks, this place is five stars all day long. Well done Sel.. We will not forget this Mother's Day anytime soon."}
{"text":"Vegetarian tasting menus that are cheaper than the regular tasting menu always pique my interest. I've been burned by tasting menus in the past (see my Binkley's review), but after seeing a glowing write up about Sel in the local paper, I decided we should check it out.  The interior is a little too uber white and tries to hard to look like a fancy Scottsdale club. It just doesn't convey fine dining to me.   The first course came out amazingly fast; it felt like 5 minutes after we placed our order. Unfortunately, my appetizer was cold. Our soups came out next, and then there was a LONG delay before our salad come out next. At least 45 minutes had passed. Not surprisingly, the kitchen had messed up my order and used the regular caesar dressing which contains fish instead of using the veggie version. That's what happens when you try to make a dish veggie by swapping out an item or omitting it. The preferable alternative is creating a vegetarian item that can stand out on its own. My salad was disappointing since it didn't have the \"amazing\" bacon (according to my husband), but my entree of risotto was outstanding. My husband thought the truffle and mushroom taste was a little overwhelming, but I loved it.   I wish I had room for their famed dessert, but I couldn't eat another bite. I wish I hadn't wasted the stomach room on a lackluster soup and salad. If I had to do it over again, I would get the appetizer, risotto and dessert a la carte."}
{"text":"Incredible food and dinning experience. Loved the 4 course meal options. Everything had outstanding flavor and taste. Hidden gem in Old Town!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for a nice night out! We had the four course prix fixe. It's a pricier restaurant but the prix fixe is a great deal, and well worth the cost. Every dish was delicious. The pork belly was some of the most tender I have ever had. The specialty cocktail menu had some good and interesting drinks. Our server provided great guidance with the cocktails. Speaking of service, it was fantastic! Our server, Theresa, was amazing and put up with our goofy table so well. It was the type of service that makes a dining experience more special. Definitely recommend this spot and would easily return."}
{"text":"The food was good, but not perfect and a couple of not so good items.  The service is below average and is and was a real disappointment.  We felt unwelcome and rushed.   The service would be ok at a low end restaurant, at this price point and expectation level it falls way short!  Not worth the $."}
{"text":"This place was spot on. The hostess was sweet, the waiter was a charmer, the bartender was funny, the wife of the chef was a jewel. The food was OMG... perfect bites. I shared with the bestie and ugh I was tempted to be jealous occasionally, but just wasn't disappointed. Garlic Soup was amazing esp with the lil mandarin or tangerine oil (it was love in a bowl) .There was this burrata jewel salad yumminess... Then there was the delicate creamy smokey squash blossom taco and langostine ceviche was just refreshing, there were perfectly seared scallops and light pillowy Gnocchi and goat milk Ricotta lasagne, and sigh why have I just found you. Dear Sel, you can do no wrong in my world... except you aren't open for breakfast lunch and dinner 24/7... we will be back. I am such a fangirl now."}
{"text":"Everything is excellent. Great ingredients, unique menu and always changing. Refined and quite tasty but not too pretentious.  This is a great place for a special occasion, the food more than makes up for the location (which isn't bad by any means, but it's not on a mountain overlooking the valley :-)) ."}
{"text":"Great meal. Great service. I was noticing previous reviews panned the service, but my experience was perfect. I was not constantly being bothered, but the server was there when needed. The real highlight of the meal was the pork belly with a corn Benet (sp). When pierced with a fork the Benet oozed over the pork belly like a poached egg. Incredible. The best dish of the night."}
{"text":"This isn't a place you will go to overnight but on a special occasion or when you have a LOT of time to dine then I'll suggest this. Sel is a course meal so you'll most likely be there for about 2 1/2 hours. The food though is amazing. Really intense flavors, and small dishes. The course is about 70$ but the separation and timing of the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"This was the best meal I've had in a while. I was in town visiting from LA, and I'm definitely coming back next time I'm in Scottsdale/Phoenix.  $80 tasting menu (4 courses) seems like a good deal to me! I went with the hamachi (delicious), cauliflower-miso soup (couldn't really taste any miso but was still amazing), beet and Brussels salad (really yummy), and the steak (cooked to perfection and great quality meat - pic included)! Another person in my party got the quail instead of the soup and that also looked great.  The staff was all very knowledgeable and friendly, and the owner came around to check in on each table which is a nice touch. One recommendation would be to call to make sure you'll be seated inside if the weather isn't perfect. We were able to sit inside but I saw some very chilly looking people outside, and I imagine that would ruin the overall experience."}
{"text":"Wow! What an unexpected surprise this delicious restaurant was! Really unique dishes to excite any foodie looking for something special. The Som, Mike was awesome and suggested a fantastic wine. A true delight overall for just stumbling upon this little gem last night."}
{"text":"Ok just dropped in while walking around what a great place only had time for a superb cocktails for our group.  Meanie looks wonderful very interesting option for fix price for menu from the chef.    Will be back so glad we discovered such a pleasant place to enjoy fiends & cocktails."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try the much anticipated meal at Sel and it surely did not disappoint!  We enjoyed the 4 course prix fixe menu which included a crispy jerusalem artichoke with corn on the cob, butternut squash soup, beet, tomato and mozzarella salad, and maple leaf duck with rapini...my mouth is watering reliving this moment through writing my review.  Nice atmopshere, great service and high quality food.  I highly recommend starting your experience with a barbara jean cocktail up...so tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Pricey but well worth it.  May is just wonderful, she is the door girl but also the owners/chefs wife.  Cant go wrong with anything you get.  Make sure to add the wine paring and foie gras."}
{"text":"We visit Arizona frequently and were strolling through Old Town and noticed this restaurant which looked interesting.  We checked the Yelp reviews which were excellent and made a reservation.  From start to finish our experience was first class. The restaurant is owned and operated by the chef and his wife.The chef is hands on cooking, not a souse chef. We talked to the chef for awhile and he is very creative and energetic about his food and wines.  Our waiter, Richie, is also a sommelier. He picked our wines and did an excellent job. He was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the foods. They have a wine pairing available to go with their $80 fixed price menu. Both are well worth it.  Having had the opportunity to eat fine dining all over the world, I can honestly say this meal went toe to toe with some of the best meals I have had. We chose to sit outside on a beautiful evening, but the indoor decor was very well done.  I can not say enough about how good all of the courses were. Each was an exquisite explosion of tastes. The menu changes every month, so its not worth going into all of the fine dishes since the menu changes next week.  For those that are worried about not being full, put those fears to rest. There really was more food than we could eat.  If you eat out one night in Scottsdale for fine dining, I recommend you put this gem of a restaurant at the top of your list."}
{"text":"Very unique experience! Overall fantastic. Limited choices but that suits me fine because everything was delicious and I'd rather have a few choices that are all amazing instead of 100 that are, meh.  Standouts were definitely the crispy octopus and the strawberry dessert. Omgosh that dessert will live in my dreams.  Wonderful spot!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best meal I've had. The ingredients are fresh and the flavors are spot-on. The menu changes regularly to provide innovative dishes. I recommend the tasting menu which gives the opportunity to taste multiple dishes from this talented chef. The corn custard squash blossom dish was the single best mouthful of food I've had in my life. Absolutely amazing food. The service was stellar and location can't be beat. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, lovely atmosphere and excellent staff especially the sommelier Mike! We went for our anniversary dinner and it was a fantastic experience+"}
{"text":"I've seen the other reviews and have to agree the the tastes are amazing.  The wait staff seem to try hard and be engaged but last night for my daughters birthday the biggest issue was wait times between the multi course menu.  I don't think it's unreasonable to think that waiting 20-30 minutes between plates is high.  For that reason I'd have to rate as I have.  That alone would not make me want to return."}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly life-changing.  The prix-fixe four course meal is outstanding with every course better than the last. We had hamachi carpaccio, followed by the most spectacular quail \"coq au vin\", then pork belly \"taco\" wrapped in a soft Chinese pork bun shell and finally divine and beautifully spiced venison, as well as sea bass on a carrot polenta---YUMmmmm! The chocolate tiramisu was a fitting end to this five star meal. The staff are so warm and attentive, particularly our server Richie. The wine and cocktail menu are also superb--and the meal can be paired with wines.  Kudos to Chef Branden Levine whose creativity and culinary talent shine and made this night so memorable for us. I don't know how he does it and keeps offering a new menu every three weeks!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Everything was so great. From drinks to food to service! Must try this place. Any foodie heaven. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and perfectly prepared food! A gem in the Arts district!"}
{"text":"the dinner was 130.00 each and didn't include desert I thought since it was a whole valentines dinner it would be included  I was shocked not worth 350.00 I was hungry when i got home"}
{"text":"We were actually looking to go to Cafe Monarch that evening, but there was no availability so I thought we'd try this place out.   The decor appealed, as did the quiet looking location down the street from one of our favorite bars (The Beverly).  Despite the fact the menu changes frequently, they had the tasting menu posted online, and it struck all the right chords with my wife and I.  The setting was beautiful, and the waitstaff was extremely knowledgeable and attentive.  The criticism about noise in this place seems a little undue, I thought it was fine and vibrant, not overwhelming.  Now, on to the food: amazing!  They clearly care about the ingredients, the details, and executed everything perfectly.  The wine pairings were spot on (and generously poured!), and this ranks in the top 3 meals I've had in the valley.  Was it pricey?  Yes, but worth it.  Great for a splurge or significant night out, and the chef and staff clearly care."}
{"text":"Looked forward to trying this place for a friends bday who was in town from LA. There was nothing amazing about this place other than the amount of money we spent for the service. Our waiter was AWFUL. When you are spending hundreds of dollars for 4 people, get it together folks."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner on August 19. Food was excellent , very well prepared and beautifully presented . Staff were very professional and polite , our waiter Dave was wonderful . We will definitely go back and I will recommend this restaurant to all my friends . Rightfully deserves the five stars .Thanks for an enjoyable meal and evening ."}
{"text":"I never even knew a restaurant like Sel existed until last night! The restaurant was absolutely beautiful. The service was top notch and the food was just simply put, amazing. We indulged in two bottles of champagne - a beer each and ordered the 4 course meal! This restaurant is a gem and can not wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Great fine dining.  I always have a problem taking my friend out to dinner because she's a pescatarian (vegetarian, but eats seafood).  I see her only once a year, so I try to find a really nice place.  This place is it.  I recommend the prix fixe menu.  It consist of 4 courses.  The first 3 courses are small, but the main course is a nice portion.  Dessert is not part of the prix fixe menu.  The menu changes as the seasons change. This time I had the Stuffed Squash Blossom.  The flavor just erupted in my mouth wishing I had more to eat.  The Cantaloupe soup was okay, but it didn't make me lust for every drop. The Pork Secreto was making my taste buds wish for more.  The man course was the Seared Scallops which were perfectly cooked.  They were moist and tender and the highlight of the meal.  My friend had almost the same dishes except for the Port Secreto where she substituted a vegetarian dish.  Her comments were similar to my comments, but she really loved the wine selection.  They had a small, but wide variety of wines.  They ranged from inexpensive to pricey.  We ordered 2 bottles of wine.  One bottle was from well know French winery, but the other bottle was a Malbec from Argentina which was affordable and very good. We normally go to different restaurants every year, but I wouldn't mind going back to this place again."}
{"text":"It's about time that I say something about this Masterpiece. This restaurant has the most creative and tastiest food in Phoenix/Scottsdale.                     We have eaten here many times.Always almost perfect. 4 courses-all great.Service is non- intrusive and everyone is welcoming.They really care and want you to have a great experience.    Another great meal at Sel. Everything was perfect. It's a special occasion place that would be considered tops in NY LA or SF. It's that good!!!"}
{"text":"We dined at Sel for our anniversary the other day. While it wasn't cheap the food at Sel is exceptional. We order the 4 course tasting menu with wine paring, and every dish was packed with inventive flavors.   Honestly hats off to the chef. I am constantly let down by high end restaurants with overpriced food. The chef visited our table after our meal and let us know the small menu changes frequently. We are excited to visit again."}
{"text":"FINALLY tried Sel. I had some friends visiting from Denver this past weekend and was trusted with picking the Saturday night spot for dinner. We were early for our reservation so we sat at the bar for a drink. This place is pretty small but the decor is incredible. It was modern and sexy, bright white walls and bar top offset with a purple fuzzy back wall. It truly was beautiful to look at. I learned that Sel translates to \"salt\" in English after thinking to myself \"are those really mini salt shakers sticking out of the tile wall in the restroom?\" The level of detail in the decor transcended to the food preparation and presentation as well.   The Four course Prix Fixe menu was fabulous and interesting. Between the four of us we had:  First Course:: Wild Mushroom Ragu \"Crouton\" and Blue Point Oysters.  :: The goat cheese mousse and truffle lemon emulsion were harmonious and added a great tang to the mushroom Ragu.   Second Course:: Rabbit Confit Ravioli and Red King Crab :: The king crab was my favorite of the two, composed partly of wasabi caviar and foie gras sauce you cannot go wrong   Third Course:: Winter greens  :: Bacon and candy stripe beets, need I say more?  Fourth Course:: Crispy Skin Wild Striped Bass, Hemp Seed Crusted Scallops, Lone Mountain Wagyu Hanger Steak, and Grilled Octopus :: The squid ink risotto and sweet chili chimichurri took the octopus dish to the next level. It was absolutely perfect! The waygu was cooked to a perfect medium rare with the blood orange hollandaise and banyuls beef stock reduction complimenting the flavor of the meat. My friends said their bass and scallops were very good as well.  Supplement:: Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras :: Melt in your mouth good! Just how it should be  This was not a cheap meal, but it was a celebration with friends and we found it to be worth every penny."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant with lots of potential.  They serve very good food in a nice ambiance. I liked they used fresh flowers everywhere. It has a lot of upscale feeling to it, good place to come for good food.  They serve prix fixe 4 course meals for about $70. Recently added option for wine pairing for $40. All the food served had a nice taste and I enjoyed all the dishes served. I thought about describing each meal but the menu changes weekly.   Ingredients are carefully picked by the chef and I especially enjoyed figs in salad, and ferns used for side of scallops. Unfortunately, when the server server said 15-year aged balsamic vinegar on the side of the strawberry shortcake, I licked a sauce a bit with excitement with my finger but it didn't have the texture and taste of what I know of 15-year aged balsamic vinegar.   When I left for bathroom, I saw my coffee ready, but when I came out, it was still there. I would have enjoyed freshly made hot coffee but the server let it sit for a while. For his credit, he decided not to charge for coffee.   Wine pairing - I had to look at him twice and he asked if we wanted fresh glass each time. Some were good but others were not that good. I couldn't tell that buttery chardonnay he described. Perhaps I don't drink enough white wine to know that.  In a way, wine pairing was good that it was only $40 per person, and small amount of wine is served for each meal.   Food was great, server was friendly.  I enjoyed the food but next time, I think I would just order a bottle of wine, and not go for wine pairing."}
{"text":"great food, for a getaway! customer services were great and they were busy and they were so helpful and nice they were able to get my order done fast"}
{"text":"The food and service were amazing! I had the halibut and my husband salivated over the duck. The chef came out at the end of the meal to see that we enjoyed it. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Wow! What a wonderful dining experience! From start to finish, a fantastic meal! Loved my vodka cocktail creation. Refreshing and balanced. We did the 4 course prix fixe and you should too. Especially if you want a starter and an entree. Doesn't make $ sense not to.  I'm afraid this review will suck, frankly, because the dishes were so fancy and there's no way I can remember ingredients. All I can go off of is taste and everything is phenomenal! The Jerusalem artichoke was delicious! I had never had one and the mini corn cob was topped with some sort of crunchy salty goodness. Again, no clue what is was, I suck. The summer salad was good, flavorful tomatoes, a lovely soft cheese and beets.   The butternut squash soup is the best butternut squash soup that I have ever had. I'm not a bss expert but this was next level. I wish I had more but probably would have made myself sick overdoing it.  The dorade was very good, skin crispy and yummy. Loved the cippolini onions that the fish was served on top of. Would love to figure out how to make those at home. Desserts were very good as well.  It's a small space, I don't know if you could eat there on a weekend night without a reservation? Small bar. Cool, clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Beat of the best !!!!  Best Duck I ever had and amazing service. The chef is so talented. Puts Scottsdale on the map for great culinary start ups !"}
{"text":"Knowledgeable, attentive service and delicious!   Bradley was our server and he couldn't have been more delightful! Food was prepared perfectly!  Nice intimate environment!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here during Presidents' Day weekend, and they were quite busy. I had heard the food was good though I tempered my expectations since I wasn't really sure how good Scottsdale restaurants could be. Boy, were my socks blown off!  I was planning to order a la carte but was told the portions were on the smaller side. The individual prices were also going to add up to much higher than the prix fixe so I opted for the latter.  I ordered the king crab, zucchini lasagna, king salmon, and scallops. Each and every dish was so tasty and delicious and had that \"unami\" taste going. All of the flavors just complemented each other, and I could not get enough.  Service was very friendly and attentive, and the location in downtown can't be beat.   Definitely one of the best, if not the best, restaurants in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"There just aren't enough stars for Sel.  It's rare to find a restaurant that impresses you the moment you walk in but this happened at Sel.  The decor is beautiful,white and blue,sparking glasses on the tables.  The prix fix menu makes it simple and is so worthwhile.  We elected to have the four course meal with the wine pairings.  Every course was perfect in every way and presented perfectly.  Dave was our waiter and he was terrific.  Chef Brandon you are a class act and your attention to detail is nothing short of amazing.  Congrats to you and your staff for making our night memorable in Scottsdale.     This restaurant is not to be missed,make a reservation and plan to have a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this!  Exceptional Food and Wine List to match!  A splurge but worth it"}
{"text":"First time and blew me away.  After 30 years in LA and SF eating in every 5 star restaurant in both cities, this stands up to them all.  Excellent service, very inviting space and killer food.  Worth every dollar, not inexpensive but fair for the quality.  DO NOT miss dining at this newcomer.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The best food I've had in so long.  Every dish was beyond delicious.  I couldn't believe that one after another the food was so divine.  I'm grateful for the talents of chef Levine!  Thank you for bringing your talents to the world.  The food and experience is top notch.  You definitely get your moneys worth!"}
{"text":"Came here for my husband's birthday, had the caramelized beet polenta and braised pork belly for my 1st and 2nd course and these were both very good. the compressed melon salad for 3rd course which was phenomenal just packed with flavor. the duck breast for my 4th course which was very good and the foie gras which was absolutely delicious. my husband had the filet mignon and said it was the best steak he's ever had. we topped of dinner with tiramisu and strawberry shortcake  for dessert and that was just melt in your mouth delicious. the atmosphere was decent, small cozy restaurant. I'd say they could turn up some music a tad louder, it was a little too quiet for me and I feel like the whole room could listen to our conversation. the waiters were pleasant and nice but all seemed timid and a kind of awkwardly reciting the menu from a script by memory the best they could..a couple of the waiters had stains on their pants which was a little tacky for high end restaurant  and I did find a hair in my duck breast which I quickly just picked out and kept eating cause hey the food was good but I can see how some people might be bothered by that. Overall I give 4 stars for great food and friendly service and I would recommend this place to others to try."}
{"text":"Some of the best ahi poke I've ever had. The corn chowder was amazing. Service was excellent, very modern sleek vibe, reasonably priced with a 4 course prix fixed menu at $70, and the chef even came out to greet us. Make sure to ask for extra caramels with the check. They will blow your mind"}
{"text":"We came for our anniversary and had a wonderful time. The restaurant is fairly small, and has really neat decor. We did the 4-course menu, and everything we had was delicious. There was a nice progression of the courses leading up to the last course. The compressed peach salad was so light and refreshing and perfect right before the fourth course. I had the filet and my wife had the duck. The filet was so tender and melted in my mouth. My favorite part of the dish however was the morel mushrooms - they were so flavorful and I wish I had more on my plate! My wife had the duck, and absolutely loved it! Presentation was really beautiful, and we really enjoyed the waiter describing each dish when it was served.   After the four courses were so full and didn't think we'd order desert, but for our anniversary they gave us complementary dessert. We chose the strawberry marzipan shortcake, no surprise, it was amazing.  Overall, the food was fantastic and it was a perfect atmosphere and experience for celebrating our anniversary!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Found this place on Yelp during a work trip and so glad we came!! The chef Brandon Levine came out to greet us afterwards and it was nice. I'm with a Group of foodies and are all so happy!! The food was delicious!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came to Sel to celebrate our anniversary, and had an absolutely flawless experience!!  If you enjoy fine dining then you will absolutely love Sel.  They provide you a 4-course menu that you can add onto if you'd like.  We decided to try one of everything (if there were 2 options) for the first 3 courses, then had the duck and the halibut for the main courses.  Every singe dish was impeccable - the flavors were outstanding, and the presentation was gorgeous.  I felt bad digging in and ruining the artistry of each dish (although not that bad, since it was delicious and needed to be eaten, lol).  The service here was also above and beyond.  The hostess greeted us and wished us a happy anniversary.  The waiter gave us thorough descriptions of all the dishes, and even sent out the bartender and sommelier without us needing to request them for some drink questions we were mulling over.  They even noticed when a gentleman starting playing his acoustic guitar outside of the restaurant, and turned off the music on the patio so it would't compete with the other music.  Having that wherewithal truly made the experience even more pleasant.  We will 100% be coming back here for another special occasion.  Thank you Sel for making our anniversary even more special! :)"}
{"text":"Very impressive.  Had a great dinner with exceptional flavors, traditional dishes were flawlessly executed with a slight level of adventure; enough solidly delivered basics to really anchor the meal but creativity to really notch up the experience.  We loved the meal, girlfriend said \"this may have been the best meal I ever had\".  Waiter was casual but attentive and hit all the marks.  Overall a great experience.    Only downside was I checked in on Yelp but didn't get a free order of mozzarella sticks."}
{"text":"12th anniversary dinner  Outstanding service, food, wine, desert Intimate, unique, personable atmosphere which accommodates and provides for your desires and interests!  If you enjoy the best of the best In your life you will enjoy Sel!"}
{"text":"I think this is one of the three best meals we've had in Phoenix, and we've lived here 13 years. We went for our anniversary and had the 4-course prix fixe; I opted for the vegetarian options and my husband had the meat versions. We agreed it was all delicious, innovative, and beautifully presented. My favorite was the stuffed squash blossom first course. Or maybe the third course, compressed peach salad with goat cheese. How to pick?! They brought out a marzipan/strawberry/salted caramel concoction at the end that was to die for. $70 per person ($60 vegetarian 4-course option). We will go back."}
{"text":"What a PHENOMENAL place to eat! My boyfriend took me here for my birthday, and what a special place to celebrate! Considering we both love going out to eat and I am a total foodie myself, this blew our minds. Everything from the decor, service, staff, cocktails, and food were above and beyond exceptional. Our server was Bradley, and he can answer ANYTHING you could think of asking. The bartender, but really mixologist is more appropriate here, really knows his stuff. We started with a bottle of Spanish white wine, which we love and was very reasonably priced considering restaurant markups. We decided the best way to go is the Prix Fixe menu, 4 courses for $60 a person. So glad we did this option, as it gives you a taste of more than half the menu if you share your plate with another person! We also 'subbed' the Filet for the Kobe ribeye for only half the cost of the ribeye and that was the best decision of the night! They are one of the few restaurants in the country that have the true certification, not the 'American waygu' that is quite frankly a sham. What people say about it being so buttery from the rendered fat were not kidding, it was PERFECT, I might never eat another steak again! (Kidding, of course!) I am not a huge mushroom person, and the Roasted Chanterelle Ragout was delicious, however a bit heart for being the first course. I cannot believe a restaurant put out mushrooms that I ate up like hotcakes. In the same vein, the Greek salad had a twist with candied olives (and I hate olives), but they were scrumptious! But the real star was the Kobe, that came with the accompaniments of the Filet, including Pecorino-White Truffle Gnocchi. I grew up with gnocchi, and these were the fluffiest, lightest, most flavorful ones to date. We could have sworn we were eating clouds. Then the restaurant surprised us with a comped birthday dessert! As a former baker, I am a bit snobby about it, but we were floored by the complexity and nuances of the tiramasu.  All in all, VISIT! It is expensive, but worth every second. This is not the place to skip out on something because of the price. Sel is a special place for special food and cocktails, and that is always worth it."}
{"text":"Had a lovely girl's night out at Sel. The interior is modern with a white theme to echo the restaurant's name which is \"salt\" in French. The menu changes every few weeks (I think every 2 weeks the server said), so eating here will typically be a new experience each time you go.  They offer a 4 course prix fixe meal for $70 as well as a la carte items. If you go with the prix fixe you will have a choice of your appetizer and main entree while the soup and salad will be only one choice. I went with the prix fixe, choosing the lobster stuffed squash blossom and halibut with green curry cassoulet. The soup was a yellow tomato gazpacho and the salad was a gravlax vinaigrette salad with mixed greens.  Each course was thoughtfully prepared, with a beautiful presentation. Seasoning was perfect, and the combination of textures and flavors of each dish was excellent. My favorite of the prix fixe menu was the lobster stuffed squash blossom. The delicate taste of the squash blossom went well with the lobster meat, and the breaded crispy outer layer of the blossom was perfect. I also have to say this is the best gazpacho I've had by far. It was a smooth, refreshing cold soup and the sweet peach gratinee in the center provided a great contrast with the more acidic taste of the tomatoes. The main entree was lovely, with a tender, perfectly cooked halibut and exotic tasting \"cassoulet\" with the addition of green curry.  Service was excellent. Plates were taken away and water was refilled as needed. Our server was friendly and warm.   Even the water here is quite delicious, as it is steeped with cucumber and mint. I'll have to try this at home!  Dessert was a heavenly strawberry shortcake made with marizpan, a quenelle of vanilla bean gelato, caramel drizzle and balsamic vinegar.   The four course meal was just right for me. I'm glad I shared the dessert because I don't think I'd be able to finish the whole thing if I hadn't.  The only thing that bothered me was when the filet mignon dishes came out for the people at our table, each piece was differently sized. My friend sitting across from me got a significantly smaller piece of filet compared to her neighbor. If we are paying $70 for our meal you bet each dish needs to be consistent and have the same amount of food.  Overall 4.5/5."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience! Food had flavor out of this world! Service was phenomenal. Great ambience."}
{"text":"We visited two weeks ago. Amazing!  This restaurant has a fixed menu and while that normally might feel limiting, I believe there's something for everyone (we dined with friends who are sometimes fussy). So check out the menu. We did the wine pairings.   Service was very attentive. They told us they were short some help in the kitchen and made sure the wine pours kept us happy!  This is perhaps one of the best restaurants in the Phoenix metro area. (Of course, not surprising as the chef is the former chef from Monarch Cafe)."}
{"text":"After all the rave reviews of this restaurant we were very disappointed last night. First of all the restaurant is beautiful inside but small and therefore extremely noisy especially if there is a larger group inside. Last night there was a large group and a group of four drunk  people all of which were Extremely Loud. This is not the fault of the restaurant the loud patrons I mean , however the Acoustics are terrible. We chose to eat outdoors and I have to say I am comparing this to Monarch Café and there's no comparison. Where as Monarch has a magnificent beautifully lit Courtyard this place has plastic chairs sitting adjacent to Main Street. They have done absolutely nothing to decorate.   You are having a very expensive meal and the outdoor Ambiance is something like a fast food place.  The meal was not spectacular, again I am comparing it to Cafe Monarch. Because they are the same type of restaurant with a limited menu and in fact the chef used to cook at Monarch. The food was nowhere near as interesting. The service was good but nowhere near as excellent as monarch. And it took forever to dine there almost 3 hours. The time between courses was OK until the end and then we must have waited 45 minutes for our main course. The waiter offered to buy us a glass of wine that was nice of him however if I drink too much before I eat I don't care if I eat any more and that pretty much was the case last night.  Now this is another Personal Taste here and I didn't hold it against the restaurant but I didn't care for the location. Watching drunken people especially drunken women in Sky High shoes staggering about  unable to walk in their shoes even sober let alone inebriated  coming up and down Main Street was not particularly my idea of great Entertainment."}
{"text":"Wow. We are foodies and this place is deliciously amazing. We did the price fixe menu...maple infused crispy bacon on the salad, subtle layers of flavor in the form and bisque, squash w mint frittata was great, glazed sauteed scallops on bed of tiny lentils and cirn yumminess. My sweetie's smooth texture of filet was amazing. We go to a lot of restaurants but this was eye opening. I already texted a friend that would love this place.  The interiors are chic and fresh and it's not too loud...what a concept! (They said Esther Boivin Interiors...)"}
{"text":"AMAZING! I think I have a high bar for high-end food being from San Francisco, but this was incredible. Loved the squash blossom relleno and the bisque, but it was all excellent. Sat at the bar. Very cool ambience there and you can see into the kitchen. Small - intimate and hip. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Second time here now and again top five meals of my life!!! I never review but felt the need.....have been to many well reviewed and noted restaurants (Gary da jo, nobu lanai, gramercy tavern, etc) and hands down one of the best meals of my life. All courses were amazing - the flavors, the atmosphere, the service. I hope Branden gets the recognition he deserves!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how to feel about this place?  We came with a large group for dinner. Our server was prompt and very nice. The ambiance outside would've been great - had it not been for the uncomfortable plastic lawn chairs they provide. Everyone had to keep getting up because of how uncomfortable the chairs were.  Food wise, the shrimp ceviche & tartare was great, the pork shoulder was AWESOME (I don't even like pork), but my entree fell short. The duck breast was served with some weird pudding-esque sauce that no one in my party enjoyed. I feel like they really fell short on the duck and ambiance."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Sel last night for date night. We did the dinner menu with the wine pairing and it was amazing! Mike the bartender/server was awesome! He gave us the best recommendations on what to order and paired the best wine to go with. We had the Crispy Cauliflower Polenta, Roasted Romanesco Soup, Sel Ceasar (no bacon), Seared Maple Leaf Farm Duck Breast, and Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras. To end the feast we had Strawberry Marzipan Shortcake for dessert. The best I ever had. Everything was wonderful! The staff was very nice and friendly. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"This could easily have been a 5 star review, but the kitchen was backed up this particular night.  We would absolutely return -- the food is simply amazing and the ambience/décor is a fun, chic vibe.  Service was excellent, just the restaurant was super busy and the four course menu took nearly 3 hours with some large waits between courses.    They change the menu every 2 weeks which keeps it fresh and exciting.  We had  an amazing oxtail appetizer followed by the most wonderful coconut milk based squash soup.  The duck entrée was superb.    To their credit, they also acknowledged the slow kitchen and offered us free dessert.  The chef also made a point to visit all the tables at the end of the evening.  Just 5 months old, Sel is still working out some kinks but is already a really special restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice to see a new upscale restaurant in this area.  The decor and ambiance is sleek and modern.  (The open and bright industrial kitchen is a bit of a distraction however).   The food was excellent with the exception of the spring roll appetizer.  Although the wait staff was pleasant, we felt they were lacking somewhat in their professionalism as well as in their knowledge of the food and wine.  At times the staff busied themselves cleaning glasses instead of attending to the small details (refilling wine etc).  We are hoping it was just an off night and will give it another try in a couple months since they have only been open four weeks."}
{"text":"Sel is located in old down town. We sat outside on the patio looking at the street. It was a quiet street with galleries and good for people watching.   Richie was our waiter. He was attentive and very friendly. We ordered the pre fixe four course dinner. We both had King Crab soup, crispy Helena Pork Belly, Meyer lemon king salmon and the Miso Chilean Sea Bass.  Every course had great flavors and beautiful presentation. My favorite was the pork belly with the corn beignet.   Richie brought us strawberry short cake to celebrate our birthdays.   It was a great evening and delicious meal."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! Our food, every course, was incredible (especially the strawberry shortcake). The drinks were excellent, and the service was impeccable. It has been a long time since we have been somewhere that exceeded our expectations in every possible way. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful presentation and delicious   I will return very soon.    Squash Blossom, Ahi Tuna, Filet M."}
{"text":"We just wandered in for a drink to the cozy bar.  Richie recommended the venison carpaccio appetizer  with our vodka cocktail. It was amazing. We immediately made reservations for dinner next week. Small, personal as well as warm and inviting. Review for dinner to follow next week."}
{"text":"amazing food, amazing service, the wine pairings and the cocktails were also great! it's a small, cozy, romantic restaurant with modern decor. Adding this one to my faves list!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had! My husband and I came here for our anniversary and he was so happy I picked this place for our special night. Marlen was the BEST server and recommended some delicious drinks to pair with our dinner.  If you're looking for a well prepared meal with exotic choices, Sel will fill your tummy with the ultimate happiness!"}
{"text":"Not great service. Mediocre drinks. We waited forever to even get ONE drink. What is this place thinking? You go to Old Town, to a nice restaurant and expect top notch. Well, we were wrong. Maybe these people haven't experienced, or worked in a nice restaurant. But holy god were we disappointed. In fact we were embarrassed to have taken our friends here. Hopefully they turn things around."}
{"text":"What an amazing meal from start to finish!  I love Hillstone and Flemmings and Steak 44, but this restaurant blows those away in terms of fanciness, chefiness, and yes, price.  Our dinner for two without wine was around $200. So, maybe not an every week option, but for something special, it was definitely worth it.  The dinners are prix fixe. Some of the highlights  were the Romanesco soup which was soft, velvety, and like nothing I've ever had before. Next course was the Cesar salad, made with  brussle sprouts frites and applewood bacon crisps-- probably the best salad ever anywhere.  Dinner and dessert were also amazing. One high point was that my mom has food allergies  and \"food preferences\" and they were more than willing to accommodate her requests.   We had a wonderful and memorable meal and despite the price, we both agreed it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, fantastic food! The tasting menu is fun!  Very interesting flavors. Not cheap but worth it for a special meal!"}
{"text":"Took my out of town foodie friend here and we weren't disappointed.  The food was amazing. Rather than opting for the sampling menu we did the a la carte option with each of us trying different items.  The octopus ceviche was amazing. The corn panne cotta was good but the pork belly was divine.  The scallops we very slightly over cooked but delicious.  The duck breast and potatoes was amazing.  I was disappointed that they were out of the halibut but the Chilean sea bass was a decent replacement. I'm in love with the horseradish cauliflower. To finish the night we had a strawberry shortcake that just melted in your mouth.  The waiter was so personable and great.  The only down side to the meal was not in anyone's control and the credit card system was down and it took them an hour to figure out a replacement.  While they didn't offer anything while waiting when asked they did provide a complimentary glass of while for us for the wait.  Overall this was an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"I really have been wanting to try Sel for quite some time. I've heard mixed reviews on it so it was great to finally get my own experience. Walking in on a Friday at 7pm I was expecting it to be lively, filled tables etc. but it was the opposite it almost didn't look open. I was kind of bummed because liveliness definitely creates a fun atmosphere. Our sever was charming, knowledgeable of the menu and attentive. I was kind of annoyed that the second we had finished or even seemed to finish a dish the bus boys IMMEDIATELY ran to the table to clear the plates. At one point we even had to tell them we were NOT finished. However, every single thing that was put in front of me was PHENOMENAL! started with the Foie Gras, Polenta Frits, quail coq au vin, pork belly taco and finished with the lasagna! It was all incredible! The presentation, flavors and ingredients everything tasted fresh and wonderful!!!  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the distinct pleasure of dining at this restaurant for Mother's Day.  The 4 course menu was stupendous.  The mint pea purée squash appetizer was by far the best ap I have ever had.  The corn chowder soup was so complex and delicious as well. My husband enjoyed the scallops and I had the vegetarian option of Sherpa milk ravioli.  We were stuffed and I almost said no to desert. What a mistake that would have been.  The strawberry shortcake caramel desert was AMAZING!  The sea salt in the caramel exploded in my mouth.  Best dinner I have ever had!"}
{"text":"For New American, creative and inspired dishes - this restaurant is a MUST. Every course was something to talk about with unexpected flavors and interesting pairings of equally important \"main event\" and garnish. The first course of Langoustine Tartar offered maybe the best bites I've ever had in my life. And the desserts were phenomenal. Everything at this little gem of a restaurant was super killer. Really a must eat at restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow. Where should I start!!! This is a true foodie experience and I am glad that my hubby has followed Chef Brendan since he first saw him in a few Food Network shows. There where so many great dishes throughout the course and none of them fell fat. My favorites: Foie Gras, Rabbit Confit, and Scallops with Squid Ink Gnocchi. WOW WOW WOW. Everything that came out was so full of flavor and had the freshest ingredients. WE will be coming back to try different dishes.  We understand that the 4 course meals can be very pricey, but with the menu changing a few times a month, it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Like a couple other reviews, my wife and I agree that in that price point, one expects less shortcomings; it is NYE, we had reserved for 6pm. I called at 2:30pm wanting to reach the sommelier; the sweet  young lady said the sommelier would call me back in one hour....I waited 'till 4pm then called again. My message had not been conveyed. I asked the sommelier, who happens to be the bartender, to chill a bottle of rose Champagne because we like it very, very cold and have it set on our table prior to us arrival. Very nice gentleman, he indeed obliged except the Champagne was not on the table as we were seated at 6:05. Again, in a lesser priced restaurant that would not be worth mentioning. When we arrived at Sel we were greeted by a couple cute \"high schoolish\" girls, sweet and polite but absolutely NOT professional. We were then led to our table by another very young inexperienced lady who had NOT gotten our request to be seated inside and not on the patio. Once at our table (inside!), the first thing noticeable is the bistro-like paper covering the linen table cloth, very annoying, each time you lift your arm from the table, the paper comes along.....at $130 menu...? Our bottle of Champagne finally arrived and I was expecting the sommelier to do the honors....no luck, remember, he tends the bar; it turns out his girl friend, hired for the evening, opened the bottle with great pains to the point that I volunteered to help. Typical of inexperienced servers, she overpowered our first glass of Champagne. Our waiter, Jeff, was very upbeat and ready to please; he seemed to know the menu quite well and his (?) timing for food and Champagne service was perfect. To our surprise, again, in the context of a wanna-be-classy restaurant, only one \"amuse bouche\" out of the 2 listed was available?...at the very first seating? on NYE? with only 6 tables occupied?...then he told us that the caviar, also listed in the entrees of that special NYE dinner, was not available.....? not that either of us would have ordered caviar, but still....!  ...the 5 course dinner was flawless, besides the dish of chanterelles that turned out to be dried and reconstituted out-of-season morels (the waiter was not aware!). Very small portions at first with the main course as a full portion....perfect amount of food as it turns out. We were done, our table was cleared when yet another very cute young lady came by to inquire about our 3 first courses so far....she was surprised to find out we had been done for a while. Our total check was $550 (service included) for the 2 of us; in this price range one can and should expect more professionalism in the front of the house mainly. All the young women working there that night were dressed like they were the ones going out for NYE....how about a UNIFORM? I would believe this restaurant is Chef owned, typical of the shortcomings in the front of the house....talented Chef though!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for glass of wine. Plan to grab some foodies and head back.  Chef Brendan treated me to a lovely \"teaser\".  Can't wait!  Staff uber attentive...atmosphere uber sexy.  Local and sweet. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"If I could give Sel 6 stars, I would. The food was perfection, the wine pairing was superb with each selection highlighting the dish (and more than worth the extra cost as you get 5 pours with 4 courses). The staff was friendly yet allowed us to enjoy each course and what ended up being an almost 4 hour meal with limited interruption.   We chose this restaurant to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and we felt spoiled!   I'm sure the whole menu is delicious (and it rotates for added variety), but the caliber of skill and taste would suggest that it doesn't matter what you order. We had perfectly cooked scallops, duck like I've never had before (skin cooked separately and added back on as a duck bacon/burnt ends garnish), and perfectly wonderful tiramisu with vanilla bean ice cream. The first three courses were tremendously delicious as well, and I will be dreaming of both the duck main dish and the pressed peach and burrata salad for a very long time."}
{"text":"This was an epic dining experience. The wine pairing blew my mind. The staff was so knowledge from the waitress to the food runner to the busser, everyone was passionate about about the wow food and wine. The chef came out at the end and the wine expert shared his love of local wine. Please come here, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The chef is outstanding!  The menu was diverse and of such high quality and so refined, this restaurant should have a line out the door.  If you are thinking at all of going, please do.  Your taste buds will be dancing in your mouth and you will have a smile with each bite."}
{"text":"Solid fine dining restaurant. Did not blow my mind, but definitely was well prepared, thoughtful and had some nice surprises. Richie our server was wonderful!"}
{"text":"I cannot think of a better place to host a girl's night out. Sel is beautifully decorated, offered excellent customer service and they serve delicious/well decorated 4 course meals for $70 per person. The presentation is truly amazing.   I've made a reservation for the 7 of us and the table was ready as soon as we walked in. We were immediately welcome by our server. As the girls came in one by one, he paid close attention to our table making sure we got our drinks/order as soon as possible. Since I had a destinated driver for the night, I ordered the Barbara Jean ($14: Fords Gin, Giffard Strawberry Liqueur, Chamomile Syrup, Lemon Juice) that was highly recommended by our waiter. It has just the right amount of sweet and I definitely enjoyed it. For my 4 course meals, I ordered a Smoked Lobster Stuffed Squash Blossom (roasted corn puree, pickled Bing cherry), Yellow Tomato Gazpacho, Copper river salmon Gravlaz Salad and Duck breast for main entrée. Everything was delicious except the Yellow Tomato Gazpacho. I simply am not used to having my soup served cold, but my friends all seem to like it. The duck dish was so tender, juicy and delicious and I will definitely order that again. I also tried a bite of my friend's filet Mignon. It was juicy and tender. For dessert, I ordered the strawberry short cake. It was a bit too sweet for my taste and I honestly don't care for it much. I wish they have more choices in dessert, but that was the only choice they offer last night.   Overall, my experience here was amazing! I made a reservation 3 weeks ago for a table of 12 (before 5 girls dropped out on me). They called me the day before asking if we were ok to seat us in the patio area. Needless to say, I was not happy to be asked one day before our reservation. Nevertheless, they were nice about it and ended up seating us in the best area at the restaurant. With that said, keep in mind this restaurant isn't for big group setting due to its size. If you have a party bigger than 8, I'll recommend you to go somewhere else. This is, however, a great place for a date night with your love one.   Thanks again for the wonderful evening Sel."}
