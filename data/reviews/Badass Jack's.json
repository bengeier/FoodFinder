{"text":"I'm kinda a BADASS girl. SO badass in fact, that I even eat badass. Yeah, you heard me.

The best way for me to describe Badass Jack's is that it's like Subway, but with wraps rather than foot long sandwiches. Oh, and it's actually a restaurant, as oppose to just being a sandwich bar.

Picture a cool, happenin' restaurant, with cool, happenin' people, oh, and of course, BADASS wraps. Yeah, I do just like saying it :)

You start off by picking your tortilla. You want Cheddar, Whole Wheat or Sundried Tomato? Check. Then you pick which mix you'd like. I go for the 'Go Veggie'. Check. Then you pick your sauce. I'll have Honey Garlic please. Check. Then you pick what you want your wrap to arrive on: Jasmine rice or Chinese Egg Noodles? Check. Then you decide if you want to make it a combo (adding in either a cookie, a side salad or pita chips & dip) Check. Then YOU EAT.

Easy breezy beautiful Badass Jack's."}
{"text":"Went in to take a look - the name Badass caught my attention plus I am really into wraps these days. From walking in, to walking out, service was just meh, even though the owners knew that we were first time customers coming in to try.
It looks like a Subway when you come in, then you see that they have a spin to the food - Asian inspired wraps, subs and bowls. I opted for a bowl with rice noodles, the hottest sauce (jerk)  they had and shrimp (not on menu, you have to ask for it and of course it is frozen) Basically, the bowl is a stir fry with a protein and veg offering a healthier choice than some other fast food places. It was ready quickly as well and did not taste badly.  Restaurant (some seating) was clean enough. 
I would go back perhaps for another take-out meal, perhaps not. 
I can take it or leave it."}
{"text":"It's actually a 3.5 star. 

This is one of my husbands fave spot, and has been forever. And I have to say for different fast food, it's pretty decent. Plus they advertise what is gluten free. Problem is...not much is. 

I always get the Asian box with with either rice or rice noodles, chicken and honey garlic sauce. So it's good, just not the most variety. And for $6 you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The customer service is eh. I'm in agreement there with all the other reviews. But then again, this isn't a place I go to for customer service and ambience, it's a fast food joint after all and I go for the Food which is by far incredibly yummy, satisfying and overall healthy. I wish this chain would expand to the US as I think it would do EXTREMELY well there. Whenever I come home to Calgary I have to make one pit stop here. If you like spicy their Caribbean Jerk sauce is a must! The wraps are packed with veggies and a meat or protein of your choice, they have ample selection with numerous hot, grilled, or warm wraps which is great in cold Calgary weather. They broccoli salad is decent and cookies are not bad."}
{"text":"Wow,  what a difference 6 months makes with an establishment.    I USED to be a regular long term customer and sadly they are being axed from my rotation.  The food was decent and fairly healthy and I used to be able to over look the extreme lack of customer service abilities by the family that owns and runs the Crowfoot location but they have pushed it too far.   This past summer they offered a \"daily deal\" on one for the flash marketing websites -  $7 for $14 worth of food.   I could buy 20 per person and they were good until December 31st 2011.  Wow!   My boyfriend and I bought 10 together because we liked the food.

In the fall the prices went up (now it's really quite expensive for a fast food joint)  and things were going just fine until Nov 14th when I was told they would no longer accept more coupons from us (I had 5 more that were prepaid).  They told me they had not been paid by the marketing company that sold them.   Despite that not being my problem,  I contacted the marketing company on their behalf asking for a refund or to pressure them to pay up.   They sent me proof that Bad Ass Jacks had been paid.  

I sent my mother in with my remaining vouchers on Dec 30th and she was again told they were not going to be accepted - she walked out.   I contacted the head office to complain afterward.  Originally they were going to send me gift certificates to try out the south store for the value of the vouchers but later got back to me confirming I could use my vouchers at Crowfoot (regardless of them now being past their expiry date of Dec 31).   I went in Jan 6 to use 2 vouchers.  They accepted them but acted really rude and put out.  I was also very uncomfortable as the owner and his wife fought with each other at the till in front of my boyfriend and me.    

Today (Jan 28) we went back to use our last vouchers and were again turned away - they weren't going to honour these because they had already accepted one transaction a few weeks ago from us with different vouchers and these ones were expired.  He didn't understand my argument that if he had accepted them while they were valid I'd be paying full price and not contemplating walking out without paying.   We ended up getting into a verbal disagreement and were told \"[he] doesn't need customers like us\" and that we are  \"just two people and that's not a big deal to his company\" and he's \"tired of us getting so much free food from him\".

If you'd prefer your stir fry, wrap or sub without a side of verbal abuse I recommend you not use any kind of coupons as they do not honour their promotions.  With stir fries at $10 and subs at $8 full price they might still be worth it;  because, for some reason I don't quite understand, there is never any line so you won't wait long.

Despite the fact I paid $70 up front for my 10 vouchers the owner believes I am getting free food -  who authorized this marketing campaign anyway?  Considering this offer was for crowfoot only I assume it was him personally.   At the end he told us to get out and never come back.  We will most happily oblige and would have done so anyway.   I don't think a store that treats honest and loyal customers this way deserves to stay in business and certainly it doesn't  deserve ours."}
