{"text":"Very, very small portion of main meal! I had to go out and buy another meal at the fast-food restaurant! I communicated to manger in place, that the Lamb-Loin meal felt like a rip-off! Also, that taste was not very good. All he said, was sorry, and that is the way it is, and to please come back....Stay away! There are way better options for the money in Montreal! 

Minuscule plat de Longe d'agneau....J'ai sorti avec faim et acheté un autre repas dans un autre resto à côté. SVP ne pas commander ce plat. Le pire c'est que j'en ai parlé avec le gérant et il a seulement souri et dit de revenir...comme s'il s'en fout des clients...La viande n'avait pas de goût et je ne reviendrai sûrement pas à ce resto...il y a bien d'autres options à Montréal!

Plato muy pequeno. Precio muy caro! Lo peor, es que sali con hambre y compre otro plato en otro restaurante! Sugiero evitar este restaurante. Existen tantas otras opciones de restaurantes en Montreal! Mucho, mucho mejores y en donde si les importa el consumidor!"}
{"text":"I have to say, this place is pricey! Be prepared to spend. 

Soup - We had the soup of the day (cream of broccoli) and it was absolutely amazing! ($7)

Beef tartare - to die for! You can also order this as a main course and they claim it's a bit bigger. Next time I would just order the main course version. ($15)

Shepard's pie - delicious, however, not that big a serving for the price ($24)

Fish and chips - absolutely GROSS!!!!! DO NOT ORDER!!!! The fries were soggy and tasted stale / old. The fish was super oily! I took a bite and the fat / grease / oil squirted out. I was so disgusted!!!! ($23)

They give you 1 bread per person! Lol .... I mean, it's all good but really? If i'm paying this much for meals I expect an entire bread basket of WARM bread!!! Lol  

Overall - $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Is it worth it? Not really 
Would I return? Just for the tartare - otherwise NO
Service - it's ok - nothing crazy"}
{"text":"Feels like food that one would get in a premium coach seat on a cheap flight. Dull at best, unoriginal to the nth degree and tasting as thought their chef got cryogenically frozen on a kitsch cruise ship restaurant in the 60s."}
{"text":"Monday night with not much to do and being hungry I had the great idea of heading to the Casino de Montreal for some good food. We got there late and opted for Le Montreal a la carte restaurant. I was pretty excited to taste the food since the Casino of Montreal is renowned for fine dining. We order, the waiter comes back with a ciabatta bread basket, he gives each one of us one. I took the bread to cut it to my surprise it was very hard. Took a bite and tried to chew it almost broke a tooth. It was very hard. So I ask a passing waitress to bring fresher bread, she assures me that our attending waiter will bring some more. Our dishes came but never the bread. My ribs were not well cooked, I had to fight with the knife to get the meat off the bone and my creamy coleslaw salad tasted of vinegar so the rest of the flavors were lost.
The braised beef was more like a Sheppard pie with pulled meat instead of minced. The whole experience was a dull and unflavored one. I was extremely dissatisfied and disappointed. I remembered the food at the Casino to be delicious not faded. Will definitely not return, period. 

P.s.: The waiter was not very enthusiastic and was as soulless as the casino and food."}
{"text":"We dined here in January after receiving gift certificates that allowed us to enjoy a 3 course meal from the special menu.

When coming to the casino, we most often eat at the buffet which shares the same space as this restaurant and offers a variety of quality options (you may read my separate review for Pavillon 67).

Le Montreal has more steak and seafood offerings but after experiencing the buffet, our group found that many of the dishes were too similar to that of the buffet, but in lesser quantities.

I opted for a seafood scallop bisque which was flavorful but not as good as the lobster bisque on the buffet side. This scallop bisque was fishy and very strong. There were hints of lemongrass to freshen this entree but not enough to balance the seafood flavors.

My main dish was the duck breast, glazed in a honey and coffee sauce, served with a potato hashbrown type rotie. As soon as the dish came out, I refrained from laughing as the portion was miniscule. These were bite size pieces and kind of an insult for the price, as on the buffet side, you can get unlimited duck breast with your own choice of sauce.

The dessert was a chocolate mousse cake, nothing special, and once again underwhelming compared to all the buffet options (cakes, cookies, mousses, chocolate fondue, fruits..)

I can't help but compare both restaurants as they share the same space and same kitchen however one is a far better experience.

Perhaps if you are interested in a fancier fish, or large steak such as the tomahawk, pricing close to 100$, the a la carte restaurant may be a good fit, however if you are only looking to spend 40$ or so, the buffet option is a better choice that will allow you to sample far more things.

Also beware, on weekends there are extremely long line ups to eat, you need to come hours in advance to get a ticket, unless you get lucky. Around 6 pm on a saturday I saw many people waiting to eat and were told to only come back after 9pm!"}
{"text":"I was really not impressed with the restaurant for the following reasons 

1- service :
-The service was slow (I would have expected a slow service on a busy night but the restaurant was really empty when we went).
-the waiters mixed plates (have placed food in front of the wrong people at the table)
-Some people ordered drinks that were completely forgotten

2- the food:
I got the stake tartar appetizers and it was good (highly recommended). For the main dish, I got the bavette with vegetables and rice (paella style rice). The bavette was average (not worth what was paid for) the vegetables were not nice and the rice did not look or taste like paella style rice.

As a summary , the price I paid did not match neither the service nor the quality of the food. I do not recommend this restaurant ...."}
{"text":"Ouias ... ils auraient pu se forcer pour l'evenement Mtl à Table ... mais je peux dire que l'ambiance est agreable et pendant une journee d'hivernale on est bien en dedans,  le casino est just à coté ;)"}
