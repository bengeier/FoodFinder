{"text":"The tamales are fantastic! Red pork with banana leaf wrap. Acapulco style.  The cheese enchiladas with green chilie is also amazing! Do NOT judge this place by its outside appearance."}
{"text":"I just had the street tacos (puerca con salsa verde). All I have to say is: wow. Absolutely perfect, and reasonably priced too. Friendly staff, low key atmosphere, and good chips and salsa all combined to make this a win. Next time I'm in Phoenix, I will be back!"}
{"text":"We started our meal sampling all of the aqua frescas. They were all freshly made and refreshing. I couldn't imagine a meal here without one at my side.  All of the food was fantastic. We all shared with each other to sample what they had to offer. The staff were friendly and inviting.  By the end of the meal, we were already planning for what we were going to order during our next visit. It's a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Amazing little Mexican Diner. I could tell it was going to be an experience when I walked in and nothing but hispanics in the place. I had Chillanguillas (on the Breakfast menu). It was phenomenal.  I would eat here every day if I lived here.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"I have found \"THE BEST\" street tacos on earth.  I drive 20 miles to enjoy the fresh made food. I can't get off the street taco kick to try anything else, a.k.a. hooked ! I am very picky about Mexican food as I make a killer salsa that would put most restaurants to shame, ask my people. I love this place and hope for their continued success.  Salsnpaul"}
{"text":"A little skeptical due to location and age of building but agreed to try based of a \"friend of a friend\". HAPPY that we did!! I had the chicken chimichanga- 'chipotle' style also know as chicken tinga, not to saucy, good flavor-smokey a little spice. Generous portion. Went with black beans, nice not mushy! My guy had the special- tamales stuffed with cheese, jalapeño and tomato. I had never seen tamales wrapped in banana leaves, asked the server (who was super friendly and patient- THANK YOU!) and learned it's the style in Mexico City. My guy said his was also \"good\" however his plate was basically wiped clean. ;)"}
{"text":"We were very excited to get another Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood. We pleasantly discovered that they serve a different region of Mexican food - couldn't say what, but it varies from the usual Sonoran fare in the Phoenix area. I had the nachos with chicken, and they were FANTASTIC! Very light ingredients (cilantro, light cheese), not heavy or greasy at all. My boyfriend was also pleased with what he ordered - and he is VERY critical when it comes to Mexican food.  Quick and friendly service, nice atmosphere. We will definitely be back and are so glad to have Guacamole's in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant you've been dreaming of.  Don't let the sign scare you. This is the best kept secret in midtown Phoenix.  Bonkers good flavors. Super fresh and creative ingredients. Incredibly sweet and friendly staff. Embrace the offbeat diner vibe and this'll be your new go-to for fresh Mexican."}
{"text":"We just stop on our way back home from Texas and at first I was a little sceptical of the place but the friendly and very attentive waiter told us they are still fairly new...when the food came out the portions were pretty big(which is great) and tasted great probably on my top 5 Mexican places ...knock out one from my home town in SoCal"}
{"text":"Phenomenal Mexican food, créme de la créme of Phoenix high-end cuisine. Authentic, full of flavour, a true delight to the palette. Strongly recommend the carne asada plate a la carte and the chicken quesadilla with violets and pine nuts, both grilled to a tantalizing, savory perfection with juicy garlic accents over a hearty, filling taste; New York Matinee called it a \"playful but mysterious little dish.\" You'll love it. The charcoal arugula here is outrageous. I paired the steak with a '12 Cab and the quesadilla with a '14 Rosé; their selection of Spanish wines flows excellently with the overall atmosphere and palette. Would also recommend a double Absolut Martini or a J&B straight, though you might feel a little dead by the end of the night!  The maître d'e, Ed(uardo), is courteous and charming, though his humour can be a bit morbid at times! I recommend booking reservations a week in advance at least to avoid being turned away at the door. Wonderful reclaimed restaurant vibes, modeled after a run-down diner; the charming and homely (yet respectable) environment playfully belies the high society atmosphere; even the faux bulletholes in the windows emulate an exciting \"urban\" vibe!  Will return after my business trip to London. Truly to die for."}
{"text":"Doesn't look too exciting from the outside, but I was pleasantly surprised!  The interior still has a 70s sort of diner vibe, but there was plenty of seating on a Friday evening.  I had their enchiladas with chicken and my friend had their conchinita pibil- both were very good and decently sized for the price.  Service was a little disorganized, but overall our waiter was very friendly.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is a small diner looking Mexican restaurant that's is secretly a wonderful sit down place. I am not talking about suit and tie but it is mos def a classy joint. The food is homemade by people you can see in the kitchen and the manager/ owner came to check on us after cooking. The food is amazing and the staff is super friendly.  They also gave us a 20% card. I will be back here again soon"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, clean environment & truly authentic Mexican food like mom makes it. Definitely won me over. Also, their salsas are great, hot as salsas should be."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out and loved it. Very good chicken fajitas! (The rice and beans were a bit bland.) Boyfriend loved the menudo (even available on a Tuesday) and said the service was great! The condiments that came with were exceptional. Normally you have a little side of salsa. This order came with chopped white onions and cilantro, lemons, green salsa, red salsa, pickled red onions, avocado sauce and even salt/pepper. We will be back for dinner again whenever I don't feel up to cooking!"}
{"text":"The food is great. The staff is awesome and super friendly. Drinks were delicious.  Good place to stop and grab a bite to eat before or after a show at the Phoenix Theatre."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Mexican food I have ever had. The ingredients are fresh and the flavor is intense! Great atmosphere and friendly service, they really make you feel at home while you eat. My favorite dish is the chimichanga with carne al pastor. And the dish sizes are huge so bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"I have tried this place 3 times and have been disappointed every time. I want to like it because I enjoy Mexican food and it's very close to work. Unfortunately, the restaurant is dirty, the service is terribly slow, and the food is mediocre. I went yesterday with a group of 4 for dinner. The place was slow, but it took about 15-20 minutes just to place our order. They give you free chips and salsa, but neither salsa is very good. They give you the smallest little taste of guacamole, and my friends ordered more guacamole. They mentioned it would cost extra, and that was fine with us. They brought a generous serving of guac, but we had run out of chips between the 4 of us. We asked for a chip refill and they told us it was $2. What Mexican restaurant charges for a chip refill? Especially for a table of 4?! It would have been helpful to know that before we ordered the guac. The food was fine but took awhile and one of my friend's entrees came out much later than the other 3 without much explanation. Splitting the check and paying was an arduous process and the service was curt at best. If you want Mexican, try Mi Patio downtown or Valle Luna of you live near one. Free chips and salsa with refills at both of those. Bye Guacomole's...three strikes and you are out!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Had the shrimp tostadas and they were delicious, street tacos were yummy and the salsa was actually spicy. authentic horchata too! Definitely coming back to this one"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We are from NYC and always on the lookout for fresh, authentic Mexican food. This is IT.   We came accidentally due to the fact that Spaghetti Factory could not take us, and this was just down the street.  The margaritas are huge and maybe not as strong as they should be, but they do the trick.  The service is amazing. It seems to be a family affair and mother seems to be chef with son as host and server. They are so warm and accommodating   The food is great. As fresh as it could it be.  And soooooo cheap.  Do yourself a favor and GO!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly, family style service! I was working in the area so I stopped in for lunch and was warmly greeted. The fajitas were fantastic with a good mix of meat and veggies and seasoned perfectly. Everything was fresh; rice, salad, tortillas. Generous portions too. The server was on top of things and even the cook asked me how everything was from behind the counter. Only complaint was the smell of cleaning product where I was sitting, but at least I know it's clean. I recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"This was a jewel of a find for my group from Spokane, Wa! Had great interaction with our waitress as we got there a little bit later lunch after going to the Heard Museum. Great food and particularly loved the spicy green salsa. Definitely would recommend for a perfect local spot."}
{"text":"This place is crazy good! Split the street tacos and the carnitas torta with my sister and we were practically drooling through the whole meal. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Service: good + friendly  Food: meh. Ordered the 5 street tacos: one chicken, one pork and 3 carne asana. Like others stated it was lacking in the flavor department. The chicken was beyond spicy though so I couldn't even get a feel for the actual flavor because I had to hurry up and take a swig of some tea. Chips also tasted old... Salsa was very watery. Would have been nice to have some fresh hot chips and some chunkier salsa. The carne asada had a lot of gristle which was pretty disappointing.  Ambience: It's like I went to an older Mexican food place in Mexico. The place is a little disheveled.   Probably won't be back but I hope the owners read the reviews and maybe switch up where they get their meat at, focus on the flavor (marinate longer/get a new recipe), get some hot chips in there and do a little updating and clean up with the decor."}
{"text":"Delicious! We are delighted to have come by. Great ownership and tasty food! A neighborhood fav now and just say your in the neighborhood.... thanks again! Margarita thank you for your hospitality!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Place was empty that should've been a sign to walk out. Our waiter was not friendly at all and the restaurant was freezing cold inside. The salsa and tortilla shell was the best part of the meal. I got the carne asada burrito & it was not good. Meat was bland. The other entree at our table received poor reviews as well. Overall for around $30 including tip it was a waste of money and time!!"}
{"text":"Driving through Phoenix on my way to LA, searched for Mexican food and decided to try this place on a whim. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint. On top of serving great food, the staff were very friendly. You can tell the salsas are made there as well as the aguas frescas. This place is definitely a must try. If you want friendly, welcoming service and tasty food- this place is a go to. Happy Dining!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food was delicious and obviously homemade.  Beyond that was the charming server named Marisela.  I dined alone and she made me feel important and conversed with intelligence. (Which is hard to find anywhere in this country.)  I have traveled from coast to coast literally over 6 years Non-Stop 100% of my time. Rarely do I find a place that I want to return to but I just did your self a favor and enjoy Guacamole Fresh!"}
{"text":"Plenty of love and stars for this local family run restaurant.   Ideally located by the art museum in the old thai place. Off street parking, open Sundays all day, happy hours, full bar including Guinness, great service and everything is authentically cooked from scratch!  Thanks to Yelp for showing us open places on a Sunday afternoon for leading us to this new favorite.    Tortilla chips, made from scratch, salsa, made from scratch and no sugar added (or needed) to make it taste better.  Server and chef were very nice and worked with our allergies and dietary questions.  Great table side guacamole, Posole and fresh grilled vegetables.   Service and chef were really personable, accommodating and friendly.   will be back!"}
{"text":"Good good good Mexican food. Flavors were great. Their salsa are tasty and spicy. Space is clean and well organized. Must try."}
{"text":"When this place opened up near my house, I had to try it. It was good in its earlier life as a Thai restaurant, so I was curious.  My mom and I went in and I had the biggest and most delicious bowl of menudo in a long time. My mom had the street tacos and gobbled them up. Our server was friendly, quick and recommended some of the dishes to us.   Fast-forward a couple months (Oct 2016 that is), and my mom and I go again. We had just come home from a long day traveling and wanted something close to my house, as well as filling and delicious.  The food was good, but our server, Lexly, not so good. My mom order the chilaquiles, and got a bit tongue-tied when she ordered it. Lexly double-checked with her if that's what she wanted and my mom said yes. When our food came out I got my menudo and my mom got her...chimichanga!(?)  When it came time to pay we asked if she could split the check and she said yes. In the restaurant it was us and another customer. Five minutes later we were wondering where our check was, and there was our server still trying to figure out how to split the the check. Now, I've always been taught if you don't know something, ask. If there had been a packed house in the restaurant we could understand the wait, but if she would've told us that she wasn't sure how to split checks with their system, and that would've been fine.  So, first visit was great food and great attentive service. Second visit, great food, though wrong order, and the service had much to be desired."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this restaurant and it was wonderful. The food was really good and fresh, I usually don't order a chile relleno but I'm glad I did. It tasted authentic and flavorful, I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"Nothing to look at need some work, paint some art work, service was good thought there was only one waitress and cook. But the food was fair a little bland but with a little spices and salt n pepper it's fine I will be going back."}
{"text":"Spotted this place while we were visiting the Art Museum. Came in on a Sunday & we first thought they were closed but turns out they extend their hours past 3 on Sundays.  Their michelada is one of the best I've had in Phx! This is coming from someone who's had dozens from Tucson/Phx.  Got the 5 street tacos which did not disappoint!  I was amazed by the quality of tacos for only $7!   Definitely recommending this place for friends in the area. This place deserves more business for their good quality \"home made\" food for amazing prices!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to try something new and went to this restaurant. I got the flauta plate and immediately after we left I started feeling sick. Well needless to say I spent the rest of the night throwing up and felt absolutely horrible!!! I had never had food poisoning like that and i wouldn't wish it on anyone!  I would never go back there nor recommend it to friends. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"First time here 1 waiter 8 customers took him 10 mins for our drink order just drinks , goes back and is talking to the same guests he was helping when we first arrived food piling up ready on the kitchen shelf plus the other patrions still waiting for him to order what a disappointing experience. On to the next one."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise I found. I'm into enchiladas, I've loved them from Day 1.   I stopped in here tonight, sight unseen, for a quick dinner. Why of course, I noticed their enchilada special for $8.75. I'm midway thru dinner...my enchiladas are TASTY, smothered in red sauce,  with black beans and rice.  My server is of Spanish descent, she's friendly, polite and efficient. Am I a HAPPY camper ?  ABSOLUTELY !!"}
{"text":"Came back because the first time we had some great authentic tacos. This time didn't disappoint yet the service was slow but the cook is really awesome!! Hubby had the 3 steak tacos which he always loves. I went with the grilled shrimp tacos, so so good & they use the medium size shrimp which is really nice!! Everything was freshly made & perfectly cooked, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had the chilli Relleno. Chilli was dried and burnt. Rice was bland. Pinto & black beans were MOR bean. Had al pastor chimichunga, simply decent. Mediocre."}
{"text":"the food was super good! the service was great even though we came in right before they closed...but the margaritas are what i'll be coming back for!!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican breakfast in downtown Phoenix!! I got the Huevos Mexicanos. It was delicious. Affordable too"}
{"text":"Staying in an Airbnb in the FQ Story neighborhood, there aren't many restaurants within walking distance. This one, right across the street from the Phoenix Art Museum (free admission Wednesdays after 3) was the perfect choice for me and my friend. Waiting at the counter with margaritas, we ordered food to go - carnitas and fajitas. When getting home, we discovered a package with fresh, authentic, and flavorful food. Nothing was heavily sauced nor greasy. It was light and abundant, the red salsa hot, the green milder, and the carnitas tender."}
{"text":"went here for national taco day and we loved it!! super good tacos and friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"This was literally the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. When we walked in, there was a dirt covering the entire walkway leading to the door, a result of a messy project midst dinner hours. The waitress didn't even ask for our drink order until after we ordered our food and had to ask about drinks. The waitress then still took another 15 minutes to finally bring the simple water orders over (long after the nasty starter chips were gone and we very thirsty). When the food finally arrived, our table's order did not come together and 3/4 of the plates were not right. We complained and they fixed it but the enchiladas contained the wrong meat still and were plain NASTY. We had all finished our waters and it took yet another 5 minutes for our waitress to notice, after we called her attention from her phone she had plugged in very visible to the public. We didn't get the tortillas that came with our meals until 10 minutes after the entré. During the entire visit, there were many flies all around us and our food. When the meal was over we asked to speak to the manager, who was blatantly uncaring for my opinion. She did not offer, and refused any discount or other compensation for our poor experience. So I paid $25 for a meal of 2, untouched plates, bland chips/salsa and water we had to wait 30 minutes for. I should have known this place would be awful based off of the ran down outside appearance."}
{"text":"The cuisine is a few steps up from what you might expect, this is not a \"\"bertos, or even a generic sit down Mexican place. This also means the prices are a few dollars higher too.   Holding true to their name every tables comes with guacamole along with the chips and salsa. Sure it is literlya thimble full. A cup so small it would not even hold a single dose of children Tylenol would, but it is a nice touch. There is some salsa and a chips too.   I had the chilliie rellno which was quite good. The shape and texture was well defined as was the cheese inside, the sauce was also a good match. The rice was standard the the black beans were a nice touch. all for about a $10 lunch."}
{"text":"Why 4 stars instead of 5? It's a little rough around the edges when you walk in the front door and their rice was dry and tasted like it was out of a box but I didn't come here for the rice because...tacos. And their tacos are GOOD! I tried the chipotle chicken first and thought it was pretty good but the barbacoa is what I would come back for. My friend had the ceviche and was very happy with that too. The presentation of the food is great, just try to overlook the presentation of the restaurant.  Good salsa too.  Oh I almost forgot! They offer a \"locals\" discount of 15% if you live or work nearby.  Check 'em out!"}
{"text":"Disappointing lunch experience.  It took 40 minutes to receive my shrimp burrito.  Waitress said they were busy; there were 13 customers in the restaurant (including me). The burrito was 85 percent sloppy rice and was served fully wrapped in paper, cut in half, and plopped down on a plate. No rice, no beans, no condiments, etc. Tasted Ok. Don't go, if you are in a hurry or wanting a semi nice sit down lunch experience."}
{"text":"I had a craving for mole, and 30 minutes to spare before a site across the street, so I strolled right in and order the mole rojo plate.  & I'm glad I did! The mole was delicious enough to satisfy my craving, and the rice n' pinto beans were excellent. I usually don't finish those two sides, but it wasn't a problem this time around. The rice was not too dry, and beans not overcooked.  The restaurant also had chips as house appetizers. Though, both the green and red salsas were very spicy--I recommend mixing it with the small cup of guacamole they also provide.   Overall, and excellent place for a meal!"}
{"text":"The most amazing guacamole I've ever had. The salads is fabulous. The service is incredible... so are the margaritas. You won't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"We came in to buy a coke. They refused our service. Apparently you have to spend a certain amount to be a customer. Horrible customer service, would never go back."}
{"text":"This Mexican food is fantastic!!! They have homemade horchata, which is so delicious. I got a black bean chimichanga (I asked for no sauce) and was blown away with the first bite. The lady at the bar, who looks like the manager was really sweet and made sure we were taken care of. The prices are really great for the large portions and I will definitely be back!! Ps they are called guacamole for a reason, the guacamole was divine!"}
{"text":"I was in a party of 6, and we were seated, then it took 10 minutes before our waitress came around to get our drink order. Then she brought one drink and not the others. After another 10 minutes, our party wanted to leave. It took another 10 minutes for the waitress to come to the cash register to get our money for the drink. We never got to even order food, so I dont even know if it's good."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while exploring Phoenix. There was a lunch rush and only one person working the front (hosting, serving, and making drinks). This made for slower service, but that did not hinder how great it was. Our server was friendly, helpful, and hardworking. The chips and salsa were great. I ended up getting a burrito with black beans, rice, guacamole, lettuce, and tomato. It was so fresh, tasty, and filling. I'm so impressed by this place and hope to return :)"}
{"text":"$10 for a small bowl of Menudo? Is this place for real? Ordered a $11 breakfast burrito that was underwhelming at best. No flavor, and about half the size of a burrito you'd get from Norteno or any other taco shop for half the price. Gave this place a second shot but was let down again. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great family owned close to Phoenix Theater.  Margarita was our server and owner.  They currently don't have a liquor license for drinks on menu.  I had 2 tacos chicken and carne asada, tasty.  The red salsa is very good almost a gazpacho. The green is very hot but mixed with red perfect for us.  We had complimentary chips and salsa and were given 2 agua frescas fresh not too sweet.  Attentive service."}
{"text":"Looking for lunch on Friday afternoon, driving around aimlessly. Passed by Guacamoles the other day, purposely drove in that direction. Passed by it again, pulled up on Yelp, u-turn, let's check it out. Order the \"3 Traditional Tacos\" everything on them. *barbacoa. Really?  fooled me where's the flavors, okay add salsa *carne asada.  Meat needs to be marinated, again no flavor add green and red salsa *cochinita pibil. Not bad the best of the 3, but that doesn't say much add salsa  verde I might go back to try something else in the future,"}
{"text":"Not allowed to use the restroom if you buy a bottle of water.... poor customer service"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!! Roaches everywhere and the old lady working tonight was spitting on the floor when no one was looking!!!! 5/2/17 7:16pm! HEALTH DEPARTMENT GET ON THEN PLZZZZ!"}
{"text":"The staff was really nice. However I didn't really like my grilled shrimp burrito. It was very dry and a bit too salty."}
{"text":"This place was just all-around bad. Mediocre to poor food (told my husband it reminds me of food you'd get in some tiny town on the side of the highway), weird smell, awful decor including laminated table cloths, unfriendly waitress, and... worst of all, no lime for my beer. I won't be back, liked the Thai Hut better."}
{"text":"Poisonous air fresheners everywhere. Your face gets blasted with air freshener chemicals when you walk in. There were two scented candles in the dining area. What are they trying to cover up?  The service was slow and disorganized and the food was gross. The rice was dried out. The tamales fell apart and were gloppy and had tough meat. Won't be going again."}
{"text":"This place is not your typical Mexican little whole in the wall. It's got a liquor license, it's got superb service, it truly is fresh, and it's more expensive than most. Meals are huge and they take their time to prepare them from scratch. What I ordered was delicious and I took more than half to go."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Place was pretty dead. Waiter was quick to seat me and processed my order: carne asada chimichanga, horchata and got some house chips and salsa.  Chips were dripping with oil. Tasty but just too greasy.  Chimi arrived quickly and looked great. The taste was another story. Bland. Nothing special and just average.   This is NOT authentic Mexican. Sorry to all the gringos out there who think otherwise. I would choose 10 other nearby, hole-in-the-wall Mexican joints over this one any day.  Peace out."}
{"text":"Was hesitant to try, but pleasantly surprised. Had street tacos and partner had enchiladas. Both dishes were nicely spiced. Food was filling without all the extra grease and salt you get at most Mexican Restaurants. Wait staff was friendly and nice. Mama even came out and had a few friendly exchanges. I only give 4 stars because their was no plain ice tea. Will definitely be stopping in again. Oh...almost forgot... The meal was about $22 to feed two adult males. Perfect hit on the pocket book!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican restaurant.  My wife and I spent the afternoon at the art museum. Walking back to the car we smelled something delicious.  We stopped in and had dinner. The food was awesome. My wife had the mole and I had carne asada carnitas. We are happy with our choices."}
{"text":"The food is from Central Mexico, which is different than the typical Sonoran fare most are used to.   The same style and quality food, as Barrio Café, but half the price and double the portions.   It's a comfortable and friendly place, still as close to original  (even the cool lighting fixtures) and complete as when it was a Sambos...and that must go back.  Oh, they actually make their generous margaritas with a shaker."}
{"text":"Service was ok, but menudo was cold and tough, either undercooked, old or over cooked. Fix that, please."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly, and the service is great.  The food is all made from scratch! From the tortillas to the mole.  I wanted a chile relleno burrito, and although not on the menu, they made me one.  And ooooooh wow! It was the best chile relleno burrito that I have ever had.  It came with some grilled onions, and a roasted jalapeno on the side.  I enjoyed them with the burro.  I was also given a sample of the molè. It paired so perfect with the burrito. I think ill be going back for dinner, and having the same meal, but this time enchilada style with the mole sauce."}
{"text":"This place was so good. Me and my boyfriend stopped here on the way to the light rail and I'm so glad we did. Our waiter was very fast, friendly, and personable. I got the five street tacos.. SO GOOD! My boyfriend got the chicken enchiladas with red sauce, also super super good. Unfortunately we had to take our food to go to get back home but this quick stop was absolutely amazing and I definitely plan to come back by next time I'm in Phoenix  :)"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you can tell this is a family business. They put their energy into what they do and it shows in their food. Get up and go! You will enjoy!"}
{"text":"The  worst mexican food I have ever had. If i could give them half a star or no stars I would. The salsa tasted like water. We got the carne asada quesadilla. There was barely any cheese and hardly any meat.  The meat had no flavor. Oh man it was horrible and it was way too expensive for the quality of food we got.  You could not pay me to go back."}
{"text":"great service. excellent price. amazing food. 10/10 will recommend. 10/10 coming back.  they have a VARIETY of food. Thank you Margarita ."}
{"text":"this place is great ! The Baracoa beef was maybe the bet I ever had.  Its kind if stuffy and dark inside with the black paint but the food is great !"}
{"text":"Came in about 3 after the Heard Museum. Mostly looking for low dollar signs. Wife and I are literally blown away. She didn't share her street tacos, which means quite a lot. Each Taco was different. I had Pork tamales in red sauce wrapped in banana leaves (Acapulco style). Some of the best I've ever had. And I'm a tamale whore. The side was a sweet champurrado that was lovely. We shared a bowl of posole with all the fixings. Quite mild, so when we asked if it can be spicy, she smiled, kind of winked, and brought out some type of dried red chilles to crush and sprinkle in. Perfect.   Finish everything off with $2 Miller lites, and I'll say \"it's really a 5 star experience on a 2 star budget!\""}
{"text":"It's hard to find authentic Mexican food in downtown Phoenix (surprisingly), but this is the spot. Especially good for soups. Posole, caldo de res, menudo. You know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"This place is legit.  The salsas are amazing, each unique and homemade so you can't find them anywhere else.    The food is fresh with a unique perspective. The spices, flavors, and the staff that make it were excellent.  I went home one happy customer.    Definitely will be back! Thanks Guacomoloes!"}
{"text":"I tried this new place tonight and I loved it!  When you  sit down you feel like your eating at home.  They have mom and family in the back making your meal and coming around if you are enjoying it.  It's very welcoming and authenticate.  They gave chips and salsa which was good, but I requested something hotter.  They gave us a spicy red and guacamole one that will kick your butt!  The rice reminds me of my sisters and the beans like my mom.  I had the flautas and my boyfriend had the fajita's.  I loved them both and he loved the fajita's, which is saying much as he complains about how basic they can be, but they way they marinated them was very good.  Thank you for the great service and food!  Now I have to try the mole."}
{"text":"We had looked forward to trying this new local restaurant but were overall pretty disappointed. The waitress was in training and it had to be her first night, ordering was painful and she knew nothing of the menu. It took quite a while to make our drinks but the margaritas were fresh and tasty. I ordered the street tacos and 2-3 of them were actually very good (couldn't tell you which ones they were since I ordered a variety and neither server could tell me which meat I was served in which taco). My boyfriend ordered a deep fried carnita burro and although the meat was good the fry oil made everything taste like fish. The chips were fresh and good, the pico tasted like it was tomato based sauce and was not very good. They give you a small cup of guacamole which was pretty flavorless and a green salsa which is SUPER HOT! We were the only ones in the restaurant so based on service and inconsistencies in the food I am not sure I would go back. Too bad, I was hoping to have a tasty new neighborhood place to frequent."}
{"text":"The salsa didn't have very much flavor and was watery. The \"super\" nachos were \"super\" cheeseless. The nachos came out soggy and the chicken had a sweet flavor. Definitely would not recommend the nachos. However, the chimichanga and the street tacos were very good and the staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Oh my! Just found this gem in my neighborhood. The chicken burrito I ordered was so delicious, but the green sauce... amazing!"}
{"text":"Really great food at a reasonable price. Quality authentic Mexican food and it comes with great service. So far I haven't found one bad thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Guacamoles is on of the few places that have been at this location that worked quite well, and assuming they receive  good enough business, they could even be a downtown staple.  First off, the location is nothing much, but not many renovations and decorations were ever added to the actual location in the first place. I love the fact that they give you a sample of Guac with the chips, I think a lot more places should do that. The server was very friendly and attentive to refills and requests. The rest of the kitchen staff were just as friendly.  I ordered the Chicken Fajitas that came with rice and beans, and some tortillas. I was familiar with the taste of the dish because I order this plate many times, but the spices and portion that Guacamole's gave me filled me up really fast.   Overall, if you are downtown and need a little Mexican food to hold you over, I would absolutely make a stop here."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food at an awesome price. Whether it's a huge mug of horchata or bomb street tacos, this place is underrated."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch when visiting Phoenix and was very pleased with the quality of the cuisine and the attentive, friendly service.  I had a burrito enchilada style with red sauce. Done to perfection. Could have fed two easily. The atmosphere is casual like an old-fashioned diner for breakfast and lunch, and they also have a more formal dining room for evenings. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I was a little apprehensive as the place only had 1 other table of guests at 5 pm but I was there and hungry enough to give them a try. My server was quick to bring fresh chips and salsa which was very watery and tasteless but with salt was ok. I ordered the chicken mole which consisted of a large, juicy chicken breast smothered in a wonderful mole sauce. Wow, is all I can say. The sides of rice and beans were bland but mixed with the extra mole made them delightful. This mole is neck and neck with my favorite from Huatalco, Mexico and a must if you are in the area. The salsa and sides being bland have me wondering about other menu options but I will be back for the chicken mole."}
{"text":"Every have someone bring you a lunch so good, it's like a life-changing experience?  that was me, enjoying my favorite Southwestern dish, the chimichanga. Only this one wasn't like the others. Filled with the most flavorful adobada I've seen in my life, the seasoning was so intense that your average diner would need to accompany this with like a gallon of water. It was so packed with a bright red coating of pepper, I swear I was tasting chiles for the rest of the day. You truly are what you eat, and for a day I was one spicy yelper!  I dreamt of this chimi for days, and finally had a chance to dine in and see it all up close. Let me tell you, dining in is completely worth it, and should be done whenever possible! Meals come with chips, two varieties of spicy (yet totally amazing) salsas, and a small cup of guacamole that will leave you wanting to purchase much more.   On this visit, I tried the carnitas and was just as impressed. As was I with the perfect black beans, and the slightly salty and citrus-y rice. Every single item at Guacamole's is carefully seasoned to a symphony of sensations any palate can appreciate, and that's why it's great. For the same amount I'd spend at one of the many fast casual restaurants nearby, I received a filling meal that was made with care. This is the real deal.   It just doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a good review because it has a few stars built up. I want to say maybe I ordered the wrong thing but that's not really making a good excuse. Everything on the menu should be good and tasty. I ordered a traditional breakfast  dish of Chilaquiles, served with scrambled eggs and a side of black beans. Let me just start by saying that none of these three items were all that great at all. The eggs were overcooked and dry, the beans were tasteless and look like they had microwaved and been overheated as most of them had skins that were coming off, (as if left in the microwave too long?) , and the Chilaquiles sauce was dry, and overly spicy.  I left with a terrible case of heartburn it was just too much chili. At $7.60 for this I thought the pricing was reasonable, however not for this the way it was prepared. The chips they dye them Green and red.  They were just OK, nothing special. The salsa was good, but the cups that they give you and are very tiny and you have to keep asking for refills.  They serve a tiny teeny cup of guacamole with the chips.  It was OK but if you wanted more it's three dollars extra.  One other annoying factor was the waiter was on the phone when I arrived, he also has like an iPad going or some kind of other tablet. So I really couldn't tell if he was focusing on me and getting my order or just multitasking.  I want to say that I will be back to try something different, but realistically with so many other Mexican places to try in Phoenix, I am not really sure that I'll be back anytime soon. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Some of the best carnitas tacos ive ever had. Good food and the waitress was cool as s#$t! Would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"The decor could be updated to something that represents the mexican culture. The chips are ok, the salsa is too watered down and bland. Not as much flavor to the salsa as other places I have gone to. I ordered the adobada green enchiladas which were amazing!! I ordered my son 3 carne asada tacos. They were ok but were garnished pretty cool. I also ordered a fresh made watermelon drink. That drink was orgasmic to my taste buds! So refreshing so flavirful and ice cold!! So this time around the salsa that was given to me was past due and I told the server. She went and let the cook know. I wasnt given a menu in the beginning. I would go back for the seasonal drink, in this case the watermelon drink. If Im around and hungry I will come back. Will also recommend this place. They do need to spruce it up and make it look good."}
{"text":"Gave it a try cause it's in our neighborhood. Good.   Positives: -waitress was lovely. Sweet and helpful and attentive and funny.  -hubster had pork tamales which were exceptional -guacamole excellent. We think it may be the best we've had in quite a while -generous portions and low prices  Negatives: -overwhelming stench of chemical air fresheners upon entering.  -have to get a key to the not so clean bathroom -sad tired setting(a former Denny's building perhaps?)  Neutral: -tacos were pretty good. Carne Asada a bit bland. Al oastor and carnitas good"}
{"text":"From the service to the food this place rocked! We were quickly greeted and sat.  Everyone said hi to us including the chef.  She even came out after the meal to make sure we were pleased with everything.  We were super pleased with the street tacos.  I highly recommend the chinga and el pastor.  We also had the breakfast burrito which was wonderful.  I love being able to get breakfast for dinner! Even better were the prices! Very fairly priced.  We've been looking for a good Mexican restaurant since we moved to this part of town and we finally found it!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. When I walked up to the doors the first thing I see was a used needle with no cap laying right in the center of the entrance. As if that was not alarming enough, the person that greeted my husband and I told us that he could not use the restroom because we were only having drinks and not dining. We asked to speak to a manager and were denied. I highly recommend skipping this experience and going any where else but here."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy or trendy here, just excellent food and friendly service in a neighborhood type place so this is my kind of place. The pork enchiladas with green sauce were spot on with rice and black beans. This went perfectly with a freshly made $5 Coronarita. Only weird thing here was they claimed they only had bottled water since the tap water wasn't working, huh? Either way this place is definitely worth a try and I'd come back here often if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Tacos are great. Taco Tuesday special is wonderful. BUT never come here on a tight timeline. They are terribly understaffed or they are just really really really slow. Not sure but eat ahead of time and plan to hang out and wait for food and drinks"}
{"text":"Straight authentic. Simple Mexican food done great. It is an old diner they cleaned up nice. You can see the kitchen and everything looks clean. I had the \"5 Street Tacos\" with carne asana, a bowl of the pozole, and a glass of jamaica. Totally awesome."}
{"text":"I am so appalled by the service they have here their food is junk I think there's bugs in their food"}
{"text":"I drive by this place everyday and didn't even realize it was here. Stopped in for the lunch and got the lunch special and was not disappointed. Rice and beans were awesome and the Barbacoa Tostada was great. Hot salsa was good w spice, Service was good, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by their coy startup bullshit... this place sucks... couldn't believe the staff wouldn't even refill the bathroom with soap and paper towels... toilet seats falling off, crappy attitude from the staff.... I mean come on, the resteraunt was nearly empty and when I voiced my concern about the soap and paper towel situation, I was met with disdain and a frank from the owner mind you \" your not obligated to eat hear, you can go\" like W T F... wanted to give my lady a green light to punch that waitress in the face... I'm saying if my Son is using the facilities and the lame staff is trying to conceal condescending comments by speaking Spanish to undermine my call to attention that the restrooms are worse than truck stop port-a-potties and I know what they are saying because I speak Spanish fluently then that tells me that they care nothing about bacteria free cooking surfaces and sterile clean hands touching my food, and that blatant rude and if I may use Grotesque customer service and food prep habits... Hands down the worst shittery I have ever visited... Good thing I walked out on that shitty eatery... Probably would of been eating the shit off their hands in my food... Stay clear of this ER visit.... wouldn't let my dogs eat here.... Review #1.... Horrible service and very rude mouthy waitresses. Bathrooms are falling apart toilet seats falling off the toilet, filthy, and with no soap available even upon request meaning no employees wash their hands!!! Major health code violation. Zero stars. Wouldn't even let my dogs eat here."}
{"text":"Food is so good and authentic. Lady cooks do an awesome job. Went for lunch and I love my barbacoa taco salad then got bfast it was sooo good.   Only suggestion is getting bigger guacamole sides. But I asked for more and there was no problem. Give it a try ;)"}
{"text":"The service was amazing, margarita I think that was her name was so nice and friendly! Food was so good.. I had the carintas taco and pasole so good! Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"Customer service was terrible. My boyfriend and I could not use the restroom because we just wanted to order drinks and we're not dining in."}
{"text":"A decent place for Mexican food. The atmosphere and service were not particularly great. The whole place looks a bit cheap like they didn't want to spend any money on the tables, counters, menus, etc. the food, though, was pretty good. The carne asada plate and chimichanga we're both large and tasty. They provide chips with a little guacamole. Not bad overall."}
{"text":"This is downtown Phoenix best kept secret. Authentic Mexican food at a great price. Great service combined with good food makes it a great restaurant. I ordered the chicken and potatoes enchiladas and was surprised at how good it was. My wife had the chimichanga and kept saying how good it was while she was eating lol! You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I think I'll take the \"write as I go\" approach because I really have to talk about this salsa and I may not write anything later. So here we are- lets start with the atmosphere (just kidding I don't care about atmosphere so I'll just move it along and you can get your atmosphere business from someone else). The service is precious and they're so kind and welcoming- bless their hearts. Where was I? THE SALSA! Right so, what fresh hell did you just give me Guacamole Fresh Mexican Grill!? Picture this: weird brine tomato water with a couple pieces of salsa type ingredients. It comes with the table so it's not an end-all for me but c'mon! SALSA? Whatever-   I see the food   ITS COMING. Standby.............................   Yea okay holy smokes. The Cochinita Pibil is outrageously delicious if you dig savory slow cooked pork. Also, the cucumber agua fresca with chia seeds? Yes please Super quenchy and refreshing.  Advice: ask tons of questions like \"is it spicy?\", \"is it sweet?\", \"is it a cold?\", \"I hear your salsa blows, why?\", Etc. Don't assume you understand something at face value. This is definitely the kind of place where you might be disappointed if you go in loaded with expectations because you ate something similar somewhere else. That's just bad etiquette in the culinary world. Give it a try and talk about it y'all! They seem to really care about guest impressions so perhaps, together, we can resolve this salsa nonsense. Remember kids, table salsa is important. Ta ta!"}
