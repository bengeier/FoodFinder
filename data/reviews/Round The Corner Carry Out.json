Also got some yummy ranch on the side.  The staff was incredibly friendly, we will order from here again!!"}

{"text":"I am not from Gibsonia but from what I gathered from the employees this place is brand spanking new. They even let me taste test a buffalo chicken pizza they were working on... I might drive the 45min from my house to get one when it hits lol.   I got an extra cheese and a pep mushroom pie. Super freakin delicious, not sure what's going on to make crust so amazing but it is. Too bad I live so far away :("}
{"text":"Tried it out last night and am super excited to have this place around!  We ordered Breadsticks, Extra Cheese Pizza, and an Italian Hoagie.   The breadsticks were so soft and chewy!  You can tell the dough is made from scratch, and fresh!  Along with their delicious sauce.  It's not your typical pizza place, they have set themselves aside with that one!   The pizza was a thinner crust all around, but chewy and so delicious.  They have to use a good quality cheese, there wasn't a pile of grease sitting on top of the extra cheese, which was lovely!  There wasn't a piece left!   The Italian Hoagie was our favorite.  The meat was sliced thick and piled on!  We had the dressing on the side, but you most definitely didn't even need it with the flavor that sandwich had!  Will most definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"We have tried the breadsticks, Italian hoagie, sausage pizza and loved them all. However, nothing compares to the steak ranchero pizza. My husband and I are obsessed! We got it last week and plan on getting it again this week. We love it there!"}
{"text":"Solid business. Honest owners.  Excited to see all this quality establishment has to offer!"}
{"text":"We just moved into the neighborhood.  I ordered a large Garden Salad with Italian dressing and the Margarita Pizza with red sauce.  The salad was VERY fresh and big.  The pizza has a delicious, chewy crust reminiscent of a good wood fired oven pizza crust.  It hit the spot !!!!!!"}
