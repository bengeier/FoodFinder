{"text":"Just moved to the area and absolutely fell in love with this food truck BBQ. I highly recommend the Rib tips for anyone looking for a unique way to have a spare rib. They cut the rib into smaller pieces and load them into a to go container. Delicious!!! The girlfriend swears by the potato salad, and Cole Slaw. If your in the Moore Chapel area I highly recommend due to nothing quite like it in the are. Be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately some of the worst brisket I've ever had, and I've eaten A LOT of brisket"}
{"text":"I think I have found my new favorite bbq! This place is AMAZING! Limited menu but each bbq item is delicious. The riblets are probably the best item there though. They also have fried chicken, smoked sausage, croaker and flounder. A few side items and a couple of desserts. If you want to try anything that has to be fried it has to be before 6, they cut the fryer off at 6 to give it time to cool off. Everyone should know about this place! Friendly owners, delicious food? What more could you ask for?! Spread the word! P.s. I would have taken a picture of my food but I ate it too fast hahaha"}
{"text":"I consider myself a well sorted bbq fan who is ofter let down by dry meats, over done sauces and unjustified pricing.  I've been passing this corner over a month and finally stopped. Im glad i did, the ten dollar brisket sandwich did not let down.  If i cant make it myself, ill be stopping by everytime."}
{"text":"Ok-- I tried the brisket and the fried corn, which is never had. I immediately asked to speak to the owner. Terry came out of the trailer and shook my hand. I asked him how long he's been working on this run recipe, and his answer was shocking. Some people have a TRUE GIFT. He could be retired, but he and his wife love serving the community so much they mixed it with their other favorite past time: BBQ! If you ever EVER spot this truck--sprint there!!!! The brisket will change your life, and you'll wanna shake terry's hand too!!!"}
