{"text":"Hey listen,   This is probably the last TRUE diner in the downtown area.   There's one dish that you should go out of your way to try. It's called \"Just Eggs\", and what comes to your table will surprise you.   Go and check out, give me a shout after."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most fantastic deli for pastrami and corned beef sandwiches in Toronto Great prices great service not much room so you have to squeeze in but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Our office moved to Camden St. and I had to give this place a try. Ordered the Montreal smoked meat sandwich on rye. *THAT* was good. Generous amount of meat and a big plate of really good fries came with it (crisp on the outside, tender and not soggy on the inside).  What a time machine, it's like 1974 in there, but, it's not like they're putting it on, it's just real. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Best place to grab a bite to eat, during your lunch break! Small sitting arrangement though, so order out if you're with a big group."}
{"text":"Finally! A greasy spoon diner downtown! I know it's been there for ages, but with it not being open on weekends, it was hard to make it for breakfast. I'll say for $5, it was a good meal with good portions. I actually really liked the potatoes that came with the eggs; they were soft and seasoned nicely. I'm not sure how many times I'll be able to make it back, given the hours, but I'm happy to know that the option is there."}
{"text":"Working along King West, this place is a welcome alternative to the many premium priced lunch joints in the area. It's a tiny brown bag lunch diner that that serves big hearty servings at very reasonable prices. I've tried everything including the Montreal smoked meat sandwich(!!!), chili, daily soup 'n toast, short ribs, roast beef dinner, turkey dinner, meatloaf, fries 'n gravy and mac 'n cheese. Love them all."}
{"text":"Ok I have tried everything here and it's all excellent.  It just depends on what you feel for.  Burgers are great, poutine is FANTASTIC (they are the only ones I have found to use real cheese curds), Mac and Cheese on Fridays, filet of sole, deli meat on rye... the list goes on and on.  It's your typical diner inside, clean but comfortable.  Huge line ups form at lunch. It's like coming home."}
{"text":"Best greasy spoon place downtown, bar none! Food is cheap and delicious and the service and the atmosphere is a throwback to the 60s. So is their cash-only policy but as long as you bring cash, you'll leave happy and with a full belly!"}
{"text":"Avenue Deli is the place to go if you want good home cooking, generous portion sizes at reasonable prices.  Considering its hidden off a Spadina side street, its quite busy and you can see lineups out the door in all types of weather.  We go there for lunch at least twice a week.  Things I recommend:  - fries w/ gravy (true diner style) - onion rings (perfectly crisp, just the way I like it) - mac n' cheese (generous portion served with salad) - BLT (when I first ordered this I ordered a soup as well, thinking I'd still be hungry. Boy was I wrong - the BLT was loaded with tomatoes, crispy bacon and lettuce.  Well worth the price!) - braised short ribs (although I did have an unfortunate accident where the bag broke and I had sauce dribbling down my jacket - the short ribs with gravy and veggies were extremely tasty) - smoked meat or pastrami or corned beef sandwich (excellent meat to rye ratio) - western sandwich (sometimes I just want an egg sandwich doused with Tabasco for lunch, ya know?) - jerk chicken (you're probably wondering - jerk chicken from a diner?  trust me, its good stuff) - club sandwich w/ fries (a proper triple decker) - any of their soups (they're homemade and fresh every day)  I can keep going...but now I'm too hungry.  Be sure to check out their daily specials, you're liable to find some new favorites in there!"}
{"text":"They let me order poutine at breakfast, so I was happy.  On a Saturday morning, it was mostly locals and a few take-away orders.  Standard hole-in-the-wall diner.  Eggs were well-cooked, potatoes were fine, french toast was basic but good. And the poutine...well, I don't actually like poutine, but...I was in Canada, so...poutine."}
{"text":"I love this place but I am partial to a greasy spoon and Avenue Open Kitchen does not disappoint. I am a big fan of their all day breakfast, deli sandwiches, salads (love the Greek one) and their mac and cheese.   Yes it takes cash only and sometime, mostly Fridays at lunch the line ups can be pretty big. But the guys behind the counter have their service routine down to an art form and you are never waiting too long for what awesome daily special or yummy menu item you have ordered."}
{"text":"Se come muy rico, está todo muy barato y sirven porciones grandes. Hoy desayuné 'peameal bacon & eggs' te lo sirven con papas fritas estilo home, pan tostado, mermelada, mantequilla y café con refill por $8.95!! Si vas después de las 11:00 am, te sale un dólar más caro. Vale la pena!!"}
{"text":"Great little spot! If you're craving home-style cooking, this is the place. The daily specials are amazing - every Wednesday they do a full Turkey dinner complete with stuffing and cranberry sauce. The all-day breakfast always hits the spot. The staff are lovely and they get to know you and make conversation. Plus, you'll get more cheese curds on your poutine here that at any poutine place in the city (pretty sure, anyway)."}
{"text":"They give you a lot of delicious food made fresh very quickly. It's a bit cramped but that's because it's so crowded from everyone wanting to eat their awesome food. I would recommend the hot chicken to anyone who likes gravy."}
{"text":"Quick service which is good because the spot is tiny. Enexpensive and pretty good! I got the vegetarian omelette! Great big portions as well!"}
{"text":"Perfect. Cheap, simple, quick and tasty. Can't really ask for more. If you're a greasy spoon fan, than Avenue Open Kitchen is a winner. Great spot for a weekend brunch or just a quick lunch during the work week."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for quite awhile now, since I live in the area. The poutine is just heavenly! The fries are always made to order and the cheese curds are squeaky and ample. Gravy is delicious too! Also, can't beat the value and the portion size!  The place is quite small and can get hectic during lunch time, but the guys who work there are extremely nice and service is always prompt. I've never waited more than five minutes for my food, no matter what and when I order.   They are also open on Saturdays now, so perfect place for brunch too, since their breakfast menu is also awesome!"}
{"text":"Found this in Yelp and decided to give it a try.  Was not disappointed....  Great meal and reasonable prices.  Kids loved the egg bacon sandwich and the Greek omlet was huge. Wife got an egg breakfast and was pleased it came w 3 eggs( we usu see these much smaller)  Great spot and reminded me of an older style diner that you'd find tucked away in other big cities.  Booths are small as prior reviewers mentioned, but this was not an issue for us as it was 2 adults and 2 kids .There are counter seating as well.  Great small, old school diner and I would definitely return when in town."}
{"text":"They raised their price multiple times within a year. I do love their \"mom and pop\" feel, but its starting to get pricey. Also, they tend to ask if you want extras/coffee without mentioning the extra cost."}
{"text":"The Avenue Open Kitchen stares at me through my office window everyday and it is hard to resist it's pull.   While it might not be the best diner in town (I miss the Stem as well) it is consistent if nothing else. You know what you're going to get and what day you'll be getting it. If you're really lucky they might change things up and throw in something odd like Jerk Chicken day, but most days it's short ribs, perogies, mac n' cheese, shepards pie or chicken fingers and poutine.   I will say this, they make a good burger but you might have to ask them two or three times if want anything fancy like a tomato or mustard. Their soups are also really really good with lentil being my favourite.   There is seating for about twelve people in the booths and another ten or so at the counter and rear table so your best bet is to order and get out if you're looking for any kind of elbow room.   Price wise they are hard to beat. You can get a large lunch for as little as $5 if you don't order a drink."}
{"text":"As an Aussie, the diner experience is a real winner. We ate here 2 days in a row. One day we took home the special for dinner that day. I don't understand why businesses don't recognise that good food and service is what people come back for time and again. Give the chains a miss get into this joint!"}
{"text":"I have went there a few times and was never disappointed. The servings are awesome and staff friendly except the cook looks kind of grouchy. The turkey dinner they serve is just like home. It does suck they are not open in the evening but they do open really early. So if you are in the Camden street neighborhood check it out."}
{"text":"Pros: Historical aspect, authentic Canadian cuisine Cons: No healthy options; Most meals are fried or have a lot of carbs, and they come with fries or soup (no salad option). I chose the soup and it was extremely salty.  Price: Reasonable for dining"}
{"text":"Went back for lunch.  Orderd the cheeseburger  ($4.75) previously frozen 6oz patty, toasted bun, grilled but mostly raw onions, tomato and my favorite cheese for a burger (though it took me a minute to come around) American cheese.    Good overall taste with tax and tip $6.50.  If I'd wanted fries they'd have been another $2.95.  Worth the snow jog over there from my office over lunch (15 minutes) not worth the two slip&falls I took on the snow-stumble back (20 minutes plus bruising.)    Other lunch specials: hot smoked meat/pastrami/roast beef freshly shaved & piled high on rye with a generous bowl if homemade soup ($8.50), braised shortribs/mashed/peas ($10.50), BLT ($4.95), Poutine ($3.95), giant chefs salad ($6.95)  This place is really known for its sandwiches, homemade soups and huge lunch specials.  The food is all made in-house and really tastes good and whole - not a lot added or taken away.  Heavy and big portions for sure, but satisfying and inexpensive and it won't leave you feeling off (like McDonalds, which admittedly I also like.)"}
{"text":"Please be advised they take cash only.  We enjoyed their poutine, Montreal smoked meat sandwich, Black Forest ham and cheese sandwich, and beef barley soup.  The apple pie was not so great."}
{"text":"Love this place. Reliable, good service, great bacon and eggs. Wish they were open more often."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great prices and atmosphere.  Check out the daily specials. Mac and cheese on Friday is really good."}
{"text":"The cook's misery from a long rough life made my eggs taste...earned. Everyone who works here had to swim to Canada from Northern Europe. There are no smiles, as the horrors of their conditions which drove them to this run down shoebox still haunt their waking thoughts.  This is the best greasy spoon in the city. 5 star all day"}
{"text":"Love this little joint. A little mama's papas diner, a perfect little hideaway in the middle of the city to come have an awesome breakfast, a home made yummy sandwich, and/or a salad. You'll definitely get your money's worth here and the staff is super nice."}
{"text":"Standard breakfast fare. Service leaves much to be desired but that's not a big deal. Nothing too spectacular."}
{"text":"We don't visit Toronto often, but when we do we always want to try something new and this little hidden gem was a great find for brunch.  We showed up right before the lunch rush, so we were very lucky to be able to get a booth and order our food first.  Service was fast, our food tasted great, and the portions were big! I had a garden salad and the smoked meat sandwich on rye, which I personally think measured up to the greats of Montreal and that's not easy to find in the GTA.  He had a omelette and  home fries.  I got a taste of his food and I thought that was great too! We definitely have plans to make this place an exception and visit again to try more."}
{"text":"Went to this place before going to tour steam whistle brewery. Was extremely crowded but found seats at the end of the bar area right in front of the cook--ended up being the best seats in the house! We got to watch him cook the amazing food!! Not only was the food good but the staff was extremely nice as well. Great food for an even better price!! I would DEF recommend!   I got the western omelette with hash browns and toast  My boyfriend got the ham, scrambled eggs and toast. Both of us left out saying \"that was great!\""}
{"text":"Great little diner in a big city. Old school offerings and the best breakfast in town. Portions that will have you walking a little slower when you leave but totally worth it."}
{"text":"4.5 stars We first visited the AOK on our \"Spoon Tour\" in June 2010. I forgot to review it at the time, but remember being slightly underwhelmed. However, after visiting over 100 breakfast places in search of great \"greasy spoon breakfasts\" (see my Yelp lists or my blog), I can say that this place stands out for authenticity and food.  The three of us had (3) eggs, either over easy or sunny side up, and they were prepared nearly perfectly. The home fries were chunky, crisp and neither over- nor under-cooked, and I'm told the bacon was just crisp enough, and tasty. The coffee was average diner fare, but at 1.05, including 1 free refill, fairly priced.  What really sets this place apart is the authenticity. Preparation and service was handled by 3 men, and I was told by one of them (an owner?) that they had been running it for 30 years, but that it had been there since the 50's. A half a dozen booths fit 4 people each, while 6-8 stools at the counter complete the seating. The grill, fryer and all the prep tools are in full view. It's an \"open kitchen\", after all!  They serve home made rice pudding, and on our way out we saw a huge pan of freshly made macaroni and cheese, browned on top. Mmmmm. Time for a lunch run?"}
{"text":"Had a great classic breakfast for a fair price, in a traditional american diner atmosphere.  Would go again anytime!"}
{"text":"I was totally surprised when I ate here for breakfast and the food was mediocre at best. I had expected so much more after reading the reviews on here.  The bathroom was up two long flights of stairs. We ordered two omelettes and neither were up to par. I ordered one without tomatoes and it came with them. The greek omelette came without any feta in it as well. The chefs were preparing for the day and they placed a plate full of raw chicken skewers right on the counter in front of us - disgusting and totally unsanitary. Wish the previous reviews reflected my experience so I wouldn't have even stepped into the place."}
{"text":"Small breakfast diner which serve amazing food for very reasonable price.  You know this place is good when a lot of regulars are there.  The lady serving us was having a rought day which made our visit a little rough but other than that the food is amazing and quick.  I got the greek omlette and my partner got the smoked meat sandwich, the coffee is freshly grind and brewed."}
{"text":"Classical deli sandwiches with a ton of meat between two thin slices of rye bread.  Absolutely delicious simple formula and these guys do it really really well.  The Mac and Cheese (Fridays only) is the best Mac and Cheese I have ever had in my life.  It's like the macaroni and the cheese blend together into one greasy delicious entity.  If I'm disciplined, I can split it over several meals (or I could just finish it in one go.  actually that sounds a lot better).  I've heard great things about their chicken fingers, but I haven't had a chance to try them yet.  Sandwiches are higher priority!  Minus points for: - cash only - short assortment of premium sandwiches: pastrami, smoked meat, roast beef - mac and cheese being only once a week - extremely limited hours.  I don't work in the area so their weekdays til 4 is extremely problematic - that one grumpy waitress (the guys who work there though are super-friendly and helpful)  So good all those shortfalls can only bring it down to 4-stars."}
{"text":"Food is awsome..big servings.mac and cheese on Fridays..wish you could get bacon in stead of salad..but always good..place is small and only breakfast and lunch"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for greasy spoons. Fortunately for me, the Avenue Open Kitchen is right around the corner from where I work. Unfortunately for me, I can't resist the poutine and the grilled cheese and therefore, I have to spend extra time at the gym to balance it out.  The people who work there are just as authentic as the old fashioned diner experience itself. The old diner counter, the historic news paper clippings on the wall, and the chef hats the cooks wear, all help blend this amazing diner into something completely unique.  The Poutine is made with real cheese curds and the gravy you could drink with a straw (maybe a gross visual but I am ok with that.. don't judge!) I am yet to have the Smoked Meat but everyone who has it says it be best Montreal smoked meat outside of Montreal!  Their daily special could have you coming back every day.   If you want to go there for dinner however, don't bother, they are only open until 5pm so make sure to go there on your way home from work to avoid disappointment!"}
{"text":"Ok I haven't reviewed in awhile and it says something when I had to write something right away for this place. This is such a hidden gem downtown. It is a great bang for your buck which is definitely hard to find downtown for breakfast or brunch. The portions are massive and you will leave feeling bloated yet satisfied. The sausage and eggs left me feeling full and happy. I love the hot sauce they offer as well for the eggs which paired amazing with the sausage. It gets hectic and busy in here so it is hard to find a seat but if your lucky to it is well worth the wait. You can also order ahead if you want to avoid the busy diner scene. But the loud atmosphere and craziness is a part of gives this place its charm."}
{"text":"Sometimes at work I go here for a cheap lunch.  That is the beginning and end of my relationship with this establishment but oh god how I wish it could be so very much more.  I long for the soft, gentle embrace of your pemeal sandwich, open avenue kitchen"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy Greasy spoon. Classic Old diner.  I had steak and eggs.  The steak was cooked how I asked ( medium rare), but was tough and hard to cut.  The service was good.  I still won't go back."}
{"text":"The Greek omelette was delicious!! Filled with peppers, olives and feta cheese! I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"The sign is old fashioned and decor is old fashioned and so is their pride in making quality good. On a chilly day, stopped by for a soup and sandwich for lunch. What could have been a generic and pre made meal was clearly made with love. Chicken noodle soup - think noodles, fresh broth, chunks of chicken. And a BLT with generous, crispy bacon.   They have several in-house smoked meats that will make your mouth water. That's what I'm going to pick up next time...."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon diner it definitely is. This place is only open weekdays from 7am-4pm, basically when I'm at work, so I didn't get a chance to try it until I decided to take a day off recently. They have a variety of diner style food like sandwiches, burgers and breakfast. I grabbed a chicken souvlaki in pita with fries for takeout which came to $10, it's less if you just get the chicken souvlaki. The chicken was quite good and portions were decent too.   It's a small space with a few booths that would seat 4-5 people each plus a couple seats along the counter. Not the best for larger groups but takeout is pretty quick. Hoping to stop by for breakfast next."}
{"text":"Let's be clear right from the start: You have to be a fan of old-school greasy spoon restaurants to get this. I had the eggs and peameal breakfast and almost didn't finish it because they give you three eggs and the peameal is 3/4 inch thick. The homefries are cut right on the grill while they cook them. Seating for only 2 dozen people, half at booths and half on stools at the counter. Cash only."}
{"text":"The coffee is thick and delicious.  The girlfriend and I were looking for a tasty greasy spoon after a late night out.  They really hit the spot. I had the Dutch Omelet with wheat toast and it completely melted the previous night away.  The girlfriends eggs and bacon were cooked to perfection.  It is obvious they scratch cook all of it because they peel the potatoes in front of you.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Oh my stars!  Finally a place with REAL cheese curds that SQUEAK!!!!  This poutine was so awesome...thick cut fries, delicious, light gravy, and real curds.  With a canned pop...only 5 bucks! The rest of my group also loved their food...roast turkey dinner, salads, pirogies, and of course....more poutine!  Will definitely be back here to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Authentic diner experience! Great hearty burgers and all day breakfast. Small place so I use Ritual to pick up. Friendly and efficient staff."}
{"text":"It's nice to go somewhere that has stayed the course through the massive gentrification that has happened in and around Queen West's old fashion district.  The food is what you would expect for a greasy spoon. It's the environment that makes such a great difference. There's a sense of triumph that I feel whenever I turn down Camden street to see that the Avenue Open Kitchen is still open and kicking. The staff are always friendly, and if you've been there fairly regularly over the years, they usually remember how you like your sandwich made."}
{"text":"This is not just a diner, it is THE diner. The standards for diners are all based off of this spot. Friendly, down to earth service, and a classic peameal bacon dish I will get every time I visit."}
{"text":"There's something so refreshing about having a classic diner meal in the middle of downtown Toronto. Avenue Open Kitchen isn't full of frills but is full of flavour and characters. Great service, filled with locals and regulars, and great atmosphere.   If you're looking for great food, great prices, and an authentic breakfast - screw your fancy brunch, come here."}
{"text":"Nice place for a homestyle breakfast. I'm pretty sure the veteran cooks have flipped about 3 million eggs each. I order the omelette every time."}
{"text":"\"Avenue Open Kitchen is a clean vintage diner, but calling it just that does not do it justice.\" \"To top off the experience, we ordered their Rice Pudding. What a delight! Milky, tender, smooth - it was served with a container of cinnamon on the side (for those of us picky about what is the ideal amount). \"  \"It has soul given to it by a Macedonian family from Greece who opened it thirty four years ago.\"  Just a few bites of our full experience!"}
{"text":"Five star greasy spoon for sure.   Good food Daily specials Cheap prices Fast service Nice vibe  Really can't say a bad word about it!"}
{"text":"had grease spoon brunch, was perfectly greasy, perfectly salty and perfectly cozy.. eggs and bacon, simple yet wonderful..  i saw the other food people have been ordering, onion rings, roast beenf sandwich and shepards pie...can't wait to go back for lunch.!  NOTE, cash only"}
{"text":"Avenue Open Kitchen, Toronto on Camden Street Of of Spedina --   Do not be turned off by your initial impression; this is an ancient diner with a counter and stools and booths - it's not retro, it's real! Wonderful staff, they cook what you want the way you want it, classic flat top grill burgers - my husband was thrilled they put a slice of ham in his grilled cheese and cooked it exactly how he said. He was ecstatic that they cook the burgers on the flat top with the buns right next to them so the buns get just that right but of juice from the meat on them as they brown.   They were genuinely happy at our compliments and that they had pleased us! In an era of \"there's always another customer\", this treatment made us real fans!!   This really great, tiny mom and pop restaurant, has been run by the family for decades - a steak sandwich is just that ... a steak on a bun (not that thin sliced stuff) cooked perfectly with steak sauce condiment; chicken soup like my grandma used to make (you know when the chicken is real and that little bit of chicken fat floating on top that makes the broth so rich and flavorful....and great onion rings! Looks like a dive, tastes like heaven and happy memories of what real cooking is all about!!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Everything you would expect from the local neighborhood diner."}
{"text":"It's 7am and my glasses are a foggy frenzy when my nose first catches a whiff of the griddle. It's 7:05 and I've made my way to the back table, and ordered sausage and eggs \"over.\" Not over easy, just over, as my ball-capped wearing, grampy aged server classified it. It's 7:10 when an oval plate lands on my table: 4 links, 2 big eggs and hashbrowns. Brown toast and a packet of jam on the side.   By 7:11 am, I feel at home. Stuffing myself with greasy-in-a-good-way sausage, gloriously runny eggs, ketchup-y taters, drinking my coffee, free with breakfast before 11am. It may have been because of the jetlag, it may have been because it was my first taste of Canadian food after two weeks in a foreign land, it may just have been because it all tasted so damn good.   It's only when I had command enough of my senses that I took in my surroundings. Two older gents un-ironically discussing moose knuckles, a shuffling, yet hustling kitchen staff who likely have tales of similar mornings dating back decades prepping for lunch and a small assortment of other diners, looking like they share similar tales of decades gone by. By 7:15am, I'm lost in the nostalgia of it all.   I dedicate this review to the memory of my own papa. I think he would have applauded them for their sausage too."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great service.  I want to take this place home with me!     We wandered in here on a Saturday morning and ordered some basic breakfast - eggs, bacon, home fries, toast for me...and an omelet for the boyfriend.  Both were well prepared and tasty.   As the cook went about methodically assembling our breakfasts, another man was there hand peeling potatoes with a knife and par cooking bacon.   I liked that I could see everything being cooked/prepped and that the place had a very friendly feel to it.  We would have gone back the next day, but they are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"It is hard not to love a diner like this. Toronto, once an industrial city to the core, used to be peppered with just this sort of spots. The hollowing out of the city core, followed by the rise of creative and financial workforce, has all about disappeared such greasy spoons from the map.   The food here is delicious and affordable, the service is friendly and welcoming, and most of all: the coffee is damn good. Daily special are listed on the wall.   Be sure to check out the poutine. It is damn delicious."}
{"text":"Don't let the out the door lines scare you; most of these customers are buying meals for take out. Their dishes are cheap, and the servings are generous! The quality of the food (my fave is breakfast) does not disappoint. The resto itself small (which also explains the line outside) yet cozy, and gives off an old school vibe (if the resto was any bigger, all they'd be missing are roller skating waitresses). You can tell from the interior, decor, and close-knit staff that this business has been through generations. I love the fact that the staff are allllways smiling and interested in making small conversation. Definitely bringing my friends to check out this gold mine!"}
{"text":"Avenue Open Kitchen is a neighbourhood classic.  I loved coming here regularly when I worked in the area, and I truly miss it now that I'm farther away.  I have found memories of lining up in that cramped doorway for greasy awesomeness.  This is a greasy spoon in the truest sense of the word.  No nonsense, no pretense, just quality food at a quality price.  The portion sizes are enormous, so bring your appetite.  Be advised that it's cash only.  There are some regular everyday dishes available here, including montreal smoked meat or pastrami sandwiches that are simply amazing.    There are also rotating daily specials.  Some of my favourites include: - Shepherd's Pie - Beef Short Rips - Chicken Fingers and Poutine - Roast Turkey Dinner - Mac & Cheese  This is definitely a must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Wonderful old school diner. Cozy small space where you can watch your meal being prepped on the flat top. Went on a Friday for a late breakfast and was taken to a table, and offered water and a cup of coffee immediately. The menu is easy to navigate and ranges from omelettes, burgers, deli sandwiches, poutine and dinner platters. I decided on a bacon, green pepper and onion omelette. It comes with a side of home fries and toast and was SO DELICIOUS! The prices are very affordable and the portions are generous. The place started to really pick up and became busy around noon, seems like it's a go to lunch spot for people in the area. The burgers and the pastrami sandwiches looked amazing! The staff was friendly and welcoming. Loved this place for its hometown charm and classic diner vibe."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype with this place.  The food was decent and the price fair but I'm docking off stars for the poor service I experienced.  To start, there were no tables when we arrived around 12:30pm on a Saturday which was expected but there was also no greeting or acknowledgement that we were there waiting for at least 10 mins.  The tables were dirty and sticky when we were invited to sit down, when water was brought to our table, the server split it all over the table and had to clean it up ourselves. Two coffees were charged when only one coffee was ordered and when we mentioned it to the server, we were still expected to pay for two. The bill is also hand written and calculated and the actual amount when the server tallied it up on the register turned out to be different from what was on the bill. The worst part is the sneaky menu for breakfast, there's an additional $1 charge for breakfast after 11am written in fine print. I don't mind paying $2 more dollars but I don't appreciate surprise amounts on bills.  The meal turned out to be around $30 including tax and tips for two omelettes which is not cheap either to justify the poor service.  A lot of things went wrong and it was not a pleasant experience to kick off the weekend."}
{"text":"Truly a gem in the King/Spadina area. I came here for some take-out brunch on a Thursday and ordered the eggs/bacon/home fries. The food was exactly what you would want from a late breakfast/brunch - oily, hearty and savory. As a plus, the diner is also cheap and family-run.   My only complaint is the limited hours - Avenue Open is ironically, not open on weekends when I would have needed it the most! In terms of seating, there is a long bar for larger groups and only 3 booths.   I regret not finding this diner sooner, but will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Lovely little joint within walking distance from work.. this place was small and spaces were tight. The booths would not fit 4 people unless you were all skinny like sticks...Lol..nonetheless the food was amazingly good.  Size, portion everything well balanced..they didn't go cheap on anything...which way too many restaurants do nowadays...   It's more or less like a fast food joint owned by an the previous generation...the chicken kebobs were juicy and flavourful, salads were fresh with more than adequate pieces of chicken, burgers were juicy and delicious...the prices are very reasonable!  It's becoming a mission to find places that provide above average quality and quantity. Overheard, that this place is being secretly taken over....hmm... hope that's not the case becuz if it is...the quality and quantity will be at risk...   This is the place for lunch and it's always packed...when you see a line going in such a small restaurant, you've gotta eat here!   Definitely coming back without doubts..."}
{"text":"Those of us who are lunch regulars at the Avenue Open Kitchen just refer to the place as the A OK.   This place is like stepping back in to the past with its tiny little booths, its narrow counters and its big old steam table right in the front window.  During the winter months you can't even see inside of it from the street because of the condensation from the cooking.  I keep expecting to bump into Ralph Kramden and Ed Norton in this place.  I've seen more butt crack  hunched over the counter chowing down on monster portions of Mac & Cheese than I care to remember.  The A OK is a straight up homage to the original concept of the small local diner/greasy spoon.    It is pure and simple food. Blue plate specials.  Brisket.  Mac & Cheese.  Basic comfort with a basic price tag.  I absolutely live to eat my corned beef sandwiches at the A OK.  My girlie pal who works on Camden will often meet me for lunch.  We'll have a couple of corned beef sandwiches, share a plate of fries, wash it down with some ice tea and it doesn't cost us more then $15 bucks, taxes and tip in.    Camden St. runs between Spadina & Brant, just south of Richmond.  It's a one wayer, from east to west and can be a pain in the ass to get in to but worth the effort."}
{"text":"Sorry, but I didn't really get why this place has 4,5 stars on yelp. Yeah, it has classic diner atmosphere, but that's the only thing that I can point. The food was just okay, I had steak and eggs breakfast: eggs were fine (what could you expect?), but the steak was fat and low quality. Don't waste your time going there from far away, a decent place to have a quick meal."}
{"text":"If your looking for a long gem around the area, this is definitely the place to go. You can order ahead so you don't have to be crowded while you wait. Space is tight inside, and only a few tables for dining in. There are also some single seaters along the kitchen too. They have 5 or 6 people working esp during rush hours, so basically you don't have to wait for food. Prices they charge for the amount of food you get is a sure win. They're famous short ribs are special on Thursdays and is something you should definitely get. Good food, great prices!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I've been too. Very welcoming place to be and reminds me of downtown Montreal. Especially when you order their smoked meat sandwiches. The best thing there is definitely their potatoes!!! Tooo good"}
{"text":"Every once in awhile a place arises out of nowhere because someone points it out. I love that. Kinda goes to show how much neighborhoods supports their gems.  This place certainly is one. A greasy spoon with tons of pictures from way back when that let's you know the folks behind the counter have and will always be here.  The place is crazy busy during the lunch rush so very happy to have a seat in the booths but I would have been just as happy eating at one of the lunch counter stools.  It's fast, cheap and charming. Genuine vintage everywhere.    One of the crazy things is the bathroom. You go upstairs instead of down. I dig it."}
{"text":"Greasy breakfast joint with an amazing cheap menu comparative to other greasy spoon kitchens around the city. Had the Peameal Bacon served with 3 eggs, Home Fries, Toast and a Coffee for $7.95. The Peameal bacon was thick and cooked perfectly. Eggs were fresh and delicious. Service is excellent. Quaint little no frills diner. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I truly am a fan of this place. They are a small family run business but Gosh they are soooooo busy all the time. I always think how do they manage all the rush they get. It's steps away from my office and so far my favourite lunch spot in the area.  I have tried so many dishes from their menu and all the dishes are soooooo good!! I have tried their challah french toast, chicken salad sandwich, tuna salad sandwich, roast beef sandwich, montreal meat sandwich, clubhouse sandwich, fish & chips, hot chicken plate, hot beef plate, greek salad with chicken souvlaki, steak on bun with fries and soup, chicken souvlaki pita and fries, chicken fingers and fries, chicken breast on kaiser, gyros on pita. Yes, so pretty much I've had all their menu and I love it. Don't judge me, I am a foodie and all their dishes are soooooooo yummmm and I can't just enough of it.  If you are in Toronto do come and visit this place and you won't regret it a bit. This can become your favourite breakfast or lunch spot, it's a very deserving candidate ;)"}
{"text":"Love this place! So delicious and such a good value. Only improvement I would suggest is adding more vegetarian options to the lunch menu. Otherwise 5 stars! Go there for excellent service and a delicious breakfast :)"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday, feeling under the weather and craving comfort food. Even though it was close to lunch time, I had a goal in mind: eggs and bacon, with brown toast on the side.   The restaurant is small; I was one of two people who ate in though it's not to say that it wasn't busy. A line had formed outside with people who waited patiently in the cold but the staff's quick service didn't keep them waiting for long.   Four middle-aged men worked hard at the fryers churning out orders of what seemed to be the popular items of the day: fish and chips, poutine, Caesar salad. I glanced over at the menu list on the wall and the prices are cheap. I didn't see a thing that was over $10.  I'll definitely return here. Both my wallet and belly will thank me."}
{"text":"This place has your old school greasy spoon feel. The service is a little weird and not exactly up to Toronto standards, but the food is fast and fresh!   The peameal bacon breakfast is good (nice thick pieces of peameal), the potatoes are delicious! The eggs are eggs and the toast is toast.   My friend said the omelet was underwhelming with the cheese not actually being melted in, but folder into a hot omelet.   The lunch/dinner pieces looked delicious (some kind of club sandwich, the steak and eggs and the poutine).   Good cheap eats! Excellent for students and the morning after long nights."}
{"text":"Great diner in downtown Toronto.  No frills for breakfast - the omelette was perfectly cooked and the hash browns were really delicious.  Thick cut peameal bacon was tasty too.  There are no healthy options, but this breakfast is worth the extra gym time."}
{"text":"Great spot, for a quick bite. The kind of space that makes you forget your in the middle of a big city. Food is awesome. However, I do have one recommendation. The place would be a lot better if they had some music playing to give it a better ambiance."}
{"text":"A very small little bussines and a good place to find Aa great first lunch in Canada, Montreal beef with poutin It was delicious."}
{"text":"Tiny little dive of a place, not much for seating, but we managed to get a table, and within a few minutes of our being taken, full breakfast arrived. Was so impressed by the speed. Pricing was great, it was exactly what I was looking for in a breakfast/brunch location."}
{"text":"A hole is the wall but the food was good as was the service. Nothing fancy here just good at what they do! I had the Greek fries just to taste them - too much for one person to eat! I upscaled to the Greek side salad -  I had the chicken pita and it was very flavorful! My guys had the pastrami said it was good not great and ask for your bread to be toasted. Check your bill too because I chose to ignore the mistake in mine and only Looked carefully Because the people leaving before us asked for it to be refigured. It was good - fast - reasonable - flavorful food"}
{"text":"Downtown with my husband and wanted all day breakfast or brunch place so went to my trusty Yelp app and found this place. It's another one of those small hole in the wall places that's been around for 50 years. The owner and waitress were pleasant and the food came quickly. Everything is freshly made. You can even see the guy in the back peeling the potatoes for the home fries. The home fries are nicely seasoned. I had that with the Avenue Breakfast Clubhouse, (it has strip bacon wrapped in egg, lettuce, tomato and a thick piece of peameal bacon). It was large enough that I probably should have shared it with my husband. He ordered the Montreal smoked meat sandwich and a side of onion rings. Their smoked meat is so moist and tasty. The onion rings were super crunchy. Overall, a very pleasant experience with delicious food. He great thing about this place is that it's really close to my husband's work, he can come back anytime for lunch or breakfast. You can even order using the Ritual app."}
{"text":"Loved this downtown lunch place.. Felt myself like in an old diner from a movie. had bacon burger with fries..burger was great, the bacon even better(and you get a few pieces)  fries perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Also had breakfast stake and eggs.. The only downside was home fries, should have asked to substitute. Try to go a bit before lunch rush to get a table. Or you can just pick up your meal :)"}
{"text":"Don't judge by the appearance. For 5 bucks you can take-out every kind of food (I had a giant caesar salad, supposed to be \"small\", while friends had from perogies to poutine) and a can of pop.   My salad was very good and probably was made with one entire lettuce. Friends were very happy with their choices also. A good tip: don't eat inside (dark and packed), order take-out, there's a nice park close enough and during spring/summer you can have a quick lunch picnic with your friends there!   I should go back and have poutine on the park! Theirs looks amazing!"}
{"text":"As far as open kitchen diners go, this is tops in my books! Authentic, family run greasy spoon with huge portions, cheap prices and those adorable low seating rolly bar stools and vinyl benches make this diner a treat. It's got all the charm of a show I watched as a kid - \"Alice\" - where you feel at home and welcomed every time you enter this smell filled steamy little diner.   Daily specials like mac and cheese, roast beef or turkey dinner with all the fixings, great club sandwich and westerns, grilled cheese, fries, a decent (although frozen-deep-fried) fish and chips, freshly shorn reuben or pastrami sandwiches - enough to give anyone a heart attack that asks for it!   A frequent (a-hem, sleepy/tired/hungover) lunch spot for my co-workers and I as well as a great all day breakfast spot - they serve the business crowd and closed the odd time for a family vacation - well deserved! during the week.   Mmmm...grilled cheese on brown with fries and a coleslaw...I'm salivating just thinking about it.   NOTE: CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"Fantastic greasy eats with sizable portions at cheap prices.  It's not going to be the best and definitely not the healthiest, but Avenue Open Kitchen is a diner. And it's a very legitimate diner at that. Service is slow, but the staff are more than familiar and definitely quite friendly. Seating is limited, bar seating and a few booths and small tables.  The mac and cheese Friday specials are good! They have a special each day of the week and they all sound wonderful, but I only had the chance to try Friday's. I did find it oily (what'd you expect!) but it also did come with 'chef's salad' (sorta makes up for it) for $8.50 + HST. I do like mac and cheese, but I don't think it's fantastic.... just decent. However, I'm quite satisfied with the value I get here.  The chicken souvlaki on a pita was tasty, with a good amount of tzaziki making it a creamy and satisfying lunch. The pita was a decent size and it came at a cheap price too ($5.50).  I'd come back again."}
{"text":"As far as affordable brunches places go downtown this diner is as good as they come. I got a Greek omelette and it was absolutely delicious. The staff was very kind, friendly and attentive. I would have also tried their well-known poutine as well but its made with beef gravy which is a food restriction for me.  The decor is very simple and there is not a whole lot of seating so this place isn't ideal for large groups. Overall this place was great, and I will for sure be coming back."}
{"text":"Such an adorable deli with the sweetest staff. Loved watching the cooks bring cooked meat from the kitchen to the front of the restaurant to slice on an old style deli machine by the window. Free smells!  I had my first peameal bacon experience here and boy did it satisfy. The peameal dish came with 3 eggs, 2 toasts and superbly seasoned homefries all for less than $10. It was hearty and filling and just what I needed for a days worth of energy. Great breakfast, great value. I'd definitely frequent this little gem."}
{"text":"This place is such a go to for me that I take it for granted. So much so that I've completely forgotten to review it until now. I've pretty much been coming here sporadically over the last 3 years but now almost every week.   Avenue is just solid and consistent and, believe it or not, reasonably priced for an eatery smack in the middle of the king to queen overpriced lunch zone. You can actually have a sandwich AND soup or fries for under $10 instead of paying $13+ for a burger with a side of diddly squat with a fat 20% tip expected for a whole lot of nothing.   The peameal bacon is a bit nuts though. Half an inch thick and greasy as hell but you can't say they don't hook you up, even if I like my peameal thinner, like at insomnia.   The navy bean soup is awesome and straight up like your dad telling you to \"listen when I'm talkin' to you, son!\" Have it with a pastrami sandwich and scud missile amounts of mustard.   If you're dining alone, sit at the bar like a mensch. Don't take up a booth because you'd rather be at Weslodge nibbling on fennel and wondering why the waiters wear gun holsters."}
{"text":"Thank you to the wonderful lady who served me on my birthday, yesterday. You made my birthday super special with the rice pudding. Also had a great grilled cheese which made me feel like a kid again :)  Seems like they have a lot of regulars. A true neighbourhood diner experience in the heart of Toronto!  Edit: Stopped by again in Dec/Jan and the nice lady remembered me and what I ordered! Amazing service!"}
{"text":"The kind of sandwiches with the meat overflowing off of the bread or bun, and make you say to yourself \"how the hell am I going to get my mouth around that???\" breakfast or lunch ... this place is sensational. I think these old dudes that run it have served up 1,000,000s of eggs and sandwiches and poutine and down home cooking in their past 60 years they've been doing this.  This place is perfect."}
{"text":"They redid the place a few months ago. Some of the old owners/employees have left. The food is still pretty good but it's lost some of its charm. Everything is too shiny and the grill is too clean."}
{"text":"If you hail from Brooklyn or Shoreditch then this place is definitely for you. I'm guessing the owner's are Jewish, given the menu's leaning toward smoked meat, but there's something for everyone here, that is anyone who yearns for that authentic greasy spoon feel (think bacon and egg butties with under done egg yolk leaking out the sides like flavour filled lava) From bottomless coffee to a waitress with a cute smile and personality to boot, you won't be disappointed with the quality of food and the very reasonable bill.  The atmosphere is intimate in a speak-easy kind of way. Great for bonding with co-workers or business colleagues."}
{"text":"They gave my takeout order to someone else named Alan, because his name is somehow similar to mine. I waited for them to make another one for me. They forgot to make it, so about 25 minutes later they realized they still haven't started on my sandwich. Took about 35 minutes for my second takeout order to get made."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations are too high, but I expect people who handle my food to do so in a sanitary manner. The last time I ordered a sandwich here, I watched the man at the front handle cash, slice meat, and make a sandwich without putting on gloves or washing his hands. No thanks, never again!  The first time I ordered here it was for beef stew, which comes with buttered bread, corn, and mashed potatoes. Definitely too much for me to eat during lunch. The food was pretty good.  There are a few seats inside, so expect to order to go. This place only accepts cash."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall authentic diner. Name makes sense because you can literally see what they are cooking right in front of you if you sit at the bar.   Came on a hungover Saturday morning looking for a no fuss meal without a horrendous wait in line, and was satisfied. At 10:30, there were a handful of available seats inside. We didn't have the best server (no water refill, didn't seat us or give us a menu) but for the price and zero wait time it was still good.   I ordered the bacon and eggs (comes with home fries and white, whole grain, or rye toast), and my boyfriend had the french toast (which was good) and an orange juice. The juice was in the bottle and not poured into a glass.   Their omelets looked really good, if I come back next time I want to try those!"}
