{"text":"I haven't actually stayed in this impressively furnished hotel, but was lucky enough to enjoy a meal there today.  An all around very pleasant experience.  I figured that while in Ohio, I might as well try the Ohio Burger, which did not disappoint--all of the meals at my table looked fairly appetizing.  I regret that I did not catch our waitress' name, as she was so personable and willing to help my party with whatever she could that I was compelled to give her a shout out here--you've done Sheraton proud, lady!"}
{"text":"New hotel in Cleveland - I stayed there on Saturday night 6-14-2014. My overall experience was a 5 out of 10. (10 being excellent) The club room is not worth the extra money there is bowl of nuts and a few crackers."}
{"text":"We had a family reunion dinner here, and the catering was just great.  Food was good. Service was good.  Only downside was that I needed to use the ATM and they charge $3.25 to get my money.  I little hefty."}
