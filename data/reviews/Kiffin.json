{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to Kiffins for the first time last week. We met the lovely young couple that own it and they shared their passion for creating great, accessible, local and sustainable food. They arrived from San Francisco, Ca., where realestate prices are choking out creativity and accessibility...and moved to Montreal to realize this dream. As a Montrealer myself, I must say, I was delighted to see how much love they put into restoring the beautiful historic space they are in....Montreal is full of treasures, buried under too much paint and alterations...this couple took the time to reveal and honor this space and breath life back into it's stunning architecture and fill it with the aromas of great food and coffee....I wish these two the best of luck and hope anyone reading this will stop in when in Montreal."}
{"text":"A lovely space on St. Denis to grab a coffee and quick bite. The menu is very reasonably priced with everything under ten dollars, and there are rotating specials along with a fixed menu that is all worth trying. Definitely a great place to hit up while on the go or to spend some time reading or studying!"}
{"text":"Incredibly good coffee and scones!!! Probably the best scones I've ever eaten in my life - soft, buttery and warm.

Kiffin features a rotating menu and I had the opportunity of trying the chef recommended Warm Quinoa Bowl. Generous portion and healthy to boot.

The ambience resembles a turn of the century apartment - warm and cozy. The owners are incredibly sweet and check on you regularly to make sure you are doing fine.

I look forward to going back to Kiffin to check out the chef's latest creations."}
{"text":"We tried out Kiffin Lunch last week. We we're amazed to be brought chicken Tonkatsu in reusable bento boxes. The entire experience had a special flavour to it that made us connect with the food and the meal was heavenly!! I had been seeking a good Tonkatsu ever since coming back from Japan and I finally got it :D
Thank you Kiffin, looking forward to trying out the tacos!"}
{"text":"Ww came here for breakfast while visiting Montreal. We came a few minutes before they opened, but we're offered tea and a scone while we waited. My husband got the Japanese omelet,  and I got the stuffed sweet potato with a 63 degree egg and smokes bacon. Everything was delicious and flavorful. The decor was cozy, refined, and beautiful. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"5+++

The proprietor said, \"You'll eat it and be like yum, yum, yum. Soooo goood.\" And he was right.

I ordered miso with ramen. It had wakame and mushrooms with just the right amount of spicy. Very, very tasty.

In addition to the soup, I ordered hot water with fresh ginger, mint leaves, and lime. Probably my new go-to caffeine-free hot beverage from now on.

I took a scone to go and it had rose frosting and it was divine.

Beyond the food, the ambiance made me feel cozy and at ease. If I could change one thing, it'd be the seating. I'm not a stool fan and prefer comfy seats."}
{"text":"Mon lunch a embelli ma journée!
J'ai été chez Kiffin pour prendre ma commande à emporter et tout s'est très bien passé. Le personnel est très sympathique, le cadre est joli (ils organisent également des cours de cuisine), les plats sont pour la plupart autour de 10$ et surtout, tout a l'air délicieux :  leur site internet permet de commander depuis la maison ou le bureau, les photos des plats donnent déjà toutes envie d'y goûter. Il y en a pour tous les goûts : craving de fromage, végé, gros appétit.. Pour faire changement du menu régulier, il y a aussi un plat du jour.
Ce n'est pas un endroit où l'on se dit que l'on va encore manger mal et qu'on devrait se préparer un lunch, en fait je me suis dit que mon lunch maison aurait peut-être été moins santé. Les plats proposés ont beaucoup de saveur et sont aussi très bien présentés, même à emporter! Je n'avais plus faim du tout et j'étais très satisfaite de mon repas.
Je vais y retourner pour sûr."}
{"text":"I would describe the place and atmosphere as 'casual' and the food style and presentation 'chic'.  If u are up for an adventure for ur taste buds, this is a great place to be! There are hints of Indian and African food while mixed with local Montreal styles tastes. The staff can't be any more friendlier.  I had the chance to try their 5 course Sunday brunch... feeling satisfied!  Price was in the mid-end though.. not the 1 star as it is currently indicated.  Didn't mind the price point though, since the quality of the food and service do match it! :)  To sum up, causal chic mixed with exotic culture touch. Interesting food adventure!"}
{"text":"One word: Neat! 

I came on the day where they were inviting students to come decorate the cookies and Christmas cards. The atmosphere was joyful and all the students were hard at work. I had a chance to try their vegan macaroni and cheese bowl (5$) and ginger soda drink(3$). The vegan mac n cheese was delicious and the portion was perfect! I don't usually drink ginger anything although.... The ginger soda drink is out of this world! 

I will definitely come back to have a taste of a fuller menu of this restaurant with a great cause behind it."}
{"text":"I went last night for an \"insanely spicy\" special menu. The whole experience was amazing and although some of the food wasn't exactly my taste, it was all as advertised.... insanely spicy and very well prepared. The service is extraordinary and the overall vibe is both \"too cool for school\" and comfortably homey at the same time. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"OMG it is so good! This place just opened near my office and I am so happy! I went yesterday to grab takeout for lunch and had to go back today! The food is great and caters to many dietary restrictions! It is tasty, flavorful and fresh. 

They update their menu on their facebook page as they have a special menu item every day. I have also been told that I can message them my order and pick it up a little later, something I will definitely put to good use!

Definitely worth trying out!"}
{"text":"I end up going to Kiffin every week as the big center tables are perfect for game nights (usually Friday nights in case you want to join). The food is delicious and there is enough variety to satisfy a diverse range of tastes. While it is easy on the wallet, they never compromise on the quality and it shows that they really care for their customers. Case in point - one of my vegetarian friends who is really fussy loves going there because unlike other places where the vegetarian food is just the regular food with meat removed, here the recipe is designed from the ground up keeping in mind a vegetarian palate. The proprietors are chatty and will have a whole bunch of interesting stories to exchange. Recommended dishes: Mac and cheese (with bacon), the grilled cheese (comes with rich tomato soup), and when available, you must try the eggs benedict and the ramen."}
{"text":"Our experience at Kiffin was nothing short of top-notch, if not a little surreal.

Here's the larger story: Kiffin opened six months ago after a six month renovation period. Within a week of opening, the business above them caught fire. The owners lost everything and had to rebuild. This Saturday they re-opened (to our surprise) with a special event: a five-course pyjama-themed brunch. For $30.

Walking in we had no idea what was going on. Natasha, one of the owners, greeted us like we were family (no exaggeration) and explained the special event for the reopening. While they advertised five courses, it ended up being more like seven courses (with the fruit and cheese platter and the olive/hummus plate) and we were there for THREE HOURS. That's three hours of eating and hanging out with the (incredibly warm) staff.

We accidentally spent our Saturday afternoon eating fantastic food: scones, fruit and cheese, blueberry pancakes, fried brussel sprout and bacon nests with a poached egg, sweet potato mash with candied pecans and back bacon, olives and hummus, and finally, pot pies. Did I mention it was accompanied by a glass of bubbly? They also veganized EVERYTHING for my man friend.
I have no regrets about all that food: what a day to be alive.

Dearest yelpers, please visit Kiffin. These people are down-right lovely, the food's fantastic, and they're doing everything to bounce back from a crazy situation."}
