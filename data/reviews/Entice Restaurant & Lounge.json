{"text":"I came to Entice with my boyfriend for his mom's birthday - and this place sure knows how to spoil their guests. The first drink that I had - I've never tasted anything like it - Guns and Roses - it's extravagant to see in action.. but the taste is also madness and mind blowing, I love the sexy smoky after taste. I had the perfect salmon, which just melted in my mouth. I eat it everywhere I go but this had to be the best I ever tried. I also tasted everyone's dish at my table. I heard that they found some crazy cook books worth thousands of dollars and have invested a lot into revamping their menu recently.. I could see it on my plate - each dish was special and the best recipe for the type of meal requested. From ordering like 50% of the menu our table just indulged until we hit a food coma.  We even ordered extra food to take home and ate it next day for dinner.

I'm from Los Angeles and I've tried many 5 star restaurants ... but never food that gave this much attention to detail. If this restaurant was in LA they would have a line at the door and a month worth of bookings. Their prices are average and should be raised for the quality the service and the atmosphere. 

They gave the birthday girl a desert that looks exactly like sushi but is made of all sweet mouthwatering ingredients and so we became jealous and had to order more for the table..  They also have a cool bar with counters displaying live ocean waves  to match their one of a kind drink menu. The servers are so thoughtful. This is going to be our spot each time we come to Toronto. It's brand new and has yet to be discovered by their locals."}
{"text":"About a month ago, a Enticing dish walked by my table, I stood up to follow it with my eyes, then I took a step or two so I could linger a little longer only to find myself casually walking by the table for an unassuming glance.  Catching the server's attention, I asked: \"what was the dish in your left hand,\"
\"the lamb\" she replied.
As I sat down, at my table, I declared \"we're coming back for the lamb\".  Last week was my birthday and that's just what I had.  The lamb was like trying something incredible for the first time.  With my Father's pending visit, I said \"we have to bring my Dad here for this next week\".  Well, next week happened to be Tuesday and he absolutely loved it.  His wife had the Strip Loin and was equally pleased; I had a nibble and I must admit, that's what I'm ordering next.  

I  also reordered the Calamari; the plate was so clean when we were the done you'd think they'd served us bread.

I  added the EFC (Entice Fried Chicken) as an appetizer, which they cut up for us and it was the \"tenderest\", juiciest chicken I've ever had, breading with every bite.  

I also shared in two entrees;
 1. Risotto, mushroom on every fork,
 2. Seafood Linguini, crustaceans a plenty.  

We finished the evening spooning a Sorbet and it was well loved.  

Given that I've been a frequent diner, possibly becoming a heavy user, what just occurred to me in writing this review is that the chef and owner have to be designing meals for the experience.  I'm looking forward to the steak!"}
{"text":"This review is overdue (woops). I came here for winterlicious with friends and had the pakoras, salmon, and the hot chocolate bread pudding for dinner. 

Wins: pakoras - great coconut sauce; I like that they were bite-size; good presentation. Salmon - perfectly cooked and matched well with how the daikons were flavoured.

Things to improve: hot chocolate bread pudding - it was literally cube of bread with hot chocolate poured on it...not sure what else to say, except please consider removing this from the menu!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place that can host a group of 12 people last minute in Toronto. Entice came to the rescue. It was my birthday. When we showed up to the elegant restaurant there was a birthday card at the table from Entice, signed by the staff! It was such a sweet touch. 
The music was great, the service was excellent and every dish was delicious!! I know that because I had a bite of everyone's plate! My favourites were: Korean bbq ribs*, salmon and the cheese gnocchi.

* with kimchi mmmmmm :)

Entice also has a dynamic bar where every cocktail is made with care and an artistic touch. They are named cleverly as well. I started off with the bitter-y \"A Baby without a Name\" then saw the wine list and had to have a Rioja. My friends raved about the a cocktail that came in a floral tea cup - \"All Tea All Shade\". It was pleasantly sweet.

The restaurant wasn't very busy at all on a Wednesday night. In fact we were the only table for a while until 2-3 couples rolled in later for cocktails and dinner. I would definitely come back...maybe to check out their breakfast. 

Thank you Entice!"}
{"text":"Came on a busy night recently. Had the Entice burger, which was a bit spicy, but had a great kick to it, however the burger itself was lacking some flavour. The spicy ahi tuna dish was actually my favourite, I would definitely give that a go again. The cocktails, fresh and light. The service in itself was just right, not too overbearing with the menu or up-selling, but highly knowledgeable on the suggestions. Staff, friendly; ambiance was a bit loud for my liking as I had to project my voice at a height that seemed foreign. The venue, albeit small, harbored a more intimate vibe many can enjoy with the dim-lit setting. I will say I am pleased with the bathroom refreshments, as a woman - whoever's idea that was, just know it's greatly appreciated and did not go unnoticed, so thank you! Wonderful atmosphere and supporting staff."}
{"text":"I had a completely different, much more positive experience at Entice and thus don't get all the negative reviews. Yes this restaurant is situated in Queen West around lots of \"hipster\" spots, but I didn't know that meant a homogenous monopoly for hipster ville. Chef Ryan Wilson-Lal comes with a good pedigree from the AGO and he's creating some interesting dishes.

The interior is sleek and the bar area is gorgeous; perfect spot to meet up with friends. I only tried the brunch and cannot speak for the dinner menu, but the mini waffles were one of the best brunch dishes I have ever had in the city. Surprisingly light, the juxtaposition between sweet and sour from the cherries is all you need to start your day right."}
{"text":"Entice Culinary Lounge is an upscale bistro located in Queen West. The design of the restaurant is very modern and minimalistic. They offer molecular gastronomy and provide 'fancy' serving techniques, such as pouring a jus de boeuf over a steaming hot stone prior to drizzling it over a tender Striploin steak.  The presentation of the food was gorgeous,  I ordered the sour cherry duck breast served with root vegetables and a compressed pear ($28), unfortunately however I didn't feel the quality of the meal matched the price. The Server was excellent and she offered unlimited sparkling water as they make the water in-house. Regrettably, I'm doubtful that Entice Culinary Lounge is going to survive in Queen West. The vibe of the restaurant doesn't seem to fit in with the hipster trends of that area. I wish them all the best though!"}
{"text":"Pricey, but the food was delicious!!!! And amazing service!!! I had the risotto as my main and my friend had the steak! It wasn't busy the night we went (just us and one other table). We celebrated my birthday and they brought out the most delicious chocolate dessert with sparklers in it!! Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Didn't love it, didn't hate it. We tried the Summerlicious menu this weekend and could tell that both the meals and cocktails are crafted with care and that real thought goes into the ingredients and aesthetics. However, both were missing that sort of je ne sais quoi that turns an ok meal into a great meal. Definitely A for effort as the service is fantastic and all the dishes were beautifully plated, just missing that little something."}
{"text":"The food was very mediocre. Nothing we had ordered as a large group was good enough to warrant a return visit.  The service was painfully slow, and the room was very loud. The bar surface was made up of television screens, which seems like a good idea, but it turns out it was nauseating."}
{"text":"This is a promising addition to the 'hood, but they have a lot of work to do. I visited late on a Wednesday night, and the four bored servers and one manager outnumbered the customers on the floor two to one. I ordered the sea bream which was impeccably prepared (crispy skin!) and served with a generous portion of carefully prepared greens. Unfortunately the lovely presentation was lost due to the overly dim lighting, and the bad selection of terribly cheesy (and quite loud) top 40 hip hop music almost ruined everything for me. I paired the meal with a mediocre Riesling; apparently they're \"working\" on their wine selection. In any case, I'll give this place a second try due mainly to the quality of the food, and if only to see if everything else might get any better, because there's lots of room for improvement."}
{"text":"Where to even start about this sad excuse for a \"restaurant\".  One of the servers told us that the only reason this place is still open is because the owner's parents finance it, and the majority of customers they do get are friends of the owners and half their bills are covered.  There are numerous spelling mistakes on all three menus, which is incredibly embarrassing.  I even noticed they misspelled the name of their own restaurant on the bathroom mirror (it said #EnitceMe instead of Entice Me).  I don't know how the management could allow that to happen, but clearly someone isn't doing their job.

It took forever for my drinks to come up, especially the hot beverages that my table ordered after their meal and the manager didn't even come over and speak to us, apologize for the wait or offer to take the coffees off our bill, which I found incredibly disrespectful.  I asked the server to point out who the manager was to me, and low and behold she looked to be too young to be drinking in a bar let alone running one.  She was too busy gossiping with the bartender and using her phone to bother paying attention to how the restaurant was being run.  Maybe that's why it took the bartender so long to make our drinks.

The food was overpriced and undersized.  I found the flavours to be very boring, nothing warranting the price.  The server suggested we try the carbonara raviolo and the k-beef ribs, but my wife is a vegetarian so her only option was an underwhelming salad.  Their menu online said that they had a mushroom soup, but it was nowhere to be found, and when inquired about, the server explained that the menu had been changed numerous times due to bad reviews.   For a restaurant in trendy Queen West, there are surprisingly few options on the menu for people who suffer from dietary restrictions and/or allergies.  There are no healthy vegetarian options and even the fish, which I thought would be a healthy choice, was drenched in a buttery sauce.

The only other table in the restaurant was a group of loud, twenty-something year old kids who were being given free shots by the management all night. 

As a customer who walked in off the street, and lives in the neighbourhood, I do not think this restaurant is a good fit for Queen West and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Skip the brunch - food (tried the benny) is presentable but just tasted bland. Chic space, though."}
{"text":"great little spot we found on queens way. Very hip chic atmosphere. We came in a Saturday at 11am for brunch. No wait and plenty of comfy seating available. Smaller menu but flavorful options. Their mimosas are only 8$ and are served in very tall flute glasses and just the right oj to champagne ratio. We all really enjoyed our food but the grilled cheese and avocado toast stood out. The servers were also very friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Ambience and service were great but the menu needs tweaking. My biggest disappointments were the pasta dishes. The raviolo, although the concept and the flavours were there, the pasta was too thick and in order to keep the integrity of the egg, the pasta was under done. The fish and chips were tasty, one of the best dishes but the pile of greens in the middle were not dressed or seasoned so we didn't eat them. Again with the wild boar Ragu, the pasta was too thick and chewy. The lamb chops were cooked perfectly but the mix of cauliflower and kale left a lot to be desired. The kale was extremely tough. The presentation on the dessert was top notch. One dessert was fig and cherries on a panna cotta that could have benefited from less gelatine and the uncooked chocolate biscuit cake had an odd texture like the biscuits were over processed. 

They had just changed the menu so I would definitely give them another try. Wine prices are great."}
{"text":"Came here this past Friday night with a date and had so so much fun. My date and I were walking down the street looking for somewhere to have a couple drinks and this place caught his eye. We went inside, were immediately greeted like family, the man at the door hung up my coat and asked where we would like to sit. We chose the bar as we wanted to see the TV screens in the bar, their bar top is made up of TV screens.. So cool. The lighting behind the bar was pink neon lights and was very trendy. The owner himself, Ali, and a bartender named Brendan (I think, sorry!) were both taking care of my date and I and they were so friendly and kind. We had fun just chatting with them! They have great cocktails and one of them used a wood chip smoker to add some extra flavour and the presentation was spectacular. My date and I couldn't stop raving about it afterwards. We will definitely be back! Thank you Ali! Also huge bonus - hand cream in the washrooms, this is a small detail but Hugely appreciated, especially in the winter!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and was pleasantly surprised.  It's a pretty large space so great for big groups.

The decor is unique in that weird but interesting way.  Check out the top of the bar, or the monkey holding the candle at the back..lol.

I ordered the Benny (I asked for my eggs to be cooked hard bc I hate runny/yolk-y eggs and they were still a bit runny) with the sweet potato hash and the greens.

The sweet potato hash was the BOMB!  I scraped every bit of that deliciousness up!  The greens were nicely dressed.  Overall it was a good meal.

It was pretty empty for brunch so the service was fast.  I'm curious to try out their dinner menu and see the vibe then.

It's definitely more like a lounge feel at night as the sofas at the front lend to that atmosphere.  

Plenty of street parking in front."}
{"text":"Well, after creeping their instagram and honestly, drooling. I finally made it here. It completely lived up to what the impression I got from checking out their food online.

We went for Sunday brunch. I had no idea they had live jazz on that day so I totally claimed I brought them in for my friends. (They didn't believe me).  They were wonderful and really livened up the  atmosphere. It's a beautiful modern but fresh space. Welcoming.

The food and presentation was on point. Regardless of what you ordered everything looked appetizing. I ordered the three eggs breakfast dish. Heaven. The real surprise for me was the sweet potato hash. I could have eaten an extra bowl of that stuff. 

Coffee was delicious.

Customer service was great not just from the server but every single person. They seem pretty adamant on making sure they acknowledge everyone that enters.

We lingered for awhile after brunch was finished. They were great at not kicking us out.

Highly recommend. Reasonable prices. Great atmosphere. Good food.

I can't think of a thing I didn't enjoy. I look forward to trying their dinner menu."}
{"text":"I see some one star reviews in the past and they seem like \"revenge reviews\" from the competition - which yelp should sanction. This is not a one star place. Also it is not a five star place either , though it is obvious they strive for it. 

The ambience is four stars. Nice wooden tables with heavy metal bases, embossed walls and a very nice bar plot.  Candles on the tables and nice lighting. I didn't care for the hip hop/house music playing. Something more loungey and chill would be more appropriate. 

The service was very attentive and courteous. Multiple mangers and waiters came to our table. The restaurant was mostly empty, which is strange for queen west even on a weeknight. 

I heard their cocktails are great but I am a beer drinker when I go out.  My girlfriend ordered the fried Thai chicken ($20) while I had the Bison spare ribs ($30). The chicken was supposed to be crispy outside but it wasn't, and was still pink near the bone. No big deal, some people like it that way, but my girlfriend didn't.  As Chef Ramsey always says - taste the food while cooking!  

My bison plate had polenta mash and grilled vegetables bed which tasted amazing! However the bison ribs themselves didn't. They tasted heavy, very little flavor and even stale.  I know bison has a heavy taste naturally, but with proper spices and cooking it could be much more appetizing.  

I would come here again to taste their brunch menu, in which they specialize apparently, but the dinner menu left me unimpressed, especially for queen west, where the competition is tough (Carmen is a few blocks up and Nuit Social few blocks down)."}
{"text":"Great for groups and dates alike. The setting is very trendy and warming. The room is also designed to keep your conversations within your own are.  In other words, it is not too echoy and the ambiance makes you want to stay long.  
Did someone say prosecco?  The prix fixe menu was on point and the dessert.... I'm not a big dessert person but I will make an exception for this spot!"}
{"text":"Great food for the price. Outside of the chicken, everything was very good. The chicken was very bland. The bore, cheese were good. The duck was great."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem for brunch.  There is no line up and it is spacious with great service.
We had a few orders of the chicken and waffles.  OMG they were so good.  Spicy, crispy and the maple syrup with sriracha was great.  I would say the best chicken and waffles that I have had on queen west! 
Someone at the table also had the avocado salad which was good, and another person had the poached eggs which they really liked.  We also had an order of the french toast which was amazing.  It was delicious, but not too sweet.  The strawberries on top were perfect with the maple syrup as well.
They also had a live band playing.  I don't know if it is a regular thing or for the birthday party that was being hosted there, but it was a lovely addition to our brunch.
Service was phenomenal and they even have high chairs and are great with children!"}
{"text":"Excellent - a great addition to the Queen West Village. Chef Ryan Wilson-Lal (ex AGO) is doing amazing things here as usual. Great food, excellent interior, great vibe."}
{"text":"came here for the mother's day special.

there was a very small bit sized apple crumble that was delicious but it was like a tease, they gave you enough just to know what it tasted like and that was it.

now for the set mother's day meal..

from the appetizers i chose the maple mascarpone blintz, raspeberry compote, candy lemon zest. i did try to falafel app as well, but this was the much better option in my opinion. it was almost like a dessert before the entree.

for the main. i went with the smoked salmon & spinach benny, bearnaise sauce, asparagus kale salad, lemon vinaigrette. 2 main things i didn't like about it. the poached egg was cooked too thoroughly. not a single person at our table who ordered with had a runny yolk. the other thing was the salad tasted like pure vegetation. that bitter raw plant taste

for dessert i had the affogato coffee ice cream shot, shot of espresso, vanilla caramel profiterole. i think all of these would've taste great separately, but the ice cream and profiterole was just sitting in the espresso.

overall wasn't a huge fan."}
{"text":"Entice Culinary Lounge is located on Queen St. W. near Ossington Ave. This bustling strip of Queen St. W. is filled with many restaurants. My friend and I spontaneously tried out the restaurant on a Sunday for brunch as there were long waits for restaurants close by. We were hesitant at first since the place was fairly empty but it was a good solid choice. On Sundays there is even a live 2 person jazz ensemble playing us live music which was a bonus.

Service was friendly and what you would expect, we asked our waitress to take pictures for us and she agreed several times. In terms of food, I ordered an Americano to start and it came out promptly, no complaints there. My friend and I both ordered the avocado toast with poached eggs and shared a side of bacon. The avocado toast was okay, the bread could have been a bit more crunchy/toasted. The avocado was average and the egg was poached nicely. The side salad that came with the dish was the star. The dressing was tart but sweet at the same time. Overall, food is average and what you would expect. Service was great at the end as our waitress split the bill (and the side of bacon) for us which was smart.

When you come here you must also check out the washroom! In order to flush the toilet, it is a sensory activated flush button that changes colours. Also the hand cleanser/lotion they use is from Aesop which was a nice surprise.

Overall, food was okay and service was great."}
