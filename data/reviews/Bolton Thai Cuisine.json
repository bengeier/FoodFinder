{"text":"One of the best take outs in the area.  Food is great, friendly staff.  Only wish it were open on Mondays too!"}
{"text":"Such good food. Very good selection and a nice atmosphere. The staff are friendly and the service is excellent, dine in or take out. Lots of vegetarian/vegan selections. I love the coconut milk lemongrass soup, it is unreal. If you are looking for some exotic food in bolton, which is pretty hard to do, then this is your place."}
{"text":"Awesome red beef curry and green chicken curry! Service is always friendly and fast if you dine in but we usually do take out - which is great too! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Thai cuisine is my favorite and since I've recently started myself on a vegetarian diet, this place had plenty of vegetarian and gluten free options which I was pleased with. The service is great and there's plenty of seating. The decor is simple yet elegant and it's a cozy place for either a family dinner of a date. If y'all get a chance, definitely try the tofu satay and the red curry. I took one star away because the  Jasmine rice wasnt as aromatic or flavourful and  that's one of my favorite things to look forward to at a Thai restaurant."}
