{"text":"I order only on grubhub and I never got my order I tried to call the restaurant but there was no answer. I had to call costumer service on grubhub and they had to cancel my order and redound my money,lets see how long it takes them to actually make it. But after reading the reviews I'm happy I didn't get to try the food."}
{"text":"While going on my hourly walk at 1AM I noticed this rather tasty joint. Not having enough funds then I'd care to say I decided to get a snack rather than a meal. I saw these ravishingly delicious brownies but did not want to commit to them until I could confirm these brownies were the bees knees. The man at the register tells me they're amazing and he says I should get one. Being a customer who trusts the workers opinion on their product, I decided to purchase this brownie. And boy was I in for a treat... A treat of HELL! This brownie was no brownie let me tell you but a sad excuse for dirt flavored dough. I take a bite into \"amazing\" and found nothing amazing other than the fact that I was able to swallow this scum of a dish. Seeing that it was nothing but a waste of money I decided I would make the best of this utterly disappointing desert and save it for later. While finishing my hourly walk I began to get a odd and foreboding feeling in my stomach. Not knowing what this ominous sign meant I decided to ignore and keep on choogin' like the great John Fogerty. It wasn't until 5 minutes into my walk that I realized something was wrong and it was the fact that my stomach had just consumed an uncooked dish. Feeling this pain slowly take its toll on me like mankind on the great and loved honey bees, I decided that the pain that I had suffered is far too great for any other man, woman, or being, dead or alive, should have to go through like myself. I took the remains of my \"brownie\" and gave it to my creature of a roommate, bought a phone, downloaded the Yelp app, created an account (and email), and wrote this review. I hope this warning has saved you and countless others, for be warned, no one is safe from the brownies that lurk inside The Slice Factory. However their interior design was nice. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"The pizza is huge and the quality is decent. Customer service is terrible! The manager gives students a hard time about the free slice of pizza deal (sign up with the app and get a free slice). I followed the instructions, verified my email, and input my google voice phone number. Apparently they like to call the phone number as a secondary verification and apparently I'm not allowed to use my google voice phone number (valid and registered to me) as such verification. All this hassle for $6 worth of pizza."}
{"text":"Something of a disappointing experience to be honest. While the slices are really big for a reasonable price, the quality of the food reminds me of the cafeteria pizza from grade school.   The slice is taken from the warming case when you order and put into the oven for a little while to crisp up. The result is a slice that isnt evenly warmed with spots that are cool/soggy and parts that are warm/crispy. The crust is also far too thick for a slice this size and the toppings are of, frankly, mediocre quality and distribution. The sauce is bland and there really isnt enough of it (particularly to stand up to such a thick crust).  Overall, I can't say I recommend. The big slice is a nice gimmick but Zas next door makes exponentially better pies. Plus theirs' are made to order and don't sit there for who knows how long. 2 stars."}
{"text":"How long has this company been around? The world's worst pizza ever!! I ordered a veggie slice. They basically made cheese pizza first, and then added fresh loose topping on the top???????? There was so much oil in there, you might get a cardiac arrest from eating it for straight 2 days only. I hate this place!"}
{"text":"Food can be a bit of a gamble. Been there twice, the first time I ordered a pepperoni slice with fried ravioli, gave me mozzarella sticks and said they didn't even have the ravioli ( why is it on the menu then..). Second time got the margarita slice, it was alright I suppose, my friend got sick from it and it is definitely overpriced. They need more variety and better trained staff."}
{"text":"Dear businesses: if you're charging over $7 for one single slice of pizza, you should re-evaluate every decision in your life that led you to that. Sure, some college student will wander in and pay it once to avoid a hangover.  But nobody's going to return with prices like that. I would have never ordered a slice of pizza if I knew it would cost over $7. The quality of the pizza, especially the crust, is solidly \"mid-grade frozen pizza\". Even a Home Run Inn frozen pizza is better. The only good thing I can say about this slice of pizza is that it was big. It wasn't good, it wasn't affordable, it was just... big."}
{"text":"An absolutely atrocious establishment. Made all the worse that it tried to \"replace\" Antonio's pizza presence on green st. Cold, soggy and poor quality. Got it drunk once and I still knew it was terrible. Avoid like the plague."}
{"text":"This is a really good pizza place from Chicago the  slices are extremely big and the prices are not bad either I'm hoping to see great things to come u would recommend this place to anyone for a quick bite to eat"}
{"text":"Not only was I vomiting for 24 hours straight from this fly-infested pizza, but these savages killed Azzip Pizza. RIP.  One star is generous. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered through Grub hub. Had the Beefed up fries, Boneless wings, and Fried dough. Best thing was not much wait time even for a game day Sunday, otherwise we won't order from here again. The fries were \"warm\" and missing the giardiniera, the meat was tender but could have used some extra spice/flavor. The \"boneless\" wings were cool and unsauced even though we asked for them to be sauced and tossed (cool food with refrigerator cold sauce makes for a terrible review). The fries dough was very greasy and tasted like oil except for the pieces that did have powdered sugar sprinkled on them, it's more like fried pie crust, hard thin and of course COLD. Maybe pizza would have been a better option"}
{"text":"This pizza is literally cardboard with toppings. They made a comment to me about Antonio's closing and them being better since they are in business but the pizza is disgusting and I wish I would have never paid for it. If you want cardboard, then eat here."}
{"text":"Ok, Slice factory opened this Saturday on Green street, and I went there on the third day after they launched. So:  Pros: the pizza was ok/good. The slices are very big so one can fill an average person. I also tried the mac 'n cheese bites. They were ok/good also.   Cons: I don't know if this was because they have just opened the place or what, but they charged me more than the menu price \"because it was in their system \"! I got the mac n cheese bite, and it was $4.95 in the menu. They asked for $6.57. First I thought I made a mistake (32% tax?!) and asked for a receipt. The cashier said they have no receipt to give me. Then I mentioned the price, and he said it is 5.95 in our system. Which is totally unacceptable. If you write $4.95 on the menu, this is what you should take from the customer . OR at least mention the extra dollar they have to pay. Don't be sneaky and act as if nothing happened! It made me feel very bad. I don't care about 1$, but as a new business, you should avoid such scams.  Also, no condiments. Compare it to Antonio's or Azzip, with different hot sauces, crushed red pepper, mozzarella, salt and pepper, etc. nothing!   Annd, there were three flies in the pizza display section, sitting on the pizzas and flying around. Nope.  PI don't think I would go back. I don't wanna pay extra without knowing!"}
