{"text":"Intricately delicious and creative food served promptly by expert and informed staff.  Great, quiet, soft ambiance with smooth tasteful R&B soundtrack playing in the background.  Ask for coco bread to soak up the remaining addictive chicken thigh jus.  5 Star end-to-end experience.  Great date spot. Swift and timely service.  Desserts will Delight!!!!"}
{"text":"I will go to a great length to make sure my last remaining days are spent in a living and breathing state of happiness just to have a taste of the crispy pata again. The crispy skin is like a 100 tonne nuclear assault on my taste buds."}
{"text":"I've been to Lamesa multiple times and just keep loving it more and more. Right now they have this play on fish and chips that is incredible. I'm not a huge fish fan but I can't get enough. Also the ginataan gulay is amazing and a must have. 

If you enjoy cocktails my personal favorites are the Tito boy and LoLo Cool J. Careful they will creep up on you! 

The service has always been friendly and accommodating. I'll definitely be going back, it's hard to pass up such great food."}
{"text":"Absolutely unique experience!! My two young kids could hardly contain their excitement to dig into their kamayan (hand to mouth) sunday dinner laid onto banana leaves.

No complain about the service and Filipino meal and sauces were amazing, a bit pricey though but its all worth it. We've been wanting to try this restaurant for a long time..it did not disappoint us!"}
{"text":"Foodgasm. My dinner date and I both had the green mango salad (sweet, fresh) and the pancit (warm, flavorful), and it was love at first bite. I had to take a second order of pancit to go. It barely survived the drive home! Hip place with terrific service. I'll be back with reinforcements. Thank you for the lovely evening!"}
{"text":"Woo! I love Filipino food. I had the corn beef lumpia, chicken adobo and braised beef with bone marrow. The beef was so tender. I had it with the garlic rice which was so delicious! The servers were friendly, attentive. The presentation of the food was very nice. The adobo was so yummy. the dishes were cooked so flavorful. For dessert, i had the ube leche flan. it was delicious!! so good, my two favourite things combined: ube & leche flan.i would recommend this place to others and come back again!"}
{"text":"Sooo delicious!! The sauces are lick your plate good. Friendly staff, fun decor. I was really impressed and wish I'd gone here sooner. Will definitely be back. My first Halo Halo and it was ."}
{"text":"The food was good and inventive. It's nouveau-Filipino food instead of traditional. The Saging (banana) Cheesecake and Salabat Tea (traditionally just ginger but was infused with pear here) were to-die for!!

The $35 Tasting Menu (basically a prix fixe menu) is worth it especially as an appetizer and entrée (or entrée and dessert) cost pretty close to $35 already.

The wine selection was aso pretty good although it was, in my opinion, a little too overpriced. As an example, a bottle of J. Lohr Cabernet sells for $45 at the Keg Steakhouse while here, it's $60. 

Lastly, I thought the menu was a little skimpy -- there were only 2 or 3 choices per course."}
{"text":"The ambiance, music and service were great. The appetizers were delicious we had the mango salad and spring rolls. The entries were decent and served mildly hot. It seemed like the sat for a while after they were made. Wish food would have been hotter. Also, the place seems to have a draft. We felt a bit cold without our jackets."}
{"text":"I had been curious about this place for awhile, so decided to check it out recently as we had tickets to a play nearby. We shared three dishes: the beet salad, the pork, and the noodles. The menu is very short (which I like). I enjoyed the beet and pork dishes but found the noodles way too salty. Service was very friendly. I thought the food was expensive. I'd probably go again to try the Sunday \"eat with your hands\" menu as it sounds interesting."}
{"text":"We tried the Kamayan \"Hand-to-Mouth\" dinner. Flavourful and filling, and covers a wide range of dishes and sauces. A feast for the palate and the eyes. Includes an informative guided tour of each dish."}
{"text":"Lamesa was where my husband and I had our first date 2 years ago and we come every year on the anniversary of our first date and sit at the same table. The food and service is always exceptional. The staff are always so warm, friendly and knowledgeable of their menu. Being of Filipino background, the food is absolutely delicious with a nice twist to Filipino cuisine. Not many dishes make me want to cry that it's so good, but I must say Lamesa has me crying tears of joy over many of their delicious dishes. My most recent \"make me want to cry\" dish was their ube leche flan which Lamesa was so kind to give to us on the house to celebrate our anniversary. The calamansi gel on the side was a beautiful touch that just tickles your palette. We look forward to coming here every year and try to visit more often when we can. We are always excited to see what else they come up with. Thank you Lamesa for the amazing food and for being the perfect setting for bringing me and the love of my life together :)"}
{"text":"The kamaiyan is awesome and a lot of fun, definitely recommend it.  Their homemade hot sauce is great, smoked fish is wonderful."}
{"text":"Found La Mesa while looking for a place to have dinner on Queen St. and picked it on a whim. No reservation, seated at last table in the back. Special of the day was crispy pata, so we tried that. Also got halohalo sisig, garlic rice, and one other dish that I forgot (Kare kare? Adobo?)..."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time after eating many times at Lasa by Lamesa. It was definitely worth the trip! We stopped in on Wednesday night and their special was the chef's choice for $40 (regular $50). So much food and we got to try almost everything in the menu. Great introduction to the restaurant. More similar to Lasa than I thought it would be."}
{"text":"Normally i do not post. But this restaurant was amazing, we went sunday evening they have special menu, hand to mounth, was unique eating with our hands, the presentation, combination of flavors and textures were amazing!!!! Very recomended for a unique experience.. Also the atmosphere is good...."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto in May of 2014. After a long day of sightseeing, we were walking along Queen St. looking for a place to eat and picked this on a whim. It happened to be crispy pata night (Wed.), so we ordered that, along with halohalo sisig, garlic rice, and at least one other dish I can't remember (Kare kare? Adobo?)... Oh and a bottle of wine. No wonder I can't remember. 

Service was a bit slow, food took a long time to come. The sisig arrived first, it was nice but the portion was really kinda small. We could've had one each, but not for the price. But when the crispy pata arrived, all was forgiven. Oh man. That sweet, crisp, succulent flesh was divine. Ahhh. The dipping sauces made it even better.

If I'm ever in Toronto again on a Wednesday night, I might stop in here again for that crispy pata. But I won't be sharing it again. No way."}
{"text":"Ordered the tasting menu to introduce Filipino food to the un-initiated. Was good but for me, the crispy pata was INSANE. Whole pork shank with crispy skin and fat and meat. Fantastic. I can pretty much eat that all the time."}
{"text":"???????????????

{"text":"This place is so friendly and sweet! They accommodated us without a reservation, and I'm really glad they did! Next time I'll call ahead. The food was perfect comfort on a cool fall day. My favourites were the chicken adobo and the noodles. I'll definitely be back - it hasn't been there that long but it's got a vibe of classic Queen Street."}
{"text":"Omg this place is absolutely AMAZE BALLS!  I was skeptical when I read the menu thinking to myself there's no way all of these things together will taste that good.  Boy was I wrong - every bite was tantalizing and left me craving for more."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences we had in Toronto, the 5 course tasting menu (relly a 3 course, the two amuse courses were small, good but not overly interesting) changes by the day, we had the halo-halo (mixed meat with rice and an egg on top, served in hot iron pan) which won universal praise, it was very tastey and the texture was perfect, yet at the same time it was simple and homey. The beef main course was perfectly cooked, tender and flavourful, and the sweet-potatoe sauce was creative and interesting, though the veggie was a bit overcooked. The jackfruit creme burlee was amazing, one of the best dessert I've ever had. After the meal my friend found the chef and hugged him. It also had great atomsphere and happy, friendly staff. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This is the first and probably only Yelp review I will ever write.

Why?

Because this place was just so amazing.

Not just the food, but the service too.

My girlfriend and I, having never had Filipino food before, didn't really know what to expect. Our waiter informed us about Lamesa's M.O., stating that it is more a modern take on traditional Filipino cuisine; furthermore he introduced and explained each of the 5 dishes as they came out, which added to the atmosphere and generally what has added to me writing this review.

Everything is great, but I really remember their ribs over all.

Treat yourself, you deserve it :)"}
{"text":"We conquered the entire menu. And let me tell you, I would do it all over again."}
{"text":"Really great food ! I moved to queen west neighbourhood last year and now can't believe it took me so long to try out this place !"}
{"text":"As someone born and raised in the Philippines, I've had my fair share of great Filipino food. I've been in Toronto for more than 5 years and have had a few ok Filipino food here. Lamesa, for me, is one of those. It's good but a little pricey. 
We had the hand to mouth experience or kamayan in Filipino. The table was covered in banana leaves as it is traditionally. The servers then placed sauces on the leaves first then started placing one entree after another and made a really lovely presentation. There was a salad, roasted pork in a couple of shiso leaves topped with achara (pickled papaya and radish), garlic rice, some roasted corn and okra, devilled eggs, fried chicken wing, ribs, milkfish, clams in coconut sauce and I've cornbread. My favourites were the roasted pork and the ribs. The roasted pork was especially delicious with some mango hot sauce. The devilled egg's told tasted like palabok sauce. Again, everything tasted good, with a couple exceptional dishes but a little pricey at $40 per person."}
{"text":"Small portion. Over priced. But good ambiance and service. Not your typical filipino food."}
{"text":"Lamesa, popped up in my neighbourhood of Queen and Bathurst where the Rosebud used to be located. I was very excited as this is a cuisine that is relatively new to me.  Les Sabilano, the co-owner of Lamesa explained that his concept is to introduce Filipino food to the mainstream. The word \"Lamesa\" means \"table\", which is the epicentre of the Filipino home and that is the feeling they wanted to bring into the restaurant. 
We selected the $35 prix fixe tasting menu as we believed this would give us the variety we were looking for and put our journey in the hands of the talented Chef Rudy Boquila. 

We were immediately served a little shot glass of watermelon juice as a palette cleanser. It was quite refreshing for a hot summer evening. The first dish was amazing: lumpia asado (Filipino spring rolls) with soy glaze. I have definitely had chinese and thai rolls and these are similar, but with a uniqueness to them as well. The next dish was one of my favourites of the evening was their coconut and corn soup - such a lovely balance of flavours with a velvety texture. I would go back and order a big heaping bowl of this soup.
Next we were brought a delicate house made crepe with sinigang in it, which is a sour stew with a heavy influence of tamarind. It was very flavourful.  Fourth up was a dish of sisig halo halo.  \"Halo halo\" literally means \"mix mix\" which in this case is a blend of chicken, pork, beef with a fried egg and a pico de halo sauce over it served in a small iron skillet. You are encouraged to break the egg and mix it up with the different meats and it was amazing. We also had a helping of their pancit which is traditionally made with shrimp, but for our meal was substituted with mushrooms as my dinner date, Carlos had a shellfish allergy. This is a noodle stir fry dish mixed with veggies and while it is simple, it has a good texture and balance of flavour. After five dishes we still weren't done! We had only just begun as those were all our appetizers! Can you believe it?

Our mains were plated next -a juicy beef short rib that falls off the bone placed atop a pineapple carrot puree and olive tapenade which adds this sour/sweet element to the dish. My favourite main was the pork belly adobo: a confit of pork belly served with soy, vinegar and a smear of black garlic puree. The belly was crispy and so flavourful and was complimented well with the sides on the plate.
We were so full at this point and so satisfied. Carlos commented that this was a novel place where it adapts the traditions from the Philippines and innovates them through plating, deconstructing flavours and elevating simple dishes. Finally our desserts came - we got a few of them. We had a house made soft cheese cake which looked like a scoop of soft ice cream and it was heavenly. Even Carlos, who is not a fan of cheesecake, licked his spoons. We also had their jackfruit creme brûlée and it was sweet and light. We were also given a trio of house made sorbets - young coconut, jackfruit and pineapple. Finally, there was a home made rice cookie and my very favourite, the turon, a purple yam stuffed empanada.  mmmmMMM! There were so many firsts for me in terms of dishes, new names, everything. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I was here for Valentine's Day with my partner and we had the 7 course set meal. The chicken dish, seafood pasta and beef dish were all served at a temperature between lukewarm- cold. It really felt like the kitchen was rushed and put little effort in making everything. I didnt complain about the chicken and then I had to say something about the seafood pasta. The server who was a nice girl sent it back and made me a new one which came out piping hot. When the same thing happened with my beef dish I told her to not bother and just take it away. After everything, there was no manager who came to our table to apologize for this whole ordeal. I understand it was Valentine's Day and the place was packed but that is still no excuse! I will not be returning. 

I only felt bad for my poor partner who hates complaining at restaurants and half heartedly finished most of every dish, which also says a lot since he usually polishes everything."}
{"text":"There seems to be a lot of misconceptions about Filipino food here in Toronto.  There are some who write in blogs that will remain unnamed alleging that Filipino food is the ugly sister of Asian cuisine.  (Whoever wrote this is forever on my hit-list.  Beyond the obviously misogynous implications of this analogy, how ignorant do you have to be to make that claim?  Do you not know that there is a wide variety of Filipino food and that making such a broad generalization on the basis of one meal is moronic).  There are those who think that Filipino food is AMAZING, but only when done in the traditional manner.  And there are those, such as the proprietors of The Purple Yam restaurant in NYC (http://www.purpleyamnyc.com/) who see that the time is right for different, non-traditional interpretations of Filipino food.

The proprietors of Lamesa Filipino Kitchen belong to the latter.  The controversy that has emerged from Lamesa primarily concerns its 'modern' take on Filipino food.  Sadly, most of its detractors have yet to set food in the restaurant.  Once they do, they might find themselves pleasantly surprised.

In a nutshell, this was, by far, a great restaurant.  I was impressed that they decided to do away with the trappings of standard Filipino restaurants, such as  pictures of the Last Supper and carabao figurines.  The interiors were sleek and spacious, with bright white walls and an impressively ornate gold ceiling.  The service was exemplary - not too obtrusive but extremely friendly and warm, with each server making sure that clear explanations accompanied each dish.  

Like other reviewers have written, you can order a la carte or you can eat from the tasting menu.  The menu varies weekly, giving the chef the opportunity to flex his culinary muscles and try different creative dishes.  

Tonight, the menu consisted of an amuse bouche of corn soup with bacon, which was a perfect amalgamation of creamy and salty.  

Then there was the halo-halo sisig, which definitely did not have the pork ears that are found in traditional sisigns but still maintained sisig's essence by providing crunchy pork and a fried egg.  Welcome additions were tomatoes and a wonton-like cracker.  When combined, this provided great texture.  The flavours worked.  The lemon that was provided with the dish gave the saltiness a delightfully citrusy taste.  My personal preference would have been a little bit more spice but I can understand why they opted to not put a few sprinkles of siling labuyo (red pepper) because this can be overwhelming.

The mains were great.  The beef rib kaldereta was unlike any kaldereta I've had at my grandmother's house.  The beef was tender and succulent and so full of flavour; the carrot-pineapple puree that accompanied it complemented the beef, and the bits of potato were great touches.  This kaldereta was so good that, at $24 a la carte, it felt like a steal - similar beef ribs served in more expensive, 'mainstream' establishments like, say, Canoe do not have the same level of complex flavours.

The pork belly adobo was also good though this felt more like pork liempo rather than the traditional adobo.  But hey, who am I to quibble?  It was orgasmic.  The crunchy skin of the pork was especially scrumptious; the black garlic puree, the ginger, and the sweet garlic that served as accoutrements elevated the dish.  My only concern was that towards the end, the crunchy skin lost a bit of its, well, crunch, but it could just be that I was taking my time talking and drinking, rather than getting right to business and eating.  

The fourth course was their interpretation of a key lime pie, this time with calamansi. It was fine.  My partner loved it but I don't have a sweet tooth so I'm not the best judge of these things.

The fifth and last course - the jackfruit creme brulee - was the highlight.  The surface was nicely coated with caramelized sugar but what lay underneath was impressive!  Langka (jackfruit) made into creme brulee is the work of geniuses!  Who would've thought that this would work?  I devoured mine, only giving my partner a tiny bite.  He had an empanada with plantains, which tasted good, but in my blissful state devouring the jackfruit creme brulee, I barely bothered to pay it any heed.

Additional highlights were the cocktails, which were each roughly 12 bucks each, which meant that this was standard for Queen street.  We each got the Lolo and the Lola cocktails, which were yummy (and quite strong)!

The owners said that their goal is to make sure that people start talking about FIlipino food.  For those of you who are still hesitating, COME TO LAMESA.  Just because this isn't your grandmother's (or your friend's grandmother's) filipino food doesn't mean that is less Filipino.  For someone who eats in my fair share of restaurants, Lamesa was, by far, one of the best meals I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for the hand to mouth experience (during Sunday dinner). Food was delicious and nicely placed on a banana leaf by the chef. It's a fix menu for $40/person but comes with a variety of meats so don't worry about not getting full. Service was excellent, would recommend this place for anyone that is looking for a fun unique experience."}
{"text":"Review is for Sunday's Kamayan. Overall, an interesting experience. The setup for the food on banana leaf is a performance in itself. Taking you to another place. It's also not everyday, we can devour out food with our hands. Includes various sauces and proteins with garlic rice. 

Overall, the food was either abit ordinary or a miss, the fish was too dry, the spare ribs tender, the wing over salted, rice tasty. We felt dessert should have been part of the set, but it's ordered ala carte. Service was great. Cocktails ok. So, I would recommend it more for experience than the food."}
{"text":"Visited LaMesa with my mother, who was born and raised in the Philippines. She has such a high standard for Filipino cuisine and is very hard to please when it comes to Filipino food, but she was genuinely pleased with all the dishes! We went there for brunch and got some Filipino breakfast staples such as longanisa, chicken adobo, bistek and tosino. This is all in addition to the amazing service we received and the nice atmosphere of the dining area."}
{"text":"The place is wonderfully decorated  and the service was attentive but the food and portion was not even close to make me come back. Presentation of food is excellent but no flavour. Left the place  hungry and unsatisfied. 

We ordered the chef slider and mango salad for app. The slider comes with one tiny chicken burger for $6(seriously?!). Mango salad was the only good thing. 

For our main we ordered the crispy pata($21) and sticky ribs ($18). Lets start with the no flavour for both. We had to ask for salt to give both flavour. 
The crispy pata was really hard to cut thru and by the way both mains doesnt come with any sides. 
The ribs was so bland it smelled and taste like plain boiled meat. Go somewhere else to get your Filipino Food fix."}
{"text":"We did the Kamayan Sunday Dinner and it was EXCELLENT. Great service, real fun way to eat a meal and super tasty. Definitely recommend the experience to anyone. Fun to sit in the window too and watch as people looking in wondering what we were doing! Probably a bit pricey if you just consider the food received but the experience alone was worth half the cost, so all in all a good deal."}
{"text":"Normally i would give this place a minimum 4 stars, but i was recently disappointed by my recent brunch visit as their service and professionalism didn't meet expectations. We made a reservation for 11am for our brunch meal, arrived well before our seating time and waited till 11:20 for the restaurant to even OPEN before we finally decided to just leave. I know it's not a critique of their food which, on a more positive note, is normally very good. I'm just upset over it and needed to express my experience. We called the restaurant several times while waiting and even replied to their confirmation text earlier that morning. Big disappointment, enough to keep us away for awhile. They really defined true \"Filipino time\"."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not your typical Filipino restaurant.  What you'll find here is a more refined, re-interpreted version of your Filipino favourites. My boyfriend and I each opted for the Chef's Tasting Menu.  The menu items are constantly changing, so while I could recommend things I can't guarantee that they will be on the menu when you go there.  I had the vegetarian pancit as the appetizer (pulutan).  It was good, but defintely does not have as much flavour as your traditional pancit.  I had the caldereta as the main course and the steak was just so tender and cooked to perfection.   It was also served with a bit of a sweet potato sauce which was a nice touch.  The stand-out item for me was the jackfruit creme brulee dessert.  I could have had about 10 of those in one sitting they were so delicious.  I am constantly daydreaming about it.  It was a perfect end to the meal."}
{"text":"I didn't know Filipino food very well before going, and I ended up asking lots of questions about the ingredients.  The staff were friendly, knowledgeable, and seemed genuinely happy to share info about the cuisine.  

Decor is nice, atmosphere is nice, and the food was amazing (crispy pork belly, a type of ceviche, etc etc).  We had an early dinner on a weekday evening and it was packed!  Book early for a table!"}
{"text":"The first time I went there, it was hit and miss, Maybe it's Becuase the flavours are quite new to me.. tried a few dishes but overall not that impressive. Yam pudding and garlic rice are my favorites (I can't say if they are authentic or not but some dishes do have a strong fishy taste, and stinky socks kind of smell). I must say the servers there are super awesome. 
Second time tried the hand to mouth Kamayan.Again some sauce taste quite fishy and I didn't like it that much.. But the food with their presentation is amazing!! Recommended~ but before you go, look it up if they offer this since they only have it on a certain date of the week"}
{"text":"A fixed menu is offered on Sundays where food is served on banana leaves with out any silverware.  Great food and unique experience!  Highly recommend.  $40 per adult, $10 per kid with a smaller offering."}
{"text":"We've been meaning to try this restaurant for awhile now. They also have the Kamayan dinner where you eat with your hands but they didn't have it that night. So we had the a-la-carte tonight. We started with SISIG - Pig's face, chicken gizzard, fried egg, rice. Yummy, the pork was very tasty.

For the mains, we selected a few:

- BICOL EXPRESS - Pork cheek, chillies, coconut, bagoong
- LECHON KAWALI - Pork belly, atchara, Mang Tomas, sawsawan
- BISTEK - Beef shortrib, braised leek, grilled scallion, crispy onion

All the dishes were delicious and it is more for sharing as eating the entire dish by yourself is very filling. It's similar to Chinese dishes where you need rice along with it as well. The atmosphere itself, small restaurant, very narrow, tables are very packed together, only a small aisle to get in and out. I was sitting on the couch side and the height was taller than the table so it was very uncomfortable to eat, my back hurts after dinner."}
{"text":"Brunch here is pretty awesome!

My friend and I had the same thing: the Silog Breakfast.  But we couldn't decide on which of the three protein options, so we asked for them all (additional $8 charge, but totally worth it)!  Next time though, I think I'll stick with the pork belly and the longanisa sausage.  Way too much to eat otherwise.

The food was just wonderful.  I'm a relative newbie to Filipino food, but I love it.  The cassava hash is my new favourite breakfast food, and the garlic rice was divine. 

Service was great and attentive.  I took off one star only because the coffee was good, but not amazing.

Will be back!
C."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good especially the Lechon kawali dish. though it is always a hit or miss coming here."}
{"text":"I came on a Friday and I was told the restaurant was fully booked until 9:30pm when I called in earlier to make reservations. My friend and I ended up coming here for desserts after 9:30pm and it was just as packed when we arrived. The staff were very accommodating and we, somehow, got a table. 
We ordered all 3 of the desserts- ovaltine cheesecake, ensaymada bread pudding and ginataan sundae. The ginataan sundae was quite big and was good for sharing- the ube ice cream with the tapioca was delicious. The ensaymada bread pudding was quite good as well and it was served warm and it was interesting with the contrast in textures. The dessert I liked the least was the ovaltine cheesecake-the taste of cheesecake definitely overpowered the malt taste. The ovaltine cheesecake was different but isn't something I would try again. The waitress that served us was friendly and knowledgeable about their menu. She took the time to explain to us what was in each dessert that we ordered.

 I was told by a friend that the dishes although authentic were Filipino fusion-a twist on popular Filipino foods. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice with the lights dimmed and music. It was not too quiet but also not too loud; it was just perfect for conversation. I will definitely return to try their other dishes but will be sure to make reservations in advance."}
{"text":"Extremely Welcoming and accommodating staff. I have multiple food restrictions that are usually challenging to maintain when I go out, but this place listened, cared and delivered. As someone with demanding dietary needs, it's so pleasant and euphoric to be able to go to a nice place for a delicious meal. This was not the first time I've been here and each time I've gone, it just keeps getting better. I told our waiter if I could have a long term relationship with the restaurant, I would /I will. We will be back. Thanks again for your kindness, amazing food and impeccable service. Peace."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Each dish is savoury with distinctive flavours. The service is also stellar! Will defintely return."}
{"text":"So we're on our honeymoon from Chicago and I decided to make a reservation. Was a long day and I know my Filipino bride would appreciate some home cooking. This place went above and beyond the norm. The sous chef Daniel came out to meet us and to see what we were in the mood for. Plate after plate came out and it was awesome. An artistic twist on traditional Filipino food. This place seemed off the beaten path to us being new to the area. If your Filipino then you will love this. If your not then your in for an awesome adventure. This place is casual and clean. Good attention to detail. By far the crispy belly adobo blew my mind. Besides looking great the preparation was spot on. Every trip to Toronto will include dinner here."}
{"text":"Ate at Lamesa a week after relocating from New York City, and it could easily hold its own against anything there.  The Ginataan (squash bread and cauliflower) was probably the best veggie dish I have ever eaten, and the meat entrees were also superb."}
{"text":"Great meal here one time, a few months later, a horrible one. 

Looks like they changed the menu recently, getting rid of many of the favourites and replacing them with ones that left a lot to be desired. The worst part of the meal was the fried bone-in pork, which was $21, and a plate of over fried pork on bone. It was very fatty, very dry, and quite bad. Had to send it back to the kitchen to have them cut it up in an fashion that would make eating possible, but by that point, the meal was a failure.

Cocktails were tasty though... lychee!"}
{"text":"I was here with a large group of my relatives, some of whom had already been to Lamesa before.  I for one was eagerly anticipating the food, so I decided to go for the $30 Price Fixe option to get a better representation of the menu.

I started out with the Krispy Pata ($18 - don't worry, it can feed a number of people).  This was not part of the price fixe, but I felt that I would be doing myself a disservice if I didn't order it...think freshly made chicharron, and you got the gist of it.  It's fatty , the skin is definitely crispy, and it won't do your diet any favours, but it's OH SO GOOD.

Other than the three central courses, the price fixe portion includes two tasting courses.  When I went, the extras were crispy chicken skin and a creamy jackfruit drink.  Both were very tasty, but watch out for the jackfruit aftertaste.  It can surprise you if you're not used to it.

Naturally, the meal came with a bowl of steamed rice.  Now for the ignorant reviewer who didn't care for the \"communal\" rice bowl...YOU'RE IN A FILIPINO RESTAURANT.  RICE IS SHARED.  I started out with the Pusit (not on the online menu, but apparently the menu can change to incorporate new items).  This was better than any non-breaded calamari appetizer I've ever had.  The addition of the coconut dipping sauce was a nice start to the whole dinner.  Very \"Southeast Asian\" taste to the whole thing.

My main dish was the Steak Frites Estofado.  FANTASTIC.  The flank steak was cooked to a perfect medium-rarity.  Since I didn't pay attention to the fries part of the menu when I read it, I was totally surprised by the fact that what I thought were potato fries were in fact plantain fries!  Add the jus to it all, along with spoonfuls of steamed rice and you get...GOODNESS.

I was pretty full at this point, but after a few drinks of my calamansi juice ($4), the nice little creme brulee came and capped off a great evening of eating out.  

Great food, staff were pleasant, attentive and accommodating (but unintrusive), and the food was worth the money.  Not the cheapest, but not the most expensive either.  Great for the Pinoy who wants to try Filipino dishes with modern twists, or the foodie who wants to try something cuisine that has not been played out in the Toronto Restaurant landscape."}
{"text":"Hail to the current Queen of Toronto, Jennifer K., for recommending this brand-spanking new Filipino restaurant.  Jennifer told us about the La Mesa on Saturday night .  The service was impeccable.  The food was delicious."}
{"text":"I am not going to deny that the food tasted good and the presentation was really well done. The ambiance is cosy with the rustic wooden furniture and murals. Especially with the Ube desert. But what was lacking was the authentic taste of the Filipino cuisine. I felt it was way too westernized.  I understand that it is a challenge to present truly authentic cuisine in a downtown environment, but in Lamesa's case it passed a certain threshold that even as a non-native like me I was able to tell that the flavors were westernized beyond recognition. My group consisted of a native Filipino and we had the Adobo and the Pork/egg dish. The meat was well cooked and the flavors were great, but with the large portion of salad and toned down authenticity, it made me question the experience overall.The Ube desert lacked the genuine Ube flavor, but nevertheless it tasted good.  My advice to the owners/chef is  to not sacrifice the essence of what makes Filipino food great just so that it caters easily to a non-Filipino palette. People visit such places to be introduced to diverse flavors and experience something unique. Don't miss out on that!"}
{"text":"It was my second visit here, the first time being brunch.  Both times, I was impressed.  Walked in on a Tuesday evening and managed to get the last seats at the bar.  The restaurant was full that evening, so I'd highly recommend reservations.  Sitting at the bar gave me a good view of what was going on behind the scenes.  The menu is well thought out and creative.  Servers were busy but moved around in a smooth waltz-like manner so one didn't get a sense of how crazy busy it really was.  I ordered an Old Fashioned and watched it being made right in front of me.  I'm going to lobby hard to get that drink named \"the Ninang\" or \"Old fashioned Ninang\" because that right there was a SOLID Old Fashioned, and, wait for it....$6.00!  Everything from the cocktails to the dishes is well executed.  Nothing is done sloppily!  I believe, if I'm not mistaken, that even the sauces are made in-house.  Stand outs include the Ginataan Gulay and of course the lechon kawali.  They ran out of the chicken chicharron by the time we got there.  Sad face.  But there will be a next time.  Dying to go back for brunch to try their ensaymada French toast but am still reeling from my \"Old Fashioned Ninang\", so would you judge me if I had that with my breakfast?"}
{"text":"We ate at Lamesa for my partner's birthday. We had the 11-course chef's tasting menu, and it was delicious!  We enjoyed every course. My favourite was a sort of congee-like dish made with spinach and fried garlic, but it's hard to choose. So much variety and creativity on display with this menu. Calamansi juice features in many of the dishes, giving a tart and sour punch which was really unique. Everything was beautifully plated and the service was attentive.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Lamesa Filipino Kitchen is where second generation Filipinos Rudy Boquila and Les Sabilano expresses their love for Filipino food. Although they like to focus their flavors and recipes on food they used to enjoy as children, they felt that it was time to rejuvenate the look and add modern twist with new menu launch. There aren't that many Filipino retaurants in Toronto that people can recommend, so what exactly is Filipino food? you may wonder. Les Sabilano sums it up as \"..a native Malay cook with a Chinese roommate, being taught by a Spanish Chef with a love affair for everything American\". I was one of the lucky few that got to see some of their new menu items which included some brunch items as well as late night menu.
 

Crispy Pata
* Deep fried pork trotter with pickles and housemade dipping sauces
* Pickles added nice crunch to the rich deep fried pork trotter
* Cooked to perfection with a nice crispy exterior

French toast Turon
* Egg dipped bread with sweet plantain and jackfruit wrapped in spring roll served with coconut whip
* Twist to your ordinary french toast, I couldn't get enough of the coconut whip which wasn't too sweet

Pork & Pancakes
* Sarsi braised pork with corn and coconut pancakes and jackfruit syrup
* I am not the biggest fan of pancakes but I loved how I could enjoy both sweet and savory at the same time

Lumpia
* Ground pork spring rolls served with housemade banana ketchup

Arroz Caldo
* Rice porridge, chicken, chicharon, crispy kale and fried garlic
* This is a must get, a little different from your everyday congee
* It is creamy and light but had depth of flavor with fried garlic and chicken

Bicol Express Fries
* Pork, coconut milk, chilies and bagoong over housemade fries
* I loved this on its own, maybe even without the fries
* Sweet creamy coconut milk was so delicious I wanted to eat it with bowl of rice

Fried chicken Adobo
* Crispy fried chicken with garlic puree, pickled chayote and adobo gastrique
* Did you know one of the most popular Filipino dishes are fried chicken?
* This is a nice dish you could try to see what it's all about and I loved the garlic puree

Ginataan Gulay
* Roasted squash, beans, greens, eggplant with coconut cream sauce

Halo Halo
* Coconut strings, sweet purpla yam, sugar, palm fruit, jackfruit with buko pandan ice cream with shaved ice and carnation milk
* This is something I always get when summer time comes along and I go to night markets
* It's sort of like shaved ice or bubble tea but with different toppings and it's always fun to eat."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place for dinner.

When I first walked in I was blown away by the smell. 
 I was able to get a table for 2 straight away. 

We ordered 3 dishes to share and we're not too blown away by any of it. Presentation was nice, value and flavour left a lot to be desired.

First was a rice dish with an egg pork and chicken. The meat pieces were tiny, and many pieces I had to spit out as they were rock hard, bones maybe?

The next portions were quite good, but underwhelming considering the price. $15 for a dish that's feature is 2 pieces of roasted cauliflower....
 
Wouldn't go back.

Flavors were nice but wouldn't pay as much for it again. 

The service was a little lack luster. The waitress made 3 trips to our table before remembering the wine I ordered."}
{"text":"Shared a tasting menu between two which was probably not enough food, so I'd recommend getting your own order. It's pricey - be prepared to drop at least $30 each person for small portions. The quality was good but not quite fancy resto good. I mean coconut milk with tapioca for dessert was delicious but nothing about it was worth a bigger price tag.

I felt like I was eating home cooking though the pork belly adobo was crisped better than a take out joint could. Kudos for trying to elevate Filipino food to another level but I don't think it has reached that level...yet!"}
{"text":"This place has great Filipino fusion cuisine! The restaurant itself is tiny yet intiate. The kamayan, or \"hand to mouth\" dinner tasting is a great introduction to those not familiar with Filipino food. The regular menu is delicious as well. The corned beef is a nice twist on a classic. I could make better chicken adobo, but it's safe but good choice. The salmon laing is also worth a try. The ube leche flan is to die for and I can't wait to try the halo halo the next time I go."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. I've never had Filipino food before so I didn't know what to expect but it was better than I could have imagined. Went in for vegetarian Sunday dinner with a group of 6- the tables were covered in banana leaves, they chefs came out and laid everything out for us like artists painting a canvas. Explained what each sauce or item was, presented everything so beautifully. There are no utensils, you use your hands, which is wonderful and makes the meal even more special.
Everything was great- service, food, value, ambiance."}
{"text":"This place is so cool. I went on a Sunday with my fiancé when they have a special menu, where you eat only with your hands. They put all the food on the table on top of banana leaves. It was a really awesome experience."}
{"text":"The food was great and so is the service, definitely will go back again, I want to try the Kamayan meal"}
{"text":"This is my second time here, blown away by the food and service as last time! So bumped out that I missed the summerlicious menu.

My first time here was for the valentine menu. The atmosphere, food and service were 5star! Very impressed, amazing experience.
This time I came here with a couple of friends for dinner. We ended up getting almost all the main dishes on the menu. The chicken adobo, beef cheek sinigang, and the other main that I can't remember. My vegetarian friend really liked his dishes too. The okras looked so good!! We all got halo halo(yehhhh!) for dessert! Best thing ever. All the ingredients worked so well together. We left the restaurant extremely satisfied, loved every bits of it.

Would've been a 5 star if lamesa  serve some more  traditional Filipino food. The modern fusion touch is nice, I love it, but without the servers or Filipino friends explaining each dishes to me I would never know they are Filipino food and easily mistaken them as food from another country. The food are a tad pricy for the amount but the effort put onto them and service made it up. Plus, it is because the food were so good I wish there were more. All the dishes looked like art to me, great attention to the details from the presentation to the ingredients. I can really see/feel/taste the chefs' passion in their food. Really appreciated everything, salamut po!

Can't wait to come back to try out the kamayan!

4.5/5"}
{"text":"It's hard to find authentic Filipino cuisine in Toronto; but finally, I was able to get an opportunity to try this amazing restaurant.

I went to try their Kamayan Sunday dinners, which is basically a hand to mouth meal, where cutlery is not required. There were bamboo leaves laid across the table, and two chefs masterfully laid out each component of our price fixed menu ($40 per person) onto the leaves. There was a huge variety of different tapa styled dishes, that were absolutely to die for. The sauces, the rice, every single item was made to perfection. I literally cleaned the food off the table/leaves! The flavors were out of this world, and I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Lovely decor, super informative staff (our waiter described each dish in detail and helped us pick the right cocktails we were looking for!), and extremely delicious food!!! The texture and flavour of their dishes is off the charts. Amazing fish entree, tofu side and broccolini side. Just  RECOMMEND 10/10"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. The poor waiter had to deal with 7 loud, chatty, indecisive girls but the food came promptly, the water glasses were always filled, and the table was always clean. 
Food was excellent. We tried all but 2 of the dishes on the menu, and, seriously, they were all very good. The only \"meh\" dish was the stir fly noodles, but overall satisfying. 
I can't wait to try their hand to mouth Sunday menu!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the Kamayan experience, it's a beautiful thing to watch them go about setting up your banana leaf with multiple different dishes and explain each and everyone while they go about it. 

I tried their in-house fresh guava juice and loved it! As far as the food is concerned my Filipino friend had warned me that everything would be fried and it was, not being a great fan of all things fried I must admit the flavours were great! I especially liked the ribs and chicken adobo. I didn't like the fish, which I thought was too salty and not even rice could help blend it all in. 

I would definitely want to come back and try their regular menu and taste the other dishes but overall I liked the ambience and it's coziness."}
{"text":"Rating is 3.5. We've been here 3 times and love the service and staff. The chicken adobo is tasty, once you swirl your chicken around to pick up the 3 sauce flavours on the plate. The ribs were ok, a little on the dry side and the sauce doesn't really \"stick\" to the meat so it didn't come together in taste for me. Our appetizers have been delicious- I love that they have a number of vegetable dish options including cauliflower, broccolini and eggplant. 
One atmosphere downer is that if you sit in the back of the restaurant, the smell from the basement rises up since they don't have a door leading downstairs, and it gives off a strong moldy scent."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and I had the Silong breakfast with pork belly. Pork was seasoned nicely and not too fatty. I loved mixing the eggs with the garlic fried rice, so good. 

Service was also great. Food came promptly, server was friendly and knowledgable when answering any questions we had about Filipino food. 

Can't wait to try their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for Saturday night which was a good call because the seating is limited. Staff were really attentive and very helpful in explaining the menu. Unfortunately the food was a big let down. The Chicken Adobe which is considered a main came with only three small pieces of chicken and no veg or rice or anything for $20. The Pancit was definitely not enough to split two ways as recommended and tasted like noodles soaked in soy sauce. Really disappointed by the food and portion size. Hopefully they'll make a few course corrections to help get this spot with lots of potential back on track."}
{"text":"Dinner

Good food, rustic but cute ambience, inventive take on Filipinno food and friendly service.

Drawbacks: Wine list can be improved, esp the reds. Pricepoint slightly on the higher side.

Repeat: certainly."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on the weekend and loved the food. The price was also somewhat reasonable
I will preface this by saying that this is my first time trying filipino food and Im not sure how to distinguish what is authentic or fusion. 
Nonetheless, i really enjoyed the food and everything served had so much flavour. 
I got the chicken adobo and the meat was so tender and delicious. It also came with salad, poached egg and garlic rice. i loved how all these simple foods were made so flavourful, the garlic rice had crunchy flakes of garlic in it and the poached egg was a good pairing with the rice. The salad also had a lemony/lime flavour to it without it feeling overpowered with dressing."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, this place is for someone that loves food full of flavour!  I am not impressed often, but the dishes blew me away. I can't wait to come back and try the chefs sample menu.

I have never had Filipino food before, I asked the server for recommendations and he basically built my dinner experience. He described every dish and explained which ingredients made the flavour unique!"}
{"text":"For Sunday brunch, we decide to try something different. So we made the trip downtown from Thornhill for Lamesa. It took us about 20 mins to find parking, which was a little frustrating and I was starving when we got in. The restaurant was quiet with only 1 other table with people and all the others were reserved but empty at 1 pm. 
I ordered the pulled pork with coconut pancakes. It was amazing! The pork was dressed in a root bear sauce and it was served with some on the side! My bf got their take on eggs Benedict, eggs Bicol, which was served with duck. It was okay. 

The meal Itself was good. What annoyed me was paying $4 for coffee that was not anything special and $4 for a 10cent bag of tea (orange pekoe) and hot water... That $8 doesn't make sense to me when the meals were priced reasonably at $10 each."}
{"text":"I had the Kamayan experience on a Sunday for one of my best friend's birthday back in March, for a party of 9. 

Holy crap, the food was delicious. The chefs started off by painting different sauces (shrimp sauce, mango hot sauce, and some garlic sauce). Then they piled so much food on our banana leaves that I didn't think I would be able to finish it all! Some of the things we had: garlic rice, BBQ pork ribs, salad, mussels, fried chicken, devilled egg, fried milk fish. When the food came, our table was literally silent for a solid 5 minutes because everyone was too busy eating and enjoying the food. Everything was cooked perfectly, and the sauces complimented the food so well. 

One thing we weren't too happy about was how long it took us to get our food. Our reservation was for 7:30 but we didn't get the banana leaves laid out on the table until 8:30. We were starving and getting hangry :( However, with the great food, top-notch music, and excellent customer service (our ube dessert was comped for the birthday), I couldn't give rate his place less than a 5. There are after all, only two \"food artists\". 

Tip for when you visit: Maybe don't come with huge groups of people."}
{"text":"I think ive only ever had one previous Filipino dining experience and I recall I was underwhelmed. I had heard of lamesa for so long now tho, and considering their ability now to have opened up a second restaurant, i figured it was high time I give Filipino cuisine a second shot -- here, specifically.

I was surprised at how many tables they managed with such a small space but even still, reservations for peak dining hours are highly recommended. Staff are incredibly friendly and patient, from providing clear explanations for each item (the majority of the names were foreign to me) to describing how they modernized it, and even how to eat (i.e. spoon and fork in lieu of knife and fork).

CEVICHE -- stunning presentation and intense but balanced flavour. Served alongside shrimp chips that crackle when topped, acting as its very own drumroll en route to your mouth. Loved this.

Chicken -- typically braised but instead served with a surprisingly crisp skin and confit garlic. Delicious, on the slightly saltier side.

Pork -- glaze is sticky sweet but balanced, very familiar flavours that less so wowed me but still well done. Meat super tender and the spoon/fork eating method definitely sufficed.

Garlic rice -- I believe their description was that this was fried rice. Intense fried garlic flavour but overall neutral enough to pair with the entrees (which themselves are not served with carbs)

Entrees are on the sliiightly higher end as far as pricing goes but not too unreasonable."}
{"text":"Keep in mind that this is \"Filipino-style\" food, not traditional \"Filipino-cuisine\".  I came here over a year ago and I remember it being better than my most recent visit.  I love the concept of this place but was afraid it fall into the Queen Street brigade of westernized-ethnic restaurants.  

I tried the bistek burger which was alright.  The halo halo sisig was a bit dry. I also remember ordering this in the past and I could swear it was a heartier portion with a stronger, fresher flavor.  The fried chicken adobe did not resemble real chicken adobe very well - it was 3 small fried chicken pieces with little hints of adobe flavor. I can buy a bucket of chicken for what this little dish costs.  To me, the consistent theme during this meal was that they were scaling back on the real, full authentic flavors.  But the food is not bad, I think the menu is good for what it is but not enough to pull me back anytime soon.  

A lot of people have complained about the service but I thought it was adequate.  In hindsight, it would have been nice if they asked what dishes we wanted first instead of just bringing them out in no particular order.  I also don't recall any fish options on the menu and fresh fish is a staple in Filipino cuisine.  

Overall, I like this restaurant but it's not on the level on nicer Filipino restaurants in California.  I just wish they'd increase the portion sizes and turn up the authenticity a notch - I think people can handle it!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a unique brunch experience come try the big breakfast with boneless bangus. The saltiness of the fish is offset by the 2 sunnyside up eggs and lightly dressed arugula salad. What is this cassava hash?? It is amazing! Better than potato hash because it super crisp on the outside and a fluffier texture. Plus it being a root vegetable makes me feel like guilty about gobbling it all up. I suggest getting the garlic rice on the side since it's pure deliciousness and the mango mimosa.

Great friendly funny service. I love the fact that they served us lumpia upon request even though it's not available until dinner. Didn't have to wait too long for the food to come and it's fairly priced. 

I recommend this place to those looking for a different brunch experience and no line ups."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back.  We came with a voucher for dinner, and it was incredibly delicious.  We're hoping to come back and try the large sharing dishes, esp the one that smells of garlic.

Starters
- Oysters.  Baked with some coconut stuff in it.  Very tasty.
- Halo Halo Sisig and Rice.  This is like a Filipino Bibimbap.  Comes out in a sizzling cast iron pan, with a side of rice.  Mix it up.  Boom, deliciousness.

Mains
- Ginataan Gulay.  Tastiest cauliflower I've had in a long time.  Yes, has coconut.  :)
- Kare Kare.  As the oxtail dish, I had the highest of hopes of the bunch, and I quite liked it.  However, it was the least impressive of the dishes.

Dessert
Ginataan Sundae.  There are no words to describe this dessert, except awesomeness.  Truly creative and shareable (although I wanted it all for myself)."}
{"text":"I went on a Wednesday night around 7 pm; the restaurant was less than half full. I was able to get a table for one without a reservation. 

After sitting down,  I waited for more than 15 minutes with my menu and water with no service. Yes, my menu was on the table thus I was ready to order. I was really looking forward to trying the crispy pata. 

Everyone else was being served or were eating; even a table that arrive after me. Upon reading more reviews, this place is very hit or miss. The service is hit or miss. The food is hit or miss. 

I know this isn't a critique of their food but you need service to get food. Most Filipinos are very warm and friendly thus they typically make excellent host. 

So really, this may not be the place for you unless you're felling lucky that night. Not sure if I will go back since I am a out-of-town business traveler and Toronto has so much to offer."}
{"text":"This review is about the HAND TO MOUTH or \"KAMAYAN\" dinner served only on Sundays. 

Work up a solid appetite before embarking on this experience, I assure you will need assistance to get out of your protein coma after this feast. 

This dinner is undoubtedly a neat experience. The table is covered with banana leaves and the array of food is beautifully plated live on the leaves. As the name suggests, there are no plates or cutlery -  you will be eating with your hands. 

Two chefs came to our table and the presentation begun with the artistic spreading of the bagoong caramel, soy garlic puree and house made hot sauce over the leaves. The chefs proceeded to plate the remaining 10 items while simultaneously providing a short dialogue of what the food was and how it was prepared. 

The remaining 10 items included the following (ranked in order of deliciousness): 

1. FRIED CHICKEN ADOBO WINGS - marinated with a sweet and spicy dry sauce, crispy, and juicy as fried chicken should be. Colonel Sanders will have a run for his money if Lamesa ever penetrated the bucket of chicken market

2. FRIED BONELESS BANGUS - Each person gets an entire grilled and de-boned fish; fresh and well cooked

3. KARE KARE OXTAIL - Fall off the bone oxtail meat marinated in kare kare sauce (peanut butter and garlic sauce)

4. CRISPY PORK - Tender, juicy, perfectly cooked pork with crispy skin. This was an allergy substitute for the clams and mussels in coconut milk on the menu. 

5. MANGO SALAD - fresh and perfectly ripe mangos seasoned with a touch of citrus dressing

6. SISIG LETTUCE WRAPS- One lettuce with rice noodle to wrap anything on the table with. I thought the actual lettuce leaf was too small to put much in, perhaps I was just too ambitions with how much I wanted to stuff into it. 

7. TINOLA BROTH - A pallet cleanser, tasted like chicken broth

8. GRILLED CORN -  1/2 cob of sweet maize, helps balance the lack of vegetables on the table

9. UBE CORN BREAD - Purple bread, didn't get to try this as it was cooked with coconut milk (I'm allergic). My friend mentioned it was dry and not too noteworthy.

10. Rice - Heaping amount of steamed white rice to satisfy your carbohydrate needs. A bit sticky in nature and easy to eat with hands


Rating Summary: 

Food: 9/10 - average for the items noted above

Atmosphere: 10/10 -great vibe, feels similar to a family owned restaurant but more popping

Service: 9/10 - water service in check, would have liked to be seated at our reserved time (was serviced about 20 minutes after our reservation time).

The Hand to Mouth dinner is highly recommended to all those who like to 'experience' his/her food.  Fun and finger licking good (literally).  $40/ Person.  Make a reservation at least a week in advance. I recommend to try this at least once."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch a while back and it was delicious. Had the pork and pancakes and a few of their shandies. The portions were big and the prices were really affordable for brunch in the city. Service was really attentive and great as well. Can't wait to try them out for dinner."}
{"text":"- i like this place.
- dont know much about filipino food, and normally dont really like the reinvention and reimaging of ethnic food - but this place gets it right.
- fried chicken adobo? yes, please. give me more.
- bangus was amazing. small marinated fish, that's smoked, then fried.... a nice but of cured fish and when paired with the garlic rice.... hmmm.
- music is also dope. 90s hip hop and r&b. thank you.

p.s. there's a living social deal going on now for a 5 course tasting. not bad for $30! (https://www.livingsocial.com/deals/1260626-prix-fixe-dinner)"}
{"text":"My partner and I spent Valentine's day here for their Kamayan dinner. It was appropriately titled \"Balentines Day\" and for $60/person you got lobster tail, duck adobo, oxtail caldaretta, pork skewers and so much more. The ube (purple yam) cornbread was so delicious! 

A kamayan is a celebration of food and Lamesa lived up to it. Food is served on banana leaves and it almost felt like an orchestra, with two servers constantly placing food on the banana leaf and explaining what it was. When it was all over, our table was beautifully filled with garlic rice topped with delicious meats and vegetables and four sauces for us experiment with (some mild, some sweet, some veryyy spicy). You eat with your hands (and you should!)

The service was fantastic. Attentive without being overbearing. They send you home with a little takeout container of dessert (ube macaron and a chocolate truffle) - which is so in line with the culture (everytime I go to my boyfriend's house for dinner I always leave with a container of food!). 

Is it authentic? Probably not - definitely \"high end\" but a great introduction to Filipino food if you haven't had any before. There are definitely more authentic places to eat but for being a downtown spot it's great. 

It is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Upon entering Lamesa promptly with two friends at the reserved time of 6:00pm this past Saturday night, the hostess without contrition explained that our table was not quite ready and that we would simply have to wait.  This despite the restaurant not at all busy with the only other visible patrons being one large party seated at the back and empty tables throughout that could easily seat our party of three.  She then nonchalantly points to a small table adjacent to the restaurant's front window which had already been set for two people - all it could reasonably accommodate.  I don't suppose her intent was for the three of us to have to endure an uncomfortable and cramped game of 'musical plates'.  However, any reasonable person would have deduced the very likelihood of this taking place.
 
I pointed and walked over to a table for four in silent protest and the hostess did not object - perhaps recognizing the implausibility of what she had in mind initially.  She proved this not to be the case however when she immediately pronounced the caveat of us finishing our meals and out the door by 7:30pm for the next reservation. Essentially, before being physically seated, marching orders were given instructing when we were no longer welcome.  I guess our dollars would simply lose their cache after that time.
 
Finally once seated, the hostess provided only one menu and promised that she would shortly bring us a few more since they were concurrently being made downstairs in their print shop.  Not even two minutes later however, she returned to inform us that the one menu will have to be shared since their printer was broken. Now the place was less than a third full at this time, so I don't suppose she could have thought the problem through enough to simply fetch two more menus from the large party at the back who looked to have completed their orders?!?
 
Our orders were then subsequently taken by a distracted waiter who seemed to simply not know that eye contact is vital part of effectively communicating with human beings.  Looking predominantly down on his very important ipad (it might as well have been an extension of his arm), he inquired whether any of us were familiar with Filipino cuisine. I ventured to comment that I was \"Filipino\" and reasonably understood the menu offerings so I've explained a bit of it to my two companions. The waiter's haughty and phlegmatic muttered response to this: \"No one knows everything\".
 
This is a total of 3 gaffes from the hostess with a possible hint of smart-ass before cocktails from the waiter. I was beginning to silently ponder how to calculate negative 15% of something.  Now, I want to emphasize that if I were to judge the wait staff in another setting on character alone, all would probably score incredibly high - salt of the earth people trying to earn an honest living. But here I am thinking service and service skills only, and so I am not at all charitable.
 
Onto the meal itself: The restaurant features a 5 course prix-fixe meal for $30. It was delectable throughout. One of the mains was Pork adobo: pork belly that has been confit for 12 hours, fried crispy, then served with soy, vinegar and bay leaf, a smear of black garlic purée and a side of house-made chayote pickles. It was delicious and suitably decadent effused with a spicy richness inside a flawless, crunchy exterior worth savouring in and of itself.  The desserts were also a treat - particularly the Ovaltine cheesecake. The Carnation brulee evaporated milk custard exuded a subtle, creamy and velvety depth under a lightly charred and delicately sugared crust.

Note to the impatient: Each serving was accompanied by nothing less than a boring, mind-numbing and unendurable expositive harangue about the intricacies of the specialty presented. For all I cared, I just wanted to eat before the food got cold. With each course, came that beautiful moment when interest and expectancy coalesce as you see your food coming only to realize that before it actually can be eaten, one must endure yet another food disquisition.  The effort would have been more effective if it was kept short and sweet and only extended for more explanation if the diner actually requested it.

Many advise of the importance of first impressions and in the fickle world of dining out, this holds especially true.  Subsequent blunders and/or miscues in the dining experience will more likely go unnoticed or altogether forgiven based on the diner's immediate notion of being welcomed and attended to by a considerate wait staff.  Lamesa Filipino Kitchen, regardless of the 'laidback cool' vibe it seems to want to convey, should take considerable note of this."}
{"text":"I've always been interested in Filipino culture and I was excited to hear that there was a restaurant that featured traditional Filipino dishes with a twist.

My boyfriend and I came here one night to try their prix fixe menu. The server was very attentive (granted, we were the only other couple in the restaurant at that time) and knowledgeable about the menu.

For the appetizers, we had the Halo Halo Sisig & Rice, and the Bistek Tataki. The onion jam and the lemon soy dressing was such a tasteful accompaniment to the beef (which very much reminded me of beef sashimi). The sisig was very aromatic but I felt it may have been a little more dry than I would've liked.

I had ordered the Short Rib Kaldereta, but was offered an ox tail alternative instead because they were out of short ribs. I regret not writing the details of this dish down because it was delicious!

The most memorable dish of the night was the Crispy Pork Belly Adobo. They weren't kidding when they called this dish crispy. There was such a nice ratio of crunch and fat and meat to the pork belly. And when you throw in the adobo reduction? W-o-w. That's definitely a dish that will keep me coming back for more.

One of the tasting courses (pre-dessert) were Banana-Q's (I hope I spelt that right). It's pretty much a carmelized banana on a skewer, a common street food in the Philippines. I really enjoyed this treat because like the crispy pork belly, the level of crunch on the banana-Q was spectacular!

We finished off with a Nutella Whipped Cheesecake and from what I can remember, a Jackfruit Sorbet/Ice Cream. The cheesecake was a little too rich for my taste, but the ice cream was very refreshing.

Overall, we had such an enjoyable meal and we were pleasantly surprised with each dish that was brought out. I strongly recommend coming here for their prix fixe menu!"}
{"text":"We went there last Friday night, had a totally awesome experience...
The food was absolutely delicious, and the service couldn't be better. 

We got there at around 8:08pm for a 8:00pm reservation, the place was packed and the table was waiting for us. All the staffs were really friendly and each one of them really made us feel very welcomed. 

We had the 5 course prix fixe menu, and each course was presented with a detail description. The servers really took the time to made sure everything was ok throughout dinner.

Will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"Just got back from an incredible hand-to-mouth dinner at Lamesa. 

From the sauces, to the rice, to all the food that followed, everything was just right. The awesome staff and the way the food is presented makes it an experience you won't forget! We had the Halo Halo for dessert - what a treat! 

Great place for a night out with friends. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"You know how you have a reliable restaurant that is delicious? It may not be the BEST but you know every time you go you're gonna get yummy food?

That is Lamesa. I've taken over a dozen people, and every single one has found this place delicious.

Honestly - all of it is really yummy. DEFINITELY get the garlic rice :)"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a long time. My partner is Filipino, and his mother has tried making me vegetarian versions of some of the dishes, but they've never quite been satisfying. So when I saw this restaurant when we were in Toronto, I said we had to try it.

Service was prompt and very friendly. We ordered the mushroom steak, tuna kinilaw, and Salmon sinigang. The mushroom dish was one of the best preparations of mushrooms I've ever had (and I love mushrooms!). Perfectly cooked and spiced, and with a very well balanced broth that paired nicely with the barley in the dish. The kinilaw had a perfect balance of citrus, spice, and richness from the avocado. The sinigang was similarly fantastic. My partner also had the halo halo, which he said was amazing (I don't have a sweet tooth). He said the cinnamon added a little bit of spice and flair to the dish, but it still retained all the flavors from the traditional halo halo that he loved.

My partner says that he has traditionally always thought of Filipino food as comfort food, but not as high-end food. He said these dishes maintained enough of the traditional flavors to satisfy his craving for that, but added new and bold flavors as well. He agreed that this was one of the best meals he's had in a long time. The owners both checked in on how we liked the meal, and were very friendly, chatting with us for a while. It's too bad we were just visiting Toronto, otherwise we would be back here frequently!"}
{"text":"Came here for Kamayan for my bday dinner. Food was so delicious. There was garlic rice, pork belly lettuce wraps, adobo wings, coconut mussels, ribs, grilled corn and eggplant, ube cornbread. Everyone had an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"As my Filipino wife was pestering me to try this place, we finally went for our wedding anniversary & opted for the 11+ course tasting menu.   I'm generally not a huge fan of Filipino food (usually running in the opposite direction), but I would gladly come back to this place again.

The tasting course price is not cheap, but would say it's well worth the money.  We started with 6 courses of very creative appetizers, each being a delicious & generous portion....Deconstructed bangus fish taco was awesome!  The 2 lovely mains that followed seemed like normal order portions (which is huge for a tasting menu).  We were completely stuffed by then, so not sure if they would have brought out more mains if we were still hungry.  They finished with the 2 desserts on their menu + halo halo!

Overall, dinner was just under 3 hours from start to finish...so just make sure you have adequate time & good company :)"}
{"text":"I want to start off this review by saying I actually had no intention to eat here, but we stumbled across this place waiting for our table for 416 Snack Bar.  I'm glad we did, because this place was some of the best Filipino food I've had on par with the best in Mississauga.  We got in here during the peak of dinner time and still managed to get a table.

Our server was super friendly and took the time to explain everything on the menu.  We also told him we were in a rush (waiting for our table at 416), and he assured us the food would come out quickly and they would make sure we were on time.  We quickly ordered a small meal to share consisting of the Lechon Kiwali and the Sisig.  The pork belly slices of the Lechon Kiwali were supremely good, they just sort of melted in your mouth like butter.  I know the fat content was high, but I couldn't resist finishing every last bite.  The sisig, looked better in yelp photos, than what we got IRL.  It was aight though, a little dry and small portioned, but we still ate it all up.

Overall, great service, good food and cool atmosphere.  The place reminds me of restaurants downtown in NYC as the decor and lighting make it work.  I'll definitely be coming back here for more pork belly in the future.  You don't win friends with salad."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner on a Friday night around 6:30pm. We did not have a reservation and we're lucky to get a spot at the bar to eat. By 7pm they were turning people away.  The food was excellent. It's filipino with a modern flair. Everything from the duck limpia to the salmon to the ube flan was thoughtfully prepared and presented.  I want to go back for the Sunday kamayan brunch! A must try!"}
{"text":"Came here with my group of friends on a Friday night and their small dining room was packed. It was our first time there so we got an order of almost everything on the menu.

My group absolutely love their fragrant garlic fried rice and it goes well with everything on the menu. The crispy pork belly and tuna kinilaw were generally like. But the trout and flat iron steak were a hit. I'd definitely recommend these for anyone. Each dish has its own special sauce and they just taste heavenly with your garlic rice. I also loved the egg noodle (GINATAAN), it was a bit spicy but so very tasty. I love vibrant flavors and every dish here gave me just that. You can feel the passion the owners have for their food when you look at how each of the dish was carefully crafted and when your server explains your dish to you.

Besides San Miguel (a famous Asian beer), they also have fruit juice imported from the Philipines. These taste very differently from North American juice and if you don't mind the sugar content, you should definitely give it a try. I personally love the Philipino key lime juice. If you love it, by the way, you can get the same juice at T&T.

The restaurant offers a very friendly and relaxing atmostphere, our servers were all very sweet and attentive which made the exprience even more perfect.

As impressed as we were of the food, we didn't really like any of the desserts. Cost per person were $38 (no alcoholic drinks) and I think it's a great price point for such uniqueness and dedication."}
{"text":"PROS:
I am typically a big fan of Lamesa because I am a huge fan of ube, and I have headed to Lamesa before just for their original ube custard flan. I went with a girlfriend of mine, and she had the squash Arroz  Caldo congee with egg which was very flavorful! It was a lovely warm dish on a cold winter day with soft texture, miso and squash flavors topped with an egg. I had the corned beef lumpia, which was slightly small as a portion for its price, but had great crunch with a salty beef brisket punch. Of course we finished with the ube leche flan wth came with a neat sprinkle of puffed rice and grapes.

Con:
-somewhat small portion for price
- non-food-related BIG CON SAFETY - the STAIRS to the washroom are deathly. They are steep and especially DANGEROUS when we were there in the winter weather. We watched 2 ppl fall down the stairs audibly - not just a few steps but the most of the flight. There were absolutely no wet floor signs or warning at all. After the first fall we observed we told the server, to which she kinda laughed and ?giggled and said \"I know, you gotta watch out\". When we saw (and heard) the 2nd person fall, we were much more concerned - and this time alerted a second server - also hinting that this could easily be a lawsuit. After this, they wrote a hand-drawn sign to \"Watch your step\". It was reasonable however, I avoided using the washroom for my whole dinner - especially because I am currently very very pregnant and that was quite difficult!!

Despite enjoying the food thoroughly, I think this establishment should take the safety of the patrons more seriously."}
{"text":"So I walk into Lamesa after reading a killer review on Blog To because it came up on my Facebook feed.

Not a bad looking spot.  The interior is a bit of a small seating area with the kitchen in back, which is pretty typical of the restaurants in this area.  The overall ambiance is inviting and intimate.  The candles are a nice touch.

The server introduced me to the various items on the menu and explained what the dishes consisted of and the ingredients.  Many of which are indigenous to the Philippines.  Interesting as it was, the menu was rather limited with less variety than I was expecting.

The servers are exceptional and will go out of their way to make you feel at home and answer any questions you may have.

I ordered the pork belly adobo, which was pretty delicious, however the portion size was entirely too small.  For $18 I expected alot more.  In fact, I wasn't even close to full after finishing, so if you're starving before you order, then forget about it.  The side order of halo halo was EXTREMELY delicious.  Masarap!!!  It seemed more filling than the main adobo course however, which was a bit disappointing.

Overall I would say that this is a great place to eat if you're looking to try out newer renditions of Filipino classics and have some money you want to get rid of.  I myself was looking forward to some classic and authentic Filipino cuisine, which you won't find here.  Lamesa can't be faulted for this because they don't market themselves as a classic Filipino restaurant. 

Walking out of Lamesa into the biting November wind I felt like I'd spent alot of money, was still a bit hungry, but felt that I had been treated very well and respectfully by the server.  Would I go back again?  No for now.  If they introduced some less pretentious fare and broadened their menu to include some basic classics, there's no doubt I'd be back ready to stuff myself to the brim.  The service is the best part of the restaurant.  Not that the food was awful, in fact it was quite good.  It's the value that's lacking...low portion size and high price loses points for this reviewer.  Magandang gabi for now po."}
{"text":"Had the Kamayan \"hand-to-mouth\" service with our friends and four kids at Lamesa Filipino Kitchen on Sunday night. $40 for adults and $10 for kids. The meal is served on banana leaves on the table. The food was artfully laid out by the servers which was a nice touch. The adults received a salad with calamasi dressing, lettuce wrap with crunchy pork, devilled egg, garlic fried rice, fried chicken (wing) adobo, tender pork rib, milkfish, grilled eggplant and broccoli, and a piece of pandan pudo (rice cake). The kids got the fried rice, chicken adobo and broccoli. The portions were generous and pandan pudo was a hit with the kids. Definitely a fun experience for everyone."}
{"text":"Being familiar with Filipino food I was excited to dine at a Filipino restaurant. Located in Queen West's redeveloping trendy neighborhood, Lamesa's decor is modern, reflective of their fusion approach to preparing traditional Filipino food. The service at Lamesa was good; never had to ask for water or drink refills. The restaurants attempt at up scale dining was displayed through an attempt by staff to introduce the plates upon presentation and explain the respective preparations however the waiter was not familiar with the dishes and had to keep referring back to the menu to spark his memory. The menu is small, offering the patron a choice between a five course tasting menu or a la carte. The tasting menu options were good but nothing that I wouldn't be able to prepare at home, and the a la carte salmon choice was had a distinct \"fishy\" taste. The wine selections were nice however the liquor drinks were pricey, averaging $12.95. Overall it was nice but I would not return nor recommend to friends."}
{"text":"This place is cute. The art on the wall and the small intimate set-up right down the cute waitress (who my girlfriend fell in love with her beauty). 

We came here for brunch and our first experience of Filipino food. We went with the Adobo chicken and the Silog breakfast with boneless bangus (which is a milk fish). The Silog breakfast was a really good fried fish nothing special but both meals came with a good size portion of garlic fried rice (which was delish). The eggs were slightly over on both dishes. We also shared ensaymada French toast. Suffice it to say we got greedy and ordered too much food for two people. The French toast was the highlight and the downfall. It ate sweet, salty, and tart. It was a great balance of bold flavours. I would recommend it but not after a whole other breakfast. We were both so full that for the next 3-4 hours we continued to taste the French toast. 

The overall feel was that the dishes are a great value and good introduction into perhaps a filipino breakfast. Would love to come back here for the dinner menu or Kamayan."}
{"text":"The attentive service was what made the faults acceptable with this dining experience. I have to give them credit since they had a very large group of what appeared to be 30 ppl or two groups of 15 right beside one another. Everyone was working together and the positive attitudes of the staff went a long way, but overall, the experience was not as enjoyable at the first visit there.

 We made a reservation for 8:30 and were seated right next to the bar. The tables are pretty close together and cramped at the best of times, but being sandwiched between the bar and the large group was a little much for me since I have claustrophobia issues. Dining out in Toronto becomes more and more challenging for me every year.
It took a little while for someone to get a drink order from us, but we started off with the Tequila cocktail from their list. It was refreshing and bitter. My friend ordered the price fixe and I had the a la carte as I'm not usually a fan of sweets. I had the sausage spring roll and it was kind of cold. My friend's first amuse bouche was a spring roll as well. This was also cold. The calamari in coconut milk was tasty, but again, not very hot. I do get that they were busy.
When our mains came out cold, we figured it was only fair to send them back-- Four our own sakes us as well as so that the restaurant could ensure quality control. They weren't eating the food so they wouldn't have any idea that it wasn't hot enough.
They staff were really nice about this and while we were sitting with nothing in front of us, another server came by and inquired with genuine concern about where out food was. When we mentioned that it had not been hot, he, too went to the kitchen to look in on it for us. 

When our food returned, it was piping hot and quite good. The flank steak was juicy and tender. The portions were much smaller than I remembered them being and the pork belly, which last time, had been so delicious that i almost cried, was a bit dry and not as succulent.

The staff were so lovely, and even though I declined dessert, they brought these crispy little pastry chips with honey on them. They were yummy. My friend's dessert was a deconstructed mascarpone cheesecake, and it was tasty.

Next time I return to Lamesa, I will ask ahead if there are any big groups coming in. I really felt that while the servers had the front line that the kitchen was really slamed and the food quality definitely suffered. However, when we pointed out the problems, they dealt with them swiftly and effectively.

Overall the wait time between courses were a little exhausting. The food was good, and the service was excellent. They really want their customers to be happy and this is why I will be returning."}
{"text":"Great take on filipino food. Good place to eat for both those familiar and not familiar with filipino food. Good service and friendly servers. Servers were knowledgeable about the food and were happy to describe it and answer any questions. A bit small portion sizes but a great place to share many plates. Price was so-so."}
{"text":"Had brunch here one Saturday with my husband and some friends. I had the Silog Breakfast with sausage (longganisa), garlic fried rice, cassava hash and 2 fried eggs. It was super yummy! The sausages were so tasty and had a surprisingly delicate texture. The dish came with 2 pieces only...not enough...they were sooo good that my husband kept eating off of my plate. The eggs were cooked to perfection and the garlic rice was not oily at all. The combination of flavors and textures on this dish was heavenly! 

My husband got the corned beef cheek and it was also very tasty and tender but I wouldn't trade it for my Silog dish. One of my friends got the grilled chicken Adobo dish and she said it was okay.

Their portions were on the tiny side. My husband said he could eat 2 servings of my dish and I can too!"}
{"text":"Near and dear to my heart gets you five stars! 
Before starting this review I must say that I am related to the awesome owner Ben, mind you I haven't seen him since a family get together maybe 25 plus years ago. We didn't get any special treatment - but he insisted we have all of the nine items on the Summerlicous menu! 
Judging was very hard on Lamesa, for a couple of reasons - I'm not a big fan of fusion anything, sometimes it's just too weird and I don't know what the food was originally supposed to taste like. Second factor was - yeah I know this guy, his whole family is in the restaurant business, I'm sure it's going to be good - biggest understatement of the night. 
We came in a little early for our reservation - waited a bit by the bar until we were greeted, you could see that they were super busy. It's an intimate place, I wouldn't say it was good for groups, but they did have a couple of larger parties that night. The decor was warm with a nice Filipino mural near the front, nothing overbearing.  
Now, the food - amazing and very impressed! 
For starters Sisig, Pancit and Grilled Talong. Each item equally different and prepared perfectly, the Talong ( Asian Eggplant ) was the standout for me l, grilled and seasoned perfectly. They added a few things to the original preparation of the dish, but I have to say it did not take away from how I have always known this dish to taste. 
The Mains, Fried Bangus - now for all the Filipinos out there, Bangus is a pain in the ass to eat with many small bones, but it is very flavorful fish, Lamesa has this on point - daing style (marinated in vinegar, soy and lemon) deboned and crispy deep fried with the head on!! We devoured that thing head and all! Grilled Chicken Adobo - had a beautiful \"inasal\" flavor to it. The winner for me was the Ginataan Gulay, with the near and dear factor!! The ginataan munngo (to cook in coconut milk) were so authentic I could have sworn my mother made it! The fried cauliflower was a nice surprise to the dish, Filipinos don't usually cook this veggie, but Lamesa made it work! 
Desserts - Ube Flan - out of this world creamy - kudos to the person creaming this out on the double boiler! 
Lanka Cake - think Bibinka and Lanka had a child!! 
Fruit Salad Panna Cotta - think Filipino Fruit Salad and Jello jiggly goodness! 
I'm very impressed with Lamesa, they have take Filipino food to the next level, keeping the cuisine true to form and turning it into something great without sacrificing the way the food should taste!"}
{"text":"I went there last week with a group of 5 of us for a friend's birthday.  I've never had Filipino food before - and people stop getting so wound up.  There is no \"Fliipino food\", there are 10 million islands and 80 million people there, it's diverse.  What they've done is take some popular, classic dishes, popular flavours and put their own spin on them.  
Between all of us we tried a good variety of items.  The spring rolls and halo halo sisig are amazing.  I enjoyed my lamb dish and my friends enjoyed their fried chicken.  The flavours really pop in these dishes and the food is fresh.  If you are stuck in the Italian/French food rut I'd recommend this place, it is very unique and has some great things to try.  Service was good as well, I did appreciate the backstory on the food although that's not everyone's cup of tea."}
{"text":"Came here based on the reviews and really wanted to try some modernized Filipino food. 

Service: Casual and friendly

Ambiance: Laidback, small.

Food: 3.5/5 ... ~$20 for a small meat entree that feeds one... then you have to order rice on the side at an extra cost. If you're someone like me that needs the veggies as well to really complete your meal, that's another $8-15 to your bill. Taste-wise, the food was good. Presentation was great. But based on the food and price - I don't think it was worth it. 

I had the beef brisket - came in the delicious broth which when well when dunked into rice.
Also had the eggplant which was supposed to be a restaurant favorite - I wasn't a fan. The charred eggplant wasn't for me. Still feeling hungry... I ordered the adobo chicken. 3 pieces of boneless chicken thighs coated in nicely balanced sauce - I was finally full. 

I also ordered the LoLo Cool J - was yummy. 

In total, for two people we spent $102 which was pretty steep considering this was supposed to be a casual night out. 

I would like to come back again to try other items sometime in the future though."}
{"text":"We came here as a group and ordered the chef choice meal. Each course was served as a sharing dish. The food was tasty and some creative in design. However, the portions ended up being small. Some of us definitely left with lots of room in our stomachs. 

As well, I understood we were a group on a Friday night, but I really wished the servers were a bit more diligent in bringing us water and grabbing our drink orders in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"Staff were very helpful explaining the intricacies of the dishes.  Overall a bit overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"PROS: Rockstar Filipino cuisine and attentive service. Casual. Nice 90's R&B playing in background. Young, hip clientele. Super-cool staff. 

CONS: Tiny, tiny, venue with limited seating. Busy, which is not really a con since the food is the guilty culprit.

Lamesa was not my 1st rodeo with Filipino cuisine, having been introduced to these exotic flavours at the family gatherings of my ex.  But, despite my familiarity, I must concede that the food at Lamesa is simply inspired.

TOP PICKS:

* CRISPY CHICARRON: Can feel my arteries hardening, but damn good.
* LUMPIA: Dee-lish (could eat this app as my entree) 
* CHICKEN ADOBO: Perfectly prepared spicy chicken sitting atop bed of risotto.
* LOLO COOL J: Nirvana in a glass. Not ashamed to admit that I ordered 2 of these so-called \"girly\" drinks. Wait till you taste the bourbon-soaked pineapple.

The service at Lamesa is top-notch. The servers are true gastronomes. Each waiter takes the time to explain each dish in intricate detail. With surgical precision. Each dish is de-constructed down to a molecular level, so that you understand the time and love that went into the masterpiece you are about to consume.  Like a salute to the dying. You cannot help but leave with a true appreciation for the passion of the chefs.

Will return fo' shizzell !"}
{"text":"There Kamayan is a great experience, but the hidden gem is the brunch!  Great flavours and cocktails to match!"}
{"text":"Tried out this eatery as a group of eight and after hearing months and months of great word-of-mouth, it was so worth it!  First off, it's a small venue so definitely book a reservation to not be disappointed.  Parking on Queen Street is a challenge and we luckily found metre street parking right across.  We all went for the silog entrees; I myself chose the pork longanisa and it was heaven!  The fusion of good ol' hearty eggs, interesting dense cassava hash, greens and garlic rice made for a very satisfying brunch!  Price is quite reasonable for a Filipino entree.  Calamansi juice topped it off quite nicely.  Only downside is our table was seated next to the stairs leading down to the washrooms and that characteristic smell definitely emanated upstairs.  Perhaps installing a door would be a good touch.  Overall, highly recommended...but maybe not next to those basement stairs!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was spot on! 

And Sundays they do a special where they roll out a chef's delight of assorted food that's all delicious and a Filipino culinary experience, where you do not receive silverware (unlike all other nights at this great spot) rather you eat with your hands as they do in some parts of the country this fine establishment hails from. 

Overall I highly recommend this place and if you are in the mood for a culinary adventure try it on a Sunday. 

And if you are looking for delicious Filipino cooked food try it and day of the week. 

The service is fantastic and the food Is even better."}
{"text":"This is a great place for  a twist on Filipino food rather than traditional Filipino dishes. The whole family loved it! My brother had the Sarsi sticky ribs which was a good portion size and something he really enjoyed. My parents had Crispy Pata and garlic rice. They were surprised at how great it was haha.  We also had banana fried which sounded strange to me, but it is a must order! I'm vegan, and I had the ginataan gulay which was amazing!  The service here is very good. The hostess went in to detail about the restaurant and what was in every dish. The staff and the customers  are all pretty chill which makes the place feel relaxing. I recommend this place for friends and for dates.  I'll be back soon! I took off a star because it's a bit pricey.  The bathroom could also use a bit more cleaning."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious (prix fix dinner for $25). Atmosphere inside is lovely - classy but has a homey feel with all the wooden furniture. Service was fantastic - we were seated at the bar, so were being served on by the lady behind the bar. She was so nice and helpful.

On to the food. I did sharesies so tried two of each course on the summerlicious menu:

Appetizers:
Charred eggplant - this dish was just ok. Tasted like fried eggplant with some interesting tasting toppings.
Sisig - flavour was good. Rice wasn't mushy, but I would've liked if the rice had a little less water content.

Mains:
Chicken adobo - this was really good. Chicken was oh so tender! And the asparagus was a really nice touch.
Fried bangus - this is a fried white fish. Really enjoyed the orange sauce and sides (esp the potato). My friend thought the fish was a bit dry, but I thought it was good.

Desserts: (now THIS is where I was super impressed)
Langka cake - ahhhh so delicious. Moist cake with rhubarb and coconut whip. Try this!
Ube leche flan - absolutely delightful. I think the waiter said this was a purple yam based flan? Can't remember, but it was amazing. I've never tasted any dessert like this before. The flan went perfectly with the apple tapioca and the rice crispies...Try this too!!!

I'd come back just for the desserts. While the apps and mains didn't stand out to me, they were still really well done."}
{"text":"So, so good. Get the tasting menu for just enough food without feeling like you'll explode. Everything was wonderful, and those in our party who don't love super-spicy food we're happy to find that the food was flavorful and not just \"hot\" as a flavor: in fact, not really spicy at all, with few exceptions. I loved that the menu pushed me a bit out of my comfort zone in terms of a few ingredients, but I liked or loved every dish. We ate every morsel of every plate."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for summerlicious and was blow away by the meal. The were 3 of us, so we ordered one of each appetizer, entree and dessert to share. 

Out of the 3 appetizers, I really like the sisig. It was mixed pork with chicken gizzard on a sizzling plate with a sunny side up egg and spicy mayo. Rice came with it on the side. The texture was very interesting and the portion was actually a bit large for appetizer. I ranked the eggplant second, as it was beautifully plated, even though it was a bit bland. The last on the list is the pancit, which was kind of like the korean chap jae, and nothing special. 

For the entree, the chicken adobo was amazing! The chicken was so tender and juicy, while the vegetable underneath was also very good. The deep fried cauliflower with mungbeans underneath and coconut foam on the top was also very interesting. There are 3 pieces so it worked out perfectly for the 3 of us. The last dish was the bangu fish, which was little dry and tasted a bit fishy. However, the tomato sauce underneath the fish was very appetizing. I probably wouldn't order te fish next time.

All 3 desserts were really really good. The jackfruit cake was a little mor chewy than regular cake, and te coconut mousse tha came with it matched the cake very well. The panda cotta had a very rich condensed milk taste, which I liked. And my favourite dish if the evening is the ube flan!!!! This is sort of like a purple yam mousse with white tapioca on top and a sprinkle of rice krispy. It was rich and creamy and literally melts in your mouth. The dessert is must order item!!

We were ver satisfied with the meal and would come back soon!"}
{"text":"Well, my first experience with Filipino cuisine was quite a positive one, thanks to Lamesa!  First off, for someone like me who loves trying as many things as possible, a tasting menu is a wonderful thing.  And when it's only about $10 more than a main course a la carte, why wouldn't you go for it?  You get five courses, but two of those are just little tasters.  Still plenty of value for $35.  

You start off with an amuse bouche, which for two of us was a pork empanada that was very flaky and almost sweet.  Not amazing to my tastes, but quite good.  The pescetarian in our party was offered a smoked white fish of some sort, which she enjoyed.  Kudos to the waitress for making sure she was given something she could eat.  For the \"pulutan\" course, I tried the shrimp pancit canton.  The noodles were thicker than I usually prefer, but they were actually very tasty.  I'm used to thick noodles feeling kind of slimy, but these definitely didn't.  My DCs ordered the other two options, the Halo Halo Sisig and the Green Mango Salad.  Everyone seemed very happy with their appetizers.  

For the \"Ulam\" main course, I ordered the short rib Nilaga and my DCs both ordered the Ginataan Gulay.  I definitely recommend the Nilaga - wow.  The beef came away easily with a fork and melted in my mouth.  The marrow mashed potatoes were fantastic, and the green beans were nice and crisp.  My only complaint was the broth that it was served in - it was tasty enough, but it didn't serve much purpose to me and it actually melted away some of those delicious potatoes!  The main complaint about the Ginataan was that it was mostly green beans and not as much squash as expected.  However on the upside, both agreed that the small piece of eggplant it was served with was the best eggplant they'd ever tasted.  So, pluses and minuses. 

The pre-dessert was presented to us as a sorbet, but it was really a drink (perhaps it was the heat?)  It was very refreshing and a nice palate cleanser before we moved onto dessert.  I had the Maple Leche Flan and my DCs both tried the plantain spring rolls.  The Flan wasn't as cloyingly sweet as I had worried, it was nice and balanced.  Very light and very tasty.  The spring rolls received praise as well, and apparently the ice cream they were served with was fantastic.

As for the atmosphere, it's a small restaurant but doesn't feel claustrophobic, even when it was completely full.  The service was great, our server was very friendly and attentive and described every dish to us and suggested the best ways to eat them.  

All in all, I definitely recommend this restaurant and hope to visit again soon.  Try the Nilaga and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My Husband has been wanting to take me here for forever!

The moment we walked thru the door, I knew I was in for a treat!  We opted for the Pri-Fixe Menu and were butter in the chairs.  It's one of those meals that you bring a talker to, because the moment the food touches their lips, you don't hear a peep out of them!  The flavors, I'll just say it was a party in my mouth!  The service as well as seeing the chef a few times to explain the party that was about to happen in my mouth was a delight!  There's nothing here that would disappoint anyone!  Just an overall pleasure, and great datenight with my Hubby!"}
{"text":"I was looking around Yelp for a good new restaurant for us to try Downtown. Since TIFF was going on, I didn't really go for restaurants in the high traffic areas. Alas found Lamesa Filipino Kitchen! As A Filipino, I was surprised to see another Filipino restaurant and I was excited to see what the place is all about!

The decor and mood was really nice! It felt very trendy, casual and \"hipster\" :D Lots of artwork on the walls and friendly vibe. The service was really good and the servers know stuff about the food. When they take out the food and serve it to you, they explain a little about the dish and what \"modern\" twist they added to the dish.

The food was excellent! it all felt new and yet somewhat familiar to classic Filipino food. They don't have that much of a variety on the menu, but hey! They have the classic dishes. We ordered the Chicken Adobo, Duck Lumpia, Ginataan(Veggies), Pork Inasal, Halo-Halo and Ube Leche Flan. The Chicken Adobo was really good! chicken was nicely cooked, skin was crispy and the added Chimichurri adds a nice layer to the whole thing. One of our favourites from what we had was the Ginataan, which was mixed vegetables cooked with coconut milk. This dish had the veggies and Ube Cornbread at the bottom. The Ube Cornbread was REALLY creamy and it just melted in your mouth, add that the delicious vegetables and the sweetness of the corn then you have this awesome dish! The only thing we were kinda \"meh\" on was the Pork Inasal, it tasted a little dry and we felt it needed more sauce. But, other than that! Everything felt and tasted authentic but with their own twist of modern and interesting flavors.

we'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about their tasting menu and emailed them to ask if they were able to do a vegetarian one for us as we were going to be in TO for a few days.  I had good communication Witt them and they seemed excited to accomodate.  On the day of the reservation, we had something come up and had to reschedule for the next day.  Again, they seemed fine with it and said they'd reschedule no problem.  
When we showed up the next night, they did not have our reservation.  It was not busy at all, so we were able to get a table, but they have exactly one item on the menu that passes as vegetarian and it was a weird cold to barely warm temperature and bland.  My husband said her pork skin and quail was good, though.  
I know Filipino food is meat heavy which is why I haven't really tried it thus far and Lamesa definitely did not deliver as I hoped."}
{"text":"Had the Kamayan experience this past Sunday with a group of friends and I highly recommend it. Everything about the dinner experience was great. 

Our servers were always attentive, warm, and accommodating of our large group. 

The food itself looked, and tasted, really good. As someone who grew up in the Philippines, it's exciting to be able to experience Filipino food reinvented in a way that honours their traditional flavours while putting a new twist on them. The kamayan aspect itself brings back memories and it's a great way to experience Filipino food how Filipinos have long enjoyed it.

It was one of the best meals I've had in a while, and I'm looking forward to coming back to have it again."}
{"text":"Ate at Lamasa for a winterlicious meal last night:

Service: Excellent service. Our server was friendly and made it a point to explain the different ingredients in all dishes. Unlike some establishments offering winterlicious menus, we didn't feel rushed. Overall very relaxed dining experience.

Atmosphere: Lively with good mainstream music playing in the background. This place is perfect for a date or when out with friends (smaller groups due to size constraints) 

Food: Mango salad was refreshing, Chicken adobe fell of the bone and had an exciting diversity of flavors. For desert, the warm bread pudding was a treat in this cold weather! 

I can't think of any reason not to give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Wow. This place blew me away. It's quite small, and has a very island feel to it (in terms of decor). Like a little oasis in the midst of a busy city. The minute we walked in, we were seated (without having a reservation). Practically all the staff came up to see if we knew how the menu worked (some-what \"family\" style aka sharing) or if we had any questions about the dishes and if we had any allergies. We chose to share an app, main and side dish (although it's recommended that you get as many main dishes as people eating). It is pricey, and we just wanted a quick bite, so we chose to share everything.
We got glasses of calamansi juice (which is like little lemons) and the duck lumpia to start. Right away I was in gastro heaven. The lumpia comes with spots of mustard and banana ketchup as dipping sauces. Then our bistek tagalog and zucchini ginataan came out. The steak was delightful, esp paired with the sweet onion/shallots on the dish. The zucchini was something else entirely. It had ube crumbs and this coconut froth... it was incredible. I will be the first to tell you that zucchini is not my favourite veggie (although I've been warming up to it of late), and if I could eat it in this form all the time... I would totally put it to the top of my favourite veggies list!
Overall an amazing establishment. I love the modern, more gastro, take on traditional Filipino dishes. I love the service (which was super friendly and helpful). I don't love the prices as much, but for a once in awhile thing, I can handle it. I will say this, if you're looking for the more traditional, family-style establishment, this probably isn't your joint. Family-style implies that you get a lot of food that can be easily shared in large groups for affordable pricing. This place encourages sharing, but is not a family-style restaurant. It's still worth a visit! We've been thinking about this meal since we left (which probably means we shall be back again soon)!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this little gem of a place! Great authentic food with a twist and a cute/cozy Brooklynesque vibe. Overall great meal and unique cocktails. If I'm ever back in Toronto...I am for sure coming back!"}
{"text":"After reading a glowing review in the Globe and Mail we had high expectations for our first time eating Filipino food and we were not disappointed.  We loved the \"Eat with your Hands\" experience offered on Sunday.  Different chefs brought and explained each food item as we watched them paint dipping sauces on bannana leaves and create a beautiful display of food as we waited to devour the delicacies.   And the food was as good as it looked.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have tried Lamesa's brunch, but was saving for an occasion to try the Sunday evening kamayan. Kamayan is hand to mouth and what Lamesa is serving you is an experience, depth, and presentation. For $40/person you get a decent spread on banana leaves. The chefs will personally lay it out for you one by one and explain to you what's what. Think of it like a Filipino omakase, if that makes any sense. 

There was garlic rice, lots of super delicious protein like lechon kawali (crispy pork belly), pork inasal (ribs), and bangus (milkfish). My favorite was the mussels and the pork inasal.. The meat just melts off the bone! Mmm..super. The special sauces I forget, because there were several. The chefs drizzled it on the banana leaves with flair and style. I think one was a mango spicy sauce because it was sour and had a kick at the same time.

To compare to Tinuno's 15 dollars kamayan. I would say Tinuno is more bang for your buck however delicious nonetheless. But if you feel like splurging and are looking for something a little more different, Lamesa's kamayan is the way to go. 

Really had a wonderful experience, and I would 100% recommend this to anyone looking for a different dining experience."}
{"text":"Filling a long neglected gap in Toronto's vast culinary diaspora. Lamesa treads where no trendy resto have gone before by elevating down home Filipino cuisine to delicious and elegant heights.  There are other Filipino restos in the city of varying quality but most fall under the casual or buffet family style of eats.  It's fun to explore to find which does the best in particular dish or sample from the vast steaming pots but  their typically remote locations makes that a challenge.  Lamesa brings all that goodness to the downtown core and we are all the better for it.

You are met with a friendly and jovial place.  High on the lively atmosphere and low on the attitude.  This is a good thing.  The cheery staff does a bang up job to explain what the dishes are and are more than attentive.

Have the tasting menu to get a good cross section of cuisine at hand or choose your favourite from the main dishes.

Standout for me was the sisig.  Sisig is typically a grease laden sizzling platter of porky goodness best served with copious amounts of beer.  Lamesa does it one better by removing much of greasy badness while preserving all the full goodness of the pork bits. 

Pork belly adobo is \"Confit-ed\" over a day and then warmed over before being served along with a side  cup of savoury-sour-sweet sauce -  what emerges is nothing short of damn-freakin-tasty and worth a trip just for this alone!  

This place does all of us Toronto a foodies a tremendous favour by elevating and introducing the real down home goodness of Filipino cuisine adding yet another tile to the vast mosaic of Toronto cuisine.  Well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Perfect brunch spot for Mother's Day!

I called in to make a reservation for a large group of 7 a week before, but on the day of, they were able to happily accommodate for our lateness due to traffic arriving there. Once seated, we were confronted by a friendly, attentive server who met our requests punctually. Food took around 10 minutes to come out, but their mimosas and calamansi juices ($8 and $4 respectively) were great refreshers to hold us over. For the main course, I had the chicken adobo--a great contemporary take with tender, succulent chicken breasts seasoned to be tangy and flavourful like the traditional Filipino dish. The side of garlic rice was a great filler companion to the dish, and altogether the meal was very affordable with the dish being $12. The ambience itself was hip, not too loud, but family-oriented for my occasion as well. 

Would definitely be returning for more with friends next time. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great Filipino food with a twist. Price is average for the location. If you have ever wanted to try Filipino food with a contemporary twist, head to Lamesa. Great service and a fun experience. Each dish we ordered was super."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Excellent service, great tasting food, unique menu items, awesome value and laid back vibe. Lamesa is my official go-to brunch and dinner spot. Have been here a couple times and the staff here deserve major kudos - incredibly consistent even when its really busy.

If you haven't been here yet - definitely recommended. The garlic fried rice is served as a side to many dishes...every rice lovers dream. If you visit for brunch, don't miss the french toast."}
{"text":"This place is pricey for the food that you get. We ordered 3 dishes and the waitress forgot to order our 3rd dish. Instead of apologizing, she pretended that the kitchen made a mistake and quickly re-ordered our food. By then, it was 30mins later as the restaurant was full. I gave stars for the taste and presentation of the food, but please be warned, it's pricey. Probably won't go back again."}
{"text":"Just like every other yuppie, I adore brunch, but this place offers a fresh take on brunch with traditional Filipino and Filipino inspired offerings. 

This place isn't breaming with the brunch-obsessed crowds that most brunch restaurants will see, which is nice because you don't have to wait an hour just to sit down at a table. 

They have a simple menu, but just enough options to satisfy any kind of craving. I went with the chicken adobo while my friend got the silog breakfast. Unlike most brunch places you probably won't leave here feeling groggy from the egregious amount of fat you'd usually consume at brunch. We planned on sharing the French toast as well, but we were too full from our initial order to eat anymore. 

The decor here is charming and makes it a great place to take a date or a meal out with friends. Service is also awesome. I'll definitely be coming back for dinner one day."}
{"text":"This place has yet to disappoint. Gone twice and loved almost every dish, nothing was bad, we just had favorites!  I am new to Filipino food so I like to let the servers recommend what we should eat. Go with friends and share multiple plates."}
{"text":"Great tasty meal, the prefix was very worth it. I had the pork belly, the tartar and creme burlee. Though in my opinion the beef cheek my friend ordered is definitely the best bang for the buck, a hearty amount and 

The pork belly dish felt a bit lacking with only 5 pieces, but what I had was crunchy, and just melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Came here last November. I actually don't remember what I got, but I think it was a breakfast special with a choice between two meats. 

But I remember that it was good."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night because I've been obsessed with Filipino food ever since I tried tinuno and ube ice cream.

My boyfriend and I got the following: eggplant and zuchinni with coconut milk, flat iron steak, and the pork humba (basically ribs). We also got a side of garlic rice.

The items came in the weirdest order and we ended up waiting really long for everything to come. The servers also didn't proactively fill up our waters even though they did it for the table next to us. They were very friendly however, but just weren't super attentive.

The zucchini was REALLY small and it was $12 - not worth it at all. It tasted good though. The pork was amazing but small portion as well. The flat iron steak was alright - the meat was sometimes tough and stringy and the sauce was kinda weird. The highlight of the night was that we got a second garlic rice for free (but both of them felt microwaved warm ish). I was also disappointed that their halo halo wasn't traditional so we didn't get it.

Overall, for the price of the food, probably wouldn't come back. Nice decor though."}
{"text":"A restaurant deserving of my first official Yelp review! 

Came here for brunch with a friend and we ordered:
- French toast turon: I'm mentioning this dish first, because it was just that memorable and AMAZING. Super unique texture from a combination of soft jackfruit and plantain juxtaposing a chewy and crispy French toast
- Bansilog fish cakes: second favourite dish that we ordered. I would say it resembles an eggs benedict on steroids. YUM.
- Krispy pata: definitely not diet friendly but worth the calories. Be prepared to bite into some (delicious) balls of deep fried pork skin and fat
- Stuffed crepe: mehh...unique filling of purple potatoes though
- Halo halo sisig: mehh...kinda like the Fil-Can version of the Korean bibimbap

Note: Portion sizes are normal sized, we just eat a lot for two petite girls. Haha.

The missing star?
- Service was on the slow side, everyone who ordered after us got their food before us. Maybe it was due to the large amount of food we ordered, but would have appreciated a heads-up from the staff. Otherwise, staff was super friendly and informative of menu offerings
- If you order the mango juice, note that it is from Minute Maid. Calamansi juice is from the Gina brand"}
{"text":"One of the best places I've eaten at during my trip to Toronto.  Loved the Lechon Kawaii!  The service was great and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Fantastic gourmet Filipino food in a casual and inviting atmosphere.

Everything about our experiences here is always top notch. Our first time we sat at the bar (*Note: of you're coming on a Saturday make a reservation) and then returned soon afterward to try the Chef's Tasting.

The staff explained the menu, with a wonderful background exposition on Filipino history and cuisine generally. Our hosts clearly enjoyed talking about Filipino cuisine and their restaurant's interpretation of the many varied dishes. As we learned Filipino cuisine is traditionally defined by region,  and being made up of 5,000 inhabited islands there's a great deal of variation. Even individual families' interpretations of the same dishes adds to the delightful variations. Lamesa's goal is to take these traditional meals to a whole new, gourmet level. 

The first time we chose the prix fixe menu (a steal at $40/person) and were completely blown away by the quality and originality of every course. The menu changes so we won't provide details on every dish here; suffice it to say that if the lamb shank or fried chicken are on the menu when you visit, order both with all due haste!

The 11 course tasting menu was a special treat. It requires reservations and at least 24 hours advance notice so they can go to the market and get special ingredients.  One thing we had come to expect after our first meal was entirely new flavour experiences, a rare treat for two people whose travels mean we dine out often; we are always trying to indulge our love of exotic foods.

Google us and you'll find our blog describing the full 11 course tasting in detail."}
{"text":"Located on Queen Street West and surrounded by a plethora of top-notch restaurants, this \"newish\" Filipino eatery is a place that I've been dying to visit since it first opened its doors. What interested me the most was their menu. I recognized their dishes from the many meals that my mother, Titas and Titos used to cook (and still do) for our family and so I thought it would be really neat to see and taste someone else's modern interpretation of it. I'm not really sure how to describe Filipino cuisine except that it is predominantly influenced by Asian and Latin flavors, incorporating indigenous ingredients. Unfortunately I have not tried Lamesa's regular dinner menu so this review is based solely on my Sunday brunch experience.

Lamesa occasionally opens its doors for a Sunday brunch buffet event called \"Silog Sunday\" and I was excited that I was able to partake in such a delicious function. The restaurant is small in size but that is standard for a Queen Street location. It has a very clean, modern, and rustic look with a few unique light fixtures hanging from the ceiling and placed along the walls. Complete with nostalgia inducing 90's r&b music playing in the background, its relaxed and casual atmosphere makes it easy for people to enjoy their food on a romantic date or an evening out with friends.  When we walked in we were greeted immediately by a smiling waitress who was more than eager to explain the menu to us and who also took the time to elaborate on how the brunch buffet worked. The food was placed in chafing dishes along the bar and the layout was neat and organized, allowing people to move around easily without inconveniencing anyone at their tables. The chef was also at the bar cooking eggs on the spot, just the way you like it.

Filipino's love their meat, so do not be intimated by the abundance of meat served for breakfast on a Sunday morning. From the buffet I had pork longanisa, garlic fried rice, pork torcino, and beef tapa (there was more food available but I only chose these items for my meal). The food was delicious. I especially loved the pork longanisa. Traditionally served \"sausage\" style, Lamesa's version of it is in the form of a \"slider\" which I thought was pretty creative and cool. The taste of the longanisa is more sweet than salty and it goes well with their garlic fried rice. The pork torcino was also very tasty. The meat is thick and soft and tastes like sweet ham. The beef tapa is tougher and consists of dried beef cured with salt and spices, much saltier than the pork but a good combination together. You get a great balance in flavors if you eat the meat with something neutral in flavor such as rice and egg.

Overall, at $20 per seat, this unlimited buffet is definitely worth your money.
I love this place and I love this event in particular. It reminded me of numerous family gatherings where we would eat a copious amount of Filipino dishes for breakfast. The food is delicious but don't expect mom's traditional Filipino meals here...instead expect your cooler older cousins interpretation of it. If you are interested in Silog Sunday I recommend that you make reservations as the seats fill up rather quickly. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Lamesa tries to separate itself from the standard Filipino fare in the GTA and it succeeds, but not by leaps and bounds.

I tried the crispy pata and I highly recommend it-- the portion size is good for 2-3 people and the quality of the preparation is superb (not too fatty, crispy on the right places). 

The sisig is a good effort, but the taste falls a bit on the wayside for my taste. Perhaps the odd mix of chicken, pork, and beef (with some egg) deviates from the traditional Filipino approach too much.

And the big disappointment in my books is the halo-halo dessert. I'm not exaggerating in saying that I've tasted better halo-halo prepared in my own home. Their ingredients is not inspiring and folks would be better skipping it.

One final note: I find it curious that the dinner menu doesn't offer too many choices. 

As someone who grew up in the Philippines, I think Lamesa puts some interesting touches on the Greatest Hits of Filipino cuisine, and this would be a good choice for people not wanting to go out of the 416 area."}
{"text":"Lamesa is not quite there yet. I am not a Filipino but have some exposure to Filipino food and like it. Did not order the sissig as it was not made with pigs ears. The waitress did not inform me that fried pata was good for sharing with 3-4 people. Consequently,  I had to have it packed and also asked for the spicy sauce that came with it. I was surprised to find at home about 5 ml of the sauce!! I have never seen cheap behavior like this in Filipino restaurants before. The Jackfruit creme brulee was very interesting, but the serving could have escaped from a tasting menu. They obiously need more staff. One waitress and a bartender can't possibly keep up. Would I go again? Probably not, unless these issues are addressed. Is anyone listening?"}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant in Toronto.

I opted for the 5 course tasting menu. Everything was incredibly thought out and a delight. The beef tataki appetizer with onion jam and fried shallots was an incredible burst of flavor and texture. The quail was tender and in a savory broth. The dessert was by far the best cheesecake I've ever had. It was served deconstructed and is probably one of the few times I would actually want to ask the chef in a restaurant for a lesson on how to make it ... or at least a copy of the recipe!"}
{"text":"I know Filipino food. It ain't the prettiest thing to look at all the time, so Lamesa does a good job with making the food look really appetizing. We came here with a group for the Kamayan dinner on their Sunday night menu. For $40/person it's a good deal considering all the food you get, and none of us really finished the meal entirely. It was a lot of food! There's something for everyone, but the true standouts were the milk fish, pork rib, and garlic rice. The fried chicken adobo doesn't really taste adobo-y enough, so we all kinda wished they didn't fry it but rather served it the way adobo is supposed to be served. The pork belly lettuce wrap was also just okay...the garlic aioli and pickled carrot slaw thing were a bit much for a meat that really doesn't need much dressing to begin with. The service was great, albeit a little Filipino in their timing, but that won't stop me from coming back and trying their regular menu!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for dinner, it was our first time at a filipino restaurant and trying filipino food. The greatest thing about this place is the customer service- one of the best I've received in a while! The servers were extremely friendly, helpful and attentive (which enhanced our dining experience so much!). The food was pretty good, I've never tried other filipino food so I dont really have another point of reference. If you read their website it says that its not full on filipino food, rather it's western food inspired by filipino cooking style. Overall, no complaints at all. Great job Lamesa!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite brunch spot on Queenie street. The food is amazing. It never disappoints. Great service and vibe in the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"I've been here before for dinner and while I personally thought it was expensive, it was only because it tastes exactly like the food my mom makes but was stylishly presented and proportioned for fine dining's sake. So that can be taken as a compliment because A) it tastes like my mom's cooking so you know it's authentic Filipino food, and B) their presentation is on point. 

I came back more recently to try their brunch menu. Prices seemed to be like any downtown Toronto brunch joint (you're paying for style, any cheaper you should probably just go to an Eggsmart). I thought it was really cool to see traditional brunch items such as eggs Benedict and French toast with a Filipino twist! Everything on the menu seemed delicious. Since eggs Benny is my brunch go-to I decided to order that while my friend got the Silog Breakfast with pork longanisa (you could choose between susag and tocino for your meat). 

I wish I had ordered the Silog Breakfast. The pork longanisa was generously served and had a delicious smoky, charred taste to it from the grill. The garlic fried rice hit the spot and really sealed the Filipino breakfast deal. Unfortunately, my Salmon Benny wasn't as meaty as I was feeling for my first meal of the day and the hollandaise sauce, described as being made with suka (vinegar), ended up having too much suka for my taste. It completely drowned out the salmon and the emsaymada bread it all sat upon."}
{"text":"Lamesa was my first foray into Filipino cuisine. I wasn't what what to expect but came out with a mostly positive experience; familiar flavors to chinese food, just a tad more roasty, garlicky, sour, and soy based. It's was lot more powerful than I expected and I could tell just how refined Lamesa was, I'm just not sure I could fully appreciate it. 

First off I'd really recommend to reserve in advance. Lamesa is a small and quaint restaurant with a warm and cozy atmosphere. We ended up waiting nearly a hour at peak evening time on a Friday evening. 

We started with the lechon which was great It was extra crisp all around, almost to the point that it's mind boggling just how crispy that skin was. The pickled papaya and sawsawan sauce provided a nice sweetness and  tart flavor which complimented the roast pork well. 

The talong was a grilled eggplant and was very tasty. The black bean glaze was sweet and was a bit mild in bitterness. It was very similar to the type of eggplant you would find in dim sum, except theres no stuffing and there's a nice creamy aioli. The garlic fried rice was excellent! A must order to enjoy all these dishes with. The rice was really fragrant and tasty.

For the entree we ordered chicken adobo which we had mixed feelings on. The chicken was wonderfully seared, its just the sauces that I couldn't appreciate. They were simply too sour, garlicky, and soy based for me to enjoy. Combined with the garlic fried rice, the flavors were a tad overwhelming."}
{"text":"Had a lovely time here celebrating my birthday with my mom, step-dad, and fiance.

All of us had never had Filipino food before, so this was a new experience for everyone.

We ended up trying 11 of their dishes on the menu and were delighted with the tastes, textures and flavours. Everything was beautifully presented and plated. Their cocktails were also very well made

My personal favourite items were the tuna kinilaw (incredible ceviche), lumpia sarwia (tender crepe like pasty filled with various mushrooms), ginataan (sweet potato bread on a home made ranch sauce), and sea breem fish (cooked perfectly and a nice balance of sweet/savoury). 

Service was super friendly and attentive, they really made me feel special on my birthday. They even brought out their ube flan with a little candle in it. Thank you!!

Want to come back to try their Kamayan \"hand-to-mouth\" service experience!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner and was able to get a seat with no wait at around 8.30-9pm. It wasn't very busy about 3 other tables in the space dining area. The temperature inside was a bit cold as well. 

We got the sisig, which was ok I have had better sisig, their version is less crispy and greasy but more meaty, I found it a bit on the watery side for my personal liking. The garlic fried rice was good though even though its just the usual. The star is definitely the crispy pata! A large (very large!) chunk of deep fried pork with crispy cripsy skin and it came with 2 sauces. Wash it all down with a San Miguel beer. We ended with 2 little turon pockets, it was banana wrapped in crispy fried pastry with sugary syrup. 

In the end, the place isnt bad but not amazing either. It is a trendy and more modern take on Filipino food and its the only one in the area"}
{"text":"Went here last night because the menu for the week looks delicious (they change the menu every week). The place is easy to find, a few steps from Queen and Bathurst. Place is adequate. Not too small and not too big. We are greeted by our waitress and was very attentive, explaining each dish as it arrived. We ordered the chef's tasting menu, a 5 course meal + unlimited rice.

Chef's Amuse
Talong Quiche. Talong = eggplant. It was nice. It was pretty small, but a good way to get started.

Pulutan/Appetizer
Mango and Daikon Salad with Bagoong Caramel. Mango and bagoong (shrimp paste) is a match made in heaven. Brings back memories of the Philippines where we ate it as a snack. The presentation is top notch.

Halo-halo Sisig - shredded pork, beef and chicken served in a hot plate topped with shredded tomatoes and egg. This is perfect with beer and I hope it would be a little spicier or at least have some chilis on the side. I also like the egg on top of it to be a little runny so that I can mix it up with the sisig as it will cook eventually on the hot plate. Nevertheless, it was still good.

Ulam/Main
Steak Kaldereta - Not your traditional kaldereta. The beef is very flavorful. Presentation is again not traditional but very pretty. The beef complements the potatoes and the carrot pineapple puree just like the traditional kaldereta. Super love this dish.

Crispy Pork Belly Adobo - Again, not the traditional adobo. This one is deconstructed, the pork belly on one side drizzled with the black garlic puree, the garlic and more of the garlic puree in the middle and the soy vinegar sauce in a small cup. Once I combined all of them then it became the adobo we love. Genius! The pork belly's fat melts in your mouth, the meat cooked perfectly and the skin very crunchy. Reminds me of a more flavorful bagnet. The mains are the best among the 5 courses.

Pre-dessert
Taho with Tapioca - silken tofu puree with a lone sago (tapioca). Great palate cleanser although the tapioca is hard.

Dessert
Maple Leche Flan - Velvety and delicious. Melted in my mouth. Perfectly made Pinoy dessert with a Canadian twist. Yummy! Can't get my mind off of it.

Turon Empanada - I expected it to be better than the leche flan but it was not. It was dry and I can hardly taste the plantain. More plantain + more anglaise please! 

Filipino food is known for being homey and traditional and I'm worried that making it too modern will take away the experience. But these folks in Lamesa knew how to balance those and made me fall in love with my country's cuisine more. 35CAD might look expensive for some but for me it is worth it. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try Filipino food. Longganisa is to die for! 
My friend took me here, and I gotta say this place is really good. From the location, ambience, friendly service, and of course great tasting food! 

Since this was my first Filipino food experience I ordered the Chicken Adobo. It's their national dish apparently. The chicken was really savoury sweet and salty (not too salty). The chicken seems grilled or rotisserie. It came with a poached egg with went well with the flavorful rice that came with the whole dish.

Then we ordered the Ensaymada French Toast. I think this is the best french toast I have EVER HAD! I told the server how much I enjoyed the french toast, and he said \"thanks I'll let the chef Daniel know you are enjoying it\" and I went \"DAMN DANIEL!!\"
I know I'm embarrassing sometimes LOL -_-' 
No but seriously please do not go here for brunch and not order the french toast. You will regret it.

I am going back here and bring people with me to try their amazing food!"}
{"text":"This was our second time at Kamayan night at La Mesa, I think the first time was better to be honest. The main meal was great but the first time was really amazing. The dessert this time really fell short. The halo halo was nothing like halo halo at other places we have tried and it was served in a plastic cup. There was what seemed to be old strawberries and bruised/overripe banana in the bottom of the plastic cup but no beans/corn or the red/green jellies which other places have in their halo halo. it was disappointing. I am not sure I would go back after that experience. We also were not checked on that often throughout the meal."}
{"text":"We got here for the special Christmas menu, so it wasn't their regular selection.
Even so - every dish we got was amazing, the service was caring and they made sure we understood what is everything...

and my gosh... that crispy pork... wow.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"You make your way down Bathurst on a cold, blustery evening... happily! Subzero temperatures be damned because you've a Winterlicious booked - at Lamesa, no less. 

AMBIANCE: Upon entrance, you're greeted by a cosy, dimly lit interior with rustic decor. You make a mental note that this would be a lovely venue for a girl's night out / date night. 

SERVICE: You inquire about adobo chicken (it is a cultural experience after all, isn't it?!) and your server graciously explains. Lamesa's servers are knowledgeable, attentively courteous and all smiles. You'll never have to worry about getting your water refilled. 

FOOD: Ube. Leche. Flan. Please. The most outstanding item on the menu?! Take it from someone who indulged in all the sweet options available at this lovely resto!

Lamesa, you'll have me back soon :)

{"text":"Location: Tucked right on the edge of Queen/Bathurst, the restaurant carries a modern decor that unfortunately did not reflect much of the Filipino \"soul\" that I was hoping to see and expected out of a place that's labelled itself as a Filipino kitchen. Because of it's obscure and dim signage, I almost walked past the establishment.

A party of two, we proceeded to order San Miguel beers (not that we had a variety of drink options). With the entrees priced between $20-$27, it was a no-brainer to pick the $35 tasting menu.

For our Pulutan (appy), had the Mushroom Pancit Canton and Halo Halo Sisig. The Canton/Bihon (bean thread vermicelli) noodles were delicate and tasty and was a perfect start to a promising meal ahead. A disappointment to me however, was the Sisig. This is my all-time fave Filipino dish that I have to have whenever I venture out to the Philippines - so I'm a tougher critic on this one. Lamesa's version was disappointingly lack-luster as it under-delivered in all the key elements of what a Sisig should be: (1) meat - \"safe\" ingredients (as opposed to the adventurous pig ears, pork face and liver); (2) presentation/serving suggestion - it came warm (as opposed to sizzling given that it came in a mini cast iron skillet); (3) texture - the meat was just soft (it should be cooked crispy-soft); (4) spices - under-spiced (no chopped chillies, no onions, and just missing a flavor kick). Improvements to any of these elements will definitely be steps closer to getting this one right.

For our Ulam (entree), we had the Short Rib Nilaga and Pork Belly Adobo. While the two dishes were so good and tasty on its own, I was confused on why the dishes were named as such. While I did not expect a full-on Nilaga or Adobo dish, I was expecting a somewhat modern take to the two classic dishes; hints on the classic and not an entire reinvention/bastardization of the classic dishes.
Nilaga is to be cooked in a clear ginger beef broth with traditional vegetables such as cabbage, carrots, and potatoes - sort of like the Canadian-classic, corned beef hash). Instead, Lamesa's version reminded me more of a soy sauce braised beef dish that you can get at any other restaurant, like Lee's (but Lee's is still tastier!). The bone marrow blended in the mashed potato was barely noticeable. 
The Adobo was pretty good (although a little on the salty side) because it was crunchy, crumbly, and melted in your mouth - all thanks to the flash-fried technique used. This dish should have been more aptly called Lechon Kawali. Add a little more tartness to the \"gastrique\" and they would have nailed this more as this other Filipino dish than as an Adobo dish.

Finally, for desserts we had the Maple Leche Flan and Saging Cheesecake. Both desserts were pretty good and were quite filling. While my friend preferred the Leche Flan, I took a liking to the Saging Cheesecake. I thought the use of Polvoron (a traditional Filipino sweet made of toasted flour, milk, sugar, and butter) instead of graham crumbs was ingenious! The cheesecake mixture was delicious and creamy and I definitely recommend this dessert!

PS. The tasting menu also came with 2 amuse bouche / palate cleansers but I didn't care much for them. They came in Chinese spoons so it wasn't really much & undistinctly Filipino-influenced to be even mentioned in here.

Overall, this is a great and promising attempt to what I hope will be a start to the restaurant's evolution over time. The price range is quite steep for the area/neighborhood and there are still lots of room for improvement. I hope they'd inject some Filipino \"soul\" in their decor, put more adventurous dishes on the menu, implement a more reasonable price range (i.e. under $20 entrees, $30 tasting menu), and increase their drink selection (wine and beer) and they'd be sure to increase their intake on business! 

At this current rate I can say I've tried the place, however I wouldn't be back any time soon because of it's steep price. I love to eat out and will pay the price (as all downtown-dwellers do) but unfortunately this place has not (yet) quite made my regular \"go-to\" spots in the city."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner
Specialty: Modern Filipino Cuisine
Menu items: Halo Halo Sisig, Seafood Siningang & Leche Flan

\"La Mesa\" means table, in Filipino. It also has the same meaning in Spanish. And just as multicultural as its name, is the food you find at the new Queen and Bathurst spot offering a modern take on Filipino cuisine.

Lamesa's prix-fixe 5 course Chef's tasting menu for $35.00, is a representation of the aromas, texture and taste of traditional Filipino ingredients fused with international flavours. Owner Less Sabilano and Chef Boquilla are embracing this concept by serving crowd favourites while exploring with world cuisine with new daily menu items.

The fixed menu experience starts with an amuse-bouche consisting of a chilled soup made with roasted corn, coconut milk and smoked bacon that was beautifully placed on a porcelain spoon. The flavour derived from the roasting of the corn adds a nutty note to the soup which is balanced by the creaminess of the coconut milk and is then brought back to basics with the crunchy texture and saltiness of the bacon. A fantastic appetite opener.

Following this, is the appetizer version of the traditional Halo Halo Sisig. The term 'sisig' refers to the spicy and fatty - but oh-so popular - meat dish all over the Philippines. At Lamesa, the basis of the dish is a combination of pork, chicken and beef that has been seasoned and cooked with aromatic spices, white onions, celery, red bell peppers, garlic and soy sauce, to name a few ingredients. It comes accompanied with a Filipino style Pico de Gallo, a lemon wedge and topped with a fried egg. To eat this dish, as instructed by fellow Filipino friends I was dining with, one must first mix together all ingredients on the bowl, grab a spoon of the unlimited white rice served with the dish, add it to it, and then squeeze the juice from the lemon on top, which will add some well deserved acidity to the otherwise fatty feel of the dish. What brought me to understand how much of a staple this dish is in the Philippines, was the reaction from my friends when saying it reminded them of home-cooked aromas with a fresh twist, probably from the infusion of Pico de Gallo and lack of traditional use of offal meat.

With a near full appetite, I am presented with my main, the Seafood Sinigang.
Sinigang is a soup or stew traditionally made with tamarind, daikon, tomatoes and onions. The aroma of the dish brought me to an unknown place. I could not relate it to any stew I've had before. It had a specific smell that resembled notes of tea leafs and mild flavours and then hit you hard with the slight fish smell from the seafood. It wasn't bad, it was just unknown to my kind.
The seafood in the stew was grilled medium-rare and bathed with the accompanying green beans. I was not necessarily a fan of the daikon puree, but then again my nose was also just getting used to the new flavours.

Now on to my favourite part of the meal, a dual dessert experience! Starting a parade of sweet concoctions, Lamesa kicks-off this course with the Chef's pre-dessert - Chocolate Mousse.
The mousse was sweet and had a less dense texture that regular mousse. This is probably from the fact that the Chef confessed to mixing instant chocolate with tea leafs (not sure which kind). The twist to the pre-dessert, was the addition of a topping called Pinipig, which is basically an immature glutinous rice that has been dried out and puffed up. In some cultures, this rice is considered the quintessential rice.

The meal closer, the Maple Leche Flan, was the most versatile and internationally infused dish of the entire menu. The notion of Canadian Maple syrup on a traditional Spanish born dessert like Flan, that was adapted for the Filipino culture during the conquest, opened up the possibilities on what can be done with a rather simple dessert. The texture of flan has to be silky-smooth, so that one's palate is not overwhelmed by the sweetness of the condensed milk and sugar. Kudos to Lamesa for capturing the essence of this dessert.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana"}
{"text":"Heard great reviews so was a little disappointed. The food was pretty good but small portions and pretty pricey.    If they offered more food or was less expensive I'd probably review this place higher."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the Chef Tasting Menu. It is $80 per person for 11 courses.  It's the best way to try everything that is on the menu. 
Service was great as always. Looking forward to trying the \"Kamayan\" hand to mouth experience next time!"}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday, and on Sundays they only serve Kamayan, which is a fixed course tasting menu. The presentation is pretty impressive. It's live-plated at table-side on banana leaves. There were 4 kinds of house-made sauces, salad, grilled corn, garlic fried rice, fried milkfish, coconut milk stewed mussels, ribs, chicken adobo, devilled egg, and sweet potato cornbread. While everything was pretty good, nothing stood out, and some of the protein tasted too salty. Was a bit disappointed in the flavour profiles, to be honest. Still a solid meal, but definitely won't be doing this tasting menu again."}
{"text":"Wow, such a fantastic restaurant!  I've been to a few of the newer \"modern\" Filipino restaurants in the US and this is just as great - Philippine cuisine with a modern or unique twist.  The Roasted Chicken Sinigang was fantastic as was the Shortrib Kaldereta.  I had Pork Belly Adobo on another visit, which was also amazing...a perfectly cooked dish.  For dessert, the Carnation Crème Brulee was outstanding - such a clever twist on a traditional dessert.

I really enjoyed this spot and can't wait to go back.  They change the menu items from time to time so it's nice to try the different creations."}
{"text":"One of my new favourites for brunch. I come here often on weekends around noon and the place isn't too busy - I've always been able to either eat at the bar or table with 1-2 friends. Everything on the brunch menu is amazing, but I always opt for the pork belly sisig. For about $12, it comes with rice, salad and some unique home fries. Also, they've got a banana ketchup that they make in-houes! Would definitely recommend Lamesa for brunch."}
{"text":"The food in this place is really, really good. I would give it 5 stars if it hadn't been for the service. Don't get me wrong, everyone from the staff was extremely nice and helpful, the host especially was super awesome and attentive, the problem is, they need more staff. We had to wait a long time just to get water served, and a long time for our food. The food was great (had the summerlicious menu, with the flan and chicken shining as the biggest stars) and everyone in the staff was working super hard, but there were just too many customers for the number of staff. Maybe we just went during the wrong day or something. The decor is gorgeous, and we loved the ambiance in general. Hope to come back and taste their regular fare too!"}
{"text":"Long overdue review.. I'm definitely coming back here.. Just a quick advice.. This place changes menu, we were looking at the menu on yelp but when we get there it was different. But that's fine, they served us the best tasting fusion food ever! Service was great! Place is small so make reservations! This place is not just for Filipino.. Americans will enjoy the food as well"}
{"text":"Amazing as usual! We loved every second of it. Great staff, our server was awesome.  The eggplant and tofu dish was unreal. The pork belly appetizer was cooked to perfection-skin was crispy, but not tough, and the meat just melted in your mouth. The branzino was spectacular, especially with the garlic rice. A unique combination of flavour profiles that isn't comparable to anything I've tasted. And of course, my favourite, the Ube leche flan was the best finish to our meal. The texture was perfect. It wasn't too sweet and the crispy, puffed wild rice on top was a very nice touch. We love, love, LOVED IT!! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to get my Filo fix when I was in Toronto but this didn't hit the spot. My boyfriend never tried Filo food and after reading good reviews here on Yelp, we decided to give it a go. The food was ok, nothing special. The drinks were good. We had the Filipino Shandy and Classic Caesar. The restaurant was cute, small and clean. Loved the decor!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about Lamesa?!? Everytime I come and bring new guests with me, they're always blown away by the flavour and of course, the garlic rice. On the weekend, it's exactly the type of brunch I'm looking for - something uber savoury and casual. I'd highly recommend both the steak & eggs or the langonisa."}
{"text":"First time at Lamesa for my mom's birthday & father's day. Went for brunch & got the salmon benny as recommended by my sister. I thought it was okay, nothing too special in my opinion but it's my sister's fav brunch meal (she's had it about 5 times). My parents got the silog breakfast, which they said was good. I also got their Filipino shandy which is beer & calamansi juice and I really liked that. Service was pretty fast, prices are fair & staff are very friendly. Oh and they play the best r&b/throwbacks. Would definitely want to go back to try their kamayan dinner though!"}
{"text":"Went there with friends for a brunch on Sunday.
First, you can book online (even for brunches), which is a huge plus!
I find the brunch menu rather small, but it had two veggie options, which is still cool.
Went for the grilled eggplant dish and it was delicious! The garlic rice was amazing and I wish the size was a little big bigger.
My friend had a fish dish (don't remember which one!), and I believe it was a bit more massive and she said it was really good, too.
There was only one dessert available for the brunch, which we ended up not taking.
I think they should expand their brunch and dessert menu."}
{"text":"the sisig was not what i was expeecting...for a delicious pork sisig i suggest Casa Manila.

The portions were small. We had the special \"filipino poutine\" with coconut milk which was a little too sweet for my taste buds.

we were there on wednesday for Half Price Patas which was large enough to feed 3 people. it was ok, but a little too much fat for me.

The ice cream  Sundae was the best part of the whole meal and highly recommend! So many different flavours and textures...just need it to be large enough to share!"}
{"text":"We all thought we were going to eat with our hands for this GNO dinner haha.. Turns out they only have the \"eat with your hands\" / \"artsy dinner\" on Sundays. TECHNICALLY we can always eat with our hands but nah - utensils it is loll
Service was excellent - there was only one waiter for the night but he was quick on his feet. 3 stars for the food and +1 star for the service.

DRINKS:
LOLO COOL J
(Tropical pineapple, bourbon and ginger cocktail)
A fruity cocktail with a light alcohol taste to it. Very delicious (which is why the alchy might catch up to you!)

MERIENDA:
TOASTED SIOPAO
(7up glazed pork, lettuce, aioli, milk bun)
7-up glazed pork sounded so different that we really wanted to try it out! Very yummy - but portion sizes were very small.

WATERMELON SALAD
(Jicama, basil, maalat, chili, citrus, pinipig)
We didn't really like this dish. The sauce was a bit off with the watermelon pairing.

GULAY:
ENSALADANG TALONG 
(Charred eggplant, adobong caponata, maalat, creme fraiche)

GINATAAN KOLIPLOR
(Fried, grilled, puree, pickled, and raw cauliflower, coconut)

Both of the \"GULAY\" dishes lean towards a sour-y taste and it's not my preference for veggie dishes.

ULAM:
SALMON ESCABECHE
(Seared salmon filet, carrot, plantain, sorrel and ginger glaze)
This one was seared soo well! The salmon was so smooth.

LECHON KAWALI
(Pork belly, atchara, Mang Tomas, sawsawan)
So much fatty goodness with this one - tasted lovely with the pairing sauces on the side.

 ADOBONG MANOK
(Seared chicken thigh, soy vinegar jus, black garlic)
Tasted like jerk chicken haha - pretty yummy.

CALDERETA
(Beef shortrib, potato, heirloom carrot, red wine and tomato jus)
The beef shortrib was very tender - I liked this dish. Maybe I got lucky with a good piece of meat because the other girls said theirs was too dry."}
{"text":"I went to Lamesa with a group on Sunday night for the Kamayan experience. We were all very excited and intrigued to try this, as it was a first time for all of us. We all chatted about what it would be like, wondering how we'd manage to eat (the rice, especially) without utensils. It was much easier than I thought, as the rice is slightly sticky, so you could just use your fingertips to press it together into kind of a ball and eat it that way. 

The servers start by \"building\" your meal on the table, but it's not really communal as I originally thought. You basically get your own portion presented in front of you, so fortunately, nobody else's fingers will be touching your food (I was a bit worried about that part). They explained what each part of the meal was, including all the different sauces. Each item sounded better than the next. 

There wasn't a single item in the meal that I didn't love. The Adobo chicken wing was fantastic, as was the milk fish. Delicious garlic rice, as well. I ate every bite - should've taken a photo of my super clean section of leaf afterwards!! I would definitely return for this meal in the future."}
{"text":"I went with a filipino buddy and he said lamesa wasn't truly authentic but honestly it's modernized and the spirit is still there. It was my first experience with filipino food and everything was good from the adobo to the filipino spring rolls, but honestly I would skip the halo halo, I don't think it's that great here. Kanto had a much better halo halo. Excellent service as well. Lamesa is worth a try."}
{"text":"My guy took me here for my birthday. Picked me up from work and took me straight there to have dinner in my scrubs after a 12h shift - exactly how I like it. I wanted to try this place for a while because I love filipino food. I work with a lot of nurses from the Philippines that bring food to share all the time and it's always pretty amazing so I wanted to see how it was done in a restaurant.

The place itself is a standard issue Queen-and-Bathurst joint. Kind of sub-trendy but with good music and a chill vibe, and except for the lights being a bit too bright, it was pretty comfortable. Started with a drink special - a gin/calamansi juice cocktail which, while being reasonably refreshing, wasn't much of a cocktail. I like to be able to taste the alcohol in my drinks (to help with the pace, obvi) but there was none of that here. For $5 though, who cares. My second drink was unfortunately unforgivable, and I committed the cardinal sin of sending it back (something I rarely do because I know how much it sucks). It was something called \"Manila Heat\" which I see now is no longer on the menu - tequila, ginger syrup, and calamansi, were among the ingredients though I can't remember what else exactly. Anyway, long story short, if any of you reading this are in cocktail development or bartending, NEVER garnish a drink with a slit Thai chile pepper - it will render it undrinkable. Though maybe it was a testament to how hot Manila is in the summer - but for now I'll keep my $15.

As far as food goes, it was pretty good with some things better than others: we had the lechon kawali (crispy pork belly) and duck lumpia (duck spring rolls with banana ketchup) to start, and the pork inasal (grilled pork shoulder) and salmon laing for mains. Talong salad (charred eggplant) as a side. Standout was the salmon - probably THE nicest plated dish I've had in a while. It just looked so good on the plate with all the colours and vegetables  and gels on their vintage dinnerware. The cook on the salmon was bang on, and the coconut polenta was a bright, comforting complement and tasted great - exactly what I was in the mood for after work. The pork belly though was a huge letdown - pork belly by definition should be melty, crispy, tender, and unctuous all at the same time, and this was anything but. It was just dry and kinda sad, even with the papaya salad and gels. The rest of the plates were just fine, with honourable mention going to the banana ketchup that came with the duck lumpia because that ish was delicious.

Service - also fine. It was a Tuesday night around 8:30, relatively busy, and only one (very lovely and professional) guy was hosting, serving, bussing, and (as it happens) bartending the entire restaurant. Later on in the evening, some of the back-of-house staff stepped out to the front to help him which I thought was gracious, but having been in his position I felt bad for the guy because it's really hard to get things right when its like that. And in the end it's the customer that pays.

Overall it was a great experience - you can tell they're serious about their food and bringing some of their classic filipino eats to Toronto (at least the ones we're ready for) and I can certainly appreciate that. I bet they do a solid brunch."}
{"text":"Top notch restaurant. The ambiance is very inviting and chill. It can get busy so reservations are recommended.  

This is Filipino food re-envisioned. This is not street corner food. The menu is innovative and well thought deserving of its downtown location. This is where you go for special weekend dinners or dates not routine meals.

I highly recommend this place and I will keep coming back. Hope to see fellow yelpers there!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a modern take on traditional Filipino food, this is the place to be. Everything we had from our cocktails to the appetizer to our individual entrees (which were shareable), to the dessert, was just an amazing flavor experience. Highly recommend!!! Shout out to the waitress who was knowledgeable, friendly, and cool who happened to be the only server AND bartender and tended to us in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Small pretty crowded place. Good food with very affordable price.. Too bad they ran out of San Miguel beer! (Which is the sole reason for visiting the restaurant). It is somewhat a filipino restaurant with a Canadian twist! 
We had a Shared plates: Halo-halo sisig, mango salad, deep fried chicken skin & pork spring rolls paired with the awesome montreal's Blanche de chambly.. Delish!"}
{"text":"This was excellent.   The service was outstanding. First time here. First time eating Filipino.  The Lechon was super delicious. The chicken yummy. We were 3 and shared plates which was an excellent way to try many menu items. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ok, let me preface this review by saying that I had huge expectations from Lamesa, after all the hype I heard.  No such luck when I tried it. 

To start things off look at that Stiegl Radler on my picture.  That will cost you $11.  No matter it's $2.65 at the LCBO.  Yes, I get it, mark-up, rent, mortgage - but 450%? 

For appetizer I had the LECHON KAWALI - pork belly.  It would have actually been good if the pork was sliced thinner.  However, the slices were very thick, so the crispiness on the outside did no carry to the inside, which was lukewarm and very, very fatty - the kind of uncooked fat that chokes you.

Still, the Lechon Kawali was the better dish.  The Chicken Adobo was barely edible.  First and foremost the SKIN on the chicken was so thick and fatty - it drowned out any other flavour (see pictures).  It was not spicy at all, and the sauce that it came with (it doesn't come with either rice or vegetables) - was bland and tasteless. 

The service was not bad, but I had a discussion with the owner/bartender and the server when I got in to get the table next to the window - they told me it was reserved at 7pm.  It was 6pm.  I told them I will be done in an hour - they told me the food takes a long time to come out, so I stopped arguing and got another table.  The food came out at 6:20pm, and I was done and paid my bill (and left tip! which I probably shouldn't have) - at 6:40pm.  Yeah, I know. 

Overall verdict: skip - not worth the money.  Plus I had stomach upset when I got home later that evening - probably from the extraordinary amount of fat on the chicken and pork."}
{"text":"Really unique food and a great ambiance made this an excellent spot for a quiet dinner. The butternut squash congee was amazing."}
{"text":"Lamesa was one of those wonderful unexpected experiences you don't get from a restaurant on these days. We happened to walk in randomly on a Sunday and experienced their Kamayan 'Hand-ti-Mouth' Sunday dinner. It's $40 per guest, but the attention, effort, quality and pure deliciousness level made it absolutely worth it. Everything is served on a layer of banana leaves and the two chefs plate the many components before your very eyes, leaving you with an artistically plated feast before you to devour. Take a moment to appreciate all the colors and textures, and get ready to eat! 

They start with four sauces, each packed with different but well balanced flavor. For example, their mango hot sauce doesn't just bring spice but also sweetness. You spend the meal pairing each bite of food with the four sauces to obtain the maximum tastebud adventure. The food itself is purposefully varied in both texture and taste. I can't tell you which bite was my favorite. Maybe the tender mussels cooked in coconut sauce, the crunch of the fried chicken adobo dipped in the mango hot sauce, the lettuce wrap with lechon and slaw as a fresh palate cleanser, the sweet char of the brocollini, the fall off the bone pork rib in a sweet sticky sauce, that creamy center of the devilled egg, the subtle sweetness of the cornbread.... you get the idea.

Also, did I mention you eat all of that with your hands?  Get in there and have some delicious fun!"}
{"text":"Born and raised in the Philippines to a mom who pretty much knows how to cook anything, I have standards for good Filipino cuisine. With all the glorious reviews I have decided to try this place. We ordered the kaldereta, sisig and lechon kawali. Kaldereta is a tomato based beef stew with carrots potatoes. This dish was good, but was a very small serving. It had 2 small pieces of beef much like an appetizer than a main dish. Sisig is crispy pork cheeks with onions and egg usually served in a sizzling plate. Their version is just okay, nothing ti write home about. Last was the lechon kawali, crispy pork belly paired with a liver sauce. It was good, but again not worth the price for the serving size. Overall, food is ok, this place wouldn't be my first choice if I am craving for a Filipino dish. The ambiance is nice though, its a hip place to go to bring a non Pinoy friend and get a taste of the food. I would bring fellow Filipinos elsewhere though if I don't want to disappoint."}
{"text":"First summerlicious my gf and I visited was at La Mesa. The restaurant was known Filipino food fused with western flavours. As a filipino, I have always thought our food is greasy and rich. Visiting to La Mesa this was my expectation. I was glad to be delightfully surprised. Had the sisig rice for the app. Sisig was served with a fried egg and an aioli sauce on top. It was nice and crispy with the aioli balancing the fatty taste of the pig's head and gizzard. Had the milk fish for the main. Milk fish can be quite dry. This was quite moist and had the vinegary taste. Definitely took me back to my childhood as we used to eat this as breakfast food. Finished it off with ube flan topped with tapioca and rice crispies. That was a great dessert. Smooth, velvety, creamy with an amazing purple yam flavor. This was definitely one of the best desserts i've had. Summerlicious is meant for us to taste different restaurants to entice people in coming back. La Mesa definitely succeeded in doing this. Can't wait to go back for another meal."}
{"text":"Is it upscale Filipino food or re-interpreted Filipino classics? Kinda sorta both. The inside is nicely done in white w/ repro tin ceilings and ceiling fans. I wouldn't say there's a central design theme as much as a mish mash of nice fixtures, but if you don't care about all that design stuff, the important thing to take away is that it's a nice, comfortable space. But how's the food?

Per our waitress, the menu changes daily, although the 5 course tasting menu includes an amuse bouche, appetizer, mid-meal course, entree and dessert. You can also order a la carte.

Today, our amuse was arroz caldo served on Chinese soup spoons and topped w/ a sprig of green onion. The arroz caldo was creamy with good chicken and ginger flavor.

Our appetizers were talong quiche and lamb kare kare pot pie. The eggplant quiche was tasty and well executed, but it won't satisfy your craving for char grilled eggplant dipped in vinegar & garlic, nor should it. It's a dish that can stand on its own.

The lamb kare kare pot pie smelled and tasted of tender lamb seasoned with fish paste. This isn't a gamey lamb, but kare kare is normally beef bits cooked in a peanut sauce. This version lacked the smooth peanut sauce which would've been a good counterpoint to the fish paste and provided the sauce usually associated with pot pies. The crust itself wasn't flaky and tender, but it wasn't terrible either. I liked the dish, but I wouldn't call it kare kare.

The mid-meal course was fried lumpia w/ garlic vinegar. It was a crunchy, veggie filled bite that wiped the palate for:

Pork longanisa on garlic fried rice and fried eggs, and beef tapa on garlic fried rice and eggs (longsilog and tapsilog).

Lately, Filipino longanisa just seems sugary sweet. Lamesa's version wasn't sugary sweet which was good. It had good pork flavor, just a little sweet and still savory. But don't worry, you'll still have longanisa burps later. The beef tapa was tender and cooked medium. WHAT?!? Beef tapa is usually drier and chewier. This was the exact opposite. It was tender and juicy while tasting just like beef tapa with a nice char grilled flavor to it.

For dessert, we had pandesal bread pudding and taho. The bread pudding was dressed w/ Carnation creme anglaise and dulce de leche. This was a very good, sweet way to end the meal. The taho was dense and creamy and served in a pool of caramel syrup and topped w/ tapioca pearls. I mistook it for flan at first and after tasting it, it reminded me of flan. It really is sweet and creamy goodness."}
{"text":"Had dinner here recently and it was a good experience overall.It was on a week night so it was pretty quiet in the restaurant which was great. We had:

Cocktail: Mary Rose

Dinner:
Roasted Broccoli 
Chicken Adobo
Beef Bulalo
Garlic Rice

The drinks are great here. The Mary Rose is light and fruity and I really enjoyed it.

Our favorite part of the meal was the Roasted Broccoli, which sounds weird because it's just broccoli...but it really is delicious. It was seasoned with garlic and peanut sauce and a few other things that made it really unique.

The Chicken Adobo was tasty, but we had expected it to have a bit more to it 

The service was good, our waiter was very nice and relaxed. We had no complaints here. 

Overall I liked Lamesa, and it is a great place to try something new since they create a modern twist on Filipino dishes."}
{"text":"3.5/5

I haven't been to a Filipino restaurant in Canada to eat a full meal before - after all, I can do that easily at my own house. But I figured, if I had to do it, I might as well go to a place where they've modernized traditional dishes a bit and added that North American flair (for the novelty). Lamesa did a pretty good job, I think.

We came on a Sunday morning, just before noon, and were seated fairly quickly. They weren't busy yet, but I could see that three big tables had already been reserved. My partner was a little disappointed that they only had the weekend brunch menu (he really wanted roast pork), but I think it worked out well. We were pretty hungry and I don't think we would have been satisfied with a sharing menu.

My partner ordered the pork belly tocino with cassava hash and eggs while I had the bifstek with eggs. When the food arrived at our table, they came with greens and garlic rice. Filipino dishes are very protein-rich and carb-heavy so I appreciate the addition of vegetables even as I pondered at how weird it seemed with the rest of the food. 

The garlic rice was perfect. The steak and the pork belly tocino were OK - although I had been expecting the steak to look and taste like actual Filipino bifstek (it didn't). It was on the medium-rare side, and our server (who I think is also the owner) never asked how we wanted our eggs or steak done. A minor oversight, but maybe we should have known better. I did like the gravy and the cassava(?) sauce that the steak was on.

Overall, a very filling meal, as Filipino meals are (and should be). I found the portions just enough - and although I really wanted some ube leche flan to top it off, regrettably I had no room.  

The whole bill came to less than 40 after beverages, tax and tip, so quite reasonable, really. I rounded my rating up to a 4 because good gourmet Filipino restaurants are far and few in between - if not completely unheard of - so it's nice to know they exist and that there's a market for it. I would not hesitate coming back and trying other dishes - if that counts for anything!"}
{"text":"We tried this place on a whim...walking down Queen Street to see what we're in the mood for is our new way of picking restaurants, apparently. We walked into an empty restaurant at about 9:45...the place closes at 10. But the staff (owners? managers?) were happy to accodmodate us and told us we had 10 minutes before the kitchen closed. So we gave it a shot. The atmosphere was really cool. I loved the vintage style of the place with the addition of a few plants to add a tropical vibe. The resto was empty due to the late hour, but I bet this would be a really cool place when closer to capacity.

Our server was a very friendly woman who informed us that there were some house specialities that were not on the menu, and on offer for $5 (so reasonable!). So we opted for beef skewers that were marinated in Sprite and soy sauce. They were delicious and cooked perfectly.

It was a quiet night for us, so we skipped a cocktail and went for juice instead. They had a number of tropical fruit juices available. I picked Guava and the hubs picked mango. Both were tasty, but I was disappointed to see them both come from a can when she was pouring (I love love love fresh juices!).

We both ordered the Chicken Adobo. Neither of us are very familiar with Filipino cooking, but I wasn't expecitng the dish we received. Our dishes arrived with three pieces of (very crispy) fried chicken, with some garlic purree and a small piece of grilled corn. And that was it. Thankfully, we'd ordered a side of rice, but this ended up being a small bowl of bland, sticky rice that seems like it had been sitting around for a while (quite dry). The chicken was good, but the puree wasn't enough to cover the dryness and blandness. I'm a fan of dishes with sauces and heat, and this one had neither, so I struggled a bit (although again, first time with any kind of Filipino dish, so not sure if this is the norm). 

I might give this place another shot and try another dish. But wasn't completely impressed by the first impression."}
{"text":"Delicious Filipino food with a modern touch. Very creative and beautiful. Loved how the food was passionately describe to us as it reach our table. We had their tasting menu, a little on the expensive side, but well worth it in flavour, quality and execution. Service could have been a tad faster, but we were in no rush and really enjoyed our experience. Nice ambiance, and I love how all the tables in the restaurant were from the same tree. Lamesa means \"table\" and that detail surely add a very meaningful touch to the restaurant. Great job, will come back and recommend!"}
{"text":"- Service was good
- We ordered:
 + Tuna Kinilaw which was tuna sashimi with some kind of sour sauce and shrimp chips, it tastes ok to me but my bf thought it was good 
 + Chicken Adobo is basically bake chicken with soy sauce that I usually cook at home, nothing special. Definitely not woth $20 
  + Ginataan is deep-fried cauliflower with little cuts of coconut, it was good
  + Garlic rice to eat with the meat, went pretty well
  + Flan cake (i don't remember the entire name) it's like a purple ube pudding on top and cheese in the bottom, decorated with couple drops of lemon juice and tiny pieces of grapes. This cake was a signature of our night, I thought the flavour blended super well together and totally different from the flans that I usually have.
- Price varied from $10-20 per dish
- Will not come back again because the food is like typical asian/chinese food that I can make it at home."}
{"text":"Are you tired of waiting in line for brunch downtown? Look no more! We love coming to this place because we usually can grab a spot without waiting forever in line. That and it's solid brunch fare (consistent quality, decent price, and great service). We have usually recommended to friends getting the silog breakfast with tocino and/or bangus (milkfish), adobo chicken, bistek and eggs. So good! And dat cassava hash!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Lamesa forever! I was really surprised by the unexpectedly hip/trendy atmosphere and the tiny space. Service is friendly and prompt. This was my first foray into Filipino fare, and it did not disappoint!

Food is served family-style, so my friend and I ordered a few plates to share. Our Crispy Pork Belly was quite, well, crispy, and delicious, although the slaw that accompanied it was a tad too tart. The Chicken Adobo is a must-order: tender chicken that melds perfectly with the rich sauces on the plate; and the Garlic Fried Rice is a perfect accompaniment. Last, but certainly not least, we NEED to talk about the Broccolini. Normally, vegetable sides are not much to write home about. HOWEVER. That Broccolini is SO GOOD. The nutty sauce that dresses the perfectly cooked greens is just such a winner.

Overall, a fantastic meal. Looking forward to trying some of their other mealtime offerings!"}
{"text":"The Filipino cuisine was a first time for me. And it was great. We had the pork octopus dish and the beef main course dish with garlic rice. Portions were small for the price. Ambience was good. Great for a date."}
{"text":"*2.5 stars* Extra 0.5 star for the tasting menu- great deal, I must say.

My dinner date and I came here on a Saturday night after hearing and reading all the buzz online and seeing all the pictures.  We made reservations for about 8:30, and was empty except for a rather large party in the back (which actually knows the staff, I think).  Definitely not what you expect on a weekend night at a new and  supposedly trendy place. 

My date is Filipino himself and knows all the traditional flavours, and I have been out to some more traditional Filipino restaurants around the city.  So we're both quite familiar with the cuisine, but the dishes here are served with a modern twist, and we were excited! The menu is nice and concise consisting of a snacks/apps section, an entrée section, and desserts.  There is also a tasting menu of $40 per person which includes an appetizer, an entrée, a dessert, as well as an amuse-bouche and a pre-dessert from the chef.  There is also a chef's tasting menu of $80, but reservation in advance is required. 

Merienda Platter: $10-12?? (4/5 stars)
We couldn't decide which app to get, so we got the platter.  Great portion for the price.  It includes several pieces of chicarron (deep fried chicken skin), one slider burger, one lumpia, and an empanada.  All was quite good.  Great start to a meal!

If you know me (or at are familiar with my reviews), you'd know I definitely went for the tasting menu as well... both of us.  Only way to go:

Amuse-Bouche: Complimentary
Small portion of Filipino congee served in a little jar.  It was cute and quite good.  But it was congee... I'm Chinese, so I'm allowed to be picky.

APPS-

Halo-Halo Sisig and Rice: (3.5/5 stars)
I'm going to admit, if it's one cuisine I don't really love, it's Filipino cuisine.  However, I LOVE sisig! I also know the BEST place in Toronto to get it!  The sisig is here very hearty and non-traditional.  It taste was good but I would have loved if they used traditional pork rinds, all crisped up! 

Seafood Paella: (2.5/stars)
I would have given this a 3/5 IF this was in fact paella.  It was much more of a risotto with the type of rice that was used and the consistency.  So basically, imagine a risotto-like dish with seafood.

MAINS-

Crispy Pork Belly Adobo: (1.5/5 stars)
They claim it's pork belly, which quite possibly could be. But, what a waste! The fatty bacon goodness is not there!  Instead, expect a few small slices of dried (though tender) flavourless pork with an overly sour gastrique.

Carre-Carre Briased Short Rib: (3/5 stars)
This was okay.  A generous portion of beef rib, braised and topped with a peanut butter sauce.  Not bad, but have had better.

Admittedly, I can't quite remember what I had for dessert...
Overall, I was disappointed, but good pricing for everything if you were to try it for the first time.  I definitely recommend getting the prix-fixe like I did!  I have to admit that their website looks amazing right now and the food looks great!  Too bad an appealing website does not KEEP customers.  Maybe, i'll give them another try sometime... not in a rush."}
{"text":"Ordered their lunch/merienda menu for the day:  adobo buns with salsa on the side ($12).

Very small space/seating, hence, the line-up...bordering on hype.

It is Filipino-fusion.  Expensive, of course, the rent on Queen St W is expensive too.  Taste-wise, not mémorable, yet authentic.

All presententation/drama....but no substance."}
{"text":"After waiting months to finally try this restaurant, my boyfriend named reservations for the first day of Summerlicious. It was definitely worth it. 

For drinks, I ordered the Filipino Sandy which was calamansi and Mill Street organic combined. My boyfriend had the Lolo Cool J which was their version of a whisky sour and he loved it. The added touch of ginger and pineapple really made it good. 

For food, We ordered the sisig, fried chicken adobo, sarsi ribs for dessert, the Ovaltine cheesecake and ginataan sundae. 

The sisig was good, especially with the calamansi. The fried chicken adobo came with 3 pieces and the breading was thick and crispy, covering the juicy marinated chicken. The sarsi ribs were sweet and sticky, and basically fell right off the bone and melted in your mouth. Delicious! 

I wasn't a fan of the Ovaltine cheesecake, it was more of a mousse and it tasted salty but I'm not sure if it was just me or the amount of butter from the polvaron crust? Hmm?

I like it here. Only gave 4 stars because they charge $3 for garlic rice. And the desserts could be improved just a bit."}
{"text":"I knew I would like eating with my hands off of banana leaves. That's why we came for the Kamayan offering on Sunday evening.

First of all, once you are seated, the service is surprisingly quick. They explain everything they lay out in front of you and you are left to ooh and aah (or ask questions). Then you can dig in. The food itself is tasty and if I could use one word to describe it, it would be \"garlic\" and if I could use another, it would be \"fishy\". But not too fishy. They do have a vegetarian option.

But let's get to the star of the meal, the Ube Leche Flan (purple yam custard with calamansi gel). SO delicious. SO beautiful (it's purple). SO just yum. Maybe I need to eat more flans and less straight up chocolate from now on.

Oh yeah, and the restaurant itself is very cute and cozy feeling. Lots of chatter noise but not so noisy that you can't talk to whomever you are with."}
{"text":"Came here on New Years Eve which may explain why it was not an enjoyable experience as it was very busy and the restaurant was very understaffed. 

Ordered from the prix fixe menu. Had pancit for an appetizer which was good. Chicken adobo for entree was not great. It was difficult to eat also as it was served on a wooden cutting board. Our server said she would bring rice for our table to eat with the chicken but no one ever came back and or even near our table. My partner's meal ended up getting cold before anyone ever came by. We had ordered another appetizer but it came after our entree because they forgot about it and we also received the wrong entree before ours came out. 

I really wanted to like this place, but it was just not great."}
{"text":"There is absolutely nothing wrong with the menu, nor the locale.

Situated right on the busiest stretch of Queen West, the unassuming restaurant serves up some of the best South East Asian food in the city. 

With an extremely young chef who appears eager to churn out interesting iterations of Philippine flavours, every dish is created with a unique flair.

Take the fried Milkfish. I can understand if the average North American cannot stomach the idea of eating a fish with it's head attached, but one would be sadly amiss to turn away this perfectly prepared entree, with it's perfect balance of crisp and tender.

Sizzling Sisig melts in your mouth like so much rich goodness, which guaranteed, will tempt anyone into ordering another skillet.

And frankly, at the prices they set, there's just no reason not to eat at Lamesa, one of the best kept secrets on Queen West."}
{"text":"I've been to a surprisingly small number of Filipino restaurants ever. So when I saw a place in Toronto near by that had good reviews, I was pretty excited to try it. 

I met up with a friend here at 6PM. We were the only two in the restaurant for a while, so we were able to order and get our food pretty quickly. While we were there, the tables all got filled up, so making a reservation might be a good idea (unless you wanted to chance it).

The staff recommended that for two, it would be good to get 3 things (an entree, 1 or 2 starters, or 1 or 2 salad/side) + rice. My friend doesn't like veggies, so we ended up sharing two starters (lechon kawali--or crispy pork belly and dip; and the corned beef lumpia), an entree (chicken adobo), and a bowl of garlic rice. For us, it ended up being exactly the right amount of food for two. Enough so that we were able to also get a chocolate pandan cake for dessert, but probably not much more.

I thought the food was very good. Flavour wise, I thought everything tasted pretty good. I wish the pork belly wasn't as crispy as it was (if that makes any sense), but I thought it still tasted good. I also thought the dessert was going to be half pandan, half chocolate, but it ended up being chocolate, with a hint of pandan flavour infused in there. It was a good chocolate cake--just different from what I thought it was going to be.

Service wise: I thought it was very good. 
Ambience/noise level wise: it was great for conversation.
Price wise: I think some of the other reviewers thought it could have been cheaper...obviously, I would never complain if it was cheaper. But I thought it was reasonable.

One final note: my friend had been here before and told me that the menu changes. I'd come back here to try other dishes, for sure."}
{"text":"We had the Tuna Kinilaw, Pork Inasal, Adobong and Langka cake.

Lamesa is an intimate place, ideal for a catch-up with friends and lengthy discussions. We were promptly seated and given glasses of water shortly after arriving. Meals are meant to be shared, so pick a few things and enjoy!

The tuna Kinilaw is a Filipino ceviche, that reflects the island's Spanish influence. It's light, and delicious. 

The pork was tender and juicy, and our favourite overall. 

The chicken was crispy on the outside and very flavourful. 

The cake was a bit dense but I liked the balance of flavours. The rhubarb complimented the cake very nicely."}
{"text":"Uber delicious food + awesome staffs. Definitely recommend it. It's become one of my favourite spot now."}
{"text":"Food wus amazing!. The drinks were soo good  but what made this place 5 stars for me wus the staff I will defanatly be back"}
{"text":"What a surprise! I had no idea what to expect but knew I was in for something special the second I walked in. The place has a cozy home-like feeling while still being obviously a delicious and successful restaurant. The food was excellent (got the salmon ceviche dish, the crispy pork belly, and the night's special, a seafood chowder for two). It was all outstandingly delicious. The daiquiri was very well made, and San Miguel beers carried me through the rest of the meal. Good thing I wasn't interested in wine, though, as the options looked pretty terrible. Strange. 

I can't wait to go back and try other offerings."}
{"text":"I give the service 4.5 stars and the food 3.

The service was excellent. They were attentive and very knowledgeable about what was being served. Considering I came with a party of 30 people, the service was amazing. Unfortunately, I found that the service was slightly slow, but again, it's probably because they were trying to serve 30 of us approximately at the same time.

My first impression when I first walked into this narrow Queen West \"gourmet Filipino\" restaurant, was that it was a very sociable and lively environment. However, there was very little Filipino cultural aspect to the restaurant.

Anyhow, on to the food...

Because the seating was so limited, my partner and I (and several other couples) were seated away from the rest of the group, but we were fine with that. We ordered the $30 prix fixe menu. I chose the Halo Halo Sisiq & Rice as an appetizer, pork chop, and the coconut cheesecake. We also got an amuse (butternut squash soup) and a pre-dessert (mango and melon puree). I found that the food was a tad on the salty side, particularly the pork chop. The cheesecake was too sweet for my liking, and I usually like sweet desserts. 

The presentation of the food was great and I liked that the waiter explained what was in every dish. I found it very interesting that the cheesecake was deconstructed with the crumbs beside the cream cheese part. I love the chef's creativity at this restaurant and it appears that the menu changes every so often as well. 

I haven't had very much Filipino food in the past, so I don't have too much to compare with. However, I found that this experience felt more \"gourmet\" than it was Filipino. I'm not so sure I got a good understanding of what Filipino food was all about at this restaurant.  It was good, but it was not great. I also don't think that it was worth the amount paid. 

On the other hand, this place might be good as a tapas restaurant. I didn't get to try the dishes, but they sound and look great on the menu."}
{"text":"When I go to Lamesa, I discover new flavors and flavor pairing I never even knew existed. Everything on the menu is amazing. The service is always superb. The decor (even the bathrooms) is very neat."}
{"text":"I can't say I go out for Filipino food very often. So if you're like me and haven't had much exposure to this delicacy, this is your best bet to get your feet wet... :)

Here is what we had to order (2 ppl):

TUNA KINILAW 
- albacore tuna, coconut, avocado, calamansi, chili, shrimp chip

This app was amazing, I would highly recommend it.. A great way to start your meal.

CHICKEN ADOBO 
- seared chicken thigh, soy vinegar jus, confit garlic, chimichurri

The Chicken was prepared well and was quite tasty - it could have a bit more to the portion for that price point.

BROCCOLINI 
- bagoong, raisin, garlic, peanut, chili

This was a huge hit and definitely a dark horse. I like broccolini on a good day but not a must at most meals. The server told us this was her fav veggie dish... Otherwise I would not have ordered it. Once I had tried it, I can see why it was so popular...

CORNED BEEF LUMPIA 
- house corned brisket, swiss cheese, cabbage, mustard, banana ketchup

I would say this was my least favourite of the lot... It wasn't bad, just not outstanding. 

In conclusion; it's worth a visit to this place, I'm pretty sure I'll be back to sample the other items Lamesa has to offer..."}
{"text":"Lamesa was my first Filipino food experience, although I hear from my Filipino friends that it is more of a fusion restaurant.  The place was quite hipster, so fusion made sense.  While waiting for my party, I ordered the \"Lalita?\" drink.  I'm not sure if I'm getting the name right, but it was a mix of mango juice, Malibu and Baileys - oh boy was it ever delicious.  I went with a group of 8 people and so we were able to try a little bit of everything on the menu.

Seems to me that Filipino food has a lot of egg in it.  Starting with the deviled eggs, and then moving onto other entrees with egg in it.  That's probably the first thing I noticed.  There were forks so we used utensils.  I was excited about eating with my hands... but I conformed since that's what everyone else in the restaurant seemed to be doing.  The crispy pork was probably the highlight of the entrees.

Moving onto dessert, they had this dessert with purple things on the top and it was probably the best thing I tasted all night.  Yum!  I don't even have much of a sweet tooth, but I loved this dessert.

I think that overall it was a good experience to try out a new type of cuisine.  Would I come back?  No, not for the same menu because now I've tried everything and I'd have to say that nothing warrants the trip back, however if they do change up their menu then I would consider it."}
{"text":"I have limited experience with Filipino restaurants - I've only been to Bistro Manila and Jesse Jr. Based on these two restaurants, I basically summed up Filipino cuisine as the saltier and greasier version of Chinese food :P I wanted to try a more refine version of Filipino cuisine and decided to give this restaurant a shot.

The first dish I tried was halo halo sisig with garlic rice. I forgot what the protein of the dish was but it was very flavourful and not too salty! It was a great start to the meal.

For the mains, I got the kare kare and my friend got chicken adobo. My friend thought that the adobo was very sour and I had to agree. The kare kare was very tender and I enjoyed the pieces of fried fat. However, if I was to come back to this restaurant, it wouldn't be for the mains but for the halo halo sisig.

We ended the meal with ube leche flan and it was DELICIOUS. It wasn't overly sweet and the ube flavour really came through. I would highly recommend getting this dessert."}
{"text":"The service is excellent and the chicken adobo is great but the portions are very small and over priced as is the wine list. They are using the gouging Spanish tapas method of pricing.
Good experience once but would not return."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend on a Tuesday evening - we didn't have a reservation but it wasn't busy, so we got a table right away (managed to snatch a window seat :). I've never really had Filipino food and have been wanting to try it for a while, so was excited for this meal.

The waiter introduced the tapas style menu and seemed pretty knowledgeable. We decided to not order any mains, but a bunch of starters instead as a few of them caught our eyes. We shared a salad of tomato, salted egg and anchovies (tomatoes were quite tasty but the rest a bit too salty), 2 bistek siopaos (we both liked red meat so enjoyed the patty, and the milk bun was interesting), and tuna ceviche guac with shrimp chips (the guac was probably my favourite dish).

We also ordered a side \"vegetable\" (vegetable pancit - which was mainly glass mung bean noodles topped with some peas and red chili peppers). I thought this tasted fine, but not really note-worthy. My friend said I had to try the garlic rice, so we got an order of this too. It tasted like the Asian fried rice I have at home - good but again nothing special.

Finally, we shared half a bottle of pinot grigio (there's always a time for red wine) and were pleasantly surprised. The table beside us had some really cute looking cocktails which I'd like to try if I go back.

We probably ordered too much for 2 people (had to leave a lot of the noodles and rice) - but I think the portion sizes would have been just right if we ordered the right amount of dishes for 2.

I later found out this was the favourite downtown Filipino restaurant of one of my Filipino friends. Overall I had a good experience here, and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in trying out a new type of cuisine."}
{"text":"The best Filipino restaurant in this city.  We came here for Summerlicious and it reminded me of the awesome restaurants in the Philippines and also in Vancouver (Pin Pin anyone?).  It's more Filipino fusion than traditional Filipino food, but they keep enough of the \"Filipino-ness\" in the foods while making it both aesthetically pleasing and delicious.

I ordered the pancit, sarsi ribs and the guinataan sundae.  They were all delicious and I loved that they had calamansi on the side of the dishes - very authentic!

The only thing was that the portions were fairly small but it was enough to keep us full.  Just something to keep in mind if you have been to other Filipino places.

Ambiance and service was great.  It was a fairly tight space but it worked well."}
{"text":"I went a couple of times and usually got sisig with egg and rice. I've had the arroz Caldo and it was decent. But The whole menu is overpriced and It's hard to justify paying that much for their plates when you look at the portions and quality. The quality is okay. I find Filipino cuisine has too much pork but Lamesa tries to introduce different dishes to Canadians and makes them easier to try. The portions however are laughable. They had calamari for 5 dollars and the bowl was so small when it arrived on our table that I thought it was garnish. They used shrimp instead of squid because they ran out. Overall I wouldn't recommend this place for a regular spot but it's ok if u want to try Filipino cuisine once and you're new to it."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious! I love the unique flavors and they take the time to explain the dishes so you can decide what you want. We have been here for both dinner and brunch and loved it for both meals. 
For dinner and brunch they have a chicken adobo dish which is my favorite with the garlic rice. For brunch they also have a delicious French toast. The bread is a brioche, so it's the richest French toast I have ever had, but quite delicious. 
The place is quite narrow so if you have a stroller it would be better to leave it at home. They do have a high chair if you bring a baby. And they were helpful and accommodating."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant last night with a friend - the food was excellent, the service was amazing. It was my first time trying phillipino-style cuisine, and the staff were very helpful - they clearly described everything we were being served. The restaurant has a great atmosphere and it is in a good location! Would be a good place for a date. 

I highly recommend giving this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"I'll keep this review short and sweet. Lamesa is a wonderful restaurant with very friendly knowledgable staff. Food presentation is excellent and the restaurant atmosphere is very chill. The food itself is very tasty and has a lovely home-cooked quality to it. Each dish is cooked to perfection. You'll find it hard to nit-pick about how to improve the flavours. 
I do have one negative for this place.. As I mentioned the food has a lovely home-cooked quality to it yet the portions are on the small side and the price for each dish is on the higher side. Feels a little expensive for that 'home-cooked' feeling. Just my opinion. I do recommend giving this place a shot. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"4.5/5! 
*great service and great food, just like last time. 

-Beef Cheek Sinigang (House corned beef, bean, radish, greens, citrus and tomato broth) - $24: 
Friend ordered the beef cheek sinigang and she said the beef cheek was incredibly tender. I only tried the broth as she was raving about it as well and I have to say, it was the star of the dish! The broth was clear, sour but not in an artificial way and very refreshing with all the slightly-steamed vegetables.

-Lechon Kawali - (Crispy Pork Belly, Picked Papaya, sawsawwan) - $12:
So much fatty goodness with this one. Crispy skin and tender pork belly, need I say more? The acidity from the picked papaya helped to cut down the fattiness of the pork belly... However, that dipping sauce or sawsawan?! I don't know what is it made of but it was slightly sweet for me, and I thought the flavor combinations were pretty interesting (in a good way!).

-Pork Inasal (Grilled Pork Chop, 7-Up glaze, scallion, pearl onion, pineapple) - $22: 
The pork chop was on the verge of being dry, hence the -0.5 point :(. With that said, I found the jus really helped to keep the meat somewhat moist, and don't get me wrong, the pork was seasoned perfectly with a hint of sweetness from the 7-up glaze. The tangy pineapple cut through the heavy pork chop and I didn't care too much for the scallion since I didn't think it was needed

-Halo Halo (Strawberry anglaise, apple tapioca, blackberry gel, ube leche flan, shave ice) - $8
I was quite surprised to see this being served in a take out plastic cup and I was hoping there would be jellies or fruits like the one I see in other restaurants. Nonetheless it was still good and although a tad too sweet, that's expected from the creamy ube (purple yam) flan and ice cream. With every bite you are getting some crunchy texture from the rice krispy topping and apple tapioca, overall a very refreshing and fun dessert!"}
{"text":"I'm happy to see a Filipino restaurant in the Downtown core.  The pricing is in the higher end, conservative portion BUT food is very delicious.  I describe it as Filipino food with a touch of exotic style. 

I like the place, though kinda small but it's nice and cozy.  
And nice touch when the server explains the food."}
{"text":"Jackpot! Lamesa was delicious, friendly, casual, affordable. The menu was simple yet creative, steeped in Filipino tradition all with a Toronto twist.

So thrilled my wife and I stumbled across this place. We were hungry and wandering aimlessly and it stood out as a perfect place to relax yet try some new exciting food.

Despite having no reservation they took us in and made us feel welcome. My knowledge of Filipino cuisine isn't great but I'll try to describe what we had as it was all perfect.

Well I started with a glass of wine. A delicious cab served in a glass. Started with a kind of butternut squash risotto, topped with brussels. Zingy and rich. Had to slow ourselves down. Next was chicken adobo, so so tender and bright. Then, my favorite, roasted broccoli with curry, peanuts, and a shrimp paste. Holy moly. Add a $1 bowl of rice and we were in heaven.

We actually weren't planning on getting dessert, but there was a mix up where our server ended up dropping off the yam flan at our table. We were surprised and definitely naive in our incredulity. We didn't question it, just offering our thanks for this kind gesture. It wasn't communicated that it was an accident until after we finished it. But we definitely should have questioned it. Sorry Lamesa! Anyway, it was one of the best desserts I've ever had and I would get it again in a heartbeat. Purple yam flan, cool, creamy and not too sweet, accompanied by all kinds of colorful sauces and fruity bits bursting with juicy flavor.

Not sure what the dessert cost but everything else came out to $50. Worth double!

It'll be one of those nights/menus that I wish I could relive for sure. Next time!"}
{"text":"Finally, a classy Filipino resto in Toronto. It's about time. Being Filipino myself, I've only seen the cafeteria style Filipino restos. I've eaten at Lamesa a few times already and I've always been impressed as to how they add an artistic touch to the Filipino cuisine. The chefs here truly consider Filipino cuisine as an art form and they do a great job of showing it. But most importantly, the food is amazing. You can't go wrong with the crispy pata (fried pork on a bone) and the 'halo halo sisig' (a jumbled up plate of fried pork, chicken, and beef with garlic, chillies - with a fried egg on top). The ambiance is cozy. The decor includes historical images of Filipino heritage on the walls - but with a modern touch. You will definitely not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I visited as a group of 9 the past Saturday at around 2 pm. The service was great and the staff were very attentive to our needs, for example, making sure our big group was seated comfortably and taking the time to explain the menu to us. 

The chicken adobo ($13) offered a piece of chicken thigh, mixed greens, poached egg and garlic rice. I absolutely loved the sauces on this dish! The rice was good but I wish it was served hotter and more \"fresh\". Portion-wise, the size was perfect for a girl like me! 

My boyfriend ordered the silog breakfast (also $13). This came with cassava hash (a type of root), two fried eggs, mixed green, garlic rice and a choice of boneless milkfish, pork belly or pork sausage. He chose the pork belly and was given 4-5 short, thin slices. Portion-wise, we both agreed that this brunch item wasn't worth its value. 

One of my friends ordered the ensaymada french toast (purple yam toast) and this was very interesting! This toast was drizzled with a sweet syrup and chunks of purple yam custard.

All in all, I'd love to Lamesa again because their food was simply amazing and overall, the restaurant interior and service brought a very warm and homey feeling."}
{"text":"We came in at about 845, and the restaurant was full. We had a reservation but our table wasn't set yet but we didn't have to wait for one as a table had cleared up when we walked in. 

Food: The food here is amazing, it's definitely a more modern take on Filipino food but I definitely see some of the resemblance from the classic dishes. The only thing that was disappointing was that the dishes were extremely small, the prices were a little bit too high for what we were getting, and it being a Filipino restaurant, I was expecting to be a like family style sharing dishes, but this is far from it. I wouldn't recommend to share these dishes. We ordered the broccolini, the pancit, the duck lumpia, the congee appetizers and the octopus entree. We shared these 5 between the 3 of us and we weren't full after, if I ever came back to Toronto, I'd even buy two appetizers for myself and an entree to expect to be full from the meal. I was disappointed in the pancit as they used a round thick udon-like noodle which is nothing like pancit and the sauce just tasted like soy sauce. The broccolini and the lumpia were out of this world though. Really recommend those two! The congee was intresting. The octopus was really good as well, it was cooked perfectly and didn't have that rubbery texture that you usually get with octopus/squid that's grilled.
Atmosphere: The atmosphere here was kind of homey-like but a little too dim for my liking. The table settings were a nice touch though. 
Service: Both our servers never smiled. They seemed uninterested in serving us, or anybody as a matter a fact, but they both knew the menu very well. It was nice that they described the dishes as they came out to us.

Food: 5/5
Atmosphere: 3/5
Service: 3/5"}
{"text":"Our first Summerlicious meal in 2014! I've wanted to try Filipino food for a while and this came at just the right time. This restaurant is a bit smaller but quaint and the nice service with good food added up to a nice night out. 

The decor of the restaurant was nice. Honestly looked like somebody's home but it felt welcoming with the friendly staff.

My fiance and i started off with the Halo Halo Sisig. This was very interesting, because my understanding of Halo Halo was only with the dessert but I learned it just means a mix of things. This came in a mini iron skillet which was a nice touch and allowed for the food to kept warm. I'd compared this meal to the Korean bibimbap (I'm Korean by the way) without the spicy red pepper sauce. MIxed altogether, you have nicely cooked well seasoned pork, chicken and beef with a fried egg, raw tomato and onions and chilies. I didn't feel like this was an appetizer at all because both my fiance and I were a bit full after eating this. A good balance of nicely cooked rice with pork/chicken/beef withe flavours I couldn't place with tomato and onions. Hearty and a well balanced dish. 

Next we ordered the Fried Chicken Adobo and the Sarsi Sticky Ribs. The fried chicken was okay. The outer layer of the fried chicken seemed like double or triple deep fried because it was super crispy (which was nice) but the meat itself was okay. It could've been seasoned more. The larger piece was dry. The sauce it came with however, was delicious! Even the grilled corn with the sauce was delicious! It had some sort of onion with roasted garlic and some sweetness. Addictive sauce. My ribs were just alright as well. I myself don't really like ribs but I wanted to try ribs Filpino style. The ribs were cooked perfectly, but I could tell it was cooked in a pressure cooker, so it was missing that charred grill taste and texture. The ribs, well, just tasted very meaty. Somewhat seasoned and no sauce at all to complement the meatiness of the ribs. I'm sorry to say but this dish reminded me why I don't really like ribs. The coleslaw was okay, more sour than I would've liked. 

For dessert, we ordered the Ginataan Sundae and Ovaltine Chocolate Cheesecake. I would've hoped for a Halo Halo shaven ice dessert (my favourite) but it was an additional $7 and despite my wanting it, it was too much after our dessert course. The Sundae was beautiful. The ice cream was purple (perhaps Taro?), there were green small jellys, caramel popcorn, corn puff cereal, and whipped cream. Just the look of this dish was beautiful and once you dive into it, there are so many different flavours and textures. However, way too sweet. Finally the ovaltine cheesecake....not good. It came in a tiny jar, you know the ones you use for a candle. My fiance told me about ovaltine, I've never had it, but I should've listened. It's some sort of sweet powder, and the malt with cream cheese, egh. Sorry, this was a bit of a disaster. Even me, with a sweet tooth, did not finish this. 

Overall, a nice meal. The waiter and waitress was really nice. The waiter even came and explained the first dish and crouched down to our level to speak to us eye to eye. I thought that was nice. I'd definitely recommend this  restaurant to others. 

A note*: on the Summerlicious menu, this restaurant did initially have Halo Halo dessert on its menu!! http://www.toronto.com/articles/lamesa-filipino-kitchen-summerlicious-menu/ I'm disappointed because this dessert was a big reason why I decided to come here. It is on the menu but an extra $7. The item that replaced the Halo Halo was some sort of creme brulee. Too bad."}
{"text":"Wow. Really enjoyed this place more than I thought I would. They have really great vegetarian options. If you have a a vegetarian in your group I definitely recommend. That being said, this place is on the smaller more intimate side in terms of size so may not be able to accommodate larger groups. 
Lovely vibe, good service and good food."}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky when it comes to Filipino food, as our cuisine is usually almost always at its best when it's home-cooked. It's more soul food that way. When my husband and I came in for brunch I was a little bit surprised when I saw the portion of milkfish on the bangsilog I ordered, as I am used to getting the entire fish lol. BUT it turned out that the portion was just right because we also ordered some sisig ala cart. Next time I'm in Toronto I will check out dinner. Overall though, I commend Lamesa for doing its thing- I feel like it's challenging for Filipino restaurants to be as successful as it seems to be. The vibe was cool, and the people working there were cool."}
{"text":"I expected more from the pork belly having tried the Chinese roast pork but it was still enjoyable.

Clean and efficient"}
{"text":"I was reading great reviews online and thought of trying this place out on our next trip to toronto. Filipino food is not expensive, cooked from the heart like how mom always does it and very tasty. This restaurant did not deliver though :(

It was a tuesday and we had 2 choices - get the tuesday 5 course prefixe for $30 per head or get the tasting menu for $80. It was our first time so we opted to get the prefixe set.

1st course - pandesal with cheese/butter/sugar - good but small portions. was ok..

2nd course - sisig with egg and rice - sisig tasted like canned tuna/chicken chunks with no flavor at all. egg was overcooked, not runny and did not blend with sisig well. rice was in a seperate container - nothing special about it. I was dying to get some knorr or Maggi seasoning but i only got patis from the server. 

2nd course (alt) - pancit - my wife did not get her 2nd course till after 15mins - we were done with our sisig. it was really bland and not good. worst pancit i have tasted - it wont even compare to carinderia pancit. i think lucky me instant pancit canton was better.

3rd course - sarsi pork ribs - small portion and did not really taste the sarsi. so so dish and not worht remembering. grilled liempo marinated with soy sauce is way better and tastier. ribs were served on a wooden chopping board and we had to eat on it - i really hope they wash that board well since wood sips in juices/bacteria that won't be removed by regular cleaning. we all had to eat on it (no plates)

3rd course (alt) - fried chicken adobo - omg this is bad. 3 pcs of chicken and like bonchon style of cooking - it tasted sour and we really did not get the adobod flavor. we were all hungry but couldnt finish this all since it really did not taste well.

3rd course (ala carte) - boneless smoked daing bangus - this was the only meal that i enjoyed but we were all dismayed with the earlier meals already so it did not help much. 2 small daing na bangus for $18.

4th course - watermelon juice and mini sago in a shot glass - takes 3 sips to finish and there was nothing special about it. i have to say it did no even taste refreshing.

5th course - halo halo - all ingredients came from a bottle or ice cream container. no fresh ingredients and no banana/langka! served in a plastic container - i had better halo halo elsewhere - we can make better halo halo at home.

5th course (alt) - ice cream sundae - this was the the best i think from the set - ube ice cream with corn puffs, cream and polvoron. really yummy and delicious.

total bill - $249.

we all left the place scratching our heads on why filipino food did not make us feel at home. only dish worth remembering was the sundae and the rest was probably the worst filipino meal we have ordered outside home.

also, only 2 servers and we did not get our food in time nor did we get sufficient service/attention.

i hope they get better :( i am very dissapointed."}

{"text":"This review is for the Sunday Kamayan feast

The kamayan (hand to mouth) feast is fantastic. It is kind of like a tasting menu that is served all at once, and with art mixed in with a \"live performance plating\".

Rice, meats, and seafood/fish are laid on top of a huge banana leaf right in front of your eyes and decorated with different sauces.You are expected to eat with your hands, so I suggest you start with some mussels and use the shells as a scoop for the rice.

I would caution against coming here overly hungry as the plating is done live for every table, and it can take a while before they get to you. I tend to eat very light at home so I found the sauces (laid on the rice and meats) just a tad too salty for my taste, but it is not a deal-breaker.

I recommend getting the ube leche flan as a dessert - it is amazing!"}
{"text":"I was invited to a kamayan dinner at Lamesa Filipino Kitchen, and having heard great things about Lamesa over the years, I RSVPd as soon as I got the invitation.  I was so eager to finally try the food at Lamesa, that I did not read the WHOLE invitation. In fact, I had no clue what \"kamayan\" even meant! 

Kamayan style: meaning \"with hands,\" from the Filipino \"kamay\" = \"hand\"

In other words, no utensils! Ick! Okaaaayyyyy, let's admit it--not using utensils and eating with our hands is not unusual, we just avoid doing so in public! And well, culturally, being Hispanic, I don't always use utensils when I eat, but I do use tortillas or bread to act as a vessel for the food I am consuming. That said, this dinner experience was going to be an opportunity where eating with your hands was not only going to be acceptable, but also mandatory. 

Set up:
Every table had banana leaves covering it. Imagine a tablecloth made out of banana leaves. 

Sauces:
Bagoong caramel - fermented shrimp paste
Soy garlic puree
Housemade hot sauce - roasted red pepper, chilies, vinegar, sugar
Sawsawan gel - soy, vinegar, garlic

Salad:
Green mango salad - sour mango, heirloom carrots, arugula, radish, sweet mango chutney, garlic corn nuts

Meat & Seafood:
Sisig lettuce cup - chicken, pork, beef with chilli, garlic and onions
Kare Kare oxtail - braised oxtail in a peanut garlic sauce
Smoked boneless bangus - marinated milkfish
Crispy chicken adobo wings - soy and vinegar reduction
Clams and mussels ginataan - coconut milk, ginger and garlic

Sides:
Garlic fried rice with crispy garlic bits
Grilled corn
Grilled baby bok choy
Ube cornbread - sweet purple yam
Chicken tinola broth - chicken, chayote, ginger

Garnishes:
Kale chips
Fresh calamansi
Sweet pea shoots

Experience:
There was an air of excitement when the food was being placed on the table. The staff seemed to have a system to their \"madness.\" You really got the sense that they had practiced this process and there was a reason why each item was placed where and when. It started with the sauces, followed by the construction of the mango salad, then it was proceeded by the rice, meat, fish, vegetables, garnishes and it ended with the most delicious corn bread I have had in a very long time. 

Highlights:

Watching the food be placed throughout the table. It really felt like food was being used as art and the banana leaves was the canvass.

The cornbread made with purple yam was delicious. I told the chef how much I liked it, and minutes later I was handed a small to-go container filled with the corn bread! Made me so happy!

Eating with my hands with a bunch of fellow bloggers trying not to overthink the experience. I did cheat by using the shells of the clams as a utensil. Sue me!

Would I do it again?
Maybe. I loved the whole theatrical aspect of the experience, and several of the dishes were delicious. However, I am a picky eater in that I do not eat onions. Several of the dishes had onions and as a result I was only able to eat some of the food that we were served and was still hungry after I left the restaurant. So much so, that before I even got on the streetcar, I had already inhaled the corn bread I was gifted. 

The staff at Lamesa did say that if you can't eat certain things and/or have an allergy, that you can let them know in advance and they will try to accommodate you. 

The kamayan dinners are available every Sunday from 5 PM and the cost is $40 per person.  Call to make a reservation. I think that with friends and/or family, a kamayan-style dinner would be a fun culinary adventure."}
{"text":"I was certainly not disappointed by Lamesa! Having wanted to try it for some time, I finally made my way there on a Saturday night for dinner with some friends. 

I love the cocktail list, and the entire menu looked so amazing. In fact, we ordered every entree to share (except the mushroom one because gross). All the food was so delicious, it was one of my best dining experiences of recent memory! It's to the point that every time I meet someone now, I suggest it, hoping to get back there! 

I have recommended it a few times to friends as well and they are never disappointed.

The one thing I would say is that this is definitely \"new Filipino\" - I wouldn't call it traditional by any means (though, I don't have much experience with the cuisine!)

Next time you're looking for a delicious albeit not inexpensive meal, look no further!"}
{"text":"We ate at Lamesa on a Sunday evening. They only offered Kamayan which is a preset menu for the cost of $40 and is eaten with no cutlery. The experience and food was unforgettable and delightful. This is a good place to go for date night, friends gatherings and family dinner. My kids thoroughly enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"FOOD: 

PRO: Good presentation of food. Since they have a bar here, you can order the famous San Miguel Beer from Philippines.
CON: Food tastes ordinary. 

PRICE:

CON: It's expensive and you won't get the value from what you paid for.

AMBIANCE:

PRO: They have a bar and kinda a romantic vibe at night coz you get to have a candlelight dinner.
CON: Small space, too tight. 

SERVICE:
CON: OMG they're by far the slowest! You wait for like 30 to 45 minutes for them to serve your food during peak hours."}
{"text":"I hate writing about a negative experience.  Sometimes experiences just stinks... literally.  Food was pretty good and service was good as well.  What was pretty terrible was the atmosphere.   The smell that rose from the bathrooms and into the dining area was like the sewage system of Queen St deciding sit among the dining tables.  It was pretty awful that we ran as fast as we could after eating super quick.  I don't think we stayed more than 30 minutes here.

This is a pretty small restaurant and we arrived when it first opened for Sunday brunch.  I've read great reviews on how it's the best spot on Queen St W for brunch and I've also been to Lasa and loved it.  Our first experience was opening the doors and stepping into the smell.  It was over powering.  They hadn't open the doors to the outside quite yet so the smell just hanged around like a bad ex (or a terrible metaphor).

Service here was pretty quick and took our order quite quickly (thank god).  We had a french toast, the Ensaladang Talong (grilled eggplant salad), and an OJ.  The bench seats werent too comfortable in the back seating area but I wasn't expecting to lounge here too long.

French Toast - With housemade brioche, this was a super rich and indulgent brunch dish.  The custard went through completely and made it more like a very moist cake.  The butter hits your tongue last as you enjoy the flavours of it.  The calamansi was a nice needed tart citrus that just cut through the richness of the brioche, dulce de leche, and ube flan.  The ube flan was a nice visual contrast as well.  4/5

Ensaladang Talong - Using the Asian skinny eggplants, they grilled them till tender and drizzled a sweetened soy that reminds me of kecap manis.  It was really nice and the small salad added on top was a nice addition but certainly could have been more.  Most of the plate was left empty to accommodate the single poached egg.  The egg was really well done as it nicely oozed the yolk onto the eggplant and coasted the garlic rice that I added to the dish.  Personally, I would have loved more vegetables instead of the huge generous portion of garlic rice.  The rice was tasty but I didnt need the large bowl of it.  3.5/5

Orange Juice - I normally won't rate OJ... especially bottled ones but they were charging $4 for the small glass that was poured straight out of the bottle.  It's a little steep.  We could have bought a 2L tropicana for that. 2/5

Overall, I wish we enjoyed our time here but between the smell and the OJ... it just didnt give us the right vibe to rate it a 4 star and a return visit.  It's unfortunate because I would have loved to try their Sunday Kamayan feast."}
{"text":"We came here due to a recommendation from a friend but ended up very disappointed. The appetizers didn't take very long to serve, but we had to wait over 40 minutes for the first entrees to come. We were getting irritated by the time the first entree came, and just when we thought our wait was over, the 2nd and 3rd entrees took another 25 to 30 minutes to arrive. The quality of the food did not fail to disappoint further.

The servings were puny and did not taste very good. We were advised at the beginning by the server that the entrees were meant to be shared, but they arrived in sizes not nearly enough to satisfy a single person. The food tasted bland and every dish had tons of cilantro for some reason.

The restaurant was also not well maintained and the washroom was dirty and smelled very bad. There was a pungent stink of urine as I went down the stairs towards their bathroom.

For a party of 3, we ordered 4 appetizers, 3 mains, and 3 sides of rice. We ended up paying a whopping $50 each person. I've been to much better restaurants and only paid half this price."}
{"text":"Wow a third update and it's not so I can complain? This review is for Lamesa's new brunch menu.

I am so very glad Lamesa decided to do brunch. The man and I love brunch (see: wedding menu). We had a server we hadn't seen before, a lovely lady that stuck true to the service offered at Lamesa; hint: very good. She was pretty proud of the Yoda-themed boardwalk sign she had done up. To her credit it was really funny.

The brunch, like the rest of the menu, is a refreshing twist of Filipino and Canadian cuisine. I had the Pork & Pancakes. Mm, whipped coconut cream + a sweet and salty pulled pork atop light fluffy pancakes. Just a warning the portion size is small but the price reflects it, so nobody is getting \"cheated'. The man had the Halo Halo Sisig with Garlic Fried Rice because \"it's not breakfast without rice\". A true Filipino statement! Lamesa even has rice sides for brunch. We've had the Halo Halo Sisig before and it was as delicious as previous visits. 

For dessert we had a cool twist - Halo Halo stuffed into a crepe. The dish was delicious and aesthetically pleasing. The Mango Mimosas rounded out our brunch, whatever champagne they use was delicious and almost yeast (in a good way).

Can't wait to come back, as usual."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.

Decided to try this restaurant for lunch on the weekend, turns out they had a brunch menu.

Chicken Adobo ($13) 
Comes with garlic rice. The chicken adobo apparently is a Filipino classic dish. The grilled chicken thigh was good, was really flavourful but the portion is kinda small if you ask me. Poached egg was absolutely perfect, and no where near being overcooked. Mixed in nicely with the chimichurri and confit garlic sauce.

Silog Breakfast with Pork belly ($13)
For the silog breakfast there are 3 options of protein to choose from. We went with the pork belly. Nicely cooked but lacked a bit of flavour. The fat was completely stuck to the meat of the pork belly. Comes with 2 fried eggs and cassava hash. The hash was good, really crispy. The texture was like potatoes but had a separate distinct taste. We saved the fried eggs to mix in with the garlic rice. The garlic rice was good, reminded me of the rice that comes with Hainanese chicken. 

Food was good, but not too special in taste and portions were slightly small in my opinion. Service was good."}
{"text":"I'm not the most adventurous eater, so this was a big deal that I dined here. I have to say that this was the best meal that I have tried in a long time. The service was superb and the atmosphere was relaxing. Everything I tried was another party for my taste buds. I highly recommend this for even the pickiest eaters."}
{"text":"Went there on Friday night with my friend. Good thing I made reservations hours before going as it was quite full. 
Albacore Tuna: Delicious! 
Pork Shoulder: Delicious! 
Ginataan: Delicious but portion was too small.
Green beans: Nothing special. 
Ube Leche Flan: Yum!"}
{"text":"I went for brunch with some friends who'd been before, and I was really pleased to have tried out the non-traditional brunch. I got the Silog which came with beautifully crisp pork belly and incredibly garlicg rice, and also tried some of my friend's french toast. Both were delicious. I also had a filipino shandy (craft beer and calamansi), which was also great. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a good brunch spot that's a little off the beaten track."}
{"text":"Superb Filipino fusion cuisine that infuses just the right touches of the diverse cultural mix that Toronto has to offer. Great atmosphere, presentation, and service. A nice little surprise in the middle of the West Queen West neighborhood."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I would often visit Lamesa to get their Ube Leche Flan to go. It's one of the best desserts I've ever had. We only recently dined in for our 1 year anniversary dinner. It was a great experience. The servers were attentive, friendly, and very informative. We ordered the pork belly, cauliflower, and chicken. A friend suggested I try the Filipino beer with my meal, and I applaud her for that recommendation. I loved everything about this restaurant. The place is a bit small, but it feels cozy. Next time I'm on the go, I'm going to add their pork belly appetizer with my ube leche flan"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out forever and I finally, finally went for brunch the other day. 

Their brunch menu consists of around 8 items, split between Western-style and traditional Filipino dishes. 

We ordered the chicken adobo (chicken thigh, poached egg, mixed green salad) and silog breakfast (pork belly, cassava hash, fried eggs and mixed green salad). Both came with a bowl of garlic fried rice. My chicken adobo was pretty good and the chicken was especially tender. I can't really speak to the authenticity of the food but I thought everything was pretty solid in terms of flavour. 

Just a note that the restaurant is pretty small and can fit maybe 25 people at most.

They have a special kamayan hand-to-mouth dinner on Sundays and I'm looking forward to trying that."}
{"text":"BF and I were doing a bit of a \"tasting\" night, and the first on the hitlist was Lamesa. 

First, our server explained to us that \"Merienda\" are appetizers, \"Ulam\" are the entrees, and the \"Gulay\" are the sides. This was helpful to get us started, and to gauge the correct amount to order.

Food was amazing, hands down. I ordered the the Lechon Kiwali ($22), which was crispy fried pork belly with pickled veggies and comes with a bowl of rice. This was served beautifully on a wooden cutting board, with 10-12 generously sized pork belly pieces of fatty goodness. If you're thinking about being healthy, this is not the dish for you. But if you're fine with eating Fat with a capital \"F\", this dish was all about the melting fat, perfectly paired with sweet sauce and kicked off with the sour picked veggies. Winner. I'll exercise after!


Also ordered the Sisig ($12), which is chicken gizzards, fried egg, and pig's face. What is pig's face, exactly? Not sure, but whatever it was, it was cooked down to a crispy little dish, and topped with a fried egg. This appetizer was just ok, nothing to scream about. 

Overall, I loved the meal here. The server knew we had somewhere to be in an hour, so he made sure the food was out as soon as possible. And wow, they cook FAST when asked! I appreciated that a lot!"}
{"text":"We came in for a weekday dinner with a small group of friends. Every single plate we had was absolutely outstanding. Seriously, every item was off the charts - service, presentation, and TASTE. This is a must try restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good.. Expensive tapas but some where out of this world. Especially the crispy beef. That was the star of the meal. I'll be back for that delicious crispy beef."}
{"text":"Modern Filipino cuisine is a rarity in Toronto but thanks to Lamesa Filipino Kitchen you can experience the bold flavours in Filipino inspired dishes served up by the new head chef Daniel Cancino. Daniel was born in Hong Kong but raised in the Philippines so he is very familiar with home cooked Filipino food. Daniel began working in the food industry at the age of 15 and after completing the culinary program at George Brown college he worked at many notable restaurants in Toronto such as Hudson Kitchen, Kanto, The Thompson Hotel, and Union.  He is now the head chef at Lamesa where his culinary upbringing and Toronto learned cooking techniques have given him the inspiration to produce a unique spin on classic Filipino dishes.

With the addition of head chef Daniel also comes a brand new fall/winter menu at Lamesa that features visually stunning dishes with sweet and sour flavours.  The menu includes a number of items that I had never tried before so I was extremely excited to preview the menu.

When I arrived at at Lamesa, I automatically felt a very cozy and intimate atmosphere.  The lights were dimmed, the space was long but narrow and some chill hip hop jams were playing. There was also art pieces throughout the restaurant which I later found out were from a number of Filipino artists in the community. After getting seated and being welcomed by the owner and chef Daniel, I was ready to indulge in quite an eclectic menu.

Here's what I tried:

Boracay Breezy Cocktail - dark rum, coconut rum, banana liqueur, house made peach liqueur and macerated strawberry syrup

Tuna Kinilaw - albacore tuna, coconut calamansi vinaigrette, fresh chiles, coconut guacamole, shrimp chips

Beet Maalat Salad - salted egg, white anchovy, beets, Thai basil, watercress, wild rice

Corned Beef Lumpia - House corned brisket, house banana ketchup, house cheese, house kimchi, cabbage mostarda

Ensaladang Talong - roasted eggplant, eggplant caponata, creme fraiche, salted egg, puffed wild rice, sweet soy

Cauliflower Ginataan - Roasted and grilled cauliflower, green cauliflower puree, coconut cauliflower foam

Pork and Octopus Dinuguan - octopus, pork cheek, onion, apple, maple puto, pig blood

Beef Bulalo - beef short rib, bone marrow, cabbage, potato, salsa verde, beef and ginger broth

Ube Leche Flan - spanish style custard made with sweet purple yam, puffed wild rice, apple tapioca

The highlights for me were the Tuna Kinilaw, Corned Beef Lumpia, Beef Bulalo and Ube Leche Flan.  The tuna tasted extremely fresh and paired perfectly with the coconut guac and shrimp chips.  The corned beef lumpia's were like a spring roll on the outside but filled with corned beef goodness inside and served with homemade banana ketchup and kimchi. The bulalo broth was so tasty and aromatic and the beef literally fell right off of the bone. The ube leche flan was unreal and I don't think I have ever tasted something quite like it.  Not only did it look lovely, but it tasted amazing.  Very light with a creamy texture and the perfect amount of sweetness.  Loved the addition of puffed wild rice and apple tapioca which made for all sorts of fun textures in my mouth. 

My least favourite was the Pork Octopus Dinuguan.  This dish was just weird to me.  Octopus paired with pork and pigs blood is just not appetizing and it wasn't visually appealing either.  There was so much strong sour flavour as well, the whole thing unfortunately threw me off.

Overall I really enjoyed my experience at Lamesa and would come back here for drinks and starters.  The main dishes were good, but I really enjoyed the smaller plates.  It's great to have a culinary hub for all things Filipino in Toronto so be sure to check out this spot if you want to experience a modern twist on your favourite Filipino dishes!"}
{"text":"Service - 5 star, inviting, knowledgable, Actually seems to care about your experience.

Food - 5 star, my girl friend and I ordered the chefs choice and it was packed with unique and delicious flavours from the appetizers to the dessert. ( the broccolini and the dumplings were insane).

Ambience - 5 star, perfect for a date night very quaint and the lighting was perfect, also a plus they were not blasting rap (great for the gym or a club not so great for a date). the service also added to the ambience of the place to make it feel very inviting."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Filipino cuisine from a friend I was really intrigued. Then once while hanging out in Toronto I passed Lamesa and took a quick look at their menu. I loved the way they modernized the cuisine and the description of all the food made me determined to try it. 
Its important to note that you definitely should reserve a table, especially for a Sunday dinner when they so the special Kamayan style dinner. 
I went on a Saturday night. Upon entering I was immediately greeted and shown our table.
The menu was short and simple and I already had in mind what I wanted to get (based on my friends recommendation). However, the server suggested that we should order a couple of things and share, since the portion sizes are quite small and also because that is the traditional way of eating. 
The prices were pretty steep for the claimed 'small serving size', but nevertheless, we ended up ordering almost everything on the menu. 
I appreciated that they brought the food in pairs and cleared up immediately once done with a dish, so that the table was never too crowded with plates.
The food was to be eaten with either plain rice or garlic rice. We got both, but only the garlic rice was demolished, since it was so good, even on its own.
Every single dish I had was delicious. What I would recommend from the appetizers would be  the tuna kinilaw, the lechon, talong salad (charred eggplant), pancit canton (egg noodles).
Then from the mains: some steak (don't remember the name), pork humba, and the chicken adobo. 
Finally the dessert we got the Ube leche flan, which was HEAVEN!! we also got the halo halo, which was good but did not shine after eating the ube flan. 
So overall, service was awesome, ambience was awesome, food was exceptional, price was a bit high but worth it."}
{"text":"My experience at Lamesa Filipino Kitchen had changed my conception of Filipino food forever....

I have my share of Filipino food from food court, hot tables and even home cooked meals... but a Chef tasting menu, that really something I want to try!

Mother Day's Brunch at $25 that includes 5 tasting courses or you have a choice to order everything a la carte. With the help of my sweet waitress equipped with an ipad, I decided on the following dishes

First Course - Chef's Amuse
- Congee served in a spoon... with pieces of chicken
- nicely presented, A-OK but not amazing

Second Course - Pulutan
- Green Mango & Daikon Salad with a bagoong caramel
- sweet mango VS bitter Daikon VS salty shrimp paste caramel reduction
- a complex interesting taste

Third Course - Chef's Mid-Course
- Spring roll with a vinegar dip
- fresh and hot... bite size portion
- wish it is a little more

Fourth Course - Ulam
- Pork  Longanisa Silog with 2 Fried eggs over Garlic Fried Rice
- Perfect dish for brunch.. the eggs are fried with a super crispy bottom but the yolk still runny...
- Home made pork patties with vinaigrette dipping grilled to perfection..a little sweetness, a little sourness and a little spiciness.. love the taste of grilling!

Fifth Course - Dessert
- Coffee and Pandesal Bread Pudding
- Served warm with a great dolce de leche sauce

For the sweet that comes with my bill is a Polvoron, a home made milk powder candy!!

The menu is well balanced with Filipino, Spanish and Chinese influence. The deco and the music here also reflect the Spanish influence.

Services here is one of the best I experienced for a long time. 

The menu changes everyday, check their website for updates.. but trust me, there will be something that everyone would enjoy doesn't matter when you dine!

Lamesa's Chef Tasting Menu for dinner is $35... maybe I need to come back for that?!"}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day brunch today and was fully impressed with the experience, as was the rest of the party of five. Perfectly executed, delicious brunch that, like Lamesa's dinner offerings, does a beautiful dance between gourmet and home cooking, exotic and familiar. 

Highlights: 

French toast - this is house made brioche with dulce de leche, calamansi (a citrus fruit), and a flan on top. It came to the table dressed to the nines and was eaten ravenously. 

Egg entrees - whether with juicy + crispy chicken thigh with chimichurri or steak or eggplant, the members of the table who ordered poached egg dishes were served their own bowl of garlic rice (which on its own is amazing) and a nice side of greens with a calamansi dressing that was so good I asked the waiter about it and he brought us a little serving for the rest of the table to try.

Service and ambience are solid. You feel like this is a place where everyone really cares and there's a strong family atmosphere, alongside playful street art inspired walls and a fully stocked bar for the evening. 

Lamesa is still totally the real deal for delectable Filipino food and I want to eat there again, immediately."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The first time was a total accident - a buddy and I went to 416 but the wait was stupid long so we went for a walk and I recognized my flag (I'm half filpino) so we came here.

The kitchen was closed because it was late, but the service was pretty extraordinary. The bartender  managed to get us some appetizers. We had the fries with panco (play on poutine) and crab or fish cakes (it was a while ago so it's hard to remember). The food was interesting and the vibes were good so I vowed to come back for a full meal.

I finally got the chance to eat dinner here. It was good.. Again, service really impressed me-I like how they chef comes out and explains the dish.. The food is definitely not traditional Filipino-the restaurant never claims to be traditional.. We got the Chicken Adobo and Sticky Ribs and Garlic Rice. My girlfriend loved her chicken (accompanied with corn) and my sticky ribs grew on me. At first it wasn't what I was expecting.. to me it tasted more like sausage than ribs, and I was a little confused at how to attack it because I was given a spoon and fork. Most Filipinos are used to a spoon and fork but not me.. Anyway, the confusion went away as I jabbed my fork into the ribs because they were fall of the bone... literally. They ended up being really easy to eat! Garlic rice was a let down.. I don't like my rice hard and sticky. I prefer fluffy. The girlfriend wasn't a fan either.

I was about to rate this a 4, but after really thinking about my experience I can't give it less than a 5. We went on a Friday night. I like their choice of music, but it got a little loud because of all the people. But all in all, good job Lamesa, I'd recommend you to friends and already have."}
{"text":"I went back today and it was a lot better... last time,  no one followed up with us, explained what we were eating, offered us dessert or asked if we wanted our bill... The gentlemen serving us were very attentive and followed up with us without being annoying about it.. we ordered

Asado pork slider - vinegary and delish.. The fresh homemade pandasal was really good.. but hella small for $6.. but it's a hipster place, so what can you expect?

Halo halo sisig - soooo good.. so much better than the last time... A lot more flavor and it seemed like a bigger portion too.. totally worth it with the garlic fried rice

Crispy pata - it's something you can only eat twice a year but jeez...  its beyond amazing.. I don't eat crispy pata nor have I ever liked it. . but this is the only place I'll eat it

Ginitaan sundae - perfect way to end the meal.. I'm not one for desserts or filipino desserts, but the coconut and ube ice cream was amazing.. totally worth it"}
{"text":"When you walk into Lamesa you get overwhelmed with a feeling a nostalgia and family. The only problem is that the food has much to be desired. It's fatty, not great in flavor and overall just not appealing. Breaks my heart to write this review but good a heart doesn't make a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Great location in trendy Queen West. The staff was very friendly and informative of the dishes brought. The food was tasty and well presented. We were rushed out at the end of the meal to make room for another group with a reservation. This is ok, but it would have been nice if we were told before we were seated that we had a time constraint.

Was a bit expensive for the portions (total came to $80 per person with one drink each), but the ambience and tasty food would have me coming back."}
{"text":"I went here on the word of mouth hype this place has generated and it lived up to all of it. I was recommended the Krispy Pata and this amazing dish could not have been prepared any better. I was blown away by the sheer size of this beast platter and it defeated me. You will even just want to come for the classic but modern stylings of the place. I enjoyed the company of the staff who were nothing but welcoming, whole hearted people who strive for excellence and it shows. Lester you got something good going on here. Lamesa just made the top list. Fellow Yelpers, don't miss out; you'll regret it!"}
{"text":"I had been avoiding Winter/Summerlicious for years as I find the restaurant's food and service to be absolutely terrible, and not an accurate reflection of actual capabilities when not operating in overdrive.  That being said, a friend suggested that we go, and I suggested Lamesa as I'd walked past a number of times and was curious to see how the food was!

I will preface this by saying that I'd only ever had Filipino food a handful of times in my life - once it was a hearty stew, another time it was at a terrible restaurant in London, and then - Lamesa.  I have to say, I was really impressed!  The food was beautifully presented, the service was on point, and the food I ordered - the \"fish and chips\", the chicharrons, and the ube dessert, were all super amazing!  I would definitely return not for a Season-licious."}
{"text":"First time trying Filipino cuisine.
I loved it! My experience at Lamesa was amazing.
The staffs was amazingly friendly and the food was delicious.
We went there around 8pm and the ambiance was really nice. Casual and not too loud.

For sure, I will come back if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"This place is  way over rated man. The food  was just ok. You cant expect 4 star rate for this restaurant as in Yelp. Nothing spectacular about the food. We got disappointed. Maybe thats what we get for only $25 summerlicious. The waitress was so super nice though. She gave us an extra jar of cheesecake dessert, maybe because she realized how shocked we were when we looked at that tiny little cup of dessert (as small as a baby's palm).... Haha
Find somewhere else for summerlicious worth your money.  Cheers."}
{"text":"We went to Lamesa for a Saturday brunch. We passed by Lamesa numerous times whenever we were in the area but we never bothered to check it out until that one fine Saturday. The place looks small from the outside but it actually goes pretty deep with 10+ tables for 2. Because it was towards the end of their brunch service, we were able to get the table right by the window. People watching and brunch go well together :) 

Service was quick and attentive. Our server explained the brunch menu (half western inspired and the other half traditional filipino). We went witj the traditional menu, ordered the Bistek & Egg $15 and Silog Pork Belly Breakfast $13. Both came with a bowl of garlic rice, which was deeeelish! Husband's beef steak (bistek) was cooked to a perfect medium rare with brown onion sauce and poached egg that, after he mixed them together, coated the steak with delicious gooey-ness :) My Pork belly looked dry but it actually wasnt dry at all! It's sitting on a bed of hash brown which was nicely seasoned and crispy! The Simple sunny sideup eggs made a perfect match for the grilled pork belly (I dunk the belly in the runny egg yolk, yum!) Both dishes were presented nicely on colorful stoneware plates. They were a feast to our eyes AND bellies ;) Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our meals at Lamesa! Will come back to try their dinner menu next time!"}
{"text":"Great brunch and reasonable price! I ordered salmon Benny. The salmon is so great! That Filipino bread (sry I forgot the specific name) was on point, a little bit sweetness added some exciting taste for the bread! And the eggs were not too hard not too soft! Everything is near perfect!"}
{"text":"Lamesa is a MUST when in Toronto. It's unique blend of flavors will provide an unexpected party in your mouth and it won't burn a hole in your pocket. Here's why you must go here:

1) French Toast: I am usually not a fan of fruit in my French toast, but their Ensaymada French Toast was literally the BEST French toast I've ever had....EVER. It's housemade brioche with ube cheese mousse, dolce de lech, rhubarb compote, pinipig, berries. It comes in two pieces and take small bites to savor every part of it. It's out of this world!

2) Fresh Calamansi Juice: It's a Filipino lime, but sweet and their juice is fresh and so good!

3) Location: It's a quaint restaurant in a hip neighborhood, West Queen West. You can easily dine here and then head over to Kensington Market or Graffiti Alley. 

4) Service: The staff are attentive and very friendly in a non-aggressive way.


I also had the Silog Breakfast and it was quality and very tasty too!"}
{"text":"Very nice decorations and ambiance. It's a cozy little space, reservation is recommended. We came here Friday around 6:30 and luckily there was a table but we were told to finish before 8pm. The waitress was very helpful and provided lots of info on the dishes. We god chicken adobo and chefs special. The presentation of food was also impressive. The price of this place is a bit on the higher side but the experience was good."}
{"text":"Decent food, meager portions.

Notable pear-ginger tea (salabat) and flan."}
