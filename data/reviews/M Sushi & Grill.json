{"text":"It was my first time to visit there and I really enjoyed their rolls!! Love BCS! I can't wait to go back there again :)"}
{"text":"What a gem this place turned out to be. Searched Yelp for Sushi in Champaign and saw that M Sushi had the best rating. We were fans of Yellowfin, so we decided to try out this spot after reading a few reviews with good things to say.  We arrived at 7:15pm or so and found the restaurant largely empty. A pleasant surprise, since the interior is pleasant and clean; something I might have missed in a crowded room.  Table service was outstanding throughout. Wife had the Bubble Tea (awesome!), and I stuck with water.  Miso Soup x 2. Best I've had. Granted, I'm no expert, but it was delicious.   I opted for the \"No Return\" roll, which was brought out quickly. Simple, thoughtful presentation. The waitress warned \"this hot sauce (on the side) is the real deal. Be careful with it!\"   I love spicy food. I usually go for \"Wild\" at BWW and put Tabasco on everything. This stuff WAS the real deal. A small dab was enough to activate the burn. I turned to the wasabi for relief! I'd put it into habanero territory. Even still, it was flavorful, and complimented the other flavors of the fish. Again, delicious.   Wife had the shrimp tempura and rainbow rolls. Presentation on both were again simple but eye pleasing.   We also ordered the corn jeon, highly recommended by other reviewers. It was excellent also, but it came out after everything else, almost like a dessert. Our server apologized for this and took it off our bill, which was totally unexpected and not necessary. It only lent to the already great impression we had of the place.  Diverse menu, outstanding and friendly service, pleasant atmosphere and reasonably priced. We stuffed ourselves for $40, before tip. Can't recommend this place more. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on a Sunday night for dinner. The interior was nice, relaxing, and we enjoyed the chill music playlist. The waitress was very nice and accommodating.   I had to take two stars off for the food, unfortunately. After reading stellar reviews I was honestly really excited to try the food. I ordered the highly reviewed corn jeon which seemed to be under-fried and was a little bland. The Treasure Island Roll, also highly reviewed, fell way below expectations for me. I was hoping for a nice texture with the shrimp tempura inside the roll, but it was soggy or seemed to be under-fried as well. The lemon slices on top were way too strong, so much that the roll tasted of sharp sourness, so we took them off for the rest of the roll. The roll felt mushy and tasted sharply sour in my mouth. This also might be because of a sour cream/cream cheese type of ingredient in the roll which was not listed on the menu. We realized there was no masago on the roll as advertised on the menu. Furthermore, our sashimi bowl came with no rice underneath the mixed salad as advertised, and when we asked about it, they quickly fixed it by adding rice...and some new ingredients on top, which we were confused about. I wonder if the chef had forgotten to add some ingredients as well from the start.  We told the waitress about our missing masago on the sushi roll and the manager gave us a discount on the roll, so I am glad that our customer service experience was positive. We were told the chef was on his second day of work at the time, so maybe it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"Such good food! Went yesterday with two friends around 7:30pm. They had to make a new batch of sushi rice and felt really bad about it so they brought us all complementary miso soups and this delicious corn pancake. The sushi was incredible and so fresh. Will definitely recommend to friends and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best restaurant in the area! The quality of food here could compete with some good sushi places in Chicago. What a surprise! Avocado ball: elegant presentation, good mixture of tuna and avocado Sashimi: I had salmon sashimi and it is impressive! One of my favorite dishes. They cut it into thick slices and made the flavor to another level! Miso soup: complimentary, lots of flavors and ingredients inside. Best miso soup in Champaign Sushi: all have good qualities. Sweet shrimp sushi is insanely awesome. Another favorite dish. I ordered it twice! Cannot stop! BSC roll: lots of small scallops, an interesting flavor.  No Return roll: really really spicy. They use authentic jalapeno. One dip of sauce could burn your mouth. However, still very good. I finished them all Overall, this restaurant impressed me. BTW, service is good as well. I even want to come back tomorrow to try more other dishes. If you love sushi and Japanese food, this is a must go place."}
{"text":"I am not the usual yelp writer. And I'm a snob when it comes down to eating out. When it comes down to sushi and sashimi, you can definitely call me a super snob.   I have visited M Sushi & Grill for a few times already since it's opening as a sushi place and I gotta say, I am happy to spend money eating out at this place, and I am excited that I won't have to drive to one of my favorite sushi/sashimi places in Chicago anymore. To be honest, I think M Sushi has better quality sashimi than any other places in the midwest and the price are also reasonable. In my personal opinion, scallop and mackerel are the two kinds that are tricky to be fresh and I often use the two as a way to \"grade\" a sushi place. And again, this is my absolute personal way of judging. With this place, not only scallop and mackerel, but everything is really to die for. They just melt in your mouth and the satisfaction as a sushi eater is indescribable.   When I went earlier today with a friend, we started out shy with ordering a couple of rolls and a couple pieces of sushi, then we kept ordering more before we knew. I tried to take photos but some rolls, we ended up finishing it before I thought of taking photos (e.g. sexy roll, which was amazing with the sprinkled fried onions on top!).   This place offers very good Korean food, all-cooked-roll for the people who are not familiar with eating sashimi, and amazing quality sashimi for people like me. Definitely enough to offer for everyone in the group. I don't know how to add pictures as part of the review, but this is definitely one of the best places in town and as a sushi snob, I highly recommend this place.   Oh, I got too excited to talk about their food -- their staff is very friendly, too!"}
{"text":"Food is quite salty. We came here on graduation weekend so their service is quite slow though. Overall I would say it's an average Japanese/ Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"M Sushi underwent a power outage three hours before we showed up, and so the menu was limited and the staff seemed a bit flustered, so my review takes that into mind.  Even given the power outage, this place was pretty good. The service was solid, though it took a while to order. We had the fried gyoza, the chicken teriyaki roll (first time I've ever seen a non-seafood sushi roll) and the shrimp tempura roll, all of which were solid. I also liked the strawberry mochi.   The fried gyoza was a personal favorite, though the sushi seemed a bit large and hard to eat- the chicken teriyaki wasn't quite balanced between the meat and the avocado/cucumber. Still, that's a minor issue- it was all really quite good, even given the power outage. I can't wait to try it when the menu is full."}
{"text":"All the rolls and sushis we had were great! Almost the best I've ever had! But other than those, the hot pot, ramen, and miso soup were not so good. So definitely go there and try (only) the rolls, sushis and sashimi!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi at a reasonable price.  Came here with group of friends late at night on Saturday. Our server was amazing off-bat being very personable and going through the highlights of the menu. Our table ordered a bunch of different items off the menu.  We ordered the spicy tuna fries, which was pretty decent but would have benefited from more of the miso cheese sauce. The salmon belly and tuna nigiri were perfect. The fish was soft and delicious. In term of rolls, the Sweet Hawaiian roll was by far the best. The garlic dressing really made gave a unique flavor to the roll. The Hot Night roll was also really good. It was decently spicy with slices of raw jalapeno on the top. The maki rolls that we ordered (spicy tuna, salmon, california, and tuna) were just okay. They really didn't stand out one way or another from other sushi restaurants.   Overall, the service was excellent and the house sushi rolls were delicious! I don't understand why they have what seems like a permanent 50% discount on their house rolls but this makes the prices reasonable for some good sushi. The best advice would be to get either their nigiri or house special rolls and avoid the standard maki rolls. I would love to try a couple of the signature rolls on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Liked it a lot. BSC roll is yummy. Also tried Las Vegas roll, but deep fried it doesn't taste that good. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere new for dinner.  We decided to come here after reading some of the reviews. It ended up being a great decision! There was no wait and we were seated at a nice booth.  We both ordered bulgogi but I tried the hot pot version and my boyfriend tried the hot plate version. The hot pot comes out with a little stove and the wait staff came every couple minutes to cook the beef. We both thought the hot pot version was a little better than the hot plate version. My boyfriend also tried the chicken teriyaki sushi which was half off and also good. Overall I would recommend this place to my friends and definitely return!"}
{"text":"This sushi place is great. The staff is wonderful, cheerful, and efficient. We ordered pick up and they had it ready for us and payment was a breeze. We even added the free miso soup deal last minute and they were so accommodating."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Good quality!! Love it!! I want to go again!! Highly recommend to eat bhc sushi"}
{"text":"The sushi was really quite good. I had a roll and several nigiri pieces and everything was well made and fresh. I ate at the sushi bar and visited with the sushi chef Jay. Very enjoyable meal. I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Champaign."}
{"text":"I was really satisfied and impressed with M sushi. It is definitely the best sushi restaurant in Champaign-Urbana with a reasonable price. My bill came out to be $80 (including taxes). My boyfriend and I ordered the BSC roll, Treasure Island signature roll, Hot Night roll and No return  Signature Roll. Additionally, I ordered a beef toro and an uni nigiri, 2 miso soups and a green tea ice-cream and strawberry flavored mochi ice-cream. The sushi is unique and flavorful especially the treasure island roll, the hint of lemon definitely was the highlight of the sushi. The BSC roll is creamy and savory with little scallops on top of the sushi roll. Both the beef toro and uni nigiri melted in my mouth. Highly recommend this place! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Good sushi for a very affordable price!! My favorites were the palm spring roll, sweet Hawaiian roll, and the hot night roll! This place is very underrated and the waitress was funny too! Definitely check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Food decor is amazingand the house special rolls are really good deal. I couldn't take the picture of \"crunch spicy tuna sushi\" but I highly recommend to try this out. They are not serving sushi right now but I am really looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Went here today for a quick bite to eat and ended up getting carry out. The service was extremely friendly and very attentive. I was given my food in less than 10 minutes. I ordered the rainbow roll and the Alaskan roll, and both were delicious! The fish was fresh and very flavorful. Best sushi I've had in Champaign in a very long time. Will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Great fresh approach to such a competitive food item in this area...sushi! So good and at decent pricing. Also can't forget to mention the green tea ice cream. YUM!!"}
{"text":"Delivery option is why we tried this restaurant for lunch.  Crab was like eating a crab salad.  Not really impressed.  I had an Alaska roll which was good but I've had better."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, I was surprised when Yori Q became M Sushi. That meant that I had to check it out, especially for the deal for the house special rolls they had going on.  The corn jeon here has and always will be a staple here. It is a huge corn pancake drizzled with spicy mayo, and easily shared by 2 people.   I wanted to try the house special rolls, so my boyfriend and I got the Las Vegas, Sweet Hawaiian, and Shrimp Tempura. Sweet Hawaiian was my favorite, it was just the right size to pop into your mouth. The dressing and seared tuna on top was delicious. With that being said, the shrimp tempura pieces were effin' huge. It got to the point where my boyfriend and I were trying to see how big our mouths could stretch for one piece. The Las Vegas roll, being fried and filled with cream cheese, would not be considered as the most \"authentic\" sushi roll out there, but I liked it a lot. The batter used to fry it made it where the pieces had just the right amount of crisp to it, but not too overpowering. These pieces were also pretty big, but not as big as the shrimp tempura pieces. The quality of the fish was fine, which was surprising since we ARE in the middle of Illinois, haha.   Service was good and very quick. They frequently checked up on us and asked us if we had any questions. We did not feel rushed at all. The bill came out to be ~$30 before tip, which was reasonable for me. We were also very full after our meal.   Perhaps next time I'll go for a signature roll."}
{"text":"Nice staff but food was not that great. First off the sign outside is Yori Q which is confusing because that the old name. The maki rolls are done very different then what I have seen before. I'm not saying that's bad but it's different with how I know certain rolls to be made. I will say that the fish was fresh but it's hard for me to give more stars when they have no drink menu, presentation of food was not great, and mostly all the rolls have avocado with eel sauce.  I don't live in the area and only here for business but if you are in the area I would recommend you go for fresh sushi and maybe try your luck with the maki."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get lunch for a meeting. Food is great and well priced. I would recommend the spicy project bulgogi box. It's so tasty and comes with some fun sides to add diversity to the meal. Service is top-notch!"}
{"text":"The Sushi is great! I have eaten sushi all over town and this is one of the best. The sushi chef was very personable and even brought our food to us.   We also tried the fried dumplings very very good. I would recommend this place to anyone I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Dear Manager, Hello, I Really Miss Your Old Menu I Loved The Tempura Shrimp Alot Please Bring It Back, Sincerely Declan F."}
{"text":"Holy hot diggity damn. That was some fine ass food. Sushi was great. Bibimbop was amazing. And the hot bowls were tasty and hot the entire time thanks to the hot plate that they set it on. Go there now."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this new place and overall had a good experience. The waiter was nice and tried to get my feedback on the food. We ordered the budae hotpot and two rolls and it was more than enough food.   Sushi: I took advantage of the half off rolls and was so pleased with the sweet Hawaiian roll. Even tho it says it's spicy, it really wasn't. The tuna on top was seasoned with pepper. The other hamachi (yellow tail) and scallion roll was less favorable. It had a lot of sesame oil so I couldn't tell if the fish was fresh. The rice was also was wet and sticky. A little less vinegar would do. Maybe because I came one hour before closing.   Hotpot: the budae was filled with salty goodness. spam, hot dog, and half a ramen... but why half? It was enough for two people to share. Really craved tofu, spam, and Korean spice.   There's not many decent sushi choices in champaign but this place is easily a place I would go to fix my craving."}
{"text":"The place is used to call Yori-Q but I think it changed the names to M Sushi & Grill a few months ago, I was pretty surprised!  Nonetheless, fairly cozy and spacious to dine with friends or a group of friends.  The food is good and the sushi is highly recommended, and the portion is fairly good for one person.  If Sakanaya is full or have to wait for more than 20 minutes (very likely during the school season) in line, then this is the next place I would recommend to go to have good food and good time :)"}
{"text":"This place used to be called Yori-Q. As recent transplants to Chambana from NY my family and I  haven't had a chance to try it yet. They now are called M Sushi and serve very good sushi and tempura in addition to some of their old Korean favorites. We have ordered sushi and sashimi combo for $35. Very good quality of fish in moderate quantity. Excellent tempura appetizer for $8: light and crunchy. Very good eel cucumber and spider rolls (the former at $6 is a steal). Last but not least, they serve a tasty tempura green tea dessert. Good selection of Korean beer (plus Asahi and Blue Moon). I just returned from a trip to Seoul and found the same three beer brands here in Champaign. Kids had Korean dishes: beef and chicken bulgogi. Both came on hot plates and were tasty. Beef bulgogi was served the same way I had in Korea less than a week ago..."}
{"text":"So we were actually going to go back to Yellowfin to get some sushi, but ended up on the parking lot looking for a new place given the \"restaurant closing\" sign over Yellowfin's front door :(  I've never been to Yori Q, but this \"new\" place opened about a week ago and is under the same management as Yori Q, with a new concept - more sushi and lower prices with some of the same korean menu items! Came here with the bf for lunch on Saturday (almost 70 degrees in February, global warming is real kids) to sample their new lunch menu and some of their rolls - ended up just having enough stomach room to try their boxed lunch and sushi combo lunch specials...a ton of delicious food! They have several japanese+korean fusion bento boxes, and all come with their apple salad vinaigrette, two fried dumplings, and 4 pieces of either their california or spicy tuna roll. The spicy pork was delicious...and obviously something preserved from Yori Q, barbecued and marinated with spicy sweet korean marinade and grilled for that perfect juicy, fatty taste that, when paired with rice (which was actually cooked well thank goodness) makes korean barbecue such a treat to the umami senses.  Sushi platter came with 5 pieces of the chef's selection - in our case, salmon, tuna, smoked salmon, smoked tuna, and shrimp nigiris placed elegantly next to 6 pieces of their listed rolls or specialty rolls ($4 extra). The fish was fresh, and we were given thick slabs delicately placed on smaller morsels of rice (definitely more fish than rice, not the other way around), and the pieces of sushi had a smaller rice to filling ratio - which really accentuated the flavor of the sushi and made it more about the fish than the belly-filling rice. Still ended up pleasantly full though, but still had enough room to swing by Jarlings afterwards.  Fresh, relatively simple and pure flavors, faithful on the classics, and not as expensive as Sakanaya on Green Street. With Yellowfin closed, this place is definitely a place to check out, and the family sitting behind us said its better than Kofusion!  ps. a lot of things are 50% off, not sure if this is a promotional thing since the restaurant just opened, but I'd go now while its still half priced!"}
{"text":"This was fantastic, absolutely one of the best sushi places in town. We had the bulgogi hot pot which they cook at your table, Hawaiian roll and Philadelphia roll, everything is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their sushi rolls, especially the BCS, definitely a great one if you like urchins."}
{"text":"Too few servers?There are not a lot of people when we come. We just order sashimi which takes literally 5 minutes in other restaurants. But here we wait for like an hour. Waste of time"}
{"text":"Came here last week and had sushi and nabeyaki udon. Both were really good! They are doing a 50% off rolls right now so we ordered the rainbow rolls which was also delicious. I'll definitely come back here for sushi!"}
{"text":"This place is where you have to go when you want good quality sushi. The house special rolls are up to 50% off right now! You won't find any place that has this kind of price for such high quality sushi in Champaign. This is 100% guaranteed. I had spicy tuna tempura roll and treasure island roll. They are both amazing. I can't wait to go back here and try different rolls. ^__^"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious,, I loved the sweet Hawaiian roll and the shrimp killer roll"}
{"text":"Tried bento box and not recommended...  no wasabi  no dipping sauce comes with the sushi and fried dumpling, kind of disappointed."}
{"text":"Was looking for a change in the norm from the campus town sushi restaurant I normally eat at when I'm down in Champaign Urbana and I found this. Definitely glad I searched YELP hot and new businesses. Sushi was great, they had some variations on the preparation of select fish. Everything tasted great and I will definitely be back."}
