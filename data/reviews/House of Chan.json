{"text":"Finally the new location opened!!! Unfortunately...It is a mini of the original.  Food is great as usual  but way too tight. Two people can barely pass SIDEWAYS in the aisle."}
{"text":"Very good and attentive service, but the food was mediocre. A number of people told us how wonderful the steaks were, but they were nothing special, given the high prices - and came back closer to rare than to the medium ordered. Side salad was tasteless, and potatoes and onions tasted oily. Chinese dishes were bland (with salty but uninspired sauces).  Unlikely to return at these prices."}
{"text":"Chances are if you're reading this review then you are either: a regular who is curious what people are saying about the place or a potential new customer inquiring for the first time. This review is for the first timers.  The Chan is first and foremost an excellent Surf and Turf restaurant; second a dimly lit lounge, with full bar, in the classic American-Chinese style; third a Chinese food restaurant. Hang your expectations on this order of excellence and you will not be disappointed.  The steak and lobster never disappoint and your order always comes with salad, fried onions, and potato slices.   At time of writing the restaurant has recently moved down the street from its old landmark locale. Fear not: the new location, while a bit smaller, has lost none of the atmosphere, food quality, and friendly service. The decor still looks like the Chinese restaurants in Glengarry Glen Ross and Seinfeld.  The Chan is a legendary fixture of the Toronto steakhouse scene and absolutely worth your time and money--even if you can't afford to visit regularly enough to work your own butt groove into the benches."}
{"text":"WOW!  Shared a rib eye steak here, KING cut 16 oz for $60+.  It was an incredible, amazing piece of meat.  Crisp exterior, tender interior and SO much flavor! Amoungst the best I have ever had.  Extremely expensive but worth it for the most part.  The bland discs of sliced and minute fried potatoes were shameful for the price of this dinner as was the plate of vegetables, which we assumed would be streamed mixed fresh veggies or something, but ended up being huge hunks of raw onion, some raw whole celery stalks and a couple of slices of tomato - again - shameful.  We also had a $20 plate of shrimp chop suey.  Delicious beyond belief with many huge shrimps and fresh, wonderful vegetables.  Cheesy \"Chinese\" food restaurant decor, very dark but comfortable.  Attentive staff.  Very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I will not order from here again. Delivery took well over one hour. The food was received cold. Portions are small. The cantonese chow mein was very soggy- the noodles were not crunchy at all. Shrimp fried rice was Tasty, however it was cold.  Overall, very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Ugh. Awful. They used to be the famous Chinese steak house. The steak was measly and very expensive for the cut and weight. The Chinese style food may be good, but we went for the famous steak."}
{"text":"The location of the restaurant is the only thing that's been updated since my last visit a few years back. They still serve steak, lobster and Chinese food. We ordered all of the above.  The quality of the steak is great, however the cooking method is so-so. The steak is seared and cooked in ultra high heat which makes the outside chewy and almost crispy. It scratches the roof of your mouth if you take too big a bite. I didn't care for this style of cooking on my steak at all, near burnt is not the way to go on a rib steak. The inside was exactly medium rare as requested so that was good.  They prepare the lobster the same as any other Chinese restaurant, but they make the sauce very thick. The lobster was cooked perfectly I would say. The only down side is that it's soo expensive. It was at least $10/lb more than at any other seafood restaurant. And it didn't taste $10/lb better.  The other Chinese dishes were a hit and miss. Chow mein was so-so, fried rice was ok (nothing special), beef and broccoli was mediocre, and general tso chicken was good. The prices for all these dishes are at least double what you would pay at any other Chinese restaurant.  The service here is good. The wait staff are friendly and happy. If I had to take a guess, I would say that the wait staff see these crazy prices and in exchange, provide good service to the customers because they feel bad that they're being ripped off for Chinese food.  Overall, I would say the price to quality ratio isn't there. At these prices you can get a steak at a premium steak house (ie. Jacob & Co., Harbour 60, Peter's fine dining) at a better quality and price. Also, the vast amount of Chinese seafood restaurants that exist in the GTA are endless and cheaper."}
{"text":"It's impossible to have a bad meal here. The lobsters....the steak..... the potatoes ...... the fried noodles....the bacon wrapped shrimp- THE LIST GOES ON AND ON!!!! This place is not cheap, don't let its hole in the wall look deceive you  but oh you will my leave hungry. The staff who have been here for ages always make sure you're taken care of. Just make sure you order steak and lobster and your tummy will be super happy!! They don't take reservations so be prepared to wait because it's a small Resturant and it's always a wait- it's always busy!!!!!!"}
{"text":"House of Chan is notorious for the juxtaposition of having great steaks and seafood while eating chinese food.   Service is very attentive though the restaurant gets more crowded around 6pm. Chow Mein with plum sauce and mustard was brought to the table right away.   The steaks are cooked to perfection under the salamander/broiler. However, the super charred nature of the steak is not my favourite. The steamed lobsters are a hearty helping but the melted butter is more like brown butter with a bit of nutty bitterness at the end which I find not suitable for the lobster. The ribs taste like Char Siu which I really like because I love Char Siu. The accompaniments: green salad and veggies are very tasty.   Overall, I would return as it was an interesting experience and maybe order more from the Chinese side of the menu next time."}
{"text":"This place is special, and it will always hold a special place in my heart. There's nothing like the House of Chan (read: The Chan) and, I doubt there will ever be anything like it.  From the second you hoist open the heavyweight green door, you feel like you've entered your second home (house) of Chan. Staff are friendly, mirrors are complimentary, and the bar is lively and exciting. Oh, what a place!  Over the years, me, my family and I have shared some incredible memories at the Chan. We've tried it all. Dish nights. Steak nights. Dish AND Steak nights. Martinis. Wine. We've over-indulged in the crispy wonton noodles, and we haven't had enough of the Butterfly Shrimp.   We're always left wanting more, and just writing this review makes me crave the lean yet juicy Ribs. Penny is a class act/owner, and is always super friendly to talk to.  Thank you HOUSE OF CHAN!"}
{"text":"Ordered a beef dish and a shrimp fried rice . Ended up with food poisoning, throwing up projectile vomit, severe stomach pains and heart burn. Went to the emergency at 5 am and spent 5 hours in the hospital . I have never in my life had food poisoning and I generally eat healthy work out daily and rarely get sick . This is the second review I have seen identical to mine so I know it's not an isolated incident . Thanks house of chan for the food poisoning. I hope you eat you own food sometime and experience first hand and maybe clean up your act. Probably time for a health and safety inspection."}
{"text":"This is our first time visiting this restaurant and we would highly recommend it.   The flavoured were great but what surprised us was the freshness of the food when it came out. The chicken was tender, juicy and bold with flavour. The beef was cooked to perfection! And the staff were fun and energetic.   Would definitely go back and would recommend anyone especially with their new location. The place is super busy!!"}
