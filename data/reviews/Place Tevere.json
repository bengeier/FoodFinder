{"text":"wasn't the ownership change at the time in 2004... It was the cook, and recipe change that killed it. Went there for lunch, new owners... Horrible... Zero stars"}

{"text":"Stopped here for lunch today.

The \"all dressed\" pizza slice was a very generous portion and tasted very good.  Not quite gourmet but excellent for food court fare.

The disappointment however was the Caesar side salad. It was made of a handful of regular iceberg lettuce mixed with a little romaine. It came dressed with what seemed like a bottled dressing sprinkled with imitation bacon bits. Avoid this dish.

All in all a fair value for around $10 including a small drink."}
{"text":"Whors Place ever... Really bad Food and the lighting is way too low I can't even see my damn so called food. What are they trying to hide with the bad lighting?"}
{"text":"Place Tevere/Ristorante Tevere, Dorval. is no more.  After near 45 years of serving Dorval (35 of those years they made some of the greatest pizza of all time), they closed their doors forever.

RIP \"Tevere's\" c1970 - Oct 2014.

You will be missed."}
{"text":"This PlaceTevere's location in Place Vertu is really convienient. Perfect for a quick piece of reallly good pizza!"}
