{"text":"A great cafe buried in one of the smaller streets of Yorkville, but a great place to study! The service and drinks were great, and it was quiet enough to do a few hours of work there. Located right next to the Bay subway station so I'd say the only fault is the rumbling of the passing subway every few minutes!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for an afternoon coffee and it was lovely. The atmosphere is very nice, and it would be a great place to take someone for a coffee date. They have a wonderful selection of cakes but unfortunately I didn't try any (I guess I'll save that for my next visit!). I ordered a chai tea latte. I didn't enjoy the latte very much because it did not have very much flavour for a chai. I wouldn't recommend it. On the bright side, I ordered a chocolate chip cookie to go with it and that was delicious and chewy! (I suppose you can't really mess up a chocolate chip cookie, but this one was particularly good!)"}
{"text":"Love this place! I popped by with my boyfriend on a Sunday afternoon, and even though we just expecting to pick up some coffee, we ended up with a seriously tasty sit down experience. 

This place has Hungarian roots and the food menu reflected that with items like goulash, cabbage rolls and other specials on a chalkboard. They also have menu items that any Yorkviller would appreciate, like avocado toast. I shared the cabbage rolls, which came with rye bread, sour cream and sauerkraut. The cabbage rolls were piping hot and fell apart perfectly, like cutting through butter but with a nice, al dente texture in the mouth. Just what I wanted. 

Buoyed with confidence after the success of the cabbage rolls, I took some goulash to go, too. Best decision. Goulash is basically Hungarian stew, so in this case and many others, it has beef, potatoes, carrots, though there are many variations. This one was also had crazy tender meat, and the whole thing warmed me up from the inside out."}
{"text":"I ordered the crepes for breakers and expresso macchiato. The crepe is very soft and i do not really like the they only putting apricot jams in one of it. The expresso macchiato is ok, above average, but not that exaggerated that the best in town/province."}
{"text":"Quaint place in the middle of the city with a great breakfast menu and baked goodies. The coffee is superb and reminds me of Europe."}
{"text":"I found this cafe by accident; wanting to avoid the plethora of Tim Hortons and Starbucks. Set up as Parisian style, it also has a great window view for people watching. This small cafe serves the best cappuccino I have ever had! The fresh croissants are a nice compliment. Delicious comfort food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a delicious lunch and coffee today at hom.  Hom is a cute cafe that also serves all-day brunch/breakfast and lunch, not to mention delicious coffee!  There is a beautiful display of dessert too (although on this visit we were too full from lunch to indulge).  I learnt that the cafe is inspired by the owner's late grandmother and the recipes are those that she made while he was growing up.  Some of her artwork and vases were tastefully on display too. 
While many of the recipes are Hungarian, there are several many choices that any Yorkviller would appreciate.  

We started with the split pea soup that had little dumplings and a lot of vegetables.  For mains, we shared an avocado and tomato salad and an avocado toast with a poached egg.  The service was friendly, attentive and I also enjoyed learning about the inspiration behind the cafe.  I look forward to coming back and trying more menu items (and indulging in the dessert!)."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food fare for what I thought was just coffee and pastries.  Not so. A pretty full menu of some really great European style food."}
{"text":"I just finished a delicious Greek salad with a scoop of tuna. HöM has the best coffee in the city, maybe even the province. The Höm-made desserts are top."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this cafe and absolutely loved the food.  My Mom who is Polish tried the stuffed cabbage rolls on special which were amazing!  Loved the crepes and the chicken schnitzel sandwich.  Excellent coffee.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, delicious food, and the best cappuccino I've ever tasted! The staff is so friendly and will accommodate for anything!"}
{"text":"Where to begin? They squished 3 of us into a 2 person spot. We were served long after the couple that sat beside us, and arrived 10 minutes after us. Coffee took a very long time, water took even longer, and our meal came out AFTER the couple beside us was finished their meal (remember, they arrived after us). Food and coffee were mediocre. Service was lacking. Wouldn't recommend or return"}
{"text":"Höm is where the tasty food and coffee is! 
Make sure you check out this amazing Eastern European style coffee shop in Yorkville. The dessert is out of this world...you have to try the Dobos cake. 
Even tho the food can be quite pricey it's for sure worth a visit because the quality is great!"}
{"text":"Busy little cafe in the heart of a pretty cool area, yorkville. The menu is pretty large so there's lots of options to choose from. Their coffee is also a hidden gem. I think it's some of the best coffee in the area."}
{"text":"Food is okay, decent but service is terrible. I had an avocado toast w/fruit salad! Didn't have the heart not to tip but def wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee espresso bar. Got to the the breakfast and the espresso shot. 

Also their croissant selections are on point."}
{"text":"When the place is half empty and you have to ask the bar staff to clean the table 10 times, you know their noses are way too up their asses just because they are situated in Yorkville. 

Extreme rude customer service, profiling in full effect, I seriously thought I was crossing the border to the states!!!


Word of advice, train your staff to be more courteous to people of a bit tan colour!!!"}
{"text":"Americano (to go) was okay (not great) and overpriced. Pastries looked delicious but didn't try them"}
