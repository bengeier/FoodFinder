{"text":"Tried to have an occasion here but had a poor time with Jennifer the event manager following through on finding out answers to some of my questions. I wanted to know how many ounces the chicken breast was for dinner, steak, etc.  Not unusual if you are planning an event and care about your guests.  Two weeks, no follow through from Jennifer. Then I had the pleasure of attending a wedding here. I saw Jennifer as she yelled at one of the guests who was late and unknowingly entered as the ceremony began. She also yelled at my husband to \"stay put\" so he didn't wander to find a seat. (simple signage would have avoided this) Poor form in my opinion, and just as I had feared, the portion of the dinner was minimal.  This place is lackluster AT BEST!"}
{"text":"Great place! I didn't of the opportunity to play a game of golf, but the staff were absolutely fantastic! As soon as I walked into the facility everyone was very polite and friendly. Definitely looking forward to coming again!"}
{"text":"Great golf course - no spectacular views (in fact, the whole course is surrounded by houses), but sometimes those act merely to hide the weakness of a course.  Between dog-legs and water, I don't recall a course that had so many holes with so many options off the tee.  If you like clever designs, you'll never be able to play this course just once - in fact, you could play 5 or 6 times and on some holes, take a different strategy off the tee each time (and each one be correct!).  So, what's with the two stars?  The food is actually ok - about par (:)) with expectations.  However, the service is shocking, so you may never find this out for yourself.  And this applies across the board.  Don't get me wrong, there are a number of GREAT folks here, but it's like a lottery as to whether you get served by them - pro-shop, dining room, wherever.  Any complaints are met with deafening silence, so honestly, the golf course adds a star to this facility.  Really a shame, as this place has everything in place to hit the ball out the park - everything except a will to do so."}
{"text":"Awesome country club. Great new remodled gym, heated Olympic pool for year round use.  Love the family like atmosphere, plenty of planned family events/pool parties.   Only complaint, wish members who didn't pay for the monthy tennis membership could still rent a court on a need by need basis.   Regardless courts are top notch, great facilities and friendly staff."}
{"text":"With less than 3 months to our wedding, we made a quick decision to change our ceremony location and fortunately Arrowhead was available!    Amy was awesome to work with. She is friendly and doesn't miss any details! The entire experience was easy and stress free. I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"The constant complaint on the west side is that there are no upscale dinner options.  Finally gave this place a try after hearing they did a remodel.  There is no hostess, you are expected to know what to do and where to go.  The staff literally ignores you.   The patio is dank and smells like smoke.  It has potential to be the best patio in town, but ownership is apparently too cheap to pop for a few low voltage lights, so the trees, fairways, and lake are just part of the dark nondescript morass that is this spot.  After 15 minutes of not even an offer of water I decided I would leave.  I stayed an extra 10 just to see how bad it could get.  At 25 minutes I couldn't take it anymore and left.  Did anyone say goodbye, thanks for coming, oh I'm sorry were you not helped?  Nope, not even a head fake.  Such an utter disappointment.  These guys could hire a Dennys manager and people would come here just because of the facility.  But alas they have no manager at all."}
{"text":"What better way to follow up a review of the dumpy Metrocenter than with the classy Arrowhead Country Club.   I just went here for lunch the other day with a friend whose husband is the chef here.  So needless to say, this review is of the clubhouse dining - not the golfing.  The food here is pretty good.  It's your average country club fare -- upscale, but a bit conservative.    I was so tempted to walk in the joint with a sweater draped over my back and shoulders and tell them my name is Carlton, but I held it in.  I ordered the chicken with a wine mushroom sauce and rice pilaf.  Good, but par for the course (no pun intended).   Service was polite and quick, as it always is when I've been here for business meetings.  I've also been here for a number of rubber chicken banquet dinners - so I know what to expect.    The clubhouse facility itself is decent (not as fabulous as you might think), but the banquet set-up is a bit small, semi-circular, and is downstairs, so you feel like you're in some kind of basement.  I keep asking for a certain member named Jordin Sparks, but she never seems to be around....dang it."}
{"text":"Great club with exceptional pricing for juniors (younger than 40 for club and younger than 30 for fitness center).  All the staff are really nice and accommodating.  Fitness club is located adjacent to the main building. Lots of machines and scheduled classes. They also offer child sitting services for $2 hourly per child."}
{"text":"We have been members here for a year. We moved from LA Fitness, I could only take so many meat heads picking up on girls. We have been really happy with Arrowhead CC. The staff is friendly, the equipment is pretty new, the classes are great. We LOVE the kids nursery! The morning staff is fantastic, they are all \"grandma\" types, and have been there for 5 years+. This is a GREAT club for families! I believe we pay about $100 a month for a couple, which isn't much more than LA fitness, and with Arrowhead CC you get so much more!"}
{"text":"I joined as a golf member in April 2016. It was nice that they allowed the CaveMan to excavate and smash balls into houses:) I will continue to post reviews as I spend my days here...for now, it is groovy!"}
{"text":"I am a fitness member at arrowhead country club. If you're going to join let them know I referred you! I can get you a one week guest pass for $35/week. If you decide to train - I train with Brianna. She's a great trainer who is really helping me with all my fitness goals. Looking forward to doing more training and social activities."}
{"text":"Well, don't leave anything of value on your cart here. You'll never see it again. This is highly unfortunate because this is a private course. I was going to chock this up as a misstep on my part, but after talking to another member who had left 2 different GPS units at two different times recently only to find that they never reappeared, proves they have very dishonest cart crew. I can't say it surprised me when I walked into the cart area today and heard them complaining openly to one another about how cheap the members are that don't tip them. I guess they just steal stuff to make up for it. Management needs to clean house and start over."}
{"text":"Amy is a fabulous event planner at this country club. I am not a member of the club, but I enjoyed their beautiful venue for an event I attended and helped organize. The food is decent and the layout is very nice. The event area is very large, open, and allows for use of a projector and basement."}
{"text":"The Country Club will be happy to cater to you as long as you plan on spending the big bucks. We have a large backyard so we just wanted a spot for a ceremony. Jennifer was very attentive and responded fast until we met. She then found out we were for sure only doing the ceremony. Promised a contract by the end of the week. I didn't get it and didn't hear back. So I emailed twice with no response and left a VM with no response. Then after I called and left a message for another individual she called me back and said they were having issues with generating contracts. Which would have been fine if I was just told that to begin with. Instead I had to track down an answer. Then she set another deadline for me getting the contract, that passed with no word. I then had to reach out again and got a bit of an attitude. I was told not to worry my date was saved but why wouldn't I worry with with kind of service and lack of venues on this side of town. I then started to question whether I wanted to work with this venue. We are even members! Then a couple weeks later I got a contract with no apology about the 4-5 week timeline it took to get it. I did not respond because I was done with them. I did not receive a follow up email or call to make sure that I received the contract. Then even had a full ceremony/reception planned after our wedding time so you think they would be happy to accommodate squeezing in another ceremony. Beware before booking here. Very sad how few ceremony sites we have on the Westside of Phoenix and this is one to avoid."}
{"text":"Kids Tennis training is expensive but good. They have 3 coaches and group the kids into one of the group based on skills.   Bad Part : The coaching starts at 5 PM and very bad when both parents are working."}
{"text":"I coordinated a corporate event in the Papago room recently. Thanks to Jennifer and Jose, the event was seem less. Every request and concern I had was taken care of in a highly professional manner. I look forward to working with them again."}
{"text":"As most people know there are a lot of ups and downs to planning a wedding.  The event coordinator at ACC made most of this very easy for me.  I was worried things wouldn't come out the way I wanted but Amy, Carrie, Jose, and the rest of the staff made it all come together perfectly!  The food was AMAZING!  I've gotten so many compliments on Jose, my banquet manager, and the rest of the service staff.  My only complaint would be the price, but since the rule is you get what you pay for I can't really complain!  My day was perfect, I wouldn't have changed one thing, and I can't thank them enough for all their hard work!"}
{"text":"The staff in the athletic club is unfortunately not trained very well in general customer service. They are highly skilled in giving out private information of members. You can certainly ask them who goes there, when they like to work out, and so on. They have personal conversations at the desk and frequently have their backs turned to guests as they enter. They never say \"goodbye\" or \"thank you for coming\". This you would halfway expect from the younger staff, but there is plenty of older staff here as well. It's no wonder why they are losing excessive business to the other gyms in the area.   The buildings are also pretty run down and there is little to no phone data service in the lower level of the gym.   The management also has no idea how to email market and constantly sends out everyone's personal information to all of the members of the club.   This used to be a prosperous and fun place to be but management has led it down an unfortunate path."}
{"text":"This review is mostly about the sports club membership, and not the golfing membership, two different things, although you can opt for both, although if you use one more than the other, its kind of pointless and costly to go with both.   So, I've been a member here on and off since I was 8 years old. And this club has transformed before my very eyes over that time span. Normally, you would only find me on the tennis courts rather than in the sports club, but it wasn't too bad of a place.   With the renovations that took place a few years back, a lot had been added and taken away. Like those yummy fruit smoothies that I use to charge to my club card with no remorse, and deal with the consequences of my father receiving the bill later on in the month. Something about losing their food license or some junk... But this building has many classrooms for anything from aerobics to tai chi, spa rooms for great massages and various treatments, racquetball courts, and numerous weight and exercise machines. Plus, if you have kiddies, there's child care provided as well. And of course, there's the tennis courts, the kiddie and lap pool to the south of the club.  I sometimes found myself on the 'golfer' side, for a quick bite at the lounge/bar after hitting the courts pretty hard or in their main dining area for weddings and their receptions held by numerous family friends. It really is a nice venue, they have a patio that overlooks the first hole and a nice courtyard with a small lake with a fountain nearby. Plus the food isn't bad, I always talk about how I dislike chicken, but for some reason they're chicken fingers at the lounge hit the spot every time!  Now to explain my rating...I knocked off a star due to the recent firing of a good majority of the tennis pro instructors that were great, and basically made tennis happen at this country club. I know how the economy is, but seriously, they didn't have to do it the way they did, apparently micro-management of the sports club needs some revamping..."}
{"text":"Played in a Belco golf tournament here today and I'd have to say that this course is well maintained and fun to play. They have a nice mix of tough, easy, short, and long holes and have a good staff for the most part.   The cart girl seemed a little drunk from the night before :)  The carts were nice and provided GPS but it was an incredibly long course to play on the cart path only (crappy rule due to the weather)   pretty wide open fairways and a decent rate of play  with they had 1-2 more bathrooms on the front / back 9  Great greens and practice center  I have heard they have one of the best teaching pro's in the valley from other golfers but have yet to try his services out yet."}
{"text":"This poor review is strictly regarding my experience with the tennis courts. I played a tennis match here and found out from my opponent that almost ALL the courts have dead spots where the ball dies.  I would not recommend playing tennis matches here unless they fix the dead spots."}
{"text":"If you play golf, tennis or just like to go to the gym, consider Arrowhead county club. Membership is reasonable for all you get. They also have seasonal memberships for snowbirds. Since the new ownership took charge many improvements have been made and more on the so I understand. Any membership includes use of the bar and restaurant so improve you social life and get out to meet new people."}
{"text":"We were at Arrowhead CC for a swim meet and as much as I enjoy Arrowhead CC for golf this is not a great place to host swimming championships."}
{"text":"Place is the bomb.com!  I thought the food at Graze was mediocre until I went in for Asian night on Thursday. We ordered shrimp toast, sushi, and green curry and all three were seriously DELICIOUS. They were by far the best meals we've had there. I wish they'd change the whole menu to Asian style because it's clearly chef's specialty. I'm sitting here drooling just thinking about it.  Mmm!  ...Grab you a cocktail with it too - best bartender in the world, Ramon, will keep you topped off. In fact, everyone on staff takes care of you like you're family - But minus that \"help yourself\" bullshit. They won't have you lifting a finger, especially Ken, he's great!  The atmosphere is lively and totally not like the other lame af country clubs. Most of the members are friendly and fun. There are events going on all the time like trivia night, golf stuff, tennis stuff, you name it. My mom made a whole gang of friends here! Don't worry it's not a tough gang though. They're into water aerobics and earth wind & fire."}
{"text":"Omelets are amazing! Brunch on Sunday is our favorite! Live music, request Ken, he makes the experience!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at the new restaurant \"Graze\" last night with my hubby.  We have been members for 20+ years and were very happy with the renovations.  It doesn't look like the same place, great attention to detail.  They have combined the grill, bar and restaurant into one.  The menu was impressive and delicious.  The wings and tuna poke were excellent.  Robert, our server was attentive and informative.  The drink menu was good and the bar service, again excellent.  I don't think they have done a great job getting members in.  My husband saw a sign at the fitness center.  How about a flyer to all members? If you haven't been you need to go see, sorry I think it's members only."}
{"text":"My high school class held a reunion here.  The staff was amazing and the food was excellent.  The catering department (headed by Jennifer)  went above and beyond to provide us with an incredible experience at a very reasonable price.  These folks nailed it.   If you are planning a wedding, reunion or gathering of around 125 people or fewer, The Arrowhead Country Club is an excellent choice.    Our reunion was an overwhelming success because of these folks.  We will return."}
{"text":"I had a Glycolic Peel by Brooke.  She is amazing!  My skin looks great and I owe it all to her.  She also does wonderful brow and lip waxing."}
{"text":"Great views here from the patio and balcony.  People who work here were very friendly and accomodating for our high school prom.  I would like to come back and try golfing. It looks like a beautiful course with a large lake and green grass (see pics).  They had delicious appetizers for the Prom."}
{"text":"A lot of improvements in recent years - renovated fitness equipment, new pavement in the parking lot, and more.  Food is decent in the restaurant, when it happens to be open.  This is really a country club that is within reach of the middle class person such as myself - for just a bit north of one hundred thirty per month you can get the best of everything here except for golf.  Nice place."}
