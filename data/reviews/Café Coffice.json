{"text":"A newfound study place. Can't get enough of their delicious food, homemade deserts and coffee. Guarantee it's the best coffee I've ever had, and the taste is consistent every time I come. Service is fast and friendly, very personable. The space is work friendly and offers nice size tables for studying. Back area is quieter and great for studying. I'd recommend this place to anyone, there really is nothing out there like it."}
{"text":"My favourite place to study! It is designed exactly how I would do it: wide variety of seating (couches, comfy chairs in addition to normal ones, small tables, large communal tables) and distinct areas that offer a range of privacy (including a conference room). Service is friendly, no complaints about the food (that chicken wrap is phenomenal), comfortable and familiar atmosphere cultivated by the owner (I believe) who makes an effort to greet and get to know familiar faces. Only time I'm disappointed here is when it's full, I'm conflicted leaving such a good review because the last thing I want is more competition for space but I need to give props where they are due!"}
{"text":"After spending many hours at the usual chain coffee shops, I came across this unique new place. Its modern design is great and it has a very clean and cozy feel to it. The coffee shop is also very spacious with plenty of tables and chairs. It is very quiet and the staff is friendly. The coffee is great and the pastries are delicious and fresh. Great spot to study and grab a cup of coffee with friends. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The cafe is spacious and well-lit, but everything else is average.
I expected a cafe which combined cafe and office as its name to be great for working, and while there's definitely plenty of outlets and room, the wifi connection was spotty (or at least for me)
Both the coffee and the food are average and average price, although if you go before 12pm, you can get a coffee and croissant for $3, which is a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"Can a patron say more about the benefit of this type of cafe set-up? Espresso is always GREAT, service par none, and the Owner always makes a point of ensuring you are happy and ready to return. 

I have been to espresso bars across America and Canada, none cater to the Client as Cafe Coffice with call ahead option and Free wifi even a conference room to book out and to top off the great food choices if you need a Print job why go out when this cafe offers a printer on-site.

I wish more cafe owners would learn from this incredible management and service offering.  From NYC to Florida or west to California and north to Seattle and across to Vancouver I have not found a match.  

Oh yes, the only downfall is a lack of parking as the location is on  a prime street with metered parking there is a public parking down the street."}
{"text":"Hate it that I have to Rate it 5/5. Because It's still a \"secret\" place to study. You feel right at home, Staff are nice, The owner makes sure everything is perfect, checks with you if everything is good and at your liking. Free Wi-fi, I've never got so much stuff done anywhere else.
Only bad thing are the prices, a bit on the more expensive side, But Understandable, the food's great, everything is fresh, Coffee's awesome."}
{"text":"Great place to get work done! After all, that is what one would expect from a place called \"Coffice\".

They have a great concept that allows both for work and \"play\". Separated from the louder service side of the cafe by a beautiful loft style brick wall, the quiet side of the cafe is home to several very large (and a few small) library style study tables, complete with accessible laptop plugs. One can hear the music and \"cafe noise\" pleasantly wafting over from the  other side without it being intrusive. 

The left side of the cafe, while not overly noisy, plays host to the caf√©s sound system, the food service counter and several smaller, more social seating areas. See if you can find the tiny cat paw impressions in the brick!

Thus far, I have not been disappointed by either the food or the service here. The strawberry mint smoothies are delicious! The Lattes rich, and the sandwiches simple and savory. The *only* complaint I have about the place is that several hours worth of $5.00 lattes can really add up, but considering the beautiful space and location, I guess the rent has to be paid somehow..."}
{"text":"Yes, okay, so we're all sad that coffeeshops are no longer used for meeting up with friends for a great conversation over lattes, and have rather become the preferred location for collective isolation (re: working). However, this cafe has taken the concept and run with it. 

They have a sunny, gorgeous space that they will rent out for a reasonable rate, for collective meeting. And one of the things that I loved was the many choices of seating. Part of the place is like a library (quiet) and the other part is more for hanging out and chatting. It's very clean looking and bright, which is quite a feat for a half-underground location.

The food and drink is, I would say, the norm. Nothing fancy, but nothing sub-par, and priced appropriately.

I think it will become a regular haunt for me, if for no other reason than the fact that I hate having to sheepishly look around my favorite cafes for an electrical outlet. (Yes, I know, I am unhip, I am a slave to work, a lab rat in grad student clothing, I know...I know...) In this place, it's not a problem."}
{"text":"Right next to the beloved Cafe Aunja.  Totally different environment, and a good one.  My overwhelming impression of this place: excellent service.  

I have been in a few times, once to socialize and once to study.  They always make your drinks immediately (ok, obvious), bring them to you at your seat, are exceedingly attentive, and have terrific attitudes.  You feel like you're being waited on at a nice place. They care if you like their drink recommendations.  The focus is on people who come and stay at the cafe for a long time, which is a business model I don't understand, but hey --- they may be on to something.

The decor is modern, clean, and simple.  Lounging/front room divided by the counter.  Large back room for studying, with several large tables and lots of plugs, and no music playing in this room.  Social/meeting room with tables/chairs.  Another room with large TV/great for watching the World Cup, let's say.

It's nice and unusual to find a place that is doing all of the right things right out of the gate.  It's clean, it's open a lot (till midnight during the week, 10pm on weekends) and the Americano is solid.  In sum: I'll be back."}
{"text":"You want to study? Go here!
Want to have a professional business meeting? Go here!
Want to chill with friends and have a cup of coffee? Again go here!

This place is amazing. You could basically go here for any purpose. It is kinda separated into few places, where you can rent a room for professional meetings, or there's a quiet study area, or if that's not enough, theres also a spacious area to chill. Just grab a cup of good coffee, or some middle eastern food(love the stuffed vine leaves!) and enjoy this cafe! Their staff is very friendly as well, so its perfection."}
{"text":"FYI this place moved to 4000 Jean Talon O. Very cool interior design though."}
{"text":"This morning, a friend and I went to Coffice to collaborate on a project. As a workspace, Coffice is perfect. The furniture is clean cut and the space is wide open. There's perfect lighting everywhere and from what I can see, there are enough power outlets no matter where you are sitting. The brick walls are comforting and there are big chalkboards for brainstorming. 

As the first customers of the day, we scored the massive circular table at the back. It's really nice that the work area is in a separate room to the kitchen and cafe. It was perfect for working together! 

Onto the food: 
Americano - Initially thrown off by the clear mug (see point 3 below) but actually a very good americano with nice caramel and nut flavours 

Coffee - Can't really go wrong 

Bagel with cream cheese - Cream cheese served in a very cute little side bowl 

Squash, potato and carrot soup - Maybe I'm biased because I'm a big fan of squash soups but I really did love this one. Was a perfect duo with the wraps. There were homemade croutons on the side of the soup too - My friend was a fan but I didn't want them. 

Tuna wrap - With olives, tomatoes, egg, onion, mayo. Waitress didn't mention the egg at first so it was a pleasant surprise. I'm not a fan of raw onions but I knew I couldn't get them without because the wraps were pre-made. 

Steak wrap - Looked more peppery than steaky but my friend seemed to enjoy it nonetheless.  

Service: 
Servers are around at a good frequency to ask you for another order or take away dishes. Very good overall. 

Downsides: 
1. Opens at 10 on weekends... Quite a late start considering it is technically also a cafe. 
2. Plays super loud music... I didn't mind too much today but I think there would be times where I would prefer a little more quiet 
3. Weird personal aversion to clear mugs for coffee and tea... My 4-star rating has more to do with points 1 and 2 but I figured I'd mention this point anyway"}
