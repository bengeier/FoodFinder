{"text":"The menu is simple, but contains ingredients for good clean eating. Vegans and vegetarians will find tasty snacks here.  The decor is sparse but I think intentionally this way to accommodate the dogs who are permitted to accompany their owners inside. Plenty of room for them to circulate off leash, there are even private booths for dogs/owners who need more space. Service is friendly & unpretentious.  This place embodies the Plateau style.  A must see if you love dogs."}
{"text":"Un des seuls endroits que je connaisse à Montréal où l'on peut amener son petit toutou à quatre pattes.  L'endroit est bien aménagé, mais il pourrait y avoir des places où les chiens pourraient ce coucher sans être sur le plancher de bois.   Pour ce qui est coté hygiénique, selon mon opinion personnelle, il n'y a rien à dire. Les tables, planchers et la toilette sont tous très propres. Un chien a eu un petit accident de vessie et l'équipe du café a nettoyé avec une serpillière spéciale et un produit pour empêcher l'odeur.   Côté bouffe, je suis déçu. J'ai pris le Mac & Cheese ''vegan'' avec salade. La salade était trop salée et le Mac & Cheese trop poivré. J'ai tout de même bien apprécié le plat dans son ensemble. Les prix sont élevés et ne me semblent pas justifiables pour ce que l'on nous sert. Presque 16,00$ pour mon Mac & Cheese, ce n'est pas donné!   Un endroit que je vais revisiter pour l'ambiance et pour le fait que je peux amener mon petit monsieur poilu. Par contre, je vais m'en tenir à un breuvage et petite collation. _______________________________________________  One of the only places I know in Montreal where you can bring your pup.  The place is well laid out, but there could be places where dogs could rest without being on the wooden floor.  As for the hygiene, in my personal opinion there is nothing to say. The tables, floors and toilet are all very clean. A dog had a small pipi accident and the crew cleaned it with a special mop and a product to prevent the smell.  On the food side, I'm disappointed. I took the vegan Mac & Cheese with salad. The salad was too salty and the Mac & Cheese too peppery. I still enjoyed the dish as a whole. The prices are high and don't seem justifiable for what we serve. Almost $16.00 for my Mac & Cheese, it's not given!  A place I will revisit for the atmosphere and for the fact that I can bring my puppie. On the other hand, I will stick to a beverage and small snack."}
{"text":"What a wonderfully Unique awesome fun place for your dog! My whippet had the best time! The food is lovely, yummy and lovingly prepared. The drinks are very good as well, had an amazing chai latte. I wish we had a place like this in my town, lucky Montreal pooches!!"}
{"text":"Best place to be if you are a dog lover. Smoothies and juices are fantastic! The desserts are outstanding. Pad Thai can be skipped for a perfect experience.   The service is superb as well."}
{"text":"Super endroit pour prendre un café en compagnie de votre chien.  Cependant, n'y allez pas avec l'espoir de jaser longuement avec vos copains, la conversation n'est pas facile avec tous ces chiens qui vous obnubilent. Le café est très bon. J'ai également pris un jus vert pomme-kale-gingembre. Délicieux et moins dispendieux qu'à la panthère verte.   Végétarien, avec options veganes."}
{"text":"Went to this place hoping it would be similar to the \"cat cafes\" in Montreal, in that there would be resident dogs to play with. No such luck, but we went in anyway. Doggy Cafe is a place that allows dog owners to chill with a coffee, while their four legged babies frolic as they please. It's nice and quiet (depending on how vocal the dogs are) and I could see myself going there for an afternoon of reading or studying or watching dogs run around and be silly.   The menu consisted of smoothies, hot drinks (lattes, hot chocolate, etc.), juice and a small meal menu. My chai latte was very good.  The service was friendly, but unobtrusive. After we were served our drinks, we were left alone, which we found kind of nice. Although, when it came to paying our bill, we had to wait around awkwardly for the person who served us to come out from the back."}
{"text":"Although I left my dog in my home country, I've been here twice one time for a doggy birthday and the other casual visit, and it's doggy paradise! The place is small and cozy but have everything your dog would need (except for potty, you need to take the dog out) the staff is really nice and understanding if your dog had an accident. I only tried their cappuccino and it was good. I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Food is literally awful, and you could make better if you put no effort at all. Sad, because staff is really nice and space is cozy and filled with pups!"}
{"text":"Update: 7/2017. Fun having lunch with the princess!!   So much fun to chill with my doggies. Lots of other doggies too. Everyone running around and people just chilling, having coffee, lunch, snacks. Doggy biscuit available for purchase.   My wild berry smoothie was yummy!!"}
{"text":"Woah! Amoureuse des chiens, je suis tombée sur ce café par hasard.  C'est super! J'y suis allée deux fois: quelques jours après l'ouverture, puis la semaine dernière. Déjà, on note beaucoup d'amélioration sur tous les points!  C'est végé, c'est bon (le burger de quinoa est incroyable!), le staff est très sympathique. Le décor est encore à travailler et ça manque un peu de musique, je n'ai pas trouvé l'ambiance très chaleureuse. Mais l'important, c'est ce qu'on mange et nos amis canins, non?"}
{"text":"Great place to grab some coffee and relax. The staff was friendly and even though I did not have a dog with me, it's a wonderful place for dogs to hang out and get all the love and attention they could want from their owners and other guests and dogs."}
{"text":"You can take your K9 inside and order drinks and sandwiches. Delicious! I love the grilled cheese and quinoa burger.  Best part my dog had a great time.  Giving it a 5 star for that as most dining does not allow dogs inside."}
{"text":"What a great place to spend time with your beloved pooch! The environment is clean and smells good, unlike others that I have been to. It has a good selection of healthy food and pleasant service as well."}
{"text":"It was so fun,  the atmosphere was calm and the food is really good.  They do not skip on the cheese in their grill-cheeses."}
{"text":"Great place! The food is honestly some of the best I've had (even though I'm usually not a big fan of vegan food), and the people are SUPER friendly and helpful. When we went there was only one other dog, and my pooch spent the entire time cowering under a table (she gets nervous easily) but the people were extremely understanding!  The service was a little bit slow, but honestly none of us really cared. (There was only one staff member, and she had only been working there for five days). Again, the food was amazing, and definitely worth the wait!   They also have a nice selection of books to read if you get bored.   Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I love Le Doggy Cafe! The staff is wonderful and kind, the vegan/vegetarian menu is great, the smoothies are tasty and best of all, my dog freaking loves it here. I had the quinoa burger and it was delicious and my pup had one of their homemade dog biscuits which he inhaled within 2 seconds. For the amount of dogs that come in and out of here, the place is surprisingly clean, smells good and has a ton of room in which to roam, work and play. The atmosphere really changes depending on the dogs and their owners, but we have always had a blast here and my dog never wants to leave."}
{"text":"Our new favorite weekly tradition: walk over to Le Doggy Cafe and let our pup go bananas with the other dogs. All shapes and sizes playing very nice together. Well-behaved dogs, respectful owners and delicious vegetarian food = heaven. Get the quinoa burger!"}
