{"text":"Best tartare in the city. Trendy little place that's is great for lunch/dinner or appetizers/cocktails. I have tried many things on the menu and they have never disappointed."}
{"text":"L'ambiance est incroyable. J'veux dire... martini, caviar, pas le temps de niaiser. Hehe. Non, sérieusement j'aime vraiment l'ambiance de ce resto: moderne et relax avec une touche pincée au menu (caviar, huître, tapas, plat de dégustation, etc)."}
{"text":"One of my fave restaurants in Montreal. Wish we had one in Toronto...  If you love tartare, then this is the place for you. They offer a number of great \"styles\" for a number of different \"proteins\". Choose your own combination or select one they recommend. Better yet, take the plunge and do a degustation and try five different combinations. Their french fries are great too."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but not worth the bad taste you get from interacting with the staff."}
{"text":"Bad service, rude staff. My boyfriend and I went to have a couple of drinks and appetizers, but we were told we had to order an entree too (if we wanted to have drinks). So they blatantly advertise a cocktail hour, have a bar section, own literally every liquor possible and have an expansive drinks menu, but don't have a liquor license? Erm. Alright, so we ask if we can share an entree between ourselves (we'd eaten before coming), and the waitress abruptly replies \"well that depends on what entree you order.\" Essentially she implied that if we got something expensive to share, she'd look the other way - if not, we'd have to order two entrees. Ick. She gave us \"a minute to think\" (i.e. 20 minutes of no-show). We stood up and left. Oh well - we had some tasty drinks and appetizers elsewhere that night!"}
{"text":"I often go to marche27 and usually the service iis decent and up to par. It was my first time there for 5 a 7 and it was a total disappointment. The waitress didn't allow us to have just some fries with our drinks, she insisted we have an appetizer or entrée even though all we wanted was bite food. We decided to order the edamame considering its the lightest appetizer only to be told it isnt even available, talk about false hope. Finally we got the salad and duck as appetizers and 2 walks 27. Both drinks were soda more than anything, it might as well have been a soda with blueberries, no hint of mint lime nor gin. I was truly heartbroken considering I go to marche 27 almost every week. I don't know it was the waitress (dark hair with a sleeve tattoo) or if it was just an off day at the restaurant needless to say I would never go back had that been my first experience."}
{"text":"Trop cher pour les résultats mais quand même bon. Menu compliquer car il faut choisir un à un les accompagnements. Service à la venant"}
{"text":"Ambiance détendue et agréable, parfait pour des soupers entre amis! Le tartare de saumon style japonais est vraiment excellent, et les différents assaisonnements permettent vraiment de plaire aux gouts de tous!"}
{"text":"Worst service in town. not only slow, forgetting but man how can you be so agressive. I went on sept 4 2015 for lunch. Had ok but slow service until its time to pay and we got a very agressive guy taking our cards. Food is good but this guy (who said has been working there for 3 years) is ruining the place & the experience."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service, though, was terrible. We had a reservation and were seated on time, but then were asked to move to accommodate a large party. I wouldn't have minded, except no compensation was offered and our service went downhill after that. After the large party arrived our server seemed to forget about us; it took ages to get a drink menu and even longer to get a dessert. Then we sat for quite a while waiting for the check, while our server seemed to studiously avoid eye contact in favor of the big table. Feeling ignored for the latter half of our meal put a damper on the whole experience, which is a shame because the food was nice."}
{"text":"I would by no means consider myself a tartare expert, but the beef, French style here was delicious. It came served with some great baguette crutons an we ordered fries for the side as well. My gf had a red pepper soup and loved it, hearty, but not heavy as she described it.   Overall a great lunch stop after walking around st luarant all day. My only complaint is that the tartare portion was actually too big for one person, about half of what was served would have been perfect."}
{"text":"A top location, a great concept and a nice decor, but if you're like me in that you consider that food and service generally trump everything else, by all means stay away. The tartares  are not awful, but they lack oomph and pale in comparison to what's offered in many of Montreal's finest bistros. Ours were served with mediocre lettuce that wasn't accompanied by any dressing. But what got me to write this review is the utterly abysmal service we experienced. Simply put, our waitress did everything wrong. Not only was she generally slow and very unresponsive, she handled two incidents in the worst possible way. The first involved drinks we ordered after she drew our attention go the list of 5$, 50% off cocktails. They arrived more than 10 minutes later, and to this day I still wonder whether there was any alcohol in them... I raised this point after she asked how my cocktail was, and--you will *not* believe this--she responded by saying \"well, don't forget that this is Happy Hour and that these drinks were only 5$!\". No, she was not joking... Second incident, much worst: I found a 6-inch long dark hair in my duck tartare. After pulling it out and showing it to her, she responded--and, here as well, I *swear* that I am not making any of this up...--by saying \"oh, but you know that our chef has very short red hair!\". Can someone please explain to me the relevance of that comment?? I will never go back to that place."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant- trendy and cool. TERRIBLE service. It's such a shame. They have everything else right."}
{"text":"This place is solid, if you like tartar it's a must to go and try. They have a great selection of flavors.  They have great French fries and all sorts of daily specials.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Tres bon resto de tartare.  Je le recomande.  J'ai lu les autres critiques, j'y suis allée 3 fois et les 3 fois le service était excellent!"}
{"text":"I tried the beef tartare in Italian style and I enjoyed it. I also took the extra avocado and salad with my order, but the portion for the extra is very small, I wish they could put a little more for what we paid extra."}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour and had the Ahi Tuna tartare. I was recommended the Japanese spice and it was delicious! I enjoyed it with the edamame appetizer.   The food here is delicious. The ambiance was lovely for a rainy late afternoon. The service was friendly.   Top notch!"}
{"text":"Very good selection on various meat and fish tartars. You can choose your own flavor mix and potion size. Very friendly staff. Fast service."}
{"text":"i've eaten and ordered delivery from here a bunch of different times and was never disappointed. favorite thing on the menu is the basket of shoestring fries. my only issue is that they are very heavy-handed with the salt in their seasoning of the tartare. sometimes it's way too much for my taste, others it's better but still noticeable."}
{"text":"I was there with my sister and my brother-in-law. It's a small place on the corner of clark and prince arthur. There is a lot of different type of tartare to choose from. We decided to get the tartare tasting platter and the fish tartare tasting platter. Each tasting platter come with 5 50g tartare. One platter is good for 2 people to share. It was really good. Love that they have tasting platter, when you can't decide on just one. My favorite was the sesame scallop and spicy deer."}
{"text":"Tasting Platter (Plateau Dégustation) : well worth it but they don't let you customize \"Styles\" (flavors) for the predetermined meat selection.   Don't recommend the ramen. \"Japanese style\" uses linguini for noodles and lacks taste  Very small restaurant causing long wait times, very small quantities, but excellent tartare."}
{"text":"I don't often write Yelp reviews, but after eating here on Friday September 4th 2015 at around 12:30PM, I just had to.  Let's start off by saying the food here was good. Fresh, tasty and kind of imaginative for a lunch spot. The waitress that served us was bubbly, attentive and nice.   Everything broke down when the maitre'd (i'm guessing this is what his role is because he only seated us and then processed payment) came to collect our credit cards for payment.   I was first in my group to pay for my meal and handed over my credit card. When the receipt came out he swore and crumped it up, throwing it on the table. He then gave me the card reader to try again and blamed the error on \"technology\". I happily paid again and this time got the message \"Approved\" on my screen and handed the card reader back to him. He disappeared for a bit and said to me \"We'll process your friends first, then get back to you.\" So I asked him \"Ok, but the transaction was marked as approve, i don't want to pay twice\". He left in a kerfuffle, found the receipt that came out behind the bar and dropped it down on the table next to me saying \"See, you won't have to pay twice mon ami\".   His tone at this point was patronizing, he was clearly losing his patience and having a bad day. So I replied to him \"Thanks, but please don't patronize me\". This degenerated into him insulting me, calling me aggressive, and saying that I was a \"mean person\". This all happened in an extended monologue he gave me, as I sat there silent and confused about how I could have possibly offended this man so deeply.   My colleagues dining with me each paid him and agreed that he was not speaking to anyone with an ounce of respect - he patronized us as hungry children and even said \"So what if I just do my job and don't play nice - all you're going to do is walk back home and bitch about me and then it's over\".   Well mr. shaved head guy, this is what I'm doing. Telling the world about your utter insolence, arrogance and awful attitude. You turned a great, delicious meal into a horrible experience. As a technology executive who frequently brings out my team and my clients for lunch, you can be assured I will no longer recommend this establishment while you remained employed by them.  From seeing the looks the waitresses gave you as you berated us, looks of disappointment, I'm sure this isn't the first time you've acted in such a manner. So people of Montreal - do yourself a favour and stay away from a restaurant that would employ a rude, arrogant host like this. He should not be dealing with customers in any capacity. His skills are better suited at a collections agency or at a casino as a pit boss - any place where complete lack of respect for humanity is a bonus."}
{"text":"Pensez à réserver si vous le pouvez puisque le resto est assez petit et se remplit vite. J'ai commencé ma soirée avec un bloody ceasar tout à fait délicieux. Je n'ai pas pris d'entrée pour pouvoir commander plus de tartares. Nous avons choisi les mix boeuf à l'ancienne, thon thai et canard épicé. Boeuf à l'ancienne a été mon préféré. Super bien assaisonné et frais. Le thon thai manquait de goût. Nous avons dû demander de la sauce piquante pour le relever. Le canard était bien, sans plus. Avec les combinaisons de viandes et d'assainissements, le choix est presque infini et c'est vraiment ce qui distingue ce restaurant. Le service était agréable. Le décor mériterait par contre un petit upgrade pour aller avec les supers bons plats et les très bons cocktails! À essayer pour les amoureux de tartares ;)"}
{"text":"It's a need that I feel often - a few times a week, actually. Five times last week, three of which were satisfied.  You know what I'm talking about - you've felt it before. And no, this time I'm not talking about that need. It's the overwhelming \"I want tartare\" feeling.  Of course, tartare is healthy - it's full of Omega 3 fatty acids that totally fill you up, make your skin smooth and your hair shiny. Most importantly, tartare is beyond delicious. A good tartare is incredibly fresh, combines ingredients that enhance the taste of the fish or meat rather than overwhelm it, and is served with exceptionally thin bread toasts that serve as a perfect perch. There really is no better summer dinner alternative - both you (and your jeans) will feel satisfied, but not overwhelmed.  Some of the best tartars in Montreal (a full \"best of\" list is coming soon) are at Marché 27. Various meats and fish can be paired different vinaigrettes - my favorite is the salmon tartare with Thai dressing made of cilantro, Thai basil, lemongrass oil, lime and shallots. It's so deliciously fresh and soft, and of course, it comes with those delicious thin bread toasts that supply a wonderfully contrasting texture and let the tartare shine. Another good choice (pictured below) is the red tuna with Fresca vinaigrette, made of cucumber, jalapeños, dill, shallots, and lime. Nice and light.  Marché 27 is great on any day of the week. It's small, modern, comfortable and without pretention - a spot in which you can linger or grab a relatively quick bite. When you're on lower St-Laurent, forgo the icky chewy feta of \"Greek\" restaurants on Prince Arthur and the \"Italian food\" at Buona Notte. Get a tartare at Marché 27; class and comfort included.

{"text":"Nous avons adoré notre expérience au marché 27, du début a la fin.  Le resto était vide a mon arrivée vers 5h45, je prend le temps d'observer le décor urbain. murs de céramique blanc et ardoises avec le menu des vins et les spéciaux a la grandeur des murs : J'aime ! Des tables avec des poufs et des chaises. Un bar.   Mon homme me rejoint une quinzaine de minutes après. Nous commandons un drink : ils sont a 5$ pour l'heure du 5 @ 7. Mon martini Walk 27 arrive dans un grand verre a milkshake et il est goûteux et magnifique : une myriade de bleuets flottant dans du soda, le tout agrémenté de menthe et bien sur, de gin. L'homme opte pour un dry martini avec olives, qui dit-il était réussi dans les proportions. (plutôt rare)  Nous commandons une assiette de caviar de saumon sublime  (voir photos) servi avec des petites crêpes de sarrasin en guise de croûtons. Pour la suite des choses, il s'agit de choisir la protéine (poisson, fruit de mer ou viande) et son assaisonnement. Nous prenons 4 choix différents : pétoncle, thon rouge, canard et boeuf. Les 4 étaient absolument délicieux , mais QUE de protéines ! J'ai eu de la difficulté a tout manger. Je recommande donc un seul tartare si vous prenez une entrée, ou bien un plateau a partager qui comporte plusieurs choix mais en portions plus petites.  Tout était bon : le service, le prix et la qualité de l'ensemble. A refaire !!"}
{"text":"Excellent tartar choices ! You have a variety of meats to choose from. I like the originality of having interesting sides ( such as a fried egg on top of your tartar - see my pic). Also, you have plenty of types of breads that come with it. Very very cute presentation as well. If you are a tartar lover definitely go eat here !!"}
{"text":"Oh man, when it comes to tartare, this place cannot be beat!  I must admit that a few years ago, I paid them a visit, and was extremely disappointed. However, I tried again earlier this week and was FLOORED.  The grilled calamari was heavenly, and my tropical salmon tartare transported me to some hawaiian island filled with happiness and deliciousness. Think I'm exaggerating? I'm really not! I also had a Liquid Candy martini which was very sweet but also very good. And the fiance had the beef bavette which was very good as well!  This place made me so happy, that I went back a mere 2 days later for another dinner! This time with the mango and chipotle salmon tartate - YUM. And an assortment of martinis (5a7 = $5 martinis. How can you resist??). The key lime martini wasn't very good. The cinnamon martini was super interesting. The strawberry shortcake martini was basically a daiquiri, and the litchi martini was good - a classic.   If I could, I'd be eating there everyday.. For a large portion of tartare, a side of gherkins, and 4 martinis, the bill came up to $55. Not bad AT ALL for a delicious dinner on a girls night out!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It was simply exceptional.... The decor is very inviting and a great atmosphere. The choice of amazing dishes are phenomenal but what makes the whole experience unforgettable is the service. Genevieve is an awesome host, will take care of you and will make you feel special. Fantastic experience! Can I give a 6 stars? Lol  Ludovic"}
{"text":"Nous cherchions un lieu ouvert relativement tard un lundi soir pour aller souper avant un spectacle, qui lui, demarrait tres tard. Marché 27 était bien situé par rapport a la salle de spectacle et cela nous a donné l'opportunité de le tester. La spécialité c'est les tartares. La plupart des copines du groupe aimaient les tartares mais une personne était vegetarienne et elle a eu un choix plus limité. Sur le menu des tartares de viande ou de poisson et aussi des sauces diverses selon que vous aimez épicé ou pas. Il ya des choix proposés sur le menu mais les plus aventuriers tenteront peut-être de se faire leur propre plat en selectionnant une proteine et une sauce parmis les multiples choix 'bar a tartare'. J'ai choisi du saumon fumé avec une sauce qui me semblait interessante et épicée avec du chipotle. J'ai beaucoup aimé mais la prochaine fois je prendrai plutôt le saumon cru  car le fumé ça rajoute du sel et je suis pas habituée a tant de sel dans un plat. Les copines ont choisi divers assemblages et tout le monde était ravi. J'avais aussi pris des huitres en entrée, intriguée par le mélange proposé. L'ambiance est relax, la musique peut etre un peu forte mais nous etions pres d'une fenetre qui etait grande ouverte sur l'exterieur alors le son se propageait bien quand même. Le bar est attrayant, je me vois bien y retourner pour me poser au comptoire seule et prendre un verre de vin avec un tartare."}
{"text":"I've found heaven in Montreal! A tartar bar. There should be more of those in the states. Must try the duck tartar a la Italian with the quail egg. Out of this world! I also tried the beef a la spicy, lobster tartar a la Japanese and the scallop. All were great but My duck selection was the hit on the table."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm definitely no tartare aficionado, in fact this is the only restaurant I've ever had tarter at (aside from the occasional tuna tartare dish here and there). However, there's no need to try anywhere else because Marché 27 is AMAZING! I've been there two different times now and both times I've ordered the duck (1st time: Italian style, 2nd time: French style). I've promised myself to try a new meat next time but I couldn't resist the duck. It's unbelievable!  The restaurant offers other options aside from tartare, but if you're going there to order something else you're not getting the point. The tartare is where it's at. They have a few options: Tuna, Salmon, Smoked Salmon, Duck, Beef, Lobster (depending on season) and Elk. And then they offer many different styles of ordering it, with different oils and seasonings. The tartares are served with crusty bread for loading up with the meats. What was interesting was one of my companions ordered Salmon, Japanese styled on my most recent outing and instead of the crusty bread they used Taro Chips, which seemed like a quirky and delicious idea!   On both visits I also ordered the soup of the day, the first time it was pea soup and the second time it was carrot-ginger, and these are definitely homemade soups. They were both absolutely delicious! We also ordered some fries this time around and they give you a ton for the price, and a nice little aioli dipping sauce to go along with it.  If you want to try tartare then this is the place to go! I will be back for MANY more visits, as I just can't ignore the cravings I continue to have after each visit."}
{"text":"Beef tartare here is always amazing. Salmon one is a bit less good but would still go for ambiance + other food"}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated with a modern, metropolitan feel, which is perfect for its downtown location. Absolutely loved the atmosphere. Felt a little underdressed in my tourist clothes LOL.  We came here to try out their tartares, and we were not disappointed! You get a selection from 10 different proteins with a choice of 12 different styles. I had the duck with Ancient style dressing and AAA Beef in French style. Both were recommended pairings by the waitress and they were soooo good and well balanced with their texture and flavours! The tartare is ordered by weight, and 100g was about enough for myself. Also served on a lovely board :D. Other proteins I definitely would have loved to try were the scallops and hamachi. For someone who can't make a decision over what to order for her life, this place didn't make it easy! I'd come back here in a heartbeat for the rest of the tartare menu."}
{"text":"Très beau petit resto pour les amateurs de tartares. Formule intéressante ou l'on choisit sa viande et le style du tartare. Les service est très correct et sympathique."}
{"text":"We split 200 grams each of the scallop (Japanese style), beef (Ancient style), and duck (Sunrise style) between 3-4 people and it destroyed us. If you're ordering tartare, you probably don't also need the Tartare Caesar, which comes with a hunky side of tartare of its own.  The three styles we chose were at most very mild. We tried the tartare sampler first, and lots of thought went into the final configuration to make sure the meat would be complimented and not overpowered. I felt pretty good about our decisions.  $5 happy hour cocktails are delightful if you like fruity drinks that are on the sweet side."}
{"text":"First timer and we sat on the mini terrasse because the restaurant was alllll reserved. We got great and quick service and the tartar was really fresh. I had the spicy  one and my sister had the french one and we also got fries. I would def go back"}
{"text":"My wife and I had the foursome platter, it was just the right amount of food for two people. All the food was delicious and we really enjoyed it. The only negative thing to be said was the service wasn't the best, the waiters weren't the most attentive.   I would still recommend the restaurant to anyone looking for something different."}
{"text":"Having tried only two styles of meat tartare before experiencing Marche 27, I was very excited to discover new raw meat sensations. I approve this message. Overall, I can't get the bill out of my head.  Don't get too excited by how the interior looks like: just a decent border between ghetto McGill and le Plateau. Bricks, chalkboards and a pseudo-atmopshere. Oh and an anecdote: the restaurant tries to put in a low lighted, cozy and almost romantic atmosphere at night but somehow needs to have a TV showing Habs getting their butt kicked.   Food was good, no doubt about that. Most of the sauces match well with the served meats and the portions are generous. I recommend the duck tartare and the French fries. More, if the day of your visit allows you to, get some oysters. However, this not grande cuisine. The sauces are sometimes way too sweet and the oyster sauce almost felt like cheap vinegar.   Moreover, I experienced quite a cheesy service with a waitress dressed as if she was going to 1234 and who tried to describe her food as a complex and conceptual experience. Big MTL, keep it simple.  Finally comes the bill. Bleh: Old Montreal prices for simply good food and a decent atmosphere?"}
{"text":"Went here recently last week for the first time because i just LOVE tartare. It's delicious, but its not amazing. There a several selections of styles like French, Japanese etc. that's cool. but when I got the tartare i tasted it (i had red tuna 100g) it was just ok. you can definitely make tartare yourself like tuna/salmon and get the fish from atwater market or La Mer. My only complaint and concern is they don't know where their fish comes from. I am trying to be environmentally conscious and wanted to eat only tuna/salmon that was not overfished but the waitress and kitchen had no idea where their fish came from. That's a bit weird? I would definitely only go again if someone was visiting from out of town or if someone never tried tartare and wanted a hip spot to go to,"}
{"text":"What an unique place, a raw bar that also serves ramen!!!  Of course, I tried their ramen.  Not bad for a non ramen shop.  I need to go back and try out their raw bar.  The menu has a wide range of both meats and fish served raw and chopped with a selection of international condiments."}
{"text":"Delicious but EXPENSIVE!   It is like a freakin robbery going here. My wallet is hurting and my stomach is feeling empty still afterwards.  I guess I am a cheap, hungry girl."}
{"text":"Romantic atmosphere with super friendly service. Parking is a bitch! Bone marrow is proper! Try as many different tartare dishes as possible. The italian flavour is a must try. The plating and presentation was impeccable. This is a must try if you are a fan of tartare with selection from: salmon, hamachi, scallops and much more- ."}
{"text":"Last week was my first time going to the Marche 27 restaurant itself. Previously I'd been to the smaller lunch spot in Phillip's Square. It is soooo worth going to the original! Great ambiance, half price bottles of wine on Thursday and many more choices. My favourite was the veal in the sunrise flavour. The sunrise has a wonderful mix of s"}
{"text":"Totally love this place. They have among the best variety of tartares and the fresness and quality of their products is irreproachable. Luv luv luv."}
{"text":"Had the raw tuna and fries, they were....good.  Love the fries with the skin, nice presentation, cute decor inside (Martha Stewart Hipster ish, and fresh fish.  Not so flavorful, and overpriced.  I'd still go back."}
{"text":"Looking for that gem? Every district has at least one and I think I found it. Located a street parallel of saint Laurent Boul. Marche 27 is kind of hidden out of sight (I know this because I couldn't find it for 10mins...Anyways!)  I would recommend reservation due to the fact it's such a small restaurant but if you go in non-peek hours (before 6pm) you should be okay!  The service was extremely friendly and knowledgeable of what they were serving which in the case you don't know or not sure of what to get, take advantage of them!  Ill be honest and I did some researching before going there to see what the portions were. I found that the bone marrow and beef tartar looked amazing... so I got it! Haha  With the side of 6 oysters... I was in heaven. The beef tartar was just so great... and there was so much more to try but I didn't have the room in my belly. In that case I have to go back right? Trust me I will.     All in all, I would recommend this place for sure. It's a perfect place to bring a date or if you just want to catch up with friends. Location, staff and layout are amazing. I can't wait to come back a feast on more tartar.     Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Terrific location and very nice decor. Unfortunately, the food and service is very much lacking at this price range. It's worth checking out if you're in the area, but don't get your hopes up.  PS - The coffee is fairly good."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. The ambiance, the food, and most importantly the waitresses are always so nice. You can also order it online, which is really convenient when you crave some Russian beef tartar in Montreal winter, and believe me you will."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through alce.ca (a la carte express).  I  had the sampler of tartares, so salmon, duck, veal, beef (a la francaise) and the red tuna.  The salmon and the duck were my favorites.  The duck has truffle oil and great grated cheese on top.  Full of umami I would say?  My next favorite would be the veal.  The red tuna tasted like it had egg mixed in?  Not sure but the texture threw me a bit.  The beef a la Francaise needed a flavor boost.  Also I don't think it's the highest grade in the sampler.  Sampler portions are on the lighter side of 2oz.  Not an impressive value to be sure but it is meat after all.  It's labor intensive to cut all the ingredients up and freshness is a factor.  The sampler was served with a small salad and fries.  The fries were of the softer variety.  To my delight these came with plenty of spicy mayo.    I also ordered the thai shrimp on coconut noodle salad.  Nice sized shrimp.  It's good.  Mostly noodle though.  Next time I will definitely try the seafood sampler."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there (April 30, 2017).  The food was good.  However the service was bad.  We were a group of 5.  We ordered one bottle of wine.  When it came time to have another one, the waitress told us that we took the last one.  This is unacceptable from a restaurant.  She should have told us in advance that they only had one bottle and let us decide to take it or to change to another one.  After waiting for a long time, we had to ask for the dessert menu.  For the price they charge, I will not go back there."}
{"text":"The best tartar meal I ever had! They offer quite a variety of meats and preparation options for each tartar. I recommend asking the waiter for their suggestions if you are stuck in how to pair the options as they were very helpful in suggesting the \"Italian\" style for the duck tartar I wanted. I also got the bone marrow / beef tartare dish, which came with a heaping serving of bone marrow, as well as the Walk 27 cocktail."}
{"text":"Best tartare bar ever, hands down. The menu concept is wonderful, pick your raw meat and then add your flavoring... I chose salmon tropical (AMAZING) and some type of Australian white fish Japanese style (INCREDIBLE).   If you're in Montreal I definitely recommend this place. And hey, if the weather is as nice for you as it was for me, you should sit on their patio!"}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service was deplorable. Not once did the waitress ask us if we wanted another drink once our drinks were empty, she did not come to see us and ask if everything was ok or if we needed anything. As an ex-waitress, this was extremely irritating. When it came time to pay, it took the waitress 15 minutes to get us our cheques and the cook had to come and make us pay cause he was noticing that she was simply avoiding us.   Sadly, because of that, I will probably never go again."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting my family for the holidays from San Francisco and he LOVES his beef tartare, he keeps talking about the magical beef tartare he ate in Quebec City and there was no way I was driving 3 hrs to eat raw meat, so this was the next best thing, what's better than a tartare bar?! We went with my sister and this is tartare galore- my husband was thrilled! I love the atmosphere, trendy and modern and if I still lived in Montreal, I would definitely come here for drinks since all my old hot spots are now invaded by minors, we ordered the seafood and meat tartare tasting platter, 4 people could easily eat this, I also ordered the fries. Everything was excellent! Some were savoury, some were salty, loved the deer and duck tartare best. Yelpers mentioned the high cost but I thought the pricing was pretty reasonable. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"J'adore le tartare et au Marché 27 je suis au paradis. Pourquoi?   1-Parce que je peux sélectionner le type de viande ( du homard au classique saumon) en précisant la quantité de 100, 150 ou 200 grammes et en plus sélectionner ma sauce préférée ( il y a plus un choix de plus d'une dizaine ).  2- L'ambiance est intime, chic avec un joli décor.   3- Le service est impeccable.  4- Les prix sont extrêmement raisonnables.   Ps: Les frites sont excellentes et les calmars aussi."}
{"text":"Heads up, umami bowls on the menu - the salmon bowl I had tasted fresh and amazing. I went for the medium size and it turned out to be too much for me, so evidence suggests the small will suffice for a small person with a large appetite. Our table also shared the confit duck wings which were amazingly delicious. The sangria was not a big hit, too much pop and sweet liquors in that mix for our taste, but the other tables seemed to be full of folks enjoying it.   The size of this place is kind of ideal for me, I can easily believe that all the meals are made with care when there are only ever 40ish people to be fed. And I like seeing the solo regular at the bar with a glass of wine and a pile of tartare reading the paper and chatting with the staff, I like to eat in a place where people feel comfortable to spend time like that. Our waitress was fairly quick and easy going and had no problem switching to English when necessary to answer questions from our American guests. A totally enjoyable experience on a strip of Prince Arthur that is slowly but surely finding itself again."}
{"text":"The variety of tartar was awesome. Came with a party of 4 and had half of the items on the menu. All of the items were very delicious especially the salmon tartar. The server was also very helpful and nice."}
{"text":"The tartars are amazing. Prices are abit expensive for the service you get. We waited 15 min to order and another 15 min to pay. Tables were not stable on the balcony so moved inside, kinda the same issues inside as well. Please fix your wobbly tables!"}
{"text":"I apparently completely forgot I had a bad experience here 2 years ago and made the mistake of coming back. This review is still rated at 2 stars, unfortunately.   I got better service than last time, that's for sure. Nothing exceptional but nothing terrible.   However, it seems the food quality has gone down since my last visit. We ordered 3 tartares and only one had an okay taste. The tartares were chopped lazily so we ended up with what I can only describe as 'mushy' raw fish patty, not tartare. Also, they are sauce-heavy which I find kind of odd in a tartare as it kind of drowns the fish. I can't remember which one it was but one of the sauces had quite an offensive taste. The hamachi tasted odd so that might explain why they were so sauce-heavy.   The wakame was just okay to me but my date couldn't stand it.   The shrimp popcorn was pretty good, but it's not sufficient for me to come back."}
{"text":"I think I'm currently the happiest dude in Montreal. I had the platter with 5 different types of Tartare. Holy mother of Tartare. :)  1) Ahi Tuna, Japanese style: Wasabi, soy tempura, ginger, chives and red onions. Temaki cone.  2) Salmon Tartare, Thai style: coriander, Thai basil, lemongrass oil, and red onion.  Served with prawn crackers.  3) Classic French Beef Tartare: Dijon, tabasco, capers, olive oil and red onions.  4) Duck Tartare, Italian style: Parmesan, truffle oil, onions and chives.  5) Veal Tartare with chilli, tabasco, chipotle, olive oil and red onions.  All served with toasted baguette. :)))  The staff are all very friendly and keep telling each other how much they love each other. In a family way.  I love them too now. :)"}
{"text":"What I like about this place is the service and the vibe.  The waitresses are friendly, without being intrusive and did not treat my English-speaking DCs like pariahs.  Also, there was no attitude when we did not order alcohol.  On our last visit, we had the tartare tasting platter, shared between 3 people (liked that the waitress was able to recommend this one over fish version, implies some knowledge of the menu.)  We enjoyed it immensely, especially the different kinds of breads, crackers and chips.  Beautiful (and unpretentious) presentation and the salmon & tuna were distinctly different.  Other items sampled from previous visits include a salad from the specials board that was fresh and tasty, a fantastic banana creme brulee (I may have hogged a disproportion share... oopsie!) and the hand crafted coffee beverages have always been excellent.  The vibe is chill and other patrons are just having a good time with their friends or relaxing.  It's too bad that they don't serve breakfast/brunch anymore, as that was excellent as well.  4.5 stars"}
{"text":"I'm used to seeing tartare as an appetizer offering, not as the core specialty of a restaurant.  A friend had recommended it to me, and I'm glad that he did.  My son and I jumped into a plate of yellowtail and hamachi with Japanese sauce, and another with duck (yes, it is also raw) with the Italian sauce - both were outstanding.  We also ordered their absolutely amazing edamame, and my son ordered the tuna burger, which was good, but not great.  The service was super friendly and attentive.  It was a bit loud, but the music was great and upbeat, and it was not so loud that we couldn't carry on a conversation.  I think we need one of these in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Tartare all day. Nice little place with a cute decor and lovely service. The tasting platters are absolutely worth it if you want to try a bit of everything. We had the fish and seafood one which was served with 3 different kinds of \"edible utensils\". We also took a duck one on the side as well because tartare is not that filling. Sole complaint about the food is that the French style really only tastes like Dijon.  Probably best to make a reservation as it is a small place that can get quite busy!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in McGill Ghetto neighbourhood. It is a unique tartare restaurant concept, from Salmon, Tuna, Beef, Veal to Scallop and Lobster tartare. You get to choose the weight of the tartare from 100gram to 200 gram and then you get to choose the style from Spicy to Japanese to Russian style.  I thought the concept is very interesting and I love it!  Other than tartare, they have a vast variety of appetisers, main courses which have a Asian fusion approach I mean you can get Grilled Hamachi Collar?!! Oh almost forget they hv a raw bar too, oysters, prawn cocktail u name it.  Now this happen in this little restaurant, I think it's amazing.  Service was great, very friendly, the ambiance was happening and high energy.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Super great - Thursday's are 50% off wine. :)   And the beef in Italian style is to die for.   Great date place"}
{"text":"Yes please to everything on the menu in every permutation.  The focus of this place is their tartar. You can have all kinds of proteins (scallops, veal, duck, beef, shrimp, lobster, tuna, etc) and you can do it in all kinds of styles (itallian, asian, japanese, mexican, etc).  They also have a great selection of oysters and some interesting larger entrees. This is a hidden gem in montreal and i can't wait to go back. Everything was exceptional. Memorable to me though is itallian duck and japanese white tuna.   Much love for this place."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 4 stars (or more!), but I just couldn't...  The food itself was very good. Even though I had high expectations (tartare is not the kind of meal I go to \"cheap and cheerful\" places for) I was very happy with what I got. For $40 the degustation plate had 5 different combinations of meat + preparation style pre-picked. It included 50grams (each) of veal, duck, beef, salmon, and tuna. I also got a side of matchstick fries, which were very good.  The reason why I have to give it just 3 stars is the service. Our waitress basically ignored us the entire night. We never got our water replaced, we were never asked if we wanted another drink, and after waiting to get the bill for about 15mins, we had to flag another waitress down to get it. The venue is very night, and obviously going for a more up-market look/feel, and I would expect the service to match.  I will probably give them another chance. If you go, I hope you have a better experience than I did."}
{"text":"The last time I was here was yeaaarrrrrrs ago, and Im talking probably 7-8? I remember liking the tartar but hated the matchstick fries. So I didn't go back.  Today I went because we wanted to specifically have tartar and I'm glad we did. No matchstick fries in sight   The restaurant is a bit more upbeat than I remember with a lot more ambient and it's great! We took the Asian endive salad, the sweet potato fries and the tasting tartar plate with: Thai salmon, Japanese tuna, spicy veal, French beef and Italian duck (there was even shrimp rice crackers for gluten free) It was yummy! I liked all of them and my favorites were the duck and beef (If you are taking the same thing, eat them in that order as well as the taste gets more intense in that specific order I find)  I definitely recommend Marche 27. Next time I'll probably try the other things they have on the menu, I saw tacos!"}
{"text":"I love to go there for thai salmon and japanese tuna tartare. Fish is fresh and presentation is amazing.  I was disappointed with their wine menu, since they don't offer a lot of choices and also not a lot of private importation."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love it so much that I forget to check-in everything I go there :) Their tartars are one the best in Montreal. The service and ambience are perfect if you want to have an intimate chat with your friends. The music is not loud and you can hear each other. They have a good patio. In addition, they have happy hour cocktails for 5$. :) They also have a very good selection of wines. I would have go there more frequently only if I could afford it that often ;)"}
{"text":"Oh mon dieu, j'aurais pris toutes les combinaisons de tartare au menu! Le tartrare de boeuf à l'ancienne, délicieux . La carte des vins et un peu dispendieuse, mais à deux ça donne un prix raisonnable par personne.   Ne pas aller si on est pressé, faut être relaxe. Le service est bon et courtois, mais on attend un moment pour notre repas, mais ça vaut vachement la peine!   Je recommande fortement, et j'y retournerai c'est garanti."}
{"text":"Me and my best decided to try a new place. We re new to tartare so we asked the waitress for suggestion. It was simply delicious!!!    We wanted to be safe and took tuna and salmon as first choices and decided to try veal. The veal with Italian dressing turned out to be the best.   Waitress was very nice. Gave excellent service!!!  Ambiance is very trendy.   I give this place 10/10, we re definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is great. Location can be a bit tricky. The food descriptions are intriguing. The service is attentive and friendly.   However, don't come here looking for a big plate of food. This restaurant focuses on presentation. You will get a beautiful looking dish that may leave your tummy asking for more. Friends of mine ordered the beet salad. When their dishes arrived, they had less than a typical side dish at other restaurants.  Come here if you want to impress someone with a fancy dinner. But you might want to have a snack first."}
{"text":"J'ai commandé le tartare de veaux italien.Très bons mais pas suffisamment relevé. Avec un ajout de sauce épicé tout était parfait! Le service était lent et la serveuse n'était pas très souriante.. Le brownie était succulent :)"}
{"text":"We ate dinner up at the bar with no reservations on a Saturday night. There was no wait and service was friendly. The sample platter of tartare and a side of fries was just perfect for 2 people (we had veal, beef, duck, salmon, and ahi tuna). The ambiance was intimate and a little bit noisy, but that's what we enjoyed about the restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm late in life in appreciating tartare. However, once I got into it, there are days when you start craving the stuff. Today I had such a day and buddy and I decided to try out the tartares at Marché 27 given that this place and Hachoir consistently seem to have the best reviews for tartare in the city. I went for my usual stand-by, classic beef tartare and depending on how good that went, I'll venture out and try their other tartares in the future. People: it was fabulous. I also ordered a side of bone marrow which was just perfection. I plan on becoming a regular at this tartare bar and try out the different versions. Happy hour also means that cocktails are reasonably priced between 5 to 7 everyday (including weekends) and Melissa the main server is just great. Fun, polite and helpful."}
{"text":"Mes attentes étaient très hautes. J'ai toujours vu le tartare comme étant un plat \"spécial\" qui mérite une attention particulière du chef, donc en sachant que Marché 27 est un resto spécialisé dans les tartares, j'avais bien hâte d'y aller. J'ai fait mes propres choix (pétoncles à la fresca et thon blanc à la thaï) et bien que je les ai aimé, après avoir goûté au plat de dégustation de mon chum, j'aurais dû choisir une viande et un poisson au lieu de deux poissons blancs pour avoir un peu plus de variété. Tous les tartares étaient bons, mais pas nécessairement extraordinaires.  La chose qui m'a le plus déçu était le service. Au départ, on ne m'a pas emmené le bon drink et j'ai été impressionnée par la vitesse pour m'emmener la bonne chose. Par contre, plus la soirée avançait, plus le sourire se faisait rare et l'attente, longue. En demandant un dessert, et même une fois le dessert devant nous, la serveuse partait tellement vite qu'on n'a pas eu le temps de demander un café pour accompagner le délicieux tiramisu. En plus, notre bouteille d'eau était vide depuis longtemps. Pour la facture, il a même fallu qu'on demande à une autre serveuse de nous aide après au moins 20 minutes d'attente, dessert terminé, pas d'eau, pour qu'on vienne nous porter la facture."}
{"text":"We shared a plate with 6 different tartares in different styles that were mostly OK. The duck and tuna were very good. The spicy deer was a disappointment, since the spicy sauce completely overwhelmed the taste of the meat. Could have been chicken for all I know. Some of the other sauces were also a bit too much.   The ambiance is nice and relaxed, but nothing special in that area.  Overall, I think the food is overpriced, as is the beer ($8 for a pint).  In this area full of good restos, it is not hard to find a better meal for less."}
{"text":"They offer a variety of tartares, the beef and salmon are always a classic for me. Each one with its own unique punch."}
{"text":"this place was so much fun nice and dark with loud generic music that made it feel private  cool little bar with a small selection of good cocktails i enjoyed mine the edamame was different messy and delicious the tartare sampler with assorted croutons was out of this world  yummy french fries friendly if laid back service  i can see myself going there a lot"}
{"text":"I really loved this place. Firstly, it's a great concept. The menu essentially revolves around tartare. So you pick your protein, you pick the quantity (100g, 150g, 200g) and then you pick the style. So I picked 150g of Ahi Tuna (red tuna) done in the \"Japanese\" style (soy, horseradish, ginger etc). It was really awesome and came with prawn crackers to eat with.  The fish was fresh and full of flavour - the Japanese style really complimented the tuna.  Other protein options include AAA beef, veal, duck magret, scallop, lobster, hamachi and salmon.   I washed it down with a Hendricks and tonic (with a twist of cucumber) which was $10. It was nice and strong too, and generous on the Hendricks.  I also ordered a side of fries with mayonnaise to supply some carbs and ensure I was full.  In short, I would highly, highly recommend and the owner was awesome - he genuinely wanted to ensure I had a good experience and the service was warm.  Would go back without question."}
