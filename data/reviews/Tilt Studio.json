{"text":"Good selection of games. An ulimated pass for one hour was only $10 and they allow you to play even ticketed games (no tickets dispense)."}
{"text":"If you are a seeker of Japanese arcade racing games, Tilt Studio has a Decent selection. highlights include Initial D Arcade Stage 6 and Wangan Midnight 3DX+. However, the card printer/reader units are broken on both machines, making you unable to save game and vehicle progress (which was a big feature of these games). I would be a regular here even if the card printers worked, but didnt have any cards to sell, it whould at least be less stressful from having to start at square one everytime I start these games."}
{"text":"What a fun time. We went after seeing Tilt for the first time and played a lot of pinball. The food is decent and the fresh made fries are to die for. We took advantage of the drink specials and even tried out karaoke which was nicely done with a light show and everything. Luke the bartender took very good care of our group"}
{"text":"The Best Pinball in the Valley. Very well maintained. Plus beer is reasonably priced, can't go wrong 5 stars"}
{"text":"Just saw the Happy Hour at the Taproom at Tilt Studio Tempe   Better then the $10 drinks at Rain Forest Cafe   3pm to 7pm Mon-Fri $2.50 domestic beer $3.50 mgr choice craft beer $4.50 Jack & Coke  There are appetizers on special to but I forgot which ones"}
{"text":"Great fun. We went to a birthday party today and even the adults got to play and hang in the bar while the kids played games. Everyone had a super time and one of our best ticket hauls with over 2500 tickets won"}
{"text":"As a regular visitor to Game Works which was previously in this location, we were quite sad when they closed down.  After seeing a new place would take over we couldn't wait!!  My husband and I came on a Thursday afternoon with our 3 kids. The place was DEAD!  They had ok games but the air hockey which is our favorite was horrible.  Pucks didn't slide and kept flying off the table.   I was going to get my husband and I a beer but changed my mind once I got the price!!  Holy moly!!  $10 for a beer?!?!  And a whopping $1 off for Happy Hour.  Wow!!  Beers aren't even that much in Scottsdale night clubs! Ridiculous!!    They need to do some serious price adjustments or they'll be gone in no time.  The Mills mall is near a low income area and definitely not going to attract many people willing to pay their prices!!   We will take our business to Dave and Busters where prices are better on games and they have a \"real\" happy hour for their customers.  Even outside happy hour, you won't pay $10 for a beer.  Step it up Tilt Studios before you are forced to shut down."}
{"text":"Such a fun place! Great games and tons of options! We have now gone twice and both times we had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"It was okay. Nothing exciting about it, feel like the games are a little overpriced though. We didn't eat the food so I can't speak to it. You'll see other reviews reference Dave and Busters as a better option, and I would second their opinions."}
{"text":"Saw they were remodeling Gameworks back in April when we saw Jungle Book. I was stoked to see a place with pinball and beer, so when I finally made it back down to AZ Mills this week, hopes were high.  And they were dashed. This place is a let down. They have some pinball, including the super fun Ghostbusters, but aside from half a dozen other cool machines, the rest are old and not very entertaining.   The rest of the games are meh, too. Quite possibly the two worst air hockey tables on the planet. We could not keep the pucks on the table for the life of us on the crappy \"wave\" table nor the flat table. Rest of the games are mostly ticket producers, and a lot of them are carnival style, quite pricey per play, and require at least 2 people to play.  Oh, and quite a few machines were non-functional or messed up somehow.  Specials were good; $10 for a beer and $10 gamecard on a Tuesday is a great deal. Staff was pretty friendly, too.  However, I just don't see any reason to make the trek down here again. Not worth it."}
{"text":"This place rocks! They have a good lineup of pinball! The manager keith is a very nice guy and makes me feel welcome to be there.thanks"}
{"text":"My family and I had a blast here! Loved the pinball selection upstairs. Even my eight year old got into playing pinball! The Metallica, Walking Dead, Ghostbusters and Batman pinball machines were so cool! I enjoyed the beer selection, don't think I paid more than seven bucks for any beer. And they were BIG beers! They also have holders on the sides of the pinball games where you keep your drinks while you play. I thought the staff was very friendly and they were really cool to us the whole time! I'll be talking about my positive experience there on our Aimless Adventures podcast which is on You Tube. Good on ya Tilt Studio! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awful management. Employees mope around like they hate their lives. It's never busy and that's an obvious concern. No one likes to support a business that doesn't care about their customers or the employees of the establishment. It is absolutely a pathetic place to go for a \"good time\". There are far better options and never will be back. Disrespectful management is unacceptable."}
{"text":"MUCH better this time!! After my last review, Nancy, addressed all the issues and invited me back. The place was busy, clean, employees were much happier, and most importantly, the games were all working! Maybe the last visit was just on a bad day? Would return again and recommend Tilt to others in the area."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon while visiting some buds in the area for the weekend. Wasn't super packed. Fair selection of games, though not a ton of the newest stuff that I could see, and not a huge selection of lightgun games, which I tend to go for. Lots of classics and pinball machines upstairs. Classic Skeeball is present. Some other types of games for the rest of the family that I don't generally try (Deal or no deal, spin the wheel type stuff). There's a restaurant, though I didn't check it out since I'd already eaten.  A couple games were unusable and waiting for repair. It was my first time there so not sure how long games go for like that.  I did have a need to play some of the claw/UFO Catcher games (ya gotta win the prize for the girl sometimes). One in particular I found I had a bit of luck with so I kept at it. After a couple of games, however, the claw started wigging out and basically stopped working. After three or four games I gave up and went to ask if they could just comp me the games. They had me go back and wait for someone that would verify the game wasn't working right and then coin me on another game. Fair enough, I supposed, though I was wary they were just going to say nope it's working tough luck guy.   Turns out the technicians were not only able to verify the problem but also helped repair the claw game enough to get the last two or three toys to complete the set I had been trying for. Though they might get lots of people trying to con a few free games, they never once showed that that was what they expected. Great, solid customer service and far and away better than I expected.   There are loads of eating and entertainment options in the world. The ones that set themselves apart are the ones with a friendly and welcoming staff when it comes to questions and problems. Basically--solid customer service. TiltStudio figured it out. I would recommend them if you want to spend a couple hours on a hot day playing some games. Just be sure to leave at least 30 minutes before the mall closes. Traffic getting out was slow going."}
{"text":"Man best prizes super badass!!! My bro and i went and the games are a bit expensive but damn the prizes are awsome!! And me and my hubby wanna come with out daughter really chill atmosphere !!! Yall hope you enjoy it"}
{"text":"Ricardo the manager is rude and there Google place is misleading. When you google tilt studio tempe Google says they close at 11. We buy two unlimited cards go eat pizza at there facility, then the microphone says they close in 10 minutes (10pm). I inform Ricardo that there google page says they close at 11 and he was just rude. Instead of apologizing or saying they will fix it he acts likes its my fault and gives me a attitude and says how I should have went to there website for the correct hours."}
{"text":"I am giving this place one star because ZERO is not an option this has to be the worst family event location. They harassed me and my children and the manager Meghann Mcbryan was using foul language around my children and then they had the nerve to kick me out for ordering pizza from somewhere else and I only did that because their food options were Terrible. I expect to hear from someone at this business because we spent good money here for some woman to insult me."}
{"text":"This is a very hip and fun gaming arcade! Very fun located inside the mill mall. They are pricey for the games though and my kid will go through his card very quickly. They are kind of on the low end with earning tickets on the games.   Their Taco Tuesday is amazing though! Deliciously authentic street tacos!"}
{"text":"Policies on \"photographers\" are nowhere to be found.  If you're going to enforce policies please make they are available so your guests can be aware.  Also, no one in our group was a \"photographer\" we just have a camera that isn't a cell phone.  Thanks for the response but it just gives me another reason to never step foot in there again.  Will definitely not recommend this place and will deter friends and family."}
{"text":"I threw my son a birthday party here and we were both excited, but our experience has left us not wanting to come back. These are all the reasons why:  - I had to continue to ask for refills on the drinks that were supposed to be unlimited. - The soda was flat - We were only checked on the first 45 minutes when our time was reserved for 3 hours. - They did not have a lighter for the cake. - I had to ask for a knife for a cake because they did not bring one out with the cake after I had to look for them to bring out the cake that I took in. - There was a girl with dark hair that does not know how to smile and was very rude to my guests - There is only one restroom and it is on the first floor (we were on the second) and it was very filthy.  I would not book another birthday party here and I would not come back here for an outing either."}
{"text":"Parents: you can use the unlimited game card on ticket machines (you just don't get tickets) so it's great for skee ball for the toddlers."}
{"text":"One of the only places who has The Adams Family Pinball game. The $20 for $30  card you buy is worth it."}
{"text":"So we thought this sounded like a good idea after looking up multiple arcade style places and boy were we surprised! We came for the \"Studio Family\" package for 29.95 for my daughters 8th Birthday. First of all, upon swiping my debit card, literally as soon as I swiped it the guy at the cash register tells me \" by the way these cards are only good for the games with green and blue lights on them, these will not work with none of the prize winning games\", I thought ok, there must be a decent amount of games we can still play.. No, the only games we could play for an hour were pinball and some other really old games while being surrounded by awesome fun looking games. So we desperately tried to have fun still, then went back after an hour (while trying to convince my daughter that we're having fun) to eat pizza which is included in the deal and it was admittedly burnt and they did give us a 2nd pizza for free (which was nice) but then I went to get our cups and there was absolutely no soda (actually there was Diet Coke and diet dr. Pepper). There was all kinds of gnats swarming the soda machine too. I felt completely ripped off, my daughter was bummed out on her bday so needless to say I got a full refund which was handled properly but I will NEVER go to this place again and I would NOT recommend anyone waste their time and money here either. Be warned, this place SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"I am so so soo glad this place is here now! I have not been to game works since last year and I'm honestly glad this one took its place. I thought it was too dark and I'm glad they painted so you can actually see in here. Me and my mom came for lunch and to play some games and we're not disappointed! We both got giant delicious hot dogs and the best onion rings I've ever had. We were also able to watch some football while we ate so that was nice too. The bar area is cute and they serve four peaks beer which is a plus. I also really like all the retro games they have upstairs too ! I know the old location here started phasing out all their old stuff. I will probably end up coming back here with my boyfriend or possibly a birthday party :)"}
{"text":"The service was so poor, that I am convinced that any of these positive reviews have been bribed. The management does not care about the well being of their guests and lacks a general understanding of customer service. After checking out their website, I thought it would be a cool place to go grab a drink with some friends and take some pictures with all of the bright lights as a backdrop. Turns out that's against the rules that are not posted anywhere. It did not end there though; the owner or manager of this place also has been harassing my friend over and over who posted the photos we took on her social media demanding they be taken down. This is absolutely unacceptable for any professional establishment, especially one that is part of a franchise."}
{"text":"5 stars for entertainment! We came for a birthday party last weekend and were  Impressed by the whole set up we had to come back today and check it out again. There is a daily special going on that you need to check out before you go . Today was get a $30 player card for $20. This was a good deal, but for 3 kids it's not a cheap summer activity! Just bear that in mind when heading down there. The $30 card lasted each kid around an hour. I would love to come back to try some food or maybe book a birthday party . The place was very clean and all games were working . Definitely a fun place to check out"}
{"text":"The food is decent but very expensive. We got the loaded fries and the sour cream was just a large, hard glob that was difficult to eat. There was nothing light on the whole menu except for unappetizing salads. Slow, unreliable wifi. The service was slow and unfriendly, especially because the place was basically deserted. The bathroom was awful too. There was trash all over the floor, in all of the stalls. Many stalls had no toilet paper. It smelled disgusting and the toilets wouldn't flush."}
{"text":"Looked cool, but waited 5 minutes for someone to take our money.  Nobody ever came.  Then went to prize counter and nobody was there either.  Just got to Dave and Busters....score!   Half price games.  Thanks Tilt!!!"}
{"text":"I loved the $10 Tilt card deal that we did, for an hour you can play anything except claw games and ticket games for $10. My husband is a huge pinball nerd to it was worth it. Now we came on a Monday in the daytime, and it wasn't busy it was nice. There was one major problem though. We went The ladies room, and there are 12 stalls, 1 was out of order no big deal...the first stall I picked, no toilet paper, the second stall I picked no toilet paper, third stall I picked NO Toilet paper! What the heck! I found a stall eventually with toilet paper, while I was in the stall my girls looked further for their own stalls and it turned out that only 2 of 12 stalls had toilet paper. It's really not a very good sign that they are properly checking on the bathrooms, and if they are checking then maybe the person that is responsible for the ordering should probably be aware that there is almost no toilet paper in the ladies room."}
{"text":"this is, hands down, the best public spot for pinball in the greater phoenix area. machines are pristine, great selection, and its separated from most of the 'family' games so its laid out right. they run various deals so you can figure out the best way to work it for you. i don't know about the food or drinks, so take this review for what it is: a thumbs up from a pinball nerd"}
{"text":"Terrible employees. Over priced games. They will kick you out if you don't have a game card (even if you're just checking out what games they have). I will never recommend this place nor come back."}
{"text":"Not only do they have one of the greatest selections of pinballs, they're constantly rotating games so it's always fun to stop in here. The bartenders and servers are exceptionally nice and make it a point to remember you, even if you've only been there a few times.  They're super awesome about maintenance on the machines and the whole arcade is always clean, bright and fun. The Tuesday pinball league is something else I highly recommend. I've made a lot of great friends through that league.   Plus, the food is really good! Seriously, get the tater tots with their spicy aioli dipping sauce. And happy hour prices during the week can't be beat."}
{"text":"I'm wish I could give 0 stars. We planned a small birthday dinner for my son with family and a friend. I called to make sure we could store our custom cake while the kids played and no one knew, the manager finally told me they don't allow it and we could go eat our cake in the food court but not in the arcade. I called the corporate office to see if they could override this. We fully intended to spend quite a bit of money on games and food, but this was a custom zombie cake. The senior vp called me and came off quite rude. He told me they do not allow cake OR presents on our own because they are very proud of their party package and wouldn't want others to see what we are doing and think that was all they got for a party. But if I paid for 6 extra children that would not be attending I could bring my cake and presents. At this point I was in tears because I wasn't expecting to not be able to give my son his presents at the venue. They can have whatever policies they like and I should've asked specifically about the cake when we checked out this venue 2 weeks ago but it's ridiculous. I called dave and busters to ask about the policy the man who answered the phone very cheerfully said \"absolutely!!! as long as you bring the manager a piece!\" This review was on the customer service not the arcade. We were actually pretty excited to go there. It looked cooler than game works when I was a kid. We will never set foot in this place.I guess dave and busters does better on business so they don't have to strap you down to a package to allow you to pass out presents.  RE: in reply to Nancy from tilt studios . We were not in need of a full birthday package. As I stated we were a small party. I had 4 children and would've been required to pay for 10 in a package. I'm sure you were ready to SELL $$$ (put together) me a birthday package as I was desperate to make sure my son would have his cake and presents for his birthday. Your business is entitled to whatever policies you'd like however ridiculous they may be so, I just won't go there and I'll share my experience with others. Your business is the ONLY place I've ever heard of where I couldn't pass out presents because I hadn't paid for a party package. I have 3 children who I love to spoil on their birthdays and we won't ever be spending our time or money there because of the CUSTOMER SERVICE. We are having a great time at Dave and Buster's though!!!"}
{"text":"Ricardo is the most unprofessional manager I've ever seen. Worst customer experience ever! When I brought my problem to him he was very rude to me infront of my family. I will be contacting corporate at this point."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good - especially the chicken tenders. They're like KFC chicken and HUGE, probably the best chicken \"tenders\" (more like full on chicken breasts). Good deal for your money if you do the $15 deal for the meal that comes with a $10 game card.  The problem is, other than some old arcade games and pinball machines, most of the games are expensive ticket spitters. Additionally, there were a lot of kids there unsupervised. I get that there are obviously going to be kids and have no problem with that, but when a five year old runs up and hits buttons on the game I'm playing and messes it up, and I kindly ask him to stop because we're playing, and he doesn't, that's not okay. There was a kid who ran up and asked if he could play the game I'd just paid for, he didn't have any credits. I had probably 5 or so kids mess with my games or try to take over a game I was playing. I get that it's not the responsibility of Tilt but it definitely ruined the experience. Sticking to Dave and Buster's."}
{"text":"Happy there's still a Gamespot inside the mall but it was pretty lackluster but I can say that one of the bartenders she was amazing so the next time I want to have drinks and watch a movie I'll probably go back."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was disappointed by my first experience at Tilt Studio. I had purchased a Groupon for unlimited game play and a $5 ticket-game card. When my boyfriend and I entered the building, we found it very unclear as to where to redeem the Groupon. There was an empty desk with a computer by the door with no one behind it. One of the men working saw us cluelessly standing there and didn't greet us or ask us if we needed assistance. Instead he just ignored our presence until we asked him where to go. We were then directed to the ticket redemption area. All of the staff seemed sluggish and inattentive about 20 minutes after opening. We told the staff about our Groupon and we could not even hear the female staff member when she was talking to us. She didn't make an effort to raise her voice so that we could hear her over the loud arcade noises, and we ended up being confused even after our interaction with her. We then went to play the games and noticed that some of the video games lacked vibrations on one of the two players sides, some screens were black even though the music was playing and other lights were on, and the whole place felt like a sauna. Then, my boyfriend and I accidentally used our $5 card on the unlimited video game play (100% our mistake, not Tilt Studio's) but when we went up to the desk to ask for it to be reset, the same female employee told us we needed to tell her all of the games we used it on. This was difficult to remember since a couple of the games didn't even work that we used it on. The manager then came over to approve the reset on our card, and when he scanned the card, we could see all of the games show up on the screen that we used the card on. There was seemingly no reason for my boyfriend and I to struggle to try to remember the games if they were listed right there in front of her. The staff seriously lacked basic customer service skills. As we played games upstairs, I noticed more and more how hot the room was. It seemed as though there was no air flow in the whole arcade and my boyfriend and I were left sweating and struggling to cool down. I was so disappointed by what I expected to be a more fluid and easy-going experience. Sufficed to say that I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I come here for the selection of pinball machines.   One of the largest in the PHX area and very well maintained.   The selection is so good that there is a pinball league that meets here every week.  Famous for: Large selection of old and modern pinball machines."}
{"text":"This place could really be amazing!!  The staff is friendly and fun, the new layout is welcoming, and the food was decent. Happy hour does not compare to HH at Gameworks. The owners really need to give their staff the tools for success. The bartenders are having to run between bars to share bottles, they could not locate plates, seriously plates, pizza doesn't come with cheese, seriously no cheese, and also the manager had to get out her own wallet to give change for my $100 bill - it was only $50 in change. The staff is also seemed terrified of the owner - every time he came around they would just get nervous when they weren't doing anything wrong.   Here are my 2 cents - add cheese to your pizza, give your registers at least a $250 bank, buy some plates, and be nice to your staff.  I asked if they get perks for playing the games, etc. the staff said no. I bet it would be amazing to implement a $10 game credit to their paycheck or a monthly play bonus."}
{"text":"The bat in the 2nd floor got closed. They moved it to this small dining area. Not a cool place to hangout here anymore. I'm taking my hard earned money and friends somewhere else. Not coming back until the bat area is open again. It's uncomfortable that you can't sit infront of the bartender, no small talks. I have to get up and walk up to get a drink or wait on my ass until someone comes by. So annoying."}
