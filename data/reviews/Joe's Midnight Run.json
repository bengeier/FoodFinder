{"text":"My wife and I moved into the neighborhood a couple months ago and heard great things about this place so we went to check it out.  It has quickly become my favorite spot in Uptown.  Great menu, service, and let's not forget that you can purchase great wine late at night!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Check this place out if you're in the area. I'm pretty sure you can't get a 40 oz of malt liquor at any other restaurant. Totally cool atmosphere and concept, great food, and they have a good craft beer selection if you aren't feeling like a 40 of Cobra. I had the curried cauliflower as an appetizer, they were so great, I try to replicate it at home now."}
{"text":"I stumble on this place based on the many stars review on Yelp. I grew up listening to the hip hop era and was told on many Yelp reviewers that this was a hip hop vibe place. I was stoked when I read that. My boyfriend and I decided to drop by on a Thursday night to avoid the hectic weekend crowd. The place was decorated and we decided to dine outside their patio. Hip hop music was very faint in the background and decor was ok for the theme. Now, I must be honest cause I don't like giving a bad review.. Im not a big eater at all but just a typical average eater who believe in eating everything in moderation. My reviews is based on quality/taste of the food and not so much in portion. I usually don't care if I go home hungry but if the food was superb-I would give the place a 5 stars. But if the food is not good, I would give it a low rating and that is what happening here. We ordered wings for appetizer, a flat iron steak, a full size Caesar salad with shrimp, and a duck entree cook in mole sauce.   The wings were so tiny and small. Plus they were so overcooked that it was so dry. The flat iron steak was good. The Caesar salad had no flavor- at one point I thought they must forgot to toss it with dressing. My duck cook in mole sauce taste ok- what really disappoint me the most was the entree was kinda pricy and all I got was the drumstick part of the duck. It was so small and I barely can get 3-4 good bite out of the duck drum. So we came home not full and not satisfying."}
{"text":"The food was good. Roasted veggies and entrana. Wait staff was pretentious and corrected me on how to pronounce entrana. Very rude and inattentive."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! I can't stop telling my friends about this place! Food delish, diverse crowd, HIP! HOP! I love the layout of being able to see the chefs in action, the bar poppin, and people chillin in the patio. I ordered the fish tacos! BOMB! Fresh and filling. Can't wait to go with friends!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and for restaurant week and was so happy with our choice. The deal itself was great...3 courses plus 2 drinks for $33...yes please! We all ordered different things to try and the grilled octopus was surprisingly delicious. The infamous notorious big burger was bomb. Our apps came out somewhat timely...the grilled romaine was probably our fave even though simple. The 80s 90s ambience tops it off! The good music could be a bit louder though"}
{"text":"Love this place for the food! We have eaten here several times and always enjoyed our meals and the varied menu. Patio, inside table or bar area all are comfortable and the decor pleasant, light. Service has always been pleasant and the prices reasonable. Music may be a bit loud, but that's the way they bill themselves so no surprise. Happy to have Joe's in the hood."}
{"text":"What to say about Joes...it's a toss up. I really liked this place. It was a great spot to hit up after a long 14hr day in the kitchen, after all they are open till 2 and really understand the struggle.  My friend and I got sat right away. The patio doors were wide open and it was a current 54 degrees...chilly lol. After we confirmed we weren't drinking with our server because we have an early morning he forgot about us for a good 15 minutes. The lady behind the bar (tall brunette) noticed and got over to us right wAy and took our order. She was fabulous. After another 25 minutes our apps came. The cauliflower totally under cooked. And then our server showed up again lol and was shocked because he couldn't remember what we ordered...well sir that's because you didn't take it lol.   Then our entrees came out with out the table cleared from our apps. Small table so it got kinnnnnnnda crowded. I got the grilled romain with chicken. This is the second time being here with under cooked chicken... not lol. The blonde lady who came by asked us how everything was, I wasn't going to say anything but my friend convinced me because we are in the industry and should help a brotha out. She was super nice and got it going and then had the manager come over and address it. It then took another 25 minutes...to not receive my salad. The manager knew all this and he wouldn't come talk to me. When I approached him because I have been there for an hour and forty minutes total, not having cocktails, haven't even gotten my salad, he barked at me that he was takin it off the bill. So we still paid $33 for a meal that was totally ruined by the experience. Super disappointed and over Joes."}
{"text":"Went with family. Food was EXCELLENT. Flat Iron Steak was perfect. I have been cooking with charcoal grills for decades and I know how hard it is to cook a PERFECT STEAK in a wood grill. I loved the bone marrow appetizer. I recommend the wine Colome, from Argentina, Malbec. It was a great complement for the steak. We ordered dessert to share and the caramelized bananas were GREAT. The apple tatin was to DYE FOR. Overall a wonderful evening. The staff was friendly and willing to accommodate your requests promptly. They gave us fresh silverware a couple of times. That is something you don't see often. Price wise was very reasonable so we left very happy. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!!!!. And they are open till 02:00 am. Full kitchen open till 02:00 am. I plan to go back real soon. Probably for their Sunday Brunch. I already heard it is also EXCELLENT. I rate it 5 stars all the way around."}
{"text":"Awesome Food ***** Great Service, super attentive and full of charm right from the start!We were a larger group and they had the common sense to move another table to accommodate us, that kind of common sense doesn't happen often, We ordered the Milanese sandwich which was incredible, the burger is a MUST TRY, Ahi Tuna sandwich melted in your mouth, and the cauliflower appetizer was perfect. Apple tart for dessert has to be had! Owner was present and on top of everything! Already told friends about it and hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"The starter took 20 minutes to arrive and our main plates were luke warm/ getting cold. I will not be back nor suggest this establishment to friends. if you are dining in the 7th ST. area try Mora or Casa Anejo or Camp Social. I have eaten at all three places and had better food and better service. If you're looking for a real cocktail or a actual selection of spirits try the Womack on 7th, great spot"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, nice vibe, creative menu.   We loved hearing the 90's hip hop playing while walking down memory lane and the service was GREAT!"}
{"text":"Hip spot with great drinks and great service. The curry chicken sandwich is my favorite thing plus they're super dog friendly"}
{"text":"Amazing jerk chicken and waffles with pineapple! Great drink selection and they have a dog menu! Friendly service and comfortable patio with fans and misters. Even on a 100 degree plus day it was very comfy."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. The bone marrow was awesome and the fennel salad on the side is a great refresher in between bites. Also got the pulpo, the octopus and it almost melts in your mouth. Tasty, good price, and you can't beat happy hour after 11pm. $2 off everything. The 90's hip hop kept me there for another drink. Great little place and if I'm ever back in Phoenix, I'll be sure to visit."}
{"text":"Well that was disappointing. I live right near Joe's and have been anxiously waiting for them to open for weeks. Imagine my joy when they finally finished construction and opened the doors! My hope was that it would be a nice little watering hole with burgers and sandwiches. The kind of place you could kill a saturday afternooon on the patio hanging out, drinking, and eating good ole' artery clogging American bar food before stumbling home in a pleasant buzzed state.    Sadly, after our initial visit, I'm not even sure what this place is. Is it a neighborhood hangout  or is it an upscale \"ristorante\" catering to foodies from the Central Corridor? Either way it fails on both counts.   The staff tried to make it enjoyable but they didn't try that hard. The greeter was a 20-something dude who looked thrilled to be there. Thrilled the way you're thrilled when the doctor tells you that he wants you to have a colonoscopy. Maybe next time he can try to smile when customers walk in the door. Just once. Turn that disengaged look of polite disinterest into a big grin and welcome people with open arms as they walk into your brand new establishment!   The waiters couldn't keep up and apparently don't understand that you should bring all the food to a table at once. You don't bring one person their plate, and then 3 minutes later you bring the next person one of their items, and then maybe three minutes later you bring the last item.  Unfortunately, the menu leaves much to be desired. Bone marrow anyone?  Foie gras? Sweetbreads (calf pancreas)? Ummm.......how bout'....no.   Don't even think about bringing a kid here. There is nothing, and I mean nothing, on the entire menu that a kid might like or even remotely consider eating. So unless you want to watch the confused expression on little Muffy and Bif's faces as they slowly work their way through the menu before concluding that they're going home hungry just leave the kids with a sitter.  The food itself: Adequate at best, dull and flavorless, portions too small for the price, not enough toppings. I would suggest the chef who came up with the menu and recipes take some continuing education classes on flavor and taste because they really don't seem to grasp the details of their chosen avocation.  On the plus side drink prices are reasonable and unlike many of the other local bars happy hour actually runs until 6 PM. The menu said everything is $2 off during happy hour so that means pints should only be $3. The beer selection is pretty darn good.   Finally, he brought the check in a Garbage Pail Kids childrens book. Yeah, that's cute, but it still doesn't make up for sub-par food and a marginally pleasant experience.   My suggestion is eat somewhere else, anywhere else really (McDonalds, Tuliobertos, I think you get my point), and then go to Joe's for a couple cocktails."}
{"text":"if you come to Joe's do not park in front of of the flower shop or Otro cafe.  The owners are complicit in letting Maverick tow company illegally tow your vehicle.  The signs are not up to code.  They take your car to this location in Glendale.  They then extort $185 to release your vehicle which is illegal and above the allowed towing charges.  Today when many of us went to Maverick Tow, which is unmarked and surrounded with barbed wire, the police were called in order to release our vehicles.  Please be smart and do not be a patron of this center until they change their practices."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best burger in town. I crave their burger with the pulled pork and cole slaw. The curry Ketchup is amazing. Everything at Joe's is delicious  and I love that they are open late with great food, not average bar food."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't try this place sooner! The beer and wine menu are great, especially the local selection. The small bites are fun and adventurous but the real treat came when the GM, Ryan, brought us fried brussel sprouts leaves from the kitchen. It was a great time after a long week! And they hooked it up with an industry discount without me even asking! May have been the all black everything look I was sporting straight from work :) I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the other night with my neighbor on our nightly walk.  Was very impressed with decor inside.  A bit noisy to talk, but great appetizers and drinks!  We had two wines and a plate of frites.  Nicely crisp potatoes with three different dipping sauces - a curry ketchup, a garlic aoili and chimichuri, very tasty.  We had eaten dinner before our walk so didn't sample the food but the menu is very interesting with lots of good choices.  Our barmate sampled the scallops which he  felt were outstanding!  They were nice and big and looked juicy.   Great choice of wine, beer and cocktails!  Their happy hour is $2 off everything, including cocktails!  Check it out! We are definitely going back for more!   OPEN TILL 2 AM!    SHOUT OUT TO BRONSON the Bartender!  Very attentive!"}
{"text":"So, I think our waiter was hard of hearing. We called out to him multiple times to get more of the wonderful curry ketchup, but had to finish frittes before they got cold. The atmosphere is great! I love ahi tuna whenever I order it, but if I'm expecting grilled fish tacos I wouldn't expect ahi tuna seared on one side. Very disappointed in the nonchalant  mannerisms of waiter.  This was my second attempt to try to find something great on their menu. Just disappointed!"}
{"text":"I always drive by this place & finally stopped in. I have no idea why I haven't been in sooner but it won't be the last. We started off with the flatbread which happened to be basil, tomato & asparagus. I was hesitant with asparagus on flatbread but it was AMAZING. The crust was so flavorful too. I had the pork chop for dinner which left me almost in tears. My friend had the burger which was massive in proportion. Randy was our waiter and provided a phenomenal experience. Love love this place! Will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way home from a concert in downtown Phoenix. The trendy but casual vibe made us feel at home as we indulged on some midnight snacks. The fries and sauce trio were bomb. The Curried cauliflower was a bit over salted for my taste but still kept me coming back for more. Grilled wings finished with a grilled artichoke were my favorites. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here late one night and we ate out in the patio. The dinner and desert was very good. We had a hard time figuring out what to order. I did the flatbread and mushrooms and my friend had a pork chop, which was huge. In the end we split a tart desert that I could have eaten several times, it was that good.  Service was a little slow. I did notice the table next to us received their food before we did, despite the couple arriving after we did. But the waitress was nice and definitely did her best. I think a little more experience will improve her efficiency.   Looking forward to coming back here again."}
{"text":"I'm in town from Dallas and stumbled on this place on yelp. Now I don't want to go home! The music is perfect, awesome beer selection and wine on tap, fire pit outside, excellent service and the food is on point! I've already decided to come every single night while in town."}
{"text":"I visited Joe's this afternoon on the recommendation of two friends.  I'm very glad I did.  I had the Notorious B.I.G Burger entree and the Tart Tatin for dessert.  Both were superb.  I cannot emphasize enough how delicious the food was.  The variety and distinctiveness of the flavors in the burger caught me by surprise from the very first bite.  Likewise, the dessert had a rich, decadent quality with several distinctive flavors.  Any apprehension I might have had about the prices disappeared as soon as I began eating.  This was definitely worth it.  My server, Chris, was knowledgeable and attentive.  Everyone, from the hostess, the busser, and even the general manager, were all very courteous and welcoming.  The atmosphere of the place, from the décor, the choice of music, and even the TV in the back playing movies like \"Ferris Beuller's Day Off\" and \"Back to the Future,\" was perfect.  They have booths with skylighting, tables and chairs, bar seating - it's impressive how well they've utilized the space inside this building.  I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant in every regard, but the food alone would make it worth a try."}
{"text":"Love this place! GREAT food, drinks, and even better service. They treat everyone like friends and family. The staff is amazing, Ryan the manager is so personable and a true foody!"}
{"text":"I actually wanted to give a 3.5 star but since I am technically challenged I couldn't figure out how to do a \"half\" star.  This is my second time to try this place and while I really like the atmosphere I have to say the food is slightly better than ok.  I went with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday dinner and our waiter was great!  We had awesome conversation, great ambience and certainly the food is good; its just nothing to rave about.  I personally ordered the tuna sandwich because that is what I had the first time I went here and it was THE best tuna sandwich ever.  The first time it was chopped up ahi tuna and then pressed together like a hamburger patty with other ingredients.  It was served rare like sushi and was one of the most delicious tastes you could imagine.  This time I ordered it again, thinking I was going to get the same thing but when it came out it was SLICED ahi tuna on a bun.  Still good, but not NEARLY as unconventional or tasty as the first one.  When I asked the waiter about it, he said the chef decided to change it (no doubt the preparation for the previous way was way too entailed than just slicing up some tuna and placing it between two buns).    The sandwich is $14 and comes with French fries or you can substitute a side salad for $1.00 more which I did.  Another friend ordered the hamburger (bunless) and got the side salad too.  It is served with a lemon aioli dressing already on it but we had to ask for more because it was almost tasteless.  Several other in our group ordered the pork chop and it was nicely prepared (except for one) and another person ordered the lamb chop.  Overall the place is fine for a casual dining experience if you don't have high expectations.  Considering all of the options available in the 7th St. corridor now, this place should be trying to do everything it can to keep its customers coming back.  I would go again but its not going to be one of my regular \"go to\" places in central Phx."}
{"text":"Tried Joe's for the first time and was in love with their quirky décor! A true 80's/90's hip-hop theme ran throughout the place from the music playing to the Beastie Boys quote on the wall and themed menu items.  The menu boasts a number of dishes from many different countries. The biggest downside was the number of options on menu and the item descriptions. We had to ask the server to explain many of the ingredients and some of the items had ingredients in them which were missing on the menu.  I ordered the Caciocavallo Cheese which was a crostini with cheese and mushroom ragu on top. The portion was decently sized and was really good if you like mushroom. We also ordered a plate of Frittes (fries) which came with three different dipping sauces. I would definitely recommend ordering a plate because the sauces were so good and full of flavor!   All around a good experience!"}
{"text":"Great addition to N. Central. Scallops and steak were great. The notorious burger was amazing. Great atmosphere. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great food! Great menu! The music selection was excellent and the service was too notch! Our waiter (Christopher) was outstanding. He explains the menu items to a point where one can hardly resist ordering everything. I have already, and will continue recommending this restaurant to friends."}
{"text":"This place is awesome Rick the owner is very respectful and treats people very well. The food is delicious!!! The best thing is the Vibe and the sense of feeling like you walked in to your Nana's  kitchen!!! This place is the place you want to hang out and have a good brunch dinner and the late night munchies!!!"}
{"text":"I took my mother here for mothers day and we left very happy. The service was great and quick. Our waitress, Susan was very pleasant and funny. We had the poutine  to start and we devoured that thing. Absolutely amazing. We got a couple drinks too. The cocktails were yummy. The milanesa sandwich and notorious B.I.G. we're both delicious sandwiches. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great service and delicious food and drinks."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood restaurant. The staff is young, energetic and fantastic, includig with the hostess, the waitstaff and the tenders of the bar.   We had the best burger ever - made with the most tender, flavorful brisket! Do not order the fois gras -  very  small portion(2-3 ounces)  and no flavor."}
{"text":"Cool place, we'll done...but, I just had the worst $14 margarita ever.  Frittes (frys) and 2 crappy margies, $45 with tip.   Outragous on a Sunday afternoon.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the best service we have ever received from a restaurant!  Christopher was so personable and knowledgeable.  He has a real passion for the menu, explained the items exquisitely and was very attentive without being intrusive.  Huge bonus:  They are open until 2 a.m.  We just found our new favorite dining option!  We shared the Skirt Steak (medium) and the Frittes.  Both were outstanding and seemed reasonably priced.  The prices did seem fair and honest with no one attempting to up-sell us into getting more than we wanted.    The ambience is nice, clean and fairly casual.  Definitely an easy-going vibe.  The music (we were there around 10 p.m.) started out with some kind of heavy rap (which is not our favorite) and transitioned into some old school classic rap (more melodic) with some R&B mixed in...which was more enjoyable.  Overall:  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good drinks but really awesome food. Focus on the shared plates and try them all!"}
{"text":"The food was very good.  The service on the patio was horrible.  The inside area is beautiful but very noisy.  I would suggest you go, because it is a wonderful restaurant, but be prepared to sit a while."}
{"text":"I was visiting on business and looking for a late night meal. Joe's to the frickin rescue!  Cool jams and movies running at all times. Fun, attentive staff. Great beer selection. Quirky delicious food. A fantastic find, that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food is prepared fresh and flavored are great. Eaten three lunches and all were great. Service is a combined effort, so they on top of any needs."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner this evening. We were really looking forward to trying a new place in the neighborhood  The outdoor patio area was pleasant and nicely set up.  But the music was distracting - it was a weird mix. They couldn't decide on a style - Guns & Roses doesn't really pair well with Hall & Oates. I kinda felt bad for the older couples there on Mother's day; their pained faced told the story.  Now, on to the food:  well, where do I begin?  Disappointing might sum it up.  Even the menu listings are quite confusing. I expected a friendly, neighborhood place, but instead you get some oddities. We started with the appetizers, with a number of options which is a nice idea. The poutine fries were not bad but not really exciting. And like everything else overpriced.  The skirt steak was fair with a chimichurri sauce which some people like and some not so much. I'd fall into the not so much category; it's much too vinegary. In fact it tastes like kelp suspended in vinegar.  Then the hits kept on coming. Next up was the roasted vegetables. Yum! Roasted celery; an exciting dining experience.  One of the roasted potatoes was well roasted and seasoned. The others  - not so much. Hard, unsalted potato anyone? Then, sweetbreads. Sweetbreads are an acquired taste, but this version would not cause anyone to acquire it. Flavorless and slightly gross.  Finally the piece de resistance, the flatbread.  Ours was black with what appeared to be slices of dried bologna seared to perfection. The flatbread also signaled the return of a spectacularly bland tomato puree sauce originally introduced to allegedly complement the unspeakable roasted vegetables.  The beer was quite good.   The place is odd, has no real identity, and is trying to hard to fill a niche that doesn't exist."}
{"text":"Very nice decor, we were pleasantly surprised! We sat at Chefs counter and watched all the food being grilled or cooked on the wood fire. Everything we saw go out looked fantastic. Seems like a great place for brunch, lunch, dinner or late night run. Separate bar area in the back, loved the vibe!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Love this place for a local drinking hole and for late night eats"}
{"text":"Yum!  This place is great!!  Came here tonight with my friend.  I got the mussels...delicious!   She got the skirt steak with roasted red peppers and chimmichuri.  She was so happy :)  The owner introduced himself and was so nice!  Our server was awesome and so attentive :)  The patio looked great, especially with the firepit going.  I'll definitely be back.  Don't miss this spot!  Great vibe, music and most of all service :)"}
{"text":"Last night we were treated very badly. We were regular loyal customers. The hostess laughed at us when we asked to be seated. Said sorry a party of 20 are coming. We can't seat you. I guess our $200 per week bill isn't important enough for her. I will never go back again...stay away"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and drinks. A bit small and crowded."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the music and bar area.  The Notorious B.I.G. burger was on point.  I came hungry and left satisfied.  The music brought my wife and I back to 8th grade which was cool.  Would recommend.  Food was delicious."}
{"text":"Brunch options were fan-tastic at Joe's. To start with drinks, the Bloody Joe's were some of the best Bloody's I've had. They were nice and spicy with a little side car of beer.  I've also never seen flights of mimosas before. Why limit yourself to just orange juice? But to be honest, the orange juice mimosa was probably the best of the bunch (also had grapefruit and guava this trip).  For food, I got the Shrimp & Grits (with a side of bacon). Whoever cooked those shrimp needs to teach the rest of the world how to do it, they were done right. The grits were were an excellent complement, and the bacon was thick and crispy (as it should be). I sampled my friend's Banana French Toast, which was perfect for someone with a sweet tooth. It had plenty of fresh fruit and a side of bacon or sausage. We were both in a food coma afterward.  Additionally, the patio is quiet and allows dogs, and they even have a little doggie menu. The music was on point; they play old school movies (The Sandlot on this trip); and our server, Clayton, was really chill and super friendly. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Here's another semi-newcomer on the getting saturated now 7th st row of restaurants/bars.  Had the flat iron steak found it to be chewy and a bit under cooked, but it wasn't too severe, though the roasted veggies were pretty good, I must say..  Drinks are ok and the place looks pretty cool inside and smells like wood.  However;  the deal breaker for me was Didn't know about the hippy hoppy environment so won't be back."}
{"text":"Pros: music I liked, chill atmosphere Cons: The clams & artichoke were salty. Dishes could have been better but the salt was way to much for my palette.  But will try again"}
{"text":"My family really enjoyed Joe's.  The food was amazing.  The shrimp app, chorizo fries poutine and prime rib special were all amazing.  The service was great and we enjoyed the music and atmosphere too.  Loved the subtle 80's throwback. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We went with a group of three... Food was interesting and will come back for the dining experience. But they have to turn down the music. Way too loud to have a conversation - - and that with a small group. Hopefully, they will adjust the sound to make it more conducive to enjoy a group conversation."}
{"text":"It's refreshing to see some flair and originality. My wife and I stumbled upon this place almost accidentally and immediately fell in love. The atmosphere is cool and mellow with an edgy twist and rough edges that alone make this place unforgettable. The staff is always pleasant and on point. As we became immediate regulars is nice that the staff recognized and appreciated our presence and business. Great beer and wine selection, which our servers and bartender also remember each time we go in. And when your in the mood for a whiskey neat, they are quick to let you sample their best. If we're in a drinking mood we always sit at the bar, Sean the bartender is one of the best, most professional bartenders I've met, always has great recommendations. We've eaten almost every item on the menu and it's still hard to make a choice every time we go in. There is not a single flavor, dish, side, sauce, or garnish that is less than 110%. My wife loves the chicken skewers with couscous, I lean towards the pulpo and the liver pate with blackberry jam. The list goes on, it's all delicious, and just when you think it cant get better.. nearly everything is cooked over open fire wood charcoal. The Chef Michael, whom we've had the pleasure of speaking with only once has really outdone himself, There are very few chefs now a days who aren't afraid to let their passion shine through their techniques and recipes. Well done, you'll definitely be seeing us again soon."}
{"text":"I've been there twice in the past week.   Food is A+++.  Interesting flavors and excellent preparation.  I've tasted the wings, cauliflower, grilled romaine salad, heritage tomato salad, arroz negro, and ahi fish tacos.     Sat at a table and at the bar.  On both trips we asked for the volume to be turned down.  We were told that the owner has it on auto and likes the vibe.  Should note that there were only twelve customers there last time and seven customers in the place today.     As much as I like the food, I want to enjoy the people I'm with.  I see from other reviews that the patio is better for sound.  I guess that will have to wait for a few months."}
{"text":"I loved love loooooved Joe's. It was so yummy. It was my first time there and I saw Biggie on the menu and knew I had to take one of my friends with me, who enjoyed it as well. The atmosphere flows so well with the design of the place. The food, I ordered a Notorious B.I.G. Burger because I saw all the amazing reviews on it. And I was not disappointed. It had so much flavor and it was so yummy. It was a beautiful night to sit on the patio, which is also dog friendly. Restrooms were clean. The movies playing on the screen were great.  The service was a little slow. But they were also really busy and people kept loading in, the food totally made up for it!  They definitely did not disappoint. And I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for 90s hip hop and R&B music and great food,  so as you can imagine I'm like a fat kid in a giant candy store.  The menu can be pretty adventurous for the daring ones willing to try something new and different (bone marrow and sweet breads anyone?) but it can also be less intimidating and familiar (grilled chicken wings and burger).  We've been here twice and have tried some different things. Fries-great especially if you add steak, cheese, and gravy, skirt steak-cooked perfectly, peppers-good but wish they added more spicy ones to the mix, bone marrow-too small for the price,but ok, mussels-you'll get your money's worth with the amazing broth alone, grilled wings-amazing, drinks-yes please, and dessert-Apple tart thingamajig is \"bomb diggity\" (sorry had to drop a 90s phrase there). We've had great service on both occasions.  They tolerated me and my love of 90s hiphop R&B, bad lip syncing, and partying like it's 1999.  Go with an open mind, order a 40 (for real that's what you can get), eat some good food, and relax and listen to some good music."}
{"text":"I was really excited to experience Joe's Midnight Run.  Great location and nice to have another North Central restaurant.  But, unfortunately, that's where the compliments end...at least for now.  I get it.  We went the first Friday they were open and I'm sure they were a bit  overwhelmed trying to get their groove.  But, Joe's Midnight Run has a long way to go before we'd go back.  The front of the house and the back of the house aren't communicating.  I think the vision for Joe's is a bit convoluted. The restaurant name suggests fast casual but the menu and the experience is anything but fast and although the decor is casual, the menu choices are a mishmash between casual and upscale.  We were seated at the chefs' counter where we could watch the chefs in action. Typically this is a lot of fun, but watching them for the 2 hours we were at Joe's was disappointing.  They didn't smile or talk to one another nor did they even acknowledge we (or any other customer) was in front of them watching what should have been them showing off their cooking skills.  There just didn't seem to be anyone leading the kitchen or taking charge.  Upon being seated, it took 15 minutes to be brought water and be greeted by a server.  We immediately placed our drink, appetizer and dinner order figuring the restaurant was going to start getting busy.  After waiting 45 minutes, we hadn't received our drinks.  After saying something, they came out.  We finally started getting food served after an hour, but there was no semblance of order.  An appetizer came out, then 1 dinner came out, then another appetizer. We certainly couldn't eat together.  And remember, we're watching what's happening behind the counter and there was not a lot of activity. Sadly our water glasses remained empty most of the 2 hour meal.  Although the grilled Pulpo (octopus) was tasty, I think Executive Chef, Michael Goldsmith's attempt to bring sweet breads, grilled pulpo and bone marrow which are usually served in more upscale restaurants onto a menu with black-eyed peas, grilled wings and flatbreads leaves the customers confused.  Are they going out for fine dining or fun and fast in a neighborhood customer-centric casual space.    The \"Notorius B.I.G. Burger\" with beef, braised pork, cheese and chicharrones was impressive, but the menu lacked just a simple burger.  They had Oven Roasted Foie Gras, but serve skirt steak on the menu which is typically a cheaper cut but can be trendy.  The Ahi Tuna Sandwich was just fair.  Didn't taste the Ahi in all the bread.  After 2 hours, we didn't have the patience to wait for dessert.  May go back in a few months after they've had a chance to work out the kinks.  But for now, we'll just enjoy the many other exciting restaurants opening in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Really awesome place! Service was great and music was nostalgic!  Favorite dish is the Korean barbecue with fresh Kim-chi!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome! My boyfriend and I loved the ambience and the music! The food was really really tasty and not to overpriced. Not a lot of options on the menu but that's fine what they had was variable. The server was attentive and the manager was super pleasant! It can be casual or dress up. Bday dinner or a late night run ;)"}
{"text":"Going out and having a drink is one thing....but this is on an entirely different level, the vibe is just that dope.  This is my new favorite place.   Picture if you will. some of the illest rap (old and new) and R & B music, combined with excellent service and delicious food. Now let that sink in...sitting around the bar reminiscing with any number of patrons about the music, the artists or just how fantastic the bone marrow or skirt steak is.   If you are not hip, progressive and in love with rap music, this place ain't for you."}
{"text":"We went to brunch with a friend on Saturday morning to celebrate her birthday and brought our dogs too. The place was quiet both inside and out. We stuck to the patio where we could hang out with our dogs. We all enjoyed our meals, and the prices . Mimosas, French toast, steak and eggs, and shrimp and grits. Thanks to our waiter for letting us know that the full-sized mimosas were a better value than the mimosa flights! He also brought a s'more on the house for the birthday girl.   While mostly friendly, our waiter exhibited some truly bizarre behavior: snapping at us to keep our dogs on the ground, being condescending to our friend (\"Have you ever had a mimosa before? Is this your first time getting one?\"), and for talking about his previous meth addiction... at length.  I would totally return to try the other delicious menu items, but I think we would all prefer to have a different waiter!"}
{"text":"The server at night looked like she was ready to get off ... the steak was good but they don't have any steak sauce"}
{"text":"Nice small place with urban atmosphere. Actually really like the food especially the burger is really something maybe my favorite."}
{"text":"Will update this after they've been open longer but since I've now been here twice in a week...let's just talk happy hour.  First experience they were slammed on a Saturday evening and we told them we were just there for cocktails. Was expecting a little attitude given how busy they were, but got none of that. Hostess was very accommodating. They seated us at the kitchen rail and we had great service, along with great cocktails. Big fan of the Joe's Stiffy. Just saying. Was fun to watch the guys cook and the service seemed really well oiled, especially considering they're still really new and they had zero room to move around.   Second experience was a much more chill Monday happy hour. Sat at the bar. Again, very chill. And wine on tap! Back to the Future on TV! Old school jams on the radio! I could move in here. Bartender checked back enough to be attentive but not so much as to be creepy. A+. Seemed like a lot of people working the floor for such a small place but I bet they are still figuring out what they really need and everyone looked busy so more power to them.   Suggestions for improvement all have to do with the buildout. The big skylight makes it bake in the middle of the building and the AC over the bar cranks the whole time to make up for it. Spacing on the seating could be easily remedied if only it weren't for the big concrete curb in the center under the booths. These are all things that can be fixed with some additional investment, or just left alone and it will be what it will be. Other than those little thing the place feels cozy and funky and fun. They did a good job here and they seem invested in running a high quality operation. Hurray!"}
{"text":"Well where to start... well, the ambiance of the restaurant is first and foremost very appealing to the eye. It's been beautifully designed and draws your attention from the regular dining seating, cooks area and bar.   When we entered for dinner, we stood for aprx 5 mins until being greeted by anyone and were slightly confused if we were to just seat ourselves. Mind you it was 8pm but still we didn't want to intrude. We were eventually greeted and sat by the manager and were not waited on until another 10-15 mins.   Then we met our waitress. She greeted my partner and then myself, and I could have swore she sniffed me. After she took my order I asked my partner if he thought she sniffed me and he wasn't sure then. As the night progressed it became more apparent that she did indeed sniff me and ended the evening by lightly scratching my back. We signaled multiple times that we were ready to go and it just seemed to go completely over our waitresses head.   After she stopped lightly scratching my back and wandered over to one of her other tables, we made a dart for the exit in hopes to not be stopped by her again.  The entire dining experience left a lot to be desired and quite frankly we don't understand why/how it was so busy when we arrived. The salmon dinner I got was easily beat by a regular Red Lobster salmon dinner for half the price."}
{"text":"Tasteful late-night munch. The atmosphere was welcoming and relaxing. The open kitchen concept gave it a persona feel. The food was exquisite and creative. We had mussels in a garlic White wine broth, charbroiled scallops over a bed of crispy panchetta and kale -which was a bit salty but the scallops were amazing (they were perfectly cook and not chewy). Followed up by marinated flat iron steak which was served with a bed of truffled mushrooms and the also the notorious big burger- which was perfectly cooked and had various flavors that were complementary to each other. The food was great, and if this was a review only for the food we would give it a 5 star however the service was not in harmony with the quality of food. We waited 15 minutes to be acknowledged and then another 20 to be given the drinks ordered."}
{"text":"Took my brother & son for a nice dinner on their patio & Joe's did not disappoint. We walked on & were promptly greeted & seated. The service was great, the food was perfect. I will say if you order the B.I.G. burger, go for regular fries as the ones with gravy etc., are overkill for that dish. Try the black rice appetizer, absolutely delicious. It's unfortunate that the only drawback are patrons who feel entitled to act foolish & make their misery part of the outside world, but no one can control that other than the ones who act out their childish needs. . Otherwise, a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Hip hop quotes upon entering. Ok ok than beer a Koffe K?lsch by Huss Brewing served in 40oz bottle. Place is dope. Foods good & Staff is chill and helpful. Seen a wood fired stove and a wild grill which was explained to me is an Argentinian grill. I had small plates of Grilled Pulpo and Roasted Veggies. Both fire"}
{"text":"1st class loved this place. Original great people and location we love.  Phoenix has some amazing restaurants food is amazing must go."}
{"text":"The experience started when my hand felt the texture of the door...  But really - this place was both bigger, nicer and more interesting than I expected. Me and my party only went for some beer and apps, instead of the Dagwood Bumstead style burgers that they apparently do sell. So I feel I didn't truly have enough to give a culinary account of this place yet, but I can regarding the ambiance and service.  I did sample the skirt steak and the scallops, and as not being a fan of scallops - the presentation was amazing. Scallops and tomatoes, on New Potatoes (where do they get those) and kale. It was really sweet to see. Beer list is less impressive than the wine list, but the selection is a great diverse one.  It was a comfortable place to spend a few hours discussing whether to pho or not to pho, if that is even a question. Discussing burgers and hops, and what to give your friends that have everything. It was a blast.   The service was attentive and personable - yet being a European, a little too 'on' for my preference - as is so popular on the west side of the continent. I am more into \"let me be, and when I am in need I will make myself noticed\". But this is no dealbreaker whatsoever.  A fresh take, yet not that original - I still hope it lasts. I will give them mad props for the Sensei Kreese picture in the bathroom. Very awesome, made me want to wash my hands and then go out and sweep the leg on the first hipster I saw."}
{"text":"Really cool new place! Good beer on tap, the rotating tap was the Russian imperial stout which was yummy and complex. Great atmosphere, nice patio. Unfortunately we had already eaten but did get dessert of caramelized strawberries and oranges which was delish! Love the open kitchen as well. Will definitely be back to try the food. Also try a specialty cocktail called \"the chunk\" peanut butter thing with a caramel rimmed glass, heaven!"}
{"text":"I went for the family and friends opening IT WAS GREAT! I loved the food and the atmosphere. The thing I loved the most was there is only ONE female in the kitchen and she rocked it Chef Nicole is the BEST!"}
{"text":"The food was so different and amazing! Not like a typical restaurant. You get to try tastes from all around the globe and they even put their own spin on some of them. The foie gras is out of this world! Drinks are great and the prices are very reasonable. I can't wait to take friends and family to try this place!"}
{"text":"Food and service were overall amazing!   Waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. The restaurant has a gorgeous and quirky ambience. We sat outside and enjoyed the patio.  My friend and I ordered: -wings (decent, grilled, and saucy) -scallops (perfect) -oysters (decent) -Notorious B.I.G. Burger was juicy and the cole slaw pairing danced on my tongue  (*I skipped the pork toppings, which took away from it.)  Great happy hour prices! It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"We've been to Joe's twice now and both times had a great experience. The servers are attentive and do a good job of clearing plates in between courses. Our server this time (Clayton) explained that they have no heat lamps so food is brought out as it comes up. Their menu reminds me of tapas, and is plated and priced that way, so food coming out at different times is logical. It does take a little longer for plates to come out, but after sitting at the bar in front of the kitchen it makes sense; EVERYTHING is fresh and made on the wood fired grill (plus they play awesome classics like The Big Lebowski to entertain you while you wait.) We have tried a good variety of menu items at this point; mushrooms, skirt steak, short ribs, veggies, Shishito peppers, Notorious B.I.G., Tartine, Strawberries and Oranges. I got the peppers and the steak twice because I enjoyed them so much. Everything is seasoned well, I loved the Romesco on the veggie plate.   I think this spot caters mostly to industry people and to a late night crowd, which some people don't get, despite the name. It's frustrating when you get out of work late and the only food around is fast food. Joe's has great music, good food (which the price is fair for), and it's fun. Phoenix needs more places like this and honestly, I feel like the people who don't feel that way just don't understand it. I'm tired of just burgers and fries at bars, so thank you Joe's."}
{"text":"Normally I wait a few hours before posting a review but today I had to make an exception. We ordered from the shorties menu(shareable plates). The Roasted Pulpo was beyond words.... I love and eat sea food every chance I get and growing up around fresh seafood some of my favorite dishes always had octopus. Joe's Version was just as good if not better than any I have tasted in other parts of the world. Bravo estaba rico! Love the 80's vibe with the music to boot, just something about Easy E and Da Brat on the wheels of steel! Beer was cold and the service was super attentive. The Notorious Big Burger was voluptuous. Just come to Joe's you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"We came for some late night grub and what we ordered was amazing: poutine and wings. The side sauces were great- especially the cool/lime/heaven for the wings. The best part though, our server. Michael was so attentive and funny- cherry on our Sundae. We had a blast when we were only expecting alright bites."}
{"text":"My son wanted to go there this afternoon, so we went.  This is a fairly new place and will likely do well.  Nice decor, trying to be hip and as the person I think was the owner or the manager said to us they want it to be a fun experience.  The food is an eclectic blend of dishes from various places.  My son had the \"B.I.G\" burger.  It looked very interesting and unique.  Come hungry if you want to eat it.  He's fairly picky and didn't care for it, but it was definitely unique and if it appeals to you, I would try it.  The manager/owner (I think that's who waited on us) comped it because my son didn't eat to much of it.  He was not fishing for the dish to be comped and said it was ok a couple of time.  The fact that they comped it anyway shows that this is and will be a quality place.  I had Milanesa sandwich.  Another unique entry and it will likely find it's fans.  It's big as well.  Both dishes came with fries and the fries were great.  Service was just so so.  Perhaps because we came in the middle of the afternoon between the rushes.  I had to ask for lemon for my water four different times (once when I ordered from our waiter the manager/owner, once from the person who brought the water, again from the manager/owner when he took our order and lastly again from the person who brought the water in the first place).    Bottom line (and based on the other positive reviews) I think we were just there at the wrong time.  This is the kind of place which will do well on a Friday night, catering to a crowd which is 25 - 50, who likes to drink and is out having a good time for the night."}
{"text":"disappointed.  from the positive reviews i was expecting good/great food.  the food was cold (waiter explained that it was left in the kitchen too long).  the unknown wine was expensive.  too bad as they had a good idea."}
{"text":"Great service from the bar. Ordered an app to go. Will be back again for a full lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Joe's Midnight Run and it says right in the title, RUN there if you're in Arizona!! Best food, service, and atmosphere!! Tonight we had fresh grilled Chipotle Honey glazed with cilantro lime crema and the sauce is perfect, the crema takes the flavors to a new level. We also had fresh grilled artichokes with garlic aioli that was out of this world! Not picture ( because I ate it way to fast) is shrimp with black rice , homemade chorizo, piquillo peppers and sauce. I mean this is my favorite dish ever. The sauce goes absolutely amazing. But the homemade chorizo is an amazing addition, it is bursting with flavor. Now Desert Chef Mike makes S'mores with Fresh-made marshmallows and graham crackers!!!! Such a great finish to an amazing dinner! Also their wine list and cocktails list is FANTASTIC!!! I mean I've been to this restaurant 3 times in 2 weeks if you go ask for Micheal, sweetest, most attentive server ever!"}
{"text":"Went to Joe's last night for the first time and I'm so glad I did! Phoenix was in desperate need of a nice late night restaurant & Joe's answered the call. Loved everything about this place from the food to the ambience to the music, the wait staff & bartender. We got there at midnight so the restaurant wasn't very crowded but the vibe was nice! I Immediately fell in love with the lyrics painted on the outside walls as well as the walls inside the restaurant. The picture of TLC in the bathroom was cute too! We ordered the skirt steak and the Korean style short ribs. Both were very delicious and and prepared perfectly and the chimichurri sauce that came with the skirt steak was incredible! I think I found my new favorite spot!! Can't wait to sit on the patio when the weather is cooler."}
{"text":"Fun throwback music and wicked cool interior vibe. This old liquor store has been converted to a small but mighty restaurant and bar. The depth and textures of materials used include brick, metal and dark emerald green tile luring you to the bar like the Wizard of Oz. We had a lite late dinner...Caesar with chicken salad, Fish tacos and for me the liver pate. The food was Good and the portion sizes were perfect in the pricing to match. Not too much but just a smidge more than actually needed. Bob the owner made it a point to come visit and check in and our server Matt was genuine, pleasant and attentive. Music as noted was fab particularly for the late 30s to late 40s crowd (although my 72/80 year old parents got into it as well), but a bit too loud to have a normal voice conversation. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We really like this place. The decor is industrial chic, located in a former liquor store. The food options are ever changing. They offer a full bar with a specialty in local beers. For the food, their are both small plates to share and regular size entrees. Their burger, which includes coldslaw and pulled pork is delious. They have both inside and patio dining. The service is first class, especially Chris. They are knowledgeable in both their food and bar selections, just ask. We really enjoy both the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here around 10pm on a busy Friday night. We grabbed corner seats at the bar that I felt lucky we found! We ordered 4 different specialty cocktails, and no one was disappointed! I had \"The Chunk\". Normally  I'm not a huge fan of caramel, but this was delicious.   Second time I came back I sat at the bar alone and ordered the \"Peruvian Sunrise\" cocktail and the \"Skirt Steak\" ($10). Drink was great, and the meal was delicious! The peppers are to die for.   Service was exceptional. Meghan was my bartender :) will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night to check this new spot for dinner, the interior of the restaurant was nice as was the small patio out front. Service was decent, however...... The food......well the food was very underwhelming,  and when I say that I mean extremely stingy. I ordered the Ahi Tuna plate entree which was listed under \"Biggies\"....... What arrived at my table was a complete joke, Seriously, this is it????? Was immediately what came to my mind.  I was presented with five small slices fanned out.... Which couldn't have been more then a 4oz piece of tuna total, half of which were completely over cooked.  It was supposed to come with grilled pineapple..... This was in a salad of sorts with chiles and shallots all scattered about the plate more as what looked like a garnish, there may have been 4 tiny cubes of pineapple in there with no evidence of grill marks or anything because it was that small.    Just a tip if you feel like checking this joint out for yourself, ask questions about what comes with your entrees because this is apparently an over priced a la carte menu.  I left there after dropping $60 including tip for 2 \"Biggies\" and a underwhelming \"full\" salad......and had to make a stop at In-n-Out satisfy my still empty stomach.    Overpriced, I won't be back.....too many good restaurants in the area who are wiling to dish out what you pay for."}
{"text":"Joe's is one of my favorite places to eat and hang out. I love the mood and the staff makes me feel super welcome! (Shout out to Nate, Sean, and Missy.)  I tend to eat healthy and they have some great chicken and salads, but if I want to indulge, they have burgers and ribs too. The dog friendly patio is a huge plus. Their prices are reasonable. I will be back soon, and I recommend to friends any chance I get. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"First of all, the architecture here is gorgeous. The smell of burning wood when you walk in is wonderful, & the staff is warm & friendly when they greet you. In fact, the service was warm & friendly throughout.   Sadly, it was not all positive. Four of us came for breakfast & drinks. We all ordered simple dishes right off the menu. The entirety of the movie, Superman played while were there. This was not because we wanted to be there so long. The food & drink service was unbelievably slow. I waited over an hour for bacon & eggs. Friends had mimosas, & then wanted to get a bottle of wine, so they asked for the wine menu. By the time the waiter came back, we were ready to leave, so they skipped it.   All in all, we were there for almost 2 hours for no reason. I'm not sure if their problem lies in the kitchen, with servers, or with management, but they need to fix it fast. By the way, our food arrived at different times, & my eggs were cold. I didn't even bother to mention it, because we had been there waiting so long for food that I just ate them cold & cut my losses."}
{"text":"Yelped this place and was excited to eat here. Arrived and there was a party ahead of us per the hostess. We reiterated to a second hostess who informed us that would be coming up next we would prefer an inside seat if it became available as I am noticing one being cleaned and clarified with her how many parties were ahead of us. A party walks in after us and gets on the list. I see the hostesses having a combo about the inside table. I then ask again about the inside table and now get two different answers from hosts as I watch the group that came in after us be seated inside. At this point I return there menus we were reviewing, inform the hostess that I watched that all that play out.  Not good costumer service by any means and sucks because I really wanted to try this place out.   Stopped down the street at Stock and Stable, also busy, got great customer service. The little things really matter!!!"}
{"text":"There are so many positives about Joes!  First the bar is exquisite and very good customer service.  We love the interior metal work. The music is awesome. It's cohesive but not too loud so you can enjoy your company. We had warm olives to start- so Delish!  Then the grilled wings- also very good and we are tough critics on wings!  Lastly we split the BIG burger. Very yummy. And huge. We were thankful we split!  Also impressive was that the owner was there serving dinners. Great customer service. Additionally we ran into lots of people we knew. Phoenix hang out!  This could easily become our go-to spot."}
{"text":"Great vibe and amazing food. Love the scallops and the salads are so tasty. Definitely worth a visit"}
{"text":"Tried this place as a brunch location after a good hike on Sunday morning. We ordered the delicious Bloody Joes, listened to some Joan Jett and other 80-90's genre music and then enjoyed the Shasuka (best in the city by far) and a new asian noodle dish with a side of Frites. This asian noodle dish is easily one of the best composed and balanced dish we have had in any type of restaurant in the Valley. The entire experience was very satisfying and we are already making plans to return after we looked at the dinner menu. Thank you for the excellent service and ambiance."}
{"text":"90s hip hop sold me at door. Food was very good! Service was great!!!  I recommend the salmond! Medium cooked to perfection ... I'm only sad I didn't take the Garbage Pail Kids book that came with my check."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I was unsure about going because the menu was so small and the first thing I read was burger. But the place seemed very fancy and the old school rap music gave the place a cool hip atmosphere. The food took a little longer than expected to come out but oh was it worth the wait. The bone marrow, pot one and flat iron steak were all phenomenal. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  The grilled romaine salad is to die for!!  Sangria was pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"I liked this place. The food was good and so was the beer.  Not sure what the connection to the 80's is but the service is good and the atmosphere is very cool.  With so many choices in the area, I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Another far below average establishment with gimmicky fare.  Most of these new restaurants wouldn't survive if it weren't for a largely unsophisticated local dining population.  Should have stayed a liquor store. ***UPDATE*** Rick, could you be any more disconnected or dishonest???  I had NO problem being seated.  Your restaurant was almost empty.  Creating an issue that doesn't exist makes you even less trusting.  When the public reads my review AND reads your response, well, let's just say your response doesn't fit my review."}
{"text":"Wow, what a waste of time.  Recently moved to the area, and we've been exploring restaurants and bars. Rode by this place last week after a great dinner at Otro Cafe next door and thought we should give it a try.  Weird layout; booths with giant cylinder pillows on the left, and there's a long bar facing into the glass partition in front of the open kitchen on the right. Seems like a waste to me. We sat at the small bar at the back. There's a lot of stupid shit stenciled on the wall. Don't know why someone would choose random lyrics from mediocre 90's songs to decorate their restaurant, but what do I know?  Menu sucks. Perused it multiple times, but we could not find one item that really seemed intriguing. Everything had an unnecessary hip twist to it that I'm not into. Just make the best fucking burger you can without adding a bunch of dumb crap to it. After reading other reviews, portions seem to be absurdly small for the price. Saw only one other person at the bar order food, and when it arrived, it looked very meh. Bullet dodged here.   Specialty drinks were the same story. Odd combos for the most part, and pretty much all of them were unappealing. We stuck to their small selection of beers.   Service was abysmal. Bartender was inattentive and not very friendly. Seemed more preoccupied with drying dishes and socializing with other employees and vendors than taking care of customers.   And the music! Holy shit. It was cranked up so loud that my girlfriend and I could hardly carry on a conversation without yelling. Even worse was the fact that it was lame, adult contemporary, smooth, easy listening garbage. Who are they playing that for? Especially given their \"theme\" of 90's rap and pop music. Very odd.   We stayed for one drink and left. This place is trying way to hard to be cool. Skip this one, unless you're into overpriced hipster hell-holes with dismissive service and unappetizing hip menu selections."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Outstanding service. Great prices. Late night hours. The scallops were melt in your mouth. Notorious BIG burger is delicious. Save room for the caramelized bananas."}
{"text":"Meh.  I got the pulpo appetizer and the octopus was cooked well however the seasoning used was reminiscent of a Ramen flavor packet.  Not impressed.    My date got the bone marrow appetizer and it was incredibly underwhelming for the price.  Sure the ambience is nice, but we left after the apps because we were so disappointed.   I couldn't bring myself to try an entree after such spectacular fails in the appetizers.   Will I be back?  Probably not."}
{"text":"I can't do more than 3 stars on this one. The atmosphere is great, the open kitchen is beautiful. However, there are lots of problems. First, they don't have any heating lamps so food comes out as it's cooked. Which is strange when you get your side before you even come close to getting your main entrée. We had the short ribs, Korean style, which were good. The chop salad and the grilled octopus were fine. However, the Porkchop was so salty I could not eat it.  They tasted it and agreed it was too salty and took it off my bill and even bought me a beer, so they were very accommodating, but the fact that I couldn't even eat my entrée was brutal. In the future I would come here strictly for appetizers and drinking. The music is phenomenal the feel of the place is great but the food needs to be worked out a bit before I would come back and actually eat a meal here."}
{"text":"I love the 90s! and the 40s this place serves their beers in! Definitely enjoyed my birthday here with a large group of friends and the staff was awesome! They took care of us. The 90s hip hop was a blast. Definitely stop in for dinner and a forty."}
{"text":"We came here as a group of 5 (with one child) on a Sunday at noon. It wasn't busy and we took a seat outside but quickly had to move in because there was no shade. The larger tables inside were set against a booth on one side that was really deep and low. So you end up eating like T-Rex with your arms all high and close to your body or sitting really far back from the table (and then my feet dangled.) Comfy for drinking mimosas, not so much for cutting waffles.   Speaking of mimosas we probably tried all the flavors between the three of us. Strawberry was my favorite. They use a rosé champagne so some of them are a little weird. At $3, they are a good deal but not especially strong.   The atmosphere is fun, our service was pretty good, but I felt the food was just eh...especially for the price. I'd give this place 3.5 if I could but as it stands, it's A-OK with me. If it was close to my house, I'd probably come back."}
{"text":"I love this place.   Food is tasty and unique.   Very comfortable.   Service is outstanding.   I will be back."}
{"text":"This place has a kick ass atmosphere. The music they play here is awesome and they had on The Sandlot when we came to eat here for the first time the other night. One issue that I did have was the volume of the music, I had a hard time speaking to my buddy that was sitting in front of me because the music was pretty loud. Basically had to yell across the table to communicate. But the interior was cool and the kitchen is open for customers to watch the cooks put together your meal.  They have a nice large selection of alcohol. I ordered the flat iron steak cooked medium rare. It sat on a bed of roasted brussel sprouts and mushrooms. My steak was cooked beautifully and it was seasoned very well. My girlfriend ordered from the shortie side and had the chicken skewers which she too enjoyed. The price and portions however make this a place a restaurant that we will probably only visit when celebrating a special occasion or for late night bites when everything else is closed or if we are looking for a light dinner."}
{"text":"Visited today for brunch. I had the biscuit and chorizo gravy with an over easy egg on top. Delicious! My son had the banana French toast. Yummy. The place is very clean and the service was great. We will be back."}
{"text":"Since I first contacted Rick through email for a group reservation, I knew I had picked a great spot! Wish I could have thanked him personally! We were made to feel right at home, by the two gentlemen who helped us throughout our visit. I wish I could have take their names...the food was good and portions were perfect! Not to mention the choices of drinks...the only reason I didn't go for 5 stars is bc when we first arrived as we were waiting for the rest of our guests, we sat at the bar for a few minutes...the bartender wasn't very friendly. We first asked if she could make a Michelada, no reply just a face...then I asked if she knew where they would be seating us to which she replied \"I don't know\", which is ok, but she didn't bother to look into it for us, she just went on with what she was doing. Maybe she was having a bad morning...IDK."}
{"text":"Saturday night and nowhere to go, decided to try Joe's Midnight Run. So glad we did!! From the time we walked in to the time we left, we felt like we were the only people there. Ambiance is perfect, Clayton is knowledgeable, personable, and very attentive. There is something on the menu for everyone (the Notorious Big Burger, Chicken Skewers and Tart Tartin are must tries). Bob Mayo and his team have created something truly special! Don't miss an opportunity to experience this unique place!"}
{"text":"The food here is incredible! The service impeccable and friendly! They have a nice selection of wines, beers and cocktails and to top it all off, the music is amazing! We didn't want to leave. Absolutely loved the 90's hip hop they were playing. My friend and I ordered a few different items off the menu and shared since neither of us could only pick one. We started with the cantina poutine and it came our piping hot and tasty. We devoured this while waiting for our two other \"entrees\". Our server was nice to offer to spread our items out so they didn't all arrive at once. We had the flatbread of the night and cannot remember what was on it but it was made really well and was the perfect amount of food to share. We also ordered the mussels and even though I order these often when I'm out, these had a really fantastic flavor in the broth and were probably my favorite item we ordered. Definitely will be back! Thanks for the great meal and service."}
{"text":"This place rocked!  Great fun happy hour vibe!  We all got small plates- shishito peppers, wings, flatbread, chimi steak, frites, and something else I think!!!  Everything was excellent- standouts were the frites which are made how fries should be made, and the steak was cooked perfectly!!!  All sauces and accompaniments were delish!  Drinks were great as well, and my husband loved getting a forty!!!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. I love the 90s vibe of the spot. The food is okay. It's very hit and miss. The bone marrow was super legit. Lots of flavor to it. The wings were sub par and over cooked  The reason for my low score review is due to the staff. I overhead the cook in the kitchen (colorful hair) calling a customer a \"douch bag\" because he ordered a non bun burger. To me, that is completely unacceptable. Not only was she rude at that point, but she was making comments towards me after hours about how how I took the 40oz(which they served to me) outside of the restaurant, as I explained to her that I was throwing it away. Her attitude alone is the reason for this low rating. I am completely understating that the customer ISNT always right, but the level of disrespect that I saw from this employee is completely unacceptable from any paying customer. Normally I would've just blown this off but this is definitely overtly unacceptable."}
{"text":"Overall we were not very happy. The food was over-priced and way too salty. I ordered the same thing I would at Zin Burger, a glass of wine and the ahi tuna sandwich, their wine was $3 more per glass and the sandwich was $2 more and not even close to what Zin Burger can do. Waited a really long time to be waited on and the waitress couldn't explain the menu. Menu was difficult to understand, font was super small, and had a ton of typos (znfandel instead of Zinfandel, and port instead of pork)."}
{"text":"Thank God Phoenix has a spot like this. Great food- the Notorious BIG Burger is divine and the Arroz Negro is one of the best dishes I've ever eaten. Cool people- the waiters are friendly and normal. The best music- they play real hip hop. Open late night- Ima roll thru after every concert from now on. Thanks Joe's for killin it everytime!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Went in for brunch and the food was fantastic! We ordered the scrapple, a pancake, and the banana french toast. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Nice place with a great dog friendly patio.  B I G burger was silly and showy but when you broke it down it was tasty.  All food really good.  Wish they had a good lunch menu.  Would come a lot more during the day"}
{"text":"The vibe of this place is amazing! I felt as if I traveled back in time to the 1990's! Music and movies in the restaurant are played all day long from that era, which is very awesome! Menu is minimal but the food was very tasty! Very nostalgic place, definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great music ! Portions are to small for the prices. . I won't be going back anytime soon.."}
{"text":"Don't get much variety here in PHX but this place is on my list of place to go. Dope music, global food selection and cool chill vibe. Oh and shout out my waiter Chris-- he went above and beyond. I would go back."}
{"text":"Had to leave a review because we were just so pleased with our experience. Awesome place!! We came in for brunch to celebrate my husband's birthday. The menu was diverse and the food we decided to get was delicious! I couldn't  believe how perfect all the eggs were cooked. My mimosa was fabulous!! Fresh squeezed juice, guys!! We had the most wonderful server! Charity was so friendly and sincere, and she went above and beyond to explain the menu and answer our questions. We were a little needy, as we had to move when a friend decided to join us, and we were kind of slow on getting food ordered. Still, our server was patient and made us feel welcomed. I'd like to come back for dinner and I NEED to come back for brunch. I wanted to order 5 different things, and had to pick only one!"}
{"text":"This is currently our favorite place in the neighborhood -- we've been back 4 times in the past week. Can you say addicted?   I love the atmosphere, they play 90s hiphop and 80s movies. We sat at different places each time we've gone, and each area gives you a different vibe. We sat in the patio area, the bar area facing the open kitchen and just a regular table. My favorite by far is the bar area -- I really enjoyed watching them cook and prepare the food. Makes me want to eat and order everything. The patio area was nice at night, it felt intimate, but it was just getting a little hot for me.   The first time we tried the bone marrow, mussels, and notorious B.I.G. Burger. The mussels were my favorite, so good, I love dipping the bread in their sauce! The bone marrow was ok, I enjoyed the marrow itself but I didn't like the toppings that it came with. The burger sounded so good, pork with chicharones on top? But it wasn't as good as I hope it would be. But that didn't stop us from coming back!  The wings were good, but I thought they were small. I wouldn't order it again. The skirt steak.... I recommend though, it's the best! It comes with a chimchurri sauce and red peppers but the steak itself was just cooked so perfectly! I love their side of fries -- I love the sauce that it comes with. Wow! Garlic aioli and curry ketchup. I don't understand how I've lived without curry ketchup! I could just eat their fries with that all day! My bfs favorite is the poutine, he loves fries and cheese and this definitely doesn't disappoint!   This used to be an old drive thru liquor store so they serve a 40 oz in a brown bag! I thought that was cool! It's busier on Friday night than on a Saturday. I'm probably going back to try more of their apps next time. I love coming here, service is amazing! Everybody's so friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"This is a great date night spot for you and your date. Great indoor & outdoor seating. Entrees are fairly prices along with their cocktails. Only drawback is their limited cocktails and wait time for food. Popular Items: The Notorious BIG, Porkchop (pictured) and Flank Steak!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal and fantastic service last night!  The Muscles were to die for. The grilled Salmon on my Joes Chopped Salad was perfectly cooked !  The Scallops were wonderful! Everything was fantastic including the restaurant decor. Very hip very stylish a great place to hang out !  The ceiling tiles alone are worth the trip to the restaurant to sit below them and have a drink!   Speaking of drinks I do think the margaritas should be a little larger. But ya can't have everything.  All in all 5 stars fantastic and will be back many more times!"}
{"text":"Great to see a local place come back with more character than before! It's great that this isn't a chain or franchise.  Amazing food!"}
{"text":"Awesome environment with great hip hop and rap music over the last century.  I had the Notorious B.I.G burger,  You definitely need a knife and fork to dive into this burger.  Great date night place, also a great place to meet friends!"}
{"text":"After Yelp feautured Joe's in its weekly midtown update of places to check out, hubby and I did just that on date night yesterday. They had us at 80's hip hop!! This place is small and cozy and definitely brings that old school feel you get when you hear a Snoop or Sir Mix a lot cut from the 90s and everyone yells....ohhhhhhhhh..that's my jam!! Little in the middle but she got much back... Lol. That's the perfect way to describe this place... Little in the middle but it packs a punch of heart and nostslgia for the days when 40s in brown paper bags were the lay of the land, Eddie Murphys laugh was a house hold favorite and we got together with friends in person vs. texting them or messaging on face book. Now how can you enjoy a 40 in a brown bag with Mr.T on it with your buddies online.. You can't. So get your happy self over to Joe's. The playlist we learned from the owner was purposely crafted over 2 months with 80s, 90s favorites and explicit lyrics starting at 9pm for adults. Now that's what I'm talking about. Harlem Nights playing on the Tvs, a hip hop favorite playing while enjoying some delicious skirt steak and wings. Incredible!  Now I have to clarify this place is only old school in vibe yet you don't have to drink 40s.. The craft cocktail options are divine, the food is fit for foodies, crystal clear spotless wine glasses with various wine options to fill them suitable for royalty as the entire staff works like a well oiled machine cleaning, shining glasses, arranging silverware, delivering food, checking on guests, making time for a personal connection with all. We chatted with Rick the owner who was very friendly and humble, thanking us for visiting and then he was right in there with staff washing dishes and ensuring no hand was idle in the place. It operates like a well oiled machine you would think received bar rescue consultation but the difference is...they didn't need it. Now...please keep up this momentum and consistency because we want to come back, bring friends, and jam with you again and again. I'm excited to try the scallops and brunch options! Thank you Rick and staff. You have built yourself a gem in Phoenix and we couldn't be happier to spread the word!"}
{"text":"Of course I had to come here - they serve sweetbreads, which I love and which seems to be tricky to find even with Phoenix's burgeoning food scene. Beautifully seared with cauliflower and capers, it was delectable. I paired that with a serrano strawberry-rita which was delicious and quite a generous pour. The ambiance is trendy without feeling intimidating, and the service is very friendly. Also, it's really nice to have an establishment where you can get fine drinks and good comestibles past midnight, like my friends and I did when we felt like having food and drinks at nearly 1 a.m. not long ago."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was pleasant, ambiance was nice, background noise was a little on the loud side. Hard tongue dinner conversation. A few more food options would be awesome, not a ton, just a few. Would love to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and what a surprise.I tried the Notorious B.I.G. Burger and it sure lived up to its name. 7\" tall and stuffed with a burger, cheese, shredded pork, slaw and pork rinds on a bun.  I had no idea how to tackle this so I pulled off the pork rinds and ate them as a side along with the fresh cut fries. The sandwich was an amazing mess and well worth the deconstruction and the required multiple napkins. For the fries they offered regular and curry catsup. The curry catsup was yummy, give it a try. If you are going to eat here and you are not 20 years old be ready for the background music.......Rap with a modern twist. That too surprised me but then again the side of the building is \"tagged\" with a Ghetto Boyz quote so I should have guessed that."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped in last night and fell in love! Service was great- Clayton was on top of everything and did a great job describing items on the menu. We sat on the patio and enjoyed their chop salad(so fresh and a perfect amount of ingredients), frites, warm olives, and the Salmon entree. Nice having a great new restaurant in the hood that is open late. We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Had to pop in for a quick survey of this new spot after dinner with the BFF.  We sat at the bar and ate mushrooms, which is really sexy. Just a plate of sautéed shrooms. Putting that vibe out.  No one approached.   That was okay, because I was there for the conversation and apparently, the mushrooms. For some reason, I decided to temporarily abstain from drinking in order to be healthy, which is how you end up at a bar eating mushrooms by themselves after you've already had dinner. I need to come back when I can have a drink. BUT if you are looking for a place to eat a small plate and catch up with a friend, Joe's Midnight Run can seriously help you out."}
{"text":"My daughter suggested Joe's for Mother's Day. They gave us a Gerber Daisy and gave me a glass of complimentary rosa. The food was delicious (pouting and Milanese). Nice ambience, great 80' so music and amazing drinks. And Susan provided wonderful service."}
{"text":"I wanted to check this place out because I am big into hip hop and from out of town. It's a great concept. You arrive and see a giant billboard that says \"If You Don't Know, Now You Know. We're open til 2 AM\". There are 80s and 90s rap music quotes on the brick wall of the building. Nice vibe.   We sat at the bar because we were meeting up with people who hadn't arrived yet. Ordered a mimosa. They use rosé in their mimosas so it tasted a little weird with the orange juice, but still good at $3 a pop. There was a TV playing The Goonies while old school hip hop played over the speakers. Really liked the atmosphere.   We ordered some fritas before we went to eat brunch with our friends. They come with three dipping sauces, and I enjoyed each of them.   When our friends arrived, we decided to sit out on the patio because we had five people, and there wasn't a big enough spot for us inside. Our waiter told us about all the various mimosas they have available. They don't just have orange juice like we were offered at the bar. They have strawberry, peach, cranberry, and a few others. I had two strawberry ones and a cranberry one. Strawberry is definitely worth getting.   We ended up moving inside because part of our party was in the sun, and it was hot. We were able to move inside easily. Our waiter was the same as from outside. He was friendly and helpful. He checked on us the right amount.   As for the food, all in our party thought it was just okay. I had the chicken and waffles. It's jerk chicken with a waffle and syrup. The waiter said that it was awesome, but to me it fell short. The chicken was pretty good. Probably not as jerk chicken as I had pictured, but that's probably a good thing for chicken and waffles. The waffles themselves were hard. I like my waffles to be soft. These were super hard, so I ate two of the four pieces. I didn't say anything about it because I was full anyway, but if I was still hungry I would have probably brought that up.   Overall, it was an enjoyable experience. I would have bumped it up a star if the food was less expensive or if it was better tasting for the price it's at now. Still, good little brunch spot."}
{"text":"Came for the first time for some restaurant week. Cute place, huge patio. 90's music playing and amazing food everywhere.  Started with the grilled artichokes which were perfectly cooked and the Frittes- the sauces were amazing but he manager made us a truffle aioli which was an unexpected treat!  For dinner we had the Notorious BIG burger which was medium perfect and fun. The Milanese's sandwich was fresh and full of flavor.  Dessert was the perfect ending!!   We will absolutely adventure back to try new items!"}
{"text":"We are from Albuquerque, and in search of food on a Saturday night, we had attempted and failed eating at four (yes four) establishments already. One turned out to be in a hospital, one had moved locations, one was unexpectedly closed, and one had an hour and 35 minute wait. We were exhausted, hangry, and desperate for anything that wasn't some chain we could get back at home. My husband found Joe's Midnight Run in our nearby radar. He said, \"Call them now, make sure they are a stand-alone restaurant, make sure they aren't a gay bar, make sure they're open, and make sure there's not a huge wait.\" The lovely hostess who answered the phone said there was a short wait, but she heard the panic in my voice and told us to head over. The valet parking was a little weird for us, but sure enough, once we walked in, there was a table waiting for us. Our waiter was clearly very busy, but also friendly, and the food was much better than we needed it to be in that moment, to be honest. The men had burgers, epic in size and juicy, my coworker thoroughly experienced and enjoyed her sweetbreads, and I ordered a chopped salad, expecting nothing of it, but it was truly one of the best salads I've ever had. The hip hop atmosphere was very cool; we were all jamming to the old school beats. It was honestly a godsend to find this place on what had been a long and not amazing day. We will definitely come back if we ever pass through again!"}
{"text":"Great patio birthday dinner. We had a get together, and asked for a \"sidecar\" drink. Normally, it's made with cognac, but we had it with whiskey, and it worked. Bartender worked with us, even though our server had never heard of the drink. Oh, delish! (lemon, orange syrup, cognac)...  The Skirt Steak Entranda (Sp?) is so good with the Chimmichurri. I would have liked some fresh cotija cheese on top, but it was cooked so well, it just melted in my mouth.  The chicken skewers-same-delish and cooked just right.  The dessert tart and the Smore were huge desserts. Enough for 4 but we managed! The music was just right, and we had a great meal and get together. Such a great place, Joe's..."}
{"text":"Very cool place.  I've been wanting to check it out for a while.  We sat at the bar behind the cooking area so we can watch while the cook the stuff.  We saw some neat stuff being made.  I had the mixed vegetables and the skirt steak with chimichurri  sauce.  My steak was delicious.  My husband had the tacos, they were very good.  He had a fun cocktail with his meal, I think it was called the Sunnyslope.  What was amazing was the dessert, the tart tatin  was so deliciously decadent.  I will have that dessert anytime."}
{"text":"I did not expect such a cute place! I think the name threw me off. I thought I was meeting my brother at a dive bar one night when he asked me to come out and join him and his girlfriend for dinner. Boy I was I wrong. I was pleasantly surprised when I pulled up and saw a large inviting patio that opened up to the open floor dinning room, bar and kitchen. And just to prove how much I did not know about this place, I was looking around at all the iconic rap icons and lyrics that were plastered on the walls, then exploring the menu and seeing things like the NOTORIOUS BIG BURGER looked up and said \"Ohhhh... I get it now!!\" Even though... ehhh... maybe I'm still a little confused about the concept. I still dig it.   The front desk, our server, and even the food runner were all top notch on the customer service. The Menu I found to be a little small for my liking. But still had a nice little selection of appetizers, salads, a few burgers/sandwiches, and full meals. After seeing the TOWERING BURGER walk past me and realizing it was the -  NOTORIOUS BIG BURGER (beef, braised pork, cheese & chicharrones)  I knew I had to have it. But first we tried the CANTINA POUTINE fresh chorizo gravy & mahon. Their version of Poutine was different but tasty. I don't know if it were something I would order again but it was fun to try. The Burger was also Fun and very tasty. I really enjoyed the crunch of the crispy pork rinds. The burger itself was juicy and perfectly cooked. The bun was fluffy and nicely browned on the bottom. My brother and his girlfriend were very please with their meals as well. We had a really nice time here and we all look forward to coming back and possibly trying out the brunch."}
{"text":"Is this the Real American Hero the cartoons have been singing about? Perhaps.  You'll spend about $15 on an entree and $9 on a cocktail, but for the quality you get, I'd say it's a fair trade. Joe's midnight run serves a tasty beverage, tasty food and they're open late too, 2 am to be exact. It's rare to find a place with a kitchen open past 11 pm and willing to serve something more exciting than bar nuts, french fries and onion rings.  Wander over to their website and check out their events. I just happened to be poking around and saw they serve the Notorious BIG burger and a beer on Mondays for $10, two wheel Tuesdays reserve a discount for showing up on your bicycle and happy hours that go to 6pm daily.  For all these reason Joe, you're MY American Hero. Joe's built a solid place to bring a date, a friend or run into some old acquaintances, really, just about any reason is a good reason to eat at Joe's.   Happy Yelping Phoenix, if you're out late and need a bite, Joe's just might be your hero!"}
{"text":"If I were to rate Joe's Midnight Run solely on food, I would give it 3 stars. However, this place overall is definitely a 4. I love that they are open until 2 am - it's the best place for late night munchies. The vibe is great, the servers are cool and the drinks are top notch. This place is perfect for either drinks with your friends or date night. They play cool music and the ambiance is spectacular. As far as food, I would get the frittes. The french fries with the garlic aoli is delicious. I've also had the arroz negro which I thought was just okay. For the \"Biggies\", I had the Pork Chop which was recommended to me by our server. It was good but take note, they cook it medium. I looked it up and I guess since it is a good cut of pork chop, it is safe to eat it medium. But still - I was uncomfortable eating the pink part of the pork. The server did warn me that that's how they cook it. I ate part of it, took it home and cooked the rest of it. It was delicious but not worth the $24.   Needless to say, we will be frequenting Joe's Midnight Run. I wouldn't go anywhere else for late night munchies."}
{"text":"We stopped by today after reading the article on this place in Phoenix Magazine. We were not disappointed at all. The vibe was great, nice patio. The drinks were amazing as well as the food. 5 stars all around. I will definitely be back. My Husband had the notorious big burger and I had the chiliquiles, both delicious."}
{"text":"Service needs a lot of work. Servers can't explain dishes properly. Also, when a customer doesn't like something it should be comped, especially when server recommended the dish or drink. Flank steak and foie gras dishes were good. I would go back for each of those. The other dishes were executed well, but not put together well by the chef. The scallops were cooked perfectly, but layered on lettuce tomato and bacon. A scallop BLT is not a good combination. Most of the combination in the dishes just didn't work [blacked eye peas, short ribs (crappy cut too), sweet breads, cauliflower]. The struffoli has a hard shell that doesn't hold the honey syrup making them rather bland. The ahi sandwich was lacking ahi. Drink menu was even worse. Drinks are overly sweet or lack balance. Very basic set of flavors with little depth."}
{"text":"This spot is fantastic!! The music is really good, I mean, they play Lost Boyz. For those who miss the good old days of real music, good drinks, food and ambiance, this is the place. Wish there was a Glendale location, Westgate?"}
{"text":"This place, is amazing. All the people with those horrible reviews, I would say you're too old and you don't belong there. The place is incredible. If you don't understand something, that's with your telephone is for Google it!  Love Joe's Midnight!!"}
{"text":"All the food I have had is excellent!  Pountine is amazing and so is the curried cauliflower  (and I'm not much of a fan of cauliflower).  The music is great, the movies on their tv's were cool and even the decor of pop nature was funny.  They even had a great way of delivering the check.  All these things made the experience wonderful and you can tell a lot of love and care is put into this place and the food.  Makes a huge difference."}
{"text":"Soon as I entered Joe's Midnight Run, I was drawn to the ambiance -- Love! El Rede Malbec was my choice of drink -- Yum. I started off with the Grilled Wings: a Chipotle/Honey glaze along with a lime cilantro dip. I shared the Milanesa sandwich: Beef, tomato, lettuce and fried egg. Didn't think this combo sounded attractive but it looks gorgeous and tasted AMAZING.   I would love to return when not rushed as to enjoy more choices on their menu. Service staff were friendly and professional. I would highly recommend this place. Cheers***"}
{"text":"Best place for some late night fun! I'm literally never disappointed. Cocktails and food always on point. Shout to Chris for always delivering such great service. Always going above and beyond! Definitely check this place out if you're ever in the area! Oh, they also play the best movies on their TV's. currently here watching Point Break (the original)."}
{"text":"Food is mostly very good, haven't had anything I didn't like.  It's a bit loud to sit with friends and talk, but outside of that it's a great happy hour/gathering place.  The wine, drink, and beer selection is great.  The patio is a huge plus too, can't wait for cooler weather!"}
{"text":"I love this place 100%. The people are good, the food is amazing and everything else in between is awesome. If you want good wings, a great burger, or awesome salads come here. Every experience is the BOMB!!! Thank you Joe's midnight run for providing a great experience every time!"}
{"text":"The keyword is run!!! The atmosphere is funky, and fun. They have 90's hip-hop bumping which made it lively and unique. I was solo (unfortunately) so I took up at the bar. I had just left the neighboring bar and needed to decompress from my horrific experience. I ordered up my cocktail and the bartender seemed confused on my order, which concerned me.  I watched her stumble around trying to make a simple cocktail. Hallelujah!! It arrived. Bless her soul. I was slightly hungry and took a glance at the menu. This is where my head started to spin. The menu did not match the environment the least bit. I'm listening to Tupac and looking at scallops for $14? It made zero sense to me. While I debated how adventurous I felt, I watched the couple next to me send their food back. Decision made. Cocktail and run. I didn't totally hate it. Just felt like they were trying too hard and their staff was inexperienced and lacked confidence. Based on the restaurants in the area, I give them credit for trying to be different. I'm worried it may be like jelly shoes and go out of style soon (and never return.)"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and unpretentious. My favorite place in Phoenix. Joe's has a great menu, drink list, and is a very nicely done place to eat, drink, meet friends, etc that retains the neighborhood bar feel while still being modern, clean, and progressive.   Seriously, I love it. Joe's didn't pay me, hell, they don't even know me. I came here because one of our biggest customers suggested it and we had a semi-celebratory meeting and they wanted to come here because they loved it - they have great taste. Trust me, come to Joe's. I will every time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I met my boy friend and his friends next door for a drink after work. After realizing valet was closed we were told that their keys  were relocated at joe's . We've always enjoyed coming to Joe's for cocktails and food. Upon arrival we were given drinks and talking  amongst ourselves. After a bit, a woman and her friends arrived and  harassed us regarding our conversation which was quietly kept between the 4 of us. We were questioned about our experience at other restaurants and also harassed about our stance on hunting which we were speaking about quietly. Once bothered, we were very respectful and conscience about our surroundings and beliefs on the subject. We were harassed to the point of cashing out our tab and leaving not only by fellow guests but by the bar tender. We will no longer visit or recommend this establishment to any one we know. We feel disrespected and unwelcome at Joe's."}
{"text":"Service: Our server was HANDS DOWN the greatest part of this Monday night visit. Matt has been with the company since inception and is adamant that he's from the non-Arcadia side of Arcadia. He was extremely knowledgeable and attentive and made our visit fun. Matt was always on time but never over the top. He was passionate and seems like a genuinely great person. Matt will be the reason for our return to Joe's Midnight Run.   Food: The smell of the food at Joe's Midnight Run will meet you in the parking lot. As soon as you open your door the aroma of slow cooked, cold smoked meats and Barbecue invites you in. The menu is two pages and very simple which leads me to believe that the head chef at this restaurant focuses on a quality product instead of options for everyone. Being that I have never been to Joe's, I was starving and I'm a glutton, the lady and I, started with a couple appetizers. I wanted the mussels pretty badly but since my future ex-wife is pregnant, I was FORBIDDEN to order them. We went back and forth for bit and settled on a side of Brussel sprouts and an order of the chipotle honey glazed wings. I did some Yelp research beforehand and everyone raves about how these wings are the bee's knees. Before we received our appetizer, we placed the order for our main dish. I ordered a frosty adult beverage and the Notorious B.I.G. burger (medium rare of coarse), the baby Nazi got herself some salmon. Our appetizers arrived shortly thereafter. Although the wings were fantastic, they didn't come with ranch (insert sad face) and were about the size of my wet-nap package. The Brussel sprouts were slightly over cooked and came out soggier than I would have preferred but still had good flavor. I'd say that the appetizer was a solid 7 out of 10. Our main dish came out perfectly timed and looked absolutely amazing. Unfortunately, and with great regret, I must say that both entrées were very underwhelming. The presentation of my B.I.G burger made my eyes and mouth water but their expectations were not met. My burger was cooked perfectly but was anything but interesting and her salmon was so undercooked that she lost her appetite and gagged a bit over the patio rail. I assumed baby mama was over reacting but I was met with the same response when I bit into her salmon. Quite unfortunate indeed.   Ambience/atmosphere: Joe's Midnight Run is aesthetically pleasing and well put together. This restaurant fits in perfectly with the surrounding restaurants in uptown Phoenix. The dining room is very modern and had me taking notes for my home décor. The patio is absolutely beautiful and showcases a fireplace at its center. The atmosphere is tailored to young professionals and jams old-school gangster rap after 9 pm. I can see me and the woman here for some cocktails once the bun comes out of the oven.   Pricing: Joe's Midnight Run is not over the top for the location and atmosphere. Id actually say that their menu is perfectly priced if not underpriced.   PS, Monday nights will get you a Notorious B.I.G. burger and a beer for 10 American Dollars. Pretty good deal in my opinion."}
{"text":"Let's First start out by saying the service was great and the atmosphere and ambiance was really enjoyable for me. I loved the call-back to the hallmarks of R&B music.   The drinks we had were fantastic. Their mixologist, bar tender, mage of crafts, wizard of libations, I would pay 3 times the wage that Joes is paying Him just to come to my home kitchen and serve me drinks.   But I just feel like Joes is still a young (opened in April 2016) and there were little oversights that a more tenured restaurant would have most likely have observed.   I ordered the Sweetbreads... and based on the three pieces that managed to make it on my plate, were really delicious. I just really feel like I got gypped out of sweetbreads.   And I love Bones, I love bone marrow (i'm  just gunna call it what it is, right now, Skelton butter) I'm more than willing to pay for a good plate of Bone Marrow. Unfortunately, what I got was a plate of Bone without the Marrow. Seriously, it looked great, but, the minuscule spoon full that I got only left a full plate of bread.   Surprisingly enough, the liver pate was great. Somebody definitely put a lot of love into it. It's surprising, because I don't like pate. It was very well-balanced with good seasoning. I think Joes is some of the best I've tried.   Now the wings. Let me preface this by saying, I survived Daddy Dukes Wing King Competition, so when I tell you they're  good you know that I know what I'm talking about.   Fuck me rotten, the wings were awesome. Holy hell. I would cover my wife in that sauce if I could get enough of it into the tub.   So really, I wanted to \"love\" Joes, but I remain hopeful, I wanna see them grow, and watch them cultivate their passion. I think they've got a great vision but they need a little more finishing school."}
{"text":"Great new hangout in Central Phoenix!  We stopped in after dinner at Fuego Bistro to enjoy a nice glass of wine.  The space is really lively, the staff is friendly and they have an extensive drink menu.  This could definitely be part of the rotation when looking for a cool place to hangout and have a nice drink."}
{"text":"Joe's Midnight Run has been an evolution of perfection from day one.  Joe's is a weekly stop for me and my 9yr old twin daughters.  Yes, that's right 9 years old!  And, no, they aren't ordering off the kids menu.   So why 5 stars?  1.The menu has changed from when they first opened.  But all changes for the better.  I didn't know that was even possible.  They have something for everyone's taste.  So even if you aren't into sweet breads or foie gras, that's ok, because you can have a Biggie burger, frittes, skirt steak, pork chop, mussels, etc.  ALL made deliciously and with much care and attention.   Not just anyone can cook on a wood fire grill.  It is an art form.    2.Not only is Joe's great for dinner, it is ALSO open for lunch AND for BRUNCH!!!  Yes, that's right, BRUNCH!!!  From classic like Egg Benedict and Chilaquiles to signature dishes like their banana French toast and shakshuka.  Again, something for everyone!  3.And last but definitely not least, is the music, the vibe.  It always puts me in a good mood.  The music makes me dance in my seat and sing along every time.  Those are just 3 reasons why I know Joe's is worth my 5 stars.  I look forward to the continued evolution of an already phenomenal restaurant!"}
{"text":"Good vibes, great service, yummy food. The roasted shrooms were awesome as was the Milanesa sandwich. Will be back for brunch."}
{"text":"I was excited about trying this place out! The four of us decided to sit at the bar the restaurant was empty..our bartender was very rude and unwelcoming! We will NEVER come back!  Make sense why there was no one in here!"}
{"text":"Interesting place.  Unfortunately,  I couldn't try their dinner menu.  Food flavor very good. Place is noisy. Slow service. I can't wait to try the full Dinner menu and see the restaurant flow."}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time amazing atmosphere fantastic menu great craft cocktails hands on owner Bob came over several times to make sure we were pleased and the bartender couldn't be more friendly neighborhood hidden gem"}
{"text":"Amazing! This is my 2nd time here and it's even better than my 1st. We came for weekend brunch, the menu is small but everything we are was wonderful. We had the smoked salmon plate, steak and eggs which was served with a wonderful chimichurri hollandaise sauce, and the flatbread. Apparently this changes daily, our shad a Romesco sauce, grilled peppers and corn, cheese and cilantro. Wow! Light, flavorful and different. It doesn't hurt that this place has serious style, the interior is very well done and I LOVE the 80s and 90s throwback music. I may just have found my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Pretentious. Not truly \"dog friendly\". Even if the food is above standard, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience for such a nice place! First off, food was way overpriced. I ordered the Ahi Tuna plate off the \"Biggie\" section and my plate was not even fit for being an appetizer. It was literally 5 pieces of tuna and itz and bitz of cut up pineapple and cucumbers. Presentation was nice but $18 for 5 thin slices of fish is insane and overpriced! I was left hungry and unfulfilled so I thought I will order a full Bibb Salad which was recommended by our waiter. He also asked if I wanted salmon or chicken and I thought it was included with the salad. No! It was $6 additional to salad. It would have been nice if he mention it. When the salad came 20minutes later, it was literally 5 leafs of romaine with cut up strawberries and walnuts. I was so disappointed that after two main course order I was still left really unfulfilled.  So after all that my bill came out to be $85.79 and I tipped 15$ in cash. That's a very expensive lunch for the sake that I end up leaving hungry and unsatisfied! Left so  unpleased but I was all like whatever and left it at that.  HERES THE ICING ON THE CAKE. A few days later, the restaurant withdrew an amount of $105.79 out of my account. Confused and furious, I called and talk to the manager who got my number down becus he couldn't find my transaction and said he was going to give me a call back but never did. I had to call back, at the point I was already irritated. It turned out our waiter(Randy) gave himself a $20 tip!!! What the heck. I have never had such a horrible experience. (Check your bank! If you wanna eat here) I really did try to love this place becus the vibe is right down my alley but really? What an inconvenience. I really wish they did something as simple as apologize for all of this but they were all really unsympathetic to their customers!   It is really nicely decor and I love the 90's feel, but they are trying too hard to make it upscale with their overpriced items and fancy stuff. We are not in Scottsdale. Focus more on your customer and satisfying them so they can keep bringing you business."}
{"text":"I thought this was upscale diner food? I was wrong. The 90's hip-hop concept lacks consistency. The menu does not reflect it. They need to simplify this menu with recognizable choices and bring these prices down a bit. The portions are very small and food was mediocre at best. I had a shrimp Caesar salad, side of frittes, and chicken wings so small, they looked like nuggets.. no kidding I couldn't even finish the food. The wing sauce was sour and every dipping sauce they have was mayonnaise based. I had to beg for a salt shaker to finish my salad. Disappointing to say the least. I won't be back until they revamp this menu. It had potential to be a hot spot, if the food was right."}
{"text":"Took girlfriends out for drinks and grubs and enjoyed every bit. Food, ambiance, music, and service all well done!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time. We went with a large group and sat on the patio. The atmosphere is awesome, very fun and perfect place to hang out. The menu, unfortunately, left a lot to be desired. I didn't think there was much that caught my eye. I did enjoy the burger but the ahi sandwich was not very good, I could hardly find the ahi amongst the huge bun. I wouldn't rule it out but I won't hurry back."}
{"text":"Exceptional service, Food, Drinks!  Cherish was our server and she was AMAZING! She assisted us with beer options and made amazing suggestions off the menu.  Joe's is now on the top of our lists for a afternoon or evening hangout."}
{"text":"Had our first meal here today.  The space is nice, service was good and the menu, Sunday Brunch, was interesting.  We looked at their regular menu and will return for sweetbreads, bone marrow and other interesting items.  Today we shared a small chopped salad and the salmon, he had beer and I had a good rose'.  Both were very good and I asked for the the salmon sauce recipe, with no success.  We sat inside, it was pretty crowded and when you add the excessively loud volume of music it was not a pleasant ambiance.  We sat next to each other and had to shout.    Next time we will sit outside to avoid the loud music, we come to eat and drink,  not for the music."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is amazing!!! Mussels, scallops, salmon, notorious BIG...everything!"}
{"text":"First time there tonight for dinner and we'll definitely return. Food and beverage were all top notch and the service was great. Catching up with an old friend so we stayed talking far after dinner was done but we felt very welcome and certainly not hurried to vacate our table.  In fact our waitress came over as she was leaving for the night to thank us again for coming in. Cool space with indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Had the short ribs, skirt steak and potatoes and octopi was exceptionally good flavor and cooked to perfection. The   was great because we utilized uber eats so it was delivered to our door by a friendly uber driver. Can't wait to head over to the physical location and check out the ambience there."}
{"text":"The restaurant was smaller than expected with a very nice atmosphere. We had the poutine and skirt steak apps. I would recommend going with the poutine. The Notorious BIG burger was very tasty as well. Loved the pork rinds on the burger. Definitely not out a bag."}
{"text":"Nice little spot, focused on hip hop culture as they stream the classics all day and night! Food isn't anything to rave over, but their Notorious BIG Burger was fantastic! Topped with pork rinds and pulled pork, it was my favorite of the few items we tried. Pork Chop was renowned by the server as the best they've had, and although it was good, it wasn't my favorite. Wings were good for apps, and their fries were great with their curry ketchup. It's definitely a good, being one of the few, late night spots in uptown Phoenix, serving food until 2am."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! The menu is nicely dialed in and balances portion/flavor elegantly. Can't complain about the price point either! Excellent beer selection and growlers to go! Come check 'em out!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I met a group of friends for lunch. I like to look at a restaurants menu online before hand so I have an idea of what to order. Their dinner menu is online but not their lunch menu which was disappointing. I had picked out what I was going to order but they weren't serving it. Their lunch menu is pretty small. What I had was delicious. The notorious big burger was cool to look at and tasted pretty good. Could have used a little more seasoning or salts. My friend ordered coffee and when it arrived it was so clear that it look like tea. She asked the waitress if she could brew her a stronger cup of coffee in the waitress said no because they would have to throw an entire pot of coffee away. In my opinion this is poor customer service. It was the kind of thing that would make me not want to return to the restaurant because quite frankly there are lots of dining options here in the valley.   Basically the food was good but the customer service needed some improvement."}
{"text":"Pretentious. Unfriendly. Slow. Wow it's been a long time since I went into a place where I was completely ignored. Walked out and will not be back. Too many other wonderful places close by with better service. Try MORO (close by) as they are amazing. Don't even even bother giving this place your hard earned money. So disappointed."}
{"text":"First I must say the place has a great vibe and the servicer was very nice. My friend ordered the burger and she really enjoyed it.  Now here is my complaint and reason for three stars.  I ordered the ahi.  It was in my opinion an appetizer portion.   Maybe 5 or 6 small slices of fish surrounded by some diced fruits and vegtables. It was $18.00.  I'm not a huge eater nor am I a cheapskate who does not understand food costs etc.  I had even asked the server to describe the dish a little bit before I ordered.  Please add something to the dish, move it to the appetizers or explain to people that it is a smaller portion.   I was still hungry when I left."}
{"text":"This place opened up down the street from me about a year ago. I knew they were good just from the sheer amount of business I was getting from them as a Lyft driver. I finally tried them for the first time tonight. Very friendly staff, exquisite food, and a wide selection of drinks gets this place 5/5."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and the wine and food were amazing! Randy was our server and he was super knowledgable in the food and wine it made it a great experience. Prices are very reasonable for such large portions as well.  Thanks for taking care of us Randy!!!  Love"}
{"text":"Welcoming and trendy come to mind when thinking of this place. Very friendly staff! Jeff and Cherish were great, and we definitely enjoyed our evening here. The wings, flatbread and burger were popular choices among the group. They have more fancy stuff, but we kept it simple for our first time here. Definitely a place to check out :) Thank you!"}
{"text":"My first time here. Loved it amazing burgers, great vibes,good music and customer service. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This food was amazing but I was especially amazed by our server Kaitlyn.  She was so sweet and wasn't to pushy.  She was A++.  Food was great indeed but Kaitlyn's service is what made our night!  Definitely ask to be seated in her section.  Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and the food is very good.  Great service each time seated at the bar.  We were going to sit outside on the patio on one visit, however the music was quite loud imho so we mosied to two seats at the bar.   Joe's has some tasty small plates to try different stuff all at the same time.  Very cool."}
{"text":"Food was alright, but way too expensive, and inexplicably late arriving as were the drinks... On a slow night. What my real issue is here is the pushy and pompous waiter we had. Some hipster with a superiority complex and an attitude, (younger fella with longer hair). Super pushy to the point you think they get paid commission. Ordered overpriced fries with their \"chorizo gravy\" which I'm pretty sure was Hormel chili out the can... Tasted that way anyway. Price point here is outrageous given their awful service and lackluster quality. Ambiance rocks, albeit I think B.I.G (whose picture is everywhere) would want his mug removed from the menu given this places lack of attention to the import of food and the service thereof.  Fire the wait staff, put down the can opener and bring your price point back down to the point of reason."}
{"text":"Great place to eat late. The food was delicious. And the staff was awesome. Enjoyed the music and the decor. Great place to hang with friends."}
{"text":"3 star food, 4.5 star service, 3.5 star drinks. Overall 4 because they are open till 2 AM ! Heck man, after 12 o'clock its 5 star errthang ! I really wasn't impressed by the food, but i only ate here once and that too I was hurried myself so its not that I sat there and savoured my meal. To be fair, that's pretty much always how i get to eat these days. The drinks weren't anything special, and the bar tenders did not suggest I try anything specific so i went with I an old fashioned which is hard to mess up. Everyone from the bartenders, the servers, and to the managers are all awesome. They are affable and welcoming and make you feel like you've been there several times. The food was just underwhelming. I will probably wind up going back and will update this if and when I do."}
{"text":"I flew in late into Phoenix and was not expecting any decent food places to be open but I was wrong. The place has a great atmosphere and 90's hip hop with a good chill vibe. I asked if they served dinner because a lot of places just serve drinks and have a bar menu. They told me the have a full menu till 2:00! I sat at the bar and saw an awesome grill. I looked at the menus and they had a lot of tapas type dishes so I ordered a few. I got the skirt steak, octopus and collie flower, the food was very flavorful but I found it to be over-season a bit. I would give them a 4.5 star if I could. The service was fantastic thought and just what you need at 12:00 am after a long flight. And for the  price? I never had such great food for such a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Excellent roasted chicken with spinach and fennel.  Love the patio here as it's nice and cool right now in January.  Great hip hop music as well, instead of typical \"restaurant\" music.  Though \"midnight run\" sounds like something you'd rush to and get it quick, the food here is not speedy or quick, it's delicious and made with time and effort."}
{"text":"12 friends of mine went out to celebrate a birthday and we picked Joes. I've been there a few times with my boyfriend for drinks which has always been great, but I have to say dinner and service were fabulous. They were super accommodating for our large crowd that comes witb a few picky eaters and they never let our drinks get empty.  So in kind we ensured they had a few pieces of homemade birthday cake as a just reward."}
{"text":"Walk in and Nas was playing.  Pee Wees Big Adventure was on the T.V. And the bar had seats.  The cocktail I had was a little bit on the sweet side my first time in so I stuck to beer.  The Notorious B.I.G. Burger lives up to its name, and was delicious. The  baked apple funnel cake desert, Tatin something, is unreal.  Seriously incredible.   The bartender was cute, knowledgeable, and a bit goofy.  She did everything right, including cater to my annoying need to plug my phone in, she actually suggested it.    Yeah I'm probably a regular now."}
{"text":"This place was an instant fave. Good food, good drinks, awesome music, and a great movie always on the tv's. Good wine for me and a 40 in a paper bag for boyfriend. A win for sure."}
{"text":"Was here for the opening.  I like the ambiance, the outside patio is set up nicely, when you walk in you see the open kitchen and the bar in the back. I choose bar like always but will sit along the kitchen side next time.    They have a great selection of beers, wines and cocktails to partake in. The menu is clever and unique and pairs wines with each item. Great call as most Arizona diners are learning to be a bit more progressive.    Tried out four items. I'm such a pig. A. Curried cauliflower, beautiful dish. Needed a tad bit of salt but the flavors were fantastic. B. Short rib steak - not my favorite. I usually prefer a slower cooked short rib that melts the fat and falls apart. This was a tad chewy and lackluster. C. Grilled octopus - I would pass on this. The size of the octopus was large and it was served with a couple fingerling potatoes. No real sauce and not very tender. D. DESSERT! - they have a pastry they cook in the brick oven. I am spacing on the name. But it's apple my delicious! I alone at the whole dish. It's definitely going to bring me back.  All in all a good visit for a first day. Some small kinks but everyone was friendly and helpful and made for a great lunch. Nice to have more restaurants popping up in uptown."}
{"text":"Pretty good! $8 cocktails are a bit overrated but not horrible. I'm going to give it a few more chances!"}
{"text":"The Waffles are amazing !!! The Steak is seasoned to perfection and I loved the ambience"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of this place. Loved it when they had their old scallop dish on the menu! Drinks are great, servise is too. On my recent visit I had a great time, however the curried cauliflower was completely burnt... and I mean the shallots and almonds and 75% of the cauliflower... I tried to enjoy it... I saw the couple next to me also leave off almost half of it. Hope this can change!"}
{"text":"I'd heard so much about this place before going, so perhaps my expectations were too high? The food was alright, the staff was okay, and atmosphere was pretty cool. Just not an incredible or memorable experience. Nothing I'd tell friends about, I guess."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I stopped in a few weeks ago after work on a Friday night.  The place was not very busy and we were greeted immediately by someone who seemed like a manager.  We were sort of a big group so they began putting a couple tables together for us on the patio where we asked to be sat.  Our server came over quickly to give us a run down on the beer list and make a few recommendations,  she even brought a sample of one of the draft beers we were curious about without us asking.  She was very knowledgeable and I really enjoyed the beer I landed on. There is also a nice selection od specialty cocktails and a full bar. We weren't super hungry but one of my coworkers ordered the short rib which we all snacked on. It was delicious!  Atmosphere was modern but casual with 90's movies playing on the surrounding TVs and some guests drinking the 32 oz bottles served in brown bags.  Overall I really enjoyed this place and can't wait till I come back to try more off the menu!"}
{"text":"Joe's was a very inviting night. It's got that independent cool kinda small feel to it. We walked in, and even pretty full the host gave us choices on where to sit. We opted for the bar to the open kitchen. Service was great from there, the waiter answering our questions, giving suggestions and bringing the drinks. All night it just seemed like they wanted you there, and appreciated it. R had the bone marrow app, which she loves and said it was great (for me, no thanks on bone marrow). I had the whole trout for $18. It was great. The waiter said some people complain it has no taste, and he's right. No spices, just lemon slices on the inside. If you like trout, get it. I'm drawing a total blank on what R got for dinner, but said it was delicious. I know, great review. Looking forward to going back, we had trouble deciding. The menu wasn't huge but a lot looked good. We were staring at the burger being made all night, looks amazing, be hungry when you order it."}
{"text":"Twice I've been here and I loved it both times.  With only my first encounter with the Notorious BIG burger, I was hooked. I don't care if it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner. I will ALWAYS get someone to order it so that if I don't order it myself I can still savor the bite of someone else's burger. The crunchiness of the chicharron, the tenderness of the pulled pork, and juiciness of the organic natural beef formed a trifecta of texture and flavors that unrelentingly left you wanting more. The problem was being able to finish it after eating an app plate of the poutine fries. Yes, perhaps it was not smart to order chorizo and cheese poutine fries prior to having a mondo sized burger but why try to make sense of these things?  The ahi tuna burger was fresh as expected and had great taste. It's definitely a viable option of meat is not your fare. I guess that day, my friend and I wanted to Surf and Turf our lunch so she ordered the ahi burger and I, the Notorious, and split them so we could have a half of each burger type. Notorious overshadowed ahi. No surprise there.   A couple weeks late, my hubs and I returned so he can try this place. We came in for brunch. I had no idea they were open for brunch so it was my pleasant surprise that we were able to spur of the moment. I had a Peruvian Sunrise cocktail which reminded me of a mix between a mimosa and Pisco sour - so light, refreshing, and a smidgen sweet, so enjoyable! I made Bry order the Notorious and I tried the shrimp and grits. Shrimp were small but tastes really good with grits. I do not enjoy grits much, but I really enjoyed these grits and would definitely order again. I didn't learn from my mistake last time and begged them to make poutine fries even though they typically don't serve them until lunch. Our server Clayton was so kind to make it happen and voilá! Poutine fries again!!! Happy tummies resulted from this second encounter!  Two for two with my experiences at Joe's Midnight Run! No doubt, we shall be back here!!"}
{"text":"Had an early dinner here and opted for the patio even though it was a relatively chilly Saturday night in Phoenix.  We chose to sit next to the fire pit which kept us comfortable if not a bit too warm!  The important thing is that I never felt like I was right off of busy 7th street.  The music and patio design were effective in keeping the traffic noise at bay.  As for the food, the Liver Pate is one of the most memorable appetizers I've had in a long time.  Served with house pickles, grain mustard and blackberry jam, it's stands on it's own but becomes a whole new experience when you combine these flavors.  Would come back just for this plate and a beer.  My friend had the Milanesa sandwich and I opted for the Ahi Tuna.  No complaints about the food--it would qualify as good but not great, meaning that it wouldn't prevent me from recommending Joe's, but at the same time it's pretty standard sandwich fare.  A mix up in the kitchen meant our entrees were brought out before we had finished the liver pate, so that may have something to do with the overall impression.    The service was good from start to finish--and this includes all the staff. The hostess was friendly, the manager at the door was attentive, and the man busing the table was polite and never intrusive.  Our server was jovial, prompt and knowledgeable.   Overall a pleasant experience and a nice night out."}
{"text":"I don't live in Phoenix. I come here for business about twice a year and I come to Joe's Midnight Run every time. Why? Because it fuckin' kills every time I go. Great vibe, amazing food, great drinks and wine.  I get the grilled octopus, some steak and some wine and just enjoy the atmosphere and the KILLER music playlist. Like the most legit playlist. Nas, Blackstar, old school hip hop. EPIC.  It's a gem. Check it out. You'll have an amazing time."}
{"text":"Very great food and great Vibe! They lost a star because of the parking was a hassle Friday night. I believe having valet is not necessary. I know they want the extra dollar but it's such a small area it's not necessary."}
{"text":"Awesome service, great food, delicious wine all for a reasonable price. Can't beat it. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Joes is a good spot for a bite and a drink. The concept is really cool being that it's in the old liquor store. Food is good but the menu is a bit limited. I recommend coming in for brunch and trying the mimosa flight. Great for patio events, as I have been to a few gatherings here. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had the chicken and waffles and poutine typed with egg, delish! Great selection of beer. Will definitely be back. La Donna was a great waitress, entire staff was welcoming and so nice."}
{"text":"Loved the music and vibe! Grilled octopus was delicious, definitely coming back and the staff was great!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend to Joe's and we left full and happy. I had a burger with cheese, chicharones and Cole slaw on it. Delicious!! We ended with the tart for dessert which was my favorite thing ever. The crust was buttery and the sugar caramelized. Seriously a must try. The menu isn't overwhelming but has variety so that anyone could find a good option.  The service was spot on, the décor is gum and hip while being welcoming and comfortable. There is a dog friendly patio that is spacious and would be great for sunset cocktails. Please try of parking for cars and bikes too. Loving this locally owned spot. So fun and a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Amazing spot for late night food.  Throw back hip hop, sweet decor and amazing staff.  Christopher, our server, was the bomb. . Skirt steak and burger was on point.. Good selection of drinks, excellent experience."}
{"text":"Came near midnight with my brother. The waiter was really friendly and would check in regularly. Shared the poutine fries and korean ribs and they really great. The drinks were a bit interesting but you can't beat that price. I left my credit card there and I was happy to see they had get the manager to open the safe. I appreciate their concern for customer's safety. Would definitely come back for a late night drinks."}
{"text":"Would have probably given 2 stars but first time there.  Almost no one was in the place for Happy Hour.  Food was really different, not bad per se just weird mix.  One of our guest had to return wine because it had a vinegar smell to it.  I would do drinks here again to see, but probably not eat."}
{"text":"I love this place. I went there last night for the first time to try it with some friends. We enjoyed: our time there, our drinks, the food and the atmosphere. I had the Notorious B.I.G burger and it was delicious! Must try it! For drinks I tried the crazy, sexy, coconut and the chunk. The chunk was my favorite of the two. I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Sweet vibe for a old school hip hop junkie, excellent choice in decor, the vibe is laid back & the notorious b.i.g burger is AMAZING. (Just make sure you add a egg to it) if you go on Monday you can get a select beer & the notorious b.i.g burger for $10 #mofomonday"}
{"text":"Hanging out with a friend at Joe's Midnight Run. The food, music (R&B) and ambiance is on point here. I had the flatbread with chicken...yummy!!!! Also I found out all the owners are from The Chicago. As a matter of fact 1 is from Homewood, IL ;-). Near where I grew up. Geez I meet so MANY Chicagoians here in AZ. The Midwest meets AZ! Yeah!"}
{"text":"Was out in Phoenix visiting friends and family and went to Joe's. The place is fresh (it has a 90's theme that had me reliving the glory days)! Hip Hop plays over the speakers - and its the good stuff; mostly before the gangsta rap. Which was cool because we were with my 3 year old. She had as much fun as we did. We sat on the back patio. I had some amazing wine, and great food to compliment it. I think we ordered nearly everything on the menu. The roasted veggies were grilled to perfection (you gotta see the grill to believe it). The frittes (French fries) were as good, if not better than the frittes I had in Amsterdam. We shared the steak, the wings, the scallops, the short ribs - all 5/5.  The food was eclectic, meticulously prepared, and delicious! Everyone at the table raved about the pork chop and my friend got the Notorious B.I.G burger - insane. I don't know what they put in their food, but it's like crack from the 90's. I'm glad I live in LA or I'd be there every chance I got - drinking a 40, listening to EPMD, eating Cornish hen and Bone marrow. Yes, they sell 40's (in a brown paper bag). Totally works with the theme, but not a real good reflection of the place - Joe's has casual sophistication with zero pretention. And yes they do serve Bone marrow (and Foie Gras, and mussels, and scallops)! I felt appropriately dressed and I was fly. Everything in the place is brand new and the staff - oh, did I mention the staff. The nicest servers - and they know their wine too. I'm almost certain we'll go back next time we're in Phoenix. Truly as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Waited 15 mins for my cocktail... Asked how long on the food , and waited... Waited...waited for someone to tell us..and after 10/ mins ...we left. At 1240 am... Who wants to wait 15 mins for a drink/  35 mins to eat ? Just bad.  Never again."}
{"text":"What a fabulous place for a late night dinner!!! By the look from the outside, I did not expect it to be such a cute setup on the inside. The place has such a great atmosphere with music  from the 90's playing. It has a great patio seating area as well.   Our waiter Clayton was the best. He was so friendly and helpful. He made sure that our car was parked at the right place to avoid towing issues. He helped me gather up my belongings that fell out of my purse. He suggested trying one of the chef's special steak sauces for our steaks since they dont offer A1 sauce there.     The food was delicious!!! I enjoyed every dish we've ordered. Though the bone marrow dish was too small of a portion, I wish there was a little more marrow in it. The steaks we cooked to perfection. I like my steak nice and juicy and still rare on the inside and it was delivered to me exactly the way I'd asked for.    Overall this is such a great place for a nice dinner with wonderful music and friendly servers. They open late which is the best since there are not many places like this that stays open later than 10pm. It is a little far for me since I live in Goodyear, but I really don't mind driving because it worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Super fun place!! I love the food, drinks, and staff!!! The ribs are amazing!!! Great crowd!"}
{"text":"I had been hearing about this place for a while and finally decided to check it out. I went for happy hour with some girlfriends and ended up staying well past! The decor is hip and fresh and I just love the old school 80s/90s throwback feel in everything from the wall art to the music (explicit lyrics after 9pm!). I especially loved the TLC mural on the wall- fun fact: Crazy Sexy Cool was the first album I ever purchased! Joe's was formerly a liquor store for many years and the owners want to play homage to it by offering 40 OZ bottles of Bud Light and King Cobra which I think is great. On to the rest of the evening- the whiskey sour shandy was recommended to me and it was to die for! Not too sweet or sour, but perfectly tart and delicious; pretty dangerous if consumed in high quantities I might add! ;) My dining companion ordered the French 75 which was great as well, I'm so happy I have friends that share their liquor with me! For food we got the grilled pulpo- and oh my god it was so delicious! Perfectly seasoned and not too chewy, I seriously could have eaten ten more orders it was that good. We also got to try the bone marrow and it was one of the most flavorful things I've had in a while! Of course I followed it with the infamous marrow luge. For those who don't know the tradition, the marrow luge involves taking a shot of bourbon and using the inside of the bone as a luge to drink the shot. The combination of flavors from the oil, fat, and alcohol makes for one incredible experience! And it's a good conversation starter! On top of the food and drink, the service was also excellent, not like the \"hipster service\" I have come to expect in the area. Our server was attentive, explained the menu well, and made great recommendations- I can''t wait to be back and bring some more friends!"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, service(server was Clayton) music, crowd, ambiance! I love Joe's Midnight Run. Had two orders of fries(because it was that good) ,chicken skewers, fish tacos (loved them) and cocktails. Chicken skewers were not good, boring, no taste, wouldn't recommend. Sauce was not good as well. But overall still 5 stars for me. Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Super cute place, they play 90s music. The food and drinks are amazing. If you get a chance definitely try the apple tart dessert. Delicious"}
{"text":"The food here is really good, service is top notch and the atmosphere is best of all. Great 90's Hip Hop music in the background (not too loud) nice patio. Only thing is the menu is a bit limited. I would like to see more options that are not seafood.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on 05/29. Service was great and the Bloody Mary (mix mad in house) was very good. That's why it gets 3 stars. Food alone was two stars. Steak and eggs was just okay. The smoked trout was served cold, but was good in its own right. I just felt the filet was small and it is served with a simple spinach salad. We weren't impressed with the brunch food but I think this place may have potential for meals later in the day. For brunch, I would suggest going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went to this place because of the great Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint!! LOVED this place. My dad and brother joined me and we all got separate things, each were delicious!!! Right when you step in the door you're treated with the utmost respect and care and it only got better from there. The entire experience, food, customer service, vibe of the restaurant, and parking are all fantastic. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, was not thrilled with the menu.... second time, I paid more attention and realized that they put a lot of pride in what they serve....  The service is genuine and friendly.  It's nice to have a late night place to go where you are welcome!"}
{"text":"I was in last night and overall had a good time.  They were pretty busy and we sat at the bar looking into the grill area.  They cook a lot of their food over charcoal or in a wood-fired oven and it was fun to watch.  Things started a little shaky.  I ordered a Big Daddy IPA and the server came back saying they were out.  I ordered a Colorado Vixnu and he came back a second time and told me they were out.  I settled for my third choice which was a Goose Island IPA.  We ordered three appetizers which were the mussels, frites and chimichurri skirt steak.  The mussels were cooked perfectly in a delicious broth and came with toasted bread for dipping.  The three sauces that came with the fries were distinctive and very good as well.  My favorite was the medium rare skirt steak.  For dessert we had the carmelized bananas.  It was kind of like a bananas foster without the flames and had a big scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Overall it was a nice place and I look forward to coming back.  Hopefully, I'll get to experience my first or second beer choice upon my return!"}
{"text":"It was almost 2am and I hadn't eaten dinner so I was very hungry. This place was nearby and decided to give it a try. There's quite a bit of parking in back with a few spots in front. It's next to the Flower Shop off the street.   The interior is dimly lit giving it a intimate feeling with TV and music. There's outside patio spacing for smoking, hanging out, eating, etc. There's bike parking. There's a bar area. I sat in the bar spacing in front of the grill. The staff was very friendly, esp. the cooking staff.   I had the skirt steak and blistered shishitos. The steak was very good with chimichurri sauce with the taste a little more exotic than a pesto. The blistered shishitos were very good with creamy aioli.   Pricing was very reasonable and I was full. Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is nice. I like the music and it's very very crowded with a diverse crowd. Parking is tough. The parking lot is shared with another popular place next door. The menu items are very unique - to me anyhow. I had the chicken Ceaser salad which was fabulous. My daughter had the notorious biggie burger which was heavenly! We had the apple dessert and it was worth every single bite. Loved it!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner and had am amazing meal. Super fun to sit at the bar and watch them prepare the food. The octopus dish was awesome. Also, they have a tarte tatin dessert that was out of this world."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, amazing both times, friendly service.  The food is out of this world and they have a great wine menu with a lot of unique reds."}
{"text":"Such a unique and great place. The owner is trying to create an atmosphere no one has experienced but everyone will love. The motto there is 80's 90's and fortys. It has a great music selection with throwback songs and movies playing constantly. You can also get 40 ounces of almost any beer on tap. They have even redesigned how we read menus, it takes getting used to but this unique place is a great spot for any night."}
{"text":"Another Friday Night First... we arrived around 745p. The place was jumpin and the vibe was an immediate hit with us. Old School hip hop playin and modern decor. Another great addition to the neighborhood. Things got even better as the night progressed.   The sevice was prefect. Our server Randy had a great personality as well as great menu advise. He made our night very enjoyable. 5 out of 5stars  The Food.. well we left not being able to eat another bite.  It was all soo good. We started with the curry cauliflower and marinated skirt steak w chimichurri. These apps were not only cheap in our opinions, but amazing. For entrées we went with the Notorious B.I.G. Burger and the gf got the Ahi tuna sandwich. We also enjoy these.  You will find a large selection of beers and wine as well as specialty drinks. We enjoyed quite a few..lol  We will be back many more time. We love the wood fire grill and keep up the great service!"}
{"text":"Incredible from the first sip to the last bite. I went with a couple of Sunny Slope Iced Teas where there is a bevy of boozes deliciously combined into a glass. Hubby had a couple of 40's and we shared a poutine w/ skirt steak and a Notorious B.I.G. burger. The old school music was excellent. 100% chance of return."}
{"text":"Had intended for quite a while to try Joe's because we walk by on the way to Otro Cafe (one of our favorites for pancakes and chilaquiiles). Joe's drew us in by the comfortable modern/industrial atmosphere with tons of counter and bar seating everywhere, music,and patio dining. Very open kitchen to see the cooks in action. This place has a pretty cool layout.  Sat at the bar for Sunday brunch (Father's day). No wait. Coffee was fine. It was bustling but not quite a sold-out house. Bartender and everyone was nice but wait staff seemed pretty stressed with the volume of business and didn't really engage other than to get a quick order and refill coffee and waters. Had a frittata and pancake. Frittata was way overcooked and dry.  Normally would have sent it back but one of us needed to get some protein asap to avoid a headache and nausea (she hadn't eaten anything that morning).   Pancake was very thick, \"cakey\" texture . . .  interesting and unique. If I had it again, I would want to special-order the pancake with fresh fruit or some other toppings. Otherwise, really prefer the flavor of my other go-to pancake places in the neighborhood..   Bartender did a courtesy check once to see if everything was ok but did so in the middle of pouring a drink for someone and was in a rush. Felt like an imposition in that moment to send it back and that was my mistake. Anyway, the frittata was almost gone by then so we didn't send it back.   We thought about talking to manager after dinner about the eggs just to give him a heads-up but he was busy waiting tables. Hostess knew something was up and we'd like to talk to him but didn't  interrupt his work so we missed our opportunity to share.   It's a local joint so I may give it another shot sometime down the road for dinner but can't recommend breakfast dining here."}
{"text":"I don't even know why it took me soo long to even know about Joe's Midnight Run when clearly my friends knew and were holding out!  I 1st happened upon Joes by attending a private party and got to met the owner Bob, and Chef Michael, both gave a little history of the place, it used to be a drive thru liquor store back in the day, found that kind of neat and the kitchen does not cook with a range or stove, everything is cooked in a wood fire oven giving the dishes a flamed kissed flavor! That's pretty cool!  At this event I was able to try the Moroccan spiced chicken skewers with cous cous with a mango yogurt dip which was completely delish! Can't wait to try that again! I also tried other items which after I went home made me want to come back quickly to Joe's to get more!  On my second trip I tried some curried cauliflower, the Notorious BIG Burger and the Tart Tatin (which was calling me by my name saying come back to Joes, you need me!!)  The curried cauliflower was seasoned and cooked perfectly and came with green currants, shallots and almonds, it's a great dish to share or devour by yourself!   the Notorious BIG Burger is a show stopper! It's beef, braised pork, coleslaw, cheeses and pork rinds on a delish bun and served with fries. This burger is amazing! So dang good and full of flavor! And the fries come with ketchup and a curry ketchup, and this curry ketchup takes your fries to another level of delish! The flavors!! So good!  Oh and that Tart Tatin, it's just sweet bliss! Its caramelized apples surrounded by puff pastry drizzled/swimming in caramel sauce topped with vanilla bean ice cream Truly the perfect dessert!   Both trips to Joes has been amazing and I am sure I will become a regular soon!"}
{"text":"Came here at a later evening after a ballet show.  I really like the environment, pretty trendy and the staff members were very friendly.  Ordered the Poutine Fries, Bone Marrow, and Skirt Steak.  Skirt Steak was okay, there was nothing too special about it.  However, the poutine fries and Bone Marrow was super delicious.  Would definitely recommend ordering the poutine fries. Overall, enjoyed the meal and the company. :)"}
{"text":"Went there with a few buddies on a Thursday afternoon.  Good atmosphere but a bit quiet, nice outdoor patio area and an open kitchen where you see the grills in action.  Got the skirt steak, poutine, bone marrow and wings to share.  All were good but the poutine was over salted was our only complaint.  Nothing that a 40oz beer could not wash down.  Did like the fact that you can get any beer in a 40oz bottle in a paper bag."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch this morning. The atmosphere was great, I loved the old school hip hop vibes. I had a couple mimosas - they tasted great and were reasonably priced. For my meal I got the french toast - omg it was amazing! They used some sort of coffee cake in place of regular bread which was so good. My boyfriend ordered biscuits with gravy which he enjoyed. The service was great. Overall a nice brunch spot, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's our first time here and the food is incredible! We had the grilled pulpo, scallops, and the notorious BIG hamburger. To say it was delicious is an understatement! The burger was grilled perfectly, the brisket was falling apart and chicharrones were on point! Our waiter was attentive and very helpful when deciding what wine would pair with our food. The vibe is just right with hip hop in the background! An overall great experience!"}
{"text":"If you are late night person, looking for somewhere to eat, relax and unwind this is THE spot.  Very cool scene, watch the chefs cooking your food on the wood fired grills and oven...watch an old movie while listening to old school rap...then steal your date's drink!  The food is great: octopus, shishito peppers, grilled wings are my favorite. The owner is so nice and friendly, service has always been great nice crew.  The patio is so cool, great for a group of party."}
{"text":"5 stars for originality, affordability and musical ability. This place is perfect for well versed O.G.'s who like their bone marrow with a side of Bone Thugs. Sophistication and street savvy play well together here without feeling like a gimmick and I believe that blend is what makes a business memorable.   I arrived on a busy Friday night, around 8:30. Both hostess and server were cool and genuinely friendly. I ordered the Shishito peppers to start, so delicious! The salmon is insane!!! Buttery and accompanied by sweet carrots and green onions.. no words do I have to describe them beyond YUM.. and very well priced at $14.   The only bad part of my experience was that I didn't think to order dessert! Can't wait to try that and brunch. Well done Joe's! We're rooting for you"}
{"text":"Had to go out to dinner and critique a restaurant for a school project tonight. So we chose Joe's Midnight Run. Let me tell you it was one of the best dining experiences of my life! The staff was incredibly helpful and actually took on the review I had to write as a nice little project for themselves! The waiter got the Exec Chefs opinion on a meal that would fit the criteria for my critique and recommended the Arroz Negro, it consisted of shrimp, Spanish chorizo, roasted corn, forbidden rice made in a saffron broth, and a pacquillo pepper sauce. It was a beautiful dish, and it didn't disappoint, it was fantastic! It also was really awesome that they had an open kitchen and they cooked everything with a wood burning grill. Fascinating to watch! Over the course of the meal we were also greeted by the owner of the restaurant who was very friendly and dove right in to helping me out with my review! To end the night the Executive chef came out and talked to us too! Needless to say, I was impressed by not only the service but the food was outstanding as well! I definitely look forward to going back for another meal!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and wine selection are great!  Overall, the food is really good but way too much salt.  Learned quickly to ask for my food not to be salted prior to cooking and that made a huge difference.  What I love the most about this place is that they are open late and their portion sizes for meals are just perfect.  Not too much and not too little. I also really love how the patio is pet friendly."}
{"text":"\"Biggie Biggie Biggie can't you see, sometimes your words just hypnotize me and I just love your flashy ways, guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid\"  If I was a restaurant, I would be Joe's Midnight Run all the way! Once I stepped foot, it just brought me back to my childhood days. Born in the 80's, growing up in the 90's with Back to the Future, Tony Toni Tone, Bobby Brown and the list goes on, I just couldn't help my excitement and me busting my sitting-down dance moves when I saw Back to the Future on a television playing on the corner and the 90's music bumpin like we in a house party.   We order the shishito peppers and the Notorious B.I.G. burger (how can you NOT order this?!) and both were the illest, what you talkin about Willis? Translation: It was so good, so order it! I loved the chicharones included in the burger - I grew up eating bags of chicharones like pringles!!!  And once we got our check, they gave it to us in a Garbage Pail Kids bill holder! It made me laugh!!! I used to collect those card stickers when I was a kid! Service wasn't bad and prices are reasonable - yea, Joe's Midnight Run is THE spot to go to for a fun, trendy, lively restaurant with quality food at reasonable prices!!  Thanks Joe for bringing me back in time..."}
{"text":"I have to say I was very excited about trying this place as I have heard great things! My friend and I went yesterday (Sunday) afternoon. We walked into the place and there were maybe 4 groups of people there. This came as a shock as this location in Phoenix is very popular to the brunch crew. I will highlight the attentive customer service and the music was great.    We received the brunch menu and there were minimal choices. I really wanted to be able to have a few small plates to share and enjoy. I ended up ordering the egg sandwich which was $14 dollars and my friend got the eggs Benedict. The eggs were not cooked at all and had to be sent back. The bread for both plates crumbled as you tried to eat it. They were gracious enough to cook another egg for her and remove it from the bill. She believes this may have caused some internal disagreement after returning home.   As we were paying the bill I noticed that the mimosas were $8 instead of $6. There might be an unclear print on the menu. We also noticed that there table next to us had ordered something that we did not see on the menu. It would have been nice to have the option to order off of the lunch menu.  I m going to give this place another try, hoping it's just a great place for lunch and dinner. Fingers crossed, and if it is I will change my review without a doubt!"}
{"text":"We ate here Friday night and shared the frittes and grilled cauliflower to start... The frittes were amazing!  Perfectly double fried just like they do in Belgium/France.  The cauliflower was really good too but my wife thought it to be slightly undercooked.  The Notorious B.I.G. Burger is like something out of a cartoon.... Pork rinds, pulled pork and a burger with cheese!  The flavors are awesome together!  They have a ton of beers on tap and a great wine selection not to mention the fantastic and unusual cocktails.  The staff is great,l and the topper was running into several of our friends from around the hood.  That alone made it feel homey right away.  Great new spot!!!"}
{"text":"Everything we tried was AMAZING. The Notorious BIG is possibly the best burger I've ever had. Creative and delicious drink, too."}
{"text":"Second time we have gone, first time we sat on the patio because it was way too loud inside. The food and drinks were good. The second time we again tried to sit on the patio and were told that it was usually reserved during happy hour so we ended up leaving. The inside is just way too loud to try and have a normal conversation."}
{"text":"Great late night dinner and drinks spot. Very clean and modern. Beautiful decor and wonderful patio. Food matches the decor, fresh and amazing. Had an excellent server who offer the perfect suggestions."}
{"text":"Loved this place, great service and really enjoyed the flat iron steak shared plate and the frites with 3 sauces for happy hour, wine was good and server had good recommendations. We also enjoyed watching other people order all kinds of shared dishes.  We sat on the patio and they had just put out some heaters so it was very comfortable. I will go again."}
{"text":"After some negotiation with the server about no iceberg lettuce for spinach,  I ordered  the ahi tuna sandwich.  My guy ordered nortorius BIG burger.  Burger was great. Tuna not so much. A chunk of tuna, not sliced as ago is normally served. Service was slow, there were a few tables occupied, but already eating. When our food arrived,  asked for ketchup and salt n pepper. Fries were hot but by the time the condiments arrived , fries weren't hot. Maybe because we only saw one server. Service should have been quicker and better."}
{"text":"Great new spot on 7th Street.  Fun atmosphere, and cool decor.  Music and videos are a throwback to the 80's!  My friend and I sat a the bar, watched and conversed with one of the chefs.  It was a fun night and the food was great, too.  We both ordered a couple of appetizers and then grilled romaine salads.  One with salmon and the other with skirt steak.  Both were delicious.  Welcome to the neighborhood...I Recommend this new local find."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Service was great, food was amazing, the whole place was intimate without being claustrophobic. My only issue is parking- it sucks. Valet was full when we showed up, so we ended up parking by the O'Reillys less than a block away.   We will come back here, just not during Friday-Sunday. They do have awesome happy hour deals and the music is killer anytime of the day- check this place out!"}
{"text":"One thing that I learned from my high school geometry class was the Venn diagram. You may remember it... a common area determined by overlapping circles. In real life, I've applied this principle in finding new resources:  medical personnel, contractors, and of course my favorite... chefs. The more people that mention the same name is usually a really good indicator of the quality of that person. In our case, that person is Chef Michael Goldsmith.  Peg and I checked this place out last night And really enjoy the entire package. Clayton was our server and took excellent care of us. When I get my relatively frequent craving for an extraordinary hamburger, I have just a few places in mind... and my list just expanded by one The Notorious BIG burger is as good as advertised with beef, braised pork, cheese, and chicharrones. Peggy had the fish tacos with ahi tuna and they were incredible. The pate was velvet and flavorful and chicken wings were tender very good . While we won't be making any runs at midnight... we definitely will be returning to this place.  Thank you Chef Michael!!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Me and my girlfriend went sat at the bar and enjoyed are ourselves. Good vibes."}
{"text":"This place was simply amazing my wife and I stopped in Mother's Day weekend and will definitely be back. She ordered the sunny slope ice tea and I had an old fashion but drinks with made with class and generous with the alcohol , the wings were insanely good ( be prepared to order them twice) anyways overall great place."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and food but parking is a joke. Half my party ended up having their vehicles towed.  Recommended by a friend.  I will not be going back because of it. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night around 11pm. The service was exceptional. The food was delicious. The drinks were complex and exciting. The music and choice of movie on the TV were right up our alley. It's really nice to have somewhere to eat for those of us that get off work late. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"THE late night spot in Phx for high quality American cuisine - lamb chops are the real superstar; the bone marrow will blow you away with flavor & simplicity; the pork chop was also a hit. Combine the impressive nocturnal menu with its chill ambience & very professional service- Joe's is the go-to spot for a civilized dining experience after 10pm. I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Swung by early while in town for work on a weekend.  Awesome atmosphere and some of the best breakfast food I have ever eaten.  I had the egg sandwich on Salmon cake, but everything else I saw come out of the kitchen looked amazing as well.  Salmon was cooked perfectly. Will be back next time I am in town, I would kill for a place like this where I live."}
{"text":"My go to hip-hop inspired drink location! Love the 90's hip hop theme, along with classic 90's movies playing on the TV's. Their brunch is pretty darn good too! I like the patio area with a fire pit. The cinnamon flavored toothpicks on the way out are a little cherry on top."}
{"text":"This place has a really cool vibe. The smores were delicious and the drinks are super strong :) And they serve food until 2 AM!"}
{"text":"Wow just wow.  Stopped here on a whim and wasn't disappointed one bit.  I had the ahi burger which was probably the best burger I have ever had in my entire life.  I have found my new go to place when I'm craving burgers. My hubby had the steak burger and he loved it as well. Sat outside both times we were there so far. A bit noisy from the road traffic but the fires pit is really cool. The service was pretty good but a little on the slow side. We kept seeing this mile high burger go by so we finally asked what it was. Turned out to be the Biggie burger (their not kidding on that). Looked amazing going to have to try it on our next visit. The background music really wasn't my taste but it was at tolerable level so I could over look that minor distraction."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the neighborhood. Cool vibe inside, friendly service, awesome 80s hip hop playing all night, large patio with a huge swamp cooler blowing for these hot nights! They're actually really committed to the 80s themes with your bill presented in a Garbage Pail Kids book, 'Summer School' playing on tv, and the wait staff in 80's ts and tanks. We only had drinks, but I liked the specialty menu, and they were pretty cheap at $8 per. My husband couldn't say no to a $5 Bud Light in a brown bag, either. Will definitely be back next time we're in town for drinks and maybe even food, too!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Took my very picky parents there while they were in town and everyone loved it! Its a good place for sharing, we went with a bunch of shorties and salad. The server was a little strange, but ehh provided entertainment while we ate. BONUS they are open late!"}
{"text":"Clayton was our server and he was excellent.  Polite, prompt,and engaging. Music is great food was awesome. Beer selection could be better.  Definitely recommend this place. 90's music 40oz and boones farm. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Came in with a friend for Happy Hour (half off all drinks on the menu) and was pleasant surprised by the decor. A little small but seems like a great date spot. Randy was our server and I will be coming back for dinner and asking for him for sure!"}
{"text":"So let me start by saying that I knew as a vegetarian I didn't have many options to choose from... that being said.  We were a group of 5 sat outside and we're having a good time having our cocktails and we were reviewing the menu- I found the scrapple- and read the menu thinking it had PORT as it was printed as such versus it actually saying PORK.. not an issue. We asked for further clarification- and we come to find out that it has pork and not port.. this wasn't the actual issue- the issue was the first person we approached they were quick to answer back and say \"no it says pork on the menu\" before even checking the menu... he takes my plate and doesn't suggest an alternative. So I'm sitting at the the table while the rest of our party has their food. Our actual server finally comes back after maybe 15 minutes after my plate was taken and as I begin to ask her if I made a mistake or what... and she leaves me mid sentence to run and get the menu to prove to me that the menu says \"pork\" instead of \"port\".... and by this point while 2 people are trying to prove to me that I read the menu wrong- they have yet to suggest anything.. by this point, Im over it and not really in the mood to even be in this restaurant. I would have happily ordered something else but when 2 people are trying to tell the whole table at this point that we are wrong- she should have gotten the manager to actually handle this situation a bit more smoothly. This being said this was my first experience at this god awful place. Would not recommended to anyone.   Who condones this type of behavior to customers? Not I."}
{"text":"Hmmmm. A tale of two cities.   Love the menu, love even more they serve till 2am. The roasted veggies were delicious. And the salmon was quite good.   The tag line for Joe's is \"80's, 90's and Forties\". Sounds good.  But the music playing was horrible. Not a song or two, 15 songs in a row and about as far from the Forties as it could be. Electronic crap.   I looked around the restaurant and at least half the diners present would have had nothing in common with this music. And, no matter what musical tastes one might have, how is electronic dance music appropriate for dinner!  The patio is fabulous. The dining room seemed sort of s hodgepodge, not eclectic good, just 3 - 4 styles jammed together.   Maybe some late night I'll stop back in but, H00-Fah!  That music!  No reason to rush back to be tortured."}
{"text":"This is my second review of Joe's Midnight Run, this time for brunch.  We absolutely loved Joe's for dinner, so we tried it for brunch today - and we loved it just as much.  This is a truly unique menu, with a great mix of classic and inventive dishes.  Same great beer and cocktail list, and same great atmosphere and service.  But the food is what makes this place great, and the five dishes we ordered were all winners.  The biscuits with a spicy chorizo gravy was amazing, and too big to finish.  Their burger is worth ordering just to take a picture.  It's covered with pork and slaw, and stacked with huge chicharrones on a spike, over a foot tall.  The scrapple was a really unique presentation of pulled pork, pressed with polenta and fried like a cake with a tomato-based sauce.  I had the spicy breakfast noodles, which were stir fried with sausage and served topped with 2 egg yolks that you break and mix with the noodles at presentation.  At the end o the meal, we had the monkey bread, which I consider to be a \"must order\".  Sticky, crispy, chewy, with caramel and pecans, topped with bacon.  Amazing.  I had a few Dragoon IPAs with brunch, and left very happy.  If you like great food, creative dishes and something generally different, this place is for you.  It's the coolest restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"First, I am in the over 50 range. We ate on the patio, the music playing was rap music, not my cup of tea when eating. It was noisy, but to be expected as happy hour was just over. We had the hamburger which was good and enough for two light eaters. I expected more beers to be offered and some of the dishes talked about on yelp are no longer available. The portions are big ."}
{"text":"Little place on 7th Street just north of Bethany home. Open until 2am, including food.   They have this \"little sandwich\" called The Notorious B.I.G.  It's once again, beyond savage. It's so savage, it must be said in a French accent: Sauvage!  It's a beef patty, pulled pork, cole slaw, american cheese and chicharrones.  It comes stacked super high due to the fried chicharrones.  You smash it down to a manageable side and get after it. No sauce. Doesn't need it. It has a richness, slight sweetness from the cole slaw, crunch obviously. This monster stays together surprisingly well. This sandwich, with fries and a beer is $10 on Mondays.  I've had their sweetbreads, wings, Milanese's sandwich.  Had the tart tatin for desert. Ridiculous.   Shawn (sp?) took care of us on Labor Day. I'm sure of this guy's mixology abilities. Wasn't happening with the Notorious + Beer deal.  Go in here and don't be an f'in square.  Just relax and chill."}
{"text":"I do have to preface this review and state that I am a fairly picky eater. But going to this fairly casual establishment, I figured I'd be fine... But no... I was overwhelmed. I felt SO uncultured. I had to Google basically every single menu item. I'm not exaggerating. Everything on the menu was something (or was topped with something) I've never heard of.   I was already feeling like I wasn't hip enough to be there, but now I truly felt like I didn't belong.   We decided to try a few things. The roasted vegetables, the skirt steak, and the grilled pulpa. We received our vegetables pretty fast. We were advised that the plates would come out as the were finished. (vague... Weird...) Those veggies were BOMB! Perfect comfort food. We took our time savoring the yumminess, and then waited quite a while for a RARE skirt steak. I can't eat meat that pink. I had Googled the sauce described on the menu. Smelled good... Wish I would have had some say on how the meat was cooked. But never fear... Grilled Pulpo was on its way. This dish was the only thing I hadn't Googled. The menu description just said potatoes, so lame-o uncultured me pictured some kind of potato dish. Ummm... After waiting several minutes for my \"potato dish\" a server walks out with a plate of freakin' OCTOPUS... aka Pulpo! It LITERALLY means octopus! I'm a fool!   I'm basically 8 years old and simply cannot deal. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his MASSIVE dinner while I sat reminiscing wistfully over the four pieces of roasted cauliflower and potatoes I devoured thirty + minutes ago while trying to avert my eyes from him eating TENTACLES!   Never ever would I had thought that the menu of such a light-hearted establishment would be so intense. The members of TLC were pictured just below the Bone Marrow \"shared plate\". This is coming from a fairly absurd individual, but doesn't that strike you as a bit comical? The movie Airplane! was playing over my head as I was Googling the word \"chimichurri\". They brought the check out in a copy of a hardback Garbage Pail Kids book and have you rate their service on a 5 point scale of \"dopeness\".   How dope were those sweetbreads, bruh?!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place for a late night meal. Fun vibes, dope music, and an interesting menu. I ordered the chicken wings, the bone marrow, and liver (interesting choices huh?) and it was delicious! I'm here visiting from Vegas so if anyone knows good food its me :) This place was definitely impressive"}
{"text":"Even though they offer late night eats till 2 am This place sets the standard in the area for their service. As if that wasn't enough they have an awesome 90s hip hop vibe and the food is off the chain.... the beer selection is solid as well with a legit selection of rotating taps. I'll be back and my friends will be sure to hear of this fabulous place."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are good and food has so many different flavors an was pleasantly surprised and the notorious big burger was awesome and drinks were awesome especially the sunny slope ice tea."}
{"text":"Bomb all around definitely worth the wait. The music playing in the background was a perfect touch #oldschoolhiphop"}
{"text":"Best spot for any occasion - workweek lunch, happy hour, or late night. I've done all three multiple times in the last two months. Shishito peppers and flatbreads never disappoint. The 90s R&B hip-hop  and streaming 80s movies are a bonus."}
{"text":"Honestly  not too sure how to rate this one....  Decor and music: 5 out of 5 stars. They did a really cool job on this restaurant.   Service: 3 stars. The server wasn't  terrible or memorable  but I think they were over staffed at the time we were there. The hostess seemed bored and just kinda stared at us the whole time. I don't think it was intended, just that she was  bored and We were in her sight line. But it was unnerving. Also we had an issue with the food and the manager stood with his back to our table and talked to us over his shoulder making jokes. Again, just weird.   Food: 2 out of 5 stars. My skirt steak app wasn't bad. Not great but not bad. But we also ordered the charcuterie tray, which had a hair on it. One of my biggest issues that no one can overcome, Is hair in my food. The manager, Who had very short slicked down hair, again standing with his back to us, joked that at least we knew it wasn't his.   I appreciate humor, but not about hair in my food. Sorry but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Just got back from our first experience at Joe's Midnight Run.   Pros:  exceptional service, nice atmosphere with many different areas sure to please an array of diners!  Well done!    Cons:  I feel like they are trying too hard with the menu. Odd combinations. I really wanted a quality burger. But did I want a burger with a quarter pound of wine braised pork and chicharonnes? No.  I ordered the skirt steak. It was very tasty. My husband had the wings and short ribs. The short ribs were not typical. A lot of bones. See picture.  Wings were good. Here is my big problem:  I ordered the Pulpo, which is listed on the menu as roasted potatoes with paprika and garlic. Thought it would be an excellent addition to my skirt steak. Did it say anything about grilled octopus??? No. I personally hate fish. My husband said it was good octopus, but I refrained from eating my octopus tainted potatoes. Something so polarizing should be listed on menu. I simply wouldn't have ordered.    I will go back, but I think that I'll be careful what I order or just go for a cocktail. Like I said, the service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Another great time at Joe's! Breakfast was delicious! Fresh squeezed OJ with Campo Viejo bubbly, so beautiful  Rick is a great sever, Ryan is the most welcoming GM and Chef Michael is always on point with his menu, what else can I say? Love this place."}
{"text":"To the point, great place and worth going to.  Korean Bbq Short Rib appetizer was delicious.  I will be back soon for those. The cook with fire, from wood!  So there is a little extra flavor and it hits perfectly on this dish.  I had the Notorious BIG burger and it was good.  Fries were good and definitely homemade. Wife had the trout and she wasn't crazy about it.   Personally I never had \"great\" trout anywhere. Great atmosphere,  it is a little loud in there but the food was good.   We will be back."}
{"text":"I love this spot from the moment I walked in. Escargo my cargo..  As soon as I walked in. If u don't know...now u know. They play hip hop here day n night. If you not down go somewhere else.  I stroll in Thursday night 8pm Phoenix time after my flight from Houston. Check the menu and wasn't really hungry   Yet... What's the seasonal double IPA?. Oh we got Bells hopslam from Michigan. So I'm a Midwest girl. They got Bells???!!!! I play it off cool. Yeah I will take that. 10% alcohol. Inside I'm dancing cause you know how I feel about beer right? Got Biggie in the background and on the menu. .. My bro get off work like where you at?? I'm at the midnight run and we coming back here like this weekend. He knows how I am so he agrees.     So we make it back Saturday afternoon for a late brunch. Very good french toast and bacon and of course I got me another Bell's Hopslam LOL. They still jamming Hip-Hop. A little more low-key during the day, no explicit lyrics , but I'm already in love. I will be back next time I come to AZ"}
{"text":"Great Bloody Mary which comes with a pork rind *heart smiles*. Had the spicy noodles with amazing ground pork and roasted garlic (nom nom). Egg told comes on top to mix around to make the sauce. I would highly recommended this dish! Tried the monkey bread which was good but the toppings were too sweet and sugary. Overall good service and the outdoor seating was nice with the misty sprinklers to keep the heat done."}
{"text":"Love the bone marrow and liver pate as starters. Good selection of wine to go with dishes, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Waiter was nice. Service was slow. Appetizers were a little on the pricy side for the super small amount you get."}
{"text":"Great place and ambiance.  Loved the food and the staff was amazing.  Ryan and everyone there made sure to follow up in regards to our meal and our service.  Recommend if you have never been here to check it out.  Well worth it."}
{"text":"Joe\"s midnight Run has a great story behind it and great potential I am sure, however as a first timer I would not rush back.  We chose to sit on the large patio at a table by their fire pit.  It was cold outside but witnessing five tall heaters we thought we would be comfortable.  The waitress and service was lack luster!! We constantly had to chase our gal down and ask to get our heaters lit.  The busboy would come and light one.... it would go out, chase down waitress again to get another heater that works, busboy would return roll one away, roll another in its place, light it and two minutes later it would go out. A mean game of \"Ground hog day\" four times later the bus boy has depleted his options and goes to get a cart filled with FULL propane.  In the meantime we are very cold and waiting what seems like forever to place our food and then to receive it.  The steak appetizer was extremely rare and very chewy, however the mussels were delicious in a great broth (not enough bread for dipping).  Due to our chose to sit outside (waiting on heaters) our food became very good quickly.  The visual ambiance is great! They have a large tv on the patio playing old movies (80's and 90's) with a great fire pit. However loud horrible rap (new and old)music blaring over top of you.  We stopped short with just appetizers and decided to leave.  Perhaps if you are a young hipster the place would be cool but I will not be racing back to their limited menu and slow /poor service.  Foot note..... the young generation seems to lack the true skill of being a great server! They seem to be slow, spacy and disengaged.  Sad really.... when you see so many amazing restaurants opening up!  P's. The busboy finally got our heater working!! fifth times a charm!"}
{"text":"Wonderful bartenders, delicious food, walking distance to our house. What more can you ask for? Try the burger, it's insanely gluttonous and delicious!"}
{"text":"The bf and I decided to check out Joes Midnight Run at midnight last night. We had already gone to a few other places and had to leave because they weren't serving food.   The bf suggested going here and I am so glad he did because everything there was absolutely wonderful. From the service,  the food, the atmosphere, the music, pulp fiction playing in the background. Everything was absolutely great. We did not have to wait for anything, the staff was on top of everything. The bf said it was high class gangster and I would completely agree,  awesome restaurant. We both got the classic all American burger hamburger and added cheese and bacon. Everything tasted great. Tried some different draft beers. I wish I had taken more pictures, too tired and super hungry. Even forgot to check in.  Definitely recommend Joe's Midnight Run for anyone looking for amazing food and service late night."}
{"text":"Super fun spot along the 'restaurant row' of 7th Street! The hip hop vibe and music is a fun scene and much welcomed! The food items on the menu are incredible, the octopus is simply the best I've ever had. The fish tacos with corn were outstanding as well! They feature some great brews and wines on tap, be sure to try a cocktail or two out as well! This place is open late which is great being in the industry! Can't wait to come back,."}
{"text":"I don't usually review before my food is out but I am feeling this place & the VIBE is AMAZING!!! Music is old school hip hop. Crowd energy is spot on! Customer service is a perfect 10. This is about to be a regular spot for me, I can already tell! Thank you Yelp - I love you! More after my food..."}
{"text":"I thought this was going to be a great new addition to the neighborhood. I was incredibly disappointed. My friend had the wings and I had the short ribs.   Both disappointed.  Mine was full of gristle and bone and she was very disappointed with hers. And sitting at the bar looking through a sneeze guard was not my idea of ambiance. My friends went the night before and said their drinks were strong and the night we were there they were very weak. So I guess I need to give the place another try since so many people are giving it high ratings but I think they need to really up their  game if they want to compete the better restaurants in this area."}
{"text":"I really, really want to like this place because I live within walking distance- but the food just isn't cutting it for me. I have tried this place three separate times, ( two times for food, once for drinks) and the food just isn't cutting it. The vibe/ music is so cool, I feel like they would be better off serving more of creative \" bar food\" vs high end dishes like octopus, etc. that just don't work. The concept is confusing. The drinks are good, however! But at this point, I would recommend having dinner first somewhere else."}
{"text":"While the ambience and service were great the food just wasn't good.  We had the shishitos-small peppers that were fine but nothing too special, skirt steak appetizer and the notorious BIG burger.  It was all just ok.  I would only go back again for a happy hour because the 40s were fab!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here two Sunday's ago in the morning for brunch with a group of four and found plenty of open tables on the patio and in the dining room. We were seated promptly and greeted right away. We started with an order of monkey break and a few cocktails. the monkey break is very sweet but super tasty. I ordered the chorizo and eggs which come with Schreiner's chorizo in link form, which was new for me but enjoyable. My fiance ordered the chicken and waffles, which is not on their online menu but is worth asking about. The chicken was glazed in almost like an Asian sauce and was very moist, he really enjoyed it. Our friends ordered the notorious big burger and biscuits and gravy. We found the biscuits to be very dry but the chorizo gravy was very good. My friend did not enjoy the big burger as much and found it to be very messy. Based on the service and location I think we will be back to explore more of their menu. The building itself is decorated in a hip hop hipster theme and is trendy without being uncomfortable."}
{"text":"First off the food is AMAZING!!! Best brunch in town. The grits are the bomb. Everything we ate was awsome. The drinks are so kool. Brass monkey!!! Who doesn't want a 40 oz in the afternoon. Best thing was the service.. RYAN is the BEST waiter Ive ever had. Definitely making this a regular stop.Thanks to Ryan!!!!"}
{"text":"\"Throw your hands in the air, if you'se a true playa\" Now I'm no playa but I'm throwing my hands in the air for Joe's! The service was outstanding, I feel like everyone in the restaurant helped us at some point. The atmosphere was nothing short of great, who doesn't like mid century modern mixed with hip hop decals? Plus, the music was on point. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because my husbands chicken Cesar salad was swimming in dressing. Although it was very tasty he had to wait longer to get another one which resulted him eating alone, and my daughter and I already devoured our food! Btw, I got the chicken and waffles and my daughter got the pancake. Both where so tasty and I loved the dry rub on the chicken (needed a little salt but was still super tasty)! We will come back again, but this time we will ask for the dressing on the side."}
{"text":"Really wanted to love this place. I do like it but they seem to have issues. Had early dinner here on a Saturday night. They were busy and the vibe felt good walking in. We opted to sit at the bar. Great bar stools and interesting cocktails. It's kinda hard to tell what is going on here. There were three people behind the bar and we are still not sure which was the actual bartender. Sitting at the bar was somewhat uncomfortable as there were at minimum three manger types hanging around staring at the patrons. Kinda uncomfortable. As for the food.., we shared a chopped salad. Great ingredients really fresh and tasty but there is no dressing on this chop salad at all. Needs work. Next we had the Tuna Plate and the Tuna Sandwich. The Tina Plate is very very good. High quality Tuna served with great veggies really good, a bit on the lite side FYI. The Tuna Sandwich was also very good and may I say it was accompanied by the best fries ever!!   All in all I would judge that this place has a bright future but is having growing pains. After all it's only 7 weeks old.  The staff to guest ratio was almost 1:1. Too many managers skulking about looking silly. Relax guys. I think everyone here is trying too hard and it shows!!"}
{"text":"We were referred to this restaurant by a friend of ours. I am so glad we stayed and waited the 20-30min wait. The patio was awesome at 730 despite the 102 degree heat. The misting system eventually had me a little wet, but it felt nice actually! There was 7 of us and we all had a few of their craft beers and cocktails. All of them were great! We especially liked the Belgian White on draft.   We ordered some of the starters, the frittes were tasty as well as some of the smaller treats. A friend and I split the beef cutlet sandwhich and the Notorious BIG Burger. It was very good! I shared the pork rinds since I don't like those all too much.   Great service and good atmosphere. Music was 70s 80s and 90s. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"AMAZING menu and food!!! The only thing that could have been better was the service. I came here with my parents one night after picking them up and they ordered coffee and my mom got her coffee before my father but the server told my mom she had to wait for her cream and sugar while he brewed a fresh pot. So by the time he got back with the cream and sugar her coffee was cold then she asked for a spoon which he never got. Eventually the GM saw how that my mom was using her knife to mix coffee and got her a spoon. Honestly the GM was the reason why this review is 4/5 stars and not less."}
{"text":"First time at new place in my neighborhood. Love the decor and 80s theme (was an 80s teenager). We had the scallops, frittes, mushrooms, and skirt steak.  All were well prepared, well presented, great portion size for sharing.   Delicious w lots of flavor.  The apple tart for dessert was huge and delicious.  Love the music and movies.  Good beer and wine selection. Excellent service, Susan (I believe that was her name) was witty and helpful with the menu.   Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, menu and service. The best of all worlds. We got the Mussles, Pulpo, grilled wings and skewers and everything was delicious. Service was on point. Server was proactive and checked on us without asking if we need anything after we just took a bite. We always appreciate the quiet proactive service! The only thing was that the bread seemed a little stale and hard his last time."}
{"text":"Food is sub par. Ordered a nortoious big burger. Pulled pork was dry and under seasoned. Patty was just as bland and the coleslaw was the same. Tried their recommended wing sauce which supposed to be to die for to dip the fries. It was a mixture of ketchup cocktail sauce and hot sauce. So it wasn't to die for. They don't have ranch cause they think their menu is too good to stand on its own. Honestly it is does not. Drink choices are standard but nothing to brag about. Honestly there are way better prices in the corredor.   The only things going for this place are the fries and the the 90s rap mush. The ladies I am with say the cooks are hot but the food is not."}
{"text":"Been here twice and each time was excellent.  Service is outstanding and Joes definitely has the gastropub feel and vibe going on with a unique 80s/90s twist.  They bring your check in these cool Vintage Cabbage Pack kid books.   High quality ingredients with great choices of local beers, craft beers, and unique cocktails.    It's great to sit at the kitchen counter and watch these amazing cooks do their magic. Don't be shy as everything on the menu looks delicious and I've tasted maybe half of it and have yet to be disappointed. And it's all cooked over a wood fire grill....It can get a bit crowded but that's to be expected when everything is executed so well.    Oh, and a special shout out to the Biggie Burger- you have a special place in my heart for life!!! ;) GET IT AND THANK ME LATER!!!   Easily a go to spot for me when in the area!!"}
{"text":"This place was ok but must mention a couple of strange ways they do business. The food and the service were good, but.... we called them to see if we could reserve a table for two, were told earliest was 7.30pm so we decided to just show up. Got there at 6.30 and it was practically empty, got a table right away! Head Office asked for the chicken and when she started digging into it we saw there was clearly an undercooked piece, we could tell even in the low light. Waitress called out the manager/owner who said he would replace it. He did not say he agreed with our opinion on the chicken. Got the bill and they showed the chicken was not charged but there was an added text to the bill that said against the chicken line \"Didn't like\". Clear misrepresentation. Don't think we will be going back, two dishonest statements in one restaurant In one visit!"}
{"text":"I went easy on my first time there and I was not dissapointed. The grilled Romaine was amazing and I had a bite of my friends BBQ pulled pork burger and was amazed!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and definitely not our last!  We shared the scrapple as an appetizer which was excellent.  Hubby had the burger and I had the ahi sandwich.  Both were very good.  There was just a tad too much salt on my sandwich and fries (but I'm not a big salt person).  The only other issue was my husband's burger was undercooked.  Ordered medium but came out medium rare.   We did really enjoy our food.  Cocktail service was pretty fast, water glasses were kept full, and the service was good."}
{"text":"It's Monday, 10:30am and I am already dreaming of going to Joe's for their Notorious BIG burger and a beer for $10 bucks. That is a smoking deal.  Joe's has a kick ass happy hour on food as well as drinks and they play banging hip hop music for the majority of the time.   Last time I was there I had the bone marrow that was like butta and the Cesar salad with big fresh anchovies and in house croutons. Can't wait to go back for brunch! This spot rocks."}
{"text":"All I can say is Fricking Amazing!!! We went for birthday dinner. Fois Gras cooked to perfection.  Short ribs tender an flavorful.  Bibb salad with chicken was fantastic, I've never had a more tender flavorful chicken breast.    Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Last night 05/20/17 Me and two friends came in to enjoy our night with some 90's hip hop and drinks  the waitress was the rudest waitress we have ever encountered first off someone in our party asked the waitress about the beer and she told him to read the menu. First off what if he truly couldn't read the waitress should know how to push their beer sales by knowing the menu. Not telling someone to read the menu. Then it took forever to get our order of drinks  like almost 20 minutes after that she never checked on us for another 20 minutes she tended to others skipped us stayed in the back finally we had to ask someone else to get our check then that took forever she just dropped it and went away. 15 minutes later she comes back at this point we're all irritated and ask for the manager from another waiter he told him then the manager just sat there looked at us several times even came around pushed in chairs never came to us we just at that point paid and left. Never again will we step foot in this place it was like we weren't apart of hipster crowed that was there and they ignored us for that. This was one of my friends first time coming and he will never come again. We all work in customer service and know how patrons should be treated and this establishment last night proved to us that people truly don't know the meaning of treating customers fairly and waitresses with attitudes should not be working in this industry this what makes establishments like this lose business. So this place will never get our business again and it's sad we liked this place the first time we came."}
{"text":"Cozy and spacious all at once; Midnight Joe's offers seating at the bar and grill as well as booths, open tables, and dog friendly patio. Craft beers, specialty drinks, and a decent wine selection compliment the well rounded menu."}
{"text":"Innovative and healthy menu...great and busy atmosphere...great service."}
{"text":"Small, nice atmosphere. The decor, music and tv was late 80's to 90's inspired. The bar staff was friendly and helpful, but did not hover. The food was fine, prices were ok. Overall, I enjoyed the experience and would return. UPDATE- I was overcharged and made the mistake of not keeping my receipt. The bar tender was to apply $20 cash and then charge the rest on my card. He kept the $20 cash, charged me the full price on the card and then got an additional 20% cash tip. It's ultimately my fault for not checking, but I will not return."}
{"text":"Good Food. Good People. Good Place. The chimichurri skirt steak was really flavorful and tender. The staff was friendly. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came tonight and did the restaurant week menu!! Amazing!!! The food is always top notch...and the service impeccable!  Great atmosphere and music! Movies on the TV with sub titles!!  It's a must if you want great food and they are open until 2 am!!   Our server Chris is fantastic. Made great suggestions and is so attentive! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise for brunch! Maybe one of the best brunches I've had in ages. Unique flavors and good service. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this rating 3 stars because I came here a month ago and had a 5 star experience and I went last night and left really bothered and upset with the experience.  My boyfriend and I shared the Belgian style frittes with the amazing dipping sauces, very happy. We both ordered the burger medium. After I couple bites of mine I commented on what a let down the burger was and how dry it was and difficult to swallow, he did not share the same sentiments and his was cooked to order and delicious. Realizing they had over cooked mine and he was having a much tastier meal than me I thought I would ask them to remake it. Boy I guess that was a mistake! The waiter came back about a dozen more times during our meal constantly bringing up how I had sent back my food, it was so patronizing and made me really uncomfortable and kept touching my shoulder as if consoling me. He could have just replaced the burger and not mentioned it again and I would have been happy. Instead he came back time after time \"are you okay?\" \"What a terrible horrible mistake we have made?\" \"The chef remade your burger especially for you this time, if you still don't like it I'll go back there and make it myself\" \"how could we have made such a truly horrible mistake\" and then he made a big fuss about how it would take extra time to get our bill because they were adjusting the price of mine, of which he took of $1.00 that he had charged up for a side salad instead of having frittes since we already had an order of those to start.  I didn't want to say anything again but the second burger was good but I had to pull out pieces of extremely thick inedible charred pulled pork, was this vengeance from the chef?   I had told all my friends how great this place was after my first visit... Now I'm afraid to go back and get stuck with this waiter who ruined my night."}
{"text":"Went for the first time recently for restaurant week. The food was incredible, loved the artichoke and scrapple! Cocktails are packed with flavor and not over priced. Sweet vibe and great service, it's going to be a regular stop."}
{"text":"Veg-friendly bites, cool cocktails, and gangsta rap make Joe's an eccentric, memorable outing.  The ambiance is casual-yet-classy, with either booth or bar seating. It's somewhat loud, but still great for bringing a group of four and chatting it up.   I really enjoyed the frites, which came with an assortment of delicious sauces the chefs are proud of. I hate ketchup, but the *curried* ketchup was outstanding! And while we're on the topic of curry, there's always the curried cauliflower app. Bring your herbivore friends to Joe's to start off your night and I don't think they can complain too much.   Of course, there are more rich options as well. Lots of twists on steak, and plenty of items featuring chimichurri...it's like a western European's take on Argentinian entrees. The signature item is a \"B.I.G.\" burger, yet another throwback to the 90s rap motif.   As cool as this is, I'm more excited for the drinks. When you're not getting a 40 oz. (YES, this is totally a thing you can order here), you can indulge in a modest, but delightful craft beer menu. On top of that are the *cocktails*. Designed by the mastermind behind my five-star review of Last Drop at the Hermosa (Travis Nass), these beverages are aiming to pack a tasty punch--at a single-digit price. And while not everything blew me away, I will say the Gin and Juice is choice. An absolute must. For the weaker among you, try the Sunnyslope Ice Tea. And like the rest of the service, these will fly out so fast as to appear effortless, all courtesy of a kind and fun staff.   Now that retro themes are at the cusp of syncing with my childhood memories, I'm starting to feel old. I can't tell you *that* much about the early-mid 90s, only that they were seemingly awesome, harmonious, and certainly much more fun than the late 2010s are shaping up to be. So whether you want to relive some memories or just have a blast with a style that isn't yet too big, Joe's is a solid spot for food, drinks, and fun."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place, and have been going since it opened.  However, lately its seems there have been changes, i.e revolving bartenders/staff.  Now just found out the original owner(Rick) has sold the restaurant.  I hope they can maintain the original connection the employees made with the guests and the overall ambiance of Joe's."}
{"text":"Went there after reading some good reviews on Yelp. After 9pm, they break out the explicit lyric music which is actually quite loud on the patio It's a nice place though a little too foo foo for me So we went to another place down the street. It could be a good place just not for me."}
{"text":"We met friends here for Happy Hour and were very pleased with the atmosphere, service, and the food and beverage selections!  Our Server was very attentive and familiar with the varietal menu.  I ordered the Cantina Poutine which everyone enjoyed sharing and they even featured my favorite Flagstaff Brewed IPA Mother Road's Tower Station on tap!  I would highly recommend this inviting and delicious establishment to anyone looking for exceptional food quality and excellent service!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I stopped in for a late night dinner yesterday night. When you walk into this restaurant you can tell a lot of thought was put into the decor. We sat at the bar facing the cooks watching the delicious looking entrees coming out of the kitchen. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive through out whole meal. We started off with the Cantina Poutine which was delicious. Shortly after we received the chopped salad with grilled chicken and hot wings. I must say all the food was on point. I can't wait to return and try the  $10.00 burger and beer Mondays."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast and super friendly service that was super knowledgeable about all the menu items drinks included.  Always have a blast and plays amazing 90s hip hop and r&b.  Our new \"spot\" for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered the Oven Roasted Foie Gras. This place is a complete rip off. For $29, I received a tiny piece of meat the size of a thumb! The meat wasn't even good. I initially thought that I had only received bread, as I couldn't see the meat (it was that small). If you're looking for a real dinner, look elsewhere. The portions are ridiculously tiny and expensive.It's actually pretty insulting! I wish I could give this place ZERO stars."}
{"text":"Cool, hip, funky, modern place that plays 90's R&B, Funk, Hip Hop and all around good head bobbin' jams.  Has a full bar and plenty of suds on tap.  Small plate place in which the three of us had - Curry Cauliflower (tasty), Mussels, Bone Marrow, Grilled Po Po...oops meant Grilled Palpo or Octupus (really good), and Duck Mole (3 tortillas come with the duck confit).  Has a parking lot in the back and a patio with gas fire pit."}
{"text":"No matter how busy or slow Joe's is, the food is always spot on. Love the mussels- can't beat them anywhere. Tons of garlic and delicious toasted bread on the side- so good!! The vibe is good and we live sitting at he bar watching the cooks do their magic!! This is a favorite local spot for us and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. My service was fantastic. My servers were so kind setting me next to the fire outside due to the cold weather. I had come here one night after work (working in the industry, I'm very happy myself that their are places like this around for us industry people say on a Thursday night?!) anyway I had intended to grab a drink and a couple small bites while being on the phone for a good hour, hour and a half. Now being on the phone throughout my whole dinner, my servers were so kind to me and being very helpful. So 5/5 for that. My cocktail was very very good. 5/5 for that I only wish I remembered the name. Next time I'll be sure to get it. Now the food was very good. I got the fries with aoli sauce and the roasted vegetables. A place open this late at night serving actually good food that you would want to purchase at a restaurant at a regular time makes this restaurant so appealing to me! I will 10/10 be back here!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit and I must say I was pleased overall. The staff is very nice and the atmosphere is full of energy, although it can be a bit loud and hard to have a conversation without having to raise your voice. The food was delicious! I got the beef burger with the shredded pork on top!! I love meat so it was perfect and the fries were nice and hot. My major complaint is that I'm a big chocolate dessert lover and so was my lunch date. Unfortunately there's NO chocolate cake, pie, torte or brownie on the menu, only variations of caramelized bananas with the exception of these deep fried mini puffs that come with a side of chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce that the manager suggested. It was okay but didn't hit the mark of what we were wanting."}
{"text":"This is an excellent neighborhood restaurant with a good vibe.   I had their salmon and scallop Rockefeller. It was delicious. Everything is cooked on an open wood grill. The flavors and the side dishes that they give you with their special sauce are delicious.   The open kitchen has a glass bar surrounding it. You can watch your food cook.   The outside patio has a fireplace and more of a casual atmosphere. I will certainly be going back in the future. I met the new owner Bob.   He is updating the menu and adding new dishes."}
{"text":"Friendly staff although one server very inexperienced. Wings tasted great, sangria good. Pork chop awesome however better with a mashed potato the sauce of apples scant and no flavor. The chicken Milanese dry . Fries great. S mores dessert had to try but was very hard and stale graham the manager replaced but second one just as bad. First time here but I'll try again"}
{"text":"Pass... was excited to try this place as a hip and fresh idea but what is on the menu on Yelp is outdated. Half the items (drinks included) are no longer on the menu and all have price increases. Food was eatable but could have made it better at home- save your money and try some of the other places close by with a consistent menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great atmosphere. By far my favorite place! I always order their mussels and I never am disappointed. Food tastes ni different than the very first time and it is guaranteed to leave a good impression. Staff is upbeat  yet relaxed. This can be a great place to share with a date over a candle lit dinner or a group of friends at the full bar. Outside seating is available with heaters for winter."}
{"text":"Serving great food until 2am. My husband had the pork chops and said they were delish. I wasn't super hungry so I got the flank steak and a side of veggies. I wasn't expecting much food because it was billed as a small plate but it was way more than I was expecting. The flank steak came with some small potatoes that were very good.   The restaurant was very open and the booths seemed like it might be a little crowded when filled but I was perfect late night."}
{"text":"It's a small place but they have good food. When it first opened, I was into grilled octopus and had to try it. It was good but thought it was a bit pricey. We were told to try their flat iron steak so we did. It was so juicy and tasty that we look foward to going there just for that. We also tried their pork chop. It was good but would have been better if it was cooked right the first time. They took it back, cooked it a longer and it got slightly dried but still good. Great service. Manager came by to make sure we were happy."}
{"text":"Nice new neighborhood bar. Love the atmosphere. Food was really good. The Chunk cocktail was outstanding. However...Beer selection is very underwhelming.  With 20 taps, how do you only have two local beers?? Very disappointing. With all the great local beers available it appears that the manager who put this list together didn't even try."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place so we headed over to Joe's.  My wife and I had the Notorious Big burger,  Chicken Skewers,  then topped it off with the caramelized apple tort.  The food was fantastic!  One of the best meals we've had in a long time.  Clayton and team took great care of us.  Highly recommend this for all looking for a great ambiance and food.  Go!"}
{"text":"Clayton our server was terrific! Although they don't have Jack Daniels Clayton worked with the bartender to find the perfect wine.  The atmosphere was cool and everyone seemed nice. I like the open kitchen concept.   The Whiskey Sour Shandy was awesome!   The Pork chop entree and octopus app were both amazing!  Definitely a place to go back to!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!! the food is beyond phenomenal and the ambiance is amazing. Old school 80's flicks on the tv's and old school hip hop over the speakers. The food isn't just random run of the mill diner food. it's actually very high end dishes that you would expect at boujee restaurants. It's a culinary experience big time! From brunch which consists of things like the most amazing french toast ever and excellent shrimp and grits to dinner time with some of the most amazing shared plates possible like pork belly and bone marrow your pallet will appreciate it.  I usually try to sit in Rick's section as he as an absolutely amazing server and always has the best suggestions for food and drinks, plus is just an amazing overall human being. The owner is also extremely nice and personable and always likes to check on people to make sure everything is good. Love this place and frequent it quite often!"}
{"text":"Joes Midnight Run is an 80's baby's spot to reminisce!  The sheer concept and ambiance of this restaurant is amazing.  I've actually been here twice.  The first time I've been was their grand opening, second time was to host my best friends birthday.    As soon as you walk in you are welcomed with 90's hiphop and r&b.  Those songs immediately brought me back to my childhood and put me in a great mood.  It was like the restaurant knew exactly what I loved to listen to. The bar tender handcrafts their drinks, making them live up to their name on the menu.  The menu was themed with musical artist (TLC & Biggie) listing appetizers as shorties and meals as biggies.  It is easy to see that the owners invested in the details in order to freeze the time of that era.  Not to mention that their chorizo fries were incredible and seemed never ended which satisfied my appetite.  Joes Midnight Run is a great place to come after a long days work, dinner date, boys/girls night out, or just plain ol' happy hour.  The customer service was awesome and you definitely won't be dissatisfied.  The garbage patch kids book was an instant memory and made me feel like a kid yet again!! My brother used to always have cinnamon toothpicks and on my way out they had a bowl filled with them.  I thought that was the cherry on top!   Instant top 5"}
{"text":"If you and your friends are looking for some decent food and live entertainment hit up your boys at Joe's. If we had left with food and an apology, this review would have never happened. The worst part of our experience was the manager and how he chose to \"handle\" the situation. We sat in a freezing booth, waited 15 mins to order an app through a different server, then about 20 later they arrived. Our server was confused and awkward the whole time. Also only saw him a couple times until we were handed off to a different server. She was the most professional out of all of the staff we interacted with. When my friends chicken came out undercooked, she took it back and the manager made brief contact about it being out soon. 20 minutes later, my friend asked for it to go from the manager directly and he somehow still couldn't get it done. We were there under 2 hours, had some Coca Cola and iced tea, ate some underwhelming appetizers, and still didn't leave with a to go salad for my girl. The manager refused to come by the table, was very aware of the current situation, and did nothing but cowardly stand on expo talking with his boys. I am appalled and have never seen a manager act like that when their guests are inconvenienced by the restaurants mistake. You lost me, Joe."}
{"text":"Fun restaurant, free kids breakfast on the weekends.   Food here is very good but not great.  Free kids meals is a plus although on the two occasions we used it we were charged and had to request it taken off.  I love how the music and movies they play are from 90's and 2000s - very nostalgic for my highschool/college days.  I can tell who their target audience is!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday (obviously) for the first time. I did not check out the menu ahead of time so my expectations were slightly different than reality. Based on the name, I was expecting a late night restaurant (which it is) that serves upscale (which it does), bar food (which it does NOT). Well, let me clarify. There are bar food-y items on the menu (chicken wings, flatbread, fries, poutine, etc.), but it's not a bar food restaurant, if that makes sense. If I'm going to eat at 1AM after a night out, I'm probably drunk and want nachos, rather than a pan seared trout. Now this isn't necessarily a complaint (I mean, I'm giving it 5 stars still!). Moving on, we walked in and were greeted and seated right away. Our server was great, very friendly and enthusiastic and already knowledgeable about the menu. We started with a bottle of sauv blanc and the short ribs. The short ribs were not what we were expecting, but should have. The suggested wine pairing is a Korean Viognier and its parinaded in a soy marinade and comes with fresh kimchi on the side. Should we have expected Korean style short ribs? Probably. Did we? No. They were good, but per that cut, a bit tough and fatty. The kimchi was more like a coleslaw than kimchi. And for $14 for two thin slices of short rib, seemed very overpriced. My sandwich had beef cutlet, a fried egg and french fries with it for the same price. I had the milanesa sandwich and my friend had the chopped salad with chicken. We both thoroughly enjoyed out entrees. Overall the food was really good, great atmosphere and service as well."}
{"text":"Beautiful eggs benedict! Perfect cocktails. Great service. What an asset to the 7th Street corridor. Joe's Midnight Run is one of our \"go to\" local favorites. The patio is a neat place to hang out and watch local traffic with a Mimosa on a leisurely weekend afternoon. Bring some friends and share the love!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Atmosphere and Great mix of people. Owner/ Manager is very friendly and is on top of customer service. The music is a bit loud in the morning. I had a hard time hearing the waiter and found myself talking with a raised voice. Seems like it would be a great place in the evening for a drink! I ordered the scallops which were perfectly cooked. The meal was flavorful  but the vegetables were saturated in oil and my dish was extremely salty. No one at our table ate the vegetables or potatoes because of the abundant oil. I sat on the booth side and the seat was so big I was slouching back and much lower then the chairs on the other side. Felt like they were looking down at us. The chairs were cool and went with the great decor  but uncomfortable according to my friends.  If you want a great place with a good vibe I highly recommend. I would not go for the food at this point. They are brand new and I suspect they will hammer out some of the kinks."}
{"text":"Great food, better service. Had the burger with the chiccarones and holy cow was it good. Taylee was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable,  I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Well, I gave this place 5 stars for the first 20 times I've been there. The ownership, prices,  and food has changed as well. There have been some nice new additions to the bar menu,( Crown Royal, Jack Daniels, Micholob Ultra,  etc), but also some steep price increases to things. The happy hour is more expensive then the old regular prices. I understand price increases and food costs but this restaurant is not in Scottsdale. ( 4 people for dinner and a couple cocktails each was over $300). Still love Joe's but will not be visiting them regularly as I did before.  For that kind of money I can spend an extra $100 and be at Durant's or Dominick's."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Really cool atmosphere, friendly service, and tasty food. We had the scallops, the shishitos, and then skirt steak. They were all excellent!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Joe's Midnight Run. I met a friend for happy hour on Friday night and we arrived long before it was busy. We sat at the bar, and bartender Angela was very attentive. I had a raspberry  cider on draft,  then switched to red wine. The happy hour deal makes half the wine list $6 a glass, and there is quite a nice selection. We also ordered several appetizers, starting with the Grilled artichoke then moving to the grilled honey Chipotle Wings and finished with the grilled Romaine salad.  The Grilled artichoke, while tasty, was extremely dry on the outside and pretty much inedible until you got almost to the heart. Tasty, but not the best value when you have to waste more than half. The wings were excellent: sticky-sweet with a slight burn. The grilled Romaine salad also was excellent, and they accommodated my request to put the bacon on the side so dining companion could eat it all and I would have none. It has roasted red peppers, tomatoes and a lemon buttermilk dressing which is quite tasty.  After the first glass of red, we switched to an Old Vine red, which was absolutely delicious. We thought we were ordering the Old Vine from the same $6 a glass side of the menu, but we didn't notice there was another Old Vine red and the bartender did not clarify which one we wanted. So, we were unknowingly charged $11 a piece for our last three glasses and somehow none of them received the happy hour discount. What a surprise on the bill! I am not accustomed to spending $85 on happy hour snacks and drinks for two, so be careful how you order!!  Also, because the menu is seasonal, you may find items for which you have seen pictures and descriptions on Yelp are no longer on the menu, and the menu on their website was not current either. I would like to go back and try some other dishes.   I am very pleased that they have numerous dishes that will accommodate gf dining."}
{"text":"I'm vacillating between a 2 and a 3 star review, right now.  My first time to Joe's was around 4:30 pm on a Tuesday a week ago.. Maybe that's why that visit was way better than the second.  The service and attention to detail was actually over the top, but then again, there were only four tables occupied on the patio, which made it a breeze to deliver really good service.  The music was good, I was greeted or checked on by three or four different employees, and they were all smiling and friendly.  We tried several beers and a cocktail, and we split the Frites (very good!!!).  I thought it was a cool place and invited an additional three friends to join me the next Friday.   The second visit was the complete opposite experience. This was last Friday at 5:30pm.  The female server outside simply could not keep up, and there should have been a manager or support staff to her rescue. It was so obvious that service was lacking.. Separate tables were engaging in conversation about the abysmal service.  People sat dazed , confused, and thirsty.   Our table service was slow, but the poor people arriving after us and sitting on either side of us had it even worse.  We estimated it took each table ten minutes to get their waters, and close to 20 minutes to get their first round of drinks.  There were young men/boys/employees in blue shirts wandering about the patio somewhat lacking purpose.. They should  be cross trained to help out the struggling server (or do something more than light tea candles and place menus on the table). Bring the waters! Clear some plates! Grab the dinner check or waitress or manager's attention when asked by the  guests..  We ordered several small plates and they were ok.. nothing amazing... It was really sad looking around the patio and seeing so many tables looking around , wondering when their service, drinks, and food would appear. We were prepared to ask for our check for some time but could not get our server's attention, so we asked one of the boys in blue to get our check for us and he said ok, walked away, never to return nor complete the request.   I shall apply the three strike rule to this place because I just cant decide... At that time I will update my review."}
{"text":"Holy Bloody Joe!! This place is a foodies, photographers and interior designers' playground! Hands down my new fave brunch spot. From sweet treats to savory dishes, Joe's Midnight Run had all my senses going!   We ordered up a couple of Bloody Joe's, the Shrimp & Grits, and the ever tasty Banana French Toast (Made with brioche)... yowzas! (Insert mind-blown Bitmoji here). The smokiness of the shrimp sprinkled with a love tap of sea salt makes me drool just thinking about it. Everything came out in a timely manner and the food quality was impeccable  Best part, Bloody Joe came with a side car... vroom, vroom!!   The skylight and natural light in this place makes every mobile phone shot seem pro. And the music at Joe's is motivation enough to keep me coming back. Love, peace, more bacon please!"}
{"text":"New place in town. Heard a lot of good things about place. Went for dinner with my husband and my BFF.  Made a very good decision to try it. Food is delicious. Service is superb. Better make a reservation though. Very popular place. Would come back for sure . Cuisine is very unique with a French twist."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and great management. Really dope conceptual food items. The vibes and music are great as well.  Really cool date spot or place for drinks with friends. Notorious Burger is great!"}
{"text":"This place has a super cool vibe. Very good music and the food I delicious! A little pricy but then it was excellent so it kind of evens out. I had the steak medium rare and oh my.  been here twice and will be back!"}
{"text":"Have you ever just gotten a good feeling about a restaurant? Even before you walk in? That's how Joe's Midnight Run felt, when we pulled up we knew something good was cooking because we could smell it and we could see it - the staff was hauling piles of wood to the kitchen with 90's hip hop music blasting and a huge pink \"Break dance\" sign at the entrance. While the kitchen does not have a smoker, it does have a wood stove and stacks on stacks of of mini cast irons piled high. We were SO excited to order. We came here for brunch and ordered the Chilaqueles and Notorious B.I.G. Burger. When our orders came out, both of our jaws dropped. The Notorious B.I.G. Burger is the most appropriate name for that burger-  HOLY MOLY the patty was a delicious concoction of beef and pork that mixed together with the coleslaw and chicharrones perfectly! And it was BIG. I'd never had Chilaqueles before, but it had nice Southwest flavors, too, and the steak paired well with the toasted tortillas and egg. And while the food kicked butt, so did the atmosphere. I couldn't help but sing/rap to hip hop songs playing on the speakers or watch Ace Ventura Pet Detective on the TV. Needless to say, I felt right at home. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We came for lunch and sat at the bar next to the kitchen. The chef introduced herself and proceeded to show us some of her favorite dishes. What a cool experience! Watching her create these works of art on plates was a lot of fun.  The staff were great, the prices were great, and the food was incredible. We had the shoshito peppers, frittes, chicken wings, and the short ribs. Everything was terrific! We can't wait to come back and try some more of the menu. The octopus and scallops for sure. This is going to be a great addition to the restaurants here in uptown! God I love living here!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Tried the poutine, and the Biggie burger both were Amazing. Apple pie tai was great, as was the Watermelon ale. I will be back to try desert.  The Sunday brunch sounds awesome."}
{"text":"If you're ever in Phoenix this place is a must. Aside from the fact that they play rap music with song lyrics super inappropriate for eating dinner with your parents their food is crazy amazing. I'm also kind of offended that they named this burger NOTORIOUS B.I.G. Only because I'm also a fat person. But whatevs it didn't deter me from ordering and or eating it. And yes that is CHICHARRONES, yeah, I know right?!"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place! The ambiance alone got us hooked. But the food is very good as well as the drink selection! Will come again.   Btw, we were visiting PHX from LA so it definitely made us feel at home"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great atmosphere, amazing food, and awesome alcoholic beverages. We ordered the grilled pulpo, heirloom tomato salad, scrapple and the tart tatini which were all incredibly amazing!!"}
{"text":"Service; so friendly and his recommendations were fabulous.   Food; We ordered the burger, which is enough for two.  It literally was topped with pulled pork and chicarones. Made to order was so yummy. Also got the chopped salad with chicken, the chicken is the best I've tasted.   Must try"}
{"text":"Shame on Joes for Valet only parking.  Last two times I tried to come here and about 10 cars were waiting for the Valet so they were blocking 1 of 2 north bound lanes on 7th!  How is this even legal!?  I guess they would rather have their precious valet parking than safety!"}
{"text":"Hands down best vibe in town.....the mod 90's hip hop music just makes you want to sing along the whole time you're here.....  Brother and I sat on the patio listening to Heavy D and watching The Matrix while sharing plates of bone marrow, grilled wings and Moroccan cauliflower - DELISH!!  Totally recommend going with the shared plates option for dinner - you can try more with friends.  Seriously.....best music vibe in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"This place just opened last week on Tuesday. Honey and I decided to break this joint in. Who doesn't want to eat and listen to Easy E, Tu Pac, Dre.. Then switch to guns and medal ..? love itttttt. The menu has biggie and the shorties on them. Ahha.  I love the set up in this place, open kitchen and bar, nice dim lighting, open patio with bistro lights and a fire place, candles on each table, candles on the walls, the quotes on the walls, loud music  This place just have a feel good vibe.  They didn't have a vegetarian entrée so I ordered sides. The shishitos, it was good. Either of us got the spicy one. Haha. Also the veggie flatbread and the roasted cauliflower. I didn't finish the roasted cauliflower because it was too salty for me.  My boyfriend got the B.I.G notorious Burger! He killed it!   This place opens til 2pm. Why not do a midnight run to Joe's place."}
{"text":"I've been to Joe's MR 3 times and each time I'm more impressed with their menu. Tonight, I had the fish tacos--they are by far the best fish tacos I have ever had. And the corn on the cob side was amazing (I'm not a corn on the cob fan). Just had to give this place 5 stars because food is exceptional, especially for the price. The background music makes your experience even better.  I could help but dance in my seat. I hope Joe's is around for a while."}
{"text":"Was great when they were open past midnight.  Now that they close at ten they are like many of the other average restaurants on 7th St."}
{"text":"Great experience at Joe's! I live nearby and I'm constantly stalking all the new restaurants opening up. Joe's did no disappoint and surpassed many new spots in the area. The service is top notch. The food is delicious and the drink menu is fantastic. Lots of beer, wine and cocktail options. Such a great vibe. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"So wanted to give 4 or 5 stars started out with awesome 90's soundtrack..  menu looked amazing but the two working the bar tonight did not have the guests or the owners interest in mind.  With constant flirting (female bartender was trying to focus on her guests) and lack of focus on the handful of people sitting at the bar was not good.  We will go back for a second chance so review may improve!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday and wow, loved the environment, love the food, drinks .. everything about this place is amazing, a must go if your looking for a hip place... plays 90s music, very retro.. Food was phenomenal, from the duck mole, to the pork chop... and if your in for a sweet treat try the s'mores and the puffies, amazing"}
{"text":"Cool little interesting place. I had a nice beer on tap which was good, and also tried an Old Fashion. No food as this was a drinking only excursion but next time! Music was cool and the vibe was alright. I also took a 40 to go. Oh yeah! Oh, and they sell Boone's. Whaaat?!!"}
{"text":"Clearly, this place has gotten better (hence the million check ins). Their brunch is legit. It may be one of the best in town. The biscuits and gravy are so rich and sinful (they make a southwest ish version.... it's great... you need it in your life)..... you can definitely share this dish. The benedict is awesome, and the eggs are always perfectly cooked. Their monkey bread is insane, but so sweet, it's hard to even eat them between two people... you need a group. Their french toast is delish and it comes with bacon.... so good! The last time I went, I had their spicy noodles with raw egg yolks for breakfast....this sounds so gross.....it was amazing! I'd highly recommend Joe's for brunch."}
{"text":"I have Joe's another try, well a few more times and they have worked out all the kinks and the food was delicious.  I love their lunch menu and sitting at the bar when Megan works. She is friendly without being annoying. Her excitement over the menu gets me excited to try everything. Chicken Curry sandwich and the chopped salad with salmon are my favorites."}
{"text":"Went here last night with the wife. We were both starving and decided to give this place a shot. That was our first mistake. we were able to get a couple seats at the bar which I highly recommend because of the open kitchen.   The wait for food was a solid hour after we ordered. The kitchen was maxed out and full of cooks so I know they were not shorthanded.   The next disappointment was the portions. Small portions are fine but these prices didn't make sense for the portion size.   Overall the food was tasty but i spent $55 for two and left still very hungy and unsatisfied."}
{"text":"I can't say anything negative about this place. I really love the atmosphere, vibe and decor. Good selection of beers and food was really good. My friends and I had a blast. I love the music and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great midtown spot to hit weather it's for a group gathering on the patio or to just belly up to the bar for lunch, dinner and or libations.  Ryan, Megan and the rest of the staff are extremely service oriented, and really know their stuff!   At this point I believe I have tried almost the whole menu.  The stand outs for me would be the roasted veggie plate, and the wings for the small plates, and as far as main courses go the Pork Chop and the Foie Gras are both on point.  The carmelized bananas are off the chart.  At the end of your time at Joes, the bill comes in Garbage Pail Kids Books and it makes for a fun ending to the outing.  Go try this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Came tonight with my husband for a late night dinner. I had the mussels and they were phenomenal. Absolutely perfectly cooked and great flavor. My husband had the BIG burger and it looked weird. I wasn't so sure about it but glad he ordered it. Very unique but truly delicious. We loved everything so much we decided to order the wings just to try them. Again they were great. Can't praise Joe's enough. Loved it.   Our server was also extremely friendly and very helpful with our choices. We will be back and we will bring all our friends."}
{"text":"Joe's is officially on my rotation of favorite restaurants!  The vibe is cool. Music is fun. Staff is welcoming. Food is amazing. Great wine and cocktail list."}
{"text":"Overall most the food was pretty ok, the milanesa sandwich was terrible, it was tough and flavorless. The cantina poutine and skirt steak where good. The service is what warrants the two star review. The server didn't have a basic knowledge of the menu and was borderline combative through the entire meal. It just set a weird mood for the dinner, having a server like that was combative and I think went out of his way to make us feel uncomfortable. I still tipped him 20% cause with an attitude like his, he's gonna need the money when he's out of work, which is gonna be soon if he keeps acting like that towards patrons.  Edit: I'm gonna bump the review up to three stars because even though they cooked my steak wrong and the server spilled some of my drink in my lap and didn't even try to wipe it up, the overall experience on my second visit wasn't terrible and it seemed like the overall meal was better-ish. I really want to not hate this place but they have to try harder."}
{"text":"As a loyal customers that goes there at least 5 times  a month we will  never go back again if  they treat loyal customer this way I feel sorry for the new customers  The whole patio was empty"}
{"text":"The burger is exceptional, highly recommended. Fries with chorizo sauce is great, open from 3pm to 2am.  Staff are great never did my drink go dry"}
{"text":"This place is the Shit. If you wanna go eat the food your momma made while listening to music your mama would never let you, come here."}
{"text":"Love Joe's Midnight Run!  We've already been twice in one week and this place is fabulous.  You can eat shared plates of apps/entrees.  You just can't go wrong.  So far we are fans of the short ribs, wings, curried cauliflower and steaks.  My husband had the burger and it's INSANE.  he loved it!  It's really unusual.  We've also had the apple pie dessert which was out of this world.  Then it gets better...  it's all 80's.  Just when you think the night can't go better, the A-Team comes on the TV's!  It's awesome.    They have a fabulous wine list and awesome bar tenders.  Whoever picked out their liquors did amazing.  Unusual choices, along with items we recognized - and it was all awesome.    They have an open kitchen and we recommend sitting up at the food bar to watch them cook in their amazing ovens!   It's, like, totally rad!"}
{"text":"If I could do 10 stars it wouldn't be enough!! This place absolutely exceeded all expectations in every single category!! Our waiters name was chris. Very mellow fellow but he went ABOVE AND BEYOND! He asked if we were returning or new, once we told him it was our first time he proceeded to open up the menu and explain each cocktail in detail, then placed our order for drinks. Came back and did the same for all the food items. This guy knew his stuff and you could tell he actually cares about his customers and wants them to have the best experience possible!!  I ordered the pork chop and my girlfriend ordered the salmon. Both plates were so good we hardly spoke to each other until the plates were clean! Our drinks were brought out quickly and were well balanced, not watered down or too strong.  I am normally pretty strict with reviews as I was in the business for years. This place left me with nothing negative to say at all.  I'm a huge hip hop head, especially the old stuff. So when we sat on the patio and were graced with non stop 90's hits from biggie, digital underground and why tang, to name a few I was more then pleased?! And when pictures of biggie and TLC are on the menu, you know it's legit.  In closing, we will be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"\"Born sinner, the opposite of a winner, remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner?\" ? Notorious B.I.G., \"Juicy\"  First things first, our server Clayton is AMAZING!  He's personable, charismatic, and friendly.  He's everything I needed after a nine-hour shift at work.  Keep the pipe and slippers, I needed a drink after work.  He brought my Moscow Mule in the coldest copper mug ever and I felt like I was home.  And not just that, we were three of the most indecisive gals you could possible wait on and he did it with a smile and friendly chatter!  Give this guy a raise!  He even warned us about the neighboring businesses towing cars.  Yeesh.  Anyways, so we ordered a lot of food.  The three of us spent $136 on three appetizers, three entrees, a dessert, and some drinks.  Here's what we got [minus the drinks]:  BLISTERED SHISHITOS - leek & lemon aioli, sea salt, $8:  I was all about these!  They're not spicy and the leek and lemon aioli made these crazy good.  I also liked the sea salt on these babies.  They were sweet and for $8, you get a pretty hefty portion.    CANTINA POUTINE - fresh chorizo gravy & mahon, $11:  Rich, decadent and a sodium bomb!  These were served hot and stayed pretty cheesy the whole time.  I couldn't really taste the chorizo but the mahon cheese was slightly sharp, super milky, and definitely salty.  Tran D. seemed to favor these the most out of all the appetizers.  BONE MARROW - fennel, parsley, lemon & sea salt, $14:  I would definitely suggest that you pass on the bone marrow.  It was definitely much too small of a portion and was definitely more bone than marrow.  Two pieces of bread, cut into halves, accompanied the marrow but there was no way there would be enough marrow for all the bread.  We barely had enough to get a pea-sized amount on three breads.  FISH TACOS - raw fish, pineapple, and corn on the cob, $14:  Tran D. had ordered these and I think she was anticipating something different.  She didn't enjoy these.  FLAT IRON STEAK x2 - brussel sprouts, oyster mushrooms, truffle, $24:  Jannette L. and I each ordered a steak.  Mine was cooked a perfect medium-rare and her steak was still mooing and *barely* cooked to her perfect rare.  My steak was pretty freakin' bomb.  Good sear, nicely pink, with a hint of ruby in the middle.  Seasoning was on point and it would have been delicious on its own but was made better because we had asked for steak sauce.  Joe's does not carry A1 steak sauce and instead makes steak sauce to order.  If you love horseradish, you'll love the steak sauce they make!  I added some Cholulu in mine and magnifique!  I would order this again and again.  Even the vegetables were amazing.  S'MORES, $8:  A giant cloud of marshmallow, a few bits of Hershey's, tiny pieces of graham cracker, and a light layering of chocolate sauce.  It's a s'mores.  I think you know how it tastes.  All in all, I had a great meal at Joe's and the music was great.  Children of the 80's and 90's will rejoice!  The fact that they open so late is pretty great and the food was excellent all around.  What are you waiting for?  Come to Joe's!  Chef Michael Goldsmith is waiting to make some steak sauce for ya!  \"Now honies play me close like butter played toast.  From the Mississippi down to the East Coast!\""}
{"text":"Joe's is still killer. Best wings ever and they don't give you the stink eye if you order food at 1:50 am (NOT that I recommend this -- we in the food industry know it's not polite to do this less than 15-20 min prior to closing unless absolutely necessary for survival, lol). Just saying, they're professionals which is extremely rare for a casual place...  Behind the bar hopefully you'll find Bevin; come here once or twice and she'll remember what you like to eat/drink. As for servers, no one knows the menu more than Chris. Just as importantly, I believe their backbone is Geraldo (\"G\" or \"Suave\" as I've heard him called); without him the place would not run so smoothly. Wine & beer menus continue to be refreshingly unique and well thought-out. And where else can you enjoy 40oz of beer in house or TO GO?? Whaaaaaaaat???"}
{"text":"Cool adaptive reuse of bldg & concept. Good food & beer selection. Reasonable prices & knowledgeable waitstaff. Will be back"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is beautiful, chef's options are delicious, it's certainly a little on the pricier side, but... they have a DOG friendly menu! Go for happy hour and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"A friend told us about this restaurant. I had a different impression of the place before I got here. I'm surprised how nice it was decorated inside and out. When we walked in we were greeted by a hostess who had major attitude. She's the only reason I can't give the restaurant 2 out of 5 stars. She asked how many of us and we said 2. For some reason she rolled her eyes at another co-worker when she walked us to the table. I wanted to say something and leave, but I was asked to be nice. I asked to be seated at a table where my back was not in the isle. She gave the 2 of us a table which was set for 4. She grabbed the other 2 place settings off the table. She could have let us sit at the bar. Or we could have gone to another restaurant down the street.   The ambience is very clean, up to date and interesting. The server introduced us to the menu and we ordered. The food is very good. I had the hamburger. Loved it with the exception of the pork rines on top. The upside down apple pie with Ice cream was very good. When I got the check I was surprised that out dinner was not expensive.   Other than the attitude of the hostess who apparently was annoyed with us when we came in, this is a good place to eat a early dinner or hang out for happy hour"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing late-night bites. We enjoyed every single dessert they have on the menu and loved them all. The big surprise was the hot apple tart - oh my land, so yummy. Service was amazing, even with a smaller bill - we were taken care of just as if we were spending hundreds. Thanks so much for a great visit!!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to visit this super cool restaurant today for brunch. First, let me just say that this place is gorgeous. Open kitchen, large patio dining, full bar, and well lit. I love the cool vibes here. The staff was friendly and fast. Ok, down to the food. The jerk chicken & waffles with mango was delicious. The sweet and spicy sauce works harmoniously with the savory fried chicken breast. The mango brought a little sweet and sourness to this dish. The waffles, well, waffles are never not delicious:). Dish two was shakshuka. It was perfectly cooked. Very light, and visually stunning. My favorite was the grilled pulco (grilled octopus). Cooked to perfection and perfectly flavored. This dish is on their dinner menu, but I was told that chef will accommodate if customers ask for it.  Ok, here is what I love most about this place. Thur stay open until... wait for it... 2 am!! Yup, you heard it! This means delicious food literally in the middle of the night into early morning. This is a rarity here in AZ. So party up folks because the staff at this restaurant got you covered for delicious late night eating. For more delicious food posts, follow me @brooklyn409 on Instagram."}
{"text":"The mimosas are soooooo delicious!!!   ordered the chilaquiles but they forgot the eggs, the dish had steak always yummy but it was more like nachos than chilaquiles... also had the chorizo and eggs it was okay.. I'll try lunch next time  will not order those dishes again."}
{"text":"First time here and had the worst experience. We had to be seated at the bar because all the tables were reserved but empty . The girl working at the bar was really rude. she didn't greet us  she just put the menu down on the bar and walked away. Than I asked for a drink and she was very rude. First time here and very sad because I won't be back. I loved the music!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. We had wings, the gaucho platter, mushroom and cheese on toasted bread and finished with the apple pie tartine.  The food was good, but the dessert was outstanding. The sauce perfectly flavored and the dough/crust heavenly.  We had good service. We sat outside due to the high noise level inside. Couldn't hear ourselves talk in there. We were certainly the oldest people there having dinner at ten pm, but we enjoyed ourselves."}
