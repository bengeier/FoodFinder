{"text":"Awesome spot. Tucked away in a medical building. Love the breakfast sandwiches and chicken pesto panini! Employees were friendly, great place to hang out for a few hours."}
{"text":"My first experience at Matteo's was back in the day when they were located off of Pyle and Pollock.  Their po-boy sandwiches were off the hook (along with everything else on the menu).  We eventually moved away but returned to Vegas earlier this year.  While doing my usual online routine trying to find good restaurants near our new home, I came across Matteo's Gourmet Cafe.  Could it be....the same restaurant from years earlier?  YES!!!  Their menu has changed a bit (no more po-boys), but the one thing that is still the same,  the quality of the food.  They specialize in a wide variety of sandwiches and salads, and everything is made fresh.  I can't recommend this place enough.  
They are located in the lobby of a medical building at the corner of Coronado Center Dr. and W Horizon Ridge Pkwy.  Their prices are very reasonable and I would definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I go here regularly since I live nearby and discovered they make amazing smoothies. I always order the Apple Mint Lemonade. It's so delicious & refreshing!  Honestly it's one of my favorite drinks anywhere around; you will just have to try it so your taste buds know what I mean.  

The cafe is nestled quietly inside the Coronado Medical center and there is shaded parking in the back.  

Another reason I give it 5 stars is because of the high quality of food.  You can definitely taste and see that the ingredients are not the cheap stuff.  It's a great place to go on your lunch break or relax for a morning coffee/breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"I have been following this establishment on the social networks, today was the grand opening, I walked in to a very clean place, two person operation, friendly and professional. The menu is very healthy oriented, I opted for the chicken pesto panini, whew it was a good proportion, I am full to say the least, chicken was tender, mixed greens, tomato, roasted red peppers all fresh and the melted mozzarella,  and the made from scratch pesto sauces meshed everything well. I would highly recommend to you too all check this place out, can not wait to go again to try other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Its an out of the way spot, but the Cubano sandwich I had was tasty, the ham and the pork was lean with no fat, quality ingredients in the veggies and condiments. My daughter had the grilled cheese Panini and my wife had the reuben, all 3 sandwiches were excellent. The 2 people there, a young man and young woman were very friendly and they showed pride in what they did."}
