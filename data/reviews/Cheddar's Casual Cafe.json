{"text":"Similar to Applebees/Chilis, with a large menu and enormous portions. We split the texas cheese fries, he had the hawaiian chicken sandwich, and I had the hawaiian chicken salad. We had lots of leftovers! The food was alright, and as mentioned before prices are a little higher than expected. If you've got family with picky eaters coming to town, this should be pretty safe. Also, the restaurant was packed when we went (6pm on a Saturday night after a basketball game), but it only took 5-10 minutes for us to be seated."}
{"text":"we came to cheddars not quite knowing what to expect.  what we did discover was a chilis knockoff with prices that didn't quite match the food quality.  needless to say we were a little bummed.

to cheddar's' credit? my chicken strips made a great meal the day after. at least the $10 they cost lasted two meals worth!"}
{"text":"Sadly, the Cheddars in Champaign, IL closed as of early April. They sold the location and were going to bulldoze it, last I heard. We are now in Springfield, MO, and found the same great food here. This one always has a line, though. 

To Paul W. and the rest of the Cheddars' crew, thanks for the memories."}
{"text":"I've visited several Cheddar's restaurants (Champaign - most recently, Peoria, Rockford - now closed), and have always been delighted with the experience. Great food (Ribs & Chicken Strips is my favorite entree) Reasonable prices. Good service. I would go more often if there was one near my town. I would choose Cheddar's over Chili's/Applebee's/Ruby Tuesday's without thinking twice."}
{"text":"Okay food at okay prices. Tends to get pretty busy."}
