{"text":"Went for a late dinner, sat in the side room, which was playing great music (although pretty loud). DELICIOUS poutine (the mushroom one), and the vegetable quesadilla. Attentive and polite wait staff. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Whoa, upon entering this bar late on a Saturday night I was immediately thrown back to the bar scene in Madrid, Spain circa 2001.  It's extremely huge, has an extensive drink list, loud music, and tons of young professionals in their going-out wear eating dinner here at midnight on a Saturday night, their evening presumably just getting started.  Playlist is good, spinning out all the latest hits and pop-y tunes to get your night going.  I loved the extensiveness of the drink menu but I found most of my drinks to be too sweet for my liking (I had the Lychee martini and Cuban Fizz). There are people however going straight to the shots and dancing in the walkways. This is a one stop shop on your Saturday night path to destruction, no doubt! Come here for a crazy night."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks on 4/17/2015 with my date before dinner. We ordered 2 Pimm's cups, 1 Pineau'ito (fruity mojito-esque drink) , and 1 Sapporo beer. Bartenders dressed in vests and uniform. They were very nice and friendly. Did not bother us or push us to get more drinks.

When I went looking for the washroom, I was almost at the back of the place, I asked a server, he said it was upstairs. I did not see a way to go up so I asked how to get up there, he said to use the stairs or fly. I laughed and said I'll fly the next time. So I turned around and saw a huge staircase... how embarrassing. In my defense, there were no signs indicating where the washroom was. But how did I miss the staircase???"}
{"text":"Headed here late in the evening after watching my Pats kick Jets ass. Sunday night around 10pm, (worthy) options to grab a bite and drinks were somewhat limited. My fellow Yelpers reviews directed me to L'assommoir, and I couldn't be happier about the results. 

Tapas options allowed us to share dishes with me and my Lady. Artichoke Dip was great, the Beef Ceviche was tasty and well presented, and the calamari was super tender and fresh. But of course, they specialize in drinks, in which the menu was extensive and well made, even categorized. Albeit my drink came out in a girly glass, but I should've expected it by the name, 'Tropical Blend'. Still delicious. 

Good music, ambience, vibe and decor. Pretty intimate setting as well and even the Mens room was clean and stylish, for whatever that's worth. Open until 3am QAM - that means 'every morning' in medical terms.

{"text":"Walked into the bar and was immediately impressed with the atmosphere and ambiance. After finding a seat at the bar was graciously met by the very knowledgable bartender who made the first round of drinks. After that we ordered absinthe and was even more impressed by the entire presentation. The bar was a little pricy but  well with the evening. Had a great time."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Bartender was way more concerned about doing shots with his buddies than attending to other patrons."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great ambiance. What a find in Old Montreal!

I recently went with girlfriends during a short visit to Montreal. The crowd is young, vibrant, and non-pretentious. They have an extensive cocktail list, and a wide menu of tapas food options - many of which were raw like tartar and ceviche. Perfect for my palette! My friends enjoyed their steaks, and one raved about her salmon entree. Overall it was a great place to dine with friends."}
{"text":"Super ambiance, bonne sélection de boissons. Les prix sont adaptés au quartier. Bien que les serveurs et serveuses soient gentils, le service n'est pas toujours rapide. Le duo tartare thon et saumon est bon, les acras de morue aussi, mais nous avons aussi goûté au rouleau de printemps qui eux n'était pas très bon. Globalement OK, surtout pour l'ambiance."}
{"text":"Aah, L'Assomoir. Such a dreamy place. (You know this is going to be a positive review.)

This restaurant slash bar is the perfect place for young professionals...as well as older ones. Unlike its older brother on Bernard street, L'Assomoir Notre-Dame has a bar permit, allowing you to drink without having to order food. But you'd be crazy to pass by the delicious tapas, ceviches and tartars they offer. 

I personally love the \"Gueuleton\", a huge plate of appetizers for two, four or six people. One of the appetizers included in the \"Gueuleton\" is the \"Bonbons de saumon\", which is probably one of the best things I've ever eaten. It's better suited for people who like raw fish, but one of my friends doesn't usually eat any and she loved it. You might be surprised, because it doesn't taste like anything you've tried before.
 
If you're not so hungry, you can always opt for the GOOD STUFF: the booze. The large variety of drinks is quite astounding (over 200), with concoctions with quirky names like \"GHB\" and \"Biktini\". I can't say I've tried every single one of them - would that make me an alcoholic? - but I've tried enough to say your taste buds will thank you...your liver not so much. The combination of flavours is sometimes unexpected but always interesting.

If you're concerned about your wallet, maybe L'Assomoir isn't the best place for you. However, if you're willing to spend around 50 bucks/person + tip for a good meal and a bunch of drinks, then this place if for you. The service is excellent, warm and the atmosphere feels young and hip, without being snobby or exclusive. It may not be the best spot for an intimate date, since L'Assomoir is often filled with people and noisy, but that's what makes it so exciting. I believe there's a DJ on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.  
And for all of you hockey fans out there, they have TVs, so you don't even have to worry about missing a game! Didn't I say it was a dreamy place? I sure did."}
{"text":"If you've ever heard that service in montreal is terrible, it's because of places like this. None of the main courses are good but the appetizers and tartars are excellent. Just a bit pricey. Drinks are good but they hype it up. It's loud fyi but the ambiance is cool and it turns into a great bar clubby thing later on. 
I went 4 times because I won
 a bunch of vouchers (used them the 3 last times). They gave me a hard time EVERY time I tried to use them. Always an argument. Took my mother there for her bday with family (one of the vouchers was for a bday) and our waiter was so unbelievable uppity and rude. When we tried to pay the bill (after arguing about the voucher) he targeted my 62 year old mother and insisted that the voucher did not include his tip. In about 1 minute he said the word \"service\" or tip 18 times to her. He was so hung up on his tip that we couldn't get to the payment. Had he just said it once and let us pay (or even if he hadn't mentioned anything) he would have gotten a great tip - not because the service was good, just because we always tip at least 20%. He did 15% but should have given him a buck. They also lost a scarf at coat check. Found it the next day and had to go back and get it. No biggie, but doesn't help their situation."}
{"text":"L'assommoir was a pretty cool place.  Really hip ambiance and music playing at 10 pm on a Thursday night.  For a bar with only about 30-40 people in it, we were surprised at the 15-20 minute wait for drinks.  Still a cool place, just don't go there hungry, as the food takes longer than the drinks do.  This place is all about the vibe and it definitely delivers.  Definitely an awesome place to take a date."}
{"text":"We came on Saturday April 16th, 2016 for 'Oyster Mania'. We had reservation and we're quickly escorted to our table. Best part of the night was now over.

Took 15 minutes to finally get a glass of water and another 30 for our Oysters, 15 minutes later we got our drinks. We had plan to eat dinner, but after waited for nearly 1 hour and 30 minutes, we decided to leave and go somewhere else for dinner.

We have received better service in 3rd world countries than we did here. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, unless I want to ruin your night!"}
{"text":"Went to the Old Montreal location for my girlfriend's birthday with 6 of our friends and we had such a good time ! Reason #1: great cocktails ! Reason #2: amazing food that you can either get as a plate, or as a jumbo tapas version that you can share Reason #3: VERY cute and lovely waitress...
Only negative comment: DJ, turn the music down, it's way too loud to have any kind of conversation"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times and enjoy the food, drinks and atmosphere.  The place has a ton of drinks (a book) and is categorized very nicely.  There  is quite possibly every spirit known to man on the wall (may be hyperbole, but I digress).

The menu is tapas based.  The chorizo and calamari are definitely worth trying.  The calamari is very tender and not dried out like a lot of other calamari I have had.

I usually order the Illegal Iced Tea as a drink...its basically a long island iced tea with absinthe.  Also, there B57 shots are fun too, if you don't mind sucking up burning alcohol.  

There is a small dance floor towards the back of the restaurant with a disco ball that happens later on in the evening.

All in all a good place to grad some drinks and assortment of Spanish tapas with some friends or a girlfriend."}
{"text":"If you do not speak French, or know someone who works there be prepaid to be treated like shit. This place won the biggest a-holes award on my recent trip. They kept us waiting long after the 5 min they said, and then stuck us in a table only to get no service for even a drink after another 10 min. We decided to walk out instead of giving these hipper than thou pricks a dime..."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés entre amis un samedi soir. La nourriture était très décevante, beaucoup trop de sucre dans tous les plats (des tartares sucrés, un risotto sucré; bien essayé, mais vraiment très mal exécutés!). Les éperlans séchés sont à éviter à tout prix! Les vins avaient le mérite d'être bons, mais le serveur n'y connaissait rien (quand on lui a demandé la différence entre deux vins, il nous a dit que l'un était corsé et que l'autre était \"smooth\"...). Service excessivement lent (arrivés à 21h00, dessert servi à MINUIT!!!). Vraiment, je ne le recommande pas, à moins d'avoir envie de faire un 5 à 7 pour boire des cocktails, mais n'y mangez surtout pas, d'autres adresses dans le coin en valent beaucoup plus la peine."}
{"text":"From the other reviews it seems this place has a reputation as more of a bar/night club than restaurant which is fine.  However, I hope that doesn't over shadow the amazing food.  I had the bison tartar soaked in glennfiddich.  Man, that was fantastic!  I also had an amazing mixed drink, of sake, cointreau, sapporo and ginger that was so tasty and perfectly mixed.  I couldn't taste the other ingredients it was so well done.  My husband had the filet mignon which was perfect cooked.  We finished with desert and espresso.  Service was great.  Even if you are not a nightclub type, I'd recommend going early for the food."}
{"text":"The worst service ever.  I was seated near the door in January - it's 8 degrees outside - so the location was chilly  In the first 10 mins they took my drink order, which was brought to me about 15 minutes later.  I asked to be moved to a different table away from the front door, and they accommodated me, but from then on I was totally ignored. I placed my dinner order with the water/busman and asked for some bread twice. 30 minutes later nothing showed up.  I finally gave up and paid for the one glass of wine that I ordered an hour earlier, and went elsewhere for dinner. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent endroit pour prendre un verre entre amis ou pour une premier rendez-vous. Le décor sombre et L'ambiance intimiste sont parfaits pour terminer la semaine en beauté. Difficille de choisir un cocktail, parce que la carte offre une vaste sélection de délicieuses boissons. Faites confiance au serveur!"}
{"text":"Most unsatisfied with our group dinner at L'Assommoir. 

We were there at 20:30 and ready to order but the waitress was finally able to bring the appetizers at 22:30! Very slow and sloppy service. She poured me a glass of water and spilled half on the table; she smiled dump and didn't even bother come back and clean. I had to eat all dinner on a wet table. Despite the fact we told her that some of us are working the next day, she brought at the last course at midnight. Unbelievable!

Now about the food. With such a protracted service damn right we were hungry and we'd have gladly eaten anything. Unfortunately the bifteck canard looked like surest way to get a gastro. Sadly it tasted the same too: too salty and disgustingly sweet. It came with some french fries which were oily, overburnt, and obviously reheated. What a terrible combination. My colleague had the same type of fries with her steak. We could not help to remark that the servings at the table looked more like cafeteria food than a pretentious restaurant.
You might be curious about the decor. The ambiance was almost stressful noisy. The selection of songs played by a house DJ were enough to cause indigestion but by the end of the night we had all lost our hearing due to the loudness of the \"music\". 

Somebody told me that he judges a house by the cleaningness of  the bathroom. I think it is enough to say that they didn't excel in that chapter either.
We should have been paid for what we had a bear the whole night nevertheless we were the one to empty our pockets. For what we paid we could have had an excellent meal in many other places.

In conclusion: with bad service, bad food, and an overall noisy stressful ambiance,  L'Assommoir is the perfect place where to ruin your night. If you want your dinner to be over before bedtime then aim to be there at breakfast."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place 3.5 stars - 3 stars for the food, 4 stars for the ambience. 
It's a beautiful spot and absolutely gorgeous to sit and have a drink at the bar. We went with a group and had a reservation for 8:45pm. We got there a bit early and had a drink at the bar - very extensive cocktails menu! We were seated at 8:45pm but weren't able to place our food order until 9:40pm, by which time we were starving. The food did arrive fairly quickly once we ordered, so we were eating shortly after 10pm. Since it was a Saturday night, the place was packed and there was a DJ playing. The only things I didn't like about the atmosphere was that the music was much too loud to be able to talk over, and there was one tv that was on just above the DJ stand. 
I got the beef tartare and a side order of whiskey-maple poutine. The tartare was delicious but the poutine was meh. 
I'd go back again, but likely only for drinks and dessert."}
{"text":"La nourriture a été servie froide (plateau de viande), le service était très lent et les breuvages goûtaient l'eau... Bref nous avons été bien déçus."}
{"text":"Great drinks, food, and service. Nothing was open on New Years Day and this place stood out as an oasis. 

The bar scene is pretty cool in the evening. The staff will do some cool shots including the amazing B57, which includes an awesome show buy Philip and some fire. Try it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Whether or not your friends have all the hookups at the hottest clubs in Old Port, if you're visiting Montreal, I'd say that you owe it to yourself to have a drink at L'Assommoir.

Competing with plenty of nightlife strewn throughout this bar-heavy area in Montreal, L'Assommoir has it's pluses and minuses.  The biggest plus...no line!  Whether you're about to stand in line at Philemon for an hour, or you just left and are looking for a nightcap, look know further.  L'Assommoir has an extensive cocktail menu, with Cajun favorites like the Sazerac, to sweet dessert drinks like the Grasshopper.  I had both and they each did the trick, though they did water down quickly.  Service is average, but on the slow side.  Grab a drink when you have the opportunity.

L'Assommoir provides a great place to start or end your night in Old Port, but don't expect it to raise or lower the bar for the other destinations on your alcohol-infused journey."}
{"text":"N'oubliez pas de réserver c'est souvent plein ! 

Très bon tapas a prix raisonnable pour la qualité dans l'assiette !
Les drinks sont fabuleux !
Le staff est beau !

On y retournera probablement bientôt :)"}
{"text":"L'assommoir offers a rare combination of a dance club with food, but no dancing. It is almost like it couldn't settle on being just a bar with good drinks, they had to throw in the food, too. 
The music was so loud, our table of 6 all lost our voices or just stopped trying to communicate because we couldn't hear the person next to us or across the table from us. We had been warned, but as the night went on and on and on, the music seemed to get louder and the room got progressively darker. We are a bunch of 25-35 year olds, so it wasn't just our age that made us want to ask for a lower volume of music.  
That was part of what ruined the night for me. The second part was that as half of the couple 'hosting' all the out of town guests, I felt somewhat responsible for making things go smoothly. Usually that is the job of the wait staff, no? On at least 4 occasions I had to either get up or assertively hail the waiter over to say things like, \"Can the 3 of us who have been sitting down for more than 10 minutes, but arrived later get menus?\" Or later on, \"We ordered bottled water, can you bring that now?\"  or when the 7 item ceviche and tartar platter arrived, \"Can you explain which is which?\", followed by, \"Can the other half of the table also get a basket of bread?\" 
We didn't get asked if we wanted dessert, though there is a menu, because ~4 hours after our dinner started, I had to walk up to ask for the bill. (Our European guests were so jetlagged, we ended the night early.)  
Perhaps we are old and don't like that new-fangled DJ music. 
Perhaps our waiter was on his first day of work. 
Perhaps the bar was over capacity and raw food takes longer to prepare than cooked stuff (though the 1/6 who ordered steak and didn't split the raw platter had to eat after we were all done!!!) 
Perhaps the cleaning lady quit that day and the lack of toilet paper in the women's restroom was her responsibility. 
Perhaps a million things conspired to make this one of the most uncomfortable evenings ever. I can't recommend this place unless you just want to sit at the bar, have drinks and maybe attempt to order the crab tartare, which was amazing, and you have 3 hours to kill waiting for it.
Bill for 6 people, including 2 bottles of wine, was $50-60 per person."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic tapas restaurant that a date treated me to.  It was cozy and intimate with great tartare dishes and cocktails.  The waiters are very attentive and knowledgeable and the decor is luxurious with high end wood paneling all throughout.  This is the place to go if you want to have a special experience with someone that you won't forget.  The location in the historic Old Port neighborhood gives it an added feel of significance that reminds one of a quaint European city.  I love this place and recommend it when visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"I loved it very much!! Very good price. I got 1$/oyster 
Food is delicious, Service is fast, Prices are affordable"}
{"text":"Very Disappointed. Went to Assommoir for \"MTL a la table\" and would have gathered gone to la bell province for a tastier meal. First we waiting 30 min to get served. We ordered oysters which came late and warm! I ordered the Bison Tartar which was good! Ordered the Deer Osso bucco and my wife ordered the Fish. My Deer was as the menu said Smoked. HORRIBLE! all you tasted was the burnt outside and the meat was very over cooked and dry. My wife ordered the fish with came half raw. When the waitress finally came by she asked if everything was ok. i just said that the Deer was not to my liking. she took it as if i insulted her and told me it was clear on the menu that it was smoked. I didn't want to argue so i asked for the dessert and check.The dessert was also over cooked and dry. couldn't finish it either. we paid and left. the biggest disappointment was this week was the time for the restaurants to shine . My wife and i took a special night to go on a date night and this restaurant spoiled the night. Bad service , Bad food, Disappointed !"}
{"text":"Good place for drinks. The manhattans were good and they had a lot of options. The service was pretty good. We ordered food and that took a very long time to come. The food was good but nothing special. The calamari was good and not chewy. The ambience was pretty good and spacious. It was pretty drafty in there though, so if you are trying to escape the cold it wasn't the best option. Overall go for drinks!"}
{"text":"I came here on new year's day for an 80s poplife party hosted by DJ Esan Ellis. For a freezing cold day, the event was a nice way to warm up -free street parking and no crazy long lineup to get in with a packed crowd inside. 

Decor: very typical bar/lounge setting as typically found in Old Port. Oddly enough the art work leading up to the second floor reminded me of South Beach with the neon coloured graffiti pop art.  You can't miss the large disco ball by the DJ booth! There was also a large dance floor. 

Drinks: the cocktail menu was very elaborate, listing their most popular drinks to my favourite old fashioned list. Phil who was the bartender serving me made a mean old fashioned. All elements were perfectly measured and garnished. I had the after-war and the Chimney (which had smokier notes -hence the name implies). I liked the second one better. The drinks are pricey starting at 12$ and easily adding up- I was still satisfied. 

Service: ask for Phil!! Excellent service.

I am looking forward to come back one day for their oysters!"}
{"text":"While on a long weekend in Montreal, came here for drinks and lite appetizers on the recommendation of our hotel concierge.  I had a Caparina and my wife tried a few different Martinis.  Enjoyed all of the drinks.

We also tried the Venison Tartar.  Although not a fan of raw food, I've got to say the dish with the truffle oil was a great light dish.

Coming in around 4:30 on a Friday afternoon, I've got to say that the bar tending staff could have been a bit more attentive.  But moving beyond that, the atmosphere was just right for our first afternoon in Montreal."}
{"text":"While walking through old Montreal on our weekend trip we stopped here for some afternoon drinks and a bite. They have a very long list of drinks to choose from and everything we tried was delicious and  strong! The food was very good, we had duck poutine for the first time here and it was the best poutine we had in our trip, even better than La Banquise. If I'm ever in Montreal again this is a stop I will be making."}
{"text":"This little gem is tucked away in Old Montreal on the cobble stone streets of Notre Dame. It has great drinks, a small but great list of absinthe, and decent food! I wouldn't go there solely to eat, but paired with good music (and live bands), good company, and good drinks, it's worth it. I would recommend any of the meat platters to share, it's delicious for the most part!"}
{"text":"went here for late night drinks, were very satisfied. when we went out for a smoke break, the didn't take our drinks away either so we ended up staying for another round!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from LA, so for me, the idea of easily walking into a bar on a Friday night and finding a decent table was pretty awesome.  The look of this place was super cool and dark and the music selection was FANTASTIC!  There is a definitely a good Friday night vibe here. However, the waiter that we got, was kind of pushy and a little too cool.  Like he was friendly, but wasn't very interested in our table as the guy at the table next to us was spending a ridiculous amount of money on alcohol and would obviously pay a bigger tip.  At this same time he kept making expensive suggestions on the menu.  I found that to be unpleasant.
I think if we had a different server, my experience would have warranted more stars.  Maybe next time?"}
{"text":"Jeudi soir 10h pm, je suis avec des collègues. Nous cherchons un endroit pour prendre un verre et un propose cet endroit. De l'extérieur je suis vendu. Je vois pleins de bouteilles et un gros écriteau avec JEUDI OLD SCHOOL SPECIAUX etc etc. Ouain......je ne savais pas que Old school pour le DJ c'était Julie Masse, de la musique pas dansante et triste. Bref de la musique hyper déprimante. Je vais aux toilettes, les toilettes sont au deuxième et mixte...whats up l'intimité. Non pas que ça me dérange sauf que...c'est minuscule 2 toilettes pour couvrir beaucoup de gens gars et filles. Et on s'entends on est dans le vieux, pas au Milend ou dans le Village, alors on risque de retrouver des gens moins ouvert d'esprit. Bref, il y avait beaucoup de gens de bureau qui on dirait avaient allongé leur 5@ tard. Quelques personnes dans un état d'ivresse level 100000. Le service est lent. Par contre, on a une table pour 7. Trop sombre pour regarder le menu de cocktail et la musique continue à être déprimante. J'allume ma lampe de poche de cell. Il y a beaucoup beaucoup beaucoup de choix de cocktail!! En effet, avec les centaines de bouteilles qu'il y a sur le mur derrière le bar, cela ce comprend. Il y a une feuille de spéciaux. Bien sûre, nous sommes 7, mais seulement une seule feuille avec les speciaux nous est attribué. J'ai pris un Pisco Sour. Il est fait avec du blanc d'oeuf.  Très bon, mais un peu fort. Mes collègues avaient l'air satisfait avec leur drink. En plus ils sont en bas de 9$. 

Je prends ensuite une Sleeman en bouteille qui est en special à 3.91$ et le serveur me dit elles sont à 2 pour 8,50$ et je le regarde en lui disant ben sur le menu c'est écrit 3.91$. Il me regarde d'un air bête et me reponds..tu connais le menu mieux que moi... Bref...Oui j'y retournerai mais en 5@7. Car à 10h plus jamais. C'est un bar qui ma fortement dessus pour un jeudi soir."}
{"text":"Just went there tonight for supper and drinks. The drinks were ok though the martini was a bit strong to my liking. Food was not that great. I had the fish and chips. The batter was thick and too greasy. My girlfriend had the bison hamburger. The meat was too dry and the spices added did not compliment the meat at all. Be advised that the music is loud. It was  not an issue for us but it's not the best place to have a long conversation."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the Old Port, L'Asssomoir is a delicious restaurant with a great ambiance and lively environment. The crowd is young, loud and fun - there was a DJ playing live music - and the food is excellent. We went to dinner late, maybe around 9:30, and the place was still packed with a large dinner and drinks crowd.

The menu is quite eclectic ranging from Spanish tapas, Latin American appetizers and tapas and wide array of tartares. 

We ordered the plantain chips which we awesome - although I doubt that they were homemade. It brought us back to our 5-week trip to Costa Rica. My boyfriend ordered the Duck Confit Quesadillas and I got the Green Apple & Salmon Tartare. He enjoyed his - wasn't blown away, but it was good. Mine on the other hand was amazing. The salmon was fresh and bright and totally delicious. I would go back here in a heart beat.

{"text":"Menu isn't anything amazing at least not the sharing ones. we made due as we showed up for oystermania so I wasn't really looking to eat anything else as I had another oystermania at Joverse 2 hours later but we did share the cheese and octopus which was good but wish the cheese had more honey as it's fried goat cheese so it's very overwhelming. Octopus needed a bit more flavours but it was a great dish.

Drinks were good but a bit steep.

The vibe here is cool but there was a huge party in the back enjoying a family party with slides of their vacation playing which took away from the actually restaurant.

I would come back for drinks but food wise prlly not as much."}
{"text":"Super endroit, bien situé dans le vieu (pas loin du métro Places d'Armes), très cosy et chaleureux à l'intérieur.
Bonne ambiance et bonne musique (tubes du moment remixés, Enrique Iglesias, Rihanna, etc..)
5@7 sur les drinks, 5 à 7 $ pour bière ou cocktail, ça vaut la peine!
On y était dans le cadre de Oystermania (jusqu'au 30.10.2016) et les huîtres étaient très bonnes, la sauce excellente.
Très bon service!

A bit on the pricey side however, but most things are there. 

I tried two of their 4 (woohoo) Bloody Caesars, the classic and the Italian.
I preferred the Italian, the classic wasn't super outstanding. 
We were seated in the back near this cool wine section I totally want in my own house now...very pretty, next time I'll try one of the wines."}
{"text":"we arrived around 11pm not knowing what to expect for a late dinner, but this was by far the best bison burger and steak tartar I've had in my life. Service was wonderful - our server was really busy but was so sweet and did his best to be attentive while covering the entire bar area by himself. After the entire weekend of eating out, I wished we had had all our meals here."}
{"text":"This is a busy place. Service is slow, BUT the food is inventive and satisfying. Salmon and coconut ceviche? Yes, please.

The mini burger was overdone, but the flavour and seasoning was spot on.
Mini Scallop burger. Easy to get this one wrong. They got it right.

Drinks were expensive, but no more so than the neighbourhood average. Atmosphere? About a 9.

Well done, L'Assommoir. You have a new fan."}

The service is friendly and enjoyable.

I would definitely come back again :)"}
{"text":"I love L'Assommoir.   I have been to locations on both Bernard and Notre Dame.  The format fits my preferences perfectly:  Their drink list is extensive - notably, featuring many signature cocktail creations as well as an eclectic and upscale menu that includes a variety of small plates, specializing in tartares and ceviches (and grilled meats?).   

Since the cocktail list comprises 250+ concoctions I can't say that I've even put a dent in the list.  I don't care for too much sweetness in my drinks.  I like the G.H.B, despite the name and I have ordered it a few times - From the web site (where you can see all their drinks) this is chartreuse verte, dry gin, kiwi & basil, dash each of maple syrup and apple juice.  On balance, I'd love to see a more extensive lineup of daringly creative cocktails, perfectly executed - innovative mixology  genius.  The cocktails featuring seafood are good, but are overpriced  since they're not outstanding.  I have tried at least two - you will basically have an average tasting cocktail, with some tuna or salmon on a little wooden skewer in your drink.  

The small plates are eclectic, very well done for the most part and they frequently change their specials.  I've enjoyed their foie gras, accras de morue (cod fritters), ceviches and tartares (these you can mix and match for a set price).  On Notre Dame I had an unusual and especially delicious salmon tartare where the salmon was not cut into small cubes, but rather presented in strips and fairly thickly sliced with fresh mango (?)  I also really enjoyed the tartare de wapiti.  Their kitchen uses thoughtfully selected, high quality oils and seasonings.

L'Assommoir on Bernard becomes very busy on weekends, but the music remains at reasonable decibels while people are still having dinner (not sure about later on).  It seems very popular for large groups in the back.  Reserve ahead or be prepared to possibly eat at the bar. But this is okay, the bartenders might do glass throwing tricks for you and show you as they light up your lemon peel.  Also, you could get personalized drink recommendations and chat with them about their craft.  

The decor at the Notre-Dame location in Old Monreal is different from the one on Bernard.  It has a more upscale feel and yet it is a relaxed atmosphere, service is quite informal.  There is at least one television at one end of the room.  There is ample seating on both ground floor and upper level mezzanine.  The ceilings are high and the bar is made to look like an amber facade with solid paneling from floor to ceiling, for dramatic flair.  The bar is shrouded in soft warm amber light.  The shelves and big cubby holes along the back of the bar are lit so as to showcase the collection.  

L'Assommoir certainly distinguishes itself as being fantastic for a late night bite, particularly on Sundays since most of the restaurants in Old Montreal do not serve past 10PM.  Here you can get the the full menu until very late every day, could it be until 3 in the morning?!!  Do not however, expect a crowd, since Old Montreal late after 11 on Sunday is extremely subdued (pretty much lifeless).  Though as a local at this time it feels home-y, among almost all locals.  
 
I dock for service b/c it is inconsistent although it is perfectly acceptable for a bar.

{"text":"I've seen the inside of a few drinking holes.  The L'assommoir beverage list was the most comprehensive I've ever seen.  Indeed, I mentioned this fact, and was told that the drink menu is the third largest \"in the Americas\" (as in, North and South continents).  Whether true or not, it struck me as plausible. 

To be clear:  this is not a bargain spot.  We dropped $30-35 over three drinks.  But in terms of what it sets out to be -- viz., a premium bar with professional barkeeps who make amazing drinks -- it executes beautifully.  If you have a taste for fine beverages and want them done properly, this is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"What an excellent experience we had here.  Again, it's overpriced (minus half a star), as per typical for old Montreal, but it was excellent. I walked in looking for a good beer (joined later by my wife) and ended up having great tasting ceviche and mahi mahi apps to boot!  Also, my wife (a sangria connoisseur given her intake) rates the the blanc sangria as excellent, as was my on tap Quebec wheat beer (Blanche De Chambly). Only in old Montreal can you get such high quality apps from an a establishment known manly as a bar...kudos!  We recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nous avons découvert ce bar avec des amis et nous avons adoré.

Situé près de la basilique vers place d'armes, ce bar-restaurant ne paie pas de mine mais une fois entrée à l'intérieur waouh !

Le bar est magnifique, les cocktails délicieux et les serveurs vraiment sympa.

Ce que j'ai également apprécié, c'est que la musique n'était pas trop forte ce qui fait que nous pouvons nous entendre parler :-)

Je vous conseil vraiment d'y aller au moins une fois pour aller boire un verre et pourquoi pas y manger aussi :-)"}
{"text":"Stopped in at a weird hour (little past 3:30pm) hoping to get a couple cocktails and something to nibble on to hold us over for a later dinner reservation.  They were participating in the Invasion Cocktail week so they offered a bunch of new/newer cocktails to celebrate the week. Overall, the drinks we tried were okay, not great.  Our first round, the Bergie En Chest was definitely better than the Peach Julep and the Mexican Hipster for our second one.  

As for the apps, we should've done our homework and checked the Yelp reviews before we sat our bottoms down on those bar stools.  We opted for one of the Samplers that included plaintain chips, ceviche, salad, veggie quesadillas and calamari.  Sounds like it would be good, right?  No, regrettably a hell no unfortunately.  

The calamari batter was too much.  It didn't showcase the actual calamari well and the plaintain chips were all stale. The veggie quesadilla wasn't terrible but also wasn't memorable and the ceviche didn't have that lime citrus zest that all ceviches should have.

Final verdict?  Come here if you're feeling down to try some adventurous cocktails but do skip the food here unless you really don't care what you're having."}
{"text":"Service super lent, cadre dans le fond sans aucune âme et cachet particulier,  beaucoup de faute de goût dans la décoration et la bouffe est juste correcte"}
{"text":"Si j'ai envie de sortir dans un endroit sans âme, je viendrai ici. Avec l'exception de sorties de groupes avec un belle gang d'amis qui créent l'ambiance, ce resto-bar passe à côté de la track au niveau de la convivialité et le choix musical est souvent un peu bipolaire. Je pourrais pardonner, mais le menu me déçoit aussi. À première vue, tout semble bien bon. Mais une fois dans l'assiette, soit ça manque de goût ou sinon, c'est trop assaisonné (lisez salé). Et le menu des cocktails? Quoiqu'une belle liste bien exhaustive - ils ne sont pas toujours balancés, ni fiables. Parfois, leur sazerac est sur la coche, d'autres fois complètement raté. C'est la même chose pour leurs mojitos. C'est pourtant simple que de suivre une recette standardisée. 

Bref, il y a bien mieux dans le coin. 

Mais bon. Si vous vous cherchez un endroit où souper en gang, ils ont définitivement assez d'espace pour vous recevoir!"}
{"text":"Extensive cocktail menu. Good drinks. Large space. Very good service. Tv's with sports on. 

Amazed by the number of different kinds of shots on the menu. Short walk from the Westin downtown. 

I am sure this will be a riot on weekends. Will definitely come back. I got the Caipirinha and it was yummy. My co-worker got the mac and cheese and calamari and he mentioned they were good too."}
{"text":"I've been there last Saturday with a friend from outside of town who doesn't speak a word of French and was dumbfounded to find out that they had no menus available in English. This place is located in a touristic area. Makes absolutely no sense to me.

We also sat at the bar early (around 6:30 pm) for a drink or two before dinner. It took about 20 min for the waiter to come get our order. We were like 5 clients total at the bar. He was too busy having a discussion with other clients. After we finally got our order (Moscow Mule), the guy served us 10-15 min later, and had put the drinks in regular glasses when my friend said this drink is always served in a copper mug. I also asked him for a napkin that never came.

Very disappointed in this place. I brought my friend there thinking this place was good and we both couldn't wait to leave."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Went there for a Monday night. The bartender told me the last call was at 1:45. At 1:30 he told
Me he was doing last call. When I hadn't even decided what I wanted. This was ridiculous. This place sucks. Never recommend anyone to go there. Sucks."}
{"text":"I like this place but mostly Jean Philippe cause he reminds the movie cocktail. He is good with the bottle and like to give a good show, ask him.
Never tried the food"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late night drink with my guy and promptly lost my ability to hear shortly thereafter. Perhaps I'm getting too old, so I shouldn't fault those who enjoy the peppy music at that decible level. Sorry kids. 

Despite the loudness, you can enjoy an array of lovely tapas and probably the biggest cocktail menu I've ever seen (20+ pages of drinks, drinks, and more drinks). 

We ordered a couple drinks and smiled at all the bottles we recognized on the wall. I don't know why, but little things like that make me happy."}
{"text":"I've always had a thing for disco balls.

Maybe it's the way that they captivate me with their multiple mirrored surfaces like catnip.   They draw me in and stimulate all the right areas of my brain.  I cannot stop staring.  Attention Deficit Heroin.

That's probably what drew me in here.    That, and the fact that they're probably the only place near the fancypants boutique hotels in the old port who happen to have their kitchen open past 10pm.

And what a kitchen it is.     Awesome tapas.   

The place fills up with young professional types.   The atmosphere is warm, friendly and inviting without being too abrasive or in your face.  There wasn't dancing when we were there, but methinks that it was just about to break out.

You cannot argue with a well stocked bar that happens to have delicious food.

I have no idea what the disco ball was all about.   

I cannot get the spinny shiny sugar out of my head."}
{"text":"Nice pub type decor and ambiance.

The menu is a bit limited.   Lots of tartare, seafood tapas, chorizo type fare.   

Located just a few steps from the Notre Dame church."}
{"text":"I came here at the end of a long day at a medical convention.  The food was interesting and very tasty. I sat at the bar, and the bar tender made certain to make feel very welcomed.  This is a place that I would definitely seek out on my next trip here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were walking around old Montreal while visiting for a couple of days and came across this spot. We decided to stop in for a drink, we had 9pm dinner reservations somewhere else. When we arrived, it was quite busy we were seated at the bar which was perfect because we only wanted a drink anyway. The waiter told us that 5$ drinks were on, and showed us a drink menu. My guy ordered a beer, they didn't have a great selection but he picked one from their list, and I asked to see a wine menu. The batman told me they didn't have one, so I ordered a glass of \"white\" wine and received some terrible thing that I could barely drink. I didn't finish it. For a bar, there should be some kind of option for wines? Even if it's written on a board or something. When the bill came, my wine cost $8. I mentioned to the barman and asked about this \"$5 drinks\" thing.. and he told me it didn't apply to that (awful-generic) wine. Ha ha. Gouge much? Anyways, I can't say much about it, we didn't try the food but the dishes we saw being served looked good. The whole experience with the obvious price dishonesty left a poor taste, as did the quality received. 

Something to also note - it's very much a \" young persons\" place, loads of early 20's hipster types conglomerating there. I'm sure they receive $5 drinks, target market."}
{"text":"The food tasted like the cook was pretending to be a great chef. The music was loud (or maybe I am getting old) and the service was so so. I was mostly disappointed in the food though, and when I pay as much as they are asking, I expect something better than greasy fries and bland meat.   There are better places to go for a great meal in this city."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this bar.  It was raining out and it provided a nice respite as we walked through Notre Dame.  I think it's a beautiful bar and I like the way they have the back wall lit up.  They could probably redo other parts of the bar itself. . . the saloon-like oak wood in some areas does not seem to fit the rest of the decor.

The drinks are stiff and the staff is extremely attentive.  For you ladies hitting the town, this is probably an excellent place for you.  Perhaps some of the best looking male bartenders.  Bring your A-game and learn some French."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great location in Old Montreal.

We had an early dinner/late lunch - there was no one in the place so we were worried it was closed.  Although in order to walk through the door, I had to almost physically move 2-3 guys outside smoking directly in the doorway.  This kind of thing makes me crazy, especially because it wasn't snowing/raining, so why they had to hover (and force me to walk through the cloud) in the doorway is bizarre, and really not classy.

However, once inside things were better.  I had the mushroom risotto and it was REALLY good with fresh wild mushrooms.  Yum!  We also started with the appetizer sampler.  The wine was good, service was OK."}
{"text":"Lieu un peu trop bruyant à mon gout mais excellente poutine ! Les cocktails ont l'air top !"}
{"text":"pleasantly surprised by this place! the downtown location and very chic look of the place were intimidating at first. most places are crazy, stupid expensive, all form, less function. but the staff was super friendly, found a great corner booth for our group of 7 and squeezed us in before the reservation party arrived 2 1/2 hours later. the cocktail list is FANTASTIC. extensive, arranged by liquor so you don't have go crazy mixing your poisons (unless you're into that), with classics and their own inventions. i had the old fashioned (delightfully orange and dry, they even asked if i'd like bourbon or rye! - rye, please) and a madame (with bourbon, basil, and grapefruit juice, which everyone else wanted to sip and love on like i did). husband went out of his comfort zone with a sazerac, then ordered another. drinks aren't cheap, but they're well made and healthy sized. we ordered some snacks, a couple of friends ordered proper meals, everyone was pleased. highlights included the grilled veggies (with bok choy, pine nuts, tomatoes, other nice choices), plaintain chips (perfectly crisp, not at all greasy), and the creme brulee, which was unanimously declared the best of all time. greeted again by all the staff on our way out. just goes to show, you can't judge a book by its cover, nor a tapas joint by its shiny clientele."}
{"text":"Honestly this place was fantastic. The servers were very hospitable and helpful. The cocktails were amazing. It was my birthday so my friends and I tried multiple cocktails and all of them were really refreshing and not watered down at all. It was a little loud and if you don't like that dim bar vibe, it's not for you. I love that kind of thing, so it was great. Food was on the pricier side but as I was a tourist visiting it seemed like that was typical of most of the restaurants in that area. 

Pork shoulder was incredible and the Mac and cheese was great too!"}
{"text":"Found at L'assommoir on a weekday evening at around 6, when everything else in the area seemed to be closed. Not only were the doors open, but our party was received with a warm greeting, quick seating, and immediate drink orders. Service was friendly, the waiter asking where we were from and answering our questions about the menu.

I had the crab tartare with avocado, which was lovely in both presentation and flavor. The crab was not over-seasoned, but a perfect mild taste which the avocado and the accompanying pain a l'ail. Everyone else in the party was satisfied with their dishes also, including two who ordered fish and chips. The restaurant took on the palaver of how to serve such a casual dish as fried fish by placing it on a wooden cutting board with tartar sauce smeared on the surface. While the presentation was a bit strange for my taste, those who ordered it enjoyed both presentation and food alike.

Throughout dinner, there was also a lovely atmosphere in the restaurant, a quiet noise level, soft music in the background, and an intimate, yet refined small-room aura. The bar seems popular, and looks worth a return visit to check out."}
{"text":"Really need to reserve ahead! It's quite a busy restaurant (especially on a Friday night)!
For the occasion of Tartare Fest. we came to Assommoir because their price is the most competitive (10$ including a tartare among 3 choices: salmon, beef, \"cerf\" with a choice of wine between red and white). Salmon tartare was so good! Sweet and tender. Beef tartare is rather salty but still quite good. The white wine is quite decent and red wine too. We also ordered fried calamari, which was rather plain.
The service was quite good and the staff is friendly, I would come back again!"}
{"text":"Je continue ma recherche du brunch parfait, et ma quête m'emmène directement à L'assomoir. Ambiance taverne et lumière tamisée, nous voilà devant une carte gourmande à souhait. 
Je craque (encore) sur les oeufs bénédictines (les Béné forestier), mon péché mignon. L'assiette et belle, bien présentée et très copieuse. Les patates rôties sont cuites dans de la graisse de canard : succulentes et fondantes. La sauce hollandaise est crémeuse et goûteuse. Bref, un excellent choix :)
Sans parler des toast de vraie baguette fraîche avec la marmelade maison (délicieuse !!!)
Le café à volonté est toujours apprécié. Service impeccable et agréable. Bref on se sent comme chez des amis ! 

Petit bémol : peut-être un peu trop gras à mon goût, à consommer avec modération :)"}
{"text":"It has an interesting decor when you walk in,  I didn't really expect to find the disco ball hanging right there, over my head.

I didn't really tried any food so I can't judge, I'm sure it's good. The drinks were good too, bit on an expensive side, but then again, it's common for Old Montreal area to have those prices. 

My 3 stars are solid 3 stars and I'm sure I could have probably given more if I liked the vibe of the place, but I'm afraid I didn't really. It just didn't feel like a place I would go with friends, but I guess it's better suited for tourists and 5-7 after work drinks with colleagues. Still, it's worth checking out to see if you like the place for yourself."}
{"text":"I came here during the \"Mtl à table\" festival, a festival that allows foodies to try out new restaurants at a fraction of the price. I was looking forward to this since I've been here before but only to have a drink. I started out with the bison tartare which was very tasty. It's after that that things started to deteriorate. We waited 45 minutes for our main course and when I spotted the waitress with our dishes I said to my friend that we're finally going to eat. Since she was facing the kitchen she said that she hoped not since those plates have been sitting next to the bar for quite a while. Sure enough, those were our plates. My osso bucco was still warm, but she said that her fish was a bit cold. Because we were so famished she didn't say anything. Speaking of my osso bucco, it was bland. There was no seasoning at all. Disappointing. I was really looking forward to the dessert since I love anything sweet. My pudding chomeur consisted of a dry white cake with caramel on top. The cake was so dry that the caramel couldn't even moisten it, which is what it's supposed to do. I've had a better pudding chomeur at rotisserie St-Hubert.

Because this was during the Mtl à table festival, I paid a set price of 39$ for my food. At that price, I felt that it was slightly overpriced for what I got. However had I went any other time, the same meal would've cost me 54$?! That's just insane. There are better and cheaper options nearby. 

Another thing; there are a couple of reviews that mention the loudness of the music. I have to agree with them. Is it necessary to blast music at 6pm? People are eating and we can barely carry on a conversation. Raise the volume at 10pm, but prior to that keep it low."}
{"text":"This was my second visit here in the past couple months. It does have a nice vibe I suppose, but after my latest experience, I will not return.
I went last night around 7:30 pm  with a friend of mine and we got one drink each. The bar was halfway empty and we took up space for about fifteen minutes while we finished our drink, we did not linger nor take space away from any waiting guests.
On the credit card, I left a couple dollars for a tip (keep in mind one drink each) and the bartender right there on the spot decided to shame me for not leaving him enough. Right in front of my company he told me that that was a terrible tip and even in the States that would be bad. I'm not even sure what that meant .
I could go on about the tip amount being okay or not, but whether it was or wasn't he had no right to try and embarrass me in front of my company. It was more than just one snide comment. He really tried to rub in the fact that he was unhappy with my tip.
His name at the bottom of the receipt is Philippe. Try to avoid him unless you want your tip dissected in front of your entire company."}
{"text":"Bon restaurant. On était 6 filles, on a bien profité. Un peu cher mais c'était vaaaaaachement bon. Pour un plateau à partager : 110 $, très juste pour 6 personnes.

Le petit hic est que la musique est un peu forte donc à un moment il est juste impossible de parler a ta copine deux rangs en face de toi."}

C'est la sur de l'Assommoir Bernard, donc les menus des cocktails, vins et bouchées sont les mêmes. Point de vue qualité de la nourriture, j'aime autant l'emplacement à Notre-Dame que celui sur Bernard. C'est une belle réussite qui me permet d'avoir mes plats préférés, peu importe où je me trouve.

Cette fois-ci j'ai essayé quelque chose de nouveau, pour lesquels ils sont reconnus : les tartares. J'ai partagé un tartare de buf avec un ami qui était simplement délicieux. Rempli d'herbes fraîches, le tartre se mangeait très bien avec les biscuits ou bien seul. Il fondait dans la bouche juste comme un tartare devrait.

Allez-y assez tôt, ou bien pensez à faire des réservations. Cet emplacement se remplit vite et à 17h30, on a été chanceux de prendre l'une des dernières tables disponibles."}

Roland & Emerson ont été spectaculaire tout au long de la soirée, fait remarquable avec un si grand groupe. Leur service était examplaire. Leur sourire et professionalisme présent à chaque contact. Ils ont fait de la soirée un moment inoubliable!

La nouriturre était parfaite. De la cuisson des viandes en passant par l'originalité du menu (les plateaux à partager: mmmmmm!!! Quoi dire de leur menu cocktails avec plus de 300 choix!!

{"text":"3.5

Came here for last call and, for a late night bar, I was pretty surprised to see things so empty. Granted, it was a Monday night but closing time seemed to come a wee bit earlier than my local host anticipated. The bar staff was very pleasant to let us have a drink but there was no atmosphere of which to speak. i imagine that in a more populated time, L'Assommoir could be a very fun place. As it was, my experience there was slightly... awkward which was a buzzkill from the fun I was having earlier in the evening. Rather than the perfect place to end the night, LND became the place where the night sort of just... fizzled.

Seeing that it was late and a bit on the cool side, I opted for the Jamaican Espresso: rum, Tia Maria coffee liqueur & cold espresso. There might have been some whipped cream/chocolate action on top. I'm not admitting to anything. The drink was just fine for what it was supposed to be: a dessert nightcap for a late night. The Tia Maria was a bit too bitter for me and even the sugar from the espresso & whipped cream (ugh; admitted) wasn't able to offset it as much as I would have liked. This isn't a drink I'd normally get at a bar but for an after dinner alternative to coffee, it'll do. Sorta. I'd need to come back to LND on a busier night and order a drink drink (maybe some apps as well?) to really get a feel for the type of place it is. As it was, it's a-ok."}
{"text":"Not sure why the hotel sent a 60 year old married guy from out of town to this place for dinner--its clearly catering to local young singles looking to hook-up.  They have a loud obnoxious DJ who plays mostly techno-pop (at very high volume) but also enjoys butchering classics like \"dock of the bay.\"  Seriously disgusting to anyone used to real music.

The food is inventive and I liked what I ordered with the help of the staff.  Maple candied Salmon.  A fairly nice beef dish.  A little maple-infused cake (it is maple season after all).  Even though they sat me out of the main room in a corner the service was actually pretty decent.  The staff was helpful (maybe I reminded them of dear old dad ;-))

So in summary.  Good food.  Atmosphere sucks if you want to relax during your meal."}
{"text":"Great venue cool vibe fun music! The place is a beehive of activity lots of people just standing in the middle of the bar. Drinks are reasonably priced and the service is excellent. Check out the disco balls at the back they are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Came here for late night drinks and apps after traveling to Montreal from NY. The place has a pretty cool ambience-- the back of the bar is lit up, there's high top seating, a huge disco ball, music, and upstairs seating. Seems like the perfect place to come for a light bite or a fun date. We came on a Tuesday night and it was pretty packed. 

Our waitress was very, very nice. She had a lot of suggestions when it came to our drink orders-- I ordered a cosmopolitan and she informed me that she had a previous customer from the US order this drink and was unhappy with it. Apparently the make the cosmos different in Canada, so she directed me to other drinks. I got the Melontini, which was so good (fresh watermelon juice and vodka). My mom got the Santa Maria, which was recommended by our waitress and wasn't on the menu-- she loved it. My dad got a Moscow mule and it was very good. For apps we got the beef cheek pouting and the ceviche. Both were very good. We wanted the oysters (which were selling for a dollar that night) but they were sold out when we got there. 

My only complaint was that, when we ordered our second round of drinks, the bar took SOOOO LONG to make them. We probably waited 15-20 minutes for them, and the table next to us were complaining about the slow service as well. In the meantime, we saw the bartenders taking shots with friends instead of making the drinks. Besides that, I recommend coming here for a late night bite or drinks. Their food and drink menus are extensive and the waitress was lovely."}
