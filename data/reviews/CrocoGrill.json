{"text":"My experience only covers their poutines.... and WHAT A POUTINE IT IS!!!  For a mere $9.99, you get a huge poutine that simply brightens your day, clears your sinuses, reveals to you the meaning of life... and then give you that awesome happy nap mere minutes after you finish indulging yourself on this masterpiece from Crocogrill.   A huge poutine with tasty house potatoes, gravy that's just right, a generous portion of premium smoked meat for less than $10?  YES PLEASE.  Delivery can be arranged online without issue and they are quick and effective.   When I want a poutine, I know where to go!  The other stuff, don't know... don't care...  THE POUTINE IS INSANELY GOOD. :)"}
{"text":"Mal pris, pause du midi, pressé, c'est le resto le plus près de moi.   Je commande le cheeseburger et frites. Worst burger ever. Le pain était sec. Moi, la grande mangeuse, enceinte, ai laissé la moitié de mon burger. Sans que ce soit un burger décadent, il me semble qu'il soit facile d'avoir un pain frais et une viande passable dans un delicatessen. Je n'avais pas de hautes attentes, mais il y a des limites pour une assiette à 15$. Les frites sont bonnes par contre, mais pourquoi service du ketchup froid?"}
{"text":"My friend Jason M used to rave about the poutine here so I had to go check it out. Entering Crocogrill into my Waze app I came here with my wife one evening and actually drove by the place. You see Crocco Grill is in the main floor of a commercial building. Not what I was expecting. Total Jason type of place. Small restaurant tucked away in a building that you would have no clue where it was unless you had some good restaurant searching skills.   The first thing my wife and I noticed was that the clientele who were coming in had mostly white/grey hair and what one person once described to me as the \"cottonball\" hair effect. I was telling myself that's okay older people may have a thing to know where some good food is to be found.   I ended up ordering  a cheeseburger with small poutine which also came with Caesar salad. The salad was nothing special some chopped romaine and Caesar dressing that looked like it was just poured out of a big container of Kraft dressing. The burger was noticibly better but again the meat patty lacked a bit of seasoning. The poutine was quite a bit better. A rich brown gravy sauce and a good amount of cheese curds. I let my wife taste it and her conclusion (and I agree) is that the fries tasted a bit soggy. They tasted like they were cooked in old oil. Maybe it was not a great visit. I'm willing to try it again however my visit left me yearning for a bit more."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with some friends and we all ordered the Croco burger. I decided to start with an appetizer so I ordered the nacho plate, What a disappointing and sad looking plate!!!  I posted a pic so you guys can see what they are selling for 8$, it was just a plate of burnt chips and a super lackluster amounts of cheese, even when the waitress gave it to me she had a face of shame on her, It also took 45 min to make the nachos, I don't understand how it even took that long. Good thing is they took it back when I told them how disappointed I was and she did not charge me for it. Another bad thing is we got almost no service, my friend wanted water and no waiters was to be found till they brought our food. The only reason why they even got 2 stars is because the burger was all right. The first time a friend brought me a burger from this place a few months ago was way better but it was still fine this time. If you want to eat at Croco grill skip the nachos and go for the poutine or burgers or skip this place all together, I'm going to give them one more try for the poutine..... Made my own nacho plate at home and I am going to upload it to show them how a noob like me can make a better plate for less then what they charge."}
