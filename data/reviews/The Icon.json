{"text":"Icon, you've left me speechless--and not in a good way.  Luckily, I can still write!

I have been coming here for years, and I adore the Iconic tapas...particularly anything involving short ribs or flank steak.  Or flatbreads.  Somehow, it has always slipped my mind to yelp about this place. So it's very IRONIC that last night, when I visited with the full intention of remedying that oversight, Icon fell flat on its face.

I'm incredibly cranky about this whole experience, and I am not going to pull any punches.  Here's how it went down.  I signed myself and my sister up for the Valentine's day prix fixe menu.  $48 per plate.  4 courses.  ICON.  Money well spent, right? WRONG!  I had issues with EVERY course.  Not to mention that we had our coats on for the entire meal to ward off the arctic blasts each time the door opened.  

Now, I have to say that I went against my better judgement, which tells me to avoid seafood in the Midwest.  However, it WAS featured prominently on a very expensive menu, so I thought what the hell?  I bit: I went with the crab cakes in the first course.  They made me want to jump the first plane to Maryland so I could remind myself what good crab cakes taste like.  The crab had that distinctive frozen flavor (that you wouldn't expect in a high-end establishment).  The cakes were otherwise dense and semi-gross.  But I dug the saffron aioli...for whatever that's worth. 

For the second course, I chose the CREAM OF asparagus soup.  I can't stress this enough: any chef should be embarrassed by what we were served.  I emphasize \"cream of,\" because the soup clearly had not been uniformly pur√©ed and strained, as evidenced by the occasional spoonful of overcooked asparagus chunks.  Moreover, the soup was crying out for salt--which was notably absent from our table.  Really? REALLY?!

THIS IS BASIC STUFF, PEOPLE.  

For the entree I chose lobster pappardelle, which was okay, but not memorable.  My sister picked the standout of the meal: the porcini and truffle ravioli was fantastic, and I would have licked her plate if nobody else had been in the room. 

And dessert? I opted for the chocolate mousse.  The presentation was a curious cross between something my puppy would have done and liver pate with birthday candles.  I did venture a taste, and it was fine--but again, not memorable.  I didn't detect the cardamom.

So in short, I am pissed that I spent $48 per plate for a meal that was poorly executed.

So, Icon...maybe I'll be back someday.  Maybe I'll write a glowing update.  But right now, I just don't see it."}
{"text":"It was our first night in Madison, and I wasn't overly hungry, so this is exactly the kind of place we were looking for.  Everything we ordered was straight-up phenomenal, but first, I want to rave about the service, because it was excellent.  Although we ordered 2 dishes at a time, they were delivered one by one, which was perfect - more than one dish would have been crowded for the tiny 2-seat table.  Pacing of the dishes and drinks?  Perfect.  I have some dietary restrictions that always leave me asking a lot of questions and making special requests;  the server was helpful, friendly, never made me feel like I was putting her out, and brought me plain bread when I needed to have some.

But now, the food.

We started with the anchovies, which were fantastic;  as my partner pointed out, they're difficult to do well, but these were done VERY well.  The description on the menu doesn't remotely do them justice.  Savory, salty deliciousness, with a touch of creamy garlic aioli.

Next:  piquillo peppers, stuffed with a colorful mix of roasted vegetables, and served on a bed of Israeli couscous salad.  Not only was it very tasty, but it was substantial enough to have served as a light lunch on its own, at a mere $6.

Third: serrano-wrapped sea scallops, with an orange pineapple vinaigrette.  I am not a scallop-lover;  I often find them rubbery.  These were perfectly-cooked and absolutely superb.

Fourth:  No way were we NOT trying the grilled lamb, and it was every bit as fantastic as previous reviewers have said.  Cooked perfectly rare, garnished with a port reduction - wonderful.  I couldn't eat the accompanying manchego potato gratin, but I was told that it was decadent.

Everything else sounded so good that we undoubtedly would have eaten more if we possibly could have.  Cocktails and wine selection were also fantastic.  The prices are a bargain, for the quality of food, compared to what we're used to in Boston.  The decor and ambiance is quirky, not elegant, and it is a bit crowded, even when the place isn't full.  But we thought it was a fun, funky place to grab a bite (or four!), and we loved it!"}
{"text":"Food was awful. So many better places to go in madison! The crostini they serve with many of the dishes looked and tasted like they were bought at Costco or SAMs club.  They do have a decent wine list -so maybe just go for drinks."}
{"text":"I was here recently with 4 friends after an Overture show.  The food was quite good, at least what we ate of it.  On a few occasions the server cleared the plates when there was still food on them.  The worst part of our experience was out waiter.  One woman is 8 months pregnant and ordered an mojito without rum.  The waiter looked at her with the most confused look and said \"so, you want it with vodka then?\".  She finally got it through to him that she wanted it without alcohol.  So then our bill came and we were charged $11 for this virgin mojito (the normal price with alcohol).  We asked him about this charge and he stated that there was no button for this drink without alcohol and the charge was for the mint and the labor.  We asked him to check with a manager, we waited 10 minutes and no manager came to our table.  So, we paid and left....angry."}
{"text":"The menu reads well (not classic tapas, I agree) and the presentation is good  but the execution and flavors are lacking.  With the anchovies appetizer, we only tasted mayonnaise; with the ahi tuna tartare, only tasted olive brine; with the jamon flatbread, microwaved cheese.  The service was excellent but I am sorry to say, we ordered the right quantity of food to fill us but it did not taste like anything going down."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with the experience through and through. To sum it up, I don't think that the atmosphere (I'm thinking music and decor) went particularly well together or with the menu. Our server that night was mousey and awkward and took our menus before we were ready to be done ordering...then tried to say that she left a menu and it must have fallen...into thin air? not cool. Finally, the hot tapas were'nt hot they were luke warm and just ok."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant.  Amazing.  Upscale,  comfortable venue,  and Tuesday Tapas night is the time to go. .. $3.95 tapas choices,  $2.95 for the most amazing sangrias ever made,  and $1.95 for bottled Spanish beer,  even gluten-free.  Out of all of our choices,  the hands-down favorite was the bacon-wrapped dates, not on special.  I'm still thinking about them,  planning when I can revisit and have them again!"}
{"text":"I ate here the other night while craving tapas, and thought the place had delightful potential with its classic film theme. It was okay. Not particularly bad, just nothing particularly redeeming that would make me go back. 
I also may be spoiled and used to variety of dishes on a Chicago tapas menus, but was quite surprised and disappointed when they didn't even have paella. 
My husband and I both thought the lamb meatballs were good, and enjoyed the tomato bread but agreed the dish would have been better if the bread were toasted. The gazpacho was over blended and not very good, we only ate a few bites of it before giving up on the dish.The mussels were very neatly plated, and okay, maybe a bit salty, but with virtually no broth for dipping! That's my favorite part of steamed mussels. 
The not particularly good food was also echoed in the drinks. My husband had a Manhattan (relabeled an Ocean's 11) that he said \"had too much vermouth.\""}
{"text":"I was introduced to the Icon by my roommate, and we love to go to this downtown spot, until they stopped having tapas happy hour a while back. The tapas have been a highlight of our visit. Due to their small sizes you get to sample a variety of different food even though it was only two of us. 

I like their empadanas (crispy puffs!!), stuffed mushrooms, fries and desserts! Plenty to try and they also have a full menu in addition to the tapas which you can order from, in which both hot and cold dishes are served.

We have always had good service on our visits, and the ambience is great. Located just opposite the overture center, it is a good place to go for a snack before an evening show or pop by for some drinks after. It's dimly lit but you could still see what is in front of you. However, their pricing is not exactly cheap, especially now that tapas happy hour are no longer being offered. I wish they would bring that back since it's been a while now."}
{"text":"This is my third visit to Icon.  This time I was by myself so sat at the bar and had a dinner of tapas and wine - lots of choices by the glass.  The Spanish Albarino was great, the Argentinian Sauv Blanc not so.  Many choices of well made tapas with some creativity.  Try the white anchovies with almond pesto.  There are two TV screens discreetly showing old movies (without sound) so watched an old \"singing cowboy\" western from 1936 while dining.  Very fun.  Friendly, smart staff."}
{"text":"Icon has a retro feel to it. We really love this place and the tapas and sangrias are worth it! We have been visiting this place for years and this place never disappoints. The only downside is that on certain days this place can get really crowded (especially, if there is an event/show at Overture). The tables are stacked next to each other and it can get really noisy and uncomfortable if you have 'close' neighbors invading your personal space. This place is heavenly on days when it's not as busy with classic songs and movie playing in the background."}
{"text":"Nice variety, good atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Ambience is good. That's about it. Service is below average.  Food is subpar. Very small portion. Salad looks so tired and tastes tired. Meat is too rough to be chewable. Even fried calamari is unchewable.  Disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I'm being nice with the 2 stars. This is STRICTLY for the Sangria. It taste just like they make it in Spain! I really thought this place would be great w/ the reviews and all, however, me and the bf left extremely disappointed. As a matter if fact, we left hungry :( The order: Scallops $12, two small piece for the cost, and they were spoiled! The smell of the is still lingering in my nostrils. I can't even describe the odor with out being graphic about unwashed female parts. Gross. Patas Bravas- these were meh. Tasted more like baked potatoes dipped in Hooters wing sauce. A bit like dry fries that were sitting under the warming lamp for a bit. Rack of lamb?! I HARDLY call it that for 13$. Do NOT waste your money. It was more like one piece of very, VERY bland lamb. Did you ever hear of seasoning?! Supposedly, they have a \"chef\" um, I'm doubting that very much... I do believe that untrained cooks could have done better. You can see for yourself, however, save yourself the $100, spoiled scallops, and a stomach ache. 
Good idea, bad execution, and even worse food. The ONLY plus is the Sangria. I was also nice about the scallops AFTER we paid the bill I let our server know, and you guessed it..our server had nothing to say. I guess I don't blame him for the lack of care in his service seeing as it was a slow Wednesday night. I will not go back & the bf will not recommend the Icon it to his UW coworkers. Sorry Icon. Not at all Iconic in our book. Now that I think about it-it should be one star. I can not emphasize how much you should just skip this place and grab a sandwich and a coffee next door as we did following our so called dinner."}
{"text":"First off I have to say the food was really great.  I would go back for that in a second.  However, the service was awful.  My friends and arrived about 1.5 hours before closed.  The entire time the waiter seemed to be annoyed that we were in there.  He must have had other things to do.  It was a Sunday, but there were also other people in there.  The entire time he was frank, short, and very unpleasant.  We felt like we were putting him out.  All of us have waited tables at some point and we would have understood the attitude if we had walked in a half hour prior to close.  But we didn't.  Yes the waiter took away the dishes when we were done.  But, he also would just put a tapa plate down annoyingly and walk away and take plates away before we were even finished.  Also when they \"ran\" out of a sauce for one of the desserts, he didn't even tell us until we brought it up.  Then he brought us a cold glob of caramel and didn't even apologize.  It was the rudest service I've had in a long time.  I could tolerate it if it was a cheaper restaurant but not at an mid to expensive restaurant.  It will take a lot of convincing to have me go back again."}
{"text":"Swanky place, good atmosphere & food, right in the heart of Madison's cultural center. A great place to meet friends for food & drinks, even catch the game @ the bar."}
{"text":"We arrived here about 30 minutes before the concert, we told the gentleman we are in kind of a rush, he suggested some food one was tuna tartare, watermelon salad, calamari, Spera guess, and the food was absolutely fantastic.

We also got the braised short ribs that was more than fantastic.

I would never hesitate to send anybody to this restaurant as the food was great and the service was stupendous."}
{"text":"The quality was pretty good but the portions were tiny (even for tapas) for the price that they charge for it.. 10$ for a small plate that is sub par.. And included four pieces of meat that were the size of a quarter.. Not worth it!"}
{"text":"I am spanish and was looking for a good tapas bar to remember the taste of home. Unfortunately, I found the icon a bit underwhelming. I was not expecting to walk right into a restaurant in the middle of Madrid and fully understand that some ingredients are hard/impossible to get, however, I was expecting more from this place. 
I like the style but found it to be quite uncomfortable for a party larger than two. 
Will probably give it another try at some point."}
{"text":"Went there on date-night before a concert at the Overture
First- you may have read online that you get discount if you have tickets from overture. BUT the discount only applies if you go AFTER the concert and not before it. 
Second, their bacon-wrapped dates are the best on the menu. 
Third: Avoid duck breasts as they are below average. We also had egg-plant frites and Asparagus which are ok. 
Tres-leches is a bit over-sweet and comes colored with weird pink stuff. Maybe get their bread-pudding. 
Expensive for tapas. 

Lastly, tables are too close to each other for having a comfortable conversation, date-night."}
{"text":"I had passed by Icon several times with the intent of visiting before actually having the opportunity too.  The first was on Halloween night.  As slightly-older-than-college-age persons, my friend and I picked here to rest our feet a bit and have a drink.  Best decision ever.  We had the apple sangria and I had the stuffed mushrooms and dessert.  Simply amazing.  We dubbed it our go-to place for nicer nights out.

I've been there numerous times now, and among all companions, have probably sampled 90% of the menu.  All have been amazing, both in taste and presentation.  I admit I have not tried a drink other than the apple sangria.  Normally, I change things up.  But I dream about it.  Therefore I order it.

If you are the type of person who enjoys good food, good drinks, and good atmosphere, try it out.  You won't be disappointed.  If you are hung up on labels (this is not traditional tapas, which they don't claim to be anyway), just try to clear your mind of that and focus on what really matters at a restaurant.  Again, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went on a weeknight and the place was nearly completely empty. I've certainly had better tapas, but you can't go too terribly wrong with the baked goat cheese and fried calamari here. The waiter recommended the Marilyn's Cosmo as the most popular cocktail, but it was pretty mediocre. Still, the staff are friendly, the food is decent, and the decor is pleasant."}
{"text":"This somewhat non-traditional tapas bar is perhaps our favorite place for a glass of wine (or a bottle) and some light dishes after a concert or a play, as long as we don't have to wait to get in.

On our most recent visit, we shared a bottle of Malbec and four plates: baked goat cheese, cured Spanish meats, a crab cake, and the beef carpaccio. Each are excellent in their own way, and I can particularly recommend all of them.  We always seem to order three of them -- goat cheese, crab cake, carpaccio -- whenever we visit, and then round out the order with whatever strikes us at the time.

The service is always excellent, no matter the time of day or how busy they are. The wine list is decent and the cocktails are well-made.

The only real downside (besides an increasingly light wallet) is that when it gets busy, the waits get very long and there's no good place for those waiting to stand, other than around the single door (and in the winter, not having a double door can get a bit chilly if you're sitting near the front of the house). We won't wait to get a table or a seat at the bar, but that's just because there are many other great bars and restaurants in downtown Madison."}
{"text":"Been waiting 45 minutes to get offered any food at a tapas place. So my buddies Spanish grandma would have had bread, olive oil, olives, cheese and bragged just a little about one of his favorites that was next. Man bun doesn't quite get that. Just saying"}
{"text":"So this place liked incredible. The vibe is cool, menu sounds good, appears to be well designed. The service SUCKED! I literally waited while they stood around doing nothing to order. The food was subpar. Do not go here."}
{"text":"Went to Icon with  6 others and tried all kinds of things.  From scallops to flatbread, to short ribs.  Everything was good, if not great.  Pitchers of peach & mango sangria to go around the table.  The short ribs were falling off the bone.  The chocolate mousse and the fried banana were an awesome end.  We ate and drank our fill, and when split amongst 7 people, I couldn't believe the bill was actually lower than I'd anticipated.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Was in Madison for a wedding which did not have alcohol being served (not even a cash bar) so after the wedding we wanted to find a nice place to grab a few drinks. We found a lot of bars along state street but they were all mostly grungy. We were looking for something upscale (we were all dressed up so wanted to go to a classy joint with some top-shelf liquor). 

Luckily we spotted the Icon on the walk back (we had completely missed it on the first walk down State street). It looked quite trendy from the outside so we decided to check it out and we were so happy we did. 

The decor was very chic and classy, the crowd too was a little dressy and upscale so we fit right in. The bartenders were extremely attentive and prompt (a rarity in most bars) as well as extremely helpful (I wanted directions to a place and the bartender took me right out of the bar onto the street to explain the directions). 

They had a very good selection of wines both by the bottle and by the glass. I am a single-malt scotch drinker and they had the real absolute top-shelf stuff so needless to say I was thrilled. I had a laphroaig 10 followed by a lagavulin 16 followed by a Macallan 18 ... just perfect. I really wanted to go for the Macallan 25 next (which BTW I have rarely seen being served at a bar) but I didn't want to turn a night-cap into a nite-binge ;-) ... and more importantly the price on that drink was $95. :-)

Must say, this one was a great find during our trip to Madison. I would certainly go back there if I happen to visit Madison again."}
{"text":"Great bar with a very classy feel. Won't find an immature crowd here. Intimate feel with great martinis and cocktails. Also a few good tap beers.  Employees are knowledgeable and have a neat appearance with black shirts and red ties. There is also a good variety of music that's not so loud that you can't have a good conversation. Capitol Bar-esque feel but on state street."}
{"text":"It was completely empty on a Friday night. We did get our drinks right away, but the atmosphere was kind of a let down.  The 80s hair band music didn't seem to match the motif. They did not have food available, so we had one drink and headed someplace else instead. I may try again sometime in the future to see if it was just an off night."}
{"text":"Great place to meet friends. The have a lot of options on the menu. Try the lamb chops."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good option for State St. The sangria is tasty--and half price on Thursdays! 

Happily for us, we wandered in on a Thursday. The sangria was a little sweet for my taste, but still okay. 

The service was quite good and very well paced. The server helped us order the right amount of food and was very good about bringing new plates, etc. when asked. 

We ordered plenty of food for 4 people, some vegetarians, some not, and a pitcher of sangria, and the bill was quite reasonable. 

I gave it three stars because I've been to some really terrific tapas bars, and this was good, but not great. Still, it's a nice choice for downtown, and the noise level isn't so insane that you can't have a conversation."}
{"text":"Wondering where to get a dirty (vodka) martini with sweet vermouth?  At The Icon of course!  Now you're probably confused because everyone knows dirty martini's are made with DRY vermouth.  And yes, a martini with sweet vermouth is just as disgusting as it sounds.

The food was decent, service was decent, atmosphere was \"interesting\" - I think this is a once and done place for me though.  Nothing about it screamed \"come again!\""}
{"text":"Do. Not. Go. Here. Never in my life have I had such a poor working experience. The kitchen is basically a hot, dirty closet. When we would run out of rags during a rush (yes, that's right. They never had more than one bag on hand) the kitchen staff were told to \"deal with it.\" 

     There is a single restroom, which kitchen staff are forbidden from using. We are told to use the basement \"bathrooms\" instead, which are littered with toilet paper and other filth. Not to mention that the stalls of said slime pits do not have doors (very inconvenient for a waitress that might want some privacy to change in or out of work clothes with a bunch of men around). 

     During the miserable time I worked here, I made a point to inform one of the managers that I wouldn't be available for the weekend shifts a few weeks away for a college campus tour. To which the oaf replied \"That's not my problem.\" I'm also quite sure the owner sexually harassed female employees. 

     In an act of what I assume was hazing, I was instructed to mop the quarter-inch layer of grime off of the walk-in cooler floor. Fun of it was, the only source of water in the basement is a small hand-washing station across the room. You can imagine how that one played out. 

     But I think the best thing about this trash heap excuse for a restaurant would have to be, upon clocking out for the night, I was informed that I wasn't aloud at the bar. When I inquired as to why, I was told it was because another employee had gotten belligerent one night at that same bar. Who do you ask? The fucking GM. Fuck this place, and fuck the higher-ups that treat their employees like worthless pawns."}
{"text":"Great location for tapas and drinks before or after a show at the Overture! I went here with one other prior to seeing Wicked; they had funny sounding cocktails to match the show. I passed as they sounded somewhat sweet and disturbing but cute. Ordered Spanish white wines (good, fairly priced), baked goat cheese (minimal goat cheese, lots of tomato sauce and garlic bread), pork belly with fruit and peppers (seemed to be pork tenderloin, nothing similar to pork belly, small portion), salmon in puff pastry (very good, quite rich!), and asparagus (delish, potent lemon). I had previously only been here around bar close; clearly different approach at that time. Only downside were the prices and serving sizes (yes, I do know it's tapas); luckily you can choose to spend $4 or $25/item (approx.). They do accept reservations."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here before the play Wicked at the Overture Center.  Had the stuffed pizza and two glasses of wine.  The food was ok, but was really disappointed withe the small poor on the wine.  I'm guessing it  was 3, maybe 4 oz at best.  What is is with restaurants these days that charge you $10 for a glass of wine and then don't even give you 5 oz.  I mean, really?   How cheap can you be.  Won't be going back.  Note to The Icon.  Don't be so cheap.  How much does an extra oz or two of wine cost you?"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why it's taken me so long to eat here, but long row two table seating makes it a good space for a date night. We ordered the zucchini fries and patatas bravas...not a great pairing, way too fried and bland. I wasn't thrilled with the tapas menu options. 

The decor was a little kitschy for me too. It's somewhat confusing to market being a Spanish tapas restaurant with silver screen decor, but maybe I'm too traditional in my tapas restaurant expectations. 

Out waitress was attentive and pleasant. Nothing really stood out for me about this place, apart from proximity to other cool places on state street. I'm sure the outdoor patio seating would be nice."}
{"text":"I had a WONDERFUL experience going here.  I was worried when we got there because I had tried to call and get a reservation and got no answer.  The host said that they had 70 voicemails waiting for them when they opened.  Luckily, they managed to fit us in at the bar which was fine with us.  It wasn't full when we sat down and the bartender was very attentive.  We started with cocktails and I was impressed with their cocktail menu.  It was hard to pick just one!  Our plan going in was to order a couple plates each and try each others dishes.  We tried the beef, chicken, and spinach/mushroom empanadas, potato croquets, chicken skewers and the beef tenderloin (which was the BEST dish of the night, but maybe not worth $16 for portion size?)  Overall, I was very happy with the price vs. portion size.  There also wasn't a long wait for the food. 
Even though they had a full restaurant by the end of our meal, I didn't feel like we were rushed out of the place.  I loved the decor, I loved the food, I loved the service.  I will definitely be back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend recently on a Saturday night.  As a big lover of tapas, I was very excited to see The Icon appear on State Street this fall.  The wine list was superb...and the \"half-priced bottles\" special on Wednesdays would, alone, certainly bring me back for a second visit.  (Try the Trapiche Estate Pinot Noir from Argentina - delish! Especially on a cold winter's night.)  The food, however, was a bit of a disappointment.  To me, tapas should be a small portion, yes...yet, they are meant to shared with others.  The Icon kitchen must think differently.  For example, the beef empanada is just that - \"a\" beef empanada, a \"small\" beef empanada.  While most of the portions were small...there was inconsistency.  For example, the goat cheese tapa (an all-time favorite of mine) and the flatbreads were large enough to share with several others, but everything else just created awkward splitting.  Also, the tables are sooooo close together - close enough to flick your neighbor's forehead.  On yet another sour note, the raspberry on our pear tart was covered in mold.  The waitress stated she was appauled but did nothing to show it, as in she just let it sit at our table, allowing us to continue to stare at it.  However, things ended on the positive, as she allowed us to take our second, unfinished bottle of wine home. Again, kudos to the wine, boohiss to the food! :)"}
{"text":"This was possibly the worst tapas place I've ever been to...highly disappointed in everything we tried.  The fried calamari was cold and soggy.  The bacon wrapped chicken was ok.. The ceviche lacked flavor.  The best thing we had was the mash potatoes that accompanied the beef... Unless you are just up for drinks avoid this place!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible!  Why?!:  Loud, served COLD mussels, unapologetic/indifferent waitstaff.... 

Will. Not. Be. Back."}
{"text":"The first time my friends and I ever entered this establishment was on a Thursday evening when they still had their half-price Tapas specials.  The Elvis and James Dean prints, black-white movies playing on the TVs, and wall-of-wine made for a very promising first impression.
Apparently though, our waitress was just as new to the establishment as we were, as we soon found ourselves reading the flyer we picked up (at the front, on our way in) to the waitress to explain what the special for that evening was.

The general trend thereafter seemed to be reboots of the same clueless wait staff, episodes of standing at the front door for up to 10 minutes to be seated, and:

The absolutely worst bartender you will ever encounter.
-This is a man who, once you pay for your drink in cash, will hand you your change, and come back around when you are talking with someone, to ask: \"Are you going to pay for that drink?\"  In the most accusational tone someone in that state of employ could muster.
 You better hope it's not someone you need to impress.

-This is the same man who will drink from a round of birthday shots (that wasn't supposed to include him, but he poured it for himself anyway), charge you for it, and then thirty minutes later that evening threaten to take away your beer if you don't finish it before closing time, with the kicker \"Do you want to test me?\"

This little 'hole on State St. basically epitomizes the Hollywood that we know:  Glitz, glamour, and an absolutely vapid lack of any substance thereafter.

Alright, so there _is_ a reason that this place still gets two stars (instead of one) after repeatedly embodying bouts of Gigli, Matrix Reloaded, and Star Wars EP123, and that's the food:

Even without the (self-educated) half-price discount, the tapas are actually quite  tasty, and worth their price.  Especially the creamier options such as the goat cheese and anything with their aioli.  The hiring philosophy for the back of the house must differ quite a bit from that of the front.

I guess to sum it up:  If you're a student going on a first date with no transport to anywhere not walkable, no funds for anything on the 'Square, and a date that only cares about yummy fingerfoods, then this is an excellent excuse to dress semi-formal and start the night.  Otherwise?  Be prepared to spend the rest of your evening wondering how these people haven't been fired years ago."}
{"text":"I think my real rating would be more like a 3.5, but since I can't do that, I'll err toward the better side.

Our server, lemme say, was GREAT - funny, nice, very available, very helpful in menu recommendations/wine selection/reminding us of upcoming specials, etc. I'm pretty sure his name was Travis, but I won't make any promises.  Anyway - he was very friendly & definitely a pro.

The menu was extensive - there would definitely be something for even the pickiest of eaters.  I'm not a tapas expert, my boyfriend wouldn't call himself an \"expert\" but he knows a lot more than me, and he seemed to think the menu was great, too.

I'm not big on seafood (with the exception being, of course, fish fry - I AM from Wisconsin after all! :D), so we had the short ribs that our server recommended, the chicken croquettes, the goat cheese, the artichoke & fennel salad, and then we had the chorizo flatbread.  I couldn't resist dessert, I ordered the pear tart & the truffle cake.

MOST of the food we got was excellent, the only complaints I have are 1) in regards to the desserts.  The ice cream on one tasted freezer burned to me, which was a total buzzkill, and the other one, the tart seemed kind of frozen, ((but the cake & the tart were soooo good that it ALMOST made up for it.)) and 2) the portions were super small for what they were charging.  We've eaten tapas in Boston & paid less for bigger portions, which is surprising, because Boston's usually a pretty expensive city.  BUT the food was great :D

They also have $15 bottles of wine on Wednesday nights, which we were happy to take advantage of :D.  We decided later that it's a pretty good gimmick - cuz for the two of us we spent over $70 on dinner, way more than we usually would have for a non-special occasion - so if you can get people in by lowering the wine price, so be it!  We left happy.

The decor in there is spectacular, although there's not a lot of space.  I was kind of disappointed that on a Wednesday night we had a table seated right next to us and we were elbow to elbow and practically sharing conversations with one another the whole time.  But it's not like there was anywhere else to put them, the place was relatively full for a Wednesday.  Space on State St. is at a premium, so I'm not surprised that the place is pretty small, and you've gotta serve as many people as possible in order to pay that rent, so I don't begrudge them that.  

The moral of the story is, I'd definitely go back for drinks, dessert, appetizers, but I don't know if I'd go back for dinner, just because of the cost/portion size thing."}
{"text":"I have never eaten here, but if you are looking for a bar on a Saturday night that's not packed, you can go to icon. They suprisingly have tons of drink options, and the bar is cool too. It would never be my top choice, but if you stop here you can hear your friends talk :)."}
{"text":"HUGE fan. I tried The Icon yesterday for the first time, and was thrilled at ALL elements, quality of food, preparation, menu creativity, decor, service, drinks... everything was exceptional, and on a slow Sunday evening just before they were closing too. Upscale decor makes for a romantic venue for two, but also a fun venue for hipsters. I can highly recommend the seafood croquettes, the fried calamari, the beef empanada and the stuffed mushrooms. All were generous portions for the price. Our server was class on a stick, she knew the menu well and had great suggestions for drinks without ever being pushy or pretentious. I will be back for CERTAIN."}
{"text":"We had reservations for Saturday evening before the Phantom show at the Overture.  When we arrived there was no record of our reservations.  The greeter immediately talked with others, found us a table, and had us seated in a few minutes. Restaurant was packed, so finding us a table was a major accomplishment.  Our waitress was personable, offering her recommendations, expressing enthusiasm about some of our selections, and making us feel special.  The food was great, but it was the efforts and attitude of the staff that made what could have been a very bad experience into a thoroughly enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"I would give this place another star if not for the service. It wasn't bad, just wasn't very good either.

Came here with a large group of girls for a couple of birthdays. We made a reservation and the table was ready for us when we got there. Our waitress came to take our drink order and just did not seem very interested in us or being there at all. Kind of a turn off. The drinks we ordered were all very good, especially the mojito!

For food I ordered the duck tenders and potato croquettes. The duck tenders came out first and were actually very good. You get quite a few pieces and they were nice and crispy. Then, I waited for the rest of my table to get all of their food, and then about 10 minutes extra for the waitress to realize that my croquettes never came. I notified her that I was still waiting and she said it must have been a kitchen mistake. It then took another 10-15 minutes for them to come out. They were very good, and I didn't get to enjoy them because I was the only one left eating and everyone else wanted to get going. Other people at our table really enjoyed their food, too.

So food is great. Service not so much. I would definitely give them another try, though."}
{"text":"Let's start with the fact that I've only ever been here after 11:30pm for their $5 martinis.

Of their $5 drinks, I like the strawberries+champagne and the champagne. A lot of the chocolate drinks are just a little too sweet for me. Last time I went, some of my friends ordered food from the tapas menu. They got the zucchini fries, the stuffed pepper and a beef empanada. They looked good enough that I'd like to come back and actually try dinner sometime.

I also feel the need to write about the bathrooms. They're very nice. This is a huge plus in my mind. Also, they are single bathrooms, which means that when the ladies' room is taken, I can just go in the men's. Make sure the door is locked though, or it can be really awkward!

Service: Waiters have always been good about checking in to see if we need more drinks, but otherwise they leave us alone (which is totally acceptable).
Environment: It's always been quite empty whenever I've gone. Though I hear it can be packed. It feels like it's trying really hard to be trendy, with a very minimal, red, black and white decor. They play old movies on the TVs"}
{"text":"Service was ok. Took a while to be noticed and get seated. Would have ordered a second drink but our server rarely returned. Cocktails were delicious. The food was ok. Overly rich and over flavored. The paella was oddly creamy and oily. As a paella lover it was very odd and not at all what I was expecting. Paella is also a bit smaller than expected for the price."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service and food.
Great place to meet friends and enjoy a great cocktail.
I loved Mattt as our bartender.  Travis  the Manager made sure  we had a great experience.  He checked on us three times !   The food was spectacular!"}
{"text":"---Tuesday Night Specials review!---
4 of us headed on over to Icon after work last night. We got there at like 7:30 and stayed until maybe 8:30? We left, still partially hungry but had an okat time.

-The interior is pretty sweet, the music cycles through American hits, mostly from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, everything is well-kept, the lighting is cool, the decor is stylish, and the temperature was hovering at a perfect level, despite the cold air outside and price of heating. ;)

-Our waitress was cool: fun, humorous, checked in often, but NOT overattentive. She gave solid food advice (even though we sometimes disregarded it... and wished we hadn't, haha!)



---What We Ordered--- 
(Note that the Tapas Tuesday $5 plate deal doesn't apply to their regular tapas menu. They have special menus of alternate items. Don't plan on scoring one of their Octopus tapas plates or Crab Cakes. We were upset by this.)

Peach Sangria Pitcher ($14) - YUM! Great sangria and we got about 8 full glasses out of it.

\"Duck Tortilla\"  ($5, also $5 on late night menu) - I really liked it, though there weren't any tortillas used in the recipe, to my knowledge. It was more like a shredded duck and spinach fritatta. Moderately sized, compared to the rest. Would totally order again!

\"Grilled Steak Skewers\" and \"Grilled Chicken Skewers\" ($5 each, TT exclusive) - These were very tasty, but the serving size was lousy. Don't order. Not worth the price.

\"Zuchinni Fries\" ($5 on TT, normally $6) - Recommended. Pretty pleased

\"Bacon & Bleu Potato Skins\" ($5, TT exclusive) - Get this! Its basically potato chips, but thicker, less crispy, topped with bacon, cheese, and an excess of jalapeno aoili. Good size, too!

\"Roast Chicken Empanada ($5, normally $6) - Tasty, great sauce, very moist, half recommend it.


Recap: Good place to be entertained, grab a snack, or do a pitcher of sangria. Not a great place to fill up. More expensive than expected. (and I'm still upset that http://theiconmadison.com/specials/ doesn't warn you the special only includes a few of their smaller \"run-o-the-mill\" tapas plates.)"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the food and the price. 
I came here in a group of 5 as part of the epic recruit program, and dinner for 5 comes down to $180 including tax and tip - and we each had 2~3 items! we shared most of the plates and left really stuffed. 

Plates I recommend: 
mushroom soup with blue cheese toast (excellent!)
bacon wrapped sea scallop (best plate of the night)
spicy potato with hot dipping sauce (surprisingly good)

interesting plates:
baked goat cheese
duck breast with cranberry & sweet potato
artichoke & sun dried tomato flatbread

slightly disappointed:
beef tenderloin (the asparagus was great, but the blue cheese on top of meat is just unnecessary)
tuna tartare (overly seasoned, can't really taste the tuna, definitely had better ones)


but all and all, great service, great ambiance, great dining experience. It's somewhat close to a fine dining experience, at chain-restaurant price. One of the reasons I'm seriously considering relocation to Madison now, haha."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot! I've been searching for a good martini bar to replace my favorite one back home. And though The Icon doesn't replace my favorite.. It's a pretty close second. 

I ended up meeting up with my roommates here, and planned on meeting my date here later on in the night. So I ended up ordering a Vodka Cranberry. It was a perfect balance between the both. 

Love the atmosphere here, classic music playing, old movies playing, portraits of Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, Elvis, and a handful of other entertainment icons through out the bar.  Pretty spacious place, and I thought lots of bar room. Friendly staff and bartenders were very attentive.

Can't wait to try this place out again!"}
{"text":"So, some dishes that you absolutely must try...

Patatas Bravas: Potato wedges that have somehow been infused with the pure essence of bacon. Likely fried with bacon fat, which gives it a unique flavor you won't find anywhere else. Served with an incredible tomato-based sauce that would make Mr. Heinz cry himself to sleep with feelings of inferiority.

Baked Goat Cheese: A classic that has been thoroughly Americanized, with great results. You get a big pile of soft, melty goat cheese in the middle of a plate of sweet and simple tomato sauce. Comes with light and fluffy garlic bread for dipping, making the whole thing a kind of \"deconstructed pizza\" with very high-quality ingredients.

Gazpacho/Cream of Tomato: Both are frequently offered as the soup of the day, and both are unbelievably good. As you're probably starting to notice, The Icon is really good with tomatoes. 

Steak/Lamb: The chef is a master at cooking red meat. Every time I order a dish like this, I get a juicy piece of meat that you can cut like butter. When you slice it open you will tear up and swear you have witnessed a new color - that unmistakable red/pink sear of perfection. The steak comes sitting on a bed of potatoes mashed to a consistency where it's almost a puree, but with little lumps of soft, melt-in-your-mouth chunks.

And anything with Manchego Cheese, such as the above mashed potatoes. I can only describe it as butter-flavored cheese. It transcends the boundaries between dairy products and adds this indescribable texture and flavor to everything it touches.


And some dishes to watch out for...

Tres Zetas: This soup is extremely bitter, flavored with nothing but a variety of mushrooms (and that includes the black broth the mushrooms came soaked in). Thus, my Russian girlfriend loved it. But for someone like me, who didn't grow up eating every kind of mushroom in the country, my palette just isn't prepared for it. It's an adventurous choice, and that comes with an inherent risk.

Spanish Tortilla: Tried this a couple times and it's hit-or-miss. It's a bunch of vegetables pressed together in a \"quiche,\" served with flatbread and an aioli that never fail to impress. But the quiche-thing itself seems to take some skill to make right. I got this overcooked once and it tasted like paper."}
{"text":"You will see the face of God if you order the bacon wrapped dates. If you have the tres leches cake, you will reach enlightenment. The cocktails round things out with the sublime knowledge of all knowable things"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and wished it was better. Love the interior and the concept. Fell way short on service and flavor. Everything from being greeted and shown to our table and o actually getting food seemed like an unorganized jumble. And we weren't there at a busy time. The mojito was super sour. Not pleasant. The chicken tortilla soup was 100% flavorless. One of our orders never made it to the table and the server wasn't even aware. We did like the empanadas. Most flavorful item we ordered."}
{"text":"I went to the Icon on several occassions with several different dates. I really enjoyed the clasys but casual atmosphere. The food is really good, but a bit pricey for the small portions. Then again, it is a classy dining place that values on quality. I highly enjoyed the Chicken Skewer, and it was dry along with the Duck Confit they had there. I'm a huge stickler for dried avian dishes, but it was good and still moist.

They also had sangrias there that were pretty good. Overall, I think it's a nice restaurant to take a date when you're in the more serious stage. I would estimate the price of the bill to be $70-$80 for two people. Also, the service was pretty good. They trained their servers to thoroughly describe the dish also to know what exactly is in it."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was perfect and waitstaff cool. Menu delightful but whoever wrote it must have been out of town Sunday night. Nothing matched the description. Worst was the paella which was pretty close to Uncle Bens with some chunks of chicken on top."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the tortilla here, and the wine list is alright too - better than anything you'll find on the campus side of the capitol. But most of the other dishes I've tried, such as the stuffed flatbread, charcuterie plates, and empanadas have been on the mediocre side. This is not to say they aren't tasty, but the idea behind tapas is to savor a few tastes of truly delightful food. The portions here are Americanized, and prepared half-heartedly. The charcuterie wasn't fresh - it seems the meats had been left improperly stored overnight in the refrigerator.

The Icon has potential, but overcompensates in its attempt for Hollywood nostalgia and lands with a result that's more camp than class. I get it - you're trying to harken back to the glamour days of Monroe, Brando, Dietrich, and Grant, while offering tapas to appeal to the sophisticates. Unfortunately pairing cheekily named martinis and cocktails with mid-grade quality food leaves one unsatisfied.

The outdoor seating is lovely in the sumer, but the interior is veering towards gaudy with mostly monochromatic plastic, faux leather, and tile.

I will say I've been kept at the bar distracted by the little TV they have playing old movies and TV shows - it's a cute touch."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I am only giving the Icon four stars due to its location, in Madison.  The food is a nice change from the typical wings, beer, and burger places you find in the area.  Food is pretty good, but I'd agree on some of the other comments regarding portions and cost.  One dish may be enough for four or five people, while another may barely suitable for two.  Just something to consider before coming here.  My wife and I will be coming back."}
{"text":"The Icon started a new special called Tapas Tuesday. The Tuesday special includes $2.95 sangria and $3.95 tapas. I gathered a couple of my girlfriends and convinced them to go with me, and we were not disappointed one bit. I ordered the peach sangria and it was phenomenal. Definitely a sweet sangria, but that's what made it so irresistible (drank three glasses, thank you very much). They also garnished the sangria with fresh fruit, not the typical canned cocktail fruit that you find at other places. It's the small details like that which stand out in my opinion. For tapas, the girls and I ordered the potato croquettes, patatas bravas, watermelon salad, steak skewers, and chicken skewers. Everything was great, but a few tapas did shine brighter than others. The chicken skewers were juicy and well seasoned. The croquettes were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The watermelon salad was refreshing and paired well with the balsamic dressing. My favorite tapas was the patatas bravas. The potatoes are sauteed or fried (not sure) and they are paired with an aioli. Delish! This may be my new Tuesday go-to spot. I am definitely stopping by next Tuesday and I look forward to trying the rest of the menu items. Also, I can't stop craving that delicious peach sangria. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Presentation of food nice. Ambience. Nice. Service. Shit.  We were one of 2 parties in the place when we arrived. A few others were seated after us. I'm ok with other people getting served before me, but when the wait staff don't bother checking in to explain why it's taking so long?  Not good service."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst birthday dinner experiences ever. It was one of my friend's birthdays yesterday and by the end of the meal our group were just trying to get out of this place. 

We had a 7 o'clock reservation, and we sat down at 7:15. Then we were there for two and a half hours, not because we enjoyed staying there, but because our food took that long. 

We started with the sangria, which was decent. 

Then we got Zucchini Frites. All six of us thought they were disgustingly salty and couldn't finish them. We had ordered one serving and the waiter brought out two plates of fries. We thought maybe we were just getting common sense and that he split the dish so that everyone at the table could reach them with ease.¬†We wanted to make sure we weren't being charged for two orders so the second time we saw him we¬†asked him if he had split the order or gave us two orders. He said he gave us two orders and we told him we ordered only one of those and two orders of the Baked Goat Cheese. He hesitantly said he'd take one order of Zucchini Frites off our bill. 

A while later we got one order of Baked Goat Cheese. 
Then a while later we got another one which told us that he had mixed up the orders of one Zucchini Frites and two Baked Goat Cheeses. The baked Goat Cheese was good. 

-Spanish tortilla- a cold quiche which no one really enjoyed
-beef Empanada and¬† chicken Empanada - no one really commented
-stuffed Flatbread - good
-Sea Scallops - okay 
-Braised Short Ribs - friends said it was good

Over the two and¬†a half hours, our waiter never refilled our drinks although our wine and water glasses were all empty. During the last hour, I asked him for water three times whenever I saw him and I still never got water. Even though he only brought out one dish at a time, he never brought water. He also never stopped by in between bringing our food. I finally got up and went to the bar and waited for 10 minutes as I could see the one bartender was busy and then I asked him to give me some water. 

We got the bill and the waiter had added his mistaken order of additional Zucchini Frites. 18% gratuity was also added. Not only was the food subpar, we didn't get any service. A child could have given us our food. It took a very long time between every single dish and the waiter never checked up on us in between. 

The friend who suggested going there for¬†a nice birthday dinner apologized to us for the awful experience and got up to tell a guy at the register that considering the service we received, we¬†didn't think the added gratuity amount was agreeable. He said okay. A few minutes later, our waiter came to our table and asked \"You guys did finish the zucchini fries right?\" We promptly told him that we did not because they were gross. But we didn't understand why he would even ask that. It was his mistake for bringing out two orders and we told him right away that we had not asked for two orders. That was extremely petty of him. 

Mind you, we did leave a more than deserved tip. But we were not going to leave a full 18% for a bill that high considering how much we ordered and the awful service. We also saw a couple other groups around us leaving and new groups being seated. We thought maybe due to added gratuity for a six-person table, our waiter didn't care or they were understaffed. 

Not only does Icon receive broadway audience patrons¬†since it's¬†located¬†next to the Overture, but it was also graduation weekend, so none of us could understand why they were understaffed.¬†I've experienced¬†responsible restaurants¬†turning my party or other customers away because they were under staffed¬†despite empty tables. Now I appreciate them even more¬†since I understand that they were being responsible and¬†just wanted to give us a¬†decent level of service.¬†Icon has to get its priorities straight. It seems to be all frills."}
{"text":"We chose The Icon because of it's close proximity to the Overture center and percentage off your first drink and dinner promotion when you have a ticket to the Overture Center. When you walk in you think you're in for a treat. Up-beat, contemporary, and \"cool\" is what I thought. Very different than your typical DT Madison establishment. We left saying we'd never go back again. The food was sub par and way overpriced for what you get. I mean, $14.95 for 3 bites of, what looked like, pot roast and mashed potatoes? Ridiculous! On top of it all they wouldn't honor our 50% off the first drink, per the website's promotion, because our tickets were printed off of a printer. I get this but come on!! Isn't that how most people do it these days? Don't go here unless you want to leave hungry and broke."}
{"text":"My date and I went in for dinner and drinks on a late Saturday night and we were very impressed with the atmosphere (chic and sexy), service (fast and attentive) and food (delicious). We split the zucchi frites, duck confit flat bread, and calamari- they were all very good and nice size portions for tapas. We also split a bottle because, afterall, it is a wine bar. We'll have to try their cocktails next time. They have 5$ select martinis after 10 pm Fri-Sat, half price bottles Wednesday after 8 and Sunday, and half price sangrias Tues/Thurs all day!"}
{"text":"You would think that a place located across the street from the Overture Center for the Arts would be skilled at getting a pre-show crowd in and out quickly. You'd be wrong. You would also think a place that has at least 4 visible servers in and out behind the bar would be able to give patrons seated at the bar great service. Well, at The Icon, you'd be wrong about that, too. A friend and I went last night before an Overture performance (The Book of Mormon - it was *fantastic*!). We arrived at 6pm and were told that without a reservation there were no tables (ok...but there are like 5 visibly empty tables so...whatever). So we sat at the bar, where we waited and waited for basics like water and menus and to ask questions about the food. My friend ordered 3 tapas plates. We had to a) try to flag down a server just to get drink refills, b) tell a server (not our original server, but she wasn't paying attention to us) that we were going to a show that started at 7:30 so they didn't need to stagger the tapas, we were in a bit of a hurry; and c) at 7:05 ask *again* where the 3rd plate was because we still hadn't received it. When that 3rd plate arrived, my friend had to practically inhale it because it was already 7:15 and we had to hustle. The food was good, and any place that has my favorite Red Breast Irish whiskey on its bar menu gets some props from me, but we certainly won't go back when we're in a hurry."}
{"text":"I went here on a Thursday night, we had reservations but it actually wasn't necessary, which I guess is pretty surprising.

I'll start off with the bad - They charge you $25 per each person who doesn't show up on your reservation...I'm pretty sure that a one person difference wouldn't change your table size, so it seems a little ridiculous.

I like the decor - they have a classy 1950's lounge feel going on, everything is very clean and simple - but I felt like you could be wearing any type of clothing and fit in fine, which is good for a State Street restaurant, because you often go to them on a whim.

Our service was good - but again, this might have been because the restaurant wasn't busy on the night we went, I've heard iffy things about the service and the packed tables when they are busy.

The menu is substantive, there were multiple options for everyone in our party which included both vegetarians and kosher eaters. We ordered three or four dishes at a time, which allowed us to gauge where we were at in our hunger levels.

The best part about going on a Thursday night was that they had 1/2 price sangria pitchers (with tapas purchase). There were about five different flavors of sangria (included were straight red or white sangria), which I had never experienced, so that was fun - I liked the raspberry a lot! 

I enjoyed everything I had on the menu: the crab cakes were great considering they were served in Madison, WI; the Espinaca Artichoke Dip was plentiful, and they were quick to give us additional crostinis when we ran out; the Patatas Bravas were flavorful and addicting - potatoes are a great thing to try new flavor combinations with; I particularly loved the Stuffed Flatbread with spinach, mushroom, monterey jack and goat cheese, served with sherry tomato sauce and finished with garlic parsley oil - that in particular was a very large portion; the Spanish Tortilla  was the most mediocre of the plates we had, but there was really nothing I could complain about.

Even with an automatic 18% gratuity, our party of seven paid less than $20.00 each for our meal and drinks, which we were very impressed by, I had expected paying much more - particularly because our other main tapas restaurant in Madison (Eno Vino) can run you dry."}
{"text":"Great tapas, definitely impressed.  Some favorites: baked goat cheese, patatas bravas and the jam√≥n-wrapped scallops. The sangria was also very good, and while I didn't try the cocktails, those in my group who did were really happy with theirs. The place is quite nice, but small, so I recommend going when it isn't too crowded."}
{"text":"This is my go to for a casual dinner or drinks with friends. There are lots of vegetarian options. The Margarita flatbread, artichoke hearts, and salads are some of my favorites. Excellent wine list and service. They have great specials (1/2 price wine on Wednesdays and a Tapas special on Tuesday)."}
{"text":"I really love this place in Madison. When I moved here from Spokane, Icon left a great impression on me. I had a great time the first time I went there and they were even playing one of my favorite movies (The Thin Man) at the bar. It became a go to celebration place for me and so I am willing to overlook some of Icon's faults. First off, this place is not cheap, especially if you get wine. But they have an excellent wine selection and for those with more pedestrian tastes in alcohol (myself included), they have beer too. Not everything on the menu is of the same caliber. Some menu choices are excellent (ex. braised short ribs) while others may miss their mark. Because this is a tapas bar, take a friend and plan to share multiple dishes. The size of the serving tends to be smaller and so it's better to split three or so dishes with another person. For the first dish, I enjoy one of their flatbread selections. Second course? I almost always default to braised short ribs (those are amazing). For desert, I like the tres leches. This is a nice place for a treat with a good ambiance. Or you could just have a drink at the bar."}
{"text":"Absolutely great little tapas bar was an unexpected delight. We don't have a good Spanish restaurant in the Twin Cities anymore, so when we walked by this place on a quick trip to Madison, we knew we had to try it. The food was great - get the bacon wrapped figs and the meat + cheese tray for sure. They need to do a little better job training the staff on wine service and selection, but that is a very minor complaint. They have half-priced bottles of wine on Sunday and tapas and drink specials on Tuesdays. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Baked goat cheese was great, could have used more bread though.  Also had the chicken skewer and mussels.  The mussels were a unique prep and one of the best I'be ever had!"}
{"text":"The food has always been good but as of late the service is terrible.  The last several times I have been there the the ladies waiting on the tables were friendly but tuned out.  It took about 35 minutes to get our order of drinks and all of the food and drinks were placed on the table at the same time!   It was nearly impossible to get water and the three ladies spent most of their time in the far corner chatting.  There didn't seem to be any manager around.  On a normally busy night (there were two large events at Overture and it was College Graduation night) The Icon was not full at all.   It's too bad because it has good food and it is a good concept.  It desperately needs good management."}
{"text":"I've had a blast both times I've been here. Obviously the point is to share, but as long as you don't go in expecting traditional tapas or to not spend $20-30 per person you'll have plenty to eat and in good variety. The goat cheese....something or other...is a must-get for us. The cheese plate had all of the garnishes I enjoy."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon the Icon after another restaurant was too busy on a Friday night before a show.  What a find!  We had several dishes, all of which were excellent.  Our waiter was AWESOME.  After we left he ran down State St. to return a necklace my wife had dropped on the floor.  This was the cherry on top of the cake.  We will absolutely be back - the food, the ambiance, and the staff were all wonderful and this Madison jewel."}
{"text":"I have noticed other yelpers complaining that this is not a traditional tapas restaurant, but it does not claim to be.  There is nothing traditonal about this place.  There are a few traditional tapas on the menu, but the purpose to have an original dining experience, step back in time, chill with our fave icons and share small portions of somewhat avant garde dishes.  I wanted to rate this restaurant higher because I really enjoyed the experience, but the food is not the greatest.

The restaurant is long and narrow with stylish retro red barstools lining the bar the full length of the restaurant.  Tables are small and fit in well with the decor which inculdes life-sized portraits of icons such as Marilyn Monroe and Clint Eastwood.

My favorite tapa was the fish fry.  The fish was tender and flavorful and served in a unique way.  What a concept...making the Friday fish fry into a fun and tastey tapa.  My least favorite was the flat bread...just a few chopped items.  Some menu items were inspired by our icons, such as the carmelized bananas with peanut ice cream for Elvis.  The chocolate moose was delicious.  

They have a creative drink menu which are themed after the icons with names from films or famous quotes.  I drank a \"Rebel without a Cause\".  This drink was a refreshing blend of citrus vodka muddled with a generous amount of basil and mint.

Prices are reasonable.  I will likely return on one of my visits to Madison.  This is a fun place to go with a group before heading to bars near the capitol."}
{"text":"This is the best wine/tapas bar in Madison ... Everything is really good here, with the exception of their sangria .. I have been to authentic Spanish places with good sangria .. theirs was extremely catered to the masses, think koolaid with alcohol and fruit.. I love their fritata dish, the goat cheese and marinara and I LOVVVVE their desserts, avoid this place when there are shows across the street it gets busy.."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this restaurant 5 stars however I was disappointed that they did not host an Oscars Watching party.  If you pay attention to the decor, you would understand why.  As for the food, the Tapas are excellent.  I recommend the patatas brava and for dessert the Tres Leches cake. Hope I am not shooting myself in the foot as I am a big fan of their desert.  Drink specials are also great!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like trying many dishes instead of one entree.  Cool retro atmosphere.  Space is small on inside, so have to agree with other reviews that conversation can be a little difficult.  There is small outdoor seating area during warmer months that is always fun.  Who doesn't like people watching while eating good food.  The wine selection is good.  If you order sangria, plan on a taxi or public transit, cause volume is more than the average joe should consume.  
The menu is not overwhelming, but i have only sampled the tapas and desserts.  I tend to stick with the hot tapas.  The beef empanada, short ribs and goat cheese are a must.  You have to ask for extra bread with the goat cheese but is an extra cost.

The wait staff is always friendly and are very knowledgeable.  I have been here multiple times, decent place to stop and have a drink also.  The price is a little expensive, but overall a great experience.  If it wasn't located on state st., probably would only be a three star, but location always makes the difference.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"The food was average/good, but too expensive for the portion sizes. I've eaten tapas all over the country, and these were some of the smaller portions I've seen, and prices in line with San Francisco or NYC. The meal was ok, but we couldn't seem to order enough to be satisfied. Also, the service was slow. 

But the real kicker was they charged 50 cents for the stuffed olives in my martini! Overall, too expensive and not enough food to make it worth going back again. 
It was a pretty disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I have gone to Icon many times before and have always enjoyed the food and service.  I am still trying to figure out if what happened last was actually real or just a bad dream.  I walked in with a friend around 7 pm for dinner, without reservations.  After requesting a table for two, the hostess met us with a blank stare and said 'um...'  After what seemed like a painfully long time she reported they were full (which we could see of course).  We suggested she take our name to which she replied 'um...'  Now this is where things turn from disappointing to outrageous.  My friend states we will wait at the bar to which a male server also at the host stand replies, 'there are no seats at the bar, we could put a napkin on the floor for you.'  After outright asking them if they wanted our business, the response was a blank stare.  We had no choice but to leave.  .. And we will never return.  Customer service 101 wouldn't even begin to cover it for these two shameful employees."}
{"text":"Service was slow start but once we were served it was good. Just ordered a few apps - The Goat Cheese App was great! Good Flavor! The Shrimp App - shrimp was small and not much flavor."}
{"text":"Whoever was bartending last Friday at around 10 pm, was just awful. We had 4 people with us and we sat at the bar. It took about 10 minutes to get our drink orders. Two of the ladies we were with had ordered martinis while I had a beer and the 4th just had water. I got my beer before the martinis were made, which is fine but it took an additional 5-10 minutes for a Cosmo and some chocolate martini were delivered. Mind you it wasnt busy whatsoever. There was plenty of seating at the bar. When the ladies took a sip out of the martinis their faces instantly puckered. Apparently they have been their previously and said both martinis have never been like that. When I brought it up with the bartender, he basically said he'd been doing this for 20 years and that they were perfectly fine. I just asked to close my check and we would like to leave. He comped my beer, which the beer was probably the best part of that experience. It would have been one thing if the bartender had just apologized and asked if there's anything he can do, but he was just argumentative and probably drunk to be honest. I was sad because I really wanted to try the food because the menu looks great. Only reason it doesn't get a 1 star, is the food."}
{"text":"We went to The Icon for Tapas Tuesday, where many tapas are $5 or less. We got the empanadas, crab cakes, and baked goat cheese. All three were excellent! We also got the house sangria which was very tasty for only $2.99. A great stop for tapas, but seems to be worth it only on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"I hit this place up before a concert. Perfectly located next to the Orpheum and the parking garage. Blink and you might miss this place. It was Thursday night and they had half price sangria. $10 for a pitcher, definitely a deal.

We ordered 6 tapas for three people. It is easier to list them: 

1. Goat cheese with crostinis. It was ok. The fact that it was not hot ruined it for me.
2. Beef empanada. Delicious, I could have eaten ten of them. Very good sized for sharing.
3. Chicken empanadas, see above.
4. Bacon wrapped chicken. Awful!  Dry, SMALL, and not worth the money.
5. Margherita flatbead. So good and a great addition. It is not a stand out but a great addition and filler to the rest of the food. 
6. Zucchini fries. The flavor was good but the texture threw me off. They are soft and sort of melt when you bite them. They are fried on the outside. So it is hard then liquid. I would not do this again.

We also ordered two desserts. The flan and the chocolate mousse. The flan was good, however its friend the mousse outshined it. The mousse was exquisite and perfect sized for sharing with two people.

Service is great. I would definitely check them out."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my go to places before overture shows- decent food, nearby, albeit a bit slow but that's just the nature of tapas. Recently however we had an experience that ensured I will not be returning. My boyfriend had made a reservation but when we arrived they said they couldn't find it. Fine- they said they could try to squeeze us in in 15 mins so we agreed and went for a walk. When we came back as instructed in 15 mins we stood at the hostess stand for 5+ minutes while everyone ignored us and avoided eye contact. No one had the courtesy to tell us a simple sorry we don't have space. I'm not sure if the mistake was on our side or theirs but either way it should have been handled respectfully and if they had just said sorry we don't know what happened but we don't have your reservation and we are fully booked tonight that would have been infinitely better than being ignored until we finally gave up and left without talking to anyone."}
{"text":"Have the baked Brie! A wonderful wine selection and beautiful atmosphere. Especially love going here in the summer and sitting by the window"}
{"text":"As a student, I highly recommend Wednesday nights--a wide selection of $15 bottles of wine, and all the ones I've tried have been good.  Wednesday is apparently also \"little black dress night,\" with free glasses of wine for women in black dresses, but I think you have to sit at the bar to get the special.

In general the tapas are good; some of them are really entree-sized, like the flatbread pizzas.  I had a zucchini one that was not bad, a little bland, which seems to be an issue with some of their dishes.  I recommend the cheese plate.

The service is generally okay, although I've definitely had some servers who were better than others."}
{"text":"My husband, 2 friends and I dined at The Icon on July 4th. It was not a busy evening in the restaurant so you'd think you'd receive 4 star service...not a chance with Mackenzie, our self-important and pretentious waitress. She actually asked my friend to move his mussel shells from the bowl to a plate and then she would clear his plate. I'm sorry, but I know I don't pay to work during my meal! The food was mediocre at best. I ordered the curry chicken salad and a few other unimpressive selections. The curry chicken salad was swimming in mayo, at least a half cup or more. It was the most disgusting chicken salad I've ever had. I commented to our waitress that the amount of mayo was unbelievable and that I was very disappointed in the dish and she just said \"that's how it's made,\" no offer to take it off the bill or to replace it with a different selection. The sad thing is that the dish was less than $7 and that should've been a no-brainer for them, unless they are that strapped for cash. All in all, I'd take your business to another establishment where the food is better and the servers actually want to kindly assist you."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my coworker to try out. The place was trendy looking, the tapas was pretty good. I wish they had some kind of rice dish or garlic potato salad that I'm use to see in Chicago. since were in Wisconsin. I like braised short rib and stuff flat bread."}
{"text":"I've been to really good Spanish/tapas restaurants in major cities. For Madison, this used to be a restaurant I enjoyed going to with friends. In fact, I spent one of my birthdays here six years ago. I don't know what happened between then and now, but the quality of food has completely deteriorated. 

In short: the food was bland and disgusting. There were no croquetas, which is a classic and basic Spanish tapas. The \"grilled\" calamari tasted like it had been thrown in boiling water and nothing else. The shrimp was overcooked and overpriced--two large shrimp (no garlic olive oil, which, again is the classic gambas al ajillo dish) for $15. Lol.  My friend and I were appalled. To make matters worst, the bartender lacked any couth. 

Needless to say, I will not be returning. To detox the horrible culinary experience from our system, we ended up going a block down the street to Centeno--much better service, ambiance, and quality of food. 

If you've never had tapas, do not deceive yourself into thinking this is anything close."}
{"text":"The food is fussy and over complicated, which wouldn't be so terrible if it was actually good.  But, the food is actually quite average.  What's the point of having 1,000 different ingredients in a super complicated dish and then stacking it in a an intricate presentation when the food tastes like crap?

Service is horrible with rude wait staff.  I had to ask for water 3 times and I was given nasty glances for doing so!  Tables are jammed next to each other, which made for a physically uncomfortable dining experience and also made the place really loud!

JUST DON'T GO!"}
{"text":"Icon is a fine resturant but in the wrong town. I don't think that the location really benefits the fine tapas that they have here. The food I've had here has just been stellar, although be prepared to pay a hefty amount for it. The wait staff has always been extremely friendly and knowledgable in the way that high quality places expect their staff to know every ingredient in their dishes. This is that kind of place. 

All of that said, I've only been on the 15 dollar wine bottle night. Try the maximo, great wine there for the 15 dollar price tag. You should certainly come here and try it, but perhaps have a snack beforehand so you don't bust the bank."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. We had the baked goat cheese (to die for), crab cakes (out of this world), the crispy duck leg (delicious) and the braised octopus (good flavor, but not our thing). Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Another travesty on State Street.  Its far from \"tapas\" and more like overpriced appetizers.  Small portion, expensive bar food.

The space is ok but felt contrived.  Any decent bar knows that keeping wine on the wall in full sunlight is a no no.  

Service was the usual State Street mediocrity but there is worse.  

Obviously Icon stays around because of its proximity to the Overture Center and because real tapas are non-existent in Madison."}
{"text":"I went to The Icon last night with 5 of my girlfriends. We didn't think seating would be a problem since it never looks crowded. However, when we got there it was kind of crowded and they assured us we would be seated in 30-45 minutes. We didn't mind so we had some drinks at the bar. Travis, Jeff and Justin were great. They were very accommodating and friendly. We had a lot of fun at the bar until we started getting hungry. We then realized we had been waiting an hour for a table. While we were STILL waiting, we ordered the cheese plate and two bottles of wine. It was pretty good. 

When we were finally seated, we ordered the mussels, calamari, surf and turf, petite filet, cheese flat bread and the crab cake. They brought over the chicken skewers, too, which was really nice. The mussels were OK. I first tried the one on top which didn't have a lot of sauce which kind of turned me off, but when I did get one with sauce it was decent. The calamari was good and had a nice kick. It was my first time trying crab cake which was delicious. The surf and turf, petit filet and cheese flat bread were pretty good, too.

All in all our experience was good minus the waiting. It was impossible for our table server, Kim, to live up to the standards set by Travis, Justin and Jeff. I wouldn't mind going back and if we didn't have to wait 2 hours for a table I would have given it a 4."}
{"text":"I realize this is a tapas bar, but were some of the dishes at a \"regular portion size\"--I have a feeling this place would be easily one of the most crowded restaurants in town. But it's not, and that's fine--because the more people that are in there, the less of a chance I can come in and get some of the best food I've had in Madison thus far.

The dishes we had the other night include:

Patatas Bravas: as many have mentioned, this is probably one of the best dishes on their menu. Potato wedges that have the taste as one of my cohorts described as \"barbeque Lay's potato chips\" but without the guilty feeling of needing to be eating a potato chip. The aioli that comes with it is superb and I wish I could get it just to have for sandwiches or something else at my own leisure. A little greasy, but that's what makes them SO good.

Grilled Lamb: Potatoes and lamb with a Jack Daniel's glaze that is absolutely to die for? What's not to love about this? The chef really can cook red meat astoundingly well as Yelper S.M. notes. The lamb I got was a little chewy because it was so fatty, but it was also one of the most flavorful lambs I've ever had. At ~$12.95ish, it's a little much for such a small sampling, but if you try it, you'll understand that it's actually incredible and worth it.

Baked Goat Cheese: I love goat cheese and I love being able to dip bread into this wonderful dish with the cheese and marinara sauce-combination. However, a complaint: they only give you 6 slices of bread (it IS a tapas place), so if you get it and share with others, you'll probably need to refill up on bread. Which, our waitress was kind enough to do for us, but not kind enough to tell us we'd be charged for it.

Bay Scallops and Shrimp: My significant other loved this dish, as he's a huge fan of scallops. It's got a really nice sauce with a little kick to it. 

Duck Confit: I have a deep, dirty, and dark confession: I hate duck. It's greasy, it tastes awful compared to other birds, and really--it's hard to do well. I've had it at a lot of places with no success. However, unlike other places in Madison--the chef here doesn't make the duck greasy. Instead, ours was a little dry. But it had figs, so I can forgive. If you use figs in anything, you've automatically won my heart--seeing as I have the spirit of an 80 year old with a love affair with Fig Newtons.

Tres Leches: Oh, Frida's, step down. There is only one Tres Leches in this town worth having and from now on, I will never have reason to visit you. The Icon does a perfect Tres Leches. Perfect. I crave this. I could write a 15 page essay on why this is SO fantastic.

That said, I'd definitely love to come back. However, there are reasons why some might hesitate in coming back/coming here:

- The aforementioned additional fees with restocking bread for goat cheese dish. I'm not knocking that they're charging, but letting us know of the additional fee would have been really nice.

- The place is cramped and crowded as hell, at times. Like, a little claustrophobic. But I never noticed it was too loud and it does feel very comfortable.

- Our service was very slow. Granted, we had to wait 15 minutes for our other half of the party to arrive, but after they got here, it was another 15 minutes before we were even noticed again and approached for dishes. After that, it was about 20 minutes either way. I understand it might have been busy, but there were two groups aside from us there that got their food and left before we had even gotten our second dishes.

- The portion sizes are small. This is a tapas bar, not a full-fledged meal. I don't have a problem with this, personally, but some might and I figure it's worth warning about.

I love this place, kitschy, Hollywood-theme and all and I'd definitely like to come back."}

{"text":"Called and made a reservation for a birthday party, gave them my credit card info to hold the spots, and they called back a few minutes later saying they couldn't accommodate such a large group.  Very unprofessional, and unaware.  My 23 friends and I won't be visiting the restaurant if they can't even figure out reservations."}
{"text":"I understand now why most reviews are 3 stars. It's a perfect place to head to if you are thinking you want to go grab a bite/drink before a show at the Overture Center. Well, that's if you come at the right time. For sure the earlier the better. 

We went about 1.5 hours before our show was set to start and the place was packed. It was a Tuesday. We waited about 5 minutes before getting seated. We were greeted at least twice saying, \"It will be just one minute.\" 5 minutes later --- we get two spots at the bar because there are no open tables.

Then we wait another 10 minutes before we are able to order any drinks or food. Then it's about another 15 minutes before we get our first tapas.  We think that our food was sent to other folks who sat at the bar after us. 

There is not much organization. Anyone who orders from the bar gets their food too early or too late. The food runner kept saying, \"where does this go? the ticket just says bar.\" We knew that we would probably not get all of our food.

We were right. We had to tell our server which foods were ordered were not received yet. It's not anyone's fault except the system they created to send out food is not organized. Plus they need to hire more people. It seems like there were only 3 servers who were also food runners for other people and bartenders all at the same time. Who knows---maybe they were prepping food too. 

The food was okay. It's was not the best, but were were hungry and thirsty. The white sangria (we got a pitcher) was sweet. It was also a great deal. Apparently, Tuesdays have great deals: $4 tapas and deals on their sangria (pitchers). 

We probably won't go back right before a show. I would not mind going back for a drink. 

Good luck. You need a lot of patience to enjoy your experience."}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe. It is on state street so I was a little worried that it would be flooded with undergraduates students since it is the first weekend they are all back. But I think the bar/atmosphere caters towards a more young professional crowd. 

Servers were patient when our party got larger and we ended up needing four tables together. Some drinks were a little slow to come out but they apologized for the wait. 

I had the Duck Tenders which were pretty good and great portion size if you are just looking for a small snack for yourself. I also got 2 $5 Martinis (after 10pm prize),  Marilyn's Cosmo- delicious. The Chocolate- pretty strong but a good dessert cocktail. 

I would not have a full meal here, it is a tapas bar so your bill can start running a little high if you are walking in starving. But if you just want a couple of drinks and a small bite it's the perfect place!"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. Delicious cocktails and lovely food. Our group had some misses (the Tres Zetas soup could have doubled as a salt lick), but everything I had was a home run. 

- the An Affair to Remember martini (chocolate raspberry) - no alcohol tang, but not too sweet
- Gentlemen Prefer Blondes cocktail (strawberry & champagne concoction) - light and perfectly bubbly
- Stuffed Flatbread - perfect crust, layered, complex flavor
- Triple Chocolate Mousse - airy, a nice dark flavor, nicely complemented by fresh fruit

Our server was friendly and attentive, the decor is bold, and the foreign & classic films playing silently usually provide something interesting to look at. Though a bit on the pricey side, it's a great place to hit up on a date or with a group for an evening a little more on the formal side."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner tonight with a friend, and I was quite impressed with this little restaurant! Tucked away between shops on state street, the sign is a little hard to spot as it is overpowered by the Orpheum Theatre signs. I was seated very promptly, given that it was Saturday at 6pm, and the restaurant was very empty. I sat by the windows, which were nicely decorated with fairy lights and thin curtains. Only downside to sitting by the windows is that people walking by the restaurant WILL stop and stare at your food!! 

Menu was expansive and had lots of choices. We narrowed it down to the Seared Duck, Crispy Fried Calamari, Stuffed Flatbread and the Seared Scallops. Calamari was good; a pretty big portion for tapas. The Flatbread was a HUGE portion! There were maybe 8 pieces, definitely enough to feed more than 2 people. The Duck was a little disappointing, because it was not \"seared\" per se; the skin/fatty part was a little chewy. Good flavors though. Scallops came last, and it was on a bed of spinach and caramelized onions, and was very flavorful. 

Nice place to stop at for a date or with a friend; sharing small plates is always fun because you get to try more from their menu :) Good ambience, service was good, and delicious food."}
{"text":"Trennnnndy. But not intimidatingly so. A great location for a first date, or for drinks with a group of people. Drinks are good, martinis are strong. Tapas are on the whole, delicious. Ask the staff for recommendations."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed when we went last week. We sat inside and it took a good 5 mins for a waitress to say hello.  We had a group if 5 and ask what she recommended drink wise.  She said the sangria was good so we got two different kinds to share...she was right! The raspberry and white where both very good!  We ordered a bunch of dishes to share...the prawns came very undercooked and she still charged us for them.  We ordered the baked cheese and never even got it even after reminding her AND it still showed up on our bill.  Everything was very small so do not go in hungry. Unfortunately it wasn't worth the time and money :("}
{"text":"Would give it three and a half stars, but I'll err on the side of caution.

I've been to The Icon twice.  The atmosphere is nice but only as long as you're lucky enough to not have anyone seated next to you-- the tables are ridiculously close together.

Food is hit and miss.  The cold tapas have been better than the hot tapas on the whole.  Definitely avoid the chicken croquettes.  

Service has also been spotty.  Tonight the waitress kept throwing more plates on the table before we had a chance to get even halfway through.  You think she would have taken a clue when I said \"Oh... O'kaaaaaay...\" when she tried to jam a third plate onto our table.  Guess not.

The real problem with this restaurant is value.  It's not that any given menu item is necessarily overpriced, but both times I've been to The Icon I've felt like the overall experience and the check don't quite match up"}
{"text":"Meh. I was thoroughly un-wowed by my experience at The Icon. My friends and I went on a Friday night and were surprised that it wasn't too busy even at 7:30pm. However, it took longer than it should have to be greeted by the waiter. I sometimes think there is a correlation between restaurants being not busy and servers slacking off, and that rang true in this instance. 

The tapas were mostly forgettable, including the cheese plate that our server raved about. The one thing I do remember what the \"stuffed flatbread\" that was basically a steaming log of overly-seasoned garlic bread filled with veggies and plated over marinara. It felt like something you'd get as a side with your Domino's pizza order. 

We ordered wine for the table, and I was glad to see that they had a good selection of affordable bottles. I did not try any cocktails but it seemed there were quite a few offerings as well. 

Unfortunately, there was just nothing about either the ambiance, food or service that would compel me to go back."}
{"text":"Great drinks! Got a Mojito and it was one of the best I've had and is basically the reason I'm writing this review."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place but haven't been very impressed after going multiple times.

The ambiance is awesome. Probably the best part of the restaurant. Dim lighting, a funky wine display and a hip looking bar make it a fun place to go. Feels like you're at a lounge (and apparently they do bottle service which I think would be funny to do someday). 

However, I really just don't love the food. It's overpriced and looks and tastes so average. It almost seems like they're lazy. I did really like the tuna tartare! 

I would go back for half priced bottles of wine on Wednesdays and perhaps try something from their new menu before going to a show at the overture center. However, there are many much better places in the area."}
{"text":"I would prefer that the Icon call itself a restaurant of small plates, because it strays from the traditional Spanish dishes, but besides that, this place was pretty tasty and the portions were good enough to feel satisfied afterwards. The dishes are reasonably priced and the ambiance is, dare I say \"fancy,\" and on a super hot day in Madison, the amazing air-conditioning made me give the Icon it's 4th star."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when it first opened; it had great food, excellent service, and the location and ambiance couldn't be better. Sadly, it has gone downhill. If you are going to (or just coming out of) a show at the Overture across the street: beware!  We were going to an 8:00 pm show and had reservations at 6:00. We didn't receive our food until 7:40! Most of the other customers were also on their way to see the show and none of them had their food, either. We wound up scarfing up what we could and having to leave to rest so we could run across the street and get into our seats before the show started.  Last Saturday, we decided to go AFTER the show. It was 10 p.m. on a nice, warm night. The host immediately told us they \"decided to close the kitchen and not serve their late night menu\". While we were disappointed, we said \"ok\" and asked to sit outside and have cocktails. Then she told us she \"decided she was going to bring in the tables & chairs in 5 minutes\". Soooo....we decided to sit inside. Then she told us she had cut the last server and there was only one bartender, so we would have to order at the bar and take the drinks to our table ourselves. Mind you this is TEN PM ON A SATURDAY NIGHT IN DOWNTOWN MADISON! Ok, again disappointing, but no problem. 15 minutes later, we FINALLY get served--martinis that were only 2/3 full--not how they're usually served at Icon. I privately message the owner via Facebook and also via email, and here it is, two weeks later, and I haven't gotten any acknowledgment, which is why I decided to post a public review. We won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"I didn't quite know what to expect from this place. 
It turned out to be pleasant surprise -the good kind. 
Now I'm thinking, \"this could be my regular girls night out base bar.\"

It's comfortable, and staff are friendly. The service could be a bit slow sometimes, but one can just sip wine or martini and pass the time. According to my bff, Mark makes a superb martini.

Pretty good wine selection. The Oregon Pinot that I had tonight was good (not the best pinot noir ever, but good), I loved the spicy sauce that cane with calamari. Nice job on the desert - I'm looking forward to the new addition to the menu."}
{"text":"We are sangria professionals! OK there's no such thing, but we really like the sangrias here.  Food was excellent as well.  We come up from Chicago for the art fair and this place is on our permanent list."}
{"text":"Tasty tapas food (try the spicy potatoes dish, the goat cheese dish, and the baked shrimp dish -- all good), pleasant outside seating perfect for people watching and a beautiful view of the Capitol, and attentive and really friendly wait staff.  My friend also enjoyed her white wine peach sangria.  Perfect place if you are staying close to the Capitol, are too pooped to walk too far, and want a little somethin' somethin' rather than a massive meal for dinner."}
{"text":"Wish I could post no stars. Actually just left. A group of four of us had some nice tapas and some wine. Spent some decent money...as I was leaving i noticed that the cushion I was sitting on was wet as well as the back of my dress. It was raining and it appears that their ceiling sprung a leak. I notified our waitress and she told us that she would tell her manager. I asked her if they had a blow dryer in the restroom, she said no but Pauls club next door did, which they did not. Interesting enough, Icon didn't even offer to have us back...food was great...cocktails well made...service sub-standard.  Not sure if we will return."}
{"text":"This review is for brunch. They started doing brunch a couple months ago and have not worked out the kinks. They had 2 for 1 mimosas so we tried it.

They do not have coffee. 

The menu was limited but enough to choose from. They had chorizo biscuits and gravy on jalape√±o biscuits. They had sandwiches and dessert on the brunch menu. The bread pudding looked good but was chewy and tasted microwaved.

They did not have soap in the bathroom. When I asked for soap they said someone probably stole it. Gross. Where are the employees washing up?

There is some patio seating. I would not come here."}
{"text":"Excellent! I'm really happy my group decided to stop into this location. The bar tenders were friendly and knowledgeable and took time to make sure we chose the right drink from the menu. We even had the owners greet us and thank us for the business. It didn't seem like they had been open very long, so I encourage others to try this bar. Well worth it. I'll be returning soon."}
{"text":"I've been to Icon a couple of times now and I don't really have anything bad to say.  The service was fabulous, the staff was super knowledgeable, and the food was great.  The baked goat cheese is amazing, and I also love the jamon wrapped shrimp and skirt steak.  I probably had several martinis but kept coming back to the Strangers in the Dark.  So SO good.  It's great to go with a larger group because everyone can order their own tapa but then pass it around the table to share.  At the end, we ordered one of every dessert and didn't regret it for a second.  

The decor and atmosphere is so cool and chic and I love a place with a simple yet elegant theme.  Yeah it's sort of pricey but I would say well worth it.  I can't wait for another reason to go back!"}
{"text":"we weren't expecting much of this place but i was pleasantly surprised.

(i really really don't understand how the decor ties in with tapas. but i realize the name of the restaurant reflects this? in spite of this, the ambiance felt classy and intimate.)

all the tapas we tried (vegetable-only) were tasty and delicious. i definitely recommend the patatas bravas."}
{"text":"Delicious tapas--had the mackarel a la plancha and stuffed mushrooms--wish this place had been here when I was a student.  The interior design was pretty funky too, if you are into that."}
{"text":"I'm partial to tapas places, and though this place is a much more non-traditional \"modern fusion\"-type tapas place, I still really liked it. Tapas bars are typically pricey and the portions are small (the idea is to order a series of small plates), so I think people who complain about the portion sizes and pricing should understand that if you go to any tapas place that is what you should expect.

Came here in August so I don't remember exactly what we ordered. I remember getting the goat cheese and tomato sauce dip as appetizer, stuffed mushrooms, a kabab dish, sangria, and I believe a rack of lamb. The sangria was a little more like juice than I'm used to but it was okay. The food was very good overall and priced like most other tapas places I've been to (pricey but not unreasonable).

The service was good. Our waitress was really nice and we didn't have to wait long for our first plate. After that each plate arrived as we finished the previous, which allowed for a really unique dining experience and the opportunity to appreciate each dish on its own as a mini-course of the meal. 

I recommend this place for the food and the experience. The place has a great ambiance and you can sit at a small secluded table for a more intimate meal or at the bar or a larger table. I would come back here for a fancy dinner out. I know that they do have happy hour specials and nights where they have $5 martinis and half off wine bottles, all of which sound like great deals for such a nice place."}
{"text":"New to Madison, this is one place I kept passing by and wanted to check out. Went on a Friday night around 7:30pm when the wait for a table at other restaurants around the capital was extremely long. There was no wait at The Icon. Is that a good sign, or a bad sign? 

Had some red sangria, which was good but a little on the sweet side for my taste. Ordered the cheese plate, which had a great smoked sheep milk cheese. They had a special flatbread that night with duck confit, which was amazing! Also had the stuffed mushrooms, which we alright but nothing to write home about. 

I'll return to The Icon to try out some other dishes. I heard the papas are good. They also have late night drink specials and they had some tasty-sounding cocktails on the menu!"}
{"text":"Caught dinner here before a show at Overture.  Location is perfect and the place fills up, so if you're  going on a show night I'd recommend a reservation.  The small plates are quite small (about five bite sized pieces per plate).  Our server recommended 3-5 plates for two people, but even after five we were still hungry.  

The bacon wrapped dates were fantastic, but the other dishes did not live up to the standard they set.  Small dishes should have big flavor and these, while good, failed to deliver.  

If you're just looking for drinks, the sangria and cocktails were great."}
{"text":"Was in Madison for a conference and discovered this wonderful restaurant. It was so good my friend and I ate there two nights in a row! Food is delicious and service is terrific! I'm coming back next year for the same conference and look forward to dining here again"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of tapas, and Icon definitely satisfied my craving. My husband and I were in a rush to make it to a concert, so we stopped at Icon and asked if we'd be able to be in & out in about 45 minutes. They said it was totally doable, which was great! We ordered their Thursday evening Sangria special (1/2 off glasses of sangria). We tried two kinds - raspberry & red - and the red definitely was our favorite. We also ordered calamari, spinach & artichoke dip, an empanada, and short ribs.
 
The short ribs were just ok. I've had better in Madison. We were HUGE fans of the spinach & artichoke dip. It came with crispy bread and there was plenty of dip. I hate when you're left with a pile of chips or bread but not enough dip at the end of a dish, so this was amazing! The calamari was fried calamari. We love it, but it didn't blow my mind. And finally, the empanada was great! I don't often order them, so I don't have much to compare it to, but I would certainly get it again.
 
Icon definitely delivered us a delicious meal on a short time frame!  We'll definitely go back when we've got some time to savor our small plates & sangria."}
{"text":"The visit was average for me. We came before a show at the overture because it was a convenient location and they had a tapas special. We didn't know the special was super popular and didn't make a reservation. Luckily there was room for us at the bar for full service of food.
We ordered: 

A pitcher of sangria - pretty good! Not too much to say about it.
Zucchini Frittes - these were super good. The aioli was delicious.
Baked goat cheese - I wasn't expecting it to come out the way it did, but it was super good. If you're a goat cheese person, I recommend it. Plenty of bread to eat with it as well.
The mussels with brandy cream sauce - eh not a fan of this. The sauce was runny and I wasn't impressed.
Fried calamari - this was good but the jalape√±o aoili made the dish. It was so yummy. (okay maybe there's a trend of me liking aioli...) 

As for service, they were really busy so it was pretty slow. Pretty sure the people at the bar near us got one of our orders before us (we got there before them) but the waitress was apologetic about it."}
{"text":"Update: Went to Graze tonight and it has redeemed Restaurant week in Madison for me; also heard Delmonico's was fabulous - seems like Icon was the only one with [huge] problems."}
{"text":"The Icon is a great spot to get a pre-show dinner.  You are offered small plates, flatbreads, and paella which are all great for sharing.  Tuesday is a great night to go because several of the small plate tapas are only 5 dollars.  The sangria is also discounted that night.

I have always found the staff to be helpful and personable.  They can be understaffed so getting a refill or a new fork was slow.  The bar is impressive but I have never ordered anything but the sangria or a glass of wine.

My favorite things to order is the paella, the empanadas, and calamari."}
{"text":"This tiny little place went unnoticed to me for years. I frequented Paul's club next door but I never even saw this place. On Tuesdays and Thursday's they do half off sangria. I think that's 2.50 a glass but the better way to do this is get a pitcher for 10 dollars. YES. I said a pitcher of sangria. 

I have only ever eaten there once and they got a new chef recently so I feel like I am not equipped to brag about their food even though it looks great when it comes out. But the staff are wonderful, friendly and funny. 

It's a classy feel but we show up rowdy on Thursday nights and they still love us so don't worry about dress or anything. So it can be a great place to start your night or to have a fancy drink before or after a show at the overture center across the street. This place def gets an A+ from me."}
{"text":"I want to like Icon.  I've dined here 4-5 times over the years and I keep coming back because I think that it must be improving because it stays open, but I'm now convinced that it exists solely based upon its proximity to the Overture Center.

The food is average.  The service is average at best.  They do have a decent wine selection at a fairly moderate price point.  That may be the high point, along with a decent cocktail menu.

The tapas menu is inventive, but not well-executed.  

Last evening, the patatas bravas were overcooked and the sauce was very uninspired.  

The crab cake was too much breading and not enough crab--and only one crab cake for $12 does not seem like a good value.  

The stuffed piquillo peppers were served too cold, and the cous cous accompanying them was bland and flavorless.  It had clearly been microwaved, too, instead of reheated properly.   

Lastly, the short rib served with manchego mashed potatoes sounded divine, but it was stringy and not a good cut of meat.  The potatoes were fine, but very light on manchego.  The sauce was the highlight, but Icon's kitchen was not very generous with it.  

Two diners left disappointed, not full at all, after four tapas and one drink each for $86.  

Icon:  neither a good meal nor a good deal."}
{"text":"Great Tapas bar. Check out their Paella date nights on Wednesdays to get a free bottle of wine with your drink! Their Paella is made from scratch and is well worth the 25-30 minutes wait that you are forewarned before ordering it. I suggest ordering and trying their different Tapas while waiting for an overall great experience! Their half-off tapa and sangria nights are also great deals! My personal favorites are their Beef Empanadas, Seared Duck Breasts, and Stuffed Peppers."}
{"text":"I walked into The Icon excited to give it a go. I decided to sit at the bar since I was by myself and was eagerly welcomed by a bartender named Vanessa. She greeted me with a polite hello and asked me what I wanted to drink. I was uncertain so she recommended a tasty chocolate espresso martini, I am no angel. It was amazing. It was a Tuesday night and apparently they have specials on a Tuesday, so she immediately brought me a Tapas Tuesday menu. This menu had a variety of food friendly options to accommodate many people and their different needs. I decided upon the bacon and blue cheese potato skins and wow, they were no disappointment.  Next, I enjoyed the grilled steak skewer, not a large portion, but perfectly sized after enjoying the potato skins. Overall, my experience was great. The bartender was accommodating and had great recommendations, the timeliness of the food arriving was perfect, and the ambience set the perfect mood. If I could, I would rate this higher than 5 stars."}
{"text":"The Icon has a cool patio and I like the cuisine they serve, but I've never been wowed by them. I recently went for a Tuesday night special (Spanish beer, sangria, and tapas for discounted prices) and our entire meal including drinks was $30; quite the steal. 

Unfortunately, the food always seems to be lackluster. We got tortilla espanola and it seemed reheated based on the appearance and texture. The sauteed mushrooms were chewy (almost inedible). 

Luckily, the drinks were still good! I might stick to those next time."}
{"text":"Tuesday night Tapas is really small plates for folks who like their fries with a nice beer bong. Fried potato skins are not tapas, nor are fritata wedges with mayo. Because the \"Tuesday Special Tapas\" were so unappealing, we moved to the regular menu. This was an expensive mistake. Canned artichoke hearts with lo-fat raspberry vinaigrette dressing called a \"gastrique\" is not tapas either and NEVER order the ridiculously priced garlic shrimp, which was 5 shrimp with NO GARLIC. As a value added bonus, the special Tuesday price of Sangria listed on placards on every table and all over the bar was an error and the real price was $1 more per glass. After checking with the manager, the higher price stood while no attempt was made to removed the 20 or so placards on EVERY table. Shame on this place for calling itself a tapas restaurant and shame on the management for not taking responsibility for their own sloppiness."}
{"text":"In town for a conference at the Terrace and we saw the Thursday night special on the chalkboard, paella and a bottle of wine. Our group ordered two paellas and a selection of tapas. Everything was outstanding. Service was excellent. Paellas were distinct and well prepared. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Don't stop in if you're in a rush, but rush and tapas aren't supposed to mix. Overall a great experience. Atmosphere was great, server was knowledgeable, drinks were good, food was okay at its worst and great at its best. Stay away from the veg empanadas and the zuchinni frittes. Empanadas were boring and the frittes have a strange consistency to the crust. You should definitely try the white anchovies. That with the draft wheat beer made the whole night worth it. I will be back to either spend a long night trying the rest of the menu or a quick stop at the bar for anchovies.

Disclaimer: this is been sitting as a draft on my yelp account for over a year. Service and/or food quality may have changed greatly."}
{"text":"Our bartender Matt made the night! He was timely, and friendly. The group really enjoyed the atmosphere. And look forward to our return to enjoy the tapas because the drinks were amazing!"}
{"text":"The food here is so rich and delicious, in my opinion.  It is good for a fancy dinner or having some tapas with drinks.  Their appetizers are completely amazing.  It's an expensive place, but again the food is worth it and the drinks are great.  My favorite is the sangria - I would highly recommend it.  I would also recommend the stuffed goat cheese flat bread and the empanadas."}
{"text":"The food and Caipirinhas were excellent.  Service at the bar was very slow but I wasn't in a hurry, so I didn't mind."}
{"text":"My husband is more of a meat and potatoes kind of guy, but I have been wanting to try The Icon for a while, and I finally convinced him to go for tapas.  He was not disappointed. 

We went for dinner around 8:30, and we were seated right away.  They have a large selection of specialty drinks and wine which looked awesome, but they were a bit pricey (most of the specialty drinks were around $10), so we opted for beer.  They have a very limited selection of beer on tap.  

The service was excellent.  Our water glasses were never empty.  The waitress checked on us several times and timed the dishes perfectly.  She brought one dish at a time, and every time we finished a dish, the next one would be coming out.

We tried the special which was duck confit in filo dough.  This is seriously the BEST thing I've ever put in my mouth.  Every bite was like a little piece of heaven.  It was SO full of flavor and the other components in the dish provided a perfect balance of different flavors and textures.

The stuffed mushrooms were also very good."}
{"text":"Awesome cocktails. There are too few good sit-down cocktail places in Madison. This place really fills that niche for me. Food is good too. Definitely not for dinner time - the portions are too small, you will spend a fortune trying to get full. But it is a good accompaniment to drinks. Mussels with chorizo are good (very rich sauce, just fyi). White anchovies are also very good - my favorite."}
{"text":"The Icon is a great new addition to Madison downtown.  It has a unique and classy interior and a sick wine rack.  The tapas are wonderful and delicious--the baked goat cheese is one of my favorites.  It is a great place for dinner or to go for a few drinks to start off the evening.  The service is great and the sangria alone is worth a stop by!"}
{"text":"Meh is right. Food was bland and ridiculously over-priced. The ribs was actually a rib. $15 for a mediocre rib topped with gravy out of a can. Actually, it wasn't gravy out of a can. Gravy out of a can has more flavor. The scallops were pretty good but two for $15 is nuts. Seriously? Two? Way out of line. The goat cheese and pesto stuffed flatbread had way too much goat cheese. I know that sounds crazy but it's true. I love cheese. I could live on cheese. This had too much. And, I'm pretty sure the marinara they put on the flatbread was Ragu or Prego. Pathetic. They almost scored gold with the anchovies but they ruined the dish with a whopping gob of gross mayo. The service was great. We sat at the bar and ate. Bartenders were friendly and kept the wine and food coming. Wine selection was great, too. Unfortunately, neither the service or wine could make up for the terrible food. This place is living on location alone."}
