{"text":"Fantastic. Can't say enough about this restaurant. Every dish had a unique take and all is delicious. Staff is lovely and the (new) chef is so engaged and interested in talking with diners. Great beer and wine selection. Do NOT pass this place thinking it's a touristy Old Montreal. It's great casual, Canadian bistro food. Oh, and my teens loved it."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this new, vibrant restaurant that Old Montreal has added to its rich repertoire, but...  Both my \"little plate\" and main course arrived to my table in the wrong serving temperature.   *My plate of seared New Brunswick scallops with the lime dressing was well executed and very tasty, but lost its warmth by the time I received it. Did it wait around too long while the chef(s) was (were) preparing the other orders for my 3 guests? If so, why wasn't it made last as the other orders were mostly cold salads or at least kept warm?  *My \"brown-butter lobster rolls\" (rather one long roll) consisted of a cold bun that suspiciously seemed pre-refrigerated. The lobster inside was perfect, but also cold. When our waiter was asked about this, he said one side of the bun is meant to be cold and the other side, warm (it was all cold though).   Positive notes: lovely setting, nice ambience and music, good service overall, excellent location.   Would I go back? I'd probably give this restaurant more time to settle in before giving it another shot. After all, they opened up this past July."}
{"text":"Rockwood food was amazing.  The size of the plates is perfect for sharing. We had the cauliflower, the salmon, the walleye, the chicken parmesan and everything was delicious and well executed. We will definitely go back. I also heard they will open for brunch soon. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My first bad review on Yelp.  Rockwood staff may have had one bad night, but it's always bad business to let one, obnoxious party overpower your entire restaurant.  Half their seating is a continuous bench, which rocked like a roller coaster while trying to finish my meal. They warn that 'Quebec requires that meat must be served well done', but not done to the texture of shoe leather.  You'd think with multiple local choices around this area that they would strive to get loyal return customers. Enjoy a better meal & experience ANYwhere but here."}
{"text":"From the creators of Santos and Tommy Café- comes a canadian Brasserie -Rockwood. I would call it a surf and turf kinda place. You can get seafood and meat under the same roof! Reservations were easy to get via their website and bookenda.   I got there around 8:30 pm, decor is more contemporary - I like the 2$ bill framed in the back- very original. For starters I ordered (rating on 5*): Cheese platter ***( 3 kinds of cheese solid selection but I would've appreciated a greater variety- goat, blue and a Swiss, with a blueberry puré and a side of fresh buttered bread)- we had a fruit fly on the cheese- when informing the waitress she goes \" it's from the outside - flick it off\" and gave us a napkin-quality of service speaks for itself. Although the hostess was very attentive and ensured to bring us our condiments when our waitress was taking too long.   For the main course I had the lobster roll and fries for 18$ *** (generous amount of food for the price - I thought it was great - not to creamy and fresh- good to share between 2); mushroom and Parmesan taglieatelle **** (absolutely divine - great portion and variety of wild mushrooms with freshly sliced Parmesan).  For drinks- I had a traditional bloody Caesar***- watered down but good level of spice.   I feel the calibre of Rockwood is similar to Santos - entitled old Montreal dining if you're hungry but not strong enough to be placed in the Mtl food map."}
{"text":"Un restaurant alléchant......de par sa carte et son ambiance! Les salles sont belles et classes et le personnel plutôt agréable!  Cependant, cela devient très désagréable quand il faut demander plusieurs fois à avoir du pain, de l'eau.... La situation se complique encore plus lorsque les plats arrivent et que la déception se lit sur l'ensemble des visages autour de la table...c'est bon mais vraiment sans plus!  Et le comble arrive avec nos factures....trop dispendieuse pour ce que nous avons mange...et le plateau charcuterie/fromages prévu pour 6 et qui arrive avec 4 morceaux de pain et pour lequel nous avons demandé 2 morceaux de pain complémentaire....ceux-ci nous ont été facturés..... C'est trop....mais je souligne quand même que la serveuse ayant recueilli mon mécontentement a finalement décidé de nous retirer ce supplément! Je ne pense pas que je renouvellerai l'expérience!"}
{"text":"Food was good as was service (we had full meals).  Be forewarned a fountain pop is $5.00.  We had 3 pops with refills....thus $30......that's 15 - 2L bottles from the grocery store.  Drink water.  Our waiter pre-selected his 15% tip when paying, DID NOT APPRECIATE THAT AT ALL.  Wait staff should inform patrons if refills are NOT free."}
{"text":"Awesome meal -- fresh and delicious ingredients. The walleye was incredible and the fried polenta was fantastic.   For vegetarians, the tourtiere is excellent. Chic and stylish decor.  Service was very attentive and knowledgeable. I'll definitely return next time I'm in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"My family and I wandered into this gem. The wait staff was charming, attentive and eager to please. The meal was one of our favorites during our stay in Montreal. The braised pork shoulder and mushroom risotto were both out of this world! Loved the ambience and feel of the place."}
{"text":"Entramos por casualidad, y no pudimos salir mas contentos. La comida deliciosa, y el servicio encantador. Un lugar perfecto para probar la comida típica de Quebec"}
{"text":"À testé le nouveau menu. Mieux que le précédent. Avec un petit verre de vin adapté à ce que vous commandez, c'est très bien. Tres bon service!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends to celebrate an engagement.  When the reservation was made, it was clearly stated that it would be a group of 14.  They assured us the kitchen and staff could accommodate.  They couldn't.  We were first seated at an awkward configuration of high top tables with stools, where many of us had our backs to each other. We were the only group in the downstairs dining room and asked to be moved.  The second table was a better layout but was uncomfortable due to the lack of leg room.  Despite multiple servers, it took 30 minutes before taking a drink order, we ordered 4 bottles of wine.  Then the unopened wine sat on the table for an additional 10 minutes.  After an hour our order was taken.  I asked for the salmon to be served without the lentils on the plate, I was told no.  The poutine was terrible, too much gravy and cold curds.  Our plates were cleared and we waited another 30 minutes for our mains.  There were clearly some issues with the expediting. A few of the group got up to use the rest room and stretch, so the kitchen decided to use heat lamps to keep the rest of the food warm, others in our group asked for the food to be served immediately.  I ordered the mushroom ragout which was flavorless but the mushrooms had a nice texture.  The desserts were the best part of the meal, but nothing to write home about.  In summary, the service and food was terrible and the bill was way overpriced."}
{"text":"Stopped in and chose from the 3 course MTL a TABLE menu  - Squash soup, Poutine with smoked meat and apple crumble. Large portions, very good food. Enjoyed it immensely. $21. What a deal!"}
{"text":"Was a beautiful place great ambiance but drink and food took to long like 45 min long"}
{"text":"The menu looked really appealing so we decided to give it a try!   Lunch menu is an appetizer plus main for $20.    On a Wednesday at 12:45pm, it was pretty empty so no rezos needed. Everything is Canadian themed from the menu to the decor on the wall. I loved the giant picture of the old Canadian $2 bill.  Young Millennials will have no idea what I'm taking about lol. The ceiling has this really neat geometric pattern on it.   We took the lunch menu: shrimp salad plus salmon tartar and their home made donut.  Also ordered the salad of the day: grilled baby corn, asparagus, lettuce on a bed of quinoa.   The shrimp salad had thin slices of fennel, finely chopped chives and a very light dressing on the plate. Flavor is ok and tasted mostly of shrimp.    I enjoyed chasing the salmon roe beads and trying to chomp them between my teeth but other than that, it was a touch salty and would've done well with a squirt of lime instead of just lime pickles to bring up the flavor.   The beigne was alright.  Chewy, deep fried dough.  The strawberry coulis tasted a little artificial but if you take the lunch special, it's only $5, for what it's worth I think I'd only be ok paying $5.  Overall, a decent place but nothing to email home about :)"}
{"text":"Worst ambiance for tasting your food, the music was blasting we asked for them to lower it but it would come back with stong base minutes later ...We where ther. from 6-8 we ordered got our drinks and then it got worst because of a Facebook event at the downstairs bar we got our first course an hour later and then the rest 45 minutes later But by then the music was even louder so I could not concentrate on the food and it was not great from what I could tell...My dad had a the fish and he said it was so salty he could not taste it...bottom line I will never go back ... Sad because I live in the naberhood To top it off it was not cheap and they did not offer us the drinks for our troubles..."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Very bad service. Waiters do not communicate. They ran out of beer, ran out of other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Such a great place!  We came in on a Friday evening with our baby in a stroller and the staff were amazing accommodating us.  Not only were they super friendly, they offered to help, they put the stroller where we could see our baby sleeping, and they kept checking on us to make sure things were going well.  Furthermore, the burgers we had (Rockwood burger) were so delicious!  The staff here are very friendly and kind, and I do not hesitate to give this restaurant with a fantastic atmosphere a top rating.  If we ever return to Montreal, this will be on our list of places to come!"}
{"text":"Très cher pour ce qu'il y a dans l'assiette -menu tres décevant  et le service un peu expéditif"}
{"text":"Great experience in Rockwood. I found the ambiance to be very charming for a date night. Impeccable service. Beautiful restaurant. Solid wine list. The food was savory, tasty and succulent. It was a good demonstration of new Canadian cuisine. I almost forgot that their moelleux au chocolat is to die for. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Rockwood on my birthday because the restaurant he reserved next door was closing early and at 10:30 pm on a Monday night there wasn't much open. The bar part of the restaurant was pretty busy considering it was a Monday night.   The Bloody Caesar I ordered was good and spicy. I got the lobster roll with fries. They put a lot of lobster. The filling was overflowing the bun in a good way. The more filling the better. The fries were good too. Crunchy and salty.   The highlight of the night was the tagliatelle my boyfriend ordered. It had mushrooms and Parmesan. It was so tasty and rich in flavour! If I was up for eating more carbs I would have wanted to eat the whole plate!  I would come back and try the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Started off with pretty slow. Service,  Service got better. We enjoyed the restaurant week special menu. Great deal. Nice setting and reasonably priced. Better feel upstairs than down."}
