{"text":"My wife and I have experienced numerous other restaurants in Streetsville and decided to drop in on Giorgio's.  Found it to be a very nice casual neighbourhood restaurant to add to our list.  Both of us had specials.  Chicken and veal with spinach/mushroom cream sauce served with veggies and potatoes.  Must say the sauce was excellent.  Thoroughly enjoyed our meal and will be back.  Excellent service and nice to see that some restaurants still use real nampkins!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary in October (sorry late review!) - the food was delicious and the service was excellent.  We loved everything that we ordered and they could customize as well (if you wanted your pasta sauce made spicy etc).  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I am not sure what the previous reviewer is talking about - I suspect it is a competing restaurant trying to post a bad review. (Giorgios should try to have that review removed). 
We have been going to Giorgios for years, and it is always a wonderful experience. Everything is fresh, the service is great, and it is a GREAT place for a date. You don't feel squished in on top of each other like in the larger restaurants, if you are looking for a romantic place to bring someone special, this is it! Owners are very warm and professional. Food excellent."}
{"text":"The staff really do not know how to handle a large group. I was here on a Friday night with a group of 15 people. The service was AWFUL. Worst service I have ever experienced. Service was slow and our server was forgetful. When we ordered a second bottle of the same wine we just had, it took 20 min. When we followed up, she said it was on it's way and it arrived shortly after. The restaurant is small and there were only 3 other groups besides ours. Once we ordered our food, it took about 1 hour before we got our appetizers. Then another hour before our entrees arrived. We were starving. My end of the table alone finished 7 or 8 bread baskets because we needed something to sustain us through all the waiting. Our server was polite. But even when we were paying our bills, it was very messy/unorganized. 

This place is getting 2 stars because of the terrible service. I really can't complain about the food. I tried the bruschetta, calamari fritti, and linguini di mare. All dishes were incredible. I would like to say that I will return but the service has really left a bad taste in my mouth. That's too bad because I really like to support local restaurants."}
{"text":"Delicious food, wonderful chef and waitress. We ordered a seafood linguini, margarita pizza, escargot and bruschetta - all were amazing. The only criticism is that restaurant decor is very dated."}
{"text":"Excellent reception, and personal touch.  Food was even better than expected.  We enjoyed the pasta and look forward to trying other stuff next time.  Place was clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"Was here again on April 8, 2017 and again the food was awesome. Tonight I ordered the Calamari Fritti  (a must for an appetizer) and the seafood special ... with shrimp and scallops. For dessert  ... the lemon cheesecake was great. Always a pleasure to come here."}
{"text":"Service was great and friendly, food was fantastic. Giorgio is the chef and cares about every dish that goes out of his kitchen and it shows! My husband and I had a lovely time and will certainly be back the next time we are in town."}
