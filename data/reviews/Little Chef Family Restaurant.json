Have you accidentally wandered into a retirement home? No, you've just set foot inside The Little Chef.

Located inside a strip mall, The Little Chef personifies what a neighborhood family restaurant should be.

Plenty of seating of both the table and booth variety. The space is open and airy, you'll never feel crammed in beside the folks next to you.

In terms of food, The Little Chef is a comfort food lover's dream. Soups, sandwiches, meat pies (eat in or take home frozen) multiple types of burgers, pastas and even the odd more adventurous item like a Thai stir fry or lamb.

This isn't to say any of the food is bland. Far from it.

The day we stopped by for lunch I had the \"threesome\", a spinach salad, tuna melt and tart of the day while the lady had a large soup of the day (potato leek) and a fish burger with salad.

The soup arrived in a large bowl and we both enjoyed the chunks of vegetables floating in the hearty broth.

Our mains arrived and the tuna melt was served on an english muffin with sharp cheddar melted over the tuna/scallion/celery filling. So far as tuna melts go, this was in my top 5. The spinach salad had fresh spinach, hard boiled eggs and a zippy vinaigrette. 

The fish burger was a halibut patty which was crisp and lightly breaded. Some home made tartar sauce on the side was a nice touch.

The tart of the day was banana cream and it was creamy and rich. But not cloyingly super-sweet, which is too often the downfall of desserts like this. 

I've never seen an empty room at The Little Chef regardless of time of day. There's always a table with young children, families of multiple generations or seniors who have been married longer than I've been alive out for a nice meal.

This is definitely one of the \"safer\" choices you could pick for dining in Calgary. However, if you're faced with a group of differing ages and pallets, The Little Chef will provide something for everyone."}
