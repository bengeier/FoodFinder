{"text":"Sign says open till 11pm.  Turned us away at 10:48pm claiming they were closed.  I might expect this from a mom 'n pop place, not a national chain.  Not cool.  Went to The Works down the street instead, which also closed at 11pm but gladly accommodated us.  They will be getting our business from now on."}
{"text":"I tried this ever so popular burger joint just because my friends have been raving about it, and it didn't live up to my expectation.  What to expect -Is a simple burger joint where you order at the front, get your burger and sit down to eat. Very much like any fast food restaurant.  -Cheap prices and REALLY friendly staff. Especially the manager who ensured we had a good experience there and asked us if we enjoyed our meals.  -They serve beef that is hormone and antibiotic free, grass fed and free range.  -LOTS OF CONDIMENTS! AWESOME.   What to eat -Their 4 oz. hero burger was juicy and a healthy portion, although I wish it tasted more like how grilled food tastes like.  -Fries are absolutely delicious, nothing like the frozen McDonald's fries that are all oil. These are real potatoes with SKIN! It tastes better with skin.  The burgers are not the best I've had, not the worst either and it's good knowing the cows grew up well, but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"So unsatisfying.   The burger is rubbery and doesn't even remotely taste like ground beef.  The fries, while they do *look* good, are bland an were cold (despite them being the reason I waited soooooo long for my order... they should have been piping hot!?).  Won't be returning!"}
{"text":"Would not ever return to this location. I clearly received old French fries that had been refried. The burger was bland and does not reflect the price you pay.  Add to that the careless attitude of the staff and will DEFINATELY not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Visited this location several months back. Had no intention of trying a Hero's chain restaurants but dined in on the request of a friend. Dragged against my will- well maybe not entirely true but had low expectations going in.  Upon entering, the room was filled with a thick fog of greasy air. The selling point for me was the fact that the beef burgers are hormone and antibiotic free/grass fed.  The condiments were good but nothing amazing as others claim. The service was slow even though there was no one in line.   The burger itself was bad and lacked flavour. The patty tasted like a bad store bought burger. The fries were ok- slightly overcooked and brown.  For a $12- $14 meal I expect a lot more."}
{"text":"So at this particular location, the manager has TAPED UP the water tan on the soda fountain. She says \"there's a rusted pipe and there's no water.\" First of all, if they're really is a rusted pipe, doesn't that mean it'd affect the rest of the kitchen and any food they put out?  Secondly, how can there be soda in the fountain, but no water? The way the soda fountain works is it adds the soda or tea flavor syrup to the water. This means that if there's soda, there's water, and if the water is \"rusty\" then the soda would be too. However, she has no objection to selling soda.  Either this is a petty trick so she doesn't have to hand out cups for free water for customers buying food, or there's an actual rusted pipe and the business is still operating despite the contaminated water, both scenarios are pretty bad."}
{"text":"This place just openness and the owners have just gotten an amazing break with Wendy's shutting down next door.   I have been to other Hero Burger locations and my experience has been tied entirely to execution.  This is my first visit, the service was very friendly and fairly prompt.  I ordered the Italian Chicken Deluxe and it was perfect. The chicken was cooked perfectly and served juicy and tender and the ciabatta bun was fresh.  I hope they keep it up.  They also have salads, but barely note it on their board."}
{"text":"This is a new Hero Burger location at Front/Jarvis. Pretty much the same quality as the other locations provide.  I find their burger ok.  Nutrition: Their standard burger is one of the healthier burger compared to most other burger places when you pick the 4oz. version. All ingredients taste really fresh. The fries are too dark for my taste.  I have posted the picture of my meal.  OPEN: Sun - Thurs 11am - 11pm  Fri - Sat 11am - 3am"}
{"text":"Regular burger, nothing out of the ordinary. We came here at closing time, so they were already cleaning up the place while we were eating. I've had much better, but I guess this will do when you are hungry."}
{"text":"IT should be a zero. The store was closed at 10:30 PM on a Wednesday night. Both Yelp and their own website state open until 11 PM."}
{"text":"Needed a quick affordable place to eat after a long day of site seeing & Hero's was decent. Tasty burgers, hot fries, & food that could be traced back to the source. Pretty good for a family of 4 on a budget."}
{"text":"I'm not intimately familiar with the chain but this location is convenient to my house.  The place is pretty quiet (tucked away between a number of larger restaurants and small stores.  I generally find the menu at Hero Burger to be pretty confusing. Perhaps we are spoiled by the big-boy chains where they have combos clearly laid out and such. I found that I am scanning left-right-left-right quite a number of times before I understand all the parameters to my order.   The condiments and sauces menu in particular drive me nuts. In my opinion - there are too many options and the menu isn't set up to easily decide what you want.  They usually have one person at the cashier and one in the kitchen. I appreciate how they burgers are prepared right when you order, but it does require quite a wait time for your meal subsequently.   The place seats a good number of tables - but is generally quiet with a few TVs with CP24 showing."}
{"text":"If you're gluten free stick to the burger only. I had the fries and there was onion rings mixed in."}
{"text":"The fries are disgusting. This is two times in a row. They were saturated in oil.  Average size fry was about a pinky nail in length. Gross. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"I was in the midst of the dreaded task of moving last week when a wave of dizziness reminded me that in all the commotion I had neglected to eat anything! By this point, the fridge was as bare as my belly - I would have to seek nourishment from an outside source.   Upon the realization that I required something substantially meaty to satiate my hunger, I made haste to the nearby Hero burger.  I staggered into the restaurant and made a beeline for the counter. It was at that point that it became remarkably evident that I was in worse shape than I thought - I could barely read the menu! I tried to get it together, as I was acutely aware of the man behind the counter's concerned look.  I formed my order in my mind, I wanted a Turkey Burger with cheddar cheese and portobello mushrooms. However, what I said was, \"Can I have a Turkey Burgey?\" The man suppressed a giggle and I stubbornly tried again, \"Sorry, a Turkey Burge..a Turkey Burgah...o dear god, you know what I'm trying to say!  I'M VERY HUNGRY!\" Let's just say it wasn't my finest moment. However, he could see that I was in dire need of food and quickly placed my order with the kitchen.  That turkey burgey was absolutely delicious (and necessary)! I usually tend to prefer a toasted bun for my burgers, but this bun was so soft and eggy that I seriously am considering amending my burger preference.  I enjoy the design of the wrapper, as it is engineered in a way to create a constant barrier and prevent wasteful topping spillage (this is the technical term).   The turkey was cooked perfectly - still very moist, but definitely not about to give me salmonella poisoning (much appreciated!).  My ONLY complaint, is that they advertise that the mushrooms are portobello, and the mushrooms that landed on my burger were just plain ol' button. Still pretty darn tasty, but just a wee bit of false advertising going on there.   I'm convinced that Hero Burger saved my life that day! I'm relatively certain that you'll still enjoy it even if you don't happen to be at deaths door though."}
{"text":"O.k. Today I had a craving for poutine. Now usually when I have this craving I go places like Poutini's or Smokes. Nevertheless I gave this place a chance after seeing their outdoor sign board advertising 4 types of poutine .  Ironically I wanted the 'Caesar  Poutine' and of course it was not available. So I settled for the next available choice the 'Beef Poutine'. I visited their Front Street location just after the main lunch hour rush (so you would think service levels would be faster? Wrong!) The location itself was about 75% empty but several people were waiting for their orders. The people that work in the back had zero chemistry with the person working the front counter and this in term slowed down service levels. I ended up waiting 20 minutes for an order of poutine.  O.K now that I was able to discuss the poor service levels and long wait times lets talk about the poutine. What I received was basically an order of over cooked fries topped with what appeared to be some chopped up burnt hamburgers along with a couple of beef slices. It was disgusting, and sorry Hero Burgers should not be selling this stuff as poutine, more like fries and gravy topped with a bit of cheese and chopped up over grilled beef chunks (some may say 'burnt' hamburgers).  Have never been a fan of Hero Burgers and of the 3 locations I have visited, this place was the WORST in terms of service levels and food quality.  If you are craving poutine, avoid this place. I will never come back to this location again."}
