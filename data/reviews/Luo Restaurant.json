{"text":"Love it! The taste is amazing. Because of this place, I've recently become obsessed with Vietnamese  food. Everything is good, and I eat there at least twice a week. Try it, you won't regret."}
{"text":"For is always fresh, veggies crispy, dishes are nicely balanced, service is very good, love this place!"}
{"text":"Good pho as a fast food restaurant, the best part is we don't feel thirsty after we had the soup  as we had at other pho restaurant in Chinatown or downtown, will be back for sure"}
{"text":"First time here in May this year, was recommended by one of the nice server that their curry chicken on rice as I asked  for rice dish back then. It was amazing and the best curry dish I've ever had in a fast food place. The pho soups are good too, and I couldn't finish a large size pho, so I would say take a small size if you're a girl like me. Try this place, you will not be disappointed if you're looking for pho soup without MSG and also try the homemade curry chicken!"}
{"text":"I very much love Vietnamese food, but I would not recommend eating at Luo's. The simple dishes could have been a staple due to the convenience. However, I have had terrible encounters with staff at the counter here!

Once, the cashier was so rude that I was almost in tears. I tried to come back later. Next time, the cashier was visibly sick with what looked like the flu!

Luo's, please rethink your front staff if you want to retain customers. :("}
{"text":"Quite convenient! The pho soup is great with proper amount of seasoning. Don't have to wait for a long time"}
{"text":"I love love the Guilin soup here! It has very special flavor to it! You have to try the no. 41(my go to soup) , ask them to put more spicy sauce into your soup, they always seem happy when I ask them to make my soup spicier ! Lol"}
{"text":"Le repas complet était mauvais... J'ai commandé la soupe au boeuf, les rouleaux et les boulettes de poisson au cari. 
Les boulettes étaient caoutchouteuses, les rouleaux étaient mous. Le bouillon de la soupe était bon bien que très salé. Il n'y avait pas de basilic thai ni de sauces et les nouilles étaient trop épaisses..."}
{"text":"had the rare beef pho, good price, great broth, nice lady!! not alot of seating"}
{"text":"Ordered on LetsEat delivery to a hotel. Took about 50 mins, mostly everything was Luke warm.... worst part.... the didn't include cutlery?!?! We are in a hotel..... so that really was bad. 
Noodles were super overcooked.
Im certain there is better in Montreal."}
{"text":"The soup at Luo's is nothing close to real vietnamese pho and the sizes are small for the price you pay. Its way too salty (i think they used a beef stock) and the noodles aren't vermicelli. You're better off going to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Located conveniently downstairs of the McGill rez, Luo's is a classic go-to when it comes to comfort soup and noodles. The guilin noodles are chewy and flavourful, with my favourite being #54. There is a wide range of phos, rice plates and noodles to choose from, so there's something for everybody. The service is quick and friendly, and part of the reason we keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"I love the rice noodle here. It's named after Guilin which is a province of China. I have to say the best dish is this Guilin style noodle, number 41, with minced pork. I find nowhere offer this in Montreal, and it is genuine Chinese noodle. 
Sometimes I also have grill three meats and rice. The pho is not the best choice. 
I also recommend the egg waffle and curry fish ball. They are kind of appetizers sold by the street back in China. They bring back my memory of southern China."}
{"text":"Vietnamese food is one of my favourite types of cuisine, but this place was a disappointment. 

the food itself is pretty good, I ordered the beef rice dish and the beef and rice was well seasoned and flavoured. however, 60% of the dish was salad (iceberg lettuce and a few cucumbers, no dressing) and raw bean sprouts.... I paid 11$ for what was maybe a half bowl of rice and beef. 

the spring rolls were decent 

overall (on 10) 
food: 6.5 (the beef and rice was an 8, the \"salad\" brought it down)
portions: 4
price: 5 (expensive for portions of actual food)"}
{"text":"On n'y va certainement pas pour le pho. Salé à outrance, je soupçonne l'ajout de concentré de bouillon de boeuf. Les plats de grillades variés sont corrects. Le service est poli. Mais  la soupe, plat vedette de ce resto,  est très décevante."}
{"text":"Get the shrimp pho--the soup is amazing and the portions are huge. Honestly, my favorite!"}
{"text":"Not sure if I'm supposed to treat this as a Pho shop or a food-court restaurant. 

Anyhow, I was not impressed by what I got: the #13, which consists of a platter with vermicelli, grilled chicken, grilled beef, salad, and 2 egg rolls.

The egg rolls were crispy and tasty. 
The salad (lettuce, pickled carrots, bean sprouts) was fresh but very watery (no flavour at all). Although the #13 doesn't officially come with a drink, I'd like to think that I drank 'fresh salad juice'.

The vermicelli was of the thin type which tangled up into a single roll. I used my fork to pull it apart. No seasoning but ok.

The grilled chicken was the best part of the meal. It was tender and well seasoned (ginger, garlic), it's not seared but it doesn't need to be.

The grilled beef...had a very strong beef smell and taste (almost no other flavour), and it was dry. I spammed the dipping fish sauce in an attempt to make the beef edible.

It all came down to 12$ (without tip), but the portions were average sized. Not as good as 'Spicy noodles' next door."}
{"text":"My friend takes me there to try this Guilin soup(????), as a northern Chinese, I love it so much oddly since it's a very southern Chinese food and I have not taste it in China. Try the pork and chicken , chicken is so tender which is my favorite there, my friend also likes the motcha milktea????, because it's so close to my uni,I will return for sure. 5stars no doubt ."}
