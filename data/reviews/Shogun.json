{"text":"We have been coming here for years for sushi. Andy is a sushi master and we love him! Sit at the sushi bar and he will make you something custom based on what you like or dislike. He is incredible!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Shogun for over 10 years and I'm a huge fan. The service is always very friendly and the food does not disappoint. Get the godzilla tails or chicken over udon noodles.  Best time to go: HAPPY HOUR. You can get godzilla tails for 5$ also the sushi is half off. The beer and sake are next to nothing. GO!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  Great sushi, and nice presentation.  The patio outback is nice and romantic too."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly gratifying. When I  first encountered this place, I was skeptical. Came here on a Saturday and the place was jam packed. It took them a while to sit our group of 16 (they want to make sure everyone is there before you can sit in your room, so you must wait in the lobby). Once we were seated like sardines around the table,  the 'show' began. Because essentially that's what it is, a show. Our cook was HILARIOUS. He is the reason I gave this review 4 stars and not 3. Now, some found him funny,  others found him despicable. All that to say that the cook you'll have in front of you will either make or break your evening.   The food was ok. I took the combination menu which basically consists of a soup, a salad, 2 choices of meats, rice,  veggies and I think a dessert (we left before). All that for about $27. Most people around me couldn't finish their plates because too full.  Will I come back on my own free will? Not likely.  Did we enjoy ourselves, eat well and had a good time? Absolutely !"}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  The atmosphere is a little cold, but the staff makes you feel welcome.  The food is not the greatest (sometimes the goza (sp?) is cold) but it's consistent and flavorful.  Rob behind the bar may seem very busy but he makes time to leave the nicest notes on your receipts - \"It was great to see you.  Have a wonderful evening.\" etc...  They have a great happy hour too - it allows you to try a variety of sushi at 1/2 price.  Def try the Godzilla tails.  Too much fun!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My husband is fan of the sushi, always happy with all he chooses. He averages 90$ at dinner himself. I am a huge fan of the Giant Turkey salad that they have been famous for many many years. I also love the Shogun chicken - sauteed chicken breast with Udon noodles, not oily at all. This place is like home for us. My kids consider it their favorite stop.The tempura is crisp and flavorful- no worry of dirty over used fryer oil. I don't need to be seen at trendy places- I just want consistent meals that I have grown to love. It is perfect for girls lunch out and the bar side is fun with all the upbeat 80's music. I used to go to the bar when it was a separate establishment called Paradise Lounge. I probably have been here over 100 times. I have been in a Chef in AZ for 25 years and I know good quality ingredients when I taste them. This is the place."}
{"text":"I have been to Shogun twice in the last 2 months, and love the quality an portions.  Last night they had a classic rock band and threw the happy hour into full force for it..  This was the first night that I ordered anything other than \"The cold stuff\", and got a teriyaki bowl along with a few pieces of nigiri.  The bowl was great...but once again the big pieces of nigiri style sushi were fantastic.  I have been to Sushi Brokers (good), RA (also good) as well as Satori and a Stingray etc...  Quality wise, Shogun is the best.    BUT  And I love this...but the atmosphere is completely different than any of these other \"Trendy\" sushi choices.  There isnt a whole lot of ZEN floating around and I think that it used to be a Hibachi style grill in the past.  Still...the bar area is a completely non-pretentious, regular bar.  They also have a sushi bar in the center...but I have just stayed at the bar the two times that I have been there.  Both times I have made great friends up there and the bartender is on top of everything.  It's dimly lit and feels like a regular working class bar with the added gift of the best sushi I have had.   They definitely take their sushi seriously.  Thats a good thing...cause so do I!  See you soon!"}
{"text":"I am downgrading my last rating of 3 stars.  Some time ago, I stopped going to Shogun because of an unfortunate fish incident.  Time passed, and my husband and I recently decided to give their Happy Hour a try.  We parked the car, walked toward the door, and were hit with a bad oil smell that completely changed our minds."}
{"text":"Shogun has been in the valley for over 20 years now.  This restaurant has gone through ups and downs and many changes of ownership, but still has some of the best sushi and japanese food in the city.  Try the Valentine Roll if you like tuna.  Try the spicy Godzilla Tails over rice or noodles if you like chicken.  It's a chill atmosphere.  But alas, I am gripped by nostalgia - it wasn't what it once was, but it'll do when you're craving a good donburi (rice bowl)."}
{"text":"Food: thee stars. Service: one star. Chef: three stars.   Details: right off the bat, the waiter made bizarre comments as a disabled customer tried to navigate the extremely cramped quarters. Not a good start.   The waiter was all up in the Chef's space. It was just annoying. The food was good, the chef was entertaining and nice. For some reason, however, our dining experience took an hour and a half plus. That's skipping the sherbert that the waiter called ice cream a dozen times.   I really wanted to stretch my legs after sitting in such tight quarters for so long, but I couldn't put my legs under the table or push my chair back bc the person behind me was too close to our table. It's so cramped.   The restrooms are an experience all their own. Very small. Not very clean. Bi-fold doors that do not lock. SMALL!   The food was ok, but not sure I'll make plans to head back soon."}
{"text":"Jaime is the best. The service from him was awesome. He makes the most delicious sushi!"}
{"text":"We came here based on a recommendation from some friends. The place was rather busy - steady - when we were there. I was expecting some great experience after we were seated. My first impression was that it was very very very casual, not tidy and spotless like a Japanese restaurant should be. The space desparately needed updating and cleaning. Then came the food. It was a huge let down - not at all fresh. There is no art in preparing their sushi. The rice was so hard and not moist like sushi should have. Sometimes you can go to a dive and get really good food. But not here."}
{"text":"Sushi is always good we have been coming here for atleast a couple of years ....i recently made a reservation for my girlftiends birthday . And as soon as we all showed up and explained our reservation they said no ..not sorry or ill see what i could do or nothing ...tbey didn't even check ...worst customer service ever and very rude ...it was the tall blond stoner host ...and then when we sat at our table the waitress completely ignored us ...we wont be back"}
{"text":"This used to be the place to go 10-15 years ago and apparently they are still using the same plates chairs forks etc. It's just plain run down the restrooms were so run down & nasty my 8 year old son stepped in and turned around and said he would wait until we got home.   They had 2 cooks on a Saturday evening so service was super slow.  I ordered jumbo shrimp and they were so over cooked I couldn't eat them. We had to ask the cook to wipe the cooking area down as it had rice all over it from the previous party.   I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"i went here last week for ayce lunch, terrible food quality and service!! the Salmon sushi is not fresh and did not come until last. Sushi Mountain 1 block away is muchh better"}
{"text":"I first came to Shogun on one of my first visits to Québec around 2008-2009. I can completely corroborate Sharm D.'s version of events because they happened to my party of about 12. Now my francophone family (with the exception being my wife) seemed to be in on the \"gag\" so I am not completely sure if this was something that was part of the dining \"experience\". It certainly overshadowed the rest of my evening but the chef did spray sesame seeds in the same manner as previously described towards my sister-in-law.   The food is alright, I am not sure if it justifies the high price tag especially when the seafood is way overcooked. The \"show\" is almost identical to the one at Benihanas back home.  I am guessing that is part of the \"charm\" of this place. It is expensive, has an aquarium of sad-looking fish and has some odd ceiling bulges. It looks like a fairly run down building which is slightly surprising since a lot of Québec restaurant culture almost demands decent renovations every so often, hell, the Tim Hortons down the way from me was completely remodeled. With our meal for 2 we were served room temperature water and sodas with unexceptional \"Japanese\" onion soup. I would sooner try a place in Chinatown proper next time but live and learn."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for almost 20 years.  We have eaten all over the US and have never found a better sushi restaurant than this one.  They have a great variety of sushi, very fresh and affordable.  This place rocks!!"}
{"text":"This is a place clearly in decline.  Last visit there was about eight years ago and it was just okay then.  Decided it was time to give it another try.  The sushi from Fry's grocery store is actually a little better.  The decor is suffering, staff are mostly indifferent and it feels like no one there cares any more.  Much better sushi at Yasu Sushi Bistro near Target on Cactus.  That will be our last visit."}
{"text":"A few days after my original review the manager wrote me a private message on Yelp with an apology, stating that they had a turn over in their wait staff because they were graduating college.  Then the manager offer to mail me a coupon for a meal on them.    I supplied my mailing address, and heard nothing more from the manager, and no coupon in the mail.   Been almost a month ...   Can you give a Negative Star?"}
{"text":"I had a party of 14.we waited 1 hour.i asked waitress to move things along, drinks or a table,she complained. She brought soup and skipped me, I got last bowl of soup w/ hair in it,never again."}
{"text":"1. I ordered a bloody ceasar and the lemon hanging in the glass was all shriveled up, it honestly looked like it was cut a week prior. It was really gross. When brought to server's attention, she  brought me new lemon wedges but showed no embarrassment or apologetic feeling.  2. The miso soup, although serviceable, had no authenticity to it. The fried onions were the packaged, pre-made kind that many use to top their green bean casserole at Thanksgiving.  3. The seafood was way, way overcooked. 4.  The meat and veggies were not bad, thank goodness.  5. The place hasn't been renovated since the 80's. While decor doesn't usually bother me if the food and price are great, for the price point here the place is just gross (stinky carpets, bathroom, moldy fish tank in the entryway right next to where the sushi is made come to mind).  6.  The employees take absolutely no pride in their work. Especially the chefs. I've been to other places like this elsewhere in N. America and the chefs do their dog and poney show with obvious pride and show off their fast and furious knife skills. Not here at Shogun. Our chef was literally working in slow-motion and appeared somewhat drunk. As he plated some veggies across the table from us, he spilled sauce all over this poor woman's plate and table front. Needless to say, no apology or offer to switch plates or get it cleaned up for her.  7.  My kids had a fun evening out.  8. The dessert was the lowest possible quality of orange-cream sherbet , vintage grocery store straight from the 80's.  9. The place was fairly full on a Weekend evening. I don't know how they manage to get customers in. I suspect their repeat customers are mostly coming for the nostalgia. I suspect the place was quite innovative for their time when they first opened but if they want to survive, a young family member needs to take over the management and modernize desperately (service, staffing, food, and facilities)."}
{"text":"nice service and food...recommend happy hour and lounch"}
{"text":"The floor was covered in edamame. They apologized for it and that they just had kids in.  Still, they could have sat us in any other booth so we didn't have to walk through it and they didn't bother sweeping it up until we were nearly done eating.  They also took a really long time to bring the food and check.  They didn't have basics, like Inari.  There weren't many people in the place for lunch and still everything took a really long time.  The sushi didn't really taste all that great either.  I'm not a sushi snob - but after living on the west coast for several years, I can definitely recognize sushi that is below par.  So much for letting my mother (originally from the Midwest) pick the sushi place when I visited.  She chose it as a place where she could get a chicken salad.  If you want a chicken salad, I'm sure there are better places.  If you want sushi, definitely pick someplace else."}
{"text":"I'm literally yelping 10 minutes after leaving this place because it really blows ass.... This is even bad by shitty strip mall sushi standards. I wanted to make it my neighborhood cheap sushi place (cuz its nice to have a cheap sushi place where they know you and you know that its not gonna be great but it'll do when you want sushi and dont wanna spend too much), but this ain't it....  First off, I have a thing about filling out the stupid fucking check sheets all cheap, shitty sushi bars want you to fill out. NUMBER ONE, THEY HAVE ALL THE NAMES THEY MADE UP OF ALL THE SHIT THEY MAKE BUT NO EXPLANATION OF WHAT THEY ARE! WHAT THE HELL IS A SUNSHINE ROLL ANYWAY? So, I sit down, introduce myself  with a smile and ask the name of the sushi guy. I explain that I'd rather just have him tell me whats fresh and explain what kinds of things I like and would he mind just taking care of if. Simple enough in a empty goddamn sushi bar right? NO!!!! He basically tells me, if you don't fill out my stupid fucking directions, I'm not smart enough to prepare you sushi.  Not wanting to be a complete butt hole and stand up, leave and go to Yasu where they have a clue (a decision I am now regretting) I smile, fill out the sheet and wait for what I expect, the same ol shit you get at every strip mall sushi bar in the country..... To cap it off, my girl and I had one cocktail each, a total of 2 nigiri orders and 4 rolls...... IT WAS $100 DOLLARS.... I HAVE NO PROBLEM SPENDING EVEN TWICE THAT MUCH. BUT FOR A CRAP VERSION OF STRIP MALL SUSHI??? NO WAY... THIS PLACE JUST BLOWS... NOT A JAPANESE GUY EXISTS WITHIN TWO BLOCKS OF THIS PLACE...THE CLOSEST JAPANESE GUY IS TWO BLOCKS AWAY AT YASU. HELL, THERE ISNT EVEN A KOREAN GUY IN THIS PLACE.... RIDICULOUS...."}
{"text":"Being a first timer here, we were impressed with the size and atmosphere of the restaraunt. Not your typical sushi joint. There was a separate bar area with multiple TV's showing the Monday night football game, and even some TV's in the dining area. It was busy which is always a good sign! Overall our sushi was pretty good. Your typical rolls were on the menu, along with some specialty rolls. Prices were decent too.  The best part of the night was their happy hour, 25 cent tap beers. Can't beat that!! I'm not sure what HH specials they run other nights, but Monday nights are definitely a winner with us."}
{"text":"I don't expect much when grabbing lunch at a mall, but I expect better than this.  The seaweed salad was a generic overly soy tasting disappointment, the rainbow roll was barely worth eating - the shrimp on the roll tasted fishy, the fish was mealy-textured, and the rich was soft and too sticky.  The yellow tail roll suffered from the same, and we luckily were cautious enough not to try sashimi.  The miso soup was served barely like warm.  The tea was served barely luke warm. That was when we finally got service, which took a veritable eternity.  Tea refills?  Good luck on getting someone's attention for that.  The inside is a dismal, cavernous sport-bar/pool hall sort of feel.  Basically no redeeming features here."}
{"text":"I'm giving this two stars only because our server was great.  We went for happy hour and perhaps that was the problem...the spicy tuna roll wasn't spicy and tasted like they made it yesterday.  The tuna tataki didn't taste fresh and was rather bland.  We tried the inferno roll, but i could barely taste it through all the mayo.  On a positive note, the Godzilla tails were pretty tasty.  Sorry Shogun, you can do better!"}
{"text":"Not a terrible dining experience, but certainly not an upper tier establishment."}
{"text":"Sushi was a little cold and food came slowly (and we were the only ones there). Fried rice was OK, too much pepper. But the side dishes and the teriyaki beef and chicken were amazing, very well done. In general, it was OK, kind of good. Not worth 19$ though. I might go again but later in the day ( I went at 4:00 ), when there might be more employees making the food. Also, the artwork on the walls was really nice and a great aspect to the dinner ( it was a giant mural that covered the walls of the entire eating area of Japanese fishers out at sea)."}
{"text":"Service was less than professional.  came twice in one week with family form out of town. our order was wrong twice.  server just didn't care."}
{"text":"My wife stopped in and grabbed some takeout, not sure how much she looked at what they posted on their menu?  It was actually really good sushi, then I looked at the bill.  There was a 15% \"Sushi Tax\". I called to see if they informed people they were adding 15%, that was a tip for the sushi chef, not the server, and she said it was posted.  I may be wrong, but I thought you were supposed to also tell people verbally that money was added to the bill.  Regardless, I was told it's posted all over the place and they have different levels (5% if sitting at sushi bar).    I find this to be a little under-handed and I'm disappointed as I enjoyed the sushi, best we've had since moving to the area.  We won't go back when restaurants aren't 100% up front about what they add on the bill."}
{"text":"Worst service ever never going back.  Couldn't get a refill took two hours to get food"}
{"text":"When I first moved here 15 years ago, this was a great place. It has gone downhill so much that I cannot reccomend it at all. I don't think anyone in the kitchen is Japanese, and the cooks dont know how to prepare basic dishes, such as tempura.  If you order shrimp tempura (hi $$$), you will only get 2 medium size shrimps on your plate. I asked if this was a normal amount to find on the shrimp tempura entree - and was told \"yes only two\". The fried batter was oily and not crispy as one expects with tempura, and the vegetables inside were mushy and tasteless. Some of the pieces i could not even identify. The miso soup was tasty but room temperature. My chicken katsu was hard and dry, and I had to wait a long time to get a knife to cut it, as we could not find a server to help us. The service was poor. My friend enjoyed his eel sushi, but I did not sample that. I think there must be better Japanese places to eat. The place is often crowded - so I believe many patrons just don't know what good Japanese food should taste like! And the owners probably don't care about the poor quality as long as they get tourists who show up and pay their bill."}
{"text":"Warning: I hold objectivity in high esteem and try to approach all my restaurant experiences with open eyes.  I am not a hater. However, there were some inexcusable events that took place at this restaurant that left me utterly shocked and offended.  It may also irk some of you other readers out there so please be warned.  I came in with good spirits and left in a traumatized huff.  Perhaps it was because it was the 2nd service on a Saturday night, or maybe it was our drunk chef (and he wasn't the only one drunk on staff), or perhaps the poor quality of the food (could it be the fault of the slurring chef?), or the sexual harassment (yes) that was imparted by the chef, but this night goes down in my personal history of bad nights out on the town.  Here is a brief run-down of the \"experience\".  Service: - Made reservations for 8. Got seated at 8:30 and were asked to move after being seated. No apologies were made. Not an efficient system.  - The chef showed up at 9:15, took a few shots, and left.  Another chef strolled out with his cart and crashed it into the wall.  His eyes were glassy and he took a shot.  Things seem circumspect.  While the staff seemed to access the bar quite easily, it took me a good hour and a half to get my first drink (which was very watery).  - First course: the chef finally comes around again and begins the first service.  It's a bowl of \"Japanese Onion Soup.\"  It was a timid broth with traces of tasteless mushroom, scallions, and fried onion that tasted suspiciously like the prepared fried onion you can buy in a bag at cheapo grocery stores.  - Second course: we received a salad that looked like someone had blew chunks onto it.  After further inspection, I discovered that it was a bunch of ice berg lettuce, a tangerine (?), a tomato slice, and a mountain of what tasted like Bic Mac sauce.   - The rest of the meal: very mediocre.  The steak was overdone, the seasonings were very Americanized, and the seafood was rubbery (I had the lobster and shrimp).  The chef assumed that no one wanted dessert (included in the meal) so we had to request the dessert which we had already paid for.  Fail.  - THE BIGGEST FAILURE OF THE EVENING:  The chef purposely threw sesame seeds into the shirt of one of the female clients sitting with us.  It shocked everyone at the table (demeaning, a little?).  As he drank more, he decided to do the same to another woman at our table.  Her shirt was to her neck, so he took the liberty of pulling her shirt away from her chest (!) and threw some sesame seeds into her shirt.  Later on in the night, he asked me \"are you jealous?\" and attempted to put some sesame seeds into MY shirt.  I was so disgusted by this behaviour but maintained composure so as not to draw attention to myself.  BUT WAIT... there's more...  The final act of shame was at the very end of the service, the chef came around to his first victim when her boyfriend was conveniently in the washroom.  It sounds like a horror story, but he openly put his hand down her shirt and yelled  \"shake shake!\".  We were all so shocked at the table, and the woman was trying to get his hand out of her shirt... I felt really sad for her and angry at this disgusting display.  I don't know how he was able to \"get away\" with this molestation but I left immediately after that.  I don't know what happened to the woman who got groped.  I needed some time to \"debrief\" after that event, as I was honestly shocked by what happened.  I will be making a formal complaint to this restaurant about the staff because what happened is harassment.  Nothing short of firing the chef would make up for what happened..."}
{"text":"Shogun is my one and only sushi spot. I've tried their lunch specials, dinner & happy hour. It's affordable and their service is always prompt. The menu has something for everyone! They have great prices, amazing quality every single time, and the best staff. They are always willing to make a recommendation or omit ingredients to keep me satisfied. I have had superb service from the manager, Kevin, the sweetheart bartender, Jess, the hilarious waiter, Josh, and the very skilled sushi chef Paco.  These folks really know how to take care of their patrons. They have a beautiful patio with a fireplace also. I highly recommend giving Shogun a try, you will see what I mean."}
{"text":"Shogun is typically my second choice for sushi, but that being said this place is still great. The service is really good too, which is what makes me keep coming back. Ingredients are fresh, and definitely check out happy hour for some great deals on drinks. A bit pricey, but a nice splurge now and then."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Shogun for the past couple years, the food is great and is one of my favorite places to get sushi.  Highly recommend their Godzilla Tails and the Chimichanga rolls are great!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've been here and the sushi chef still remember what we both ordered. So cool. And the sushi is still amazingly fresh. Love this place."}
{"text":"Average Sushi. Can't pinpoint what, but something was missing from it.  We had the Philly roll and Cali roll. Def not the best I've ever had. And the Edamame had a weird smell/taste to it. Like it had been either sitting around or over cooked. Pretty sure I won't be going back. Oh, and they charge you a 5% sushi tax.  Not sure what that for but I saw abut her reviewer mentioned it too."}
{"text":"Love this place for a consistent, great menu. The Godzilla tails, huge sushi menu and saki bombers, the best. Eat in the bar or dining room, but the bar has a real neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"Really good Sushi and Happy Hour. You won't be disappointed. We also like sitting at the Sushi Bar and interacting with the Chef's who also school us on other kind of sushi."}
{"text":"It's ok. I've come here and been wowed by the sushi then other times I can't really say either way.   Today we had the miso soup and it was ok. Edamame was good though messing that up would take some work. Our teriyaki chicken is delicious and the turkey salad as well. Waitress is nice and so is everyone else.  I'll give it two stars due to average food and environment.   Btw everyone swears by the Godzilla tails which are just super small strips of chicken in what I liken to a buffalo sauce. Ehhh cheap if you ask me. But hey they work.  I'll end with its worth a try:)"}
{"text":"Sushi In Arizona? Yup! Shogun is your answer!!  Coming from Orange County CA  I can tell you this is my sushi spot!! Only place where I will eat sushi at. RA and all these other cookie cutter joints have nothing on the quality and taste shogun offers!"}
{"text":"Went here Saturday night around 7. Me and my wife were in the waiting area and they staff ignored us completely. We were there for about 15 minutes and they looked at me a couple times as they walked through the waiting area but never acknowledged us. The restaurant was really dirty to the point that our shoes were sticking to the floor. Vents were very nasty and we're held together with duck tape. We decided to leave after the 15 minutes in the waiting area."}
{"text":"This place is far from any Sho gun I've been to. My roll was terrible. Boring, bland, not spicy like described, too warm and avocados were brown. Tasted like grocery store sushi. Kids meal was good, tempura...veggies were good but seafood was not. I will not go back here. Hostess and other servers seemed nice, mine had no personality and did not know the menu at all. I sure miss California sushi places. Any suggestions? Phoenix area???"}
{"text":"The service is awful especially at the bar.  You practically have to tackle someone to get a drink, and it gets really tiresome looking around for your server to get a refill of ice tea, and nobody seems to care if you complain.  Why do I keep coming back??  The spicy tuna handroll is the best in town, the turkey salad is one of my favorites, and a chicken sandwich that is to die for.  As long as I stick with what I know I'm fine (though there are some inconsistencies.)  The place needs to be remodeled, and someone who works there has to pretend they give a damn about the food, service, or the customers in order for me to continue coming."}
{"text":"I went for lunch at about 2 pm and ordered the steak lunchbox. It was delicious! I was seated promptly and my order taken in a timely manner, server was polite. My food came much quicker then expected and the  bill was pretty much what i expected to pay $15 and i also had tea. The portion size was generous enough for lunch and glad i didn't add anything extra. Decor was nice. Overall i was very pleased. If you're from out of town it's a good excuse to do your passport application in person! (Shogun right across the st. from Whitby mall)"}
{"text":"Had lunch  with my grandson Julian. We had the chicken katsu and it was wonderful. We had the new Las Vegas roll, which Julian loves and we also have a Dragon Roll and that pretty much is going to go home with us. Joshua was a very good waiter. thank you for another awesome lunch"}
{"text":"Food is great and sushi well priced for what you get as compared to other local sushi places. Service is decent hence the 4 stars. Otherwise, visit and enjoy especially for the sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Terrible! Service was blatantly rude and unattentative, they encourage you to sign up for their email list and then when you inquire about the emailed advertisements they won't honor them. Happy hour menu has only 3 sushi rolls, they ran out of draft beers (which were on special or $3, then charged us $5 for the same beer in a bottle), food was so-so, and they charge a 5% tax per bill for dining in. This was my second trip and I am very unimpressed, will not be returning!!!"}
{"text":"I signed up on yelp just do dog this place!! Literally writing this review as I'm dining. This is my second time here. First experience was just as bad. I live a block away and I love sushi but the service here sucks!! Can't do it again. Save yourself the headache and your money. Must have been a handful of people dining and it took 15 min to get a server. Skunky domestic beers....seriously born on date was October. Ordered tuna sashimi.....fish was cut like steak and smelled like shit. So mad right now. U like sushi? Honestly drive to 16th St and glendale, place called Moto!! You'll see what sushi should look and taste like"}
{"text":"I took my mother here for Mother's Day. The place was nice and full at around 6pm but there was no wait, and we were seated right away. The server was very nice and super cute. She also kept our water and iced tea filled up the entire time we were there.  Wait for the food was a bit on the long side, but it says on the menu to be prepared to wait up to 60 minutes. I wasn't bothered by this because it gave me a chance to spend some quality time with the Mom, and it sorta just flew by.  When the sushi came out, it was well worth the wait. Across the board, my mother and I agreed that, it was some of the best sushi we've ever had. We ordered 2 spicy tuna hand rolls (which were huge and stuffed with generous amounts of tuna). We also had the neon roll, a regular tuna roll, rainbow roll, salmon roll, and a soft-shell crab roll. By mistake, they also brought us an extra tuna roll. I pointed out to the server, and she let us have it for no charge.  We left nothing on our plates. Not even the pickled ginger.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Favorite Restaurant of all times. My family has been eating at Shogun for 27 years. Back then they were the only Japanese restaurant in Phx. We have tried a lot of them as they would open and we have left kicking ourselves in the ass for wasting our money and being disappointed. we are a family of 7 and we all have our favorites. chicken Katsu for me Shogun chicken for my pops, mom goes for the rolls Sunshine roll tops her list but many other rolls are close behind, my sister craves the turkey salad like a crack head ( she lives in TX and always straight from the airport to Shogun) little brother usually gets the Godzilla Tails and the twins get the shrimp with veggies tempura. If you have never had Shogun do yourself a favor and give them a visit you wont kick yourself in the ass when your done."}
{"text":"Terrible service. It started out great until the first meal came out and after 10 min waiting for the rest of the dinners our friend went ahead and started their meal as it was getting cold. Patrons seated after us were close to finishing their meals before we could flag down the bartender because the waitress was busy else where. 30 min later we get the rest of the dinners. So much for enjoying dinner TOGETHER with friends.   The waitress then comes to let us know its on its way but would be happy to give us complimentary miso soup  really?  We had our $1 miso soup already so no thank you we would like our food.   Manager comes to our table and thought she was coming to address  the problem as I can see the bartender addressing it with the kitchen as it seemed the order was not placed for our rolls. No she asked if we needed drinks, ordered only for her to come back that they were out of armarreto . She had the alternate drink made and never came or addressed the issue.   Disappointed with the service! At that point the food was soured so cant review the food."}
{"text":"Worst sushi I've ever had. I guess you get what you pay for, but I thought that since it was the \"oldest Japanese restaurant in Phoenix\", that it might be good. The staff messed up our order and then when we got the missing roll, argued about it's quality (poor). I will never go here again."}
{"text":"I've had Shogun quite a few times since I discovered it 6 months ago.  The sushi is always good and I love the Shogun chicken.  Godzilla tails are amazing and I find myself getting a craving for them at least once a week.  The food is great and the staff is excellent as well.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love the chicken katsu! What I always get when i come here!  Give it a 4 star because the staff always forgets something from our order. Other than that my chicken katsu is great. But they are fast most of the time w/ our food"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've ever written a review on Yelp but I felt compelled to do so.  My husband and I ate dinner there on Sat. night.  When we got our check, I noticed that there was a 5% charge for our sushi.  We had ordered 2 rolls. What japanese restaurant charges an extra 5% for sushi?  This is a Japanese restaurant, they serve Japanese food and sushi.....am I right?????  So upon questioning the manager about this, her response was \"I'm so sorry\"  about 10 times.  When i eat pasta at an Italian restaurant do they charge me 5% extra for the pasta???  Not a way to run your business.  If you have to pay your sushi chefs extra, change your menu prices to reflect that.  I also found out that they charge you 15% extra when you take out.  Really????? They lost me as a customer and wonder how many others don't go there for the same reason."}
{"text":"J ai été agréablement surpris, le concept est convivial, l ambiance est super, le personnel est courtois, le decor aurais besoin de rafraichissement, mais la nourriture étais délicieuse, et le rapport qualité prix est excellent, je suis allez avec un ami un mardi soir, pour 59$ pour 2 personne avec une consommation chaque  inclus ...repas complet , bonne portion , et le chef cuisine a ta table..."}
{"text":"Great food, nice staff, and an ample sushi bar. Try the tuna crunch roll and the generous and tasty salmon sashimi.  Don't forget to start with a reasonably priced and good sized Tito's, up with a lemon twist!"}
{"text":"As with most of these type showie restaurants it was the usual fair.  fast seared steak, chicken and shrimp.     The disappointment was the saute cabbage, for the amount of money generally shelled out I expected Savoy or Bok Choy.  Wow me surprise me and start uping the anti on the Veggies.. give me choice  If I was vegetarian I would be truely upset with peas carrots, onion, zucchini and mushrooms."}
{"text":"Was at the restaurant for at least two hours. Waitress messed up the order, meanwhile it took an hour and a half for our sushi. The other parts of the meal came out within 25 min or so. We then asked for our sushi to be comped because they then later forgot to bring us a roll. They then proceeded to only comp our miso soup and cucumber salad. We saved a whopping 14 dollars.... I have been going there with my family for a long time and I have never seen customer service this bad in my lifetime."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in whitby. Staff are always friendly and food always great. It's also normally quite every time we go which i like."}
{"text":"Went in on a Thursday with my son for dinner at around 7:30pm. Place was empty, we were the only customers. One of the chefs were off to the side eating dinner himself. No big deal.   Normally, I am very hesitant to eat at a place that has little or no activity, my thinking being that any food in the kitchen has been sitting for a while and will just get reheated. However, we were hungry and tired, and had already been to our usual choice sushi buffet (Sushi Today- Formerly Go believe Sushi)  down the street recently and wanted to try Shogun for the first time.   We ordered off a printed text only sheet using a pencil. Old Skool - no biggie though , but I had to ask for the ala-carte menu to see some images as I couldn't remember what some of the sushi rolls looked like or contained. Didn't help much as the menu has some example pics and wasn't very illustrated at all. The ipad ordering system like some of the other sushi buffets have adopted is the best thing since sliced bread I tell you!    Anyway, we ordered the calamari tempura, shrimp tempura and veg tempura for starters, my son ordered a cucumber hand roll.   When those came out we dug in immediately, my son worked on his hand roll, I went for the shrimp then one bite of the calamari.   The calamari tasted funny.   I smelled the calamari and it actually smelled rotten!   I have had calamari countless times before and NEVER had I smelled it this bad. It was actually spoiled.  I pushed the plate to the far end of the table so the server could take it away and told my son not to touch it. We did however eat the other tempura which was fine.  I was tempted to walk out with my son, but didn't want to get into a confrontation with the staff as we had already started into out meal so I decided to stay and see what the other food was like. When the other food came and everything else was on point. The spicy fried rice and general Tao chicken were generous portions and delicious.  The spicy salmon pizza and spicy crab pizza was great. As was the Alaska roll.   At one point I did mention to our server that the calamari was bad and even smelled bad. She just took it away , I think I got a one word apology, but no offer to replace it or to order something else.   We left satisfied with the other dishes, however the calamari experience will always have me second guessing any future calamari purchases from now on. It also solidified my decision to not come back to Shogun again.  Its a shame because the place has potential- as I said, their other dishes were on point,  I just can't see how they missed the bad Calamari. The chef would have had to have a cold to not smell that rotting seafood. It was vile."}
{"text":"Was craving some chicken katsu so decided to head over with my wife for lunch.  We were seated right away and the waiter stopped by shortly thereafter to take our drink order.  I had the lunch chicken katsu and my wife had the lunch turkey salad and chicken katsu combo.  The meal came out in a timely manner and the food was hot and good.  Our chicken katsu was cooked well - juicy and not dry.  When I eat Japanese and Chinese, I tend to drink a lot of hot tea.  Our waiter did an excellent job of refilling my hot tea on a regular basis so my tea cup was never empty for more than just a few minutes (if it got empty at all).  Con:  When we arrived, we saw a lunch special on the board - Tempura combo with spicy yellowtail roll for $7.  My wife thought about getting this but we noticed that if you order sushi in the dining room, there is a surcharge.  I know it's not much, but the principal of offering a lunch special that includes a sushi roll and then tacking on a surcharge seems stupid.  Not sure why they feel the need to apply a surcharge for sushi ordered in the dinning room when this is a sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"For the love of gawd...what crappy, sub-par sushi that is over priced. Lunch cost me and my girlfriend $70, no specials but one roll and the sushi was equivalent to a buffet style sushi at a cheap oriental place. Just to get the taste out of our mouths and get our sushi fix we went to Stingray in Old town Scottsdale and the quality, service, larger portions and lower cost turned it all around for us."}
{"text":"My family eats sushi regularly and we live in Southern California but we are Arizona natives. We ate at Shogun last night and my overall review would be, with the exception of the very good service, the meal was mediocre at best. Sushi wasn't fresh - not even the salmon which is pretty hard to screw up. The miso soup was cold and the salads bland. There are a lot of other places for sushi, including the grocery store that are better than this place."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The bartender tonight (Jesse I believe) didn't even greet us. She was preoccupied by cleaning and getting out of the restaurant before 10pm. I had to ask for specials and happy hour. She didn't suggest anything , I ordered coconut shrimp which was a roll and not an appetizer  and didn't check on us and see how we liked our food. I'm a huge sushi person and I wanted to try this place out but I will never be back. The worst $55 I spent ever, I have been a bartender for 8 years but not the point, I understand in certain situations. They have no concept of running a restaurant. They were putting up the bar stools on the bar while I'm still eating and mopping the bar floor, gross. I felt  uninvited  and I felt like I was being kicked out.  Poor poor poor."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Teppanyaki was so good. A favorite for birthday celebrations. Will go again."}
{"text":"Not sure where all of the other reviewers on this site go for sushi, but I found Shogun to be right in the middle of the road for pricing.  Cheaper than Sapporo, Ra & Ah-So but a little more expensive than your traditional mom & pop sushi.  I say if you want to be seen in your micro mini with your gel head boyfriend than head to one of the aforementioned places.  If you want good sushi in a comfortable & fun setting than I would suggest Shogun.  I have been going here for nearly 20 years, well before they bought out the other side and built the bar area.  The sushi bar is always the way to go as you can be in and out in 20 minutes.  They have a fun little patio for groups (when it's not 115 outside).  I'd much rather support this establishment that has been locally owned forever than head out to another cookie cutter sushi chain."}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi bar in the valley. The service is always amazing plus its a great spot for happy hour too!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!  We tried a bit of everything when we went. I had Shogun Chicken and Chicken Katsu. Both were AMAZING. I love this place because they have a very FULL menu. Not only sushi. Also the Godzilla Tails are killer. Theyre tiny pieces of buffalo chicken. Delicious. Seriously awesome food."}
{"text":"If I can give this place a \"0\" star, I would. The spicy tuna roll I ordered was legit from Sprouts next door in their sushi isle. It wasn't a spicy tuna roll either. Ordered some noodle dish and it was just veggies, noodle and soy sauce. My mom who normally doesn't complain said we should have said something...  It's like I can't even begin to explain how bad it was...so sad..."}
{"text":"I had shogun with a friend who had introduced me and I loved it the first time when we had take out. The coconut shrimp is great. I just came here with my boyfriend cause I wanted to turn him onto sushi and it was a fail because he doesn't eat sushi but I do and now he still doesn't like it. For me,The sushi is good not great the second time I had it. Service is okay I'm sure my server was exhausted because you could definitely tell. I might come  back next time I am craving sushi I dunno"}
{"text":"Consistently good sushi, and great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Heard good things about the place, came over for the first time Monday at ~8pm the place was full and we got seated quickly, after sitting for 10 minutes, we asked to have a waiter come over to our table, after sitting another 5 minutes without even getting water, we decided to leave as they were clearly too busy to handle additional customers (and they didn't seem to mind we left)."}
{"text":"Worst sushi I've ever had- piles of rice and imitation crab meat is all I can recall."}
{"text":"Value and Food was really good but the service was by far the worst I've experienced.  It is like the place is full of amateurs, our water and drinks were never refilled, ordered food never received and it seems like we were not the only ones who noticed how terrible the service was!!! Def not going back."}
{"text":"The service was slow to get the food out,  but was well worth the wait. The turkey salad was wonderful. Get the big size and share with someone. The california rolls with soy paper were melt in your mouth wonderful. Will be back for sure for the same order!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. This is where I first had sushi for the first time when I was 17, and it's still my favorite. It has a neighborhood feel to it, so it's not fancy, but its delicious and local and inviting. For sushi: yellowtail sashimi is always perfect here, the Surfer Roll will change your life, and their spicy tuna and spicy yellowtail rolls are in no way spicy, but are definitely delicious. Also a big fan of the crunchy roll, and this is the only place I've had an Alaskan roll that I actually liked.  If you aren't in the mood for sushi-- the chicken katsu here is perfect in every way, and the Godzilla tails are so good I once had a dream that I was eating them. My husband always gets the Mikan Toriniku (but with noodles instead of rice, even better) and swears by it. Top it all off at the end with a scoop of green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"Just got back from Shogun. In a word, I would describe my experience as horrible. We arrived a few minutes after 6pm. We waited in the waiting area for about 10 minutes before even being acknowledged to put our name on the waiting list. After that we waited another 6 or 7 minutes to be seated. Then we waited forever to give a drink order, our server made the comment that we had been there long enough that should know what we wanted, which we did and she took our food order as well. We waited almost 40 minutes to get our cup of miso soup. Our chef came out shortly after 7pm. Our salad which consisted of lettuce and shrimp sauce came after our chef came out. My wife asked for a refill of ours and the kids drinks. The server filled everyone else's drink but not hers and that was the only time that she refilled our drinks and there were two other parties at our table. She was finally able to get her to refill her drink and that was the last time she came to our table until it was time to hand out the checks. She claimed she had 4 tables and that the others were upstairs. It was some of the worst service I've had in years. The chef on the other hand cooked a good meal and was entertaining and nice. He did not make up for the ridiculous wait and extremely poor service though. The only reason that a tip was left was because the server and the chef share tips. Also management is nonexistent. The person that I would assume is the owner is the one who took my name after ignoring me for 10 minutes. No apologies offered no nothing. I will not be back."}
{"text":"We have been here many times over the years, but our experience on Saturday was not good.  Our \"chef\" was very young and inexperienced, and quite arrogant.  He interrupted every conversation at our table as if we were there to keep him entertained.  The food he made was awful, dripping in extremely salty soy sauce; it was almost inedible. He kept trying the Japanese grill tricks and failing at every single one of them, then tried to cover up his failures by making racist comments about different cultures after each failure.  What a loser.  He splashed soy sauce on our clothes, too. Overall, he thought he was very suave, but in reality quite childish and inexperienced, and bordering on belligerent. He was a total jerk.  For some reason the person who cleans up after the \"chef\" decided to perform that task before we were even done eating, and we were all doused in an unbelievable amount of steam and cooking solution. We wreaked of the place by the time we left. We couldn't even see the people sitting at the other end of the table because of all the steam produced.  We had to lean back from the grill because it was hard to breathe.  It was a very bad experience.  Beware - they automatically charged the gratuity for our party, then  disposed of the receipt when it came time to settle the bill, so I had to ask for a duplicate receipt to verify the amount.  Very deceptive practice.  The chair backs were sticky from not being cleaned. If only they focused a little of that grill cleaning attention on cleaning the other surfaces in the restaurant. We will not be back to this place."}
{"text":"Very nice sushi bar and restaurant. Service is unusually good for the valley and the Shumi is to die for. The sushi is passable nothing outstanding. Location is kinda weird but once inside the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi here and what I love about this place is they will customize your rolls to what you like. Alex was a phenomenal chef. I'm thinking this is going to be our new favorite spot everything has been so delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Shogun is one of my favorite places to hang out and eat great sushi I have been going there since 1997. My favorite inside out rolls are the \"Sunset Roll\", \"Surfer Roll\" \"Sunshine Roll\" \"Sunset\" \"Caterpillar Roll\". My favorite hand rolls would be the \"Soft Shell Crab Hand Roll\" \"Spicy Tuna Hand Roll\" \"Spicy Wahoo Roll\". My favorite sashimi would be the yellowtail sashimi with orange roe, scallions and ponzu sauce.  If you stop by for lunch try a salmon sunomono for $10 it is very refreshing and it will fill you up."}
{"text":"I have been going to Shogun for over 10 years. Some of my favorites are the sunshine roll, chicken katsu and tempura. Very chill restaurant with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I have never waited this long to be seated before. Also, I have never waited this long to have my drink order taken before at any establishment, anywhere, at any point in my life. The waiter (whichever one was ours) either had a legitimate disability or was ailed by sever idiocy, as he couldn't understand that we actually wanted our orders taken even after prompted.  My party could've driven to Charlotte, eaten, and returned home within the amount of time it took for us to receive our food here. My wife and I most certainly will not return...   Update: I, along with 2 other people in my party got very sick, not even 15 minutes after leaving. Since the gestation period for most severe food born illness is 5+ hours, I'd guess that we ingested some spoiled food. I had a great night full of vomiting and restless sleep..."}
{"text":"Wow!  This is a great restaurant for sushi.  The staff was nice and the food was great.  There's a pretty lively atmosphere.  It's a bit on the pricey side but then again, it is sushi.  I definitely recommend going with a group or date ... you will have a blast!"}
{"text":"Shogun might be ruined for me. Me and my friend got sick after the Surfer Roll. Ugh. Haven't had sushi since. :-("}
{"text":"Ok if you are looking for a quick fix of sushi / sashimi, but nothing to go out of your way for. Pleasant staff but a little ho-hum , some strange patrons !  If you want a good sushi bar go to Yasu on E.Cactus ."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi in the valley! I have been coming to Shogun since I was a kid and it is delicious. The portions are large, the quality is excellent. I love all the chef's, but Alex is our favorite! We just tell him to go for it, and we eat whatever he puts in front of us. He has never ceased to amaze us. Shogun rocks! Try the surfer roll if you're hungry; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I were in a sushi mood, but not AYCE. Shogun was the obvious choice. There aren't many a la carte Japanese restaurants around anymore. I know AYCE restaurants offer a la carte, but I find the quality isn't there.   Shogun has a simple décor with tables, booths and 1 large teppanyaki cooking area. In the evening on weekends, there are no seats available for teppanyaki. Go early!  We had spicy tuna, spicy salmon and cucumber avocado rolls. The ingredients were fresh and plentiful. My one friend likes carrot with her a/c roll and the chef was happy to add it to her order free of charge. Our server was knowledgeable and answered any questions we had about their signature rolls. Our only moment of confusion came when the bills didn't. We didn't realize we were to go upto the front to pay. Oops!   Looking for consistently fresh, flavourful Japanese food? Shogun is a safe bet. Their bento boxes are fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm not one to usually flame places, but they deserve it!! I had about the worst experience EVER at Shogun, and I didn't even get a chance to try their food! Went a few Saturdays back for lunch with a friend.  Upon arriving a harried guy told us to just sit anywhere, which we did.  We were catching up and after a bit realized that ~15 minutes had elapsed since we sat down.  No menus, no 'can I get you a drink', nothing.  We sheepishly looked around for our host who was nowhere to be found.  There were some occupied tables, but I would not classify it as 'busy' by any means. I flagged down a sweaty waiter who said that everyone had called in sick and he was doing his best to keep up.  He brought us both iced tea, which we did not order nor did we really want.  Still no menus. After half an hour of sitting there Mr. Sweaty threw menus on our table and assured us he would be right back.  He kept this promise and took our orders.  Tick tock Clarice.... AFTER A SOLID FRICKIN' HOUR we just left."}
{"text":"Yes, my star rating is low, but please read my review to understand why I would still RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT. We opted for the $11.99+tax lunch. It is the same price as Kyoto House and $1 less than most Durham Sushi Restaurants were the going lunch rate is $12.95-12.99. Significantly less than Tatemono type places which run $15.95-19.95 just for lunch (this is the dinner price for most places). The dinner menu has only a few more options on it. I would recommend going before 3:00 pm when the price is bumped up to $20 for the not much better dinner menu and the Tepenyaki rush starts.   Sorry about not taking any pictures, I wanted to but I went with a friend and we always laugh our asses off so I forgot. \"Crabmeat\" is imitation crabmeat.   Okay, so let me list everything we ate:  (nigir is the oval shaped rice with a strip of fish on top, maki is the roll) HR stands for \"hand roll\"  Fried Scallops Salmon Teriyaki Chikcen Tempura Red Snapper nigiri Red Tuna Maki (surpirsing because most placed only offer white tuna with their menu) Futo HR (crab meat, avacado,sweet pickle, cucumber) Lemon Chicken (basically just chicken breast temperua with a lemon sauce) gyoza Sui Mai Salmon Nigiri Crab Meat Nigiri Dynamite Roll (avacado, prawn temperua, cucumber) Another, similar roll (can't remember the name of it but the entire roll was deep fried like the golden rolls) Calamari Inari sushi (I still have no idea what it is, I asked the waitress and she had no idea. The search online calls it fried Tofu pouch but what I was served here was a sheet of sweet, sticky something on rice in a nigiri format)  Let's look at the things I would say I liked Salmon Nigiri, Fresh, balanced  Didn't like  Everything Else  This is actually okay for me, I'm really picky, if I like 1 thing at a menu then it's fine.  Overall, I'd give the food a 4.5/10, but adjusting for the ridiculously low price of $12+tax, I'll bump it up it to 5/10.  My friend was more generous, giving the food 6/10. He didn't try most of the things (mostly because of \"halal\" but also because he was full before a lot of the later stuff came). He loved the crab meat nigiri, and liked the salmon nigiri, calamari, fried scallops, and dynamite roll. He did actually end up trying the chicken tempura hesitantly (despite the halal issue) which he liked, suggesting to me he would have liked the other fried dishes such as the lemon chicken as well.  We both hated the fishy Salmon teriyaki, it was not the same salmon as the salmon nigiri.   Overall the sushi is the best sushi I've had in Durham (I have been to Tatemono, Adora (twice), Oshi Maki, Kyoto House, and now Shogun). It was all technically sound, the rice was cooked well (could have had a bit more vinegar and some wasabi), the slices were thing and even, the rolls were tight, etc. The temperua fried dishes were crispy and light as they should be and the sauces were satisfactory (check my other reviews, this is a compliment).   Just the food for the price, I would give it a 2.5 or 3 stars because the salmon nigiri was the best piece of sushi I have had in Canada (including the $150 per head placed in Toronto) but the service was so slow. The food came out piping hot but slowly and the waitress was inattentive and there was a very apparent language barrier.   So I'm bumping it down to 2 stars. If you want sushi, in Whitby, go here. There are only 8 sushi places in Whitby, I have been to 5 of them and out of those this is number 1).  Edit: Forgot to mention, the decor is beautiful. Hand painted murals of ships and fishermen line the walls. I have a rule about not going to the same restaurant twice for the same food, unless it is exceptional. But I might be trying this place for its Tepenyaki and update my review."}
{"text":"I have eaten weekly at shogun's for the past several years. In the past several months the food and service has continued to decline. After tonight, I will never eat there again. When is the last time your server argues with you? With poor service and better food choices elsewhere, I would suggest you seek your culinary experience at a place you are valued."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been Shogun fans for a few years and when we can, we'll take in a few of the monster-sized rolls, some edamame and Saki and call it a night.  Today I went for the lunch special and was very pleased with the portions and the price.  The Katsu chicken was crisp and not over cooked and the roll was right on target.   We usually feel like we've been well fed, well served and reasonably priced.  The fish is alway fresh, the sushi chefs always accommodating to create a special version of a standard roll and the wait staff kept our glasses filled.  I read some of the other reviews and feel that over the long run, some are off base - this is my perspective from over more than a few years of being a semi-regular dinner."}
{"text":"So as for the food, its great but expensive.  Their filet mignon is excellent and the fried rice is the best I have ever had.  Also the jumbo shrimp is delicious.  Once again, this place is expensive.  Second, the waitresses are very attentive which is a plus but the cooks who cook on the grill top in front of you can be obnoxius.  They will do a little show which is neat at first until you see it 10 times.  The chefs also will flirt with the women and attempt to speak English but no doubt can only say \"How you want your steak\"?  A positive about the chefs is that the food is great.  Therefore, the restaurant is somewhere you go once or twice a year.  You want good, cheaper Japanese that is not quite as good but still good, go to Sake!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in town and worth going just to try the godzilla tails which are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the early 90's and it's always been great. Not so much tonight. Julie the waitress is awful. We have had her before and she just should not be waitressing. The salmon in my Philly roll didn't taste right and it just didn't seem near ad good as in the past. I hope it was just an off night."}
{"text":"I work near Shogun and usually end up going there for lunch multiple times a week.  The first time I went, I was unimpressed and didn't think I would return.  Since then, I have learned where the gems are in their menu and what items should be avoided so the menu items are kinda of hit and miss.  During lunch time (before 2:30pm) they have these amazing specials which help me afford a sushi lunch several times a week.  They have a sushi roll for half off and a combo (usually a roll and teriyaki chicken) for $7.  The rolls in the combo change from day to day and the half off roll is always different from the combo roll.  I usually bring a coworker and we share the an order of the half price roll, the special combo and order an extra bowl of rice.  This usually puts our sushi lunches at $14 together -- making lunch super affordable and always delicious.  Some favorite rolls include the vegas and the tuna crunch roll (especially the tuna crunch roll).  The soft shell crab hand roll is a favorite of a coworker of mine. I'm not fan of any of their rolls that have a tempora/spicy mayonnaise combo (the chimichanga roll comes to mind).  Those are usually too heavy to be enjoyable.  Overall, Shogun isn't amazingly different, but their sushi is good.  Their lunch specials are a steal and the waiter staff is nice and assertive.  I'd also like to note that their regular rice and teriyaki (or other prepared meat) bowls are huge, and are family sized as oppose to individual sized."}
{"text":"Zen 32? Not for me. Stingray? Too expensive.  I'm partial to Shogun. Located conveniently in the Paradise Valley Mall circle, I choose Shogun every year for my official birthday dinner. Rob has been our family's dedicated waiter for over a year now. Every time we walk in, he knows us all by name and remembers our drink orders. (Because everything on the menu is so delicious, our food orders change too often to remember!)  The happy hour prices are the best I've found in the Phoenix area, and the quality of the fish isn't compromised. Best thing on the menu by far? The handrolls! Any flavor! They're humongous. Not like the measly ones served at other restaurants with a sad excuse for some fish and a ton of rice with a lonely stalk of cucumber. No, gigantic. It would be more accurate to say that these are almost as large as an ice cream cone. And they are filled with deliciousness.  I have been coming to Shogun for 8+ years and will continue to do so, as I always leave with a full belly and a happy heart."}
{"text":"I'd sworn off Shogun for a long time.  I used to drive from Central PHX up here just for their Shogun Chicken.  The food has always been awesome, but the last three times I'd been here, the service was beyond abysmal.  One night I'd come in specifically to tie one on with a meal, but I could only manage to get the waitress's attention for three drinks.  Kinda ridiculous.  So I was pleasantly surprised on my last visit.  We were told the table would be 10-15 minutes; we were seated in five.  Iced tea and water never reached empty.  And the food was incredible, as always.  I'm not much of a fish-eater, so I can't reliably rate their sushi, but I've always loved what I've had here. The Chicken Katsu is also very good.  I hope the good service we experienced indicates a wholesale change and was not just an anomaly.  But after being this close to calling it quits on this place entirely (and I've been eating here for 15+ years), they redeemed themselves.  I really hope they keep it up."}
{"text":"Great place for late happy hour drinks and food 5-7 pm. Loved the Saaki Bomb and the atmosphere that is fun but equally private and easy going."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at Shogun. I came with a party of 11 & it looked pretty busy when we first got there, but we got sat right away. Our waiter Zach was by far the best server I've had in a looooong time. He was very friendly, quick, and professional. This guy definitely deserves a raise. Food was delicious & came out surprisingly fast. Will definitely be back next time I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"We had a great dining experience and our waiter, Zach was phenomenal with recommendations. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because we were seated in the \"dining \" section is because the sushi chefs get a cut if they don't serve you directly at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Decided to give it another try after being ticked off when the last time we were charged a gratuity for the sushi chefs, even though we sat in the dining room. I forgot how expensive they are. My husband ordered the turkey salad and I ordered 2 rolls - spicy yellowtail and the Shogun roll which is supposed to be spicy.  Everything we ordered was so bland that if I closed my eyes, I wouldn't had no idea what I was eating. Nothing was spicy, in fact I couldn't tell my 2 rolls apart in taste or appearance. The turkey salad was so bland, it tasted like hospital food.  My spicy bloody mary tasted like tomato juice and vodka.  That's it. We're out. Scratching Shogun off the list."}
{"text":"My husband and I planned a nice night in with food delivered. We ordered Shogun food through Grubhub, and an hour later (when the confirmation text said our food would be delivered) we got a phone call that our delivery was canceled because the delivery service was too busy. I don't know if it was really Shogun or Grubhub, but we are now starving and trying to figure out what to eat that will salvage a romantic evening. It was a big bonus to Shogun that we could get a delivery. We learned our lesson. We won't be using Grubhub again, and Shogun has lost its appeal."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I come here often with my husband and we always sit at the sushi bar.  The rolls and sashimi are always super fresh and tasty.  Consistently excellent quality. Good prices. Definitely one of my favorite sushi spots in the valley."}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to this place for happy hour, we go at least once a week. Great prices on select rolls and drinks.  AND the happy hour goes until late, so we don't have to rush from work to get there in time!  We always get the godzilla tails (YUM) and the fried calamari appetizers, very good!  I'm planning on working my way through their sushi menu asap. The staff is always very attentive and friendly. Highly suggest!"}
{"text":"Went there to celebrate my birthday last week with my daughter and son.  There were several open seats at the bar which we requested that just needed wiping down.  Waited 45 minutes while watching the hostess with a headband do absolutely nothing.  4 servers kept scratching their heads, nobody able to clean the bar so we could be seated.  Watched 4 people seat themselves at the area and clean their own table.  I got up at least 6 times asking when we could be seated - never got seated.  Informed the clueless excuse of a hostess that she was an idiot and left without eating.  Thanks for the great birthday experience!  Whoever was the hostess on March 30th at 5:30 PM needs to be fired."}
{"text":"Decent, reasonable and average sushi.  Service was OK, nothing to go out of your way for.  Happy hour prices are pretty good but again, don't go across town just to go here.  However, if I'm in the neighborhood and craving some sushi, I'd go here again.  Wasn't crowded, but had a decent amount of people there.  Nice for a girls' night out and near the office.  As the rating says, \"A-OK\"."}
{"text":"After six months of eating sushi at different places around Phoenix, I just happened to stumble on this gem.  The hamachi and salmon were amazing!  The Dec 29 roll as well, almost like eating dessert.  I'm really surprised how reviewers have not picked up on this great little sushi bar inside a Japanese restaurant.  What is also amazing is that it is maybe 0.2 mi away from a terribly overpriced trendy sushi only place that I found had terrible service and sushi that was not nearly as good as Shogun!  Nice job!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to grab dinner! The happy hour menu is awesome. I love their apps, especially the godzilla tails. My roommate loves their steak appetizer. And I am a huge fan of their sushi. My favorites include the shogun roll and the surfer roll. I have never eaten any of the normal non-sushi entrees, but again, my non-fish eating roommate loves their teriyaki chicken bowl. The bar staff is very friendly and efficient. Plus, there is a large TV in the bar, so if there is a sporting event on you can watch. Great place!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Shogun for a little over 2 decades. The food has been consistent and prices are fair. The service can improve a bit. Lately however, I noticed 5% surcharge on the sushi and sashimi items if one were to order from a table as opposed to from the sushi bar.    The question is, whether or not if there is extra cost involved in bringing the food from the kitchen versus bringing the food from the sushi bar. I cannot find any rationale or justification.  I am wondering if Shogun is prepared to accept the consequences of losing $60 or higher in revenue due to their wishes of collecting 5% extra.  To be fair, the sushi and sashimi items that were ordered were fresh, well cut according to Japanese tradition, and tasted good."}
{"text":"I don't eat sushi but I enjoy the other items on the menu. I had the chicken Katsura and tempura. Everything was good, especially the cucumber salad you get before your entree. The service was decent. There were times that it took a while for our waitress to get back to us. It it was a Friday night and they were busy. We have been going there for years and we will go back again. Dinner for 2 was just under $40.00 with tip."}
{"text":"I have only been here once and it was on a weeknight so maybe it would be different if it was on a weekend, but I was not impressed. I feel like I have heard good things about this sushi bar, but the service was slow and felt the food was not the best. You know those crunchy noodle things that are on asian food? They were on my sushi rolls and seemed super weird.   I've been here once and not sure if I'll come back because I feel there are better and more delicious sushi restaurants out there. The more the sushi I eat, the more of a sushi snob I become...It was clean, but not the staff wasn't the most friendly. If a friend wanted to come here then I for sure would join, but I'd rather hit up a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night, waitress was nice . We  ordered miso soups and a couple of rolls. The miso soup was great but the rolls were terrible . I'm not sure if it was just that batch but the rice was slimy and fell apart as soon as it was moved. I wouldn't risk my $65 trying them again . Too bad I was really hoping for a better experience."}
{"text":"Large Japanese restaurant with very good decor, two rooms, sushi bar, lots of tables and booths.  Food ranged from excellent (nigiri) to mediocre (turkey salad).  Sushi is very pricey for lunch as there are no \"lunch combinations\" as other sushi bars. On line menu lists a sushi/roll combo for $15 but no longer available on printed menu.  The nigiri is made in very large portions (not bite size) so definitely worth the price. Turkey salad is all shredded cabbage with 4 tiny strips of cubed turkey breast that where very hard to find. Bento box and bowls are the best value along with one rotating lunch special, all in the $11 to 14 range.  Service was slow at noon Thursday when restaurant nearly empty; service improved by 12:45 when restaurant was half full.  Not sure why as there seemed to be plenty of servers and chefs.  Don't plan to return."}
{"text":"Dismal, abject, revolting.  These are words one would use to describe the contents of a garbage can, or a snuff film. You know nice, pleasant things that one would enjoy on a Sunday afternoon. Shogun however deserves none of this high praise. These words are a lofty goal by their standards.   I was so unfortunate to collide unwillingly with this place one Saturday for lunch and decided to order the unagi roll and the Panko Udon. I was expecting some common sense from the chef/wank they picked up off the street, but even hope fails occasionally in an explosion of misery. The unagi roll was horrible. The rice was not fully cooked, the contents were soggy and tasted old. The sushi would have been better if the chef had taken the ingredients, put them down his pants, sat on them for 5 minutes while riding a bull, and then vomited on the resulting creation. Later the Panko Udon arrived, and it was even worse. I understand that it was panko breaded and not a tempura batter, but still it was absolutely horrendous. They could not have overcooked the vegetables, shrimp, and fish more.  It was greasy, bland, insipid cooking that could not have been made better even if it were served with a diamond ring.  The store bought, cheap as you can find udon was undercooked and had the texture of noodles that had been sitting for about 30 minutes in a colander. These little beauties were served in a pool of horrific bottled tsuyu sauce that left a lingering chemical aftertaste that was just a delight to behold.  I would not eat here again even if my scrotum were stapled to a chair and I was chained to a table. I have to give this place one star too many because Yelp unfortunately has a one star minimum. I would even rate any fast food chain better than this place. I have had better airline food.  Cheers, Until then, get the beers in... Just not at Shogun."}
{"text":"We found ourselves at this corner, craving for a quick eat. We ducked in and were impressed by the sushi chef's quick service to sushi bar patrons and the hair hygiene of all waiters & sushi chefs. The one exception was the bartender.   The yellow tail & tuna hand rolls were loaded and very tasty; we'll return!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for at least a decade. While I've never tried the sushi, the main menu has been consistently excellent and the service consistent.   The food is fresh, presented as if the staff actually care, and the service is excellent. Our group is a bunch of talkers, so we typically arrive and spend at least 2-hours in our booth. Never has the staff acted impatiently, as we have experienced in other establishments.  A++"}
{"text":"Plates had food particles left on them and silverware had spots all over them.we resorted to swaping plates with empty seats and buffing them with our napkins.the floors are sticky my husband said the bathroom was horrible. The tea tasted almost sour and the soup tasted like chicken broth... and my soup spoon was dirty when she handed it to me in the soup. after the soup we had enough and payed for what we touched and left. We will never be back..."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Shogun for a looooooooooooong time. I remember when the restaurant was way smaller then it was, they knocked down a wall and made the restaurant bigger, which helped the wait time for their kick booty sushi.   Godzilla tails is a must as an appetizer, I don't know what they do, how they do it but they are amazing. ANY of their rolls are amazing. Try the Surfer roll!!!! Did ya hear me? TRY THE SURFER roll! Their turkey salad is also a must try but remember this, SHARE IT, it's HUGE! At least 3 people can share this salad. The wait time for your sushi is well worth it...trust me even though we just Yelped met.  Call the restaurant, they have a hidden special (maybe not hidden after this) - all you can eat sushi ONLY AT THE SUSHI BAR for $24.95, comes with other side dishes and dessert.  So, if you're in the area, stop by either for lunch or dinner, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Our family has frequented Shogun for years and we are done. The service is awful and the food has gone  downhill. While I hope that their manager Shelly has success turning it around, it is obvious that the owners don't care. Our friends are saying the same thing."}
{"text":"I've had both the sushi and the food here and I always leave feeling satisfied! The wait staff is very nice and go out of their way to make guests feel welcome. Servings are big, so keep this in mind. There are dishes and even sushi plates I felt the need to split with my party."}
{"text":"Best spicy tuna handroll in town, but I have many other favorite.  Sometimes the service is inconsistent, but overall it is my favorite sushi place to eat.  **Update** Place is under new ownership and quality has declined.  We no longer go once a week."}
{"text":"Came here with a big group, that had a reservation. But they didn't seem to be expecting us at all.  I was lucky and didn't have to wait long for my drink.  But some members of the group ended up waiting nearly an hour for a water.  They took the orders after we had been there for a bit, and that was fine. Then it went downhill.  We waited for the food for nearly an hour, and then when it came out it was all jumbled together (people from the far right side of the tables food was on a plate with people on the far left side of the table, and so they'd have to pass it all around).  Additionally, there were many orders that didn't come out with the main round, and had to be requested once the mess was sorted out, only to wait another while for that.  Finally we go to pay.  They \"couldn't split the bills\" because they had \"too many tables\"... fine, whatever.  So, we end up spending about 15 minutes sorting out the nonsensical check into pieces, with gratuity included already, so you cannot deviate from the standard percentage.   I had chicken terriyaki, which was fine.  It was a massive serving, but 90% rice, 10% chicken and sauce.   So good for that meal, made poor leftovers and was overpriced for what was received.  At least the drinks were cheap."}
{"text":"Great Sushi the best i have ever had. I have tried a lot of places in many different cities and this is the best. Everything from their regular roles of spicy tuna or yellow tail to their off menu's specialties like the nitro roll or OMG(OH MY GOD) roll. I live 45 minutes away and go here every week and can't get enough."}
{"text":"Beer and bar service was good. Tried a few things; Godzilla Tails were shavings of chicken soaked in Frank's Red Hot; oddly average for Asian cuisine. The Calamari was something artificial; looked like onion rings, but was some manufactured white sea meat that was far from any Calamari I've ever had. Awful, and they should call this something else, like Sea Rings. Cap it all off with a floor manager who decided to change a baseball game to a hockey game without asking who might be watching the game. Clearly an oversight, but when added to everything else, it gets one star for \"one and done\". Too many good places in this area to try this one again."}
{"text":"One of the better sushi places around. Always good food and the lunch specials are cheap. The shogun chicken is really good."}
{"text":"Great Sushi and Godzilla tails.  Everything we ordered was perfect and the service was impeccable. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"EXPENSIVE......This place used to be a regular visit when ever I came through Phoenix. I was shocked to see the high prices on my most recent and what will be my last visit. To put things into perspective, they are charging $35 for a Sashimi dinner. Matsuisa in LA , one of the highest rated sushi restaurants in the country, charges $36 and can justify that price. The sashimi I did try was cold and had not been properly thawed. If you are going to up the prices at least understand that sushi needs to be served at room temperature. Overall a frustrating experience. $9.50 for a basic spicy tuna roll.....I could go on and on about the new inflated prices.   Not sure if they are under new management , but they are certainly going in the wrong direction. The section devoted to sandwiches was also surprising and indicative of some confusion in the kitchen. I have never seen teriyaki fish sandwiches and don't understand why they would need an entire section of the menu. My friend ordered a roll that came to the table covered in Chinese crispy wonton noodles....not impressed or tasty.   During our meal we heard what I suppose was one of the owners discussing new ideas for the decor....I was tempted to ask what happened. My advice would be to leave a good thing alone....the prices are outrageous and unjustified. I am sure there are better places in the area and I will certainly be looking for them on my next visit. Stay away."}
{"text":"Shogun is the best we have eaten here for 30 years It is so good. We like to get the katsu chicken dinners."}
{"text":"On a recent trip home to visit my parents, we decided to visit Shogun since the Japanese restaurant in my hometown had closed. Shogun was one of the first Japanese restaurants to have opened in this area and was where we ate for my high school prom. I was highly disappointed when I looked on yelp and saw that Shogun was closed. Their website looked very up to date, so I decided to take the extra step and call the number. The woman who answered the phone seemed very shocked to hear that I thought they were closed and assured me they were very much open. Yay!  We arrived around 5:30 on a Friday night. There was one table already full, and we were seated at a second table that quickly filled up. By the time we finished dinner, all of the tables on the first floor were full and people were being seated in the upstairs section. Our party ordered different combinations of  filet, shrimp, and salmon. The filet was super tender, and the salmon had wonderful flavor. I did not try the shrimp. In addition to the meat, the meal consisted of soup, salad, rice, zucchini & onions, mushrooms, broccoli, cabbage, and sherbet. The chef was very good about asking each person if they wanted a component before putting it on a plate.  The flavors and quality of the food were much higher than a majority of the \"fast food\" and many of the sit-down Japanese restaurants I've been to. The best part was they had a coupon on their website for buy one meal, get one half off."}
{"text":"I'll start with praises for our chef. He was young but very talented. The food was good and he was very personable. The rest.... Small place with cramped seating. Horrible clogged disgusting mens bathroom. Understaffed. 15 minutes standing at the front desk before anyone took our name. Another 20 minutes to be seated. Then, over an hour wait at the table before the chef even started cooking. Felt forgotten while waiting.... No apologies or explanation for the abundant delays.   I won't go back but hope the chef finds a future elsewhere because this place is a dead end for his talents."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the food - not the sushi-  the shogun chicken with noodles and the shogun salad are the signature dishes and I LOVE THEM!  Consistently yummy for years. - nothing like it anywhere else.  Don't let the sushi haters scare you away from the regular menu - everything I've had has been great!  Ps never had a problem with service either."}
{"text":"Awful service.    We sat at the bar on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  Probably 10 people in the place.  We were there for a half an hour with our roll card filled out and the chef never even looked at it.  We walked out and never ate.  I don't care how good the food is, I will never go in there again."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch last weekend for the first time in over 8 years. I was happy to see that not much had changed, and the sushi was as delicious as ever! I was, however, disappointed in the available sushi lunch specials--I was so spoiled in NYC with all of the cheap sushi lunch spots everywhere!   The lunch menu here is seriously lacking in sushi, so I opted for a bento box which was huge (and cost about $13). I liked just about everything involved, and you get choices for each section of the box. You do get sushi with the bento box, but the selection is limited-either one roll (I got the spicy tuna, which actually had a lot more to it than just tuna-yum!) or two pieces of nigiri.   I also got teriyaki chicken, which was good but did not come with any rice...that was a bit unexpected, but because there's so much food in the bento box I didn't miss it. My friend ordered a side of it to go with hers and I don't think they charged us for it. For the \"salad\" option you can choose from sumunomo (probably butchered the spelling on that), turkey salad (sounds random but is actually really good), or seaweed salad (which I ordered). Seaweed was fresh and tasty, and the portion was definitely decent.  You can choose between shumai (shrimp dumplings), gyoza (pork dumplings) or something else that sounded calorie-bombish (I wanna say it was fried cheese? I didn't order it either way). My friend and I were steering clear of fried food so we got the shumai, which ended up being quite fried indeed! I haven't ever seen fried shumai, but I tried a small bite and it was decent but greasy.   I was glad that the small amount of sushi I had with lunch was as tasty and fresh as ever-I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"People complain about the time. I don't go out to rush myself while eating, if you want stupid delicious sushi, this is where to be. The surfer roll is unreal, and so is the OMG roll, but that's an off-menu roll. Lobster dynamite and green mussels are incredible as well."}
{"text":"waited for 30 minutes nearly, then the hostess proceeded to tell me it's going to be another 30 minutes. Also the genera manager is a bit rude, other than that the food is good."}
{"text":"always good no problems all the way around meals are large portions sushi is fresh.  I have been there approx ten times"}
{"text":"They charged us a 15% fee for take out. We didn't ask for delivery we picked it up ourselves. We always tip even on take out... Im not coming back for this reason. I like to go take out and the fee is silly."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my recent visit to Shogun.  Went around 9pm, ate at the bar.  Ordered a variety of sushi, enjoyed it all.  Highly recommend the Spicy Yellowtail Roll - Yum!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Shogun for years! It's always been a family favorite. Love the turkey salad combo with shogun chicken and the sushi is wonderful. Highly recommend for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Shogun Sushi Restaurant can be easy to miss, so ensure you do not miss out!  Shogun can be found in the strip mall area of Paradise Valley - right off Tatum and next door to Sprout's Supermarket.  It is here where you will find delicious, affordable sushi, as well as other Japanese items.  Note that Shogun is truly one of the original sushi bars in Phoenix.  Entering Shogun you will view the restaurant is divided into three distinct areas:  bar, sushi bar, and dining room.  You can select whichever you prefer and can order from the same menu at each of the three areas.  The hostess is there waiting and greeting you at the door, along with a sign of their daily specials.  To enter Shogun, is to enter a diverse world of Japanese specialties.   My absolute favorite is their Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura - six Jumbo shrimp and fresh vegetables - just the right amount of crunch and big in size.  You will not go away hungry when having their Tempura special.  Ordering any of their sushi is always fresh and delicious.  Particular favorites are their California Roll (for those looking to ease into the sushi experience), or their Caterpillar Roll for those more versed in their sushi.  If you are looking for other entrée options, their menu also boasts sandwiches, Donburi style of meal (selection of meats simmered and served over rice), or other entrees such as Teppan Chicken, or Samurai Steak.    Shogun Sushi Restaurant is a gem in the middle of the many delights Paradise Valley has to offer.  Be sure to stop by Shogun Sushi Restaurant today to take a walk off the beaten path of the regular dining establishments.  Area delivery to your home is also available!

{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go!  The food is amazing and so is the service.  We went with a group of 11 people tonight at the tepid table and everyone loved their food.  In addition, the management is great.  We loved having Ricardo cook our food...so funny and entertaining.  We highly recommend it.  My neighbors said that the sushi is amazing."}
{"text":"Have not made it to Shogun in a really long time. This time Monday right after the lunch rush and before they closed before dinner I was really surprised! The chef behind the counter Sergio totally recognized us right away it was comforting to know after going somewhere for 10 yrs falling on tough times and not being able to afford it for 2 yrs that you are still remembered. My tip is to sit at the sushi bar and no where else of course that's if there's an empty seat and you can. Each chef makes the rolls different I suggest you go with the OG chefs that know how to get it done."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi for many miles and miles around.  I've sampled many in the central phoenix area and have been so very pleased with Shogun.  If you are in the mood for great sushi, just give this place a try.  Sit at the sushi bar and order your favorites, or better yet, tell the sushi chef what your likes are and let him make an amazing roll or two for you.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We hadn't visited this restaurant in several years and decided to try it again.  Wow, has it gone downhill.  The service was terrible and slow. The waitress seemed very timid and afraid of the manager to the point that she couldn't even function.  Only one other table in the restaurant had any customers but still we waited 30 minutes for our meal to begin before giving up and leaving."}
{"text":"When I first started going to Shogun years ago, we always went there for the happy hour which offered inexpensive sake and Japanese beer.  The actual happy hour sushi was okay but that wasn't why were were there because there were not many choices for (real sushi rolls).  As time has gone by this place has really gone down hill.  I find that the place keeps the temperature to high for a Japanese restaurant and it makes it seem like they are too cheap to run the A/C cooler.  The last several times I've been there I no longer order the sake and Japanese beer so the sushi is simply not that good.  Also, their choice of music at night, old hair band rock and roll is played too loudly and interrupts the ambiance of what should be an intimate setting for people to enjoy their food.  Last time we were there about one hour before closing and they already placed all the bar stools on the tables and the lights were out  in some parts of the restaurant.  It made the place look uninviting and dark.  The annoying rock was playing loudly on the speakers as if they were just cleaning up for the night but people were still coming in.  Not a fan but I tag along with my friends who like to go."}
{"text":"I very, very rarely give anything below a 3 or 4 star review so I was a bit sad to do this but didn't have a choice. My boyfriend recently moved into the area and we are trying out some local places by the house and we were out shopping this past Saturday and decided to stop into Shogun for some sushi. We walked in and decided we would sit at the sushi bar since we wanted to be a little quick. We walked in and noticed about 3 people in the bar, 5 people at the sushi bar and 3 tables of people in the dinning area so it was not overly packed by any means. We proceeded to check in on yelp and wait, and wait and wait....I checked my yelp app to see when we checked in and it was 20 minutes before anyone came to take our drink order! The poor female server asked if the other male server had come over to us yet and we said no. It looked like he was only waiting on a family of 3 at the sushi bar and was overwhelmed. She clearly looked frustrated with him at this point I noticed. She took our drink order and we placed our sushi order on the bar and waited, and waited and waited again. I again checked to see how long we had been siting there since I had checked in and now we are going on 43 minutes and no food or the sushi chef hadn't even taken our sushi menu. We were going to give in another minute before just paying for our drinks and heading out to get something else. Well, right as we said that the sushi chef grabbed our selections. I had the Neon Roll and Sweet Shrimp, my boyfriend had the Las Vegas Roll and that was it. I received my Neon Roll about 10 minutes later and then shortly after my Sweet Shrimp and my boyfriend waited and waited for his roll. I finally asked where his roll was and it came out about 15 seconds later and it was cold. This roll should have been warm as it is deep fried with tempura batter. Once we were finished I took a look at my check in time and it was WELL over an hour! I think this is ridiculous for lunch for a restaurant that had less than 15 people in the entire place and us ordering 3 sushi items.   The food was very good but the service was horrible. I don't know if the quality of the food would override the poor service at this point. I know we will not be rushing back anytime soon and if we did we most likely would order take-out so we didn't have to deal with the bad service and EXTREMLEY long ticket times."}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst Japanese steakhouse I've ever been to. The soup was hot but had terrible flavor, salad was just iceberg lettuce with a pool of water at the bottom of the bowl, the only dressing besides ginger was shrimp sauce (wtf?), the chefs are mediocre at best, the prices were way too high for the quality of food. I used to be a butcher and they must be using some real cheap frozen chicken. Waitress only refilled my drink once the entire time. Portions were tiny. I thought I would give this place a try despite its negative reviews because it was the only Japanese steakhouse I could find in Gastonia. I think this entire town might just be garbage tho"}
{"text":"My 10 oz New York strip was 7 oz of fat. When I asked them to fit it, they declined. They also trying to charge more for the meal then advertised. They would not fix the order and they would not comp the small portion on our check. They then claimed we ordered things we had not. It smells like old cooking oil and it's seats make my back hurt. No longer a good place."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. We always get Godzilla Tails with a side of rice and a yellowtail roll. This is one of our go-to spots when we know exactly what we want. The sushi is good, the service is good, and the patio is wonderful when it isn't crowded. Happy hour is every day from 7-close in the bar, which is less like \"happy hour\" and more like...lower priced food in the bar."}
{"text":"Get the turkey salad with extra turkey yum, go on on monday night for 25 cent Blue Moons!"}
{"text":"It was just okay. Used to come here all the time for sushi until I discovered Ra & Sushi Brokers. Was feeling nostalgic and decided to come back. It was pretty dull; The atmosphere, the food and the service."}
{"text":"This was one of the best times had in a restaurant in awhile.  Took my mother there for her birthday, they were friendly taking the reservation, the seating reserved was perfect for the view of the chefing done.  They treated my elderly mother with courtesy and friendliness.  She'd never seen a \"show\" like that before and enjoyed herself muchly!  The chef himself was playful and fun and good at what he does.  The prices were very reasonable and we left with ALL of us tipping very well!   A bit more seasoning in some of the dishes would have been nice, but it was delicious just the same!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for AYCE. The menu was limited and what we did tried we didn't like. Better off spending a few extra bucks down the street at Tatemono or today sushi if you're looking for decent sushi"}
{"text":"That was just disappointing and strange.   Sweet server, lame host, TERRIBLE sushi. Didn't try the food but if you want SUSHI go elsewhere.  Cooked fish inside a sushi roll???"}
{"text":"Shogun.  Not my go-to place for sushi.  The one thing this place has going for it, it's quiet.  The fish quality is good, not A+++ super fresh, but I'll take that over the swarms of college students chanting \"Sake Bomb, Sake Bomb\".  Its a nice change of pace if you want to go out to sushi with friends, have a mellow quiet dinner and go home.  The rolls are generous, they have a lot of them, so read the menu carefully.  The sashimi is good although a bit uninspired.  The presentation is not as pretty as other restaurants, but it does tend to be a dollar cheaper or so for menu items.  Good selection of beer to boot."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great atmosphere, and an overall good time. We came in for some sushi and drinks and we were not disappointed. Food was delicious, drinks reasonably priced, and the service was awesome. Our bartender, Rob, was attentive, not to mention funny. He was on top of everything so we were never left waiting. Great time and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place and we share this with friends for special occasions such as the night we recently went here.  The only problem we had was ordering our drinks and the only drink not the same we ordered did not come until we asked for it again after we ordered our food.  The server did not write anything down and probably the reason we did not get the drink, either way this picture shows the table at the time of check being dropped.  Where on this table can you sign a check?"}
{"text":"Hostesses were very nice and welcoming when we walked in for dinner, and so were the other servers. However, the server we got gave off a little bit of a bad attitude vibe.   My friend and I ordered 3 rolls, and one of them was a Las Vegas roll which I had ordered. We received our first 2 rolls and I thought maybe she was going to bring out the Las Vegas next. She didn't, and once we had finished the 2 rolls of sushi, I asked the server if the Las Vegas roll was going to be out soon (thinking maybe she forgot). Sounding annoyed, she said, \"It's not even done yet! It like takes awhile to prepare.\" Okay, chill out; it was a simple question and there was no need to \"like\" seem so annoyed by it.   Other than that one small incident, the sushi was decent, nothing too special but it was good."}
{"text":"Sushi for me is an acquired taste, one that I am still acquiring as a matter of fact. So it's pretty profound that I really enjoyed my meal here. I wasn't thrilled with the Las Vegas Roll but the Soft Shell Crab and especially the Spicy Yellowtail rolls were amazing.  Throw in some sake bombers and a good time was had by all."}
{"text":"Love me some Shogun!! I first went here with my cousins, and we had a bunch of different rolls. I can't remember the exact names (Sake anyone??) but it was some of the best sushi I have eaten. I hear their chicken katsu is awesome too, but I have only tried the sushi. It's delicious and reasonable."}
{"text":"Came in to pick up some sushi togo and the place was packed. Was greeted by the owner and she was awesome. I found out she bought the place a couple of years ago.  Shogun was the first sushi I ever tried back in 1999 when I moved to Arizona from Kansas. The sunshine roll is out of this world and I can never go without ordering the Godzilla tails. Twenty five cent beers on Monday and great deals if you sign up to get their emails. This trip I got $5 off my order of $20 or more.   I have tried a lot of sushi and even eaten tuna right off the boat on a couple of 10 day fishing trips in the Pacific I have taken, and Shogun is still my favorite.  If it's been awhile since you have been to one of the original sushi joints in Phoenix give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is AWFUL. Go try it if you have money to throw away and want to have a good laugh."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Sushi spot in the Scottsdale area! The staff is not overly friendly, but the fish is Outstanding! It is fresh and tasty. They know how to cut the fish, which does affect the taste. The Surfer roll is very tasty if you like cooked seafood on top of a roll. The Sunshine roll is my favorite and has a generous portion of fresh tuna on top of the roll and the spicy Japanese mayo is the Star of the roll!!"}
{"text":"If you're a picky sushi eater, don't waste your time here... it may be cheap, but the service and quality reflect that.  Somehow, I managed to spend about $25 on my dinner there tonight, even with happy hour pricing.  I know, it's not so bad for sushi... but the service was extremely off, and the sushi was just meh.  I'd been before and I'm sure I'll go again, just with the expectations in check next time.  I shared an order of yellowtail sashimi, an I also had a seaweed salad (it was violet in color - have you ever seen that before?), a scallop handroll (generous in serving size but way too creamy for my liking), and an order of ikura.    We sat in the bar area... it was fine for a casual dinner with friends, but nothing fancy at all.  There are much better sushi places to choose from - even in AZ!"}
{"text":"We were not told it had no hibachi grill until we arrived for dinner even though it was advertised as such."}
{"text":"I have been a fan at this local neighborhood spot that is quietly tucked in a corner of the sprouts shopping center. Basically can dine lunch or dinner any day of the week and guarantee delicious fresh food and pleasant customer service. I myself like sitting in the bar area which is actually half the size of the restaurant! Full size bar with large screen tv. Today I went with the lunch special of a chicken teriyaki bowl and 8 lobster rolls. Delicious and plentiful food at a reasonable price ."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Japanese restaurant! Never had a bad time here. Great food and the showmanship while it's being prepared is great as well. Very friendly service and generous portions."}
{"text":"If you like long waits, over priced sushi then this is the place to go. Their menu was laking a lot of basic Sushi. Big disappointment as I was a Sushi Fien that night but not enough to eat the sushi they brought. Also, my friend (Ms. adventurous) ordered Chicken Teriyaki... now we know that is a pretty simple dish. Not for them! A  huge bowl of white rice with a minimal amount of cold chicken and I'm not sure what kind of sauce that was but it wasn't teriyaki. Although most meals come with tea, you have to ask for it. They won't offer it. There was another item that you had to request as well. I say BooOOOooooOOOOOOooo!!!  The only thing that might be worth it is the Sake. I didn't have any but a lot of the patrons had Sake on their tables and they all seemed to be on a good one.."}
{"text":"Shogun is one of my favorite spots to grab a few rolls.  It is the only place in the valley that I have found that serves Wahoo (otherwise known as Ono).  The spicy Wahoo roll, the Wahoo sashimi and the Sunset roll are two of my absolute favorites.  I have been stopping by for years and it is consistently good.  I have a lot of friends that are fans of the Godzilla tails too.  Oh, the tempura onion rings are the best onion rings I have ever had!  I will continue visiting this favorite little spot."}
{"text":"The sushi was decent, the mussels were chewy, the sashemi rocked.  The down side-we had to wait over 30 minutes for the food and they had a 5% sushi tax."}
{"text":"Love this place. The sushi is always fresh and delicious, as is the vegetable tempura. Our favorite place to get sushi!"}
{"text":"Get the Chicken Katsu platter. Omg the Katsu sauce, and the portions in general are better than anywhere else I have been.  Sunomono Salad done right. Fresh tea. We love to nibble on either the veggie tempura or \"Godzilla Tails\" before our meal. Crunchy Roll is my brothers favorite"}
{"text":"The absence of flaw in beauty is itself a flaw.  I was in Phoenix for 17 hours a couple of days ago.    It was a perfectly warm day outside, one of those beautiful early fall days in the desert when the sun bathes everything in clear, comforting sunlight.  It felt great just walking around Kierland Commons in the warm, late afternoon sunshine.   My friend chose her favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix, Shogun, for dinner.  We got there fairly early and sat at the sushi bar.  Looking around, I noticed that I was the only Buddhahead in the restaurant (and I'm only half-Asian).  \"This can't be a good sign\", I thought.  Don't' get me wrong:  I don't believe that a restaurant operator's ethnicity must match the culinary heritage of the food he serves.  This can't be right.  Food, like human compassion and friendship, transcends race and ethnicity.    My friend ordered most of the items off the menu.  We started with a Sunshine Roll, which was heaping mounds of spicy tuna loaded onto a modified California Roll.  The sauce for the spicy tuna was heavily mayonnaise based, which was a bit odd.  It was different, but tasty and original.  The Wahoo Sashimi in ponzu sauce with sliced cucumbers was light and delicate.  Wahoo is ono in Hawaii and is a white fish that is mild and slightly sweet.  It went well with the citrus ponzu.    The Veggie Roll was odd in that the ingredients didn't blend together at all.  It consisted of cooked asparagus, some kind of weird takuan (pickled daikon radish) that was a bit bitter, kimpira gobou (burdock root), and shisou (mint leaf).  All the wasabi and gari in the world couldn't fix this roll.   We also had Shake Sushi (Salmon Sushi), Octopus Salad, and some edamame.  The sushi here was so far off the beaten path that the tastes were a bit off, they were almost uncomfortable to my palate.  But, it's good to try different styles of food in different settings.  Food doesn't have to be perfect, or authentic, to be enjoyable."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch. Yes the staff can be uneven. Overall the food is great  Katsura chicken , great Shogun chicken , delicious  Turkey Salad, yummy  You could easily live very happily on just these three dishes"}
{"text":"The food was average. We had the chicken katsu, California roll and ebi roll. The katsu chicken was the best thing we ordered. It was American Japanese food not authentic. The server was nice but the manager was obnoxious walking through the restaurant speaking loudly about women. He was arguing with a female customer as we walked in. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I think it is pretty darn good.   Love the tempura and love the sushi! But the apple dessert is to die for!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Maybe it was like one of the reviewers mentioned that it depends on the day that determines how the kitchen is.  At first the pricing seemed high but after we received our food, we realized it was quite a bit of food for the price, so that wasn't bad.   The server was nice, but the food came out really slow.  I would say we were there for at least 30 mins before the food came out.  The restaurant had a few tables but with the staff, there shouldn't be any reason why the food would come late. It was not tasty at all.  My Ginger Chicken (can't remember the name of the dish but essentially that is what it was, Ginger Chicken) barely had any flavor, my mom's Beef Udon dish was very salty.  My dad's Unagi had a couple of pieces (not big pieces) but a huge bowl of rice, same as my daughter's shrimp dish."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst service I've ever experienced in my life. The food itself was good but wow I've never been more disappointed. Our waiter (mel) made it seem like we were bothering her by eating there. My girlfriend asked a question about the udon noodles and her response was \"their noodles how else would you like me to explain them\". Body language was awful the entire time. Didn't check on us once. Once we finished our food we had to wait 30+ minutes for the check after asking for it. If you want to build a business and want people to come back you should probably hire people that at least can act like they want you there and at least try to have good customer service. Won't be back and wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Our first night at Shogun tonight. The food was really good and our waitress was very helpful. The hostess, Chloe was so friendly and helped explain the way the restaurant worked-so personable!! Our first sushi experience  was great! It was .25 saki tonight even!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Been going here for more than 20 years and have found it to be consistently reliable. Whether at the sushi bar or at a table we've never left disappointed. I miss the candy sushi though."}
{"text":"Pros- lots of sushi variety for rolls big portions even with sake  Cons- food tasted meh I didn't like the shogun roll special appetizer-sauce was good texture was chewy expensive  service was not very good they barely speak english and wouldn't split our checks"}
{"text":"I love this place one of my favorites to go for lunch and to take folks from out of town.  They have freshest seafood every time.  Serjo is the best, down to earth sushi chief.  Love love him and his famous Big Johnson roll."}
{"text":"this is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Gastonia, it's a bit on the pricey side but it is worth it. the portion sizes are huge and the chefs are very friendly and have a great sense of humor. the food is very very good! I come here whenever I can."}
{"text":"Love this place and their sashimi! Tuna sashimi, rice, edamame and I'm one happy camper. Sean was my server today and he was awesome. I'll always keep coming back."}
{"text":"Went about a year ago with a girlfriend and had the best roll of all my 27 years, okay... That's untrue, I've  been eating sushi for 2. Anyway, back to the roll. The chimichanga was flavorful and fresh with just the right amount of fish & rice. Perfection. I returned with my husband last week for a couple rolls on happy hour.. Way wah waaahh. No such luck! There was only a California and some other lackluster option, so we booked it down to Sushi Brokers & had a feast for $40."}
{"text":"Strange, this place charges 15% on takeout orders for a tip for the sushi chef!! Not sure I like that when their prices are high to begin with!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was very good and fresh. The restaurant was very busy, probably due to the $0.25 draft beers on Monday night's. The sushi counter was kinda awkard with high panels."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for about 20 years, and I am happy to say, I have a great experience every time, after all these years they are still the best!! I continue to have great dining experiences and always look forward to returning. The atmosphere is cozy, and the sushi is outstanding!! Crunchy Roll is by far the favorite, it's always the first thing I order. But, we are branching out a bit, and my wife ordered the Shogun Roll because she loves lemon, and I thought... it didn't sound that great, but I encouraged her to try it, well, to my surprise, it's Very interesting, very good! My step daughter ordered the Surfer Roll, that was very good too, but the Crunchy Roll is still King! Oh, and don't forget to order the Yakumi Apples for desert, they are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.   Went in to get take out and waited for 15 minutes to place an order. Just wanted a rice, veggie and chicken bowl to go. I ordered it and the waitress said $18. I paused and almost said for chicken and rice. That is the cheapest food possible. Waited another 10 minutes for my food. When I got it I took it home and went to open it. It was all rice and veggies with barely any chicken. So I paid $18 for rice and carrots and other veggies. Food was decent but not worth the $18 maybe $8-$10. Will not be going back there. Be aware of this place as they over charge you for everything."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 15 years on a very regular basis. Consistent good, appropriately priced sushi. The 'regulars' order off the menu without issue but also know to ask for the 'secret sushi menu' which is comprised of some rolls that the sushi chefs made for regular customers. For a laugh, get the Big Johnson. The Surfer roll is the best roll on the menu. Eel is great! Salad dressing is nice. I don't care for the Turkey salad which is slivers of turkey cold cut combined with shredded cabbage in a very boring salad dressing. Too bland!  Yes .25 beer on Monday is excellent seeing as they have imported beer on two for that price: Kirin Ichiban, Sapporo, and domestic s. Happy hour menu is limited but dirt cheap."}
{"text":"best sushi in Phoenix. Funkadellic roll is my favorite dessert. Also like chimichanga roll, big jack and pajama roll."}
{"text":"Still giving them a 4 for the food. It is ALWAYS amazing. However the service is at a TWO :(  the service is getting worse and worse by the visit :(  A few weeks ago me and a few girlfriends went on a Friday night. Yes they were super busy but our waiter may have been the worst waiter I have ever encountered anywhere. Ever.   Drinks were messed up. Drinks would take a solid 20 minutes to com if they came at all. Everybody's food came out great but when the bill came he had billed us for a few extra things. At one point he was not comprehending that 2 + 1 = 3 and not FOUR. Good grief!   We had the manager at our table several times. He did take care of us and made things right. But dang.   I reallllly hope they get their act together. I love eating here but really can not take one more bad service from them."}
{"text":"This place is DIRTY.   This wouldn't have been my choice for lunch because I had actually read the reviews prior. However, I was invited to lunch here by my coworkers and I didn't want to be rude.   It's located in a strip mall parking lot. The exterior could use some sprucing up. Upon entering at 12:30 pm on a Tuesday the place was EMPTY and remained empty our entire visit.   There's dirt and grime around the front door, inside the lobby, even the chairs were sticky. I grabbed my chair to reposition it and the top part was so disgustingly sticky. I thought about leaving but again I was with a group of coworkers and I didn't want to be rude because they had all said that they loved the place and had eaten there many times before. So I just prayed that God would make my stomach strong and that I wouldn't get food poisoning.  We were promptly greeted by a very nice lady who took our orders. And then we sat around waiting for the chef to come out. He was very entertaining polite and friendly (kept calling himself Jackie Chan). The food was decent - nothing to write home about. The portions seemed to be a bit smaller than what you would get at other Hibachi type restaurants.   I inspected my fork while I was waiting for the chef and it wasn't as clean as I would have preferred. I used my hand sanitizer to clean it.   I'm writing this review about 4 hours from the time that I ate here & so far I'm doing good. No feelings of nausea, no vomiting, no stomach pains but I definitely will not eat here again the place is just too dirty and run down."}
{"text":"Some friends and I were meeting up for sushi and this place was one of the closest sushi places to their house so we decided to stop by.  It was fairly busy when we showed up but we were seated right away which was nice.  Half of our party (the guys) were going to be showing up a little later but we went ahead and ordered some drinks and appetizers to tide us over until they showed up.  The waitress was nice if somewhat lacking in her knowledge of the menu but we didn't really mind.  After getting our appetizers and initial drinks we really didn't see our waitress, well actually let me rephrase that, we saw her at other tables around us just not at ours.  Now, I understand that we had told her we were going to wait to order until our party shows up so it's not like we expected her to show up and take our whole order, but she wasn't even coming around to fill our water glasses or to check and see if we needed refills.  Once the guys showed up and we ordered the food came out and I was kind of underwhelmed.  None of it was bad but it was all pretty average.  The only thing memorable were the Panko Breaded Onion Rings which were fantastic.  Honestly I would go just for those babies.  As for the sushi I may try a different roll and see if that made a difference and I would definitely hope for a server who's a little more attentive."}
{"text":"Food is a solid 3.  Service is all over the place...sometimes awesome...occasionally slow.  Management is the only reason I didn't rate a 3.   Have seen too much un customer friendly behavior on that end.   If in the area, Yasu has amazing, albeit more expensive food.    Sakana on Indian Bend is the same price point as Shogun but has outstanding sushi and great service if you are up for a 15 minute drive."}
{"text":"so i went here for lunch with my boyfriend. the restaurant is a fairly good size and we were there around 1145. it was so slow, maybe 15 people in the whole place. we ordered 2 rolls and 45 minutes later still no rolls. i stopped the server asked him what had happened to our food and he said \"its out of my hands\" i ask for a manager, he goes to the back to get her she goes to the sushi bar and this other lady comes over to us. she said well what do you want to do? get your food and go or just go? she was incredibly rude but we ended up getting the rolls about 15 minutes later and she says \"hey thanks guys\". WHAT?! She was the WORST manager i have ever seen deal with a bad situation, had no realization at all for customer service, none. i know we will never ever go back here again! oh yeah and when we went to eat the food, the order was wrong! ridiculous. worst sushi place, ever!"}
{"text":"After spending the afternoon cleaning and redecorating my grandson's room, we went to Shogun to celebrate his birthday. If you have ever cleaned a 16 yr old boy's room you can understand why I was exhausted and starving. While I do eat Sushi, playing around with fussy little pieces of raw fish turned into artwork isn't really my thing, so I ordered the Teppan Chicken. I was hungry but this enormous plate arrived with 2 chicken breasts on a bed of grilled noodles, salad, a raw carrot/radish slaw and a bowl of rice (after I had eaten the miso soup and cucumber salad). The chicken was perfectly cooked, very moist and infused with flavor from the sliced ginger on top. The grilled noodles were okay. I prefer them soft and squishy. The rice was perfect. As hungry as I was, I could only get through half of one of the chicken breasts. My husband is the sushi lover and he enjoyed the sushi and rolls that he selected. In fact, our whole group was happy with their choices and there was a lot of leftovers for the next day's lunches. The only complaint came from the kids who got plain seltzer instead of their Sprites. Service was good. We will continue to come back."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some sushi and hadn't been here in a long time, but remembered good things, so we popped in for some happy hour sushi and drinks on Friday. Lo and behold, their happy hour isn't on Fridays or Saturdays. Well, no big deal. We still sat in the bar area and chose some sushi. Our waitress was fairly attentive and happily agreed to have the sushi chef pick a roll for us in addition to the godzilla tail app, Alaskan roll, December 29th roll, and spicy tuna roll.   The godzilla tails were pretty good. Seemed thinner than I remember, but okay. The chef made us a roll that wasn't on the menu yet, which he called the Grease Lightening. It was surprisingly tasty and very light, which is lucky because the rest of our sushi was terrible. The Dec 29th roll was bland and very dry. I had to drench each piece in the eel sauce. The spicy tuna roll came out as a spicy yellowtail roll, but we didn't much care since I'm a big fan of yellowtail, however it wasn't spicy in the least-- and believe me, I have a low spice tolerance. Worst of all, the salmon in the Alaskan roll looked and tasted as if it had come out of a can. I could not believe how terrible it was. What a waste of fifty bucks."}
{"text":"If you love SALT, this is the place to go. I ordered the hibachi chicken with an egg roll to go. I saw the chef come out and grill it up...great it should be fresh. Took a step out and came back in and it looked great. When I get home and take my first bite it was if I drank from the Atlantic. It was extremely salty and very little flavor. I couldn't even finish. I drank a gallon of water for the rest of the day. Haven't been back since."}
{"text":"I went here with a couple of friends and my brother and we were not disappointed. My brother isn't one for eating sushi, but he ended up loving it. It's a little pricey,  but most sushi is to begin with. Will most likely go back!"}
{"text":"I will not be going back to shogun again. I came here a year ago and had a sub par experience- just no fresh fish. I took a friend back yesterday thinking I had a one off experience. We both got sick.  The octopus sashimi was slimy, and the yellowtail was mushy and kinda oily-  then the salmon was super dry..... all in all there are so many great sushi places around here- I will not be going back to shogun again......"}
{"text":"Good location, and it is on the fancier side of a sushi restaurant, it's not just a whole-in-the-wall sushi place. The host was awesome and super fun to talk to, our server you could tell wanted to be somewhere else but still tried her best to be somewhat kinda happy. That didn't stop us from enjoying ourselves though. The sushi were made by Latino men, so it's not like your authentic Japanese sushi. The rolls were however very very good, the caterpillar and the shogun rolls were amazing!! Definitely get those when you go, overall very good, for a dinner date and if you're an avid sushi freak like me and my husband, you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Normally I love coming here, but tonight was honestly a terrible experience. I called in at 5:10pm and ordered 3 items (1 sushi roll, 1 salmon bowl, 1 squid salad). I arrived around 5:40pm, picked up my order and went home. Once home, I realize I got the wrong roll. I called and they were pretty apologetic, and asked if I wanted to come back for the right roll. So I make my way back, by the time I get there it's 6:30pm. I wait a few minutes and they give me my roll. I'm walking out the door and I realize they gave me another wrong roll  I go back in and again they are bey apologetic, and tell me they'll get me the right roll. 6:50pm and I finally get my roll I ordered at 5:10pm. I gave 2 stars because the girl at the front was very kind and apologized many times for the error. Just irritated that it took me 2 hours to get dinner :/ hopefully it tastes good..."}
{"text":"The beer Monday night is only $0.25!! That deserves four stars right there!! Sushi is decent too!! The TV's are a little small and could be upgraded for Monday Night Football.  All around $0.25 beers is a home run every time!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in phoenix, my favorite place to go for lunch enormous food portions and great prices. they have a dinner for 2  for $34.99  it came with an appetizer, 2 entrees, and dessert. all the staff were friendly and professional. Nice place to take a hot date."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love this place. We went on a late dinner date and were super impressed. Our hopes were set very high since we came by way of referral and our expectations were exceeded! Our favorite was the Big Johnson. My referral told me to ask for it X-Rated, so we did... and oh what a joy it was... Mmmmm. We lucked up and it was happy hour. Ichi ni san!!"}
{"text":"I am appalled. It takes quite a bit to get me to write a bad review. The wait staff is horrid. I can't believe this place has a 97.5 health rating. The state should revisit them. The vent systems are not adequate for this. If a restaurant can't vent the grease, at least clean your walls! We're  not talking about a huge place either. Half the restaurant is unused bar space.  Be advised that you ARE charged gratuity for parties of 6 or more. This is not a line item on your receipt. Clever huh?  The only reason this place didn't get one star was the chef was nice and the portions were even larger then typical Japanese restaurants. I found their ginger salad dressing a train wreck. The onion soup tasted like dirty dish water. Clear cutting of corners even though they charge pricing in line with any other Japanese restaurant. I would hate to take a walk through their walk-ins."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the sushi is good quality for a fair price. This Friday night, I was there with my family and we had a good time with great service and food. We always tend to sit in the bar for happy hour and this time Annalise was serving us. She did a great job on waiting on us and kept checking on us to make sure everything was tasting good. As many times as we've been here we've never had someone with this great of an attitude and she always kept a smile. Glad to see the service is improving. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Got 4 orders of teriyaki chicken to go. They packaged them in containers that leaked all over--all 4. Plus, the amount of chicken they give you for $15 is pitiful. I used to really like this place but obviously things have changed. Doubtful I'll be back, go to PF Changs down the street."}
{"text":"Been to Shogun numerous times over the years and it is what it is....authentic Japanese cuisine cooked by authentic Mexicans  (no disrespect intended for either race!)  The two brothers that have been making sushi there since it opened are very good at what they do.  Their rolls are inventive and generous.  It's not the best, but you can't beat the price either.  They serve crab with a \"K\" and that is ok with me.  If you order a soft shell crab handroll you will know what I mean..a humungous roll made with creamy krabmeat, but for 8 bucks, I am good with that.  The menu is sure to please most people, katsu, tempura etc...that is usually what I go for at Shogun, with a smattering of sushi rolls....it is what it is....a great value for Japanese food."}
{"text":"Low quality sushi. Not the finest sushi ingredients. Sushi rolls drenched in sauce to hide the ingredients. Even the sauce seems watered down. I gave it 2 stars because of the service. The staff was great. Wouldn't recommend anyone eating here."}
{"text":"If I could give 3 & 1/2 I would.   We are new to this restaurant and have tried it twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.  Like the other reviews the experience has been a little mixed.  The food is very good, the prices are very reasonable.  We have come across the blond kid, who I don't think is a stoner, he's just on \"the spectrum\" and really should not be the first person you meet coming into a restaurant.  He'll help you or answer questions, but you will have to work harder than you would expect talking to a server, and you might feel a little offended by his emotionally stunted responses.  Last night we went for dinner and had a great time, but had a front desk person, who got annoyed when we asked to sit at another table that wasn't right next to the kitchen.  But once seated, the food was excellent and came pretty quickly.  The new server we got was funny and very friendly, we gave her a good tip.  I feel the place has good potential, but the management needs to do a little more to get good people who want and like to be there, and teach them some consistency in what level of service their customers expect."}
{"text":"2nd Chance Update.........The food has always been great here.... but tonight the service was also wonderful. Enjoyed our experience and food....... GREAT!!! Thanks so much"}
{"text":"This is a sushi bar whose 'house specialty' is turkey salad.  Need we say more?"}
{"text":"An okay place for Japanese food and sushi.   We were looking for something near our hotel and came across Shogun. The service was pleasant and attentive. The food was decent, but nothing outstanding.  Everyone had a different dinner combination and sushi. The Surfer Roll wasn't too bad. You definitely do get a lot of food. Between the dinners and a few roll orders the table was covered in plates."}
{"text":"Not impressed and probably won't be back. I came for lunch and was immediately turned off by the lighting and décor. I sat down and began to peruse the menu when I saw \"Ask server for bento box selection\". I asked the server and he looked at me as though I had grown a third eye. He told me they didn't have bento boxes.. I showed him the menu to which he said \"hmff that's weird\".   None of the lunch items on the menu struck my fancy so I ordered the lunch special. I got the chicken katsu, it was over fried, hard and dry. The accompanying mammas roll had an overwhelming mayo flavor. And guess what? It came in a bento box.   There are a ton of great sushi spots in this area so Shogun really needs to step it up to be in line with their competition. (Thank God for Yasu's!)"}
{"text":"The ONLY place I will eat sushi in this whole city. Have Andy make your rolls if he is behind the counter! OMG, inferno, and surfer roll are top notch."}
{"text":"Over the years this place has been our main-stay.  We go for one thing, the Surfer Roll.   It is the best roll we have ever had, or ever found anywhere.  The place is just solid.  Good price, good service and a lot of fun.   Take our tip... forget sitting in the dining room.  Sit at the bar, take the recommendations of whoever is working behind the counter, and order at least one Surfer.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was so surprised - I don't eat Japense food regularly but my brother suggested it and I'm so glad he did!!! It was AMAZING!!! From the service to the fantastic food it was hands down one of the best lunches I've had in a while. The portions were huge!!! Such a great value!! Also the complimentary green tea with my entree was SO GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 15 years and this is THE best sushi spot in town! I have been to tons of sushi places all around the valley and this is by far the best place to go! Many of the others are over-rated and you pay more for the ambiance not the food and the service.  I have to give a big shout-out to Sergio!  He is awesome! Shogun serves fresh sushi every time, you get large portions, a great menu selection and an amazing staff!  You can log into their free WiFi while you are there and earn discounts via emailed coupons too! Thank you Shogun for your many many years of continued service!"}
{"text":"Me and my son have been coming here for about 4 years. It is literally one of the best sushi places in the valley. We usually come either Sunday's or Saturdays mostly Sunday's but the sushi chef Andy is super nice. He makes us our own sushi rolls. This is a amazing sushi place and refer it to everyone. It deserves more then 5 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and was very happily surprised at my dining experience.  The hostess was friendly, waiter funny and attentive, and other staff said goodbye to us as we left.  Had to have edamame to start of course, and for the first time ever at a Japanese restaurant, they were steaming hot and not over salted.  I had the salmon roll and a shrimp tempura roll. Tasty and fresh.  ---sorry but I'm not a fan of shashimi, so I stick to rolls.  Had another dish called \"Dragon Tails\" which was chicken stir fried in  a spicy, almost buffalo style hot sauce. Huge portion.  When I peaked at the other diners across the room every portion looked really big! I mean at least two if not three portions per serving.  Our entree was out a few minutes earlier than the sushi, the waiter came by a few times and kept us updated, but it seemed as if he knew the sushi would come out later so why not wait 5 min then turn out order in to the kitchen?  Nice yummy, hassle free lunch.  Thank you Shogun."}
{"text":"I forgot about this spot until my wife and I were around the PV mall area. I see they expanded the restaurant, not too sure when that was done because it's been quit a few years since I've been here.   We were seated right away, despite how busy the restaurant was. The place was packed out which is always a good sign.  We started with some miso soup, flavorful, love how much tofu is actually added to the soup. I also ordered the sunomono salad which is also very good and flavorful. My wife insisted we ordered the godzilla tails, glad I listened! The Godzilla tails are white meat chicken strips lightly fried and sautéed in their house special hot sauce and topped with green onion. This appetizer is freaking amazing.  On to the sushi.  We ordered the Surfer Roll which is a spicy tuna roll which is topped off with cooked sauteed shrimp in a creamy sauce. Thumbs up all the way! We got the mama's roll too, their crab salad inside the roll is so good.  Rolls take time to come out but it's so worth the wait. Fresh ingredients, awesome staff. I'll for sure come back, after all, any restaurant that has been around for over 20+ years has to be good for a reason."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for the one sushi chef to make our small order. Not a good situation   We were told it would take a half hour. No one should have to wait that long after being seated. The restaurant needs to be more honest about wait times.  Beware!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting from Southern CA and had a hankering for sushi. If you appreciate fine sushi, DO NOT eat here. The restaurant is somewhat dingy, and the sushi chefs are not overly responsive. We ordered a rainbow roll that was halfway decent, but the crunchy roll was horrible and had dried noodles on top. This place deserves a pass ."}
{"text":"This place has the best yellowtail sushi that I've ever had. I   They usually put jalapeño slices on top. Their master sushi chefs know how to make any request that I have. Even the difficult combinations. I have been going here for years and always see the same chefs every time."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed the most recent of many many meals at Shogun...have been coming here for over 30 years, And, I'm pleased FOR ONCE to say that nothing has changed...thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Cool atmosphere. Godzilla tails were delicious! Dinner for 2 was a great deal and had huge portions of our entrees. Didn't have any drinks but looked like they had some decent deals. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"As soon as I pull into the parking lot I want to sprint into the building and jot down my order as fast as possible. I know exactly what I want. A Surfer Roll. It's my favorite thing on their menu and the moment it hits my table I'm like a ninja with my chop sticks ready to eat. They do have a variety of other rolls, and I enjoy quite a few of them, but nothing compares to the Surfer Roll.  The service can be hit or miss and some of the prices are a smidge high, but overall definitely worth 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Absolutely NO atmosphere. In fact the interior is so badly in desperate need of an interior design makeover, I almost hate going there. Their Sunshine roll is pretty good, however their crunch roll was pretty awful.... (topped with canned chow mein noodles??- gross!! ) Even my husband wouldn't eat it!  Service isnt too bad and most times we have been seated quickly."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place for sushi. Didn't mind paying a little more here.  I've been a regular here for over 15 years.  But the last few times have been sub par.  I think the place needs some tlc, maybe some new booths.  But worst of all the quality of the sushi has gone south.  Hope they can turn it around."}
{"text":"Came by here with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday.  Unfortunately, the service here is just lacking in most areas.  After we placed our food order, it was probably around 45 minutes before we received it.  When it came out, there was general confusion concerning what was being served, and who ordered what.  We spent five minutes trying to determine what kind of sushi order was being served - no one seemed to know.  In addition, after we ordered all of our food, we were told that they could not do any separate checks, which was pretty frustrating.  We ended up doing about 15 minutes worth of math ourselves to split up the tax and food orders on our bill so they could then take our figures and charge each card accordingly.  Normally, I wouldn't get too twisted up about this, but after waiting three quarters of an hour for food, I was not in the best of moods.  The food itself was actually pretty good, albeit a bit pricey.  I ordered the Salmon Teriyaki and it was pretty tasty.  Together with a plentiful amount of rice and a little side salad, I was quite satisfied.  However, it was not worth waiting the amount of time we did for it - not much is.  If I was considering food alone, I'd give this place much more kudos.  However, the service just ruined the experience for me.  I honestly couldn't wait to get out of there after we finally figured out the split check situation."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place for over a year. I used to regularly go here for sushi until ONE DAY, I picked up a take out order for about $45 and I had just finished paying when I saw a MOUSE run across the doorway of their kitchen behind the cash register area.   I told the waitress and she played stupid with me and said that they had just passed the inspection.  I can't and won't go back there.  So there is no point in critiquing the food there - my guess is most plazas on that strip probably have mice running around or that they were coming in from another store but wth.    This was probably 8 months ago."}
{"text":"This restaurant is across the road from the Whitby Mall.  I had the Thai basil chicken. Service was friendly and attentive.  Food was great, fresh and reasonably fast. A really great restaurant for a long lunch with friends. Prices are very good."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. Learned long ago to go in the bar and avoid the dining area at all costs. Tonight is 25 cent beer night and the bar is full of desperate 20 something beer drinkers so into the dining room we went. The service is beyond horrible just as I remember. Food here is good and a fair price. Not the best sushi but good. Over riding all of this is the amazing ability of the staff to ignore you and lean on their elbows at the reception stand. Avoid eating in the dinning area at all costs. Update: the 25 cent beer in the bar costs $3.00 in the dinning room IN A PLASTIC CUP!  Frat house nights at Shogun!"}
{"text":"Eh...next! Yeah, me no likey so much this place.   The rolls were really really squishy and the rice they use in their sushi for some reason was just a little \"off.\"  And believe me..I KNOW my sushi!  There are many more places for a lot better sushi in Scottsdale and Paradise Valley."}
{"text":"Nestled away in a strip mall is this little place that you would totally miss if you weren't looking for it. Well, that is if you're someone like me who doesn't look at every store in the mall..  You don't hear of many teppanyaki places in the east end, especially on the outskirts of the GTA. But this place deserves to be highly promoted. Not only do they have teppanyaki, but they also have all you can eat sushi (if you're not at the table). Does it get any better than this? I don't know of any place that offers both.  The chef working the table was amazing. He gave us a little pre show by flipping his utensils around before getting started. It was fun but part of the show always entails a little utensil banging just to make it sound like something is going on. He was very lively and was unique, especially when he flipped the lobster shells on top of his hat.  The food was delicious, pretty standard for teppanyaki fare. The good combos will run you anywhere from 24-30 dollars and have combos for 2 and 4, but you can get some sub $20 dishes.  This place used to be called Sushi Boat and has switched owners. I just hope people realize how awesome this place is and keep it going because when owners change you fear that the business may be in trouble, and this place is too good to get gobbled up by the restaurant bankruptcy demons."}
{"text":"Wow...Epic Fail in all arenas...Upon walking in for our first time visit, we were not greeted for a few minutes as the two people in the hostess booth were joking around...We were seated (we did tell both the hostess and the server it was our first time)  They sat us at booth next to the kitchen..Raegan was our server..She was pleasant enough, but did seem a little irritated when asking questions about some of the items on the menu (we did mention it was our first time) iT was nice to hear the production line in the kitchen joking and laughing and having a good time.  Truly.  Unfortunately, we now know that it affected the food brought out!! Ugh!! My boyfriend ordered the Lemon Chicken...I had a maguro and sake sushi..and a miso soup...Soup was water for sure with some tofu.  Sushi was not good, and chef didn't know how to make the rice stick together apparently...The lemon chicken on the other hand was nothing as the description on menu.  The serve was a huge bowl, of rice, with a handful of thin sliced chicken (we think) 2 pieces of Green pepper (was supposed to be sauteed but was raw) and two slices of avocado.  I tasted the chicken as bf said he thought it was dry...OMG!!! dry is not the word...it disinegrated in my hand.  No flavor of lemon present. We waited for server to come and ask how our meal was, so they could have the opportunity to make it right.  She disappeared.  Our waters were never refilled.  (we were there 90 minutes)  We were pretty disappointed...we waited for 20 minutes to be asked how our food was or to get check.  She was gone...So we walked to the front to get our check...The worst service and food ever!!!  Save your money and go ANYWHERE ELSE!  Oh, and not cheap.  Not expensive, but for this bad of food...It should be really cheap..."}
{"text":"This is our absolute favorite neighborhood sushi restaurant.  Their rolls are fantastic, always tasty and just the right size as well.  We've been to many other high end establishments, and while their sushi is typically very good their rolls are more than you can eat in one bite and tend to fall apart, not so at Shogun.  Perfect rolls every time."}
{"text":"Ummm...no. Never again. Panda Express has better food. Wish I could leave a no star review."}
{"text":"Andy at the sushi bar is beyond excellent. He remembered names, showed off a cool octopus and made great sushi!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Shogun for over 20 years and I love it. My all-time favorite, even before it was on the menu, is The Sunshine Roll. I don't find it, or a similar roll, elsewhere. Also a fan of the Big Johnson if I'm feeling ravenous. Service is usually good and they do a great job with carry-out."}
{"text":"I love this place after years and years of going. I always get the turkey salad and am never disappointed. Service is quick and efficient. Atmosphere is nice too."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible!!! The hostess has the absolute worst attitude I have ever seen on a person in the hospitality industry. The food is hit or miss depending on the cook that you get. Be prepared for a wait every time I have been here it's at least an hour before the cook comes out. I won't be back and I don't recommend this place at all!!"}
{"text":"I would have given them one star except the manager the next day handled our situation perfectly!  I ordered a sushi roll (along with my husband) and our children ordered a meal.  I am a little picky since I only like \"soy paper\".  Since I know that people sometimes don't read the paper - we specifically told the waitress \"soy paper\" and pointed it out.  When all the food came; seaweed it was.  We sent it back, no problem.  Well the replacement NEVER came.  She forgot me.  My family was done eating and when she checked on us ONCE, we canceled it.  She was not apologetic, nor handle herself well at all.  When I did call the manager though, he sent us a gift card so we would come back and try them again.  Glad he did, or else we would have been swayed to not go back.  I feel they handled themselves well once the \"person in charge\" knew what happened.!"}
{"text":"How is this place in business?  Seriously!  I'm still angry over how bad this place was.  My brother who was with me agrees.  So here is what happened...  We sit down, look over the menu and instantly notice that the place is super expensive, even for lunch.  Then my brother points out that everyone sitting down seems to be over the age of 50 and eating huge piles of colored salads.  I'm guessing this is the turkey salad.    My theory is that for the price everyone went for quantity.  We skipped the original plan for sushi and rolls because at $12 - $15 at lunch this place did not have the atmosphere or the token chefs to warrant those prices.  We decided to start easy and try the Panko Udon noodle soup with tempura.    My false expectation:  Thick udon noodles, in a nice translucent dark broth, with tiny green onion bits floating on top, paired with a plate of assorted vegetables covered in a light fluffy batter.  Add battered shrimp or fish depending on the place.  All this would then combine in my mouth into that great saliva generating Udon freshness that I have come to love.    It arrived...  -INSERT EXPLETIVE HERE-  The not even joking reality:  Placed in front of me was a white bowl of soy sauce with a pile of store bought rough spaghetti noodles.  Floating in this disappointment was a horror show of deep fried unrecognizable straight from the freezer bag vegetable shapes.  I say shapes because vegetables  usually have flavor which is the whole reason for including them in a dish, these could have been cardboard cutouts soaked in grease.  I wish I was joking about the soy sauce or the noodles.  It tasted like something a Home Ec student from Beverly Hills would have made first day of class.  -INSERT EXPLETIVE HERE AGAIN-  Well we didn't find the hidden camera and only got a few bites into the mess before giving up.  Here is the best part, the bus boy was not at all surprised when he picked up the plates mostly unfinished.  Weird wait staff aside, Shogun is absolutely hands down the worst Sushi place I have ever eaten at.  If you can't do Udon Soup don't put it on the menu.  They should be ashamed for taking that much money from innocent people who don't know what good sushi tastes like.  Avoid the disappointment and save yourself some money.  You're better off at East Wind 1 mile north at Thunderbird and Tatum.  Better yet head to over to Hiro Sushi at Shea and the 101, its absolutely worth the drive.  -INSERT FINAL EXPLETIVE HERE-"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, was prepared very well and tasted amazing. However we were notified that baby octopus are no longer an ingredient on the menu, though it is still listed on the menu. the manager made it right by refunding for the misunderstanding. Overall was a pleasant enough experience"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant. Always go here when I'm in town. Service is great too!"}
{"text":"I yearn for Shogun of the 90's.  I decided to give it another try-Chicken Katsu and Turkey salad here I come.  But I was sadly disappointed.  My first order of Katsu was the size of a credit card, paper thin and greasy.  The kind server offered to replace it but the second was not much better.  The sunomono was fresh and crisp and the rice plentiful-and the Turkey Salad average.  My hubby's Teri Chix looked fried-and once again only a few pieces of chicken.  You can't go home again."}
{"text":"Love this place, I always get the surfer roll...I have to be honest though....I was a bit annoyed last night when I placed a carry out order. The shrimp were dry and chewy, AND, they charged me 15% additional for a carry out order...never seen that before, was irritated by that. Won't carry out there again, but will certainly go back and eat there. I'm just wondering if it is common place in AZ or a sushi restaurant to add on a 15% carry out  \"fee\""}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix! Great price and great service!!! Very good. Always leave happy!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and I love the specials on drinks depending on the say of the week. I got the Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich. I definitely got my money's worth and a very yummy sandwich. I recieved two salads, soup and a giant sandwich. I loved it and had more than enough to take home with me.   I give it four starts because I was in a group and it took one of my friends 10 min after we got our food for her to get the Crunchy Roll. However, once she finally got her food she said it was delicious!"}
{"text":"The rolls were absolutely amazing! Some other items lacked luster. The service was really bad, but the staff was friendly"}
{"text":"So, my husband and I went out for Sushi last night. We tried to get into Yasu, but it was just too busy. I'll blame it on the fact that it was Good Friday. Anyhow, we decided to give Shogun a try.   We entered the restaurant and was quickly shown to the sushi bar. The atmosphere was chill and relaxing. We had the Caterpillar Roll and loved it! The tuna shashimi was fresh and tasty! We even had some quail eggs and Saki.   After finishing our roll, we realized that we lost track of time and had to get tot a birthday party in less than 25 minutes. The chef canceled the last roll and put a rush on our bill. We were able to get out in less than 5 minutes. The staff was friendly, accommodating, and FAST. We will most definitely visit Shogun again!"}
{"text":"Don't order take out!!  Went last week and among sushi we also ordered the whole Turkey Salad, wowsers. Could have had more turkey but tons of cabbage, and peanuts, it was huge and yum. Flash forward to today, ordered whole turkey salad take out...should have inspected. It is literally 1/3 the size we received dining in, has about 1 deli slice of turkey mixed in and no nuts. Called to let management know and was told \"hmm, maybe you ordered a half size\". Yeah no, I ordered and paid for a whole (plus where's the nuts?!?). They could care less that I wasn't happy with my order. Too bad, was going to make this a weekly habit..."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I've never really tried the regular sushi to give a good review of the quality. However, when it comes to their rolls, they are probably some of the best that I have ever had! Based on just a handful of rolls, I have to give a five star review.  ...But there is a little bit of a downside. Most of the rolls that I really enjoy or on their old \"secret \"menu. While they will still make these rolls, you have to know about them to order them. Fortunately I have a photo of these menus and I'm posting them here! Despite its phallic appearance, the big Johnson role is simply phenomenal as is the inferno roll. Those two rolls on their own are enough for two people!"}
{"text":"This place deserves more like 3.5 stars, but not quite 4. It's not consistent, that's for certain. When they're on their game, the food is exceptional; when they're off, it can be pretty blah. Tempura is either perfectly crispy & hot (which is the usual experience), or lukewarm and soggy. Sashimi can be gorgeous or meh. Rolls are typically good. Fish is almost always super fresh. But... I swear it's next to impossible to get a glass of ice water without asking at least 2-3 times. However, I keep returning bc it's 1.5 miles from my house, their prices are pretty good, and I love the bartender, Jess. She immediately knows what I drink and eat; it's almost like I never need a menu. Besides her, though, the service here is sub par.  Pretty good HH (all night in bar area, 7 nights a week!), 25 cent drafts on Mondays, $2.50 (??) small sakes on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"This is unacceptable!! The bathroom was a complete nightmare. They should know better!"}
{"text":"Expensive and slow, but once we were served, it was good. I liked the New York roll. They did have gluten-free tamari, so that's a plus. The atmosphere is nice and the staff knows their stuff, once you can get their attention. With other sushi restaurants within ginger-throwing distance, it is easy to keep moving on to another."}
{"text":"Food was great. I had tempura for dinner. Also had 2 pieces of tuna and 2 pieces of yellowtail sushi. All good. Soybeans were cooked well, seasalt delicious. Iced tea was refreshing. Service was a little awkward, I think the girl was very new though so no big deal.  Lots of seating there on Memorial Day. No reservations taken for small parties, ours was 5 people.  Prices for the 2 piece sushi were higher than most places. Happy hour sushi wasn't as good of a deal as, say, Sushi 101, in Tempe on University."}
{"text":"We were here yesterday for a birthday lunch. Perfect. Quiet and peaceful. Not always the case at night time however. Sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed chatting with our sushi chef who made us a special dish. A very fun experience and the food was delicious. Learned that beer on Monday night is $.25 a glass and sake on Wednesday night, same price. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I like cold Sapporo on tap, so for this reason, I like Shogun.  I do not order sushi, rather, gyoza are my menu pick, at the bar, in and out.    It's quick, dark, and takes care of my 80's music quota for the month.  A typical stop-in is for a beer and a snack in between shopping-always makes the errands much more enjoyable...."}
{"text":"Tried this place out last year after seeing a balance of good and bad reviews.    Thought, what the hell, let's give them a chance. Should have gone down the street.    totally disappointing.  Bad attitude, indifferent decor, bland food, way too much money for what you get."}
{"text":"This place was so disappointing.  Maybe they are known for their sushi, but since we were there for noodles, we didn't order sushi.  Unfortunately, their udon dish that they used to have in a broth was no longer on the menu.  Our server barely spoke english so we had a language barrier and she kept insisting we order their udon dish that was stir fried.  Instead I ordered their garlic chicken dish with rice.  The chicken was OLD and you could tell it had been flash fried quite a few times.  It was rough and wouldn't even tear apart when I was trying to cut the chicken into smaller pieces.  I couldn't even finish my dish.  The husband had these pork cutlets that he said was way too sweet and extremely dry.  He, too, had a hard time cutting his pork.  We ordered our son the udon stir fry and he ate about 4 bites and said he was \"full\".  So about $50 later, we left hungry and irritated and swearing we'd never come back here again.  So sad."}
{"text":"This was one of the earliest and has been the longest enduring asian restaurant in Gastonia. The food is good, the service is good and the locaiton is good."}
{"text":"Probably wouldn't go back for sushi. I was here for dinner twice & lunch once & we decided they just aren't good. Sushi prices are easily beat elsewhere, food really wasn't anything special. Okay-ish drink happy hour but the service is terrible & the restaurant is always dirty. Just skip it & go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Have not been here in some time but the food and service is still very good. Our favorite is still the Karage Chicken and Tempura. Also shared the Pork Katsu which was a little on the hard side.   The service was very good considering we had 20 and they were very prompt to ensure your glass was filled.  Prices are average and will not break the bank, ask to see if they have the dinner for 2 for $29.99 which has a appetizer 2 entrees and dessert.  Restaurant is very family friendly and also nice for a quiet dinner for 2"}
