{"text":"Not the best sushi in town, but a close second! The wait staff more than made up for it though. Very relaxed environment and good food."}
{"text":"Jesus Christ the Gyoza appetizer was bomb. I ordered 1 and then 2 more. Sushi was typical but tasty. Drinks were good. The waterfall, koi pond, \"walking over the bridge\" entrance and was a little over the top. If you go...get the Gyoza and extra dipping sauce on the side! Yeah!"}
{"text":"Let's get this out on the table. Yes, I am a sushi snob. My standards don't expect Morimoto next to the lake but yeah I have experienced awe inducing sushi and I expect a little effort... that said. Cheap. You get what you pay for with this place. I've been twice. Once for sushi, once for Hibachi. Disapointed twice. Chirashi that was served as sashimi. Very little fish and not the best quality. Sushi Chef doesn't even talk to you.  Hibachi was just as frustrating! cheap meat and vegetables that I have never seen served at a Hibachi place before. Carrots and Broccoli. Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. The server was a tattooed white guy who was play acting a Japanese accent. Insulting.   Will look for better places maybe closer to Cleveland."}
{"text":"We have had good experiences at Wasabi Steakhouse.  We love the one dipping sauce and the food has always been good.  It's not exceptional food, but for the money it is tasty and the service has been excellent.  It is a good value."}
{"text":"I've given this place the benefit of the doubt. The past two times have been spot on. Both the food and service were great. The hostesses actually greet you with a smile now. I plan to go back again."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in beach wood I come here and it's better than the last time . The sushi is outstanding and the bartenders are great always attentive to your needs."}
{"text":"Great place to go in groups and get a wet tshirt! Lol i went with my family and friend for the first time about 2weeks ago.GREAT FOOD GREAT ENTERTAINMENT GREAT STAFF! our chef was hilarious n strangely obsessed with Rihanna (kept singing \"whats my name all night\") lmao! Food was great. I had some of the dragon roll and the shrimp and scallop hibachi combo! And lots and lots of saki.  And can i say the chefs definitely free pour on the saki shots! \"Wasabi sloppy\" is what they call it. Better than the typical bennihana i think. Go in groups and get wasabi sloppy.i enjoyed it. And its a beautiful place quite pricey...but u get what u pay 4."}
{"text":"Place is great and the prices are comparable to other hibachi restaurants, they have an awesome lunch hibachi where every meal is under ten dollars.  Nice sushi bar, very fresh and well prepared"}
{"text":"First off scenery great. The cook sucked our food was not that tasty. Me and the wife ordered Extra shrimp and was shorted ten shrimp had to complain. When I spend 75 dollars on dinner which I think is crazy for rice and veggies and extra shrimp, and the scenery is better then the food. Well I let u decide for yourself.lol two stars. !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I would have to disagree with what other reviewer said. Husband & I decided to check out Wasabi on a date night after dropping son off at summer camp. Had never been to a hibachi before but wanted to try something new. We started with the Angry Dragon Maki Roll. OMG did it look beautiful and taste delicious. The head and tail of the dragon were made from a crunchy shrimp wrapped in rice paper. Our chef was very entertaining and everyone at the table had fun watching him. I had the lobster and shrimp combo. So yummy! The rice and noodles were amazing too. And I beg to differ on the young yuppie hipster comment too on only other review here. There were a lot of families there. The little girl at the table behind us was laughing and really enjoying the show her chef put on for her. We'll definitely go back and next time bring our son along too :)"}
{"text":"Nice koi pond and ambiance. Service was good and sushi was fresh.  Ironically they provided no wasabi with either roll, nor ginger.  I got the Angry Dragon. Very different, not in a good or bad way.  Just a 'what did I just eat?\" Kind of way - minus the shrimp tempura which was obvious. Lots of sauce overload on the plate."}
{"text":"If you have a weight or cholesterol issue, the \" angry dragon\" will bite you in the you-know-what.. But, as we all know; everything taste SOOOOOO GOOOD when we know it's SOOOO BAD for us. I'm hooked. Definitely worth the splurge.... And the place looks so amazing!"}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite resteraunts back home! Mind you, I've lived in Japan for years so I know authentic Japanese food and this is as close as it gets! I haven't been to too many Japanese steak houses that tastes as authentic as this one, most of them are pretty americanized :(. I am a huge fan of the miso soup and gyoza (dumplings). I had my graduation pary here and the autmosphere is beautiful and the chefs are so entertaining! Service is quick! This place rocks and this is at the top of my list of resteraunts to go to when I come back home!"}
{"text":"Service was fast, food was decent.  Prices were fair.  Staff was nice. Scenery was cool. I'd go back. Not the beat sushi I've had but not bad."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the sushi here!! Get the angry dragon and the autumn roll! Delicious! Great service, can get very busy too."}
{"text":"Had the worst dining experience of my life.   Arrived on  time and still had to wait.  Hostess was not at the front desk so we waited 14 minutes for her to show up.   Waited another 20 minutes once seated.  Manger was the poorest excuse for a manager that I have encountered"}
{"text":"I just love this place, staff is friendly they keep you smiling. And it's always great to meet new people"}
{"text":"Keep driving. Perhaps hibachi is good. Ordered three items from the non-hibachi menu. Ebi shumai (shrimp) were small and bland. Hamachi jalape√±o had no zip or spice, and worst of all, calamari tempura was barely warm and tough. Sent it back, came back quickly and it was hot and tough. The batter was not delicate, lacked taste, and was clearly cooked previously and heated up. Mikuni's in Sacramento   area (several) is the best, and I had hoped this would be a similar experience. Disappointed and not planning to return.  Wait person was prompt, friendly, and apologetic."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the fresh sushi is amazing. They also have a hibachi restaurant. The bar is great for hanging with friends and catching a game."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a very unique interior, lots of glass and water. Their service, on the other hand, is a typical one for that particular area... Too long to get seated. Our waiter was unprofessional. Sushi is okey, I think our Heinens store sells better sushi and sashimi. It was just plain. This was out second time at wasabi and I don't think we will be coming back any time soon. There are much better sushi places near by such as Sushi Rock or Pacific East."}
{"text":"Had some time to burn in Elyria yesterday. Walked thru the Midway Mall Food Court the longest line was at Taco Bell. So I looked at the mixed reviews on YELP about Wasabi and wandered in to eat. They have a Lunch Special M-F not on a Saturday at 3pm. Ordered the 3 Maki \"deal.\" Excuse me but the Nori/Seaweed wrap for Maki Rolls should be crispy not soggy and chewy. You need to close the bags and store it properly when not it is in use. 10.99 for 3 Maki Rolls and 2.50 for the House Salad with one shred of carrot and a combination of romaine and iceberg lettuce. What is it with sushi places splitting one or two shrimp in half in a Boston Roll and no Roe on the outside. Reminds me of the crappy place Ohashi at Great Northern. I must remember to only spend my Sushi dollars at Pacific East until I venture further East."}
{"text":"Well this fine dining establishment has really taken a plunge.  First the positives--excellent hibachi chef, excellent food.  Now the negatives.  Booked a party 1 week in advance.  I was told on the phone that the party wouldn't be seated until we had all arrived-fine.  Final member of our party arrived around 7:20.  They then gave us a buzzer and said they were cleaning a table.   7:40, still cleaning a table.  8pm-they seated another party ahead of us.  We checked to see why we were bypassed--oh it was an error and they are going to move the other party.  Next, the waitress partially gave a crap--maybe because she knew her 18% gratuity was a given?  (Side note-The system is skewed with the whole tipping situation but that's a whole other story.)  Anyway, the women's bathroom looked like a nasty men's room.  I alerted the manager (who also didn't seem to give a crap) and explained that I understood it was a saturday night and that it was busy but usually a fine dining establishment would not allow their restrooms to get that bad...especially on YOUR BUSIEST NIGHT FOR BUSINESS.  Doesn't it make sense that you restaurant would want to function at its best during peak hours?  Instead--organized chaos.  I loved the food but we came for the EXPERIENCE most importantly.  The hibachi area was so smoky as if they didnt use their vents.  Sorry but I wasn't impressed enough to bring back my big dollars--i work too hard for my money.  Btw, for two of us (myself and my husband) in our party, our bill was $130--not that i was sticker shocked because we were returning customers but im pointing out that the service should've been pristine.  Oh and thats not including the drinks while we were waiting to be seated or the large tip that was given to our chef (probably earned $100 from just our table).  Finally, I just read an interesting yelp review from Nov 2015 about how dirty the behind the scenes are from an interviewee's perspective...I certainly won't be back...gross."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to take someone to! The chefs put on the best show and the food is outstanding. The lunch has huge portions and is reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"I went here last night for the first time for an anniversary dinner. Coincidentally, it was also Sweetest Day, so many couples were out. We made reservations for the hibachi offerings. This was my first time also eating at a hibachi restaurant. It was a dinner and a show. The chef was very skilled. Compared to other chefs in the area, our chef seemed to be the most skilled in terms of knife tricks and very entertaining. The only complaint I had was with the other party in my section. People of the other party asked for more garlic, seasoning, etc. to be added to the food while it was cooking. Mind you, everyone's food is cooked together and then portioned off and served. My food was so garlicky and salty due to the requests of the other party, but good nonetheless. The price was around $60 for me and my partner, and that included soup, salad, and servings of fried rice and noodles with our meal. We both ordered and the Chicken and Shrimp, which was about $23 each without the fried rice. You get a huge portion of food, so our bill was understandable. Be prepared to have a lot of leftovers, which is a good thing in my book."}
{"text":"Great experience! The food was delicious, I had the Sirloin Hibachi and it was way more than I could eat. Chef Harvey was very entertaining and everything he prepared was very tasty. Really nice that they asked if we were celebrating anything, and as we were, they gave us an ice cream dessert. It was also nice that we could order from the sushi menu even though we were on the hibachi side. Service was in general very good as well. We will certainly come back!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. I've been here before and always enjoyed it but now I may never go back. I never complain but this is necessary. I went to the independence location 12/19/17. I usually would get a steak and shrimp combo but being pregnant and not able to get my steak med rare how I like it, this time I opted for the chicken. I had one piece of the chicken and noticed it was either really chewy or undercooked. I was at a table with several other guests and didn't want to be rude spitting it out so I just didn't eat any more chicken. That night I was up all night and the entire next day terribly sick with shooting pains. My husband and I both looked through my leftovers and found more undercooked chicken.  The following day when I was starting to feel better I went in to complain and the young lady manager I talked to essentially called me a liar saying that salmonella and food poisoning takes days to hit the body and make you sick. She also said that since nobody else has complained it must be either something I ate somewhere else or the flu. She then told me I can call the health inspector if I want because they have nothing to hide. She had an attitude and sent me on my way without even apologizing or offering anything to compensate my experience. (Not that I was looking for freebies but I didn't even eat the meal).  I lost 8 pounds in a day and could have lost my baby over this. I have been searching for corporate information and cannot find it. Never experienced such poor customer service in my life."}
{"text":"Looooove it. Great atmosphere. If you want great food and a great time, try this place!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Hibachi restaurants I've been to. Love the atmosphere and design. Great hospitality. Our chef was John who is TOP NOTCH, both in presentation skills and cooking skills. Would definitely recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"If you like sushi,  you'll love Wasabi! Our favorites are the Friends Roll, Cleveland Browns roll,  and Volcano roll.  Dine in.  You'll love it!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best sushi spot in Cleveland. The menu is extensive so you can never get bored, the restaurants decor is modern and trendy and the service is not bad. They also have a section for hibachi (if your into that kind of thing).   I've been to many of the sushi restaurants in cleveland and out of all of them, this is the only one I ever wanna come back to. The fish is always super fresh. I've been here many times and have never been disappointed.   I recommend the Christmas role and the autumn role."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!   Great service, food and environment, and value.   Rare to find all four anymore."}
{"text":"Ordered the Teriyaki Salmon dinner with a side of chicken. Not impressed. The salmon was very greasy. The seasonings are bland. The miso soup was gross and lukewarm. The ingredients in all of my meal did not taste fresh or flavorful. Having a Japanese Aunt, I know what real Japanese food is. And this was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I love wasabi always a great atmosphere be prepared to have a $100 bill I always do but  with my wife of course anyway I always have a good time there no matter the bill amount and the food is great"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi. I'm visiting from out of town, but would make this a regular stop if it was in my hometown. The spicy tuna wasn't the best spicy tuna I've had, but the Dragon roll and Ichido roll were great. The Ichido was on the special board, but had spicy tuna, avocado, scallions and cheddar cheese topped with filet mignon, eel sauce, and spicy mayo. Definitely a little unique with the red meat, but I'd have it again. I'll definitely stop back next time in town!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, delicious food, friendly staff and they squirt saki in your mouth.  Current record is 49 seconds. Can you beat it?"}
{"text":"Sushi chef was great. Japanese looking fellow. Didn't get his name. Attentive and produced quality product.   Restaurant was dirty as the motel across the street. Oil slick in front of the bar. Check book covered in grease. Why is this place so oily?"}
{"text":"I really cannot tell you if the food was good or not.  They sat us in a side room that did not have heat in the middle of winter. It was so cold that everyone at our table had to have their food packed up to go.  The management nor the server seemed to care."}
{"text":"I can't believe it, but I'm done looking for my favorite sushi place--this is definitely it!! I came here for date night before hitting up the movies, and I can't even tell you how satisfied I left. The price is right and I was quite full sharing two rolls with my boyfriend. The decor: super cool and trendy, but not pretentious. I liked feeling like I was somewhere nicer without having to feel \"uppity\". The service: awesome. Hostess sat us right away and our server was so friendly, had great suggestions, and brought us everything we needed in a timely manner. Food: OMG. To the people who recommended the Angry Dragon roll: you weren't kidding! This might be the best sushi roll I've ever had. We also got a Lobster Roll which was delicious. I can't wait to try the rest of the EXTENSIVE sushi menu!! Drinks: We realized after we smashed the rolls in approximately two minutes that we had a lot of time to kill before the movie, so we decided to stay for drinks. We each got one of their specialty \"saketini\" type drinks (basically typical cocktails with sake mixed in for a cool twist). I believe they were $7 and they were STRONG. We were feeling them after just one! Boyfriend got the Caribbean Sake which tasted like a White Russian--delicious! I can't remember what mine was called but I remember it was blue and had Hypnotiq in it, and I don't know which of our drinks was more awesome. The meal and experience would have been awesome at any price, but we walked out having paid a ridiculously reasonable tab. I will come back here every chance I get!"}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant is nice.  Service at the bar left something to be desired.  I felt like the bartender thought she was above serving drinks.  She also didn't know how to make the martini my friend wanted and they were out of the wine I first ordered.  Sat on Hibachi side and our chef was nice and funny.  The food was good, though the rice was a little over-greased.  This place is a good option for Hibachi, but I probably wouldn't come here to eat off of the regular menu."}
{"text":"I thought, for the price I got excellent sashimi. It was fresh and good assortment for $50. Did not eat hibatchi."}
{"text":"Not a terrible place -- but certainly not A+ sushi.  One point that seems picky, but is a BIG deal to me: the bathroom doesn't have paper towels, only one of those horrible hand dryers that blows dirty water in your face and hurts your ears.  Then, you have to touch the door handle, without paper towels, to get out.  Considering that most sushi is meant to be picked up with your hands, the horrible bathroom arrangement is ALL KINDS of gross."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened, and am happy to say they have hit their stride. You can do sushi side or hibachi side (the chefs have fun with it & might squirt sake into your mouth if you're good...or maybe bad) Blue bubbles at the bar are always soothing, and they have a decent wine list. Some coming and going of bartenders & sorry but if you tend bar in this area, please know how to make an espressotini!! Please.   Anyway, food is always consistent and good. The \"angry dragon\" is my pick for sushi, always a hit. But talk to who's working and see what they recommend that day... Candace the manager is awesome, she really goes the distance to make everyone happy. Even when a member of your party has stolen the gong & is running thru the restaurant... oh ya, good times, great wasabi!"}
{"text":"My fav place!! Love the entertainment and the food!! My fav place to eat!! Eaten here countless of times!! Strongly suggest the steak hibachi and California roll and lobster"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come here once a week for half price sushi (M-Th, 4:30-6)!  The sushi is awesome and obviously the price is amazing!  For two of us, it ends up being just $16 for 6 maki rolls!  Our favorites are spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy crab, California, regular salmon, and last but certainly not least, Philadelphia roll!  Service is always excellent as well!"}
{"text":"The food is great for the most part, service, not so much. I admit I completely trashed Wasabi over some new servers ignorance in adding 18% gratuity for EVERY person at a table when they didn't know each other and are separate parties. I sincerely hope that was a one time thing and has been dealt with accordingly. Make sure to check your receipts people!!!!   Now the review...  Word to the wise: if you want alcohol then get it before you sit down because it drastically slows down service when you order tableside.  I've been intimate with the Wasabi since first going to the Canton location many moons ago. From there, the Beachwood and Independence locations are no different. Except that for some odd reason the Independence location allows you to bring dogs in. WTF?! No joke...Sat at a hibachi table with 6 others guests, and 2 of them had a small lap-dog chihuahua tableside. Regardless if it was a service/therapy dog or not that is just unacceptable and NOT the place to have such things. Whatever, anyways....  No matter what location you go to I'd say you get a pretty damn good deal for what you pay. Whatever hibachi dinners you choose, you get miso soup (just don't spill it! because it's the best part), and in addition to your meal you get some shrimp, vegetables, and even noodles with your rice and meats/seafood. The noodles rule. The first rule of Wasabi is: Do NOT spill your miso soup. The second rule of Wasabi is: Do NOT spill your miso soup.  Willy rules. The \"show\" is just like all the rest of the Japanese hibachis...all the same..nothing special unless your some dumb child. I come for the food and not the show obviously. Sushi was great despite me not being privy to avocado and mayo in any sushi (red dragon), but it was tasty despite the dumb modernization. I had WAY to much to drink and didn't pick up on the avocado.   The busser people did an absolute shit job cleaning up after the last table. Dried soap marks across the marble, dirty plates, grease puddles. No excuse to not be clean despite being busy. I could have done with a more attentive waitress during the \"show\" and after being served. I was so damn disappointed no one noticed I spilled my miso soup  to offer me another. I cleaned up though, your welcome. All of this was on a busy Saturday. Again, food is GREAT, but, service can use some work at times. NO excuse for anything the server or busser's did above."}
{"text":"This is the best hibachi chain in Cleveland. Service is always amazing and the food is always right. I just went to the Beachwood location too they are all amazing."}
{"text":"Okay so first, I was REALLY excited to try this place.  As soon as you walk in, you walk over water with a bunch of exotic fish in it.  You choose whether you want to go the traditional route or the fancy we-cook-it-right-in-front-of-you route.  There is a wall that has bubbles and water and it just has a great, fun vibe.  So here is the part that is difficult.  I WANTED to like it.  You walk in and you get the concept of the restaurant and you want it to be good.  But I've been there three times and each time it has gone downhill.  The food is 4/5 and there are some really cool-looking rolls that they make specific to that restaurant.  But the service was worse and worse every time.  On a Tuesday, we ordered four regular rolls... and proceeded to wait for almost 50 minutes to get them.  There were only four other tables filled in the room and I still have no idea what took so long.  Then when the rolls came my friend got both of hers and she only gave me one of the two I ordered.  By the time the second one I had ordered came, it had been well over an hour from when I originally ordered it.  We kept trying to give the benefit of the doubt, but the table next to us had already come, eaten and left by the time I got my second roll.  Our drinks were filled maybe once the entire time.  It was overall a very poor experience.    The reason I'm giving 3/5 is because the building and setting itself is really fun and awesome, the food is pretty good, but the service was quite bad.  Not sure if I will be back again.  Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"I went last night and I have to give it 5 stars because everything was perfect! The service was phenomenal and the food was amazing! I couldn't have asked for a better experience."}
{"text":"Wasabi is the place to go when you feel like having Hibachi!!... Whenever I have Evan as a waiter and Henry as the hibachi chef, I always walk away happy... Request them and you won't be disappointed in your visit.. The food is amazing and they give you plenty:) Delicious Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Surprising gem located in/at Midway Mall. Their food is always fresh. I like sushi and sashimi, so this is a real treat for me.  Been here several times. Service is always very good.  I like that they have seating near the bar and also in a main dining room, too.  It's good for big groups. The only thing that is off a bit is that they use the wrong type of glass for red wine; but that isn't a deal breaker for me..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here every Wednesday for the half-price maki rolls.  Since we're pretty much regulars here, we get great service.  The sushi is never disappointing either!  And at $2.50 to $3 a roll, you can't beat it.  So good"}
{"text":"I personally think Wasabi is the best hibachi restaurant in all of NEO. The fillet is melt in your mouth amazing and the sushi is on point. I love that they give you lo mein noodles in addition to the fried rice. Although I think that the canton location is the nicest, Beachwood still holds it down!"}
{"text":"I went on labor day this place gave me food poisoning I will never eat there again and I would never suggest this place to anyone. I'm pretty sure the food was not fresh and had already spoiled. I was sick for two days. Do not eat here"}
{"text":"Shocked at horrible service. Sign on door states restaurant closes for lunch at 2:30.  I walked in at 2:01 and asked to sit at bar to grab fast lunch.  Hostess said no we are closed.  I pointed out the sign said they close at 2:30. She commented last table seating was at 2:00. I told her it was just me and I would just grab something fast at the bar, I didn't need a table. She said no we are closed. Why would you lose a customer over 1 minute?  Especially if they were alone and planned to grab something fast at the bar.  There are a lot of restaurants that appreciate a customer.  Not this one."}
{"text":"I came in here for the Hibachi. My friends set up a \"surprise\" birthday for me and we decided to come to Wasabi Japanese Steakhouse.   They take reservations, which is great because I don't think we would have gotten a seat in the packed restaurant on a Thursday at 6:00pm. The place is located in Beachwood and has a lot of available parking spots. When you walk in, you walk through a sort of \"bridge\" that is over a Japanese style pond. The front of the restaurant is very cool, with blue ambient lighting that sets the mood. It's a bit dark in the restaurant which gives a very interesting aura, and it seems like a really good place to take a girl on a date.  We came in with a party of 8, and were seated right away. The back wall is illuminated blue with a glass pane filled with water. It's hard to describe, but very good. The restaurant is very upper-class looking yet comfortable. I ordered a Caribbean Sake ($8) which was strong but good. I also got the swordfish ($21) Hibachi style. The chicken is $16 and they also have veggie ($15) along with many other things. Each dish comes with a huge helping of fried rice sprinkled with soy sauce, fried veggies, chow mein, along with either miso soup or chicken broth with this really good fried onion thing in it. The waiter was awesome and very nice. He even brought me out a drink on the house since it was my birthday. There were probably about 8 other birthdays there, and each time they would come out with an cymbal-dong-thing, banging it and singing happy birthday to the person. It freaked me out the first several times, but after the 6th time, I got used to it.  The guy who cooked the food for us was cool - he wasn't asian, but hispanic? I'm guessing. He was really funny and had a lot of energy. He would make comments about all of us, for instance \"Are you two dating?\" (to my friends who weren't but would make a good couple) which made us all laugh like crazy. He also made comments like \"Looks like Lady gaga is here!\" which confused us because we didn't know if he was talking to us or what...No idea. He also said stuff like \"Be careful, it's hot like you\" to one of my friends. He was like \"You suck!\" to me after I tried to catch a piece of shrimp in my mouth and missed, which I thought was hilarious. Haha. Dinner and entertainment. Of course since it's Hibachi style, they do a lot of tricks, such as creating huge flames, doing fancy knife tricks, and the sort. They even have sake in a squirt bottle that they squirt in your mouth, which I did for 9 seconds before it spilled on my sweater.  The food was cooked perfectly - the swordfish was cooked thoroughly and extremely soft. First time having swordfish and I loved it. Delicious. I usually eat a LOT and the portions were enough to make me feel content. It might have also been the alcohol.  Overall, the place has a great atmosphere which makes it a great place to go with friends or on a date. The prices are a bit high, but I was very impressed when the waiter came out with 8 separate checks - without us even asking - and he knew exactly who ordered what. I was really impressed by that! Professional waiter. Good food, great service, and a fun night. For about 25 bucks per person (food, drinks, and tip included), this makes for a fun night. I would recommend trying it out if you've never been to Wasabi before."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill over the past few years. I'm not sure if they are trying to save money or they are having money issues because today was a pretty warm day and upon arriving at the restaurant, all off the doors were propped open. I found that to be strange for this to be a high scale hibachi restaurant why don't you have the ac on?  No restaurant should ever have the doors of the establishment wide open because it's a health code violation and who wants bugs coming in?    Not too pleased with the current ventilation situation, I choose to stay because I was really craving hibachi and sushi.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was pretty nice and efficient.  I asked her about the doors and she said they were open because the heat and to let the smoke out. Moving forward I placed my order and then noticed that the bartender went to the back to make another guest and my salad. Hmmm that's interesting why is the bartender handling food with no hair restraint and after touching money and who knows what. While the bartender is away other guest come sit at the bar and are waiting and looking around confused bc there is no one there to help them (She's in the back bc she has to tend bar and be a cook). She comes back and the salad is in a small bowl with one cherry tomato one cucumber and dressing running all down the side. Are they really trying to save money by sacrificing the quality of the food and service  or what! This was getting very weird. I mean you just don't expect these things when you are paying over $40 for a meal. I ordered the Mexican roll which I don't get why it was called Mexican roll when it didn't have anything in it to remind me of Mexican food. It was simply shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber, and a spicy mayo sauce. For my meal I had the shrimp and chicken combo hibachi and my plate was covered in liquid from the veggies and some kinda very thin sauce. The food was ok very garlicky and no taste. I tried to season it myself with a little salt and pepper but it was so bland not even the yum yum sauce helped. For the amount of money you pay this place needs to have better tasting food and not to mention the women's bathroom was a complete mess. They have no paper towels or way to dry your hands because the hand dryer stopped working.   Needless to say I will not be returning to this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"We arrived at the restaurant just before six o' clock.  When we first walked in, I thought there would be a long wait.  The restaurant looks packed.  We only waited 15 minutes, didn't realize they had more cooking tables in another separate back private room.  The whole family loved the entertaining chef.  The food was also very good.  We pretty much tried and shared everything between the 8 of us.  Service was surprising swift considering that it was a packed Saturday night.  Worth the drive to Cleveland, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you get a chance to go...make sure you request Chef Dede. He was funny and entertaining. The food was excellent. I had the chicken and ny strip which I must say that the chicken was cooked perfectly. The steak was excellent as well. There is not one complaint that I could have made."}
{"text":"Sushi wasnt bad and the coconut shrimp app was good. My lady ordered a side of the fried rice which was good also. Thats just it though, nothing really stuck out and it all was just good. Even the sushi menu is just ok. No rolls where you read the description and say to yourself, I have to try that. For such mediocre food the price is way too high."}
{"text":"Zombie Rum, Apricot Brandy, Pineapple Juice, Passion Fruit, Juice & Lime Juice  Try it You'll like it"}
{"text":"Worst sushi ever. The fish was NOT fresh. The Unagi Nigiri was not smoked or grilled, but raw with slimy skin, fishy and gross! The spider roll was fishy smelling and the texture was not right. The firecracker roll was ok, but the whole meal was ruined with everything else.  The bartender was unfriendly when she was around and only smiled when it was time to write in a tip amount.  Maybe the hibachi is better? Seems like that would be difficult to screw up."}
{"text":"Very nice place. I've been to the location in Canton as well and I've never been disappointed. The server was attentive, short wait time and the food....omg the food tastes impeccable! The drinks were strong and the atmosphere was so relaxing.   When we went I was soooo wishy washy because I wanted hibachi but didn't want to sit with a bunch of strangers I just wanted a private conversation so I had the option of sitting on the other side or at the bar. I could have hibachi unless I sat at the bar and I was a little disappointed at first but it was so worth sitting at the table in a nice quiet area.   Only flaw was they need dust. The fake plants next to us was filled with Cobb Webb's and dust so I tried to move my chair and food far away."}
{"text":"While I love the Hibachi style of cooking, this place was very sad. The chairs were all torn up, which was the first thing I noticed. The Drinks were very late in coming, got them after we ate the soup and salad. The Hibachi chef started off very slow and unfriendly, but gained some momentum as the meal wore on. They left all the dirty dishes and the \"to go\" boxes on the grill as we were finishing up. It was pretty unsatisfactory and very unprofessional, and very dirty. The waiter announced at the end of the meal that an 18% gratuity was usually added on, but he didn't add it. ??? Probably will not go back."}
{"text":"I feel really bad for the waitstaff in this place. It's like the owner put a billboard up on Kinsman road telling these people to come in this place and treat the waitstaff like shit. I watched my server yesterday being ridiculed and tormented by one of her tables. The manager did step in and defend her, but the poor girl was in tears for trying to do her job. This is one place that should add on 18% gratuity to every check, even just for 1 or 2 people. When I did manage to get her to speak to me, she only would say that the people who come in here aren't very nice. Bless her heart, I would have left immediately if I had a whole table gang up on me. No doubt that's why I never really see the same people working in there when I go, which is rather frequently. I was really just amazed at the trashy, disgusting actions of the people at this table. Some animals need to be kept in cages. Next time I think I will go to Independence, just so I don't have to interact with total trash as I try to enjoy my awesome food!"}
{"text":"Very high quality of food. The staff was very nice & service was quick. Our chef was hilarious! The only reason I am giving this place a 4 is because all I can taste in garlic & I ate there 4 hours ago."}
{"text":"I just moved here from Hawaii and have spent a lot of time in Tokyo. I can say without a doubt the sushi and sashimi at wasabi was very high quality for a very reasonable price. We ordered the tempura fried calamari, hot sake, seaweed salad, and the Wasabi Special for two, which we split 3 ways. The special had very generous portions of salmon, ahi, and yellowtail sashimi, all firm and tender and melt-in-your mouth goodness. I started to cry, but realized it was the exceptionally strong wasabi. Highly recommend the cool (and cold) sushi bar, but can't speak to the hibachi. The hot lava cake was only 3-star good."}
{"text":"Simply the worst service I have ever received. I've never been refused service by any other restaurant! The server had the nerve to tell me he couldn't serve me hibachi on the sushi side, something I've done a dozen times since this location opened because I don't like sitting in the grease fumes on the hibachi side. They do takeout for hibachi, how is it any harder to bring it to a table?"}
{"text":"First time here and I am a sushi lover. I travel for work all around the United States and enjoy sushi mostly on the west coast. I really never eat sushi in Ohio but thought I would try. Sat at the sushi bar and had quick service. Ordered the Vegas roll  $12 and Sashimi Deluxe $22 , wife does not like sushi and ordered the Lobster Teriyaki dinner. $27.   Will have to say the sushi roll and sashimi where surprisingly good !   Wife also liked the the lobster , 2 nice size tails with veggies.   Had a good meal and will return"}
{"text":"We stoped in for dinner stay at a hotel nearby. The restaurant and staff we great service was great no complaints ordered steak hiabatchi  husband got swordfish and the kids got chicken . Let's start with the soup and salad soup no taste hot water salad had so much water in it  it washed out the dressing lettuce was fresh and crisp . Now for the main meal meat and fish was great rice and noodles were not so good basically taste like garlic. We love garlic and use it in every meal but this was just too much . Love my local hiabatchi  in ny  this place didn't compare. Bit staff and environment was great"}
{"text":"First time at Wasabi in Independence.  Went with friends on a Friday night and the place was hopping!  Great atmosphere in the bar area -- the bartenders were very prompt, friendly, and offered great suggestions.  I ordered one of the Pinot's by the glass and it was excellent.  Once our entire party was gathered we were seated in the steakhouse dining room.  Now about the food:  I ordered the hibachi scallops which like all the dinners comes with salad, soup, noodles and rice with the entree.  The  soup and salad were just so so.  My scallops were flavored a little too heavily with teriyaki sauce although the scallops themselves were high quality.   The consensus at the table was that the noodles were a little too greasy.   I shared green dragon sushi with one of my friends and that was the best part of my meal.   Super fun atmosphere -- would definitely go back for the sushi."}
{"text":"Tried this place near work with a friend, and was not very impressed by the service or the food.  I am extremely picky about all fish, let alone sushi, and some met the mark, while others didn't.  It seemed like anything \"prepared\" completely lacked seasoning(salt).  The tempura rock shrimp were almost inedible, though  the sushi was pretty good.  A server sat down right next to us and counted her tips, BS'd with the bartender, and acted as if no guests were there.  The food might have been a little above three stars, but with the (lack of) service, I can't justify anything above a three for this visit."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, sushi, & cocktails. I started with a \"Backyard Tea\" and an eel roll. It was happy hour, so the roll was $2.50!!  Next I went for the octopus sashimi & a Montrose roll.  It was delicious with a little kick to it.  The fish was super fresh & didn't taste like it had been sitting out for days. Afterwards, I had a \"peach mule\" to drink and it was fabulous & refreshing!  The restaurant is gorgeous - a water wall behind the bar, koi pond at the entryway, and a bamboo wall to boot!  The bartender was amazing - she was super sweet & was not stingy with the pours. It wasn't too much, just right. There were tons of people in there and everybody was laughing - that's always a good sign!  I wish there was one of these in Atlanta!  If I am ever back in Independence I will be back to Wasabi! (They also have a hibachi, which I didn't try but looked really yummy). LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"Stunning. I eat sushi all over the country and this place was among the best. The salmon and yellowtail sashimi was melting-fresh for a Monday night and the Angry Dragon was very clever and tasty. Add some mango and vanilla mochi and you'll be very happy. Too bad I don't get to Cleveland very often or I'd be a regular!"}
{"text":"Barely average.  My sushi rolls didn't even stay together.  Who's working in the kitchen.  However,  my dirty martini was tasty."}
{"text":"First time here...  Waitresses were awesome, Chad Man was awesome and hilarious hibachi chef.   Sushi was good, fresh.  Overall, excellent experience here."}
{"text":"Went here on a recent work trip. Place is legit. Fresh sushi (and I live in Boston) and super friendly staff. Prices are right too. Beers, seaweed salad, 3 premium rolls, and a hand roll for $50 bucks. Felt like I robbed the place.  Will definitely be back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This was the best hibachi I've ever had. The service was amazing. Our waitress had the best spirit. We just walked in. Thursday night's are the best they're not that busy. Our server was the most sincere and kept conversation. This was the best food ever. I had the salmon and fried rice."}
{"text":"Those who love Hibachi grills will love the place.  If we went on my preferences I'd give the place a lesser rating.  However, if you're looking at this review you must like teriyaki and hibachi environments.  My wife picks to go here for special date nights more than I would.  She loves it.   Great environment and family friendly.  I did enjoy their Long Island iced tea, top shelf.  Delicious drink."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Always fun for hibachi...but if you don't want to do the whole experience the bar area is nice.  GREAT sushi and the bartenders are usually very friendly.  Try an Angry Dragon roll!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go.  I have yet to have a bad experience here.  Staff is always kind and efficient.  Food is always excellent.  I would recommend you make a reservation instead of walking in, especially on the weekends if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised that no one has reviewed this place strictly for their sushi. My friend and I ordered 2 sushi and 4 maki rolls. I was really surprised at the quality, flavor and freshness. I'd recommend the sushi to anyone and would absolutely return. Ordering sushi and drinks gets expensive (pretty much anywhere you go if it's decent) so I'm giving it 4 stars because of the cost. I don't think the cost was incredibly outlandish or anything, it's just that I'm cheap.   The decor was really nice and the service was excellent as well.  Additionally, it's really easy to get to from the nearby highways and has plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Wasabi was super disappointing tonight.  The restaurant was freezing cold.  We had to wear our winter coats during dinner.  I could see my breath indoors.  The chef burned the a lot of the food tonight and filet was way over-cooked.  This place is hit or miss but the last two times we were here it was a miss.   Might be we had the same guy cook for us last couple of times...."}
{"text":"I went to this Wasabi with my coworkers for lunch one day and they did pretty good. The server we had was really nice and quick with getting everything out. I would definitely keep going back the food was nice and hot! Ohh and they definitely give you a great portion size as well."}
{"text":"It was okay.  The food was very salty.  They made us wait til all our party of four was there for lunch.  Then they tried to seat us in the back where our disabled member could not walk.  So they had to seat us on our own side.  If they would have sat us when we first got there, she could have sat on the end, so they screwed themselves on that.  Also, no one ordered drinks or sushi (which I had planned) because they made us wait up front. The hibachi chef barely said three words to anyone at the table.  He didn't do any of the fancy things you get at other places.  The waiter was also hard to get.  Two of us had to steal water from the other two because we were so thirsty.  Then in the dessert, there was something that was not food, I'm hoping it was paper.  I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes to see the waiter so we left.   I've been told its much better for dinner, which I could only hope so."}
{"text":"Hibachi meal was great. Our chef was entertaining and fun. Easily accommodated our group of 10."}
{"text":"Had reservations at another Japanese restaurant for a birthday celebration. After waiting more than 30 minutes, we left that restaurant and headed to Wasabi. What a great meal. What a great experience. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had the sushi and sashimi combo dinner.  Not only was the fish very fresh, but the portions were tremendous.  The service was very good as well.  Good background music too"}
{"text":"Recently visted this restaurant after eating at the Montrose Hibachi location. Although the food was excellent, the service was terrible. I could not get refills on my beverage to save my life. The waitress  even complained \"didn't I just bring you one of those?\" yes-15 minutes ago! ( I was only drinking iced tea). We waited forever between our appetizer and our sushi rolls and then the bill was incorrect as well. IF you go-go for the food, but don't expect much with the service."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Wasabi for many years. Each experience is different.   I always go to the hibachi section as I enjoy the meals you can get. I could live on that ginger salad dressing. It is so good. If someone knows if you can buy it, let me know!  The price tag for the amount of food you get is not bad at all. $18-$20 might seem expensive for your basic chicken, but you get so much with it. You get onion soup, a salad, noodles, veggies, steamed rice (or a heap of fried rice for $2 extra), and even some shrimp. Not to mention you can get a bunch of sake or vodka from the chef squirted into your mouth if that's your sort of thing. I like how they've started doing lemonade for the kids so they don't feel left out.   I will say that there is a lot of butter and oil used in cooking. What makes me happy about coming here is that even if I decide to do the hibachi, I can get it cooked in the back without butter or oil while still getting to watch the show.   There is one discrepancy that did occur on one of my last visits, my father took me out for my birthday last year and they put us with the other people table and automatically tacked on the 18% gratuity as you would for a party of 8. That wasn't ok. We were not a part of the larger party and we were grouped as such. I have no issues with the 18% if we were in the proper party, but there  was just 4 of us. I would be sure to check your receipt to make sure that doesn't happen.   Wasabi is a classic in my book and I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Loved the Sunrise Roll on special today. It was the best roll I have had in a long time. Nice blend of flavors."}
{"text":"Eh, it's a sushi place. It was nothing special. The staff were really nice and the sushi was fine. It just doesn't do anything to set itself apart. I can't judge much since I had a carryout dinner but it seemed busy. They had a full service bar and it's a large restaurant."}
{"text":"Come here for the Hibachi and you won't be disappointed. Our chef was GREAT!  Very fun as Hibachi should be!  Food was really good, even the sashimi. We didn't have any rolls, so can't comment on that, the sashimi was good (tuna & salmon)."}
{"text":"We opted not to do the hibachi thing,  but it certainly sounded like a crowd-pleaser,  with lots of cheering. Fortunately,  we chose the quieter side, with comfortable seating and trendy decor, and had a fabulous meal of the best sushi and sashimi we've ever had! All the fish was fresh, artfully presented,  and delicious! We each did the sushi/sashimi combo for $23, and it was a good deal for 15 pieces. Truly excellent,  check it out."}
{"text":"This place was fucking great! I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. When we arrived, we initially sat at the Hibachi section which is loud and very social--as we were in town for a funeral, it was not fitting for our mood. We made our way to the sushi side and were pleasantly surprised by the soft, quiet atmosphere that greeted us; it's like night and day from one side of the restaurant to the other. And the decor is great--love the fish tanks in the bar, the candles, and the spacing between the tables!   Our server was great. I believe his name was Corey, and it was his second day working there. He had good recommendations that we took him up on (see photos for details). Everything was fresh and delicious, and I loved my fruity drink. Corey was a really good server; attentive without lurking over us--my favorite! A good addition to this place.   What's great about Wasabi is that you can have two totally different experiences here: at the hibachi, you can be rowdy with friends and get a show; at the sushi side, you can have a more romantic, quiet evening and be able to have a good conversation with your dining companion. Best of both worlds, methinks. And the price was fitting for all elements that I consider when dining out. A+."}
{"text":"Had a crazy sushi craving so I decided to check this place out.  I decided to have dinner at the bar since I just wanted some sushi and a drink.  The bartender was super nice and helpful.  She would occassionally come and check on us to make sure we were fine and if we needed anything (it wasn't to the point of annoyance either).  Sushi was awesome and not really pricey as I thought it would be."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT ON EARTH.  Literally.  Love the shrimp hibachi.  LOVE LOVE the montrose roll (yah, white girl sushi, I know...) and also love the yum yum sauce.  I put it on EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"This is a great Teppanyaki place, good selection entreating cooks and nice portion sizes.  I had the lobster sushi roll and it was amazing (and huge)!!! Took about half my Tepan home because I was stuffed to the gills.  Surf and Turf for $34 was a flavorful tender 6oz filet mignot and a 6oz lobster tail - noodles, rice, soup and salad.  Hot sake was a medium grade which is fine by me.  My hubby ordered the hibachi sirloin off the premium menus which was essentially a double serving of steak for $6 more than the regular menu size - okay that's cool, who doesn't love double the steak?  We will be back in February for my birthday."}
{"text":"Very good food, atmosphere and service. I recommend the calamari as an appetizer and the Angry Dragon as a main course. The drinks are good. I had a Long Island ice tea and it was very good. I give this place my highest recommendation. For 3 of us it came to $130. Not bad for what we had."}
{"text":"I like Hibachi style of food and I had a nice time here. The Chefs are talented. I went with my mom and dad and we went early and got a good seat. The sushi side has amazing food as well as the side where they cook in front of you. I definitely would go back."}
{"text":"We came in absolutely starving, and boy were we happy after! I am well experienced in the world of sushi and Japanese cuisine. My boyfriend not so much. This was his second time having sushi and he loved it. I was disappointed by the calamari appetizer  specifically the sauce and how it was Cooked, it was so chewy I felt like I was eating a rubber hose. We ordered 4 different sushi rolls, the Philadelphia roll, the friends roll, tiger shogun, and spicy crab. They were all delicious! And the portion sizes were massive. The service was fast and good, our waitress was very attentive and kept our refills coming. I will definitely be returning in the very near future. I think we've found a new date spot. Also from the look of the cheesecake the table next to us ordered I'm going to have to try the dessert sometime too! Definitely a hidden gem and the prices were so amazing."}
{"text":"make sure you have patience or make a reservation- we had to wait roughly 30 mins on a weeknight.  There are definitely a couple cute waiters ;) haha.  It had some good unique rolls for the Chef's Special, but nothing fantastic.  The sashimi was quite fishy (not that it went bad) but it had a fishy taste- probably from the thick cuts of sashimi/blood.  It was 4-6 dollars for roughly 3 pieces of sashimi/ 2 pieces of sushi. :( The udon noodle soups were flavorless- just a basic chicken stock broth- with noodles, veggies, chicken and tempura shrimp.  The tempura shrimp was like any other tempura shrimp that you can get a japanese restaurant.  We tried the lobster and steak combo- the dish is terrible- WHAT A WASTE OF PERFECTLY GOOD LOBSTER.  The sauce on the steak and lobster was bland and flavorless.  Watch out for groups of 6+ the restaurant charges a 20% gratuity.  We ended up paying 50.00 in just gratuity. The waiters forgot several items that we ordered (salad, soup, and a to-go meal) It seems as if they invested more money into the decor (LED ceilings, water bubble walls, and fish pond in the entrance) than they did into the food BOTTOMLINE: save yourself some money and just go to a smaller less \"atmosphere-based\" Japanese restaurant to get better tasting food."}
{"text":"I rarely go to a sit-down chain restaurant but when I'm feeling that sense of emptiness and loss created by the passing of the old Sushi Rock Downtown (yes, the sadness is still there) I find that Wasabi perks me up.  The fish has always been fresh (a must for any sushi place, of course) and the creators of the menu know when to not mess with traditional -- the nigiri is simply the fresh seafood and rice -- and when to mix it up -- the shrimp-based Super Crunch Roll has jalapenos mixed in which mirror the kick of the standard wasabi.  The menu is quite large with all the usual cuts of seafood and there are numerous rolls combining those options. The prices are also decent -- Jeannene and I usually spend about $100 and we feel full and a little tipsy with two drinks each.  Ahhh, Tsunami Night, how I miss you.  Their appetizer list is also extensive with a lot of traditional Japanese dishes or at least inspired ones. I always go with the spicy crab salad while Jeannene goes with the seaweed salad which are both fresh and lightly seasoned.  Meanwhile, Wasabi's cocktails -- running the gamut of tropical to dessert -- always seem to be well mixed and not watered down.  We've never been on the hibachi side of the restaurant but it seems like a good place for large groups as it's usually boisterous with a lot of laughing.  One warning -- the service can get slow at times, depending on how crowded it is, so assume that you are going to have a more leisurely dinner."}
{"text":"I like the lounge like lighting and ambiance. Had their eel over rice dish. Big portion and delicious! Food was served fairly fast and the service was good."}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland for a day last month to visit the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and went to dinner that night at the Wasabi Japanese Steakhouse simply because it was convenient to our hotel. Hands down, it was one of the best restaurant meals I've ever eaten. The decor, the service, and the food were all excellent. I recommend the Wasabi Japanese Steakhouse highly to anyone in or passing through the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We were unsure but our daughters really wanted to go. We chose the Hibachi dinner experience . There were 5 in our group. We waited what we considered a long time for our experience to begin. Two additional people were seated with us. Once our chef began we were pleasantly surprised. Our meal still took a while to prepare but was very good. We had chicken, shrimp, scallops, steak and lobster.  My girls thought the fried rice was the best thing they ate. Our steak was pretty fantastic. The chef singled out one of our daughters and really made her evening!"}
{"text":"My go to for sushi on this side of town - lovely date level atmosphere and good quality rolls. Lunch special for sushi  is fab! Just tried the Super Crunch roll tonight and really liked it. It's super maki size, so big in mouth and tends to fall apart a little if you dip. Use fingers and stuff it in! Hidden heat....yay! Sat in a private room at low table as a special treat. Def cuts some of the jarring noises from bar area."}
{"text":"This is a pretty place very good for food. Though I have criticism, this place is under-staffed where there are more waiters/waitresses then the chefs. This means when people pack the place up which is usual no one can get their food unless you reserve a table or you wait an hour. This is not a professional place but I enjoyed the welcoming staff and hope that they improve."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Fresh sushi and great service. Highly recommended. Love the angry dragon roll."}
{"text":"Good food.....nice restaurant!!!!! Lots of fun...."}
{"text":"Wasabi Wednesday!!!! Our crew graced Wasabi with our presence again last week and I have to say the service was MUCH better!   The key is to go early...they start filling up after 7 and thats when the service gets a little hairy."}
{"text":"I had average expectations coming to this restaurant but was still let down. We came for the hibachi grill and first off the table was dirty and there was left over rice and sauce around the grill and on the tables.   Appetizers were great. Main course, chicken and steak with vegetables, was okay. A little too much sauce for my taste but I finished it. I think our chef was on the new side and I understand there's a learning curve but there were eggshells in the fried rice (and the rice was also crunchy for some reason). Half our vegetables ended up on the floor from missing our mouths. After the first miss I asked to pass but he kept going.  Other than that, our server was nice and kept our drinks full. I wouldn't recommend this location but the one in Independence and Fairlawn are great."}
{"text":"Arrived and wait staff said there was a 35 minute wait so we asked the mall and waited for a call returned 45 minutes later and they seated another party instead and then have the nerve to ask us to wait another 15 minutes no apology no nothing"}
{"text":"After a soccer matchup we ventured here after attempting to visit locations a couple of times but always having to wait to long. We even had Jenns sister Natalie w us.   The decor is nice and relaxing and more upscale than your normal dove sushi spots. Our server was nice and fast. He also could answer questions about the menu. We got a appetizer that was good but portioned tiny for a third world country and over priced.  A few peppers in batter and onions and two shrimp, sad for ten dollars.   We got refills fast before our glass even hit the table.  I got lobster and crab rolls. I actually liked the crab better. I think it was due to how they were cooked and the texture. The soup was also good  Jenn got a lobster roll and soba noodles w shrimp very good.   Natalie got one of the boxes w chicken which she also liked due to flavor and taste.   Overall good very good"}
{"text":"Fun for the whole family.  I love the Saki shots.  I'm ready to go again...the food was great, and the cook was quite entertaining.  Their desserts are ZEE BEST!!"}
{"text":"Had a family dinner here when I was in town and everything was great. We had a private table which created a nice atmosphere to talk and bond. The food was very good, and I eat sushi quite often. Plus, who doesn't have fun when drinking saki?"}
{"text":"In Cleveland on business from California, and had a craving for good sushi for dinner.  Read reviews, and was a bit skeptical because I really just wanted sushi, and not the hibachi experience.  As soon as I entered, the host asked me if I wanted to sit in the regular dining.  I was sat in a nice booth-backed table, and wouldn't even know there was the whole hibachi experience if I hadn't peeked in the next room while getting up to wash my hands.  The sushi was phenomenal.  I had the Angry Dragon Roll, the Red Dragon Roll, and the California Roll, as well as a few pieces of Tuna Nigiri.  The dragon rolls were excellent, and fresh.  The food came almost immediately, there was almost no waiting like in many sushi places.  I orderd the California roll as a backup just in case I needed something to fall back on, but no need, the other rolls were perfect.  I had a Japanese Pale Ale (Rising Sun) that paired really well.  I'm used to having to settle for the dry Asahi, Sapporo, or Kirin lagers, so to find a more tasty craft ale from Japan was the icing on the cake.  The ambiance is cool and modern.  I will definitely come back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"First visit to Wasabi & I greatly look forward to visiting again next time I'm in town! When we walked in we were all struck by how lovely it is.  There are koi fish in a pool in the lobby that includes a cool glass bottom floor to watch them.  It's a large interior in different sections - dining room for menu ordering, nice size bar & then a large room with several hibachi stations. We were a party of 3 & were placed with a group of 7 at a hibachi station.  One in our party didn't want hibachi & they happily allowed him to order off the main menu. The hibachi was excellent.  Very large portions & bursting with flavor.  Meal began with a salad with a very tasty ginger dressing. I had fillet mignon and added a side of scallops.  With hibachi you get delicious fried rice & chow mein noodles & veggies -- all of which is prepared in front of you - hence fresh & steaming hot.  Portions are very plentiful - you'll likely take some home.  Wasabi is very clean& service was very friendly.  I am I the area about 3 times a year & look forward to trying the main dining room next time.  Just excellent overall."}
{"text":"I understand the \"tradition\" of taking your shoes off but for the idiot hostess to say \"then you should sit at a table\" is rude. Furthermore, how about putting up a sign stating that and perhaps mentioning it upon taking your reservation. Or does that make too much sense?  The food is good."}
{"text":"Everything on the Hibachi tasted the same. The menu is way overpriced for everything to taste like grilled brown rice and sauce. No thank you for the prices but the atmosphere is fun ( That's about it)."}
{"text":"I hosted a party of 20 people here and made it clear to the servers when we arrived that I was hosting the party and to bring me the bill.   The food was OK, the \"performers\" not as skilled as I have seen elsewhere.  But it was fun.    At the end, the bill was brought, a brother and I went through it and concluded it was correct and I paid by credit card and included a substantial tip.   Then we sat for another 20  minutes or so talking.  The place had empty tables so I knew we were not keeping people from eating.  The workers were clustered at the kitchen door and kept peeking out towards me but did not come out.  When I left, about 6 of my guests were still there talking.    I only found out later what happened next.  As soon as I was gone the servers came out and told my remaining guests that they, the servers,  had failed to bill for all of the meals and (about)  $25 was still owed.  Someone had to pay before they could leave.  My 23 year old nephew paid.   I am  appalled that my guest was asked to pay because of the mistake of the servers.  They should not make such mistakes but had ample time to correct it before I left.  Plus, I am convinced that there was no mistake."}
{"text":"I ordered a bottle of sake that was listed on the menu as costing $15. The check came, and I was charged $19. I questioned it to the bartender. \"Oh, you must have been looking at a menu with the old prices.\" That was it. No action. I said, \"Well, if the menu I looked at said $15 instead of $19, I need to pay $15.\" That's when her smile fell and she went to get a supervisor.   The supervisor tweaked the bill for me with no argument and mentioned that the \"owner hasn't changed out all the menus.\"  No one goes out to dinner to expect the stress of double-checking their bill. MAKE SURE YOU DO at their place."}
{"text":"Finding myself on the road for my job yet again it was time for another round of GPS roulette. I found this place nearby my hotel and I'm never not in the mood for sushi.  The first word that hit my mind when I walked in was swanky. This place it  definitely swanky. As you walk in the front doors you cross a waterfall going into a koi pond. The host area looks like a wave cresting and the bar has a pretty bubble water installment.  My server was knowledgeable, friendly, and very attentive.  I ordered the sweet potato roll, philly roll, and spider roll. All were good with the sweet potato winning outright this night. The philly and spider could use a bit of improvement but overall I was pleased."}
{"text":"Not like it used to be cut back on the amount of food given by 75 percent and not as entertaining. It's sad to say that the soup and salad had more flavor than my entire meal. Also it's sad when a white boy is cracking jokes and cooking and the Asian guy doesn't even say a word except how you want your steak cooked."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time a few weeks ago, and have been wanting to go back ever since! I've been to plenty of other hibachi/teppan restaurants back home in southern California, but they are not even comparable to the amount of entertainment, great service, and delicious food at Wasabi!   I'll begin by talking about the entertainment. The chef we had was so much fun! He poured sake into our mouths and joked with us the entire time. As with other hibachi restaurants, he performed the onion volcano, etc.   Food: I ordered the steak and chicken combo, while my boyfriend ordered the shrimp and scallops combo. The steak was just the right amount of tenderness. The chicken was a little on the dry side, but the sauce made up for it. Both the scallops and shrimp were delicious as well! If you're allergic to seafood, don't be scared because this places cooks the meat and seafood separately :) Also, the portion size is HUGE! It seriously lasted me 2.5 meals haha   Service: very attentive servers!   I've also never seen such a large hibachi restaurant before! There were seriously like three separate rooms, 2 for hibachi and 1 for sushi. I definitely want to come back to try the sushi! I would recommend this place for birthday dinners, dates, family dinners, and pretty much every other occasion! :)"}
{"text":"The ambiance here is really zen. There's the water wall, starry ceiling, bamboo wall, and koi pond. The sushi is great. Then if you're not feeling zen the hibachi grill can be a riot. The sake flows from the hibachi chef to whomever wants it and puts on a good show. Rice with the hibachi meals is an extra $2 (I think?) and I would forgo it since you get noodles here with the meal. As a garlic fiend I never thought I'd say this but they do use too much garlic at the grill."}
{"text":"This place is delicious.  I ordered the hibachi steak and shrimp and it was very good.  I was a let down by The steak, it was over cooked and dry... Can't blame the cook the steak was thin to begin with. If you want a good piece of meat order the filet mignon, can't go wrong there.  Other than that everything else was delicious and I had a great time."}
{"text":"Exactly what you would expect from a hibachi restaurant. ..a lot of food, mediocre entertainment, and a sky high bill...good times"}
{"text":"My attention was grabbed the second I walked in. Koi fish swimming under my feet!!! That gets 2 thumbs up. Very different from most places in NE Ohio. Also I couldn't stop starring at the water wall behind the sushi bar. And the glowing little lights in the ceiling.... I could go on by lets get to what you want to know. FOOD.  I sat at the sushi bar. They have traditional tables and also a hibachi side. I can say the sushi was outstanding. Fresh tasting, explosive with flavors that mixed in your mouth. I have been to sushi places all over the country and am proud to say Cleveland has a great one.   Take the kids, the family, a first date.... Its well worth it."}
{"text":"ANGRY DRAGON SUSHI -- if you come here, do yourself a favor and order this! OH MY GOD, IT'S THE BEST THING EVER. I had it about a week ago and ever since then I have been craving it EVERY SINGLE DAY. This roll is one the best rolls I've ever had. It's full of flavor, slightly spicy but just right. We ordered a couple other rolls (don't remember names) and those were good but once you try the Angry Dragon, you really don't even want to eat anything else, nothing else compares!  They were very busy for Hibachi, but dining service was still prompt. Our waitress was very sweet and checked with us often. The atmosphere is nice and relaxing, I enjoy coming here.  Overall, a great experience, and the ANGRY DRAGON, don't forget! :)"}
{"text":"I love Hibachi style cooking and so a friend and I came here for dinner during a weekday evening. We did not have a reservation, but were seated immediately despite the traffic they had at the time. Hostesses were very friendly and accommodating to us. I loved the decor of the place, and I absolutely loved the built in fish \"tanks\" if you will when you walk in!   Sat down, drink orders were taken immediately followed by our food orders when our table was ready. We ordered 3 different sushi's (can't remember what we got exactly) and I am just started eating sushi recently so I am not in anyway prepared to judge sushi on whether it is \"good\" or not but my friend wasn't crazy about it and said it wasn't that good.   I ordered the chicken hibachi dinner. This is where I was impressed. I have eaten Hibachi at many places and they have been hit or miss. This place was a hit on every aspect of the hibachi dinner including the soup, salad, the fried rice and, the noodles. (Yes, this can all easily be bad) but where I was truly impressed is the chicken. I stopped ordering chicken for my hibachi dinners (opted for filet mignon) after constantly being let down. The chicken is usually flavorless and bland but NOT here. This is the best hibachi style chicken I ever had. It is so flavorful, I really enjoyed it. Had some left overs and couldn't wait to have it for lunch the next day. It was just as good.   I would return here again and maybe try something else as they had an extensive menu. Prices are good, the atmosphere is fun and could easily come with family or friends. It is also good for large parties."}
{"text":"I stopped in for take out and was very impressed with the restaurant and atmosphere. The food was outstanding and very fresh. I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"So here is an honest down to earth review of Wasabi...I came here for work due to proximity and happy hour but I will tell you this I have only returned because of good food, great bartenders/staff and excellent management.  I have come back to the hotel in Beachwood specifically for this restaurant.  Please give this place a try and if things are not to your liking tell them and they will make it right!"}
{"text":"The waiter very standoffish and cold. Just came to table never asked if wanted appetizer or suchi.  When we did get drinks took for ever for refill.  I ordered edemone this came out like rubber was cold horrible.  Told server all asked if wanted new one said no. That was still on my bill.  Then the salad soup came out together. Never had them come out together but ok.   Before salad was done her comes Hibachi chef.  Only two tricks or talking he did was egg trick and volcano. He blazed thru as fast as he could.   Then my daughter orders a kids portion they never bring out desert.   I tell the hostess about she says sorry have good day.  Really.  When I sat most plates were dirty had be replaced.    Horrible service from start to finish.  Food was just ok."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying I LOVE HIBACHI! Have tried many different restaurants, city's, states etc. Have tried all the different variations of yum yum sauce, saki, tricks etc. After my visit to this particular location I was highly disappointed, and not technically because of the food but because of the experience.  And let's be serious, half of the fun of Wasabi is the experience.    The one in Akron is one of my favorites and they must not of taken any of their employees in that location to train in this location because the wait staff was rude and uninformed.  I sat down with two friends of mine hoping for a fun, enjoyable meal. We were first rushed to order drinks, we asked for an opinion on cocktails and the only comment we got was, \"They are all good.\"   Then,  quickly following, we were forced to order. My friend wanted to get Sushi instead of Hibachi and our waiter proceeded to take everyone's order before even bringing her the Sushi menu! After, he left for a good 7 minutes before returning to ask her if she is ready and when she asked a question about a few of the rolls, he had NO IDEA what he was talking about.    The chef was funny, incredible, and fun just as they should be.  Let us all have saki (which is a reason why these are my favorite restaurants), made jokes, did all the tricks, and even gave me my double yum yum.  The bad followed again by the staff while we were still eating and MY FORK WAS IN MY HAND and the bus boy came by, asked if I was done and took away my plate without a response.   I really would totally excuse this behavior if it was extremely busy and they were trying to turn over tables fast, but the place was empty and there was no reason to feel so rushed in and out.  While all of my complaints are not about the food, as it tasted pretty par for the course, I would chose to come out to Beachwood or Akron just to avoid the staff."}
{"text":"We hit this place 3? times in 7 days because options in the area were severely limited when focused on food being healthy and tasty.  Sashimi was decent at times, pretty tasty on others, mostly dependent on the fish and probably how fresh it was."}
{"text":"Bin etwas hin und her gerissen, was ich schreiben soll. Aber von Anfang an. Man kann zwischen Hibachi dining (man sitzt um eine heisse Platte und der Koch br√§t vor einem das Steak) und traditional dining room (man sitzt am Tisch und w√§hlt ein Tellergericht aus) w√§hlen. Wir haben uns f√ºr das Traditionelle entschieden.  Als Vorspeise teilten wir uns ein Maki. Die Bedienung empfahl uns die Autumn Roll (Krebs, Spargel, Lachs, Avocado mit einer scharfen Sauce). Das Maki war sehr lecker und die Portion kann man sich gut teilen. Als ich mir gerade ein Maki in den Mund steckte, kam die Bedienung wieder um uns zu fragen, ob wir schon unseren Hauptgang gew√§hlt haben. Sehr unpassend!  Zu jeden Hauptgang bekommt man Suppe und Salat. Das kam dann auch schon, w√§hrend wir noch beim Maki waren und da der Tisch nicht besonders gro√ü war, wurde es etwas schwierig. Geschmeckt hat beides gut. Als Hauptgang hatte ich Yaki Udon (dicke Nudeln mit H√§hnchen und Gem√ºse, man kann es auch mit Sobanudeln haben) und er hat mir sehr geschmeckt.  Meine bessere H√§lfte hatte Filet Mignon Teriyak. Das Fleisch war sehr zart, die Zwiebeln lecker, das Gem√ºse bissfest und nur lauwarm. Zusammenfassend kann man sagen, dass das Essen lecker war, der Service nicht besonders gut."}
{"text":"I came here with my beloved and we were very excited to get a nice sushi sashimi dinner Joel was our waiter and rocked  We had the wasabi roll and Angel roll Awesome  Time to go"}
{"text":"We went in to eat hibachi and there was hardly anyone in the restaurant.  They stated that they might be able to get us in at first, then said they could.  We waited and waited and watched them do nothing.  It really seemed like they didn't want to serve us, or care.  We were more of a bother.  We decided to leave after 25 minutes on nothing."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of girls and sat at the hibachi area. Even if we had reservations made, it didn't help because we all still had to wait 1/2 hour for our spot. It was a Friday night and we got there at 8:30 and didn't get seated until around 9 or so. I guess this is the typical wait especially on a busy night like this. However, when we got seated, we got service quick. Our server Kristyn was very attentive and seemed like she has been there for awhile so she knew what she was doing.   I split the Nigori (cold) sake and for the price for $10, it's not bad. For dinner, some of the girls ordered the hibachi combos chicken and steak, surf and turf, and I just got sushi. Looking over their menu, they do offer quite a variety of items: sushi, appetizers, soups, noodles, katsu, etc. Their hibachi dinners come with soup and salad, lo mein noodles, rice (white or fried) so it's a good deal with the dinner. The portions were very large so everyone had a doggie bag. For sushi, I ordered their eel, sweet shrimp, and green dragon roll. The green dragon had shrimp tempura, avocado and cucumber. It was good however I felt it was already made before my friends' dinners were served, so it was cold. The sweet shrimp was a bit disappointing because it looked like the shrimp sat out for awhile. The eel however was good.    Here were the cons: The steak request was not promised from the chef. Medium rare is not medium well. That is one of my pet peeves when you're asked for how you like your steak then comes out not looking what you had asked. You might as well not ask if you're going to make it the way you want. Like any typical hibachi place, the chef does his tricks and also shoot sake in your mouth but if you say no, it's no. I think it's plain rude to blatantly shoot sake in a girls mouth when she has a drink in her hand.   Overall, I think it was just A-OK for the foods we ordered. Service was excellent so kudos to the servers. This is a chain so I didn't expect very much but I guess I had high hopes because all the other locations Fairlawn and Orange I have been to were exceptional."}
{"text":"Made reservations 4 days in advance, no problem getting seating for 5 on Hibachi side of the restaurant.  Front desk staff were very friendly and courteous.  Got nice corner seating, and didn't have to sit next to another group for a change.  Hibachi chef was very friendly and funny, having us catch food in our mouth, entertaining our son with some flames on the grill and other tricks.  The food was incredible, from the scallops, shrimp, steak, noodles, fried rice and chicken all the way to the ginger salad they start you out with.  Absolutely fantastic.  Our mother and father had never been and they thoroughly enjoyed the food and hospitality.  Our waitress was very friendly as well and checked on us several times.  Excellent, 5-stars!"}
{"text":"The best meal I have had in weeks.  Service was perfect.  Sushi was great. Meal was great.  Restaurant was clean and comfortable.  Short wait time. Drink had the perfect favor server was attentive and fast and was about to answer all of questions and was very personable.  I rarely give 5 stars but they surely deserve it.  I will be returning with a group for sure."}
{"text":"Too much garlic in everything. It overwhelmed the fried rice, shrimp and scallops. The seafood ceviche was good. The lobster was good too. The scallops were over cooked on one side and the egg in the fried rice was burned. We went to a different Wasabi and it was much better than this one. The price for this food was not worth the quality of what we were served."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place to go in Cleveland! They have the best food and their cooks are so friendly. I have been here a lot and they have been amazing each time. Their sushi is also really good! I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Ok this was enjoyable. Price slightly steep at ($46 for lunch). Now for my first experience; let's get started:  1. I ordered two Sushi rolls; A Spider Maki and a Spicy crab roll.  Both of these rolls were EXCEPTIONAL. honestly from the presentation (Should have taken a picture) to the freshness of the fish and taste. Two of my favorite rolls and they were stunning. I will be back for the sushi and soon!  2. Whenever at a sushi bar I never ever order anything outside of sushi; except today. Today I ventured into the kitchen because their beef teriyaki dishes sounded exquisite. You could select from varied cuts of beef such as flank, strip, Filet. I went with the Sirloin Steak Teriyaki (They also have seafood selections for Teriyaki).   How was it? Well I included a photo; the presentation was outstanding and the steak was cooked medium. Under the 'bed' of evenly sliced beef I found beautiful caramelized onions sitting in a river of sweet yet tangy Teriyaki sauce.  I added my steamed sticky rice which also had a great texture and dug in.  Now don't get me wrong it was good (and watch out it is really hot) but for some reason the flavors didn't wake up. While the dish looked great and the presentation was appealing the lack of eye opening flavor left me slightly deflated.  In closing I will be back for sure. The atmosphere is really nice and they have private dinning rooms where you sit on the floor Japanese style that would be great for a date or a group of close friends.  I will likely stick with the sushi on future visits unless I venture over to the Hibatchi side (Which also looked exciting)."}
{"text":"LOVE Wasabi. It is right across the street from my work, which makes it very convenient and my co workers and I come here often!!  They have a lunch hibachi which you can't beat for the price and portion size-- who doesn't love a good hibachi for lunch? Everything is always delicious and I have never had a negative experience.  For a quicker option, I love getting their sushi for lunch ( Montrose roll is heavenly) and they offer a lunch special for sushi where you can get 3 different types of rolls for $9 (usually $5 each.) Cant beat it and quality is great!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are fantastic and cheap! They also give you a salad with a delicious ginger dressing! We visit here quite frequently for lunch. The service is friendly and quick so you won't be late for returning to work"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always fun and a great time. We have came here for our holiday party multiple times and loved it. Great staff and cook. We got our own private room this last time and loved it. I love watching him cook the food in front of us. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch with coworkers a few times. The quality of the teppanmaki is okay, but if you get one of the shrimp options with chicken or steak, you get only 3 shrimp, and that's pretty weak. Also, we were only a group of 5, and a 18% gratuity was automatically added to our bill, and that was really lame. Then they had the nerve to ask for additional gratuity on the bill.  The guy doing the hibachi was pretty disingenuine, and just went through the motions of the entertainment portion.  I would have given one star, but the actual quality of my hibachi meal was okay, and the small salad with ginger dressing is actually pretty good. The steak is good but pretty small."}
{"text":"We've loved and enjoyed wasabi on a quarterly basis for years, but it's slowly turned into a pigsty. When parking you'd think it's closed with weeds sprouting everywhere and rust on all the signs. There's a dirty towel stuck in one of the glass doors of the entrance, the koi pond is green from algae scum and drain flies are everywhere. We were the first diners of the evening yet the women's restroom was dirty with toilet paper on the ground and it reeked of methane gas. For heavens sake, don't look at the fake plants dividing the seating areas and bar. They're covered with dust and webs reach the ceiling. If they don't even care about the cleanliness of the dining area, where customers are supposed to enjoy a relaxing atmosphere, I shudder to think about what the kitchen is like.  The staff is average at best. We were there for over an hour and our waters were never refilled, but the smiles were somewhat genuine.  It only receives two stars because the sushi is fantastic, but unfortunately we will not return."}
{"text":"Definitely a cool place to have good sushi and drinks. Atmosphere is cool and inviting. Never done the hibachi only sushi bar. Definitely worth the $$$."}
{"text":"I had high hopes. I went in with a party of 12 for a b-day. I arrived early. It took a good 15 minutes for them to clear out the previous party. Next, I'm usually cold but all the tables were booked and it was uncomfortably hot. There was no ventilation or cool breeze to speak of. I felt trapped and suffocated through the smokey room. My contacts were giving me problems as well due to this environment. What a way to start my dinner. Then it was very loud with people getting squirted in the mouth with saki and everyone is shouting. I ordered an caramel apple martini which was tasty and helped calm me down a tad. I get my chicken hibachi and...it was dry. I was so upset, I thought I'd be chewing into juicy succulence like I make myself at home but not so much. Very chewy and dry so I had to dunk it in the sauce every time. Luckily, they gave me a couple shrimp from the excess which tasted pretty good. The prices were way too high but I guess you are paying for the experience as well. This is not the type of environment for me and I didn't think it was worth the 30 dollars for chicken and rice and a martini. I'd take a squirt of some vodka though instead."}
{"text":"One of my friends treated me to lunch at Wasabi on Thursday -- my first time at the restaurant. The waterfall and cool lighting on/behind the bar added to the sleek ambiance of the place. We were seated at a table with a grille and, understandably, had to wait for others to show up before the Chef cooked. The waiter was nice but seemed rushed, nervous, and not really sure of the menu (he told me the wrong number of shrimp that came with the steak and shrimp selection...had he told me the actual amount, I would have gone ahead and ordered an additional side order of shrimp!) A party of 6 sat down at our table - 3 adults and 3 kids. My friend and I ended up talking to the little children more than the adults because they were all busy/distracted on their phones/electronic devices!  How sad for the kids!  How ridiculous the adults looked!  One of the girls was turning 5 in a few days and the Chef did absolutely NOTHING special to acknowledge that or to make her/us laugh. Although this was my first time at Wasabi in Independence, I have frequented Japanese restaurants in Ohio, Mississippi, and Arizona and all of my other experiences included awesome chefs with great personalities who really were fabulous cooks and entertainers (a part of the enjoyment/reason for choosing a restaurant like Wasabi).  Our Chef served me the steak part of my steak and shrimp order before he served my friend -- giving me her medium-well steak (while the other steak remained on the grille because I ordered it well-done).  I transferred the steak over to her plate and waited for mine to finish grilling. When the other 6 people in the other party got their food, they didn't eat it!  They asked for to-go containers for everything!  Overall, the food was fantastic but the mediocre staff and the cellphone-distracted other guests detracted from the overall experience."}
{"text":"First visit to this restaurant as an invite to a birthday dinner. Reservations were made 24 hours in advance. We were FINALLY seated 30 minutes after our reserved time to only wait an additional 20 minutes for them to take the tables drink order. Oh and did I mention that they didn't have the back room available, it would have been an additional 45 minutes, so our party was split up. Who separates a birthday celebration??? I haven't spoken on the actual meal because we're STILL waiting to order! I gave it 2 stars because the restaurant is clean and the bar service was good"}
{"text":"First time here gone to try out  there sushi. Today was there half off on maki sushi. Order my first round of sushi round 6:30 then I was finish wanted to order my second round and they charged me regular price which I didn't know about until I got my bill. The waitress never told me about the price change. A lot of place waiter would come over and ask time is about up on half price and order everything right away. Some place you get in before the half price your going get the price.....I Just HATE seeing surprise on my bill and it took a long time on my sushi too... Sushi is not worth the regular price taste. If I knew wasn't half price sushi I would tried some else on the menu... Warning people get all ur sushi in b4 7 if not ur going see surprise on the bill!!! Just left a bad taste in my mouth"}
{"text":"Not great, not bad, just average.  The sushi rolls were smaller in size than what you usually get in a place like this. The flavor was mediocre in some cases average in others.  The dressing on the salad was extremely heavy which is unusual for a ginger dressing and had all the appearance of being from a bottle rather than made fresh in the restaurant.  The nigiri was okay but not great The pieces were a little bit small but fresh.  It's about as good as a sushi fix as you're going to get in this area.  One very important saving grace is the prompt friendly attentive service that you receive here."}
{"text":"My favorite hibachi restaurant. There are several in the area but I think you get the most for your money here. I at least have lunch the next day with the amount of leftovers I take home. The shrimp is my favorite and you can't have the shrimp without the yum yum sauce."}
{"text":"for the price of those dinners at least the bathrooms could be clean i like the food yes and probably go once a year - but dang every time i go the bathrooms are disgusting"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty stuff.   Whether it was take-out or dine-in it was tasty.  Loved the grilled octopus."}
{"text":"Great food & good service.  I love the Hibachi."}
{"text":"Great sushi. This place was packed on a Monday and I can see why. Amazing sushi. I was traveling for work and wanted a quick relaxing dinner. The full service bar was perfect. It has a relaxing waterfall. Service was good and food was wonderful."}
{"text":"A lot of hibachi places you go to nowadays seems like the chefs are just going through the motions. But not here, oh no sir!   First off, the ambiance is very classy, and the hibachi tables are larger, and more comfortable to sit at than others.   Second: while you place the order, the chefs must be in the back room doing like a pound of blow before coming out and cooking. They are nuts! Spining things, throwing things, slicing, dicing, flipping food into your mouth and setting everything on fire. They are great at their showmanship!   Third: They have squirt bottles of sake that they shoot into your mouth for as long as you can take it! AWESOME!   The food itself was excellent, but as said in previous reviews, don't plan on doing anything afterwards, you'll be so full that you are down for the count."}
{"text":"I got a combination sushi roll! Adra was very helpful in getting me exactly what I wanted in my sushi roll! It was different and but it was good!"}
{"text":"Very good I love hibachi and I have def been to many def Japanese steakhouses...this is def one the best they give you nice portions the food was very good and I had tempura calamari for my appetizer def tasty! This was the first places I've been that gave noodles and rice with the hibachi dinner so def a plus in my eye...I will def be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I recently was here for my boyfriend's grandmother's birthday dinner. We had a group of 15 for the hibachi. Apparently they do not seat you until the ENTIRE group is there. And I mean, entire. Like, one person went to use the restroom and they wouldn't seat us until we were all standing there, which was weird. I mean, I get it, because you're often seated with other parties, but there was still something vaguely off-putting about it. However, once we were all seated, the service was very good. Our waiter and waitress were extremely patient, answering all kinds of questions about the menu. Our hibachi chef was awesome, and overall the food was good. The salad they give you with the hibachi left a lot to be desired, basically it was a bowl of soggy lettuce (or in my instance, soggy lettuce and three stems, which I picked out) and sad little tomato, and the soup was kind of ho-hum, essentially a bowl of broth with a few scallions and one little slice of mushroom. The entree--the shrimp hibachi I ordered was excellent, there was so much leftover that I had a generous lunch the next day and I loved that they gave you an extra container of the yum-yum sauce to take home. I'm curious about their sushi and wouldn't mind coming back again to try that, as I think hibachi, while fun, is not really my thing."}
{"text":"Amazing service... The angry dragon roll is awesome but comes with way too much sauce, which is a little too much in large quantities."}
{"text":"Think Benihana for lunch ... at lower prices but the same, or better, bang up  show and food.  Was not planing on eating, or liking, this place, but did and do.    Sushi looked good as well."}
{"text":"First time at this particular Japanese Steak House, last night. Was there with a birthday party, which turned into two, another group joined us at our hibachi grill seating area. It makes it more fun sometimes. Got our drink order pretty fast. Gave us some social time. Came back and got our dinner options out the way. Very intuitive waiter we had.   Now, on to our chef for the night. The chef was good and very entertaining, never been to a hibachi when they shoot sake into your mouth as part of the show, that alone made it fun to watch the chef in action. Chef was spot on with his art of hibachi. The only thing from chefs stand point that I missed was the veggie  toss,but I guess that's what you get when you get the \"Sake Chef\"...lol.    The meats were cooked to perfection. The portions are amazing. Had to take most of the dinner home. Service was spot on, they include a gratuity if there's a large group sat upon with you. I really have no complaints.   We were there for my buddy's birthday, which was announced to the service team. They treat the birthday parties well. At the end of the dinner, your server comes back to the table with ice cream for your birthday w/a sparkler lit. Then the server proceeds to sing happy birthday with a gong in between verses, so over all the server is part of the entertainment as well.   Wife and I will be back for at least a second time, in the future.  Pricing was pretty typical of the style of restaurant you walk into."}
{"text":"My bf and I stayed at the hotel close by, so we went there for dinner. I ordered Deluxe sashimi and they were really fresh with a good portion (I couldn't finish). I also drank a lot of water and they were filled quite quickly. I would, however, recommend the waiter not  to clean the desk or window when the customers were eating.. It was right next to my table and I could smell nothing but the fabreeze-like smell.... Other than that everything is great. Good food, good atmosphere.. good for couples since it's dark :P oh and not many people were there when we went."}
{"text":"I've been here for hibachi a couple times before and it's always very good. Last night I decided to try something different..so I went with sushi and the gyoza app. The gyoza was very, very good! I had the California roll and added the spicy sauce. I'm just starting to get into sushi, I had tried it once before and couldn't do it..so I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed and ate all but one of the rolls! So, if you're trying to get into sushi this would be a good place to start. I also had tried a bite of the pan seared tuna app and it was also good! Very mild..also a good place to start if you're trying to expand your taste buds and venture into the world of raw fish!"}
{"text":"Haven't had the food yet, so I might revise this.  Service was sub-par.  Tried to sit at the bar, place a take order and have a drink while I waited.  The less than cordial response from the bar tender was, \"place the order with the hostess\".  That's fine, no tip for you.  Waited for the hostess, who was on the phone taking another order.  Someone else asks me if I'm being helped and I tell them I'm waiting to place a take out order, at which point another round of \"it's not my job,\" ensues.  I don't need to be waited on hand and foot, but this treatment really turned me off.  Hope the food is better than the service."}
{"text":"Very clean establishment!!! I had filet mignon and shrimp  and couple drinks bill was $60.00. Portion size was very large. It's your typical hibachi grill but very clean.  Yum yum sauce was good. Sake shots for everyone at the table nice touch. Fun night."}
{"text":"I enjoyed dinner at Wasabi while visiting the Cleveland fam.  you get the usual hibachi tricks - flipping food at you to catch it, onion volcano, and so on. unfortunately, my uncle decided to throw a piece of broccoli back at our cook, which seemed to annoy him and he stopped doing tricks. this is why we can't take him anywhere.  my cousins seated on the other side had a guy who did tons of tricks. plus, our guy was really heavy-handed with the sodium/soy sauce; the other guy used various other sauces.  my chicken was good, but the steak was better.  consensus in our group was that we all wished they had told us ahead of time about the fried rice. we didn't mind that it costs a little extra - it's good fried rice - but that you're going to get that IN ADDITION to noodles. and they don't skimp on the portions, so you get a metric ton of starch sitting on your plate."}
{"text":"Once you enter past the spray paint sign and mismatched letters the food was ok. I ate on a Wednesday night around 7. There were about 5 other people in the restaurant. I wanted sushi but was nervous based off other reviews. I sat in front of the sushi at the bar. It all looked ok  I order salmon because I figured it's popular so probably freshest. It tasted normal, good choice. I ordered the chicken and steak hibachi. Chicken and rice were pretty salty. Beef was good.   Not bad. But not great."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a Saturday night dinner here with my guy. Dinner time rush was about 5:30p and the wait time was 30 mins so we grabbed seats at the bar to wait with our pager. It was less than 10 mins and we were seated with another party of 8. Our hibachi cook, Tony, was awesome and the group we were seated with was pleasant to dine with. The saki flowed, Tony did a great presentation and all the food was delicious and well-seasoned. I think your opinion of this restaurant will depend on your cook, the other guests you are seated to dine with and your level of comfort to just enjoy a good time. Other tables were not as \"fun\" (read loud) as ours and were disappointed with their cook. I agree though, if my cook did not try to show some enthusiasm and effort to make a good hibachi presentation I'd be sour faced too. I'll definitely be back and do recommend this spot for casual dining."}
{"text":"Great place our service and food was very good. Only thing is their ventilation is weak so you will smell like a kitchen after"}
{"text":"Not the service I'm used to at wasabi. It took 15 to 20 minutes before we got our drinks. A person was mopping the floor around us so it smelled like dirty mop water. If you have to mop around customers at least use new water. The guy leaned the mop stick on the chair next to me and it slid and fell on me. That's when I started to get mad. Our waitress had a confrontation with a customer. It was not our waitresses fault. The food was good but our chef was not as charismatic at were used to at wasabi. After we got our food our experience improved. I love wasabi but will probably not go to this location again. I will probably go to the rockside road location. The best wasabi is the montrose/fairlawn location"}
{"text":"The service was wonderful and fast. The food was immediately serviced and the waitress checked on us frequently. The food was great, especially the wasabi and super crunch roll. Smooth music was playing with great decor. For a Friday night, we enjoyed a pleasant meal."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times in the past few weeks. I've eaten at the bar, as I do when traveling for business.  Service has been good. Happy hour specials are decent.  Sushi has been great at times, but then not so great.  The clientele brings this place down. Boisterous bravado and profanity abounds. Maybe it's better in the dining room, though I heard a herd of women waiting for a table in the lobby that almost shook the place. I heard no please and thank you - just ordering the staff around. I abhor profanity, and it comes at a rapid fire pace from the patrons.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love habachi! Tonight was my first time trying Wasabi for a good friend's birthday. The food was amazing! The server was efficient and never let our glasses get 1/3 empty. The chef was very skilled but very foul mouthed. He must've only had sex on his mind because even having 4 young children at the table did NOT deter him from making numerous inappropriate, sexual innuendoes right in their presence. He didn't quite get the hint when no one laughed but instead made a comment about it being a \"tough crowd\" and then followed it with a swear word. Telling the birthday girl in front of her children and husband that \"even though they just met, she can still blow\" left my mouth on the floor. There were many more tasteless jokes that I will spare you from. If you plan on going here, think twice about going as a family with children. I know I won't be taking my kids there."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this place and the sushi was amazing...the hibachi...a little bland.    I know people will laugh but the lunch portions were huge...way too much food.  The amount of food I received could have fed 3-4 people (the right portion) for two days.  Great value but not healthy portions.  I'll be back for the Sushi for sure.  Worth the drive!!!!"}
{"text":"Big ASS buffet I tell you!!!! It has EVERYTHING!!!  Even Habachi!!! Your selections are everything from a REALLY robust salad bar to bbq everything! LOTS of chinese? food from tempura to General Tso's! and seafood, sushi  Ice cream and on and on and on!!!!! Don't expect REALLY high end offerings but do expect great service very good food and downright inexpensive pricing!!!! Eat up kids!!!!"}
{"text":"Here now. Told 40 minutes. Been here an hour. Watched multiple parties of similar size be seated. They are a hot mess."}
{"text":"The Sushi here was delicious.  I had the crunchy  shrimp roll.  It was amazing.  I would definitely go back here the next time I am in town.  They have a hibachi side but I sat on the sushi side and my order came out very promptly."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch for my department's holiday party and I must say we were all very pleased! The decor is clean and nice, and the staff friendly, but the star here is the hibachi! For lunch they give you a little house salad and for the main entree (I chose steak and chicken) they cook it up in front of you with tons of rice, noodles (yes noodles too!), veggies and meat. I especially liked Wasabi because they cook with plenty of butter and garlic which smells and tastes amazing. At other habachi places they over do it on the salt and soy sauce, but not here! I ended up leaving with a full box of leftovers which is always nice. It did seem really loud inside though, a little hard to hear others on the other side of the table, but if you just nod your head and smile, that usually works. The only real downside for me was that they don't give you fortune cookies after your meal and instead they have this weird flavored gum you can snag on your way out.   All in all, I'd recommend!"}
{"text":"Solid place to go, decent happy hour. Good atmosphere. Good if you are in the area at happy hour time. Otherwise, can get better elsewhere for the same price."}
{"text":"Sushi is okay. Atmosphere is dark and weird. Above all, the girls who work at the hostess station need a set dress code. They were wearing some very inappropriate attire for anyone working customer service much less around food."}
{"text":"Now I loved this place we were there for a friend's birthday.  This was my first time , the cook was freaking hilarious the place was beautiful the food was amazing! !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Before going to the restaurant, i called to get some information. The hostess was very kind, patient, and answered all of my questions. I didnt feel rushed at all. She was great. We had dinner on 10/10. The food was amazing. They allow you to get the half off sushi specials when you're at a hibachi table. Our servers name was Korea. She tended to be a little absent when we needed something, but the other servers were able to get us what we need. Where we were seated, there was grease and some rice. No big deal. I asked Korea for a rag to clean it up. I assumed she would wipe it for us, but instead just handed me the rag to do it myself. For as pricy as hibachi can be, I would expect a little higher level of service. When we received the bill, she printed out an inaccurate receipt. I gave her my card and when she dropped it back off I noticed I was charged for about $10 more. I couldn't find her to find out what was going on. I had to ask another server to find her. There were only two other tables in the place. When she came over, she acted like it was no big deal that I was charged more than the receipt. I do not mind paying for what I receive, but I would appreciate accuracy when I get my bill.  I ordered the wasabi special which included lobster, scallops, steak, and shrimp. It was amazing. I was a little shocked to realize that there was a $2 up charge for fried rice. All it consisted of was soy and an egg. When taking my order, Korea simply asked if we wanted steamed or fried; she neglected to mention the upcharge.  We ordered sushi to share while we were waiting for our hibachi. The sushi was very fresh. Korea only brought one saucer for the soy sauce which is very inconvenient. She also didn't leave the soy sauce for us to fill as we needed to. I had to ask another server for an additional saucer. The star of the night was our hibachi chef Mario. He is amazing. What he lacks in age he makes up for with personality. I would definitely recommend requesting him. I will return for him and the seafood. I like my steak extra rare, and he was able to execute it perfectly."}
{"text":"Great sushi and great atmosphere. The restaurant is always clean and inviting and the sushi is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner with family tonight, and had an overall positive experience! We were told we couldn't make a reservation before 6:15--arrived around 6 and didn't get seated until around 6:20. Then we sat down and for probably 20 minutes no one came. No one took drink orders, food orders, brought us water etc. It was packed, but 20 minutes was a bit unacceptable. A waiter finally came over to take our drink order, and the service was relatively fast after that.   Got the scallops, and they were perfectly cooked, and you got a ton of food for the price. I definitely think that for the experience, quality and quantity of food, it was worth the price. I have definitely been to other hibachi restaurants that did more tricks, but our chef was nice and the food was great."}
{"text":"Jest went here today very busy place but we were seated immediately. When they brought out our drinks the glasses was dirty had to sent it back 3 times how ever our sushi was good and me and my wife ordered the seafood trio it was great. All in all good place jest very busy."}
{"text":"Cheap quick Habachi. Not a huge fan of Hans hi but it has a solid 4 Star. I thought it was a little dirty for my taste."}
{"text":"Got the sushi maki lunch combo for carry out.  It came with the standard green salad and a nice ginger dressing. It was very light as in not mayo thick like some.  I like this kind better.  The lunch was quite a deal 9$ for 3 very nice sized rolls. There was quite a bit of fish and the rolls were not over \"riced\".  The fish was pretty fresh. They used whole pieces of fish in the spicy rolls so it did not have the consistency or flavor of f chum. Yup these rolls were chum free.    They gave me little plastic cups, soy, chop sticks, plastic-ware, and plenty of napkins.  The little Wasabi carryout bag even had a cardboard cut out so the bag was balanced.  This will definitely be a go to carry out or quick lunch at the sushi bar!  I was quite impressed, lets see if they can duplicate that for me again!"}
{"text":"Very chic, modern decor mixed with some asian decor. The entrance has you walking over a koi pond, which was pretty cool. The inside had a lot of blue accent lighting, which was unexpected and kind of made for a futuristic nightclub vibe. The actual dining area (not hibachi) was more elegant than expected. Upholstered and cushioned seating and white tablecloths made for a nice dining experience. I believe they also had a private room for parties that had traditional Japanese floor seating and a low table.  Service is OK if not a little slow and unattentive. The bartender seemed unaware that we even existed when we sat at the bar to grab a drink while we waited for our party. Our server was OK, but the food took forever to come out, and they weren't even busy.  I can't comment on the hibachi since our party only went for sushi. Their specialty rolls are pretty crazy, and the designs are even crazier. All of the rolls we tried in our party were pretty good but there was nothing that stood out. Nothing that made you stop and say, WE HAVE TO GO HERE AGAIN. And I can't in good conscience get sushi here when Pacific East is just minutes away.  tl;dr - enter the set of TRON: Legacy, eat sushi that was designed by Ed Hardy."}
{"text":"Stayed near Wasabi and ordered takeout several times. Never dined-in but the bar service was great with comfortable atmosphere - even free Japanese tea while you wait! To sushi and seaweed salad was great and fast; you may have to remind them if you're still waiting after 15min.  However, I was a little disappointed that the prices between menus varied (i.e., price in food menus was different than drink menu) only noticing when being billed. After asking about the price difference I was pointed to an asterisk on the bottom of the page that the price maybe different than listed. Recommend asking twice if you're price conscious."}
{"text":"We went to Japan this Spring - and this place is one of the closest 'Authentic Japanese'  places we've found in Cleveland.  A+ Salmon in all its sushi'esque forms, amazing Beef Tartar (Filet Mignon super rare with Ponzu sauce-  Amazing!) - and the entry level basic sushi lunch entrees are delicious.  Portions are slightly on the smaller side- but that's because in this case you're paying for Quality of Quantity.  Havnt done their Happy Hour Yet, but i believe they have discounted appetizer and drink specials from 4-6.   Service is always fast, and its a great place to impress people without breaking the bank.  Great Miso as well."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere.  Huge hibachi area as well as regular dining section as well.  I tried both the spicy tuna maki roll and the salmon hibachi dinner.  On tuesdays from 5-7 pm the maki rolls are half off.  The hibachi dinner includes onion soup, ginger salad, 3 shrimp, rice and noodles.  I enjoyed the entire meal.  It's not the best hibachi meal I've ever had but it did not disappoint me and its a fun dining experience. This place is ideal for groups or second dates."}
{"text":"This review is about the sushi side, not the hibachi side.  If you are a die hard sushi fan then come here and order the angry dragon. We have been coming here for years and I can't believe I've never written a review. I should slap myself for that! The angry dragon roll is big enough to fill you up along with a glass of wine (or two depending on how your day went.)  They have a happy hour from 4pm-7pm but the happy hour menu changes everyday. Some days it's happy hours on drinks the other it's on sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable! Service and food were both good. We went around 1pm on a Sunday. Will defiantly return."}
{"text":"Visiting this place from Las Vegas and my overall review is \"all-right\". We were a party of 7 and had to wait almost 30 minutes for a table. It wasn't busy at all, so that just makes it irritating. Once seated we were promptly helped. Service was above expectations only to find out it was our servers first day! She did a great job! I'd have to agree with a previous review that the food is salty. If you don't like salt you may want to discuss this ahead of time. The portions were huge and I definitely did not leave hungry. The sirloin was great and flavorful. The chicken on the other hand was a disappointment as it was tough and just blah. My group secretly told them it was my birthday and so I was surprised at the end with a bowl of ice cream. This truly was delicious! I would almost come here for the ice cream alone.   I deducted one star for the rather long wait that was unwarranted. I deducted an additional star for the salty taste and disappointing chicken. If I could do 3.5 I would have."}
{"text":"Wow.  This place has really gone downhill.  They have become very strict on minor changes.  The prices are high for the area and they're suffering from bad business practices.  Sometimes a great idea doesn't get executed properly. They serve sushi on the edge of old.  You have to be careful.  I know there are not many options in Elyria for Sushi but In would avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a few years. My wife and I used to go all here all the time for sushi and it was always very good.  Somehow we both had a taste for sushi tonight and decided to try Wasabi once again. We were pleasantly surprised! The sushi is just as good as it ever was!  Sorry, can't comment on the hibachi experience. We only go here for the sushi."}
{"text":"All I can say is it was AMAZING!!! First time ever here, first time ever at a habachi grill and it was worth it. We ordered the steak and chicken combo. Got so much food couldn't finish it all."}
{"text":"Seems to be very popular especially with business travellers. Tried their sushi and it was very good. I will stop by again later to try their habachi. Good atmosphere for a romantic dinner or group meeting. Gets very busy."}
{"text":"Born and raised in suburban Cleveland, this is my favorite place to eat when I visit home. Place is  clean and the staff is very professional. My family and I enjoy the hibachi chefs and all of the entertainment. The food is soo good. I always get the triple combo (steak, chicken, and shrimp). They also give you fried rice, noodles, etc. It's alot of food so come hungry! Definitely a great place to bring your family, co-workers, or a date."}
{"text":"I heard of Wasabi but never really stopped in until \"that day\".  I cant forget it, especially because i like to frequent the establishment...Walking in you get a sense of Nuvo Japan.  Fish swimming underneath you, cool tones, architecture, walls, lighting, & not to mention bubbles.  Being inside elicits a high class feeling, though dress may be casual.    So far weve just done the sushi side but let me tell you the sushi is exquisite.  Fresh fish, veggies, and masterful artwork presented to ultimately be consumed as \"Sushi\".  Yea, I would say, its a bit of a guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Very nice atmosphere, nice bar and the \"Red Dragon\" is delicious!  I also had white tuna sushimi, I really like it."}
{"text":"Don't miss this sushi stop!  Consistent, fresh, good service and atmosphere.  Never let's me down. I've been to the Pacific East, all the Sushi Rocks - don't bother, just go to Wasabi!  Sushi Rock serves grocery store grade sushi.  Ps. I am not a hibachi customer, but a sushi one (results may vary.)"}
{"text":"Good food overall, wished the gyoza was steamed vs fried, seaweed salad was good but weird 3 pieces of spinach in it, rolls were good"}
{"text":"Typical hibachi, japanese steakhouse. Flipping eggs and making your fish last etc etc. Go to have a show put on, go to watch them make your meal, kinda place where you tell them you're allergic to fish but one person wants fish and they're pleased to oblige.  You get chicken or steak or shrimp or scallions or a combo. Comes with ginger salad, a very unobtrusive soup, rice, noodles, stir fry veggies. And/or get sushi. Amazing sushi menu.  The place itself, amazing ambiance. The bar has this water wall that's just so freaking cool. Bamboo walls and other features make it feel very modern.   Our cook squirted saki in our mouths, we asked for the 'good' one and got a lot of all night. Made sure to tip him a $20 for that.  Perfect place for 12+ friends to celebrate a birthday."}
{"text":"I come here for a quick fix for sushi for 4, 5 years now. It is one of those \"if you know what to order, you'll walk away satisfied\" place. And that is...  - Maki Dinner for Two:  You pick 2 from the Special Maki (red dragon, green dragon, spider etc the \"big\" maki. I often get \"rainbow\" because you get 4 types of fish, and they're right there on the top without sauce and tempura. There's no hiding if it's not fresh.)   And pick another 2 from the regular Maki (Alaska, Philadelphia roll, etc. I prefer the spicy tuna roll here to Akira's. The spicy-to-sweet-to-tuna ratio is well balanced here. Akira's is too spicy to enjoy tuna's taste. I like to get \"sweet potato\". Yes, there is no fish in there. It may sound odd but it tastes good. Try it.)  4 maki rolls for $33, plus salad and soup for two. I haven't found a better deal anywhere else. Seafood is fresh, split the rolls with your dining buddy.  - appetizer: skip coconut shrimp. I ordered it once and found the shrimp flesh stiff. For some reason immediately thought \"they got this from the boxed frozen food section at Costco\".  - I never have hibachi so can't comment on that, but the line is always long on that side."}
{"text":"Love their sushi!  Best on the east side!  Huge pieces of tasty fish, creative new special rolls all the time.  I have tried so many other local sushi places but no places even comes close.  Service is good, can get loud but worth going to for the sushi!"}
{"text":"Went there today for a lunch at 3:00 p.m. Table was sticky.  I felt as though the seat was more clean than the table.  One of the menus looked like it had been soaked in, what I hope was, water. Waitress got us seated quickly, got our drinks, and then promptly forgot about us. The waitress was very nice but just not an outstanding waitress.  I shouldn't have to look for you to get our drinks especially when there was, literally, no one else in the restaurant.  The place smelled of deep fried grease with a hint of sadness.  The food was not very good. The Miso soup tasted like they took Mrs. Grass' chicken soup and boiled a fish head in that.  Yummy!  The \"salad\", had I eaten it, would have caused some serious gastric issues.  I'm not sure what they dumped on the bagged iceberg lettuce but it looked like they combined mayo, French dressing, and a little ranch and then soaked the salad with it.   I had steak teriyaki and my wife had tempura shrimp.  Neither were anything to write home about.  I'm amazed at the good reviews by some people.  Even on their best days I cannot imagine it deserving anything more than two stars.  No one was rude but just not going out of their way to earn a decent tip and the food was just not good.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"I had been hearing about this place for a while and was excited to try it but found that they're not necessarily the best. While I enjoyed their delicious salmon the wasabi sauce wasn't the best. The service was to live for! I would go back for the service alone, the manager was simply amazing."}
{"text":"I had been here many time times, but always forgot to write a review. Not a regular a small sushi place, because the restaurant was spacious with plenty of sitting and huge bar. I liked aquariums and purple lightening.  This time I sat at the bar, and had a pleasant conversation with a bartender- Karolina. She was extremely nice and helpful. She gave me good suggestions toward my order and was able to adjust my order. I was pleased with my experience. Although I had better sushi, I still liked my dinner.  I will comeback just to visit a friendly bartender and enjoy the ambience."}
{"text":"YAY, went out to eat again :)   Tonight's trip brought to us by girlfriends b-day, this went much better than last years ....that I forgot :(   Come on, its a couple days after Christmas, its a hectic time.    Arrived Monday night about 5:30 pm, lots of parking. The entrance is large with fish for the kids to get excited about and ample waiting area, although we strolled right in.  The place is split in two with an average length bar with 2 and 4 top table seating.  There are also 2 semi private rooms that I first thought was traditional Japanese seating until I saw people slipping their legs under the tablecloth !!  So basically you step up on a platform, then sit down on thin cushion. There are  No full booths, but one wall of 1/2 booth seats.  Floors are a bit slick when wet so be careful if you're there with wet shoes.  And if your petty, they play \"jazz\" music, might not have been an issue but I was directly under a BOSE speaker,  I almost missed the typical twangy Asian restaurant music.    Anyway, about our Dining experience.    Monday/Tues happy hr is 1/2 price sushi  maki rolls  5-7 pm so we took full advantage of that !!  We started out with the calamari, and it was great. A full heaping plate full the size of onion rings !!   I wasn't a fan of the dipping sauce, but still ate it nonetheless.  (8 bucks, its  5 on wed/thurs)  we had two huge platters of various sushi rolls and left nothing behind !!  (11 rolls total)  plus a white tuna Sashimi that was awesome !!  sliced thick and very good ...a 1st for me and I thought it good with zero \"fishy fish \" taste.  ( I hate fishy tasting fish)   The rest of the sushi we had was great, the rolls were cut small easy one bites worth without looking like someone cramming at an eating competition .  I'm not a fan of seaweed on the outside of my sushi so none of ours was made in that fashion (can't stand the texture) .   If you like reading  While waiting for the food to arrive I took a stroll to the hibachi side and it was very large with ample seating and double grills for large parties. There was only a few people seated at 5:30 or so but the place was near capacity with only 2 free tables  by 7:00 when we left. There was some smoke in the air on the hibachi side but  that's to be expected since you're sitting in the kitchen !!     Our total before tip was under $50 with no drinks or x-traxs.  I would go again but if you like to go nuts, Mon/Tues is your best value since its 1/2 off maki rolls."}
{"text":"Stopped in here because it was walking distance to my hotel. Had the red dragon and a bottle of sake. The sale was a bit over priced but the fish was fresh and reasonably priced for Ohio.   I sat at the sushi bar, the service was swift and appropriate and appreciated. Only downside was the hostess. She seemed a bit new and unsure if she could let me sit unsupervised at the sushi bar. Had a line of people that she seemed to be ignoring too. Chalk it up to new (I hope)"}
{"text":"1) Host  - Horrible ; had an attitude and was rude. She had her head down the whole time she greeted us . 2) Servers - Okay ; We were seated on the Hibachi side of the restaurant. There were three different parties and about 12 people at the table . None of the three different parties at the table received anything in a timely manner. The servers continually forgot simple request such as providing water when the WHOLE table asked for water in addition to other specialty drinks . NONE, of the drinks were refilled.  3) Cook  - the cook was the BEST. -Made sure all orders were correct! - Took care of all special request!  - REFILLED all sauces before, during and after the cooking process !  -Followed all Allergy food regulations ! - Did the most Work !  My three stars go to the cook and so did my tips !"}
{"text":"Price is great.  Parking is great. Food is great. Entertainment is great!!! Service is Awesome...and its across from the malls arcade room!!!  The Entertainment is great...as in...when they want to put out the fire...they use a doll that squirts water...a little bathroom humor there.  You can have the grill or you can stay at the Sushi Bar, or you can have both.  You order sushi with your meal.  I love this place.  They have 6 grills I believe and great service.    When it comes to uniqueness of food.  You can order things that I have not seen anywhere else.  In fact...I use to loath Steakhouses until I went to Wasabi.  They have a large menu and great teryiaki sauce.  They have Salmon and Chicken as well. It's not all about the Fillet.       It's at the mall facing north...next to BestBuy.    -Thanks"}
{"text":"Fun and entertaining environment. Great place to take the family or a night out with someone. The staff were awesome and very inviting. The cook had us laughing, \"watch yo weave\". You'll get it when you go."}
{"text":"Joe Hayden and his family took up almost the whole dining room and we STILL got phenominal service at this place. We had the specials and they were great! Hats off to everyone there for a great execution! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment four times and I've finally decided to write a review, overall my experience of the food and the service has been consistent but different seats are better than others. First I'll start with what I was saying about the seating, I've haven't tried the hibachi yet but I would definitely like to as I usually love hibachi, in the non hibachi dining room the decor and atmosphere is nice but the tables are quite small if you're there with more than two people. One thing that stands out to me is a special room by the entrance that you have to reserve in advance for parties, that is closed off from the rest of the restaurant and is more spacious. You have to take your shoes off and you sit on a bench with pillows and put your feet under the table, it's really nice unless you have weak knees. The service doesn't forget about you even though you're secluded from the rest of the restaurant. The overall service is also very good, although not all of the servers speak fluent English they are very polite and have never messed up an order for me or anyone else in my party. The wait it isn't especially fast but it's definitely not too bad; the food is absolutely the star of the show and it reasonably priced. Sometimes I like to just order assorted sushi rolls that are not full entrees but it is very nice, so far I've tried the salmon rolls, the California rolls, some octopus sushi, and I believe spicy tuna rolls; as well as some vegetarian rolls. I believe that section of the menu is about 7 to 11 dollars so pretty cheap overall. The sushi rolls are lite and tasty but don't especially stand out from any other sushi. my only real complaint is that the octopus is a little bland and elastic, but it was my first time trying octopus of any kind. However my favorite dish to order is definitely the Tokyo Bento box, the Bento box section is very nice and priced in the low twenties. The Tokyo bento box has delicious assorted sashimi, Tempura vegetables, Grilled shrimp, Seaweed salad, and a giant ball of white sushi rice. I don't drink but they have a substantial saki menu as well. I completely recommend this restaurant if you're in the area."}
{"text":"A very average place, I would say in some aspects a little below average. Prices are a bit steeper than similar establishments I've visited and having to pay extra for fried rice is well, ridiculous."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the area. The decor is modern and the ambience contributes to the 5 stars!   The food is almost always on point. What's also important is that Wasabi offers a wide variety of food so no matter the size of the party and their unique preference, there's always something to satisfy one's palette. The quality of the food also speaks volumes. The sushi is always fresh and mouth watering. The hibachi food is cooked to perfection and there's a wide selection to choose from - whether you're feeling land or sea. My indulgence is the Wasabi Special, the perfect combination of both.   The cocktail menu is bursting with creativity - my personal favorites are from the saketini section of the menu. And finally - dessert. A must have is the hot lava cake if you have room after the delicious meal."}
{"text":"Service was quick and food was average. Prices were about right for a Japanese steakhouse that is hibachi style.   Would probably not need to stop here again.  4 adults was $140 including tip and 4 sodas."}
{"text":"We had made reservations for a large group. they did a good job accommodating us, but there was not enough room in the waiting area for all of us and we were in everyone's way. I don't understand the concept of not seating until everyone is there, when it was such a large group (approx. 30 people). We sat near each other, but not all at the same tables. The food was good, the server was slow. It was nice that they broke the bills down to smaller groups. We paid for three people. I do not like any place who ads on an automatic gratuity, 20% in their case. Then the server said that that was for the chef, and that any additional I would like to leave was for her. The only other knock I had was the shooting of Sake into everyone's mouth. Hey, when a person says enough, stop. Having my clothes covered with Sake is not enjoyable."}
{"text":"A friend and I went there to eat and really enjoyed it. We didn't have the hibachi but maybe next time, the food was great and the waitress was very cordial and helpful, although we did get there after kind of a big snowstorm and it wasn't too busy it was really an enjoyable experience and we hope to be able to go there again soon."}
{"text":"Sushi was actually pretty good for the price and the decor Is very nice.  Happy hour is a very good value.  Good menu variety too, especially for people who want sushi but are ding with someone who wants something else  The downfall with this place though is the service.  I've been here twice and the same bartender is always so rude.  She stands around and talks to the other patrons while you just sit and wait.  You practically have to beg her to get anything.  When the food came out she wouldn't even bring us side plates."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night. Food was good as usual. We had chadman cook for us and he does not disappoint. Too bad he will be going back to Las Vegas in a few months. My niece and nephew love him."}
{"text":"Horrible service. My wife and I came in for the happy hour roll specials and we were rudely told they were not open yet for service although the front door was open and other customers were also coming in. When I tried to contact the restaurants management through Facebook messenger no one responded. After several failed attempts to resolve this issue not on social media I decided to share this poor service here. Hopefully Wasabi responds to other Facebook messenger complains so they don't need to be posted for others to see."}
{"text":"Was dissaponted as well! Went there for a birthday dinner 5-28-17, for my daughter's birthday! Our first time there, was at other location: Too Crowded! Reservations were made, here, but the receptionist, said that she could not hold table for more than 10, mins, dissbut should have informed my daughter who made the reservation; when we had arrived.The waitress was DOING TOO MUCH! Felt like being rushed, drinks got watered down, kept asking for more. There were several other customers , who had there birthday there as well; but when it came  to our table; only the cook, said Happy Birthday!; while the other tables were being sung to, and acknowledging of theirs, My daughter felt embarrassed and dissaponted of not receiving the  same recognition. The food was good, the cook did his part. But the waitress, was DOING TOO MUCH, She must thought that she had an extra tip coming; because she didn't give back, until question of wanting change back, due to tip included already in check."}
{"text":"Hibachi was one of the best I've had! And plenty of sushi selections, and the atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"Sitting here right now. This place never fails to impress. Sure the tricks might get old but the yum yum sauce is A M A Z I N G. love coming here.  Highly recommended for all ages. Although the bathroom smells like eggs for some reason"}
{"text":"Was delighted to have Hibachi on Mother's Day with mom, grandma and my siblings. Quite a show when they cook. Had the scallop and sirloin. Tried one of grandma's lobster piece~ the taste is ok but tastes best when not in the place of a Hibachi kitchen. Scallops were yummy. Yum yum sauce is pretty good~shared my extra :) Grandma was so happy, delightful day and enough food to last throughout dinner. The noodles are the best part! My mom bought some of their homemade ginger salad dressing which is sold @ $1 per ounce by 5 or 10 ounce containers.   The bar in the front is quite a different sensation than the Wasabi in Akron, Ohio.   Cannot complain, all smiles~"}
{"text":"Heed the warnings. Not good experience. I doubt yours will be any better by what I saw."}
{"text":"One of the best hibachi places I've been to. The show was good and funny. Service was fine and they got the birthday girl blizted on white wine shot into her mouth repeatedly.   Had the scallops and steak both were cooked wonderfully, and it's nice that it included noodles but there was way too much food to eat in one sitting.   Only reason they don't get five stars is they have a $2 upcharge for fried rice vs white rice but it is not listed anywhere on the menu."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with what I experienced. It might have been because my family and I came in as soon as they opened, but the quality of the food was just not up to par with the d√©cor and overall ambience.   I ordered the Kyoto Bento box. The miso soup and ginger salad that came before was good. The box itself contained a really small amount of seaweed salad, a California roll, white rice, and two skewers of grilled chicken with some onion and green peppers...and then a bed of more grilled chicken. The chicken was lukewarm and the teriyaki sauce drowning it was relatively tasteless. Maybe I was expecting too much, but for the price tag, I think I was ok in expecting more.   I wouldn't write this off your list if you live in the suburbs of Cleveland, but if you're a tourist, there're so many other places to experience."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great, fresh and inventive sushi. The chicken teriyaki was great too! The waitresses were very attentive and the atmosphere was modern, clean and comfortable.  Unfortunately I doubt I'll be back in the area anytime soon, but if I am, I'll be sure to eat here!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, and a good atmosphere.  Arrive hungry, and leave stuffed.  I practically had to be rolled back to my hotel room after this meal.  I didn't eat on the steak-house side, but everyone that did sounded like they were having a great time."}
{"text":"What can I say but they have yummy sushi. We go there often. They also have great \"yum yum\" sauce, very rich, sweet and savory. You sushi lovers know what I mean. Their selection on the menu is good, and the happy hour  1/2 price maki specials can't be beat. They have a good wine selection with an average pour. We always sit at the bar and enjoy the memorizing water feature behind the bar. You can also see it if you sit at a table in the front section. The bar can get busy at happy hour so come early if you want a seat. The service is fast and usually friendly. We will continue to haunt this middle to upscale establishment for great sushi."}
{"text":"Another so so place - nothing spectacular - nothing new, but if you've never been to a place like this - it will be fun and exciting.  The selection is typical and the pricing is reasonable - you might be eating with other people though - so plan on that!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday, sat at a hibachi table with my husband & kids. The waiter squirted so much sake into another person's (at our table) mouth, she spit some of it on the floor. At the request of my husband, I ordered the most expensive hibachi meal on the menu. The patron across from me (with all the sake) requested to sample my food while it was on the grill. The chef explained she didn't order the food. She became belligerent and obnoxious and scared my kids. I was so upset, I took my very expensive dish, untouched right off the grill, and slammed it down in front of her. I told her, \"I lost my daughter 12 weeks ago, it's my birthday, I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE FOOD.\" And I walked out with my crying children. All the chef had to say was \"sorry\". And the manager? Oh, the manager was very busy trying to appease the drunk, obnoxious, belligerent patron. The manager said NOTHING to me or my family and offered no relief for our horrible experience. We paid 100% of our bill, plus tip. I will never go here again & if I could give it a lower rating, I would. Despicable customer service. Despicable restaurant."}
{"text":"On their website the hours specifically state 11-3 for lunch. I called to order take-out sushi at 2:15 and was told they close at 2:30, so they could not accommodate my order. Please don't advertise something you can't fulfill on your website. I will be finding another sushi place for any future sushi take-out."}
{"text":"My all time favorite hibachi grill in the US of A! I have had it in Louisiana, Texas, Tennessee, California, and Ohio (youngstown,warren,cleveland) and this place has to be my absolute favorite! The chefs are very engaging and the food taste great every tike definitely a better option to me than benihanas. I have been to the one in medina/Fairlawn on the hill and that one is my favorite I moved to Cleveland and I love this one also! A must stop if you are in the Cleveland area and in the mood for hibachi!"}
{"text":"Every time we go here someone from the wrong side of town is arguing with the staff or the chef or another customer. They allow customers to be incredibly rude to their own staff and other customers. They may allow you to move your table if some drunk/high agitated customer starts yelling at your family but why even be in this situation. Go some place classier. This is not it."}
{"text":"Had a great time, the wait was long to sit down in the Hibachi section.  The service was slow but they rewarded our patience with free Sakki !  YAH ,  the shrimp was delicious, chicken good, and steak was solid,  I would recommend getting the Meat Trio for 3 more bucks you get Chicken w Shrimp Steak why not, you don't go here everyday.  Everyone had a great meal, but a guy ordered Shrimp and Steak but got Chicken and Steak.  He was stuck then with Chicken and Steak, which I though they could of just got him more Shrimp, that was weird not the best customer service I must say in that regards.   just get more shrimp, why not ,  other than that the meal for me was great,  the Sakki was hilarious and entertaining, the guy did plenty of tricks and etc,  balanced the egg,  then threw Zuchini in our mouths, I caught 2/5 not bad,  was very entertained overall, Fried rice was good but some pieces where to hard, It would probably be  3.7 stars but I will round up to 4."}
{"text":"I have one general pet peeve with a restaurant and that is do not have a multi-course meal and then serve it all at the same time. I got my soup, salad and entree within minutes of each other. No timing of the meal at all, my shrimp and scallops where cold by the time I got to them. Some unidentified person stopped by to see how my meal was and I said that it was cold since I finished my soap and salad first.   He wanted to put the entree under a heat lamp to keep it warm and I said that will kill the shrimp and scallops and make them rubber. While they did offer to re-fire the meal, I said no, as my evening and expectations had been ruined. They did comp my meal; I insisted that I would pay for it, even though I only took two or three bites of cold scallop. They never gave me a bill and avoid me like the plague for the next half hour to 45 minutes while I tried to pay for the meal and leave the waitress a tip.   If you go here and have a seat on the right hand side of the restaurant, be sure you tell them to space out the meal, unless you want to eat cold food after getting everything delivered at once."}
{"text":"First off, I would like to say how awesome the entryway is. Glass blocks with koi fish floating around underneath your feet? Yes please! I could stand there and look at them all day! I think it's very smart for a restaurant to have something interesting for people to look at while they wait, especially kids. Am I saying I'm a big kid fascinated by fancy fish? Perhaps.  The d√©cor was much nicer inside than most sushi/hibachi places I have been. I really enjoyed the ambiance lighting and the sounds of running water from the fountains. Kind of made me have to use the restroom, but it was soothing non the less.    We started with some Edamame. I had never tried it before but it was quite good. There was excellent flavor and a few of them wouldn't stuff you before dinner. Unfortunately, I wasn't very hungry so I only ordered a small plate of the spicy crab roll. Still delicious, but I would have loved to try something extravagant. My friends plate was so fancy! I don't even remember what he ordered but the presentation was eye catching. I wanted my food to be brought to me in a fancy format! Next time I come here I'm ordering for an army and photographing it all!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst birthday dinner in my 37 years. The worst service food was awful.  This man cooking food payed more attention to the other tables then our table! Will not be back to this location will make the drive to beechwood much better and service is a hell of a lot better!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times before. I have to say that the service and cleanliness have gone downhill since last time. The food, however, was the best I've ever had here, and the chef was very lively and entertaining."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Was told 20 minutes in reality it was over an hour with no explanation. They Seemed to be focused too much on theatrics and not quality food and service."}
{"text":"I have been to Wasabi a couple times on my visits to Cleveland.  This is a standard Japanese steakhouse.  They offer a full hibachi and sushi menu.  The service is attentive and the prices are pretty standard for this type of establishment.  I have always had a nice time here and the chefs do a nice job of including the diners and making it fun.  Good spot for hibachi in this part of CLE!"}
{"text":"On May 27th, I was with a larger group celebrating a coworker's retirement. I expected things to be a little hectic with service just because of the size. However, it took a long time to even be asked what we wanted to drink. Our salads and soups came out before the drink orders. Two of us ordered sushi while the rest got the hibachi dinners. Our food came out way after everyone else was already was done eating and we had to ask twice. The manager tells us that they were too busy with happy hour orders to get our food out to us on time. What a way to make a customer feel important. Then they moved the group to a different room for cake that was brought so we had to drag our plates and drinks with us. We didn't even pick up our plates before the guy was wiping down the table. The bill was wrong. They over charged us for our meals. After the manager said she would adjust the bill it was incorrect again. When the manner was addressed she took the two of us up by the front door to handle this. You don't handle an issue right where customers are entering. When we asked to move, she ignored us. This was such a poor experience that I couldn't recommend this place to anyone. I will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"Fantastic , fresh sushi!  You have to try the angry dragon roll.  Brittany was our bartender/server.  She was very professional,  but playful...a perfect host.  This was a business dinner with 3 people and all of us enjoyed the experience.  The happy hour prices are the best in town.  $2 off drinks and half off maki."}
{"text":"Good service tonight. Our chef, mike, did a fantastic job. Was very entertaining and engaged, and it was the first time I've ever had a chef there not overcook the crap out of the scallops. In the past I've had less than stellar experiences at wasabi restaurants, but if tonight's experience is an indication of things to come, I may not trash the place to all my friends"}
{"text":"This restaurant sucks like Midway Mall. Food was downright cold and tasteless. If this is your first time trying Japanese cuisine, avoid this place at all cost. Actually no, avoid this place at all cost no matter if you had tried Japanese cuisine before. Even the mall food court food is better than this."}
{"text":"Got the chicken and steak hibachi and HOLY COW was it so much food! The lychee martini was delicious as well. There was a wait for sushi so I'm assuming it's delicious, but the wait staff and chef were super welcoming and funny. I have 2 other meals leftover now yum!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful venue--when you walk in, you pass a koi pond grotto before coming to the maitre'd station, with overhead blue green lights casting shadows down a wavy white wall. The restaurant portion is relatively small, but also very tasteful, with (fake) green bamboo stalks separating it from the bar area with a blue bubbling water wall. I felt like I was in NYC or Vegas rather than Beachwood!  We enjoyed the coconut shrimp appetizer, which was slightly sweet, although a bit overdone. Miso soup was standard, but the salad had a tasty ginger-based dressing which was light but flavorful. My friend had an assortment of sushi, while I enjoyed an enormous chirashi bowl with sushi rice, tobiko, salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and two other types of fish. The slices were generous, fresh, and flavorful. Definitely a good deal! This is some of the best sushi I've had in Cleveland and definitely the most interesting ambiance. I look forward to returning and trying more sushi or the hibachi side."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi spots near me.  I am there once sometimes twice a week and everytime it's amazing.  Never a bad experience.  The sushi is amazing and the quality is excellent.  Also the service is spot on and everyone there I have experienced is so nice.  I have had a ton of sushi there as well as other dishes from the hibachi menu and even more and everything has been really good and there is never a wait for your food even when they are busy, which is most of the time. Also the best thing there to me is the sashimi for the sushi their list is huge compared to other spots I have been to.  Other spots' selections are miniscule compared to the rest of the menu but not here.  I will continue to come and eat here and will love it and the food every time!"}
{"text":"Food good, service great - manager - complete unprofessional jerk.  They dropped out gift card and he basically held my party hostage asking to confirm that the gift card was purchased, looking at security footage, etc.  We will never be back to this location so long as he is the manager.  They found the card finally after the manager threatened the server to find it or pay for it."}
{"text":"Best hibachi chef ever!!!!  Good food and fantastic pina colada. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Japanese steakhouse!!! We heard it was good and thought to give it a try - and happy we did. The atmosphere is nice, a bit on the schickie side and definitely feels new.  I love hibachi cooking and have been to many steakhouses over the years. The food here was just as good as my other favorites! The biggest difference I noticed is that they gave you fried noodles with your order too. I've never had this anywhere else before and must say I enjoyed it!  The service was also great! The hostess was extremely accommodating to our seating requests, the waiter was fully on top of his game and the cook was entertaining and fun.  If I lived closer this place would be on my bi-weekly visit list!"}
{"text":"Service was subpar at best. Asked for water SEVERAL times. No refills on ANY soft drink. Waitress rushed us through once dinner was over. We had a party of 15 but she handled only 7 of us. It's not hard, it's hibachi.  The salad, though the dressing is the best of the best, a little bit more than a couple pieces of lettuce would be better. The soup, bland and boring. I was thrown a to go bag when there was no to go container to take home.  Chef was great, slow, but great. Food was cold by the time everything was done.  Disappointing that this is the only location that does not do the \"shrimp catch\" at the end of the chef cooking.  The experience was only given 2 stars because of the waitress, just not good at all.  The Wasabi in Fairlawn blows this location away by a landslide! And lastly, it was FREEZING cold the entire evening.  Won't return!"}
{"text":"Two of my best friends decided to have a small dinner party here a few years ago. Mind you, when I say small, we mean 10+ people. Anyway, I've heard of this place and I often pass it when I drive around the area.  The outside is not that pleasing to the eye but once you go inside, it is absolutely gorgeous! The water, fish and aquariums just lining up the wall, it brings a calm yet truly oriental feeling into the restaurant.  Our chef was absolutely phenomenal and hilarious! Truly good food, laughs, entertainment and alcohol to boot. Crazy expensive, roughly $25 a plate but definitely worth it because the portions are relatively large, the service is wonderful and the chefs are highly skilled and a delight to be around!  The only factor that prevents this place from getting the full 5 stars is the salad with house dressing. Note, I enjoy salad and I enjoy salad dressing but my main rule is light on the dressing or better yet, put it on the side so I can determine my own intake. I rather have a light sprinkle so I can taste both dressing and vegetables rather than have a \"salad soup.\" The dressing was a huge turnoff to me. Not only it was overly abundant but it was too bitter for my tastes. It's depressing that I couldn't even withstand more than 2 bites, for I hate to just leave food there without a substantial amount eaten. Truly, I wanted to enjoy it but I couldn't.  Nevertheless, a great place to dine with friends or a great place for a small dinner party. Highly recommended and definitely get some alcohol, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A great place for a big party.  Very friendly staff. My favorite part is hibachi cooking. The cooks are very funny. Kept us laughing that evening"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the octopus and seaweed salad for appetizer and A tempura with it. Food here is really good. Presentation goes with its taste. I will definitely come back..."}
{"text":"Had phenomenal hibachi! The atmosphere is outstanding, I have never been to a restaurant so fun. Our chef was awesome and he participated with l of our guests. It was a great experience because the whole restaurant is so upbeat. The food was also outstanding, and everything was very fresh. The decorations and surroundings are very nice and I look forward to bringing more people here. I would definitely bring another party group. Service was attentive and very friendly. This area needed a hibachi place like this."}
{"text":"This place has a very friendly atmosphere, and the staff is very nice. But my food cam 25 minutes later then everyone else in my party of 9 ( I ordered a bento box.) when I got my food it was cold and it wasn't even that great. They wouldn't even give me a discount since I had to wait for my food. overall not that great of a place"}
{"text":"What a fun place to eat at!  It was my daughter's birthday  and we were home visiting unexpectedly.  A friend recommended this restaurant so we gave it a try.  My daughter, her boyfriend and I chose Hibachi and were seated at a table with two other groups.  A group of two men with a teenage boy, and another group of two guys who were glued to their cell phones.  Needless to say we were not exactly the \"fun\" table.    The three at the end ordered AMAZING looking sushi - Dragon Rolls.  I cannot vouch for how these tasted other than to say two of them were devoured by the group of three - and they were HUGE!!! I did hear things like \"Mmmmm\" and \"so good\" after parts of the sushi were consumed so I can only assume this meant that it was superb.    The chef was great, and I think a little disappointed that this group of people randomly put together at the table was not the most animated.  But he had us laughing during the cooking of the food and was EXTREMELY generous with the \"Yum Yum Sauce\", which is the best stuff ever in the history of sauces!  Calories be damned, I used it generously.   So all in all the food was super delicious though the chicken was a little dry.(This from a women who has converted her chicken choices over to chicken thighs from chicken breasts.  It makes a difference.)  We thoroughly enjoyed the dinner and had an enormous amount of food leftover for later meals.  My mom was the beneficiary of this as we traveled back to Michigan the next day leaving the precious gift in her fridge.   Prices were great.  Our group of three all drank water and got the chicken dinner.  We walked out at a little over $60.00 for the three of us.  As for the guys on the end with the Dragon Rolls and many drinks...I can only imagine what their bill was - but they sure didn't mind a bit.     I will definitely go back and try the sushi next time I am in town."}
{"text":"The only reason for 2 stars is that they have a chef named Chadman who is very good. The rest of the staff is less than accomidating! My family and I have been here 8 times or more with the last 3 times being average or poor. 1/10/15 we went for hibachi and sushi, the wait quoted \"15 minutes\" the actual wait, 1 hour. We decided to sit at the bar to wait and have a beer and some sushi, we were walked past 10+ times and not acknowledged.  I finally got the attention of a waitress passing through the sushi/bar area and got us a drink, this was after sitting there ignored for 15 minutes.   Finally after nearly an hour long wait we get to our hibachi seat and place our order, 4 appetizers and 4 hibachi dinners. We had the seaweed salad, shrimp dumplings,  spring rolls and edamame. The seaweed salad was average at best, the rest of the appetizers were a joke! The spring rolls were $6 and you get 4 of them about the size of your thumb, what a joke! The shrimp dumplings were the size of tater tots and you get 6 rubbery flavorless pieces of garbage. The edamame was ok, probably the best part of the meal was the sushi, we got the #23 chili roll, it was acceptable.    The hibachi was worse than gross, we had hibachi salmon and shrimp and noodles.  The salmon did not even resemble salmon in color or flavor. It looked more like they were trying to charge us for salmon and pass off some cheap piece of tilapia in its place. it did not look fresh at all! It was virtually white, I don't know about you but I've never seen white salmon! We got the rookie chef that was \"in testing\" we were told. Really! We spent nearly $200 on our meal and the only thing we were left with was heartburn from all the garlic! Our chef had no idea how to season food or put on a true hibachi experience!  Everything was seasoned the same, the rice, blobs of fresh chopped garlic, the noodles, oil and fresh chopped garlic, the salmon and shrimp fresh chopped garlic!   I could go on for days but you get the point. Go to Fujiama in Avon or Arashi in Westlake,  you will actually get what you pay for. This is just a ghetto knock off just like everything at Midway Mall! Called management to give them a chance to fix it and the said sorry there was nothing they could do! WOW!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with my company for business and I was amazed at how good it was. I've been to the standard hibachi restaurants but this has so much more food. We ordered about 4 rolls of sushi which were all great and the meal itsekf comes with salad, soup, fried rice, two types of meat and or seafood, and noodles. They also go around with saki and shoot it in your mouth periodically throughout the meal. Our chef was funny and engaging and the waiter was very helpful and friendly. Overall this was a great meal after a long day of work. I would recommend this but prepare to be out of commission for a little while after, it's a LOT of food!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful. The atmosphere is electric. The decor is modern sheick. The food is hibachi and you can't go wrong with that. The cook gave a good show. The manager and owner are extremely attentive to customer needs and I give them A+ grade."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here , the food is always delicious , and service is great ! The only things is, sometimes the people at the front desk don't know what they are doing . Every time I come , I usually just eat sushi and order some teriyaki chicken with fried rice on the side and it is considered hibachi, but how about when I was there're last night ,the girl at the front desk told me if I order hibachi food then I have to sit at the hibachi side. I told her I'm still going to sit on the sushi side , then went on with my order with the waitress and I still got the usual ... Nothing changed. Just the people at the front desk don't know what's going on or something ."}
{"text":"Yummy. ...worth the trip. Loved the sushi and everything else we ordered!   Also their flavored martinis are soooo good!   Never had to wait long for a table and service was great"}
{"text":"I've been to Wasabi more times than I can remember.  I figured it's time to update my review.  Unfortunately, I have nothing new or exciting to add.  Wasabi is my son's favorite restaurant and he's only 7!  Is he spoiled or what?  The place is pricey ($25/plate on average), so we only go on special occasions for the kids.  I usually order the veggie hibachi to save a couple bucks.  The portions are large, which I love.  The yum yum sauce is still as good as usual, but our chef wasn't much of an actor on this visit.  He didn't do nearly the number of tricks that the other chefs usually do except for the onion volcano, sake, and throwing food at us.  He missed everyone's mouth except mine, and that's partially because I can catch food with the best of em.    Wasabi is good, but we only go when the kids want to go on special occasions.  I would consider having sushi, but I could probably find similar quality for less cash nearby at Kumo."}
{"text":"I've been to Wasabi Steak House quite often and sometimes it's the best service ever, and sometimes it's okay. More recently the service has been okay -- the chefs aren't as\"fun\" anymore.   Let's start with the food - amazing options and always good quality. You have two options - traditional dinner or hibachi. We always do the hibachi, where the chef makes it in front of you. The chefs are usually funny and do a great job making the food. I think I've come here one and had awful food by a chef who had no idea what he was doing (and it's sad because it was for my graduation too). However, every time we come here, I've never had an issue with the food. I always get the steak dinner with fried rice or the chicken and steak. My boyfriend gets the scallops and fillet. We also got a lobster tail and it was absolutely delicious (and I hate seafood). The only issue of the night was there was another person at our table who didn't get fried rice when he had ordered it, but they went to the back and got it for him. Besides that, always good options.  Drinks are always very strong but delicious. They have three categories of drinks $7,8,9 and all are a good bang for your buck. They also have hot tea, soft drinks, and Japanese Soda which is also very good.   The show that they put on is always fun. Lots of Saki (Japanese liquor) and fire. Some chefs make it more fun than others, however, they do make it entertaining. Like I said, I've had one or two bad chefs, but usually they are all really well experienced.   Now, the service. This is the reason I have to take off one star. We made reservations and we still waited 15 minutes for a table and were seated with those who walked in.  You know we are coming at a certain time -- 5 minutes I get; but 15!! Our waitress was pretty slow too, and the table that was seated after us finished at the same time we did -- and we were there first. The service used to be amazing, but now it's going a bit downhill.   Nonetheless, much nicer than Benihana and would recommend to come here for a nice dinner or if you're celebrating something. Or if you just want some free Saki with your meal."}
{"text":"I had never been to one of these type of restaurants before, and I don't think I'll be frequenting any in the near future. Because of this I'm going to give it three stars, in reality I would give it two. Really expensive, food all tastes the same. Cook and waitress really nice. I wouldn't go here unless you had kids or a birthday party."}
{"text":"I travel 26 weeks a year and always look for a great place to eat and relax.  I have found it.  Had a great dinner and appetizers recommended by my bartender Brittney W.  I highly recommend coming and finding out for yourself.  Great food and great environment.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great place for wasabi! We went there for a really late lunch. It seems that they will seat everyone by the wasabi table first and then ask the chef to come and cook. I didn't like that because then we'll have to wait for a while for more people to be seated. Anyways, my bf got the sashimi bowl, which was basically sashimi on sushi rice in a giant bowl. It was a huge portion but I think he liked it. The fatty tuna was not the best I've had. It's also got fish bone in them. so yea.. maybe not fatty tuna from this place. For wasabi, you should ALWAYS order fried rice, although that'll cost you a few extra dollars but it's well worth it. I got the white rice and didn't even touch it cuz my bf's fried rice was much better than mine. The wasabi food was just very general. Tasted kinda like the wasabi I had in asia but a little milder. But the flavor is definitely there. But they can afford it to make the flavor more intense I think. The chef cooked my steak prefectly medium rare.  The chef will also do a few tricks at the begining, like throwing eggs, setting up a fire or something haha. It was entertaining to watch. Overall, a pretty good wasabi place for cleveland, but I probably miss the wasabi in asian more - it tastes more flavorful and also cheaper ;) But hey we are in Cleveland so I guess I'm happy with it!"}
{"text":"Ok so I love fresh cooked food and this place is prefect for just that! Its hibachi style american cooking. So the food is buttery and greasy. I mean everything is served that way. Think your eating healthy think again lol. The chef did a lot of cooking tricks which was amusing. FIRE lol. He passed out sake like water and told corny funny jokes. Now the waiter was really nice and down to earth. He doubled checked our order and he got the order prefect. I think he was nervous because  he was sweating lol."}
{"text":"This would be a one star rating except the food was mostly tasty and you get a large quantity so that's the only redeeming factor.   The service here was abysmal. It took forever for our drink order to be taken, forever for the drinks to arrive, forever for the first course to arrive (soup and salad), forever for the chef to arrive, etc. I'm not exaggerating, friends. Tables seated after us had drinks and apps and were already having fun with their chef before anything even remotely kicked off for us.   Once our chef did arrive, he noticed the server didn't leave the ticket behind and therefore he didn't know what any of has ordered. So he stood there yelling \"Table 6, I need my server!' and she was no where to be found. Awkward indeed. He eventually just took everyone's word for it to avoid a further delay. When the server did appear, it was with the wrong sushi order for another group at our table. She clearly couldn't handle getting drinks from the bar, delivering appetizers and drinks, or supporting the chef...which is the job.   The chef left much to be desired as well. There was no Saki offered to our table and very few few tricks. Just really dull and disappointing.  Also, avoid the bathroom here at all cost. I felt like I needed at least 2 showers to recover from that.   Maybe you'll have a better time with quality server and engaging chef but since neither are a guarantee, visit this location at your own risk."}
{"text":"Be sure to make reservations on the weekends and bring a group that knows how to have fun... Food will be thrown and sake will be spilled so be prepared!"}
{"text":"This steakhouse was dismal.  Signage was broken, with the outside signage missing a letter.  The awning was spray painted.  Once you walked inside, the carpeting was old, torn and very dirty.  I decided to order the Hibachi Chicken Lunch Special.  The chicken was dry and salty, the rice was mushy, no texture and very little taste other than a bit salty.  The service was poor, taking a long time to order.   I recommend not going to this restaurant, and made that suggestion to the front desk staff at my hotel."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful! I love the decor and atmosphere. The service away great, and the sushi was phenomenal! The Montrose roll is my new favorite!"}
{"text":"Lots of food, fun, and flare! Great for any occasion, the trip to this hibachi steakhouse will leave you happy and full. Our chef didn't have the crazy skills or bubbling personality that you might associate with hibachi, but he was generous in his servings and cooked our steak, shrimp, and chicken perfectly (which is quite the feat considering he was cooking for 8)! Unlike some other hibachi places, you get rice AND noodles with your entree, each perfectly seasoned. Great ambience here at Wasabi, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Overall the longer detailed reviews nail it here. its overpriced and definitely has some hangups like the seating policy and seating in general. it almost felt like I entered a military zone with the rules and precise seating.  Ups: sake shots! i personally didn't partake but those around me came back for round 2.   Food is prepared fresh and served hot. Although the scallops looked a bit overdone.  They can seat larger groups-8 at a single grill.  It's a crowd pleaser even if the grill chef messes up his \"tricks\".  Downs: Bathrooms lack hand towels so you have to touch the door handle...and so does everyone who touches your plates, silverware, food, etc.   You won't be seated until your entire party arrives, even though there's empty tables all around.  Plates weren't very clean and had grease marks and spots.  There's French fried onions in the watered-down, tastes-nothing-like-miso-soup! Who wants soggy stuff in their soup?   Poor hibachi artist had to wheel his cart back to the kitchen bc someone forgot to ignite the grill.  In the end, it entertains the younger ones and is worth a shot once in awhile. You'll go broke, but be filled otherwise."}
{"text":"HIbachi style or sushi style ....you cannot go wrong with this place! The bar is a nice place to hang out and eat sushi or even hibachi! They have sitting places just for sushi and they also have private rooms for sushi and hibachi! They sit you down at a hibachi table once your table is ready. It comes with miso soup and salad to start with. I love their salad! You can also ask for siracha sauce if you want to eat it with your meal! The servers are always nice and attentive. The hibachi itself is very fun and enjoying to watch. The chief comes in and does a little show for you while preparing your meal.The food itself is very tasteful and delicious. i would recommend this Japanese restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"I'm going out on a limb and going 4 star based on 1) reliability 2) value and 3) atmosphere.  Admittedly, I've never had hibachi here.  1) I typically visit Wasabi North Canton for work and do the rolls and seaweed salad.  Our visit to Beachwood consisted of wine, maki rolls, soup & salad, and sashimi.  All were on par with North Canton.  The soup and salad were included with our maki dinner for two.  Maki selection was not gigantic but the traditional American sushi rolls were present.  2) Speaking of that Maki dinner for two, the $33 meal included 2 standard and 2 signature rolls, soup and salad.  The wine selection was adequate and had good value wines.  The place was crowded but not overly so, and the food came out quick.  3) Wasabi's are beautiful buildings, outside and in.  Probably the nicest I've been to.  It's what I want when I want good, medium upscale sushi near home."}
{"text":"Don't miss out on the Red Dragon roll and sashimi deluxe. Happy hour 6$ 22oz Kirin was a bonus!"}
{"text":"First, let me say that this place gives enough food for me to have leftovers and I generally always enjoy the food.  You can get the same Hibachi type food at almost anyplace, but I do like that Wasabi gives noodles with rice.  Chefs are entertaining, too.  Now, allow me to get to my experience.  I went here for a dinner on Friday night and, not surprisingly, there were a lot of birthday parties there.  Cool, I like that atmosphere.  There was a full table behind us who were shouting and yelling like they were in a house party or a nightclub.  Cussing with their kids at the table and hollering to onlookers that \"my money is the same as everyone's and I'll do what I want here\" for well over an hour.  These people were also saying inappropriate things to women walking out from the restaurant, even those who were clearly married.  By the time I left, I felt like I was at a sports event, except I just spent $100 for a dinner and experience.  Throughout the entire night, management was nowhere to be found.    I will never go back to this place as it doesn't have anything that necessarily differentiates it from another hibachi restaurant and their patron behavior was unacceptable and ignored by the management team.  I can do better at Otani in Mayfield, easily."}
{"text":"Hibachi places are pretty much all the same but every once in a while, you find a place that does just a couple of things differently and that separates them from the rest of the herd!  Wasabi delivered on many fronts.  While we waited very briefly for a table, we had drinks at the bar and were all impressed with the unique martini and specialty drink selection.  The food was of great quality and  portions as most hibachi places.  And it's standard to get soup, the ginger dressed salad and special fried rice--but this place also provided a tasty noodle side dish and extra sauces to douse onto your food.  Service was as average this night.  Sometimes you are lucky if you get a smile and a water refill.  The chef's humor was insane and the interactions with him and our random group of hibachi table mates made for an awesome dining experience."}
{"text":"Katz Club reminded me of space travel. Wasabi reminded me of a space station. Or Capsule, the old bar in Lakewood that I still mourn for. There is a beautiful blue wall of water behind the bar. A wall of glass filled with 10 foot lucky bamboo plants separates the hibachi dining area from the rest of the restaurant. My colleague wanted to celebrate quarterly bonuses so along we went. I thought the pricing would be too high to merit a visit however I was wrong. This is a good lunch option for Rockside Road. The chicken hibachi was $9. Steak and chicken combo was $12. The sushi was fresh and a nice appetizer. The meal comes with a small salad with ginger dressing. No miso was included which was a bummer. The service was attentive and overall a great lunch. I would urge the reader to visit based on the beauty of the surroundings if nothing else."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that I walked in wasabi just 3 MINUTES before they close ( I actually didn't know what time they close ) I still got a very welcoming service and the food was still on point.."}
{"text":"Wasabi is your typical \"Japanese\" hibachi grill. They separate the dining experiences hibachi on one side & sushi on the other. I recommend dining hibachi & ordering sushi as an app. The hibachi side is nicely decorated with a bubble wall, Japanese blossom trees. Hibachi as always means your dining with strangers! I had the lunch portion filet mignon it was decent in flavor, came with lo-mein noodles, mixed vegetables, salad with ginger dressing, no soup, & they charge $2.00 extra for fried rice. I also ordered a lychee martini, back home this was my go to drink. I found wasabis' to be highly sweet & the fruit not fresh. We didn't try any sushimi today only managed to order a cooked roll known as the super crunch roll. It was great, large in size & could easily be shared between 2-3 people. We will come back for dining on the sushi side, update coming soon."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of hibachi.  If it's your birthday you'll celebrate with the rest of the restaurant or at least we did in a Friday night.  I always get filet and shrimp and I'm always happy, way too full, and leftovers for days after.  You can't think of it as a $30 meal because it's really three meals for me.    I've been to a few hibachis and this one is aesthetically the nicest.  The only thing I thought was maybe off is that the noodles come at the end instead of with the rice... and by that point you can't move from being so full so they might as well put it in the to go box then.  The other thing that was interesting is our chef cleaned the stove right then and there and we couldn't pay or box up until he was done, and it's quite the process.  Never knew... it was interesting but also slightly annoying.  Either way, foods good, I'll be back.  No kids at our table so not that many tricks... still entertaining.  Our waiter did a good job even though it's not your normal interaction."}
{"text":"Now I've honestly only eaten outside the Hibachi tables, but Wasabi is my favorite local place for Japanese fare. I was here on launch day, and they have definitely grown to work out all of their kinks. This is my new all-time favorite lunch spot. They have a great lunch menu, and the real gem is their $10 maki special. You receive 3 maki rolls and a salad; it's all perfectly speedy for working people on their short lunch. I've been here for dinner recently as well, and while we received slightly more relaxed service, everything came out perfect. The sushi is top-notch, and they offer plenty of customizations for beginner sushi eaters.  If you've only frequented the Hibachi portion here, I'd recommend expanding your territory into the more traditional Japanese dishes they offer. The tonkatsu is the Japanese version of schnitzel, and it is fabulous here! Their yakisoba (think gourmet Sakkio) and udon are also superb. I can't think of a better Japanese restaurant in Cleveland, and I'm a sucker for all Asian culinary creations."}
{"text":"Had an overall positive experience. The decor is incredible and all of the hibachi chefs were fun to have. However, I found the food to be a little pricey for the amount that you receive. Also, we had to wait around for quite some time before our hibachi chef arrived from another table. I got the sense that they were a bit under-staffed. I will give them the benefit of the doubt, however, since I was there only the second time they were open."}
{"text":"Happy hour at Wasabi is such a great deal -  I hate that happy hour seems to be getting harder and harder to find, so we were ecstatic to discover the one here. They have specials on their plain jane rolls (my favs anyway!) and awesome drink deals. I think we ordered heaping pile of like 6 rolls and 2 drinks and still got out of there for around 30 some dollars? Can you believe that?  Their sushi is good. We stick to the tuna avocado and salmon avocado with a spicy tuna roll in there somewhere. I'm not really a huge fan of hibachi (I mean, it's good, but it's not usually something I seek out) so I can't speak for theirs. Go here for their sushi happy hour and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Umm their sushi is frickin AMAZING!!!! Seriously the best sushi I've ever tasted!!!!! Nothing compares! And their service was great as well! Would go back there for sure!!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 so made a reservation the day before. Seated right away. They really need some new menus they're falling apart! Come on! At $20 + a plate they should be able to fix em. Our chef was entertaining and friendly. He doesn't have much of an aim when squirting drinks into people's mouths! Had to bust out glasses wipes to clean em up. Great experience. Our server was on it! They included 18% gratuity on our bill since we had a party of 6. That was fine. Jut felt bad cause server should have at least gotten 20%. That's the tipping MINIMUM!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed my wife and I had dinner here on New Year's Eve,  there was no flavor or depth in our food. The cooking show is fine but what makes someone return to a restuarant is the food and this place just fell flat, the portion are big but what good is that if the taste is not there, the food we took home went into the garbage."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome chefs that are more interactive than other similar place and noodles come with the entree, which is great.  Major disappointment:  didn't pack up the sauces with our substantial leftovers.  :("}
{"text":"Came here on Wednesday and I must say how much my boyfriend and I loved this place!  The decor is classy and beautiful and I loved the Koi fish pond they had near the entrance!  Our server was attentive and great and our Hibachi chef was seriously amazing!!!! My boyfriend and I are from the Chicagoland area and so was the chef! He was very kind and funny and the best Hibachi chef I've ever had.  To top it all off, the people we sat with were great too!  Overall just an amazing experience. The food was absolutely delicious and the portions were HUGE. Definitely worth the price which isn't even much compared to other Hibachi places.  The only thing I'm sad about is how I can't come back here without having to drive 5 hours. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and layout. Fantastic sushi rolls too. A friend picked ours so I don't know which one it was. The salad and soup were good but not outstanding. I had the chicken & scallop hibachi which again was good but not outstanding. The service was solid and the chefs were entertaining. I'd go back but it's not one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3.5 stars, because that's what I really think this place deserves based on my experience.   Atmosphere: Wow, this place looks fun. Like.. Really fun. It's very cool and modern inside. Whoever designed the restaurant did an excellent job. I love the subtle lighting throughout the entire restaurant.   Service: Our waitress was really nice. The food came out rather quickly, and there wasn't much to complain about from that regard.   Food: This is where things take a turn... The food was..ok. There was nothing that wowed me with the meal, but nothing that sucked either. I ordered a chicken teriyaki dish.. It came on a bed of raw onions... What...? That's so bizarre, I wasn't sure what the purpose of those onions were, but no thank you. I wish the amount of effort that went into designing the restaurant went into designing the menu.   This place is ok, but just ok. There are far superior hibachi style restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I love wasabi, the japanese horseradish. I'm not quite as fond of the Japansese restaurant that carries its name.  Now that isn't to say that Wasabi is bad. It was my first trip and I split the Chef's Sushi for Two with my sister.  There was a selection of Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Octopus, White Tuna, Eel, California Roll and Tuna Roll.  All the fish were either nigiri or sashimi style with the exception, of course, of the rolls. It was plenty of food for two people but I felt that for something that is described as the best selections of the Chef that it was very run of the mill. If you go to a great sushi restaurant they push the boundaries of the above average sushi fan there was none of that in my meal.  That said, for 75%-80% of sushi eaters this place may be just fine for you.  For those of us who are more adventurous and have had sushi and some great places Wasabi isn't for you. Wasabi for me will end up on the list of places that I'll go if someone else wants to, but it will not be a place that I suggest."}
{"text":"If you're looking for dinner and a show all in one place, Wasabi is for you. If you've never been to a hibachi restaurant, I highly suggest going just for the experience. That being said, once is probably enough. The food is pretty good, but nothing to write home about. The staff is friendly and courteous and the entertainers/chefs do a bang-up job. I'll admit that the fake Asian stereotypes they act out make me a bit uncomfortable, but it's all in good fun. You will get a ton of food though so plan on having leftovers. I will say I'm not a fan of the styrofoam containers that they give you for leftovers and that they give each member of your party their own plastic shopping bag."}
{"text":"Food is excellent but the service is horrible. Called in for takeout, was hung up on twice and then it took 15 mins for the hostess to acknowledge me when I walked into the restaurant. The worst part? Another 15 mins to actually go check on my ordered food. Another person who ordered take out next to me experienced the same headache.   it wasn't busy (12 on a Sunday) but holy cow, talk about jumping through hoops to get yummy food!"}
{"text":"Service? We had to remind the waitress we were waiting for a table after bring told it would only take 15 minutes. After an hour we finally got seated only to find a new chef they were \"testing\" prepping to cook for us. His culinary skills consisted of adding large amounts if garlic to everything he cooked. So our meal tasted like garlic. The noodles, rice, vegetables and seafood all had the same flavor. Garlic. There was no show - the chef didn't speak English and didn't converse other than squirting saki in our mouths to the point of it dripping down faces and clothes. We missed out on knife and spatula flipping and spinning. Waste of money and time!! Don't go unless you are afraid of vampires - you will wreak of garlic for days and are assured they will avoid you."}
{"text":"Sushi is decent. Worth a try if you are in the area.  Gets busy and rowdy on the weekends. Lots of oohs and aahs coming from the hibachi area."}
{"text":"I had my first hibachi experience here this weekend. I waited about an hour and a half for a table and had high expectations coming in. The restaurant is very clean and modern looking. Everyone's plates at my table were greasy and had to be exchanged for new ones before we could eat though. I also got calamari as an appetizer which was below average.   My hibachi chef came out and was friendly and entertaining, squirting sake and throwing rice into our mouths. I got the triple combo which came with steak, chicken and shrimp. I did not expect there to be so much food. It was satisfying and left me quite full. Despite some cons, the hibachi tasted amazing and I had a pleasant experience. Wasabi is worth coming back to again."}
{"text":"Found a sushi place close by to the hotel I stay at.  Drinks were great and sashimi was amazing.  So fresh.  Just wish I knew what each fish was!"}
{"text":"If you think this is anything like other wasabi locations such as Independence or Montrose, you are seriously mistaken.  Appetizer Ordered a tuna tataki- see picture I posted. The tuna is old not even close the color it should of been. No way hell I was going to eat old raw fish. It seriously looked like it sat in water before serving and then doused it in sauce to cover it up.  We ordered three rolls that were at best \"ok\". King roll that was supposed to have seaweed salad inside really was lettuce. Top off this experience a Chinese chick was smoking in the corner...wtf!!!!  Get it together!!!!"}
{"text":"Nabataki udon and volcano roll. Beef roll around scallions and cheese. Edamame. Seated right away at the traditional dining area and it was pretty busy for a Sunday night. Service was good and waitress attentive. Food was great and I would come back again."}
{"text":"All these five star reviews raving about how good the food is here and I'm left with my head spinning thinking, did we eat at the same place?   As a disclaimer, I'm sort of a hibachi hater. The smell of grease that clings on you as you leave the restaurant and the over the top exhibitions to distract people from the fact that this is really just low quality take out food just make me cringe. I have had decent meals at hibachi restaurants in the past, but I really can't justify the price to recommend or prefer to return here.   For starters, if you come in on any weekend or special occasion you'll be hard pressed to find a table. This is no fault of the restaurant's, more just a warning for those ignorant folks who meander in on a Friday night at 7:00pm and are baffled that they can't get a table in under an hour. Plan ahead and make a reservation.   This place is comparable to other hibachi restaurants: 8-10 to a table, service split between the table server and the hibachi chef. For this reason, service may be a little slow. The server basically has to serve 8-10 people at a time, so be mindful of that with your patience meter. On our visit, our server was great in my opinion. It did take quite a bit of time to get refills on drinks but I don't think this was her fault per say. The hibachi chef was fine, he did all the obligatory hibachi \"tricks\" but he had probably served several tables before ours and you could tell he was just going through the motions. I am personally grossed out to see the food cooked in front of me, mostly because there just so much butter, salt and oil. This isn't high quality food for the price you're paying. At $20+ per person, the portions are great if you're a giant, but this is essentially marked up stir fry which you can get at any Chinese restaurant. I personally ordered sushi instead, which was equally disappointing. I can't see how anyone would consider this to be a high quality restaurant.   Overall, I think if hibachi is what you're after, you'll probably be really satisfied with Wasabi, but I wouldn't recommend Wasabi as a whole, either for the hibachi or for the sushi. I think it's incredibly overpriced for the quality of food, and after spending over $200 for a party of four, I can't help but think of all the other places I would have rather spent that money."}
{"text":"Love this place! We had such a great time! We opted for the hibachi the last time we visited and our chef didn't disappoint. He had us laughing the entire time. Not to mention the food was amazing! We will be back for sure!"}
