{"text":"This place kinda makes me go 'meh'.

The food is good, but not really great. It's not terribly expensive, but there weren't any great lunch deals either. If anything, it's a nice escape from the food court rush."}
{"text":"Great sushi for a decent price. Just make sure you go before the rush if you go at lunchtime. It fills up quickly!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I like their selection of boats, and their price is decent. The quality of their sushi has also never disappointed me, and service has been pretty decent, so I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"I'm sure I'm a fan of this place just because it's so close to work. If I want a decent sushi set at under $20 I go to Ninki. I don't think it's amazing enough that people who aren't working in downtown should actually make the drive but if you are in the area looking for sushi, this place is worth it."}
{"text":"I liket his place a lot because it is in my area and it serves up some fair cheap sushi.  Dont' get me wrong, it isn't amazing, but the price is definitely in the right zone.  Offering bento boxes and sushi combo sets for 10-15$ is right up my alley.  And they don't use excessive mayo or deep fry everything either (which is thumbs up for me).  For some reason sushi places in Toronto like to drown their sushi in mayo and deep fry everything. I think it's because of the lack of fresh fish.

anyway, it is better than average Japanese food at the right price.  And the place is clean and atmosphere very comfy.  The service is great and they have friendly staff and sushi chef's.
It is hands down the best sushi you can get within a 5 block radius of the financial district, I think.  And getting it to go is also nice since they don't stuff everything into styrofoam (I hate getting to-go in styro- \"death-to-the-earth\" -foam)

Try it.  It will result in pleasantries for your tummy and wallet."}
{"text":"This is pretty bad Japanese food which is not cheap either.
Initially I thought it was Chinese because it seemed like Chinese-style Japanese food, but then I heard the waitresses speak in Japanese.

Like someone else mentioned, it is extremely loud.
Well - perfect for bay street boys who spend their fat paycheques on bad Japanese food!
The person I was with was ordering everything off of the menu.  Like additional tempura, green tea ice cream.  I find that inconsiderate when someone else is paying.  Seriously, that is just bad etiquette.  Why he didn't just order an awful bento box was beyond me.  
No he gotta order a separate sushi, tempura and green tea ice cream.  So it was over $50.00 for 2 for lunch for awful Japanese food - only which 10.99 was mine.
Thanks!"}
{"text":"I guess I caught them on an off day?

Yuck.

Seriously bad.

No complimentary soup or tea, to start things off.

So loud you can't hear a thing.

PATH location leaves a lot to be desired.

I asked for a cranberry & soda and was informed it would be $5. WHAT? Settled for a diet coke, which was brought to the table in a can. That's classy. I had to ASK for a glass with ice. ICK.

THEN the food arrived.

My yam tempura appetizer MIGHT have been saved (as in, could have contributed to a second star) if the dipping sauce had ANY flavour whatsoever. Not so much... totally bland, sugary/watery and not even worthwhile dipping in. I tried putting some soy sauce in it so I could taste SOMETHiNG but that was a bit of a disaster too... not to mention bad etiquette at a business lunch. The tempura itself was marred by an inauthentic batter, more like fish & chips than true tempura. Plus it was soggy/soft, not crunchy. Total tempura fail.

My avocado maki had extra \"overhang\" or nori almost an inch or two long around it. That's just sloppy. Slimy and hard to chew. Nori wrap fail.

Nothing about this meal was enjoyable. Our server sucked - no English, and spoke quietly in the loudest establishment I've ever eaten in. Impossible to communicate = frustrating service. The atmosphere was terrible - crowded, no light, soooo loud. The food, well... you know already. Gross.

What a disappointment."}
{"text":"A solid little sushi place just south of the Eaton Centre/The Bay. Service is prompt and polite. The sushi is fresh and well prepared. I liked the miso soup has some textured tofu. The side salad has a nice dressing. Nothing really surprising here. The menu is pretty large, however. A great place for Queen Street west style sushi without having to jump on a street car and get to Queen & John."}
{"text":"Meh. It was expensive for what you get. New Generation is way better and cheaper"}
{"text":"Menu has a lot of items, I like that a lot. 

We ordered grilled squid and it was soooooooooo amazing. Loved it loved it.

I had the seaweed udon, which was great too. 

Our waitress was polite, tea always served, She gave us some spicy pepper thing, and it went very well with the miso soup. Sushi wasn't spectacular."}
