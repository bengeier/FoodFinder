{"text":"This place is absolutely great!..Truly authentic Hakka food and made to order. Great Service.and clean, hopr they keep up the great work."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this is our go to place for Haaka.  Always fresh always good.  I agree there is not much ambience, but it is clean, great service and really good food."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since for around 6/7 years now. Love the food! Its fresh and the portions are just right with the right price!   The staff is also very friendly, and the restaurant is kept clean.   My family loves hakka food and this is our go-to place!"}
{"text":"Owner says he's open until 10:00 but INFACT closes at 9:30 and has take out from then to 10:00. We went to this place since there was nothing else being that it was almost 10:00pm and places are closing. We told him we are from the states and we won't have anywhere to eat. He said it doesn't matter and that he's open for 13 hours. I did not understand why he had to say this because that wasn't our problem. We ended up ordering takeout and eating out of our car. The food was mediocre but we were hungry. We were also uncomfortable, and we might have enjoyed the food more inside the place. It was also understandable if no one was dining inside but there were two families still eating. I think the way the manager was acting was immature and I don't recommend this place to anyone after being treated like this."}
{"text":"I love the food. Amazing service.  Been there thrice  in 2 weeks. Once with 20 people....we were out of the restaurant in 45 minutes. Everyone loved the food and we already have plans to visit again.  Its easy on the pocket and good food.   The bill came out to only $200. Don't miss the Bombay Manchurian Chicken....its delicious"}
{"text":"Solid food, excellent prices. I can't wait to come back. Vegetarian selection was excellent."}
{"text":"Not tasty at all !! Order the chili chicken and it was so salty and noddle taste like a instant noodle.  Soup was okay and service is so so."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but so disappointed at the meat portions in any of their noodles and rice dishes as we were at the airport for a competition... asked me to pay for extra containers ( that should of been my hint ) give the people what they want at 12 $ a dish and maybe they'll be back ... apparently not !!"}
{"text":"Bunch of us wanted to have lunch at work but we couldn't leave so we ordered food in. The easiest and fastest was Hakka food. So I went with there Chilli Chicken option which comes with hot and sour soup or spring roll. The chicken was placed on top of the bed of rice and the taste was blend plus it wasn't spicy at all. The spring roll was ok but the hot n sour was not good at all.  For the price they charge, the quality justifies and show cases the cuts.     P.S. They serve halal food"}
{"text":"We went here last night after reading the reviews. We were a party of 6, so we tried many different dishes we didn't like anything but the soups. The food was tasteless and unimpressive. The place looked run down from outside. When we got there we were in dilemma whether to go-in or not, but we drove 30 km so we went in. The place was empty when we walked in.  The soups were good. We ordered a medium sweet corn and a medium Tom yum soup. Both were well liked by the group.  For the appetizers we ordered Spring roll, Hakka style chili potato and deep fried spicy cauliflower. The spring roll were A-OK. The chili potato and spicy cauliflower were very bland.  For the mains we had a chili fish (dry), szechuan chicken, pad thai with vegetable, vegetable chop suey, mixed vegetable with szechuan sauce.  Szechuan chicken sauce didn't have any taste or flavor. Chilli fish was very rubbery (seemed stale), pad thai with vegetable had tomato ketchup based sauce, vegetable chop suey was so sweet that it would have been more apt as a dessert than a main, mixed vegetable with szechuan sauce lacked any taste/flavour (just like szechuan chicken).  It was a horrible experience. We definitely won't return."}
{"text":"We decided to finally try out this restaurant about a month ago and since then, we've been back on at least a weekly basis!  The Hakka Chinese flavouring really stands out.  We've tried our fair share of Hakka Chinese cuisine in the area but nothing compares to the quality of their dishes here.  We're making it a point to sample the classic favourites as well as venture out with new dishes among their noodles, rice, seafood, chicken and beef entrees.  Favourites include General Tso chicken and sweet 'n sour fish.  Have not been disappointed so far.  Dine-in and take-out always efficient.  Staff remember returning faces and are always very friendly to us.  Our new go-to for Chinese food!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Indian Chinese cuisine ever! Their vegetarian dishes are simply amazing and full of taste. The large portions of food make it worth paying $6-$9 per item ordered. My favourite dishes include the hot and sour soup, vegetable fried rice, manchurian vegetable (pakora style), and the hakka vegetable chow mein noodles. The only change I would suggest is for the fortune cookies served at the end of the meal to be eggless or to serve mints at the end (i.e. something vegan-friendly)."}
{"text":"If you are looking for cheap Hakka that tastes pretty good, this is the place for you. For $9 their lunch special comes with a soup and a spring roll and the portion size of the meal is perfect. Friendly Service and a clean establishment (a bit dated but that's just being nit picky). I'll definitely come back for lunch if I'm in the area"}
{"text":"I love finding little gems like this place on Yelp. As other reviewers said it looks petty dumpy outside that my husband almost did not want to come in. But nice inside and really enjoyed our Manchurian Chicken and the Green Curry Chicken. Delish! Even ordered their Famous Crispy Sesame Beef to go. We are from out of town but will be back next time we come to the Convention Centre on Airport Rd. It's right around the corner."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! This place is surrounded by restaurants but what it lacks in size it makes up for in quality and service.  Very nice ambiance and a waterfall near the bar area. We visited for lunch and the service was immediate.  I ordered the red Thai curry which was delicious. It was sweet and savoury and the right portion size. The lunch special came with an egg roll or soup. Lunch came up to $10.20 with tax!! How can you go wrong.  I like supporting smaller restaurants and if you give it a chance I am sure you will enjoy their food too! Not many places you can dine in and have lunch for far less that $20!  Service is very prompt and friendly. Two servers managing the floor. Dinning room fills quickly.  Will definitely visit again :)"}
{"text":"I went there for the 1st time for lunch. We were attended to right away. The lady/server was very warm and immediately seated us and gave us Menus. We ordered  Hakka Manchurian veg chowmein , Cantonese fish fry and masala chicken chowmein. The food was pretty decent! It probably wasn't the best, but pretty good. It wasn't too spicy, but there Was hot sauce present for us to add heat! The only criticism I have if that there were enough vegetables in the chowmein. The hostess had a good idea how to take a good care of customers. We were looked after well. Over all, good food, great customer service, decent ambience."}
{"text":"Good place for indian hakka. For me chilli chicken is the best dish with manchurian rice. Service is just about ok. Overall food is good."}
{"text":"We recently came here on a weekday and ordered off the lunch special. The waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about all the dishes. I had Shrimp with Lobster Sauce - it was fresh and eatable but I found that it lacked seasoning (salt in particular) and the temperature could have been hotter. My friend said her Tandoori Chicken was extremely salty and the chicken had a bit of a mushy texture but I think that's because they use dark meat in mostly all their chicken dishes. My other friend ordered the Spicy Thai Green Curry Chicken and absolutely loved it.  I don't know if I would go out of my way to return as my dish was just average. As another reviewer mentioned, the portion sizes are a lot smaller than many of its competitors. I usually always seem to have leftovers but I ate every scrap of my lunch.   I think 3.5 stars is a fair rating from me."}
{"text":"Not bad at all! They've been open for 5 yrs under 2km from my house and I never went there:( tried the basics Chilli Chicken and Chicken Manchurian. Soup needed almost the entire packet of soya. While it was done nicely. I'd have preferred more flavour. Incl Salt. The chilli chicken though... Mmmm yes that's how it's done! Beautiful flavour, nice an crispy outside with warm and soft deliciousness inside. Good amount of chicken as well with a hint of veggies! It's a little spicy I'm warning you before hand! The outside needs a major revamp! The interior is not bad actually! Simple an nice. New go to Hakka place close to the house!"}
{"text":"Good place for Chinese/ Hakka cuisine. The atmosphere could use a little pick me up; however, the food is very flavourful.  The server was very attentive with portions large enough to be shared. I ordered the garlic fish and it was very flavourful."}
{"text":"This was absolutely fantastic. Great food for a very reasonable price. Very friendly staff too. The place doesn't look like much, but that was some very good Chinese food that puts American Chinese food to shame. If I'm ever around this area, I'd happily come back here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for a few years now. My boyfriend and I used to work close by to this restaurant, so it was convenient.  We would bring clients to this restaurant, too. Why do we go back often? The quality of the food is authentic and delicious. Each time we are there, we have our usual dishes that we love to eat, and the flavour is consistent.  I love the Hakka chicken fried noodles and lemon chicken. My boyfriend loves all the spicy dishes, especially the spicy ginger chicken.  Unfortunately, our workplace moved to the other side of the airport. As a result, it takes us longer to drive there. We have had to abandon going there for lunch, but we both long to visit this restaurant.  We decided to go there for dinner last Friday. We haven't been there for a year. We walked in. Immediately, everyone remembered us and welcomed us back as if we were family. Mary, who works there, always remembers my name, which is nice!  We both agreed that we should come back for dinner here more often. The food just tastes better than the Chinese/Hakka restaurants that are close to our workplace."}
{"text":"Hakka food in the Mississauga area is pretty common. For those who are not familiar with this style of cooking it is basically an adaption of Chinese food with Indian flavours. The dishes are Chinese-based however they use a selection of spices found commonly in Indian food. Lots of cilantro, green chilies, tumeric, and garam masala.   Chopstick is one of three places located within about a 500 meter radius and in my opinion they're the best of the three. The location is clean and the service is great even during the busy airport employee (of which I'm part of) rush. I am partial to their Butter Chicken and Tandoori Chicken, both of which are quite different than what you'd get at an Indian restaurant. If you like spicy food Chopstick Cuisine won't disappoint. They also have a variety of vegetarian and milder dishes on the menu. For $6.99 you can get one of many very filling lunch specials cooked fresh, a spring roll, and a soup or soda.   They use halal meat but still serve alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, I decided to stop in Chopstick Cuisine for lunch. Their lunch special seemed to be competitive in terms of price and had at least 20 options to choose from.   I always order the chili chicken at a new hakka place to get a real barometer of how I will end up liking their food. To me, there was not enough chicken in the dish. A few more pieces would have been fine. Also, the sauce could have been a lot more flavourful. I mean, its called \"chilli\" chicken.   Will return and try it one more time, maybe they just had an off day."}
{"text":"taste good, but half a portion on lunch special when theres a million haka competition around you that gives decent sizes will lose majority of working class in that area that are hungry"}
{"text":"I found this place and went twice in 3 days. First time was  stars and second 3 stars. Its as if there was a different cook both times. The first time was just amazing food. Finally another hakka place to our usual. The second time we took our staff of 20 and it seemed not as spicey and tasty as the first. Still not bad but I was expecting the same. I will give it another try in the future when I am in Toronto and see what the results are."}
{"text":"I went here since I was already picking up someone from the airport anyway.  My friend told me their crispy beef is close to what I got at Chung King.  Anyway the food here in terms of portions of what you get and the price is pretty good.  You can get away with under $10 per person and be moderately full.  The service was good, though somewhat rushed.  So it's a good place for quick office lunches, but felt a bit too fast paced to enjoy your food.  We had mapo tofu, butter chicken masala and crispy Szechuan beef combos .  Each combo came with soup and a spring roll with noodles or rice.  The noodles, spring rolls and the chicken corn soup were pretty good considering the environment and price.  The spice they used on the mapo tofu feels a bit low quality.  Like it's watered down and starched up.  So it was pretty much disappointing as a main.  So I doubt I would get it again.  The butter chicken masala has a strong tomato base and I didn't feel much of the buttery goodness like I normally get at India Sweets.  So I doubt I would get it again.  The crispy Szechuan beef is quite good.  I have to admit it is close to the one at Chung King.  Though, I still prefer the flavoring of Chung King if I had to make a choice.  I'd still come here with friends, or if I need a quick AND CHEAP Chinese fix and I need to be near the airport (as Sam Woo is much further away)."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the hot and sour soup which was awesome. Followed with the shrimp Hakka chowmein which tasted just perfect. The gravy chilli chicken also tasted fine. I would want to go for the lunch specials ... Overll good experience"}
