{"text":"Convenience is, indeed, the only reason to go here.  There are a surprising (surprised me, at least) lack of Mexican places within walking distance of this part of downtown Phoenix.  I work in the area, so I end up eating here once a month or so because I've been to the spots around it an exhaustive number of times, or I just really want some beans and rice on a particular day.

Said beans and rice are acceptable but don't rise above that level.  The entrees are meh.  I usually get the tacos because, again, they're generally acceptable if not great.  Like many I found service to be slow and, given that the sub-Filiberto's fast quality of what you get, I don't see any excuse for that.  It's never been particularly busy when I've gone in, so it wasn't that the staff were horribly pressed, either.

You can do better, is the bottom line, but if you REALLY want Mexican on a particular day, El Portal is...there."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and last time I went the service was AWFUL. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I used to come here on Tuesday's for grad school after I got tired of the neighboring meal options. I always got a chicken quesadilla and on two different occasions I had bone in my quesadilla. The first was more annoying that harmful, but the second time I was absolutely awestruck. How do you not notice a chicken bone that size? It was also sharp and I feel lucky that I was not hurt. See my picture and you'll understand why I have never been back."}
{"text":"I am a student at ASU and have given El Portal many chances, because it is one of the only restaurants downtown that accepts ASU dollars. However, I am an Arizona native, born and raised eating authentic Mexican food, and this food can not even compare. I expected it to at least match up to Filibertos, and it fails miserably. I never thought it possible to screw up a bean and cheese burrito, but with almost no flavor, El Portal managed that. They don't even have green chili sauce! The Breakfast Burrito specialls are only 1.99, but fast food breakfast places have better breakfast burritos than this. The service is also almost always slow. HATE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"I eat here every week. The bean and cheese burrito and the quesadilla are my favorites. The staff is friendly and the food comes out quick, which is nice for my breaks between classes."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that is just convenient for me. It's so-so. The service is slow. I kind of like their beans and the red enchilada sauce. I would never go out of my way to eat here. In fact, I'm not sure why I eat here, but I do sometimes. Don't judge me."}
{"text":"I've visited El Portal about seven or eight times because of its reasonably priced food and proximity to the journalism school. But the food is so-so and the service has ranged from terrible to OK. 

El Portal has cheap daily specials. The portions are huge. Make sure to indicate what kind of meat you want in your food. They normally didn't ask me.

The seating area is spacious and they have a TV. 

The service is lacking, but I think they're trying to work on it. But don't expect them to stay open until their posted hours. The cashier once told me they close shop 30 minutes before closing time if there aren't any customers."}
{"text":"I have been to El Portal multiple times and I really am not sure why.  I think it has to do with the fact that there aren't a ton of options within a 2 minute walk of work.

I try to go at slightly off hours to avoid the lunchtime rush and at least haven't had any issues with service, although a good number of the tables usually seem pretty filthy and haven't been wiped off.  

The food is pretty bland and uninteresting.  I usually get a couple enchiladas, and the sauce, beans, rice, everything, just kind of melds together into a one-note bland mess.  I guess I shouldn't be expecting much though when the food is so cheap.  I guess that's a positive.  One time the rice was under cooked and crunchy...I still ate it.

Unless you are starving, want Mexican food (if you can call it that) and are within a 2 minute walk I don't really see a reason to go here.  Unfortunately, I seem to meet those 3 criteria every now and then."}
{"text":"This place is the worst! First of all, the person taking my order was so awkward it made me feel uncomfortable. Next I ordered the wednesday special which is rolled beef tacos (beef or chicken, your choice) with rice and beans for $4.99 and i asked to substitute the rice and beans for chips. When my order came, they forgot the chips which isn't a big deal I just went back up to the register and asked for some. Then as i started to eat, I noticed they gave me chicken instead of beef. I was kind of disappointed but i had class soon and didn't want to wait for them to make another order so I got over it. Then as i was eating i choked on a CHICKEN BONE! It was horrible!! a chicken bone in a rolled taco?! I was so mad, I left. Never going there again! STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Super inexpensive - Lightning quick service - great people. cheek out the Mary-Rose special (calabasitas). It was AWESOME"}
{"text":"For the love of god, would someone open a Berto's of some kind downtown? I will literally give you a million dollars. I will do it $6 at a time in exchange for delicious carnitas burritos and so will thousands of others.

El Portal was sortof el crappy. The service was lackluster and the food meh.

\"I think we are out of carne asada. Yeah we are out of carne asada.\"

How does that happen? Then the green chili was sortof a greenish mush of blahness and no one trained them to wrap a burrito.

I also got a quesadilla which promptly leaked yellow tinged grease onto my pants from boring yellow cheese in a boring tortilla. 

I also hate a tip line on a receipt from a place where you order your food at the counter and pick it up at the counter and fill your own drinks. 

And why did everyone else have real plates while mine was a Dixie?

Subway is next door."}
{"text":"Like the food, the prices and, especially, the service. The salsa is quite good. The red chili burro is a great deal."}
{"text":"I went here once or twice never again will i go the beans were not good they were cold felt.sick.after.i ate...."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would.

I came in here hoping to prove most os the yelp reviews wrong, boy did that not work out.

I ordered a Chorizo and egg burrito.  First off, there were barely any eggs in it, unless their eggs are brown.  Second, this might have been the greasiest thing I have ever eaten.  I could barely pick the thing up without it leaking juice from the bottom.  Finally it tasted like absolutely nothing.  It literally tasted they just threw in cardboard and grease in a tortilla.  Awful!

Also about an hour after eating it, my stomach felt awful afterwards.  I had the worst stomach ache until I used the bathroom.  

All in all, subway is right next door to this place.  You'd be much better off going there.   

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"}
{"text":"This food is always fresh and very tasty. Everything is authentic. Try the carne asada tacos or the burrito. It's huge."}
{"text":"I waited almost twenty minutes for a potato and egg burrito so naturally I'm already a little bothered because it shouldn't take that long. Specially if there is one person ahead of me. I asked the cashier if the potatoes were French fries or real cut potatoes to which he said they were real potatoes. Well I guess he doesn't know the difference because I didn't get potatoes.  The burrito was over 5 bucks and I didn't even get cheese (it's okay because I don't like it but feel bad for you that does like cheese !) I asked how much a can of soda was and he said 1.30something. The place is over priced, wait is too long and food is not even good. Yes, I did eat it because I was hungry! I would not go back."}
{"text":"What in the world happened here?? This place used to be good, with the usual and expected full menu of American-ized Mexican takeout food, including beef, chicken, pork and other options in tacos, burritos, tostadas, enchiladas. Today, their only choices are beef or bean. That's a weird choice (or lack of choices) for a Mexican Grill like this. On top of that, they don't accept M&G (the currency used by ASU students who have meal plans), their CO2 was out so their soda fountain wasn't working, they had no bottled  water and the water cup I was offered never materialized. The decor is lacking (practically non-existent), and this place doesn't deserve another try. Sadly, I suspect they'll be closed and replaced by something more appropriate for the traffic in due time!"}
{"text":"I went downtown to meet my husband on his lunch break for a quick bite to eat. He wanted subway (which mind you is right next store). I said hey lets check out this place, i can get some nachos...... well i was wrong. The nachos i ordered came with loads of meat and fake cheese. And here you go.. Wait what? I order nachos... taco bell nachos are better than this. I'm at a so called Mexican Grill? and the employee in the front did not say its just cheese and chicken. I went to front and took it back got a refund. She asked if i wanted it remade i decline it ruined my appetite. 

They need to re-do the menu ASAP."}
{"text":"This is not Mexican food. Safe yourself the trip and money and just head to Filibertos. Here is the nearest location:Address: 209 N 24th St, Phoenix, AZ 85034
This place is too expensive. If your looking to just get a regular bean and cheese burrito and add some extras well get ready to pay at least $2.00 per extra you want on the burrito. If you think this is Mexican food, then you are really cheating yourself."}
{"text":"This place really doesn't even deserve a star at all, I don't know why this place is still open. It doesn't feel like a Mexican restaurant one bit, Taco Bell food tastes better then this place. And the prices a marked up because there isn't any other Mexican food around the area. It's 4 dollars for a bean and cheese burrito and it's the smallest 4 dollar burrito I've ever seen. There is no creativity, no uniqueness to the food and I would rather there be a Taco Bell in this spot then this place, I think ASU Students deserve better prices and better tasting food. Put a Taco Bell in or even better a filibertos!!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst tasting food ever in the valley. I wouldn't spend another dime in that filthy place. The owners are inconsiderate anti-police. When the fat owner was shot in the ass who did she call the police. The only reason I gave this place One star was you had to rate it in order to post it"}
{"text":"Every 5 months or so I end up here, not because I really want to but because I don't have time to go somewhere else better.  Each time I eat here it reminds me of why I avoid it in the first place.  

I've tried several things on the menu and basically everything is horrible.  By far the worst thing is their rice.  Its a real problem for a Mexican place when I (who is not Mexican) makes better Mexican rice than they do.  It is oily, without any flavor and today it was undercooked - meaning it was still hard.  Disgusting.  

Its a real shame that a place like Carolina's isn't in this location - you know a place that actually makes enjoyable food.  

Do yourself a favor and make the drive to Carolina's or El Commadore, but if you don't have time for that, grab a microwave burrito at the Circle K and it will be better than this place."}
{"text":"You know you're in for a bad time when the cashier looks at you confused when you ask for Cholula or hot sauce. Worst tacos I've had in a while. Should have Yelped this joint prior to coming. Blerg."}
{"text":"Updated look!  Food is awesome. Give them a try if you haven't already. They installed an ice tea dispenser!  Service is good. Food is very tasty and good sized portions. Price is right! Two cheese enchilada, beans, rice, small side salad for less than six bucks. You can't beat that!!! 

I love seeing this place busier and busier each week."}
{"text":"Expensive.  
I understand that this place is in a college campus building. Thus the need your reaction is for the owner to jack the prices up to the roof because they think they have a captive audience.  However, this place is ridiculous.

The food isn't that amazing. They don't even offer ground beef option on their tacos."}
{"text":"El Portal just reopened their 117 West Grant  location and it has a great atmosphere and the food is great! Mom loved the Caldo de Camarones and Calabacitas. I had the #1 taco and enchilada plate and my boyfriend loved the green chile burrito. Sis enjoyed the Chiliquiles. They serve breakfast and lunch. Open hours 8-3 pm daily. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you own a Mexican restaurant, how on earth can you mess up beans?!?  

There's nothing worse than going to a Mexican restaurant and their beans have no flavor WHAT-SO-EVER.  To add to my disappointment, the chicken tacos I ordered were saturated with grease and lacked flavor too.  

I hope the owner reads this because she needs to have the cook taste the food he's preparing before they serve it.  Salt is your friend! Maybe even some pepper and garlic if you're adventurous.  

Thank God for the little bit of salsa they gave me, it was the only thing to make my tacos edible.  I ended up tossing the frijoles in the garbage.  What a waste of food!"}
{"text":"I never was a big fan of the original El Portal other than for it's Democratic party people watching.  But a friend and I went here today for a quick lunch and, to my surprise, it was pretty good.  Everything at the original El Portal always seemed too \"saucy\" for me.  That was not the case here.  The sauce was appropriate in quantity and not drowning the food.  It does have a college eatery vibe and is set up like a fast food place, but that makes for a quick meal without sitting around waiting for a waiter (the parking meters nearby only allow 1 hour, so the quick service was much appreciated).  One complaint is that they did not give us very many chips at all (maybe 5 each) so we had to actually go ask for more and got another small amount.  Chips are cheap and should be plentiful in my opinion.  As for main courses, my friend had some enchiladas and I had the veggie burro, which against all reason, I requested chimichanga style.  That meant it was deep fried and then smothered with guacamole and sour cream.  Yumm. I can't eat that way on a daily basis, but after a long morning in court, it definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"El Hefe and I were initially on our way to the fleet of food trucks but then discovered our days were off. Food Trucks are on Wednesdays and today was Tuesday. What a mixer-roo! 

El Portal would have to do, an unfortunate to do at that.

The service is deplorable! The counter expediter was a hot mess. He even addressed me as \"Hey You\" when my order was ready.  Seriously, what the \"Number 2\" is up with that?!  The gals that were behind us in line were treated with an even lower grade of service. Now that didn't make me feel special at all.  

I ordered the two (chicken) taco combo and only one taco contained any meat product.  I left hungry.

No bueno: ("}
{"text":"When you get the simplest mexican foods to taste similar to cardboard, you are doing something quite wrong.  Perhaps, grease isn't a seasoning? 

Pretty much the only thing going for this place is its location in the bottom of ASU's Cronkite School downtown."}
{"text":"I happened to walk in on my way to the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism.  The service was very, very helpful and the red burrito was wonderful. Low prices."}
{"text":"I was hoping this casual Mexican place in ASU's Cronkite School of Journalism building would be a good find for lunch downtown.  Uh, nope.  The carne asada burrito I ordered that was supposed to be \"served with guacamole and pico de gallo\" was just some under-seasoned beef chunks in a flour tortilla.  The guac and salsa was  only available in their salsa bar.  Really disappointing.  I won't be back.  Is there a Taco Bell nearby?"}
{"text":"The only plus about this place is that it's convenient. Other than that, it sucks. The first time I went here will definitely be my last.

The food is sub-par, even for a fast food place. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was a sloppy mess. Some slices had wayyy too much chicken and in some there were barely any slices. And I couldn't tell if the chicken was really even chicken. It was very rubbery. I can get better quesadillas for way cheaper.

The atmosphere is very cheap. There are generic tables and stools, one soda machine, and then there are plastic barrels of different fruit juices. It actually looks like an incomplete restaurant. And the way the fruit juices are served is questionable. The cashier takes a soup ladle and pours the drink into a cup, then wipes the ladle with a generic kitchen towel. Not hygienic at all.  

The service is slow. There was only one cashier and one cook working when I went there, and this was during lunch hour. I waited 15 minutes for my food, which I had ordered to-go. 

Just don't go here. There are better places close by."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how this place stays in business. It can't be cheap rent! I first went here a few years ago. I asked if the beans were vegetarian (no meat/lard) and they said yes, so I got a bean burrito (no cheese). It was okay. Just servicable. I tried it again a few months later. Same thing, but a little worse taste (I couldn't finish it). On the third attempt, when asked if the beans were veg, the counter person said no, they have some form of meat. Sigh. So I just got chips and salsa. The chips and salsa were actually quite good - fresh, spicy salsa and my favorite consistency (not pico like). The chips were thin corn chips, warmed and just fine. I've been sticking with chips and salsa since. Today, I ordered chips and salsa and was given a container of what seemed to me to be fried pieces of flour tortillas. They were inedible. How do you mess up corn chips? Really? Either they changed from my last visit, or they ran out of corn chips and fried up some flour tortillas instead. The salsa was still good, but, seriously? 

The service has never been a problem - always friendly and fast. It's usually never crowded (actually, usually empty), so it's an easy go-to if you are in the area. It might be better for carnivores, but not recommended for veg/vegan diners. I may give them one more try just to see if the tortillas were a fluke, but only if I'm starving. The second star is only for the salsa."}
{"text":"Quaint little Mexican restaurant in central Phoenix. I came here on a Friends recommendation. Outgoing and friendly wait staff. All family. Somewhat limited menu but all the classics are here. My wife and I come here for lunch now at least once a week. I haven't been disappointed. We will be back."}
{"text":"I am in Phoenix for a conference and was looking for huevos  Rancheros for breakfast. No one was open but I found El Portal opened at 9:30. Perfect. Ended up ordering chalupa...shell stayed crispy, veggies were fresh, salsa just spicy enough. Free chip too. Easy walk off Central"}
{"text":"Best chicken taco salad ever.  Friendly service and very clean. I highly recommend this place for lunch.   Very good food."}
{"text":"Food is ok.  I have had the chicken enchiladas a few times.  Today only one cook at the busiest time of the day.  15 minute wait for food.  Not a good thing."}
{"text":"Very pleasant atmosphere, given quick service Mexican food is on the menu. 

Excellent vegetarian options. I don't know if this is a franchise or a chain - there's a terrific El Portal in San Diego (Clairemont area.)
 
Chips and salsa and my combo plate (grilled vegetables) were delicious. The beans and rice were tasty. The staff is attentive even though it's quick-serve. 
CNN was on the TV - so sitting and eating @ El Portal was a nice break from all day meetings on the 3rd floor of ASU's Cronkite building.

Very convenient eating option if you're near ASU's downtown campus. Healthy dishes are on the menu, comfortable environment if you want to sit for a bit. Service is friendly and fast. They evidently now take ASU $$ (campus meal plan/points?) So I hope that ASU students will support this business.

Will eat at El Portal again on my next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I think this place is average at best. A little over priced for fast food Mexican.  I ordered a cheese enchilada and it didn't hardly have any cheese in it. I also ordered a side of sour cream which was a $1 and it was like a tablespoon in a small cup. This place is ok I've just had better fast Mexican food."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying this review is about my experiences at El Portal twice in the last three weeks. Judging from the other reviews here and the signage at this location, I think they closed down this location and reopened recently. So, this review reflects their more recent opening. 

Both times I went was for a work lunch meeting. To my surprise, this place was not crowded at all, even when I went during lunch hour. It is a hole in the wall restaurant in downtown Phoenix and it's easy to get lost in the area if you don't have the GPS on. I later learned that this place is very popular among politicians, as it is discrete enough and do not seem to attract the crowd. The two times I went, during lunchtime on a weekday, the other customers here were local politicians or belong to organizations and seem to meet here frequently (I didn't know this personally having only lived in Phoenix for less than a year, but my colleagues told me). 

Now, for the actual FOOD. I've gotten the #2 (chicken taco and tostado with rice and beans) and #11 (2 chicken enchiladas with rice, beans & tortilla) from the lunch menu. The chicken taco was alright; nothing too memorable and honestly lacked some flavor. The rice and beans were on point though, which almost compensates for the taco. The #11 was delicious! The enchiladas came out fresh and warm. I'd probably order this again if I come back.

The service has been great. The servers are super friendly and helpful, tho some seem a little shy and not too knowledgeable about the menu when we've asked questions. There's a few parking spots outside the restaurant, and plenty of street parking. Overall, I think El Portal is decent and I'd come back again!"}
{"text":"How does this place still exist? The food is awful. You can get better Mexican food at Taco Bell.  I have also never seen more than one person in this place at a time. ASU needs to get rid of this restaurant and put in something that students may actually like."}
{"text":"So bad, I must have been really hungry to eat here. Ordered the #2. (This is what THEY call it, so you would think that would be easiest on them to remember, right?) Delivered a #1 instead, that looked like a #2 on the plate, and tasted even worse.(Couldn't even get that right).  Beginning with the unidentifiable, grey, completely void of any taste, mystery meat contained in my taco, to the scarce trace of ANY filling whatsoever in my enchilada, the burnt tostada shell, the cold, stale, generic, tortilla chips and watered-down, thin, red-colored, pathetic lame excuse for salsa, was just about all I could take without wanting to chuck it all right back at them. Absolutely, without exception, the worst dining experience I have ever had the displeasure of having. Deserves whatever happens to them. No excuse for this."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you want throw your food away after the first bite.  I ordered the carne asada with beans, rice and guacamole.  The burrito was pure meat, no cheese, beans, exc. inside.  The shell broke apart right away, I wasn't even able to pick it up, the meat was cooked to a leather consistency and had no seasoning.  The rice was not fully cooked and tasted like cardboard, the beans were the best tasting out of all the food, but I would rate it a c- and that was probably because it tasted like lettuce since there was more of that than the beans itself.  The guacamole was more like colored sour cream and the chips were bland with no salt or seasonings on them.  With how horrible my meal was I'm surprised at how busy it was ( My guess is that it must be better than cafeteria food for the freshmen in the res. halls.)"}
{"text":"I love this place! I can eat here alone, with hubby for a date or the entire family and everyone is satisfied! The Chilaquiles are the bomb, it's served with eggs, potatoes & tortilla. Everyone loved their plates, pancakes, bacon, sausage & beans all delicious! The bacon is nice and crispy. They know how to take care of their customers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Small place , was clean and the service was fast. Tried the number 2 which is a taco ( beef or chicken ) , tostado and beans and rice. I had the beef taco it was a fairly standard taco as was the rest of the plate. If you want some average Mexican food with no frills but at a decent price this place is not too bad."}
{"text":"Ordered a burrito and the meat tasted like the stuff you get canned, salsa tastes pizza sauce and it was quite small for 7.00 . I think it is safe to say I will not be going back."}
{"text":"In town stumbled upon this place. I had the enchilada/taco plate and it was great but lite. So great that I had the flavorful carne asada burro that took me over the top."}
{"text":"\"Beans are Money\"

Just opened yesterday, the new El Portal is nestled inside the Walter Cronkite building of Jounalism in the downtown ASU campus.

food is as awesome as the location down on Grant. more of a quick service atmosphere. gonna make this my go to mexican joint because its well within walking distance."}
