{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when I walked into the pretty little pink box but the idea of drip coffee was pulling me in. What I found in the pretty pink box has me addicted. A simple menu of mini donuts that are so fresh and so delicious, I found myself saying \"Tiny Tom, who?!\" All paired with a delicious drip coffee that I was pleased to find they can do in decaf for me as well. Already addicted and will be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely, an interesting little coffee shop made in this little pink box building. They do a strong dip coffee and you can taste the pure taste of the coffee made. The tiny donuts are super yummy! They have two benches in the inside you can sit on, and some pretty cool music playing in the background that you don't typically hear in a coffee shop. But it's more of a place to grab and go, which is why I put 4-star. Unfortunately, there aren't any restrooms inside. But!!!!! It's definitely a place a would tell people to come visit to try out, a little small but here this small treat is definitely worth having a bite and drink. A place to return to for sweet customer service."}
{"text":"I love Baddies, but Cops Treats is a huge disappointment. These donuts are terrible. Overfried, oily, greasy, just not good. While I do like Tiny Tom's, I've previously reviewed Little Nicky's and Fugo as middling at best. Well, Cops is the worst yet. Little greasy balls of yuck. Cinnamon sugar didn't have enough topping, while \"sour cherry almond glaze\" tastes like absolutely nothing. Coffee was terrible, so acidic that even 4 sugars and a ton of cream barely made it drinkable. Strawberry milk was unavailable, at opening on Saturday. Place is adorable though so I'm sure everyone will go there anyway. A word of warning to parents - the \"shelf\" by the window and the mirror on the wall are not secure! Shelf almost fell down when a women put her bag there, mirror was precariously wobbling when a child was on the bench below. For a place that seemingly caters to kids, they should really work on child proofing the place. Ugh. Can't recommend anything here except photos against the cute exterior."}
