{"text":"I can't imagine a better treat than the custard tarts from Venezia. They're perfect. At 4 for $6, I would pay double."}
{"text":"Try they carrot cake, it is tasty. We get one every week and always fresh. Great bakery."}
{"text":"I dropped by this cafe randomly while walking through Little Portugal, since just being there had me craving a pastel de nata. Oooooh was I glad I did. It was the absolute best pastel de nata I've found in Toronto, and I confess I've eaten a lot of them. But there's more! After that first delicious reminder of my life in Portugal, I had to ask for a rissol de camarao as well (a shrimp croquette). Mmm mmm, it was just exactly the taste you'd get in a cafe in Lisbon - this is the real deal, delicious and totally authentic. If you're craving a snack-sized taste of Portugal, sweet or not, this is definitely your spot."}
{"text":"Compact casual authentic Portuguese bakery with a large variety of pastries and loaves of bread and savory baked items. Ordered the egg, almond, bean, beer and other tarts. Discovered that the egg tarts are very different from the Portuguese egg tarts sold in Macau. The crust is very thin and flaky and the custard is extremely rich."}
{"text":"The custard tart is good but the service is really bad. They didn't give a shit at all."}
{"text":"Wandered into this bakery while waiting for a show at Lower Ossington Theatre to start. So glad I got sucked in by the array of sweets I could see from the window. A man who sat near the counter with a newspaper recommended we should try the custard tarts and assured us we couldn't have just one. Well, he was right! Creamy filling with just the right hint of sweetness and a flaky fillo pastry crust/tart shell. I also had a slice of cheesecake, which was creamy with a crumbly/cookie dough-like crust...so many more items to try, but I think the custard tarts are worth coming here alone, even if it's a bit of a trek."}
{"text":"The Portuguese Natas are amazing very flaky and yummy. The cod fish cakes are a bit dry and not enough cod. Worth the trip for the Natas"}
{"text":"Venezia Bakery an old school staple in the trendy Ossington strip and I like its character.  It's a full bakery but the tarts are why I visit.  These are the best pasteis de natas I've had in town.  The custard is creamy and Goldilocks-like sweet, the pastry is flaky and light, and the combination together is heavenly.    It's difficult to stop at just one."}
{"text":"Venezia's tarts are very good and I'll often come here when I'm too lazy to go all the way up to College (the best are at National Portuguese Bakery on College--the texture is just like Belem in Portugal). The ladies here are very friendly and I enjoy just sitting with a coffee watching out the window. The only sad thing is that even though they use Delta coffee (which is a lovely Portuguese coffee) the lattes are bitter. I can only guess that they are over-extracting it somehow on the espresso machine, as I've had the same coffee elsewhere and it's beautiful."}
{"text":"A very comfortable and \"homey\" bakery on a street bursting with expensive, gentrified eateries!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Portuguese Egg Tarts alone (i.e. Pasteis De Natas) as it's the only thing I get from this place. Although, I'm sure their other items are just as good.  If you haven't tried a Pasteis De Natas from Venezia bakery, then you owe it to yourself to go there as fast as possible to try one. Sooooo good...definitely one of the best I've had in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Siiiiiiigh. I don't see what all the hype was about. I bought some of their famous custards and was left unimpressed. No complaints about the texture - nice and flaky against the thick, creamy custard. However, the taste was nothing to write home about. It was too sweet and lacked any sort of distinct taste. The lady was very nice however, and does deserve some recognition for her great service. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll try a different pastry, as they do have quite a few."}
{"text":"Palmiers - 5/5 (very flakey and lightly sweetened)  Portugese egg tarts - 5/5 (filling was very creamy and smooth with a caramelly flavoured top... the pastry was flakey)  Lemon custard topped - 5/5 (lemon topping was very flavourful...used real lemons)  Chocolate Donut - 4/5 (crispy and fresh)  Carrot cake - 1/5 (Awful...was made with real carrots but, it tasted like the cardboard. Was very dry and flavourless...I was very surprised considering the quality of their other pastries. The only reason why this received a 1/5 was because the crust tasted pleasant...only ate the crust and gave the rest to my dogs...)"}
{"text":"I love the Palmiers here, flakey sweet perfection, nicely crunchy and not greasy. The Portuguese egg tarts are also lovely here. They are not too sweet and light, even my husband who does not have a sweet tooth likes the tarts here. The lady behind the counter is always friendly. They also have a little convenience store like appendage attached to the bakery where you can buy risotto rice and other food items. The cakes and everything looks wholesome and has a homemade feel here, but I mainly come for the palmiers and egg tarts."}
{"text":"Today was my first time here.  The service was great - an old school dedication to the customer!!  I had the veal sandwich, which I took home and heated in the oven later.  It was delicious.  We also tried two different pastries: their homemade donut with cinnamon sugar, and the raspberry, cream cheese strudel-like pastry.  Both were beyond scrumptious!!  I will go out of my way to return!!!"}
{"text":"I ADORE this bakery.  \"Beer\" or Portuguese egg tarts are unbelievably incredible. Flaky, Dense, Custardy, Caramelized and slightly sweet all at once. At a little over $1.00 a piece, and in regular or coconut they are well worth the trip west.   Stopped in before an event the other night with Rob B. and Patty H. I needed tarts (of course) and Patty wanted something sweet to bring home to the husband.  So worth the stop.   Lovely cream filled pastries, fresh loaves and beautiful homemade pies (apple, cherry, blueberry) baked fresh for $5.99 are of tremendous value.   Run by friendly Portuguese ladies, you can take a seat and enjoy your indulgence in peace.   Definitely the place I recommend for treats like this. Really really good."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch on a Wed afternoon, looking for something savoury as well as a bakery item for dessert.  Cons: No interac on orders under $10 The ladies behind the counter were rude and neglectful  The pizza slice I ordered (I only had $3 in cash on me at the time) was served cold and was very doughy  Pros: Some of the bakery items I saw on display (but couldn't order unless I spent $10 to qualify for interac) looked like they might be tasty The Pizza tasted ok, despite being doughy.  Overall I left feeling frustrated so I won't be back"}
{"text":"This place is a holdout from before any of you knew Ossington existed.  Great spot to get some basic staples, deli, cheese, and breads.  Not the fanciest but there's plenty of other options in the neighbourhood if you want to pay more and be pampered.  I hope this place never closes."}
{"text":"Solid lunch. Simple veal sandwich (no breading/but cooked in a tomato sauce with onions and peppers) on a fresh bun for 5$. Throw a home-made donut in there for another buck or two and a Pepsi and you've got lunch for 7$. Not a lot of frills, but when you've got Pepsi, donuts, and veal - who needs frills?  They also sell household items like VIM and Astroglide here."}
{"text":"Venezia Bakery is a small traditional type bakery. Everybody was complementing their custard tart, so I tried. It was very good. I was very impressed. I tried one day old pastries and cookies and they were horrible. The woman in the shop looked tired and I felt bad. It is not a expensive store at all."}
{"text":"If you like Portuguese natas this place has has the best ones I have tried a lot though my life so I know the best . They are flaky fresh . They sell a little of items like cod , shrimp balls which are also great . Also great breakfast sandwiches at great prices."}
{"text":"On a five day work/leisure trip to Toronto, my husband and I had a long list of restaurants to try. Venezia Bakery was the only place we returned to multiple times. Everything we tried was on point, especially the classic egg tart and the omelette sandwich. The women who work there are your Portuguese grandmother you never had. Come here for your baked goods and breakfast instead of the trendy (and way pricier) places on Queen."}
{"text":"I first became a fan of Portuguese custard tarts in Singapore, where they exist in a half-Chinese form as a product of nearby colonial processes. Living in Chicago, similar custard tarts existed at Chiu Quon bakery in Chinatown, and I frequently added 10 minutes to my commute to get off the train and get one of those tarts. So, I'd consider myself a fan of Portuguese custard tarts, and when I visited Toronto, I was eager to experience the true Portuguese rather than Chinese variety. They lived up to all of my hopes. The custard itself had just as rich a flavor---perhaps even a little more depth of flavor---and the tart itself was the perfect mix of flaky and crunchy. I ended up getting a pastel de nata here every day during my visit to Toronto, and I'd return instantly next time I'm in town.  I also had a bean cake and and bread roll; both of those were pretty tasty, but not as fundamentally exceptional."}
{"text":"Get the Portuguese egg tarts. Venezia recently did an exterior and interior renovation. Different look but pastries and egg tarts have the same amazing crunch and soft centres. $1.25 each tart."}
{"text":"These bakeries dotting Little Portugal are a treat to stumble upon. This one is at an unassuming corner on Ossington surrounded by restaurants and bars yet retains the family run feel that has been a trademark over the decades. Part convenience store, sit down cafe, quick takeout service and coffee to go, Venezia does it all. There are plenty of baked treats with the signature Portuguese tart in various sizes. The mini one is a great idea as it can be popped in your mouth without any gooiness getting on your hands or maybe go for a whole pie filled with that creamy rich goodness. Go ahead, I dare you!"}
{"text":"Perfect on-the-go lunch spot, if that's what you're after. I can't speak to the entire menu (so I can't shoot hire than 4 stars), but the sandwiches are tasty, fresh and don't cost more than $7.   The Portuguese tarts are delicious - no surprise - and the staff are really nice. Worth checking out the next time you leave your lunch on the counter."}
{"text":"My mom passed by this bakery and, bless her heart, she bought my family a box of custard tarts.   I can honestly say I have never had any tart better than these. The crust is light and so delicately crispy and flaky. The custard is rich and perfectly sweet. It's one of the best desserts I've ever eaten. It's taking a lot of willpower not to eat the whole box in one sitting."}
{"text":"This is an interesting spot in the up and coming ossignton area. They had lot of interesting items like Portuguese egg tarts, humongous apple struddles, Cream puffs, eclairs  and somewhat harder to find meringues. I just wanted something to nibble on so picked up an eclair. It was bit stale but to be fair it was almost 7 in the evening and stuff like that hardens up. Small seating area and they do serve coffee/cappuccinos as well. Prices are very reasonable.  I will have to try other items to form a better opinion.  3 Stars for now."}
{"text":"I've been going here for the last 5 years since I've moved to the neighborhood. Staff is great. Their pizzas are great. Different more like pizza bread than regular pizza. Donuts are phenomenal. The count sprinkle chocolate is our favorite."}
{"text":"sandwiches and panini gril... nuff said"}
{"text":"Great pastel de nata.  Friendly service.  Given how much I like pastel de nata, I would come back for more."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 natas, and 2 coconut desert treats.  Didn't really enjoy the coconut ones as they felt overly dry, crispy and unpleasant.  The natas on the other hand were not quite as creamy and they did lack the overall sweetness I was looking for (not a huge dealbreaker) compared to Nova Era."}
{"text":"I had: a Portuguese egg tart. An adorable bakery/grocery store; best $1.25 you can spend"}
{"text":"The service here leaves much to be desired. The old ladies really don't give a shit. But, they have decent sandwiches and a selection of drinks and snacks. Their custard tarts are pretty much the reason to come here, the rest of their bakery selection I'm sure would be nice if it weren't stale.   So cheap lunch, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Pretty good natas, not too sweet, with a flaky crust.  They also have nice selection of Portuguese sausages and cheeses, as well as other baked goods and daily grocery items.  There are a few tables for you to order your nata and coffee and enjoy it there."}
{"text":"Saw all the rave  reviews about their custard tarts and had to try them.  Have had my share of chewy, not so crispy, tooth achingly sweet custard tarts around town that didn't satisfy my cravings.    And the verdict.... Everyone was right!!  Beautiful creamy not too sweet custard nestled in crispy layer upon layer  of golden brown pastry.  It is indeed the best in all of Toronto!  Go now, go often, just eat lots of them!"}
{"text":"This place offers great pastries that I always bring a box of as a gift to host/hostess whenever we go to a dinner party. The nata tarts are amazing - not too sweet, and if they have not sold out, I'm always happy to get my hand on the fluffy donut (soft and airy like a crueller, dusted with sugar), or their french toast."}
{"text":"On the hunt for some Portuguese custard tarts? Just head down to Ossington where the bounty is plentiful. I visited Venezia bakery on a nice Saturday afternoon when I was on the hunt for something sweet. I decided to get 1 custard tart and 1 cod fish fritter (bacalla).   The custard tart certainly had what it takes to fulfill my sweet tooth (not an easy task). The pasty was very flaky and buttery, the filling was quite sweet with a hint of orange. The tart was served cold but I feel like it could have benefited from a minute in the oven to heat it slightly, however it was still enjoyable. The cod fritter was not so good, again served cold it was oily and soggy I would recommend you pass on this.   In addition to egg tarts and other Portuguese favourites this place also has coffee, bread and a small convenience store section. This is a great local bakery; sitting inside for a few minutes I got to see a few regulars come in and interact with the ladies working the counter (speaking mostly Portuguese). Would I come out of my way to come here? No, but if I find myself in the area I might stop in for a tart and a coffee."}
{"text":"After visiting Pasteis de Belem in Lisbon, Portugal, I realized I couldn't get enough of those delicious Portuguese tarts and thought I could never have anything similar after that.  Venezia Bakery is a small local place in the heart of Beaconsfield Village, or \"Little Portugal\".  Venezia Bakery had a lot of baked goods and sells additional products similar to a mini convenient store. However, I think their most popular item, and definitely one that caught my eye was the Portuguese tarts.  For a little more than $1 for each Portuguese tart, these Portuguese tarts definitely had a nice crispy flakey shell, which was something I missed from Pasteis de Belem in Lisbon. However, in my opinion, the inside of the pastry was rather sweet - it MIGHT be because these weren't as hot as the ones I had from Pasteis de Belem and the cool down effect makes the pastry taste a little sweeter than if it would have been if I tasted it hot.  Regardless, this is a cute little find in Toronto if you're missing those delicious Portuguese tarts from Portugal!"}
{"text":"Come here for the Portuguese tart. Seriously the best I have ever had. Too bad they ran out on family day weekend!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty friendly. I got a dozen of the mini custard tarts. They were super cute. They were rather sweet though.  Wow. One of my shortest reviews ever."}
{"text":"When harder to find Portuguese Tarts, I devour them 10 at a time. But I prefer it Venezia (when easier).  If you thought that joke was bad, you haven't tried these tarts yet. Not really. They're pretty delicious, but I didn't find them anywhere near as good as the better ones in town (Brick Street, Golden Wheat, Brazil, Progress, My Market Bakery), and so I'll stick with a 4 star rating.  These tarts - known as Pasteis De Nata - are one of my favourite sweet treat items, and if you like custard you will love them too. I found these ones to be a little stale or stringy and not great or fresh, but still delicious enough, and cheap enough at $1.25, to award 4 stars to this little family-owned bakery.  And remember, Ven in Rome, do as the Romans do, but Ven in Toronto, do as the Venezia Bakery do and eat custard tarts."}
{"text":"Not the best looking bakery, but OMG the food!  The salami sandwiches are killer, and if you haven't tried one you're missing out on life!  The tarts... no words.  They are always crispy and delicious and you can't eat just one.  This local gem is one that hopefully sticks around for years and years."}
{"text":"Before i go any further with this review, i want to say that this may be the first bakery that i made a trip to have real Portugese tarts. My only experience other than this one was HK style Portugese tarts that you will find at Chinese bakeries. Now that i am done my disclaimer, i want to say that i wasn't very impressed by the Portugese tart. The custard was lacking the yolky goodness from a vanilla custard. Thr tart was crunchy, but the glaze over the tart was a bit too sweet for my liking. We paid $8 for 6 Portugese tarts which i thought was reasonable, but i will try another bakery to see if my mind changes on authentic Portugese tarts."}
{"text":"The closest of three Portuguese bakeries to my home (by a hair), I like Venezia best for breakfast and snacks. I also like it best for the inclusive feel. Venezia is the very epitome of the \"mom and pop\" shop, although I only seem to see mom when I go.  Great for: Portuguese tarts (natas), sugar covered dough (not sure what they're called, but they are delicious, sugary donuty things), sourdough bread, and also better than most of the neighborhood convenience stores for eggs, milk, whatever.   The ladies behind the counter are very nice too!  Damn. Now I'm craving sweets."}
{"text":"I think i need to try more to give it a better score. I came for one thing and one thing only, and it was the Portuguese custard tarts.  They were really good, the crust was so flaky but it held together nicely, with the filling just jiggling all around. It wasn't too sweet or anything, but a perfect snack with your coffee.  I also tried the coconut tart by recommendation by the man standing before me in line. The only thing i can compare this to is a coconut tart at chinese bakeries and this one was less sweet. a decent bit of coconut flavour but i think i like it just a bit more sweet."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese Custard Tarts and Corn Bread in Toronto."}
{"text":"Me and a friend stumbled across this cute corner bakery one day while walking downtown. We had no intentions on stopping at a bakery but once we passed it we couldn't resist.  The building itself looks old and rustic and the interior newly renovated but everything served is made from the same recipes from over 30 years ago. We tried there famous Portuguese custards and they were amazing, one of the best we've ever had!  Would highly recommend stopping by if ever in the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"The Portuguese egg tarts are delicious! I ordered a couple to eat there and ended up grabbing more to-go. The custard center is perfect, not too sweet or too eggy, and the top has caramelized patches that give it a such a good brulee flavor. The puff pastry shell is flaky and crunchy.   There are other baked goods and some grocery items available at Venezia Bakery as well. There are some seats inside too."}
{"text":"The vibe: Easily overlooked, the Venezia Bakery feels like you've walked off of the Ossington strip into a classic European deli and bakery run by your grandparents. Sure, there's not much in the way of ambience, but there's a few tables to eat your treats and escape all things hip.   The food: I'll have to be honest, I only sampled the doughnuts and the Portuguese custard tarts but both were INCREDIBLE. The doughnuts tasted really homemade and I'm assuming that they of course are.  My go-to meal: I'd come back for the custard tarts.  Secret: There's an ATM in here if you you're going to hit the Ossington bar strips after."}
{"text":"The place has a beautiful, cozy, authentic feel. Owner/s are extremely warm and friendly  By far the best Pastel De Nata I had in Toronto. Probably even at all. Perfect layers, flaky and crunchy and custard very rich and creamy with the perfect texture.  I also tried the codfish and shrimp pies. Both are taste Homy and delicious.  The Cafe Latté was also very good. Nice strong coffee not bitter.   I definitely recommend this place and would go back again and again :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I looove their custard tarts. If you go on a Saturday morning you can get some really fresh out of the oven. The crust is nice and flaky and the custard is delicious!   I also discovered their sugar donuts (Malasadas) and they are so good! It's become my go to place when I am craving some sweets. They also have a convenience store and a couple of tables to sit and eat although I always get takeout. They only take cash under $10 so remember to keep some change."}
{"text":"I've had my share of Portuguese custard tarts and Venezia Bakery has by far the best in town. I've had them 2-days old from the fridge and the pastry was STILL crispy and the tart still tasted better than any other custard tarts I've had in t.o.   So forgot the places in the St. Lawrence Market or anywhere else you think may have a a good custard tart. This. Is. It!  I've never actually tried anything else here, I'm happily in a monogamous relationship with the custard tarts."}
{"text":"Great little shop with very convenient hours.   In an area with no \"fast-food\" it's a good place to grab a sandwich or snack if you're on the go and still get something hearty and real. The prices are reasonable, the food fresh and delicious and the staff is fantastic.  And of course, as everyone else points out, wonderful custard tarts! A great little neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Venezia Bakery was a little out of the way for us, but the custard tarts are well worth the trip.  Venezia resembles more of a corner store and deli than a full service bakery.  There are some basic dry goods in stock including snacks and sodas, but there are a lot of breads and pastries to choose from as well.  The tarts are less than $1 each, so we got a few of the custard and one coconut for myself.  The custard tarts are simply amazing.  The crust is flaky and chewy, and the custard is sweet and creamy.  The coconut tart was dense and filling for something that looked so tiny!    The pastry items aren't labeled, but since I came in here knowing I wanted tarts, I didn't ask a bunch of questions about what else was available.  I only regret not ordering more; however, I didn't think the custard would hold up in the heat, walking several blocks, or countless streetcar and bus rides.  The lady behind the counter was nice, and you can't beat the hours.  It's rare to come across a bakery open this late.  The hours made it very convenient for us to visit during our recent vacation."}
{"text":"Love love love this bakery. Ran by the cutest couple. Their custard tarts are the best in the city: perfectly flaky crusts with and rich but not too sweet rich custard filling. Amazing cappuccino. Not too over the top and very reasonably priced. Also a great stop for groceries and breads."}
{"text":"\"Um galão por favor\".   This is how you ask for a latte in Portuguese. And at this place, they make a delicious one. They also sell portuguese pastries (OH MY GOD CUSTARD TARTS), cheese and meats.   Ask for a latte, a sandwich (grilled ham and cheese is my favourite), and a dessert for a full portuguese bakery experience.   I suggest trying all kinds of tarts so you can find your favourite."}
{"text":"I think this deli is Portuguese I hope I'm on the nail on this one. The custard tarts are so awesome and very addictive   I was told by a friend about these custard tarts so I travelled there specifically for them and yes they lived up to their hype.  The pastry was really flaky the inside with malleable and gooey and tasted like heaven.  The people who work here are very kind and nice they were smiling and friendly.  I like the area it's in also:)"}
{"text":"Went on a weekday when the store was empty. A younger woman at the counter helped us and oh boy was she extremely rude. One of the worst customer service experiences I've had. We started by ordering pastel de natas, when we added to the order she acted so inconvenienced that we hadn't listed our entire order and had to make her go get a new box. The more we added to the order, the more rude she became and the more she tried to rush us. When we asked if they accepted credit cards (they don't), if they accept foreign debit cards (she claims they do not), and where to access an atm (which she rudely pointed to by the entrance), she acted so condescendingly. I considered walking out without our order. Our trip to Toronto had been so lovely up to that point, full of kind and welcoming Canadians. This woman, however, needs training on how to be courteous. If you walked in speaking Portuguese though she greeted you with the nicest \"hello\" and smile."}
{"text":"Family owned. First time here and I didn't know what to expect but the lady was helpful and she convinced me to get a dozen. Omg so much but so tasty. Custards and tarts of all flavors. It's pretty sweet after the first one.   It's pretty easy to find and there is seating in the bakery and they do serve other things like coffee and breads."}
{"text":"Man, now I wish I have one bakery shop like this in my hood. The pastries are delicious. I bought a coconut tart, beer tart and an apple pie to bring home. My husband is dessert lover and he loves them!  They are also not breaking your bank expensive. The tarts are $1.20 and the pie is $5.99. Frickn' awesome.   They are solid good dessert and if I visit this area, I'll definitely come by again."}
{"text":"Cheap quality food, hostile service though. Not my cup of tea, but it may be for others...."}
{"text":"After going on my grad trip i 'be become addicted to pourtagees styled egg tarts and i've been looking for a place to quench my cravings.  This is a nice little bakery near little Portugal and the only thing I tried here was the egg tarts. The egg tart was really good although it was cold as expected since I went near closing time. The tarts can be brought home to warm up and they taste great.  1.25 for one egg tart 6 dollars for half a dozen"}
{"text":"Oprah has a thing called an Aha moment but for me i have OMG moments,at Venezia i definitely had one.  We were just on Ossington on our way to Queen street when i glanced over and saw \"Portuguese Bakery\".  I immediately wondered, do u think they sell Custard tarts.  We went in and they not only sell them, they also serve palmiers, meringues, and many other treats.  Most sheshe bakeries now are so expensive but the old school bakeries keep their prices low.  The meringue was hard but had that soft middle that you can only get in a meringue.  The palmier was either brushed with honey or sugar because it was sweet and flaky.  I dont think i can say enough wonderful things about the Custard tarts.  The pastry was thin, but not brittle, it somehow remained flaky, and it was thick enough to contain the luxurious filling.  All of these items together costs just over 5 dollars, versus going to a Macaron shop and ordering 2 and it costs you the same.  I cannot wait until my next T dot visit, i know where i am cmg first."}
{"text":"I go here simply for the Portuguese custard tarts. They are to fight over for. $1.25 per tart -- if you buy 6 its $6. Bargain!!!!! The tarts are crispy and flaky on the outside and sweet smooth inside. You can't have just one. Pair it off with some tea and youre golden. Tried the coconut tart - not that good. Just stick with the OG."}
{"text":"There are some people who think all bread is the same, but there are those of us who appreciate it as the art form it can be when done right.  Venezia Bakery bakes bread that tastes good and is not from a factory.  A real \"mom & pop\" kind of store, that offers everything from sandwiches and coffee to a wide variety of Portuguese specialty items, including the famous custard tarts.  The sweet older lady (owner? \"mom\"?) behind the counter was very helpful, I went in looking for Portuguese corn bread - a dense, moist, white bread with a seriously crunchy crust - this is not the yellow corn bread of the South, it is a Portuguese specialty that I had at a restaurant, and after doing some research, Venezia was the place to get it, and I'm so glad I did.  Delicious!  It's not that often you can say that about \"white bread\" but this bread is not Wonder bread, it's a loaf that has character and history, and love.    I also bought a loaf of what the lady behind the counter called \"their specialty\" - a blend of white and whole wheat flour - no corn flour.  It was so tender and soft but again, such unexpected flavour for a piece of bread, with a thinner, crisper crust than the corn bread, I will be back for both kinds.  I also purchased a box of treats to share, and the overwhelming surprise was the brownies!  A shiny crispy crackling top and a deep, dark, chewy and fudgy center... not the least bit dry or cakey, like many brownies these days... my only wish is that it had walnuts, and it would have been the brownie of my childhood in the 70's that you just can't find these days.  I will be back soon, this is the kind of place that I love to shop at and hope to keep alive - a shop with character and quality, owned and operated by lovely people.   I'm a serious fan!"}
{"text":"Ok pourquoi c'est aussi bien côté que je me suis dit en regardant la sélection et l'endroit en tant que tel. C'est pas très grand mais c'est tout de même plus grand que tu pourrais penser. Bonne sélection de viennoiseries et surtout, belle petite madame qui fait tant portugaise qui m'a aidé et m'a donné beaucoup de spécialité portuguaise que j'ai presque tout mangé. Vraiment bon et surtout, tellement cheap!   No english comment, Melinda M. , speak my words."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to get my Nata fix! Got $40 worth; 2 Dzn+9 Natas, 2 Nutella, 2, coconut tarts, 2 almond tarts!  My advice stick with the Natas, $1.25 each! If u get 12 or more it's $1 each! Nutella tarts are $1.50 no discounts! Next time I'll skip it it's basically Nata with a slap of Nutella and coated with a bit of coconuts! Came here at 7:45am! Natas were nice and crispy!"}
{"text":"Faaaaaantastic. Best egg tart I've ever had? I don't know, possibly. I love them all and this one was lovely as ever. They have a ton of stuff that I want to eat, so I would come back here in a second."}
{"text":"What a lovely bakery!  Situated in the heart of Ossington is this sun filled bakery that has many types of goodies including sandwiches.  I love how it's so open and you can tell this is a true love and adored neighbourhood spot.  In my 5 minutes there to get the custard tarts, the staff behind the counter greeted more than 10+ people by name.  Many hugs and holiday wishes went around.  The service is warm and really friendly.  I was greeted when I walked in and once again when I was at the front of the line.  I asked if there were more custard tarts than the 6 in the case and the answer came in a big smile \"Of Course! We baked many today.\"  I asked if I could get the ones with more caramelized tarts and the staff smiled at me ... \"Ohhh she knows how to pick the good ones!\"  Honestly... no wonder this bakery gets such an enthusiastic greeting from patrons.  I purchased 2 custard tarts for $2.40 and it was tucked in a paper bag for after dinner.  Nice thing about this place is there is ample seating by the window so if you want a snack or even lunch you here in a great friendly place.  I bought two other tarts from a nearby Portuguese bakery to do a 'custard tart taste off'.  It's a near tie with Venezia just edging out the win.  I love Venezia variation because it has a true creamy middle ... it wasn't overbaked and still quite creamy instead of being hard jello jiggly.  The crust was my preferred flakey texture that shattered when you crunched your teeth into it.  I also loved the custard flavour... mildly eggy with a good touch of vanilla.  What's not to love!    Hopefully I get to return here and start being a regular!  Tarts are a definite 4 star and the service puts this to a 5 star!"}
{"text":"I fuckin' love hong kong style egg tarts and I heard about ''Portugese egg tarts\" so this was an absolute must-try for me. My cousin recommended this place.  Oh god, I cannot describe how delicious these egg tarts are -sniff sniff-.   1st visit -     1 egg tart 2nd visit -    2 egg tarts 3rd visit       3 egg tarts  Y'get the picture right?   The texture of the tart is just suberb. Thick and creamy and just enough sweetness that would go amazing with a cup of coffee. The outside crust has a bit of a chewy texture which is just plain addicting. These things are heavy too! I'd say it's one of the best baked treats you could have. Filling and friggin delish!! ($1.10/tart)"}
{"text":"Came all the way from the suburb to try some Authentic Portuguese Tarts. I will say it was worth the trip. The bakery sell variety of bread, cookies, and sandwiches.   The tarts were crispy, hot, and not too sweet. Just the right amount of sugar to fulfilled your sugar cravings.   Check this bakery out if you are craving for some Portuguese Tarts."}
{"text":"I love to visit little bakeries that are runned by small business owners. Venezia Bakery is one of those.  There are tons of sweet on displayed apple strudels, cream buffs so much to choose from. There are also European bread and hot/cold sandwiches you can orderd. There are also seatings that you can relax and enjoy your food.  Can I have one custard tart.. Just one? Yes I can only afford to eat one... (I can eat 5 in one seating no problem!)  I have to agreed with the fellow yelper.. The Custard tarts tasted great...  the outside is really flaky.. not heavy has a lot of texture.  The filling is a little sweet.. but will taste great with a cup of strong coffee.  Yes the custard tarts looks burnt! Yes it is the way it supposed to be.. and it does not taste bitter or anything.  If you can put in a toaster oven for 1 minute before eating your tart.. that will taste so so so so awesome.  Interac for $10 purchase or over. If not cash ony."}
{"text":"This delicatessen com cafe offers a cute ensemble of southern European style pastries, meats and cheeses as well as very decent espresso. The husband and wife team who run the place are friendly and authentic, and straight out of a provincial Italian setting, with an air frugality so typical of my grandparents generation. Their attention to detail and customer service, offered with a smile and incredible patience, show just how much they care about their business. These days this is such a rarity that you feel blessed to have found the place. The amazing value for money and pleasant environment have made this a fixture in my Sunday morning routine. Word of advice though. Get there before 10am or else you'll be waiting in a long line-up."}
{"text":"Nice little Portuguese bakery. You will your staples, breads, tarts, deli and coffee.  Tiny and at the a corner street.  Good homemade goodness."}
{"text":"One of the best makers of custard tarts left in the West End. We often get sandwiches to take with us to the park. Service is fine; cash is king."}
{"text":"Tosta mistas make me happy.   Ham and cheese on a fluffy bun scrunched down to grilled, crispy perfection for under $5. It's my second favourite tosta mista* in town, and the price is definitely right. Most people come for the pastries and custard tarts, but I say: salt is the greatest seasoning of them all, and next time you should grab a sammie.   If you live in the hood, they also have a bank machine and many necessities to make your life easier. It's your bakery-meets-corner-store, and I am a fan.   *This bakery is better for all other fare, but gotta give the tosta mista prize to Progress Bakery on Dovercourt, N of Bloor."}
{"text":"I love this bakery so much. When ever I'm working in the area, I always grab grub here. Their custard tarts are amazing. As are their fresh deli sandwiches. The coffee is delicious as well!   Great prices, amazing food and friendly staff. Could a girl ask for anything more? I think not. Om Nom nom."}
{"text":"Heaven! The custard tarts are so fresh and flaky, just the right amount of sugar in the cream. The cream itself is so soft and gooey in the middle, unlike others I've tried before, where the cream was too dense. Outstanding! I've got also Quince Jam, I love it, there will be jam rolls this afternoon :)!"}
