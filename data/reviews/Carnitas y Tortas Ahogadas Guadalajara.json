{"text":"First let me say that I was born in Guadalajara and I'm used to REAL Mexican food, now with that said. This place has the ABSOLUTELY BEST tortas ahogadas and tacos in Las Vegas, they are as close as it gets to my home town. This is a MUST try place!!!! Everyone here was so nice and helpful, I live in Summerlin and I am coming back and often"}
{"text":"Wow!  i have not had torta's like this since I was A kid.  Hung over and craving some mexican food, we past by this place and decided to try it...man did it hit the spot. The carnitas are sooo tenderand flavorful that you cant go wrong with these choices. It's to bad i'm not local, but i intend to hit this spot next time i'm town."}
{"text":"This place is always closed, and if there open they close early not even the time they have daily. There food prices are very Expensive. There food is alright not special to cost that much."}
{"text":"Stopped by as a break from the hustle and bustle of the Vegas Strip. Needed some authentic Mexican food and this place looked pretty promising. Came in with a group of 10 and were quickly and effectively seated, the staff was super friendly, and although the venue is pretty small, it's an overall positive experiences. Now the food was DELICIOUS! I had the torta ahogada and it was to die for. Everything I expected and more. Being from Guadalajara, my palette is pretty spoiled, and let me tell you, their tortas truly give them a run for their money. I also tried the cueritos and buche and those as well were great. Definitely recommend this place to anyone craving authentic Mexican food. Will definitely be stopping by next time I'm around these neck of the woods!!"}
{"text":"Wow!! I absolutely love this place!! The tacos ahogados are the best!! Reminds me of Guadalajara  the instant you walk in the door. So good! Didn't have there tortas ahogados because I loaded up in there tacos.l but next time I'll save room for there tortas! They also have Chivas stuff so you know your in the right place for real food from Guadalajara. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes tacos or tortas. A 5 star place for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! 100% Recomendado! Service was great! Todos eran muy amables.  Nos atendieron muy bien. Volveré aquí definitivamente!  Los precios son buenos también. No se arrepentirán!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Carne Asada and tortilla were best I've had since my wife's family. Great vibe! Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Le doy dos estrellas porque fallan en lo elemental como una buenas tortillas para sus tacos y su birria están MUY malas saben a químico, saben raras, amargas!!!!Teniendo buenas tortillerías como las de Cárdenas es un error usar estás tan chiquitas y malas, el servicio muy bueno, la birria deliciosa pero muy grasosa y la torta pues entiendo lo del birote pero porque dañan su comida así con esas tortillas tan malas!!! comi también tacos dorados rico el relleno pero no eran tacos dorados eran tacos corriosos comi también tacos al vapor  pues como buena tapatía estoy deseosa de los sabores de mi tierra y pues eeerroooor la misma tortilla ósea que el mismo pésimo sabor,  la verdad solo por la tortilla no voy a regresar ojalá lo mejorarán solo así regresaría"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall, kinda shady on the outside.... But go right in!! There is a genuine effort to got their good as close to authentic as possible. And they people working there were very nice.  We ordered birria estilo Jalisco, and a torta ahogada. The birria was tender, delicious, and the broth was extremely flavorful. Paired with some corn torillas, lemon and onion... Dish from Mexican heaven.   The torta ahogada (which I didn't have high expectations) was a solid B. The bread is the hard part for me, since I am from Guadalajara, there is a particular bread called birote, that can only be properly made in the state of Jalisco. Don't ask why, that is just that, it's a bread specific to the region and it makes the whole torta special.  They do bake a pretty similar bread here, and it gets you close to the real thing, totally worth trying if you miss home and a good torta ahogada!"}
{"text":"We loved the tacos mixtos and the salsas are amazing, my favorite was the  habanero salsa, good service,  clean restaurant"}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp! Just went today and already thinking of what to order tomorrow! Best tacos in the world! I found my new spot in Vegas! The consomé is the perfect cure for a hangover!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. They also have hand made tortillas which make the tacos taste even better. Their tejuinos aren't good at all so I don't recommend that but everything else is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb! We tried the torta ahogada and was delicious.. my husband ordered the Burria and consome.. the consome hit the spot. Just what we needed. Homemade food! Will be our spot every time we go to Vegas. Oh! I'm forgetting the chia water, so good and refreshing"}
{"text":"Parking right outside the building. We came for lunch and didn't have a problem finding it. Service was so friendly- we were unfamiliar with a lot of the food on the menu and the server was friendly and explained what he recommended. We ended up getting a torta, tacos (can't remember what kind) and horchata and everything was great. Prices were low too. This will definitely satisfy your Mexican food cravings."}
{"text":"A little overpriced for tacos ($3.00), but very delicious. First time eating here. Around the area seems sketchy, but the best Mexican foods are always at the most ghetto streets. The ambiance has that Mexican flair, music, and friendly service. Will definitely come back for a lunch date with the family."}
{"text":"At first I didn't wanna come here but when I order there tacos they were delicious the meat was soft and juicy I will be coming again"}
{"text":"Had the three taco variety. All were very good. Will stop by again. The place was very clean and service was good as well. There is one shared bathroom in the back if you need to use it."}
{"text":"Great food. If you are from gdl you're. Goona love this place the birria is. Pretty Good. also the combination of buche carnitas and cueritos. Plate is off the charts gracias Pedro. Best carnitas"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great taste. Fast service. It's a hidden gem in vegas. We had the torta ahogada and taco de canasta de papa, both were so delicious. Salsas are bomb, habanero salsa is very spicy. Recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food is so very expensive.... It's hot inside and owner is pushy ...$12 for soda and torta is rediculous"}
{"text":"The birote used for this Tortas is so crispy and stays crispy even after being \"drowned\" in the sauce! I am so picky when it comes to meat but every single bite was clean and by clean I mean I never ever chewed on a piece of fat or cartilage. The carnitas were chopped to perfection and the beans are amazing! I loved everything about this Torta and it truly reminded me of the Tortas my grandma and I used to get at the tinaguis in Guadalajara."}
{"text":"This place is def 5 start joint! Went here again Sunday and got 1lb of carnitas to go. They give u homemade tortillas and works to go! Best tortas ahogadas. Best birria! Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Carnitas, Buche, Cueritos, and freshly made corn tortillas, what else can I ask for?  This hole in the wall is no joke! The carnitas were delicious!  They also sell Goat Birria and consome de birria. While I'm not a goat meat fan the rest of my party loved it!  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"So amazing ! I got to practice my Spanish too! I everyone  speaks  Spanish so be prepared ! The Tortas were bomb and so tasty ! Thank you for your service and kindness !!  So damn good ! Go on Tuesdays 2-1 Tortas!"}
{"text":"Was looking for an authentic Mexican place with a good yelp rating. This place more than lived up to its reviews!   It's a clean, friendly locals place. The food was fantastic!  Loved it!  Josephina Rodriguez, our server, was wonderful. So friendly!"}
{"text":"The cook should train the waiters.  I think his name is Edgar,  he was the cook and he was so enthusiastic And friendly  which was opposite the lady that was waiting on us.  When we sat down we were her only customers but she still managed to screw up our order multiple and I mean multiple times. The food here is very delicious and authentic so I will go back and I would recommend it.  It is only open for breakfast and lunch which I find a bit odd but that's fine the food is great. The place was very clean but they do not have a bathroom for guests which is a bit strange.   I recommend trying all the taco sauces they are incredible and unlike any I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"The menu is very limited, but the tortas and tacos we ordered were very good.  Also exceptional were the house bottles of hot sauce brought to the table.  No so exceptional was the fact they were out of churros, out of agua fresca, only had paid bottles for water and said the house made tortillas would be $4.00 instead of the $3.00 menu price becuase they \"made them extra large\" that day.  We also had to wait for the waitress to complete the texting on her phone to get her attention.  Overall, there is someone running the kitchen making some great food, but the rest of the operation is run so poorly its hard to call it a restaurant."}
{"text":"I love their tacos Al pastor. My husband gets carnita tacos. We drive from Henderson once a week to enjoy this food. We always have the same male waiter. He's awesome. I can't get enough of their food!"}
{"text":"Super good came for Vegas fun and goggle tortas this place came out with good reviews came to try love it super delicious I recommend clean good service thank u till next Vegas vacation I sure will be here"}
{"text":"Excelente servicio !!! Pedimos los tacos de canasta  y la torta ahogada   muy ricooo y recomendado !!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! We ordered the torta ahogada, birria & a michelada/preparada. Everything was absolutely delicious & the food quality is great, totally recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is the most hospitable locals spot. True experience Tapatio. The Birria here is made by expert Birrieros de Guadalajara. The Tortas Ahogadas are made with Mexican style French bread. The Salsa is fresh and flavorful. The owner, Pedro shared a Tejuino with Nieve de Garrafa lime flavor, EXCELLENT. Definitely worth the trip. OMG the carnitas though! all I can say is WOW! The best kept secret in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Torta Ahogada Mixta! So good, my friend and I shared one so they kindly split it for us. We also ordered tacos de Birria and Buche! The Michelada were really good too. Amazing. The service was great. Small but great place!"}
{"text":"When you've been on the strip for a week and you stumble across a good spot off path you've gotta share it . Good flavor good food .and even tho I don't speak Spanish they got me taken care of and didn't make me feel uncomfortable.. best meal all week at 25% of the cost of anything we had while running around . Worth the drive !!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight. This was our second time here. Last time we only had the mixto tacos and some canasta tacos. Today we also ordered those tacos but the server offered a sample of the birria. I don't normally order birria because I am always disappointed but this one  was so good I had to order a taco. I will definitely order birria tacos from now on!"}
{"text":"Went here due to the 4 star reviews, the restaurant is definitely not 4 stars. Don't waste your time or money. Food was not worth it. I asked for tacos dorados, the server said they were out of tortillas but they offered taquitos. Which makes no sense. -.-  Food was nothing special. The taquitos had cheddar cheese, what is this ..Taco Bell!?! The rest of the order was wrong.  If you want good quality food, go to Arepas instead"}
{"text":"Came a couple of times already and each time it has been a wonderful experiences. Such attentive service, delicious food and amazing prices. Cindy has served us the last couple of times and it has been a joy every time. You won't regret coming here. Tuesdays they have 2-4-1 so come check it out. Also, the micheladas are bomb."}
{"text":"Delicioso!!!!  Best birria & consome!!!  Great customer service!! Arriba las chivas!!!"}
{"text":"Best if you head to EL BIROTAZO!!!So food was good but nothing I would pay $90 for. Yes $90 for four people. It is so over price and not a great selection of the tacos de canasta. Won't be back."}
{"text":"So, I was over at the auto glass place getting a new windshield put into my truck when I thought I will just walk over here and try it out.  WOW, was I impressed the Carnitas were OUT of this world! The service was good I only had a few knocks on them.   1. A .75 cent charge on any credit card order under 40.00 2. No ice tea  The place was very clean and the out door seating plentiful.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best birria, and Tortas Ahogadas I've ever had!! Highly recommend this place. Really great service too."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best carnitas I've had in a long time.  The tacos are just the right size and full of flavor.  I will be returning to try their tortas ahogadas!  I was also impressed with their fresh Jamaica."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing! It has a great taste and it was a decent sized portion. The service was also great! The food was served quickly, All the employees are very friendly, awesome place overall! Definitely recommend it to anyone that's in the area"}
{"text":"It's delicious!!! The birria is very good . I love it . I go at least once a month . I highly recommend it ! The salsas are great as well! The carnitas are good , however they have a lot of fat."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! The place is clean and the service friendly and quick.  My favorite were the tacos and you have to try their specialty wet sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing.  Fuimos a Vegas este pasado fin de semana y fuimos Sábado y Domingo. Todo estuvo súper delicioso, el personal súper atentos en especial la señora del Domingo que nos atendió afuera.  Ahora ya tendremos a donde ir cuando vayamos devuelta."}
{"text":"I had torta ahogada and two taco carnitas! The carnitas are juicy and mouthwatering!  My torta was delicious.  Washed it all down with a glass of horchata.  Best Mexican food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The horchata is awesome and the carnitas is mouth wateringly delicious. They have a few hot sauces that are definitely worth taking home to have  The staff is friendly and the food is bomb diggity.   The manager came to chit chat and was nice to us  I hope to come back again with more friends to share the experience   10/10 recommend"}
{"text":"Had the torta ahogada and it was very good. It was very flavorful but not spicy.     However ordered the tacos dorados and those were amazing.  I got them with meat.  The crunch of the tostada with the meat and onions and sweet savory spice made it perfect.   Make sure you order home made tortillas (Sat and Sun) to make a taco with the falling meat.  Everything was great.  Also, make sure to get a michelada to wash it down.  A bit spicy so if you don't like too much spice make sure you tell them light on spice for michelada.   Cindy, our server, was amazing too.  Very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Food is delicious  my favorite was the tacos mixtos, chia water I believe it was cucumber it was very refreshing and the spicy salsas they have are awesome . Great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and Authentic Mexican food. The Torta Ahogada is true to the Guadalajara flavor and the Birria is amazing. A great place to try real Mexican food without the need of an upset stomach."}
{"text":"Food is delicious the birria tacos are really good the tortas haogadas are bomb I suggest you check this place out friendly environment aswell I will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"one of the most authentic Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas, The prices are ridiculously low and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Ok guys here's the lowdown for this place. This isn't a five star, strip experience meal. No Michelin stars were earned here. You come to this place to grab a quick bite.   Haven't tried tortas ahogadas? Go ahead and order it next time to see what you've been missing. These delicious pork carnitas sandwiches are killer! Ask for some extra sauce on the side, you'll want to enjoy every last bit of the bread. Don't get paid til Friday and want a cheap meal? 2 for 1 Tuesday tortas....you can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Took a chance and this place did not disappoint. Tried tacos that I did not know what was in them other then it came from a pig. So yummy!! We will coming back!"}
{"text":"I give this place a 5 star for food and service, but only a 2 for cleanliness. Is you are looking for beans, rice, or \"chile verde\" this is not the place to go. This restaurant serves food that you find in Mexico not the usual \"Tex-Mex\" not sure what that really means."}
{"text":"Best tortas ahogadas in town. I love coming here on Tuesday's when they have there 2 for 1 special.  Friendly staff and upbeat environment"}
{"text":"Booty burning deliciousness!! Tortas ahogadas are Bombay. Birria y consume are insane. Tacos de papa are like mama's. East Side approved!"}
{"text":"This place is Fucking amazing lol sorry for my language but there isn't any other way to describe it lol ! I just moved here from California and was sad I left my go to torta place in Oakland but trying this new place just woke up my taste buds !! Being from Guadalajara and knowing what the authentic tortas ahogadas taste like not every place meets my expectations, but this place deserves a 5 stars!! And their micheladas are amazing too !! You just have to come try it !! I will definitely be coming here all the time !! It's my home away from home !!"}
{"text":"Items Selected: Michelada Taco Cueritos Taco Dorado con Carne Tacos Asada, Pastor, Birria Tortas Ahogadas  Rico Postre Jericalla  Fancied by a few local fine dining Chefs as their go-to for the authentic flavors of Western Mexico, it was just past eight o'clock on Friday night that the dining room at Carnitas y Tortas Ahogadas Guadalajara was found sparsely populated, a team of two servers plus two cooks making up for limited English skills with some truly delicious food and excellent service to match it.  Decorated with the restaurant's logo, maps of Mexico and some handmade pottery for sale near the door, Carnitas y Tortas Ahogadas Guadalajara features table service both indoors and al fresco from a carefully curated menu written only in Spanish, the focus on braised Meats including several styles of Goat noteworthy, though the restaurant's eponymous Sandwich is undoubtedly promoted as a \"must have\" item.  Doing the small things that matter to stand out, Breads and Tortillas both made on-site with all Meats braised in-house daily, those looking for variety are invited to try any of the restaurant's big flavors by way of Tacos with 1-lb portions also offered alongside Tortillas for larger parties, a total of $35 after tax and tip yielding a substantial amount of food with an additional $7.50 added for an oversized Michelada.  Waiting just a few minutes for the bulk of an order, items rolling out as ready from the kitchen, first bites of a Pork Skin Taco were fatty and succulent without a lot of acid to wash out the funkiness while a follow-up Fried Taco stuffed with ground Beef was unfortunately a bit oily, the Carrot slice on top packing a big wallop of heat while the pickled Onions, sliced Radish and Slaw helped to balance out the piquant orange Sauce beneath it.  Ready to tuck into the sopping wet Sandwich just as more Tacos arrived, each divided in two and lightly topped with Lime, Onions or one of two Salsas provided in squeeze bottles, one would be hard-pressed to decide whether the Barbacoa Goat or Al Pastor Pork offered more flavor, the Carne Asada unfortunately a bit too dry, perhaps as a result of the late time of arrival.  Finally getting around the Torta, slow cooked hunks of Pork literally fork-tender on a bun somewhat akin to Baguette that was still crunchy despite being fully saturated with spicy Tomato Sauce, suffice it to say that the specialty from Jalisco is every bit worth its name on the marquee, a traditional dessert from the region one part Flan and one part Crème Brûlée with just enough sugar to compliment the egginess.   ****Not exactly the sort of place likely to receive critical attention, both the location and understated signage directed mostly at its local population, Carnitas y Tortas Ahogadas Guadalajara is a strong reminder of the rich Ethnic heritage found just a few miles East of Las Vegas Boulevard - the sort of place where low prices pair with a lot of passion to give diners an experience tourists would never imagine exist in a city known for $1,000 bottle service."}
{"text":"This place is so good. We had the tortas ahogadas, carnitas, tacos dorados, birria de chivo and there tejuino. Gotta say this place is a must if your ever out in Vegas. The owner took very good care of us. He showed us that fellow Jalisco love. I'm here every time I'm out this way from now on. BIG THUMBS UP"}
{"text":"Nos mudamos de Orange CA a Las Vegas hace 6 meses hemos estado buscando un lugar auténtico con  servicio excelente, ya lo encontramos! Josefina, nos hizo sentir en casa. La birria y carnitas me recordaron a la comida de mi abuelita. Regresaremos muy pronto. Translation: food is amazing. Service is excellent, feels like home. This is an authentic Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Hands down best customer service plus the food, amazing, quick service and the food can fill you and satisfied the Mexican craving you have going on."}
{"text":"Wow, hands down the best carnitas I've ever tasted. The carnitas torta comes filled w meat, a side of pickled onions, side of limes and sits on top of a sauce. It's delish!   What's also amazing is their array of hot sauces they have for your extra condiment pleasure. The waitress brings them to your table, introduces each one and tells u what to expect as far as spice level. We didn't dare try the habanero since the one below that (the one recommended for the torta) was plenty spicy!   Service is friendly and restaurant is clean! Loved it here.   We'll definitely be back since my mom lives across the street from this gem!"}
{"text":"Frikkin love this place!!!   Really took me back to Guadalajara and visiting with my family.  The tortas ahogadas are on point!!!!  They have several spicy sauces to try from.   But honestly why I loved the most was the tacos de Cueritos. When I was a lot younger and would go to Mexico for summer vacation, sundays were the days to go to the local butcher shop. They would prep chicharones in huge frying \"tubs\"? And offer tacos to customers. These little morsels reminded me of that.   And they have micheldas I mean can you really complain!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here because of the reviews. Not to sure why everyone likes this place. $8.50 for a torta ahogada was over priced. They don't even pile on the carnitas. Just slice open the hard as a rock torta and put in a little meat. Tacos are $3.00 and a michelada is $7.00.  The place is clean, service was great but $36. For 3 tortas and 3 sodas , I don't think so."}
{"text":"Friendly attentive staff. Glass coke bottles like in Mexico :) caution! The habanero sauce they give you on the side is extremely hot. I put dots on my taco and my mouth was on fire! The taco was filled with carnitas. Great portion!! I was full of two tacos! I love little dive places like this. Great people, culture and amazing food done right."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when trying a torta ahogada for the first time. I stopped in on a Tuesday to take advantage on their 2x1 tortas ahogadas plus extras all to go.  The sauce and all fixins' are packed for you on the side. The bread is chewy,  yet firm enough to withstand the sauce. I really enjoyed it. Also picked up a carnitas taco with enough filling to make 2 tacos. Potato canasta taco was just alright. And lastly a chicharon/bean canasta taco was more beans than meat, will pass on ordering this again.  I will definitely be back. Service was quick and the food came out within just a few minutes as well.  FYI: 75 cent surcharge on credit cards."}
