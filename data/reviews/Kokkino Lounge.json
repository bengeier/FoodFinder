{"text":"I think its Danforth's best kept secret. I also accidentally walked in. The staff was a good looking group of people, very attentive and nice. They even treated us to a shot after dinner (that's rare these days)!!! The food was nicely presented and very tasty. Not your typical Greek dishes but definitely authentic. It started to get busy later on in the night apparently its a hot spot. Overall the clientele was very fashionable and in a great mood...very clean crowd. The owner is also very personable and welcoming.  I recommend everyone to come here, especially because they make you feel at home! :)"}
{"text":"We were strolling by this place and decided to give it a try.

I was not impressed by the line up of tapas dishes. They were very overpriced. The place was not even busy but we waited a very long time for our initial greeting from the waiter.

We decided to try the large sized meat platter as recommend by our waiter and we were extremely disappointed. The plate was $38 and was really dry and definitely not enough food for two people. It was basically a dry little snack.

We chose a decent looking wine from the menu but the server was unable to provide it for us as he did not have the key to their wine area. Bizarre.

I will not be going back and I don't recommend it. A very disappointing experience. If I could 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I walked into Kokkino by accident... Almost. We had been eyeing Pantheon across the street, but since my darling didn't want to cross to the other side ofthe street, I connected to Yelp in search of a great Greek find on the north side of Danforth. We were down to two options: Mezes and Kokkino. Kokkino wasn't packed, and looked nice, so we went in and grabbed a seat.
The \"lounge\" in very ornately decorated, with fancy lighting, velvet covered seats at the wall, fancy dishes, and a lovely interior over-all. Unlike some of those \"I wish I was upscale but I don't know how\" places, this lounge definitely looks posh.
The waiter/bartender was prompt at getting our order. We ordered a village salad to share (it didn't look like there was enough, but there actually was). We also ordered a three set of meses (appetizers, so to speak, any three of the list for $21). We decided on the saganaki  (flambéed cheese!), the stuffed crab mushroom, and the feta bruschetta. Again, when the food came, I was afraid there wasn't enough, but there was plenty. The whole meal began with a plate of hot white and whole wheat pitas, multi-grain bread, and brown bread, served with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and herbs to dip. Yum!!

The waiter came by every once in a while to check in on us. My only complaint is that after we finished our meal, we waited about 10 minutes (if not 15) for the waiter to realise that we wanted our cheque. Considering he had already cleared our plates, and we looked at him pointedly every time he walked by, I found this to be a little frustrating. We had made no indication that we wanted to continue eating after he had cleared our plates. maybe it's a Greek tradition to sit for a while after dinner, considering it's not the first time I've heard of this happening in a Greek restaurant... 
This is actually why this place isn't getting 4 stars. i'd give it 3.5, but that's not an option.
I would definitely come here again, but not before stopping by other Greek places first.
My opinion: if you want an upscale environment, with fancy tapas-style food, by all means come here (you WILL love it). But if you want to eat your fill, bring home leftovers, and relax, drive cross-town to Just Greek (STILL the best Greek food I've eaten!)."}
