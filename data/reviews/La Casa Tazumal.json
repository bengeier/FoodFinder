{"text":"Home style Central American food made by loving hands. Cleveland continues to deliver the best plate for plate world food that you can find anywhere. Come expecting a home cooked meal and you will leave full and satisfied. The papusas, the Salvadorian nation dish, is made to looks as appealing as it taste. If you've ever had them made in haste, you will appreciate the time the lovely do√±a puts into making them. They don't carry my favorite brand of champagne cola, but I can't hold that against them. If you know a word of Spanish speak it, you will be me with warmth and the food will taste better."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant. Being from Los Angeles I'm familiar with latin american cuisine. The owner  Maria, IS charming. But the food was so heavy with old grease, I couldn't eat much. I tried 2 different pupusas. Both were greasy and heavy. I also ordered the fried plantanos (served with black beans and crema); the plantano had been breaded and deep fried, and again was so heavy with rancid grease it was inedible. On a happier note, the horchata was good. If she replaced her oil with fresh oil, and perhaps cooked at a higher heat so the food wouldn't soak up all the oil things would be a lot better."}
{"text":"Simply wonderful. La Casa Tazumal was my first experience with Salvadoran cuisine and it definitely won't be my last. While the neighborhood isn't great and the digs are humble, inside you'll find a delicious and unique take on Latin food that often gets overlooked.  Maria, the owner/chef/waitress/propreitor/everything, doesn't speak much English (although the menu is in English), but her friendly demeanor broke through any language barrier, as did, of course, her amazing food. She specializes in pupusas, thick corn tortillas stuffed with various kinds of cheese, beans, and meats that resemble pancakes from the outside, and come served with a type of Salvadoran cabbage slaw called curtido. They may look a bit small at first, but they are extremely filling, and once you pile some curtido on top and try some of the sides (the fried plantains are wonderful), you should be set, and the prices are barely there for food this delicious and hearty.  This place is truly a hidden gem. It doesn't have much in the way of polish or setting, but if you're willing to take a chance and stretch yourself out a bit, you'll find one of the best ethnic culinary experiences I've had in Cleveland in the 22 years I've lived here."}
{"text":"When I first walked in, the restaurant was so cute and small that I thought I was about to get flawlessly tasty authentic Mexican food. My expectations were not met though.  I thought the food was just pretty bland and the meat was so tough that I could barely eat it.   The pupusas were the best part of the meal, and I wish that I hadn't ordered anything else because they were really good.  If you pay with a credit card make sure you put the tip on the check before she takes it because otherwise you can't add a tip."}
{"text":"Definitely an upgrade from the last Yelp International Supper Club!!  La Casa Tazumal is a small and quaint little El Salvadorian? restaurant that can seat maybe 20-25 people with large number of plants and colorful decor.  The waitress/owner had a bit of a trouble understanding us, but she really nice- reminds me of cute, immigrant grandmas.   I was a little disappointed with their Spanish Hot Chocolate as it wasn't spicy, as I anticipated.  I did like that it was not as sugary/sweet as regular hot chocolate.    Let's start talking papusas!! The papusas were delicious- nice mix of pull pork meat and cheese!  They were filling, but not heavy.  Their hot sauce is flavorful and great with the papusas, but not really spicy.  I love love love their pickled cabbage/vegetables, really gave the papusas a nice crunch and refreshing kick.  Unfortunately, the papusas were the best part of the meal.  My Biztec Encellendaro? (steak and onions) was severely overcooked, almost rubbery.  The onions were nice- seasoned with adobe and cooked down.  I could leave the beans and the rice out of the meal- neither were flavorful.  The tortillas were just okay and it seems like they're small and homemade, which is nice and refreshing from the store-bought packs.  I never really like tortilla wraps, though.  The fried plantains were nicely cooked, not mushy from overcooking, but they were overly sweet (I wonder if they sprinkled sugar over the plantains before cooking them).    Definitely worth going for the pupusas, but not Biztec Encellendaro/drinks."}
{"text":"I love this place.  They don't quite offer catering service, but I've ordered a couple dozen for parties and meetings before.  Each time they were met with rave reviews!  I also attended a large benefit dinner there.  Massive compliments to the cooks and servers for being able to handle so many people so easily!  The curtido and red sauce are excellent.  The pupusas themselves taste like deep-fried heaven!  Service is wonderfully quick and you can easily feed four people on less than $20.    The owners and cooks are also some of the sweetest people I've ever met."}
{"text":"I loved this little hole in the wall family style El Salvadorian restaurant.  I was driving by and saw it on my way to Ray's MTB Park and then decided to check it out for lunch.  My plan was just to get some papusas or whatever looked good to go, but the vibe was so relaxing, chill, and friendly that I decided to stay and eat there and I'm glad I did.  I ordered the Cena Typica because it seem to come with a little of everything.  I thought everything was great.  I like the cabbage and the hot sauce too.  The most interesting thing I ordered was the homemade horchata - it was unlike anything I've ever had before (in a good way kind of).  Ended up ordering a couple papusa to go for some friends at the MTB Park to try since they were so cheap and so good!  It just reminded me of being at home with my ex-Costa Rican family.  Five stars if you are looking for that type of experience;  I wouldn't recommend it if you aren't."}
{"text":"If you want pupusas served like your grandma made them, this is the place to go!  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but when you enter, and see the tables covered in brightly colored tablecloths and are greeted with genuinely friendly hellos from the owner and her daughter, the location fades from your mind.  The menu isn't page after page, which is fine. We came for pupusas, and boy oh boy were they great. I got pupusas with cheese and beans and my boyfriend got pupusas with just beans. We also ordered yucca, beans, rice, and fried plaintains.  No tv in the dining area which was really nice, it allowed us to focus on conversation and enjoying our meal.  I was able to see into the kitchen as our food was being prepared and I swear the owner added some grandma love to my food. The pupusas were filled nicely with and even balance and even had some chopped green chiles, which was a nice surprise.  The beans were flavorful without being salty or slimy. The yucca was nice and crisp and my boyfriend loves his plaintains.  I had to get an extra pupusa to go and when they brought it out, they took the time to put the slaw in a separate ziploc bag so it didn't make my pupusa soggy.  I loved this place and it's moved toward the top of places to take our friends and family. Give it a try! You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"It's all about the papusas... and the tamales ;)  Cute, quaint, kitschy...  Maria is in the back, cooking everything from scratch.   The pupusas are great. I love the tangy hot sauce. I could eat at least 5 of them. But then I wouldn't have room for a tamale. I've had quite a few tamales in my day and I must say, these are some of the best. Wrapped in a banana leaf and so tender and steamy, the chicken filling to corn is in perfect ratio. I get a little miffed when there's barely any filling. These are perfect. I also love the pastels. They are similar to an empanada, crispy with filling.  I've also had the chile rellenos. It was just OK, nothing too earth shattering. Some friends of mine got carne asada. They said it was severely overcooked. I had to try it for myself. Umm, yep... Note to self, stay away from the steak entrees.   The drinks can be a bit hit or miss. I always order the horchata. It's sweet, but not sickeningly so. The tamarind drink is a bit much. Too sweet to be enjoyable for me. The ensalada drink was just weird and too sweet as well.  I come here for the ambiance, the ethnic experience and the finger food. The rest, well...."}
{"text":"CLE International Supper Club rotation brought me and 8 others to La Casa Tazumal for an evening.  Don't pay attention to the overgrown indoor plants or even the bright green walls or the bright red chairs.  Do pay attention to the deliscious smells of Pupusas, Tamale, or Pastel.  This El Salvador cuisine offering little place rocks the  traditional Salvadoran dish made of thick, hand-made corn tortilla usually filled with a blend of cheese, cooked pork meat, refried beans.   I tried the combination place that included 1 Pupusa, 1 Chicken Pastele (red tinted corn flour-based dish with a unique stuffing of chicken, and with chopped potatoes and carrots), and 1 Chicken Tamale.  The Tamale came piping hot moist wrapped in a green leaf.  This was one of the tastiest Tamale I've had.  It was a sharp contrast to dried husk wrapping an equally dry sometimes tasteless tamale of many other places.  I can have half a dozen Tamale from La Casa Tazumal.  My Pastele however was a little overcooked on the outside.  Inside was I paired my dinner with the Tamarind drink.   If you like sweet drinks, this drink is an excellent choice.  The hot chocolate started my evening while we waited for the rest of the group to arrive, was warm, sweet and perfect to warm me up for the rest of the dining festivities.  La Casa Tazumal is quiet most nights and great for small groups.  This is definitely the perfect place to kick back and try their offerings.  Some in the group did not have a great experience with the more entree dishes like the chicken or steak.  In contrast, my ordered items were mostly perfect.  La Casa is an experience in the dining as well as the ambiance it offers complete with the sweet ladies, the down-home decor,  as well as linguistic accent.   Oh and when you get the bill you will almost fall off your chair - because of the affordable prices."}
{"text":"Sometimes we enter and we know this is the dream of someone everyone told was such a good cook she should open a restaurant. It may be humble to most but to the owner it is beautifully hers. La Casa is such a place.   The menu consists of all the things the owner has served friends, neighbors, and family at her kitchen table. Nothing fancy, nothing trendy, just home made traditional Salvadorean food. Each of Spain's children adapted her dishes to their own part of the world. This is not Mexican or Cuban or Peruvian food. It is uniquely El Salvadorean. From the pickled cabbage to the pureed black beans to the stuffed corn cakes the tastes were new to me. My friend had a bad day but when he left here he said all was right with the world.   If you like folk food, like a friendly and cheerful server, a proud talented cook/owner try La Casa. I think the McGeneration may not enjoy this restaurant. Grilled cheese is not served a thousand ways and there is no beer let alone kool aid beers. But for those who think it is a good idea to support local small restaurants this is a good choice.   The menu is large and varied, the portions are generous, and the cuisine is most likely new to you. You may find it as I do a new favorite place to go for comfort food."}
{"text":"Do√±a Maria is so sweet and attentive. These pupusas are my favorite yet, and I've had them all over town, FL, NY, Chicago, AZ and Honduras. The pupusas are super stuffed, the slaw is nicely pickled and the sauce has a good kick to it. Parking is no problem and it is relatively inexpensive. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The first Yelp CLE Int'l Supper Club of 2012 and we were all excited to kick off the new year with pupusas!   This little corner Latin American resto is super cute. Totally a mom 'n pop place, but owned by the sweetest little lady ever. We showed up with a party 9 and were the only people in the place. You could see right into the kitchen to see the owner and another little lady cooking it up. So adorable.   There is a minor language barrier, but nothing too bad. She can still understand what you're ordering and saying. And yes, they do accept credit cards. But be sure to write a tip on your check before she takes your card, otherwise you won't be able to leave one.   I ordered two pupusas and they were pretty darn good. It was my first time, but I still thought they were tasty, especially with the pickled relish and the not-so-hot-sauce that was big on flavor. I will say that I didn't really enjoy any of the sides. The beans were pureed and tasteless and the rice had a weird, old taste to it. Not my fave. Also, I thought the fried plantains were just OK.   And please for the love of god stay away from the ensalada drink. It may sound tempting with the fresh apples and pineapple, but unless you literally enjoy shredded  lettuce in your drink, it's a no-go. It tasted overly sweet to me and really \"grassy\". Also, a few yelpers ordered this chicken dish and a steak dish covered with about a pound of onions and over-cooked to the point of not being able to cut with a knife. I'd steer clear of those, too. But hey, this place is known for it's pupusas, so order those!  I really want to come back and try the tamales and pastels, though. They looked delish! And you won't meet a sweeter lady than the owner. I'd definitely try this place if you love Salvadorian food! Oh, and did I mention it will be the cheapest dinner of your life? Yea, there's that, too."}
{"text":"The pupusas and tamales were out of this world. Everything was good too, from the fried whole fish to the chicharrones to the plantains and the yucca.   There's a minor language barrier but the place seems to be run by an adorable older woman and this tastes like home cooked food. It's not overly salty and it just tastes fresh. The accouterments were very nice, some pickled cabbage and peppers and some cornmeal patties with bean dip.   I would absolutely go again. The place isn't in the best area but on the inside it's charming and well kept if a bid outdated."}
{"text":"I love authentic ethnic food and I am so glad I found this place in my City.  This is like going into someone's house and having a meal from the soul.  The Pupusas are just so damned good!  I seriously think you are missing out if you don't have a meal here.  I had a tamale and just cried when thinking about how much I spent to have a designer tamale at El Carnicero.  A must eat."}
{"text":"Aargh...damn you La Casa Tazumal! Why did you have to stuff me and husband full of amazing pupusas, tamales, pastels, horchatas and cabbage for a measly $13.71?! Why was the service so wonderful that when the lady serving us saw our friends piling their leftover pupusas and cabbage into the same container, she insisted on getting them a plastic baggy for the cabbage so that the pupusas wouldn't get soggy?! Until yesterday, I was a Pupuseria La Bendicion girl all the way. Now, I can't decide which pupuseria I should be partial  to! Hmmm...that's not such a bad problem to have, is it? I can be partial to both! I am just going to have to eat twice as many pupusas in the future! Of course that is just so that I can be fair to both places...not because I am a glutton or anything. Aah...moral dilemma resolved. Now to chart up a calendar of future visits..."}
{"text":"I think I'm at a crossroads with my position as a Yelper. Last night, 9 overly critical food geeks (myself included) bombarded this cute little Salvadorian's house. By house, I am being literal because the kitchen and small dining room looks to be an add-on to her actual house. We were her only customer's for the night. If we didn't show up, La Casa Tazumal would not have made money that night. And by the end of the meal, here we are critiquing and picking apart this meal right in her very own house like we are judges on some sort of grueling, soulless food competition. What on earth have we become? It just didn't seem right. I felt dirty. You don't critique Thanksgiving dinner at Grandma's house after all.   We ordered Spanish Hot Chocolate to start. The first four of us received our drinks in old china tea cups with matching saucers. When a few more at the table ordered the same, it was served in a variety of other random tea cups. It wouldn't surprise me if the owner ran upstairs to retrieve more cups since I'm partially convinced this place has never served more than 4 cups of hot chocolate at the same time. But that could just be a theory.   Next, we ordered pupusas with curtido. Pupusas being a corn toritilla/flour pocket stuffed with pork and cheese. The curtido was a pickled cabbage. Together, along with a homemade hot sauce and sour cream were absolutely wonderful. Next came our entr√©es. Each of the 9 dishes came out separately at different times. Of course, being smallish place like this that most likely doesn't see this type of crowd on a regular basis, I wouldn't have expected everything to come out at the same time anyways, so this was certainly excusable. I ordered the fried plantains, rice and re-fried beans. Look, this isn't fancy, Michelin star-rated food, but my expectations weren't set to expect that. It was perfectly satisfying though. I felt plenty of love and tradition baked into this dish. Others at the table had empanadas and tamales while others ordered a basic steak or chicken dish. Needless to say the degree of satisfaction seemed varied. But I don't intend to speak for everyone else, only myself.  Overall, I felt like the \"grandma rule\" should be applied here. Anthony Bourdain speaks of it briefly in his new book, \"Medium Raw\". Paraphrasing from the book... You may not like Grandma's Thanksgiving turkey. It may be overcooked and dry- and her stuffing salty with rubbery pellets of giblets that you find unpalatable. You may not like the turkey at all. But it's Grandma's turkey. And you're at Grandma's house. So, you eat it. And afterward say, \"thank you Grandma, why yes, yes of course, I'd love seconds!\"  We at Yelp who write reviews, who judge and critique can often lose sight of what is truly important when we eat out as often as some of us do. Sitting at a house filled with love, sharing memories and experiences with others sometimes trumps that of perfect cuisine. Critiquing Grandma in her own house or dictating to Grandma what you will eat or won't eat based on some sort of veganistic food conscious beliefs is just wrong. I speak not of our group specifically, but to eaters as a whole. When you come to a place such as La Casa Tazumal, you come for the privilege to have Grandma cook for you. And to eat the type of food that she serves and has been a part of her heritage for generations.   It was an absolute privileged to be welcomed to La Casa Tazumal last evening to the welcoming arms of two of the most adorable woman I've ever had the chance to meet. Thank you and yes, yes of course I'll be back for seconds!"}
{"text":"La Casa Tazumal is right off Lorain on W 105th in a sleepy part of town with street parking. The outside isn't hard to miss, with a jungle creeping in the windows near the entrance. After entering the double doors, you're greeted to some Spanish Christian literature and a cozy dining area with plastic table clothes, food paintings and a booth selling herbal remedies.  Like others have said, the restaurant is run by an elderly woman with lots of spirit and seemingly fluent English. The menu is two pages, with a third page for dessert and miscellaneous a la carte items. Horchata and tamarindo is fresh and delicious, like dessert in a glass ($1.25).  I suppose the main draw here are the Salvadorean pupusas, which resemble Colombian arepas. Corn tortillas are split and stuffed with pork, beef, beans, cheese and other goodies. La Casa Tazumal's are slightly greasy, but definitely filling. For around $1.50 each, you can eat your fill of pupusas without denting your wallet.  We ate in the dining area, and the chef's daughter came half-way through and became our waitress in place of her mom. She brought out some pickled cabbage and other vegetables and a wonderful hot sauce. My boyfriend had a tamale, pupusas and empanada, although he had to pack up the empanada. Two pupusas and the horchata filled me up. We also ordered plantanos frito (fried plantain - $2.50). I thought it was going to be deep fried, sort of like yoyos or something, but it was a plantain, split down the center and caramelized. It was sweet and satisfying, but a little heavy for dessert. We packed it up for later.  La Casa Tazumal offers a lot of character and great, seemingly authentic Salvadorean cuisine. With many other menu options we didn't try, and a woman who's a triumph for opening her own restaurant and keeping a sweet demeanor the entire visit, we'll definitely be back again. This place could become a weekly staple."}
{"text":"Great authentic El salvadorian cuisine. Best in town! Small quaint restaurant ran by an extremely friendly El salvadorian lady with an atmosphere that reminds me of San Salvador. I have been coming here for several yeas and will continue to come back every time I visit my parents in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I was searching the internet for the pupusa spot on 105th a couple of weeks ago. I eventually asked my brother for the name and it was Pupusaria Labendicion. During my search, I found another restaurant on W 105th that serves Salvadoran food, La Casa Tazumal. I wanted to try this restaurant especially after I read this article on a local Hispanic on-line publication:   I think that you would love this restaurant...it is one of my favorites! The owner's name is Maria. She is from El Salvador. Her story is amazing. She lived there during the time of the Civil war and left because it was so bad. I totally recommend her restaurant. It is like a mom and pop's kind of place. She owns it and makes the food all by herself. It is a one woman show. But lately she hasn't been getting business. I went there yesterday with a friend and was her first customer for 2 days...she was on the verge to cry...poor thing...She is a sweetie.....If you can pass this email along...:) gracias...    The article broke my heart. I knew that I would soon visit this restaurant and tonight was a perfect time to do so. The owner was the sweetest woman that I have met in such a long time. She was the type of person who just exuded kindness and had a pleasant nature. My friend who is normally stoic said that he just wanted to hug her before we left. I didn't even tell him about the sad article. The pupusas here were just as good as they are down the street. The spicy cabbage, or curtido (wiki'd it) was an excellent addition to the pupusa. The fried plantains were awesome. The tamale was ok. My friend ordered the bistec and a few sides and all were good. They do not take credit card, so bring cash. I must inform you that not much is needed as each pupusa is $1.50 and realistically, two can fill you up in a pinch. The other food is good too, so bring a little bit more."}
{"text":"\"Ding\"  There goes the microwave.  I have been in a pupusa rage lately and am trying to hit up every pupuseria in town (I actually think there are two?).  I can't say that I'm a pupusa expert, but I know a good pupusa when I see one.  I didn't really see one at Casa Tasumal though.  Upon entering, there are lush green plants, bright green and orange walls and actual tablecloths!  There is a little, and not as grandmothery woman as I was expected, lady standing by the doorway wringing her hands in anticipation.  Service was excellent and she was very friendly, I was just a little disappointed with the food.  I'm pretty sure the pupusas were microwaved, the slaw was obviously not fresh and was more of a sauerkraut (maybe that's what she's going for?), plus the cheese pupsusa was very plain and just filled with probably frozen mozzarella.  Now, none of this was bad.  Not at all actually, we were very happy.  I just know that two blocks down the street there are fresher ingredients being used.    Would I come back again?  Absolutely.  I think the atmosphere is great and much more attune to groups of people and a nicer night out."}
