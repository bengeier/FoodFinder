{"text":"This place is awful. I really can't believe it is a restaurant chain/franchise. The decor is not modern but not rustic either. Just not sure what the theme is. The service stuff is not well trained, had no energy, and they look like they had always worked in places like Swiss Chalet.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with Swiss Chalet but this is a $100/couple dining place and I certainly expecting The Keg like standard. After taking our drink order(but all we had was water), our waitress took 15 to 20 min before coming back to take our orders. The breads were diner grade dinner rolls. Where the heck are we?  Denny's?  The dinner took over 30 min to come for a party of six and four were sub par. The veg. in the salads were dry and not fresh. The cooked veg. side was also very dry and felt like it has been sitting in a warming container for a long time. Two steaks were over cooked. The pasta looked and tasted terrible.  The prime rib was decent and the chicken looked good.  The waitress never asked if we wanted fresh ground pepper or anything and left.  The service was not 'lousy' but was totally unimpressive. Their direct competitors, namely The Keg and Baton Rough, are ten times better in providing a decent dining experience."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant because of the proximity of our hotel. The food was ok, but the overall experience was a disaster. The table was setup,but dirty. And worst of all the staff were amazingly arrogant. We have an 11 year old picky eater, she wanted to see the kids menu; the manager asked her age and refused to give her a kids menu since it's for 10 years old only. Wow really accommodating. We will never go back"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes (with a reservation) on a Sunday evening. Was served a cold and tasteless prime rib. Two other steaks had to be sent back because they were not cooked properly. Service was ok (waiter left while taking our order to serve other guests food-I've never seen that before). Millefeuille was as good as I remember it.  Not sure if my palette has matured or if the restaurant has diminished since I was a child."}
{"text":"I came to the Bifteque with my group of 7 coworkers with low expectations - I left with even less of a favourable opinion. 

The waiter took all our orders correctly but that's the last positive comment I have to say.

He forgot my salad and when it finally arrived the \"italian vinaigrette\" was horrible.

We looked forward to when our meat arrived but oh boy we're we going to regret it. Three of the seven orders were incorrect and all of the steaks were severely undercooked.

We're debating right now whether or not to stay for dessert. Probably not."}
{"text":"The second time was as charming, even though I dined alone at the bar. Attentive and quick, even with a huge private party. 

Prime rib was tender and cooked as ordered.  This place will make me dedicate hours at the gym.

According to staff, reservations or patience are needed for weekend dining."}
{"text":"Foremost, if you are mobility challenged this place was not for you to dine. Access with a wheelchair was impossible, a walker was better but you still needed to walk up at least 4 steps to gain access to any room other than the sushi shop in the main entrance. Worse off was the washrooms were all in the basement with really steep steps. This issue was not important until last year when we decided to celebrate my dad's 86th birthday. Having suffered several strokes in the past 5 years he requires at wheeled walker, what we experienced on our visit was extremely unfortunate as well very unprofessional, more on that in a bit.

The relationship between this branch of the chain has been one bitter-sweet since it's hay days in the 80's when the Ponderosa restaurants disappeared from the scene, Le Biftheque pretty much was the go-to place for a family or birthday party to enjoy steak. Most of the time wait staff were not the most pleasant, almost bitter to be working, a few times my steaks were not done to my asking. So when they re-opened last year we decided to give it another chance.

We arrived at the front entrance realizing the first dining room was out of reach with the number of stairs needed to climb was akin to asking my father to climb Mount Royal, so we headed to the other rooms in the middle but this time there was the stairs about 5 or 6 to navigate. We noticed a ramp that was leaning against the wall, so my brother and I unhooked it so dad could use that to bypass the stairs. As soon as it was unhooked, the hostess started to yell at us in French that the ramp was for employees only!! I replied back in English that we were here to celebrate our dad's 86th birthday that he cannot negotiate stairs. She continued to rail us in French not offering an alternative manner to reach at the dining room. After several minutes of hoisting our dad up the stairs we arrived at our table when he needed to use the washroom. I asked our hostess where can he go? She continued in French that the washrooms were in the basement!! At this point I threw my hands in the air blasting her are you kidding me??? I then exclaimed that I guess we better go to another restaurant!! At this point a very friendly waitress came to me with a loving touch of my arm \"I will take your father to the employee washroom near the kitchen\". Thank you compassionate waitress, screw you bitter, bitchy unhostess!! With the aging, loyal clientel that long supported this place, a small elevator is a must if they decide to re-open!!

Our meal was just OK, nothing to write home about, but what we had to go through just to arrive at our table was enough that we never went back.

I am glad to see however the Boucherville branch has placed ads in media that they are unaffected by the Cote-de-Liesse closing. I am not sure if they are the original operators of the branch that was there 20 years ago, but I will say this, it was a much more tightly run ship than the Montreal place. Perhaps the clientel are far more demanding & unforgiving when it comes to service and food quality. I will be making a pilgrimage very soon to Boucherville to see if my haunch is spot on, will write on the appropriate page."}
{"text":"I live in LA but every time I come back to Montreal I drop by Biftheque to pick up their Montreal steak spice. I use it for EVERYTHING. Especially burgers. Burgers with Biftheque steak spice are always a huge hit, especially if you have fresh ground beef."}
{"text":"Okay, let's be realistic here, you don't go for the gourmet food to Le Biftheque, you come for the quantity of food and that's what they deliver... quantity! Sometimes it makes you wonder if this is an attempt to kill you with food. It very well might be. One of the few times that I can say that the food was definitely undersalted. The onion blossom could have used a bit of salt and so could the shrimps. The mille feuilles was a touch overly sweet, but delicious. The steak fries... delicious. The piece of blue cheese in the salad was big enough to see!

Our waitress's English was passable, service was quick and efficient. Water was always filled and service came with a smile. The decor around here is simply.. paint it black so no one notices we have walls and a ceiling. Paper tablecloths remind you that this is a trough instead of a fine dining establishment. And it does do what they promise, deliver a lot of food for a good price.

Which of course leaves us with questions like... where do you get a potato that is a quarter the size of Prince Edward Island? Do you have a handtruck to roll me out to the car with? And is there enough garlic in the garlic croutons?"}
{"text":"We were there with a party of about 15. The room was nicely done, and the service was impeccable and friendly.
We had rib steaks, which in spite of the lavish garlic and spices was virtually tasteless and had an odd texture. It was cooked as requested but was very disappointing. The salmon ordered by our friends was  good. So in this steakhouse, the rib steak is not the best dish. Amazing.
In addition the dessert was below standard.
We will not be returning to the Biftheque."}
{"text":"As you walk in your impressed by the lobby and well arranged store front. Sadly after waiting three times the length the host said it would take we were escorted to sub par dining room.
Service was lacking, waiter was brief and short on manors.
We ordered a number of different courses and found them to be middle of the road in flavor and taste.
The salads were tasty as a perk.
Portions were large and drinks were good as a plus..on the way out you get yummy mints."}
{"text":"Been there a few times in the last couple of months and I love it. The food is always amazing and 3 out of the 4 times I have been there the service was unbelievable. They have crazy cheap deals and they post them on Facebook. The only bad experience I had was a few weeks ago for all you can eat ribs night. We waited over 30 min for our table even tho we had a reservation and after we placed our orders and ate our salads the waiter came back to tell us that they had ran out of pork ribs. I had to take the beef ribs and they are so huge and fatty that I couldn't enjoy it. I was very disappointed and also the waiter was so not the greatest at all. They have the best milles feuilles so make sure to keep some room for dessert. To make sure you have a great experience and you go there and its all you can eat ribs go before 7pm if not the steak is to die for and so are the prices."}
{"text":"I remember feeling a little sad when the downtown branch closed and then seeing that the main restaurant near the airport had shut down due to bankruptcy... But they're back (not downtown though...) and their steaks are as good as ever!

I recently popped over with my family and 'enjoyed' the onion blossom (waaaaayyyy too much oil for my liking) followed by a filet mignon with mashed potatoes which were to die for! Everyone on our table had a different cut of meat and we had nothing but good things to say about our steaks (prime roast, filet mignon, t-bone, rib steak..). Price is super decent for a steak house. The only negative is it's out-of-the-way location and maybe decor..oh, and not to mention their terrible mille feuille which is pretty much cream and custard in one feuille.... Haha really really badly done...

Otherwise great steak!"}
{"text":"Short version:  Thousands upon thousands of pounds of beef.  Limited selection of Eisenhower-era cuts.  Good prices.

If you're a serial eater of barbequed striploin or rib steak, brisket, beef ribs, of filet mignon, you probably won't need to go anywhere else to fill your freezer.  Entire striploins are sold as 2-foot long monobloc logs, at a price often 60% or 70% of what the foodstore meat counter wants.  And, they'll cut your meat log to order, at whatever thickness you specify and packaged however you like, gratis. The ribs steaks, too.  I get my entire summer's weekend steaks there, every spring.  Inch and a quarter thick.

They're also the only place I've found that sells *large* pieces of uncooked corned beef in brine.  They offer similarly-uncooked pickled tongues and veal rolls, too.  If you're a corned beef-deprived Montrealer who needs a bit of a respite from smoked meat, drop everything and go buy one of their big, bloody bags of salt brisket.  Simmer it up at home in your biggest cauldron; save the stock for a mind-boggling pea soup.

Their smoked chickens and turkeys are worth a try, if you're into that.  Sold ready-to-eat.  There'll sometimes be half-chickens and quarter-turkeys on the shelves, too, especially around Xmas.

Really good prices on bacon.  I can afford to use bacon as a seasoning, because of this place.

Last little tip:  Try their steak spice.  Big bottle goes for, I think, 7 bucks.  Fantastic as part of a marinade, with either white vermouth or pale ale.  Not as salty as the foodstore brands.  Has a definite Rue St-Laurent flavor to it.

This place is a regular stop for me.  They'd get more stars if they had more than five cuts of beef on offer;  I'd buy bavette, rump steak, and porterhouses all day long, at their price levels.  But, since I'm a little round-heeled slut for a striploin or rib steak done right, and I own a barbeque, they've got me."}
{"text":"Attente de 2 h quand on nous dit 45 minutes, un steak froid et cru, salade ordinaire, ribs ordinaire, un repas ordinaire alors que nous nous attendions à mieux. On ne retournera vraiment pas. Y'a mieux ailleurs."}
{"text":"Went in on Friday night 10 pm for a nice meal that didn't happen. The host was no where to be found had to walk around and find someone to be seated. -asked for the drink menu never got one... My steak had so many veins and ligaments in it I couldn't cut it. They brought me rice instead of fries as well. When I asked for my bill I was very upset told the waitor I'm not impressed at all he pretty much told me to F off! I asked to talk to the manager he took down my info - hasn't called me yet, what disgusting service. Never again"}
{"text":"The original owner is back and the food was delicious. We were there for a party of 10, everyone enjoyed their meal, the service was good and the rooms were nicely decorated. The sushi seems out if place in a steakhouse, but overall a great place for a great steak dinner at a fair price."}
{"text":"Good place to eat a steak. Nothing more than that. Very pricey. Decor is outdated. Food is above average.

Not great, but good. 

For the money, there are better options"}
{"text":"Thank god this place is closed down. It used to be good many years ago but when I went back I was extremely dissapointed. My steak had ligaments in it and I was unable to chew through that. The waiter was very rude and it took hours to get our food. We ordered drinks we never got them. The only good thing was the garlic croutons that's it."}
{"text":"wow... I had the 18 oz classic steak.... perfectly cooked and the meat was so tender.. I found it it extremely cheap for the quality of food and services you get. 
Even though it was very busy, the service was very fast.. thumbs UP"}
{"text":"Meat was okay, shrimps were amazing.  Food was very greasy. Big portions."}
{"text":"We stopped here at the recommendation of our hotel.   It was pretty disappointing.   My steak was tough, and the prime rib my guest ordered look fatty and just not very appetizing.    The service was ok, the decor ok, but I would not go back."}
{"text":"Le filet mignon était un vrai délice, les baby back ribs de mon chum étaient bons aussi, mais un peu carbonisés par exemple. Le décor est vraiment beau dans les tons de noir.
Le service laissait un peu à désirer, les commandes étaient melées, les factures aussi. Je crois qu'on a tombé sur la mauvaise serveuse, elle avait l'air perdue pas mal dans ses affaires.
Mais ça fut quand même une belle expérience."}
{"text":"There was a special here that allowed you to get a rack of ribs with salad and side for $10 or a prime rib with the same options starting at $13.  The price for the prime rib varied depending on the size.  Taking advantage of this I decided to give it a go.

I started with a caesar salad and an onion flower which is basically like onion rings except the onion is arranged in a flower like formation.  The salad was pretty good although the croutons were a little greasy and the onion flower needed some more salt.   

I opted for the ribs and the portion was huge!  They also came with a sizeable amount of garlic mashed potatoes.  The ribs had a smoky taste to them and were pretty tender.  They weren't super warm though when they were served which was a bit of a letdown.  The mashed potatoes were pretty good.  

Service was fine.  The place was packed but everything came within a reasonable amount of time.  Overall the restaurant is ok but not great.  If you're in the area it's worth going but I sure wouldn't make a detour to come here."}
{"text":"Le Biftheque is a landmark restaurant in the area, and still seems to be popular even though it's attracting an older crowd for dinner these days. Their take on steak is more traditional than some newer places, but the good news is that it's a winning formula for great classic flavors. 

My prime rib was aged and cooked to perfection, delicious! Couple that with a large salad, and huge loaded baked potato, and you have a really good meal for not alot of pesos

The entry is newer, but the dining room is dark and gloomy. At least our friendly server was able to lighten it up for us. Go for the steak, not the ambiance, and you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Probably the best dining option if you are staying in the Trudeau (YUL) airport vicinity. 

For this very reason I dined here quite a few times. 

Value: If you Yelp other steakhouses in the area you will find that Le Bifthque is about $10 cheaper that everyone else. $19.99 for a16 oz  Ribeye and a side is a steal!

The steaks are prepared the purest way (no seasoning). If you want it prepared with garlic and their signature seasoning, you need to ask for it. (lesson learned) 
When in Montreal have a steak done with Montreal spice right? So thats what i did on all subsequent visits. 
I have heard through the grapevine (mostly others sitting at the bar) that this place was a Montreal landmark and people would come for miles to eat here and that the quality has dropped. 
Well not being able to compare the past I can assure you that they are grilling a quality steak today. 

The only things that i was not a huge fan of were the calamari appetizer which was a little sloppy and uber greasy. 
The baked potato as well was a miss for me as it was more of a hybrid between a baked potato and mashed potato. You had the nice crispy skin but mashed potato guts. Not how I like it but hey, it's a matter of opinion. 

As mentioned in the beginning, the best option near the airport and the surrounding hotels. 

+1* for being open late. 

Eat with confidence!"}
