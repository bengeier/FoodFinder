{"text":"Had lunch with my wife here.  She's Colombian and felt it had some traditional Colombian flavors with more modern simple dishes.  I mention the Colombian part as there are really no restaurants close by with rice, beans, sweet plantains, empanadas, and steak.  Was very good quick and attentive service.  For $5.99 she got the dinner portion with soup.  I tried the grilled chicken over salad with avocados beans and corn was delicious and will definitely go here again.   One of the reviews picked up food for take out and I understand his feelings as haven eaten many Colombian meals prepared by her Mom, her aunts, many places in Florida, Puerto Rico and in Dominican Republic this food is just best eaten right away.  Try it out, for the area it's great to have another option other than BBQ, Chinese, or pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent new addition to the area.  Chicken has more of a South American seasoning and is very tasty!  The corn and green beans were truly southern and tasted like grandmas.  The yucca and plantains had great flavor and texture.  Filling in deep fried empanadas was very tasty.  Great sauces provided to complement meal.  Look forward to many more visits!  Well done Mr. Pollo!"}
{"text":"Edible but nothing to write home about. The food needs more flavor and I'm not sure they are making these items in-house as it appears they may be popped out of a freezer or can. All the other similar places in Charlotte are so flavorful. I hope they add some seasoning to their items (keep in mind I come from a salt-free household, so these items are super bland) and use fresh ingredients.   This is our second visit and I will say we enjoyed the rice/beans and plantains. I just hope they make some adjustments as I would love to see their business thrive."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today and got takeout. Staff was great and the dining room was very clean. The lunch special i got came with a ton of food and it was about 9 dollars! Food tastes very good and athentic. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped on a sat evening, other myself getting take out one table of 3. I got the half chicken. Leg and wing we're ok, skin had flavor but soggy. Breast was extremely dry and very little flavor. The rice and veggies were bland white rice with a mix of frozen niblet size veggies. Think tv dinner. The plantains were some how dry yet greasy. The green sauce, mild, was chunky with a odd flavor. Overall a less than average chicken with nothing  fresh or flavor to  die for. Nothing gourmet here other than name.  Rating 1, maybe a 2 for price and fast service not quality or flavor. Put this place on your drive somewhere else  in Indian Land for your chicken fix."}
{"text":"This has become one of our go to's for take out. Everything on the menu that we have tried has been exceptional. The wrap is full of so much flavor!  Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed. I am glad we did!!"}
{"text":"I thought the chicken was very tasty but there wasn't enough of it for my family.  I guess we'll have to order more next time :)  The plantains were delicious!    We went here last minute but it was worth it.  Most importantly, there wasn't a huge crowd.  We were served right away.  Staff was very friendly and professional. I will go here again.  Next time I will look at the menu more carefully.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Deeeeelicious! Soup is phenomenal! Everything is amazing here. Staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Very good and lite. Very friendly people working there. Great place to eat and great prices."}
{"text":"Good flavorable chicken at Mr Pollo!  The lunch special includes a bowl of soup, the sides are small. Two plantains and side salad, the bleu cheese is good, it blended well with a spicy sauce they brought to the table.  The grilled beef steak is tasty but a tad chewy.  Chicken is the way to go.  The drinks are 2$, refills at the station, the order is taken at the counter and a friendly staff member brings your order to the table with a smile.  Small, clean spot in the plaza."}
{"text":"Flavorful food- always tend to get the lunch special, which rotates different items from steak to chicken but no matter what, it is always delicious! Stop in! Everyone was very nice and helpful when it came to my questions. Food delicious and prices are extremely fair!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch after hearing it was open. Staff was exceptional, food was fast and very good. Had the lunch special and I missed out on pictures cause I ate it so fast. Great chicken, and the sauces made it better."}
{"text":"I loved Casa Columbia, sorry to see it close, but Mr. Pollo picks up where it left off. Friendly Staff, quick service and clean inside. Chicken was cooked to perfection.Got 1/2 chicken, with black beans and green plantains, it was way too much food. Green plantains were the best I ever had but thought the black bean were kind of bland. The green and red sauces were tasty, but they need a hotter salsa. Might daughter had the empanadas which were very good, but the sauce that came with them was unbelievable. Mr Pollo blows away Viva Chicken (over rated)!"}
{"text":"LOVED IT!!! If you haven't been to this restaurant yet you need to try it. My husband and I got take out from here last night and we were very happily surprised. We ordered the 6 piece family meal that's priced at $25, and we had a $5 coupon. We assumed we would get maybe a breast, a wing and a couple of thighs and drums, but when we got home we were shocked to see that we got 3 breast halves with the wings attached and 3 chicken leg quarters- an entire chicken and a half! The meal came with 3 sides. We got a house salad which was fresh crisp romaine lettuce with some carrots onion and cheese that was large enough for us to both have a good sized portion, green beans that were hot and flavorful...a little on the salty side for my taste but still good, and yucca fries which were thick cut, perfectly fried, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and sooo tasty! We've had some pretty bad yucca fries, even at nice Cuban restaurants before, but these really hit the mark. The roasted chicken was flavorful and juicy and the sauces that they included were absolutely amazing! I thought this place was going to have a Mexican flavor, but it's definitely more Cuban and such a nice addition to the food choices in this area. It's an order at the counter kind of place, but the dining room was clean and comfortable. Definitely updated since the previous place in this location. They have many choices for sides and even a burger plate on the menu, so please, please visit this restaurant and give it a chance. I'd hate to see it go out of business like so many other restaurants  in this area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing !!! I love it I can't get enough I go here all the time and there sides are the best. Tonight my wife was sick and I knew only one thing would make her feel better and that was the chicken noodle soup they have!!! It is Bomb dot com it has cilantro chicken corn and big noodles and lots of chicken !! Go here for lunch or dinner you will be satisfied guaranteed!"}
{"text":"Service is always sweet, sauces are delicious and the chicken is ALWAYS moist and crispy (the best combination).  The only con is that the pieces are a little smaller than expected but the prices are cheap and they have Groupons!"}
{"text":"Went for a take out family meal and was extremely disappointed.   From the non welcoming atmosphere by staff (you should take extreme pride in your product) chicken was overly salty and not flavorful at all. If the chicken is the spotlight of this establishment it was not the star.  Meaning, the chicken tasted old and I hate soggy steamed skin on chicken (which kept being reheated as it was dry) The empanadas tasted old and not with a crunchy fresh taste.  First and last time we will be eating at this establishment.  Save your money and try something else."}
{"text":"We got take out from here the other day and wAs not impressed at all. The chicken was so dry it was inedible. Green beans had a weird flavor and were mushy. Rice had no flavor. It was around 5:30pm, so I hate to see what the late diners were served. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because my husband liked the empanadas. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Our first time there just now. Good first impression. My husband is one of the worlds pickiest eaters and he loved it. This is a very unassuming place and we will definitely be back. The chicken was moist with great flavor and the sweet plantains were delicious. Glad to have another quick and easy place to eat so close"}
{"text":"Went here for a take-out dinner for the family.  Ordered the largest order of six pieces of chicken including three sides.  Pieces were half a chicken each so we ended  up with one and a half chickens.  This is in the former Casa Colombia restaurant that recently went out-of-business.  In the Food Lion supermarket strip shopping enter along Hwy 521 in Indian Land.  Very popular with the Latino population which was there in droves.  Entire families eating in as well as taking out.  Sides included sweet and green plantains, rice and beans and other Central and South American items.  There were also some conventional sides, such as potatoes, rice and string beans.  The chicken, to us, was nothing special.  It was grilled and nicely cooked and coated with a mildly spicy treatment.  But it was expensive, especially compared to grocery store chicken and the Colonel's and we would call it rather blah.  Overall, it rated an A-OK rating of three stars. And that is all.  The serving and cooking crew appeared to be Colombian which I verified by asking the cashier in Spanish.  Hence the sides offered.   If you plan on eating inside, it is crowded.  Metal tables fill the entry/eating area.  You order and pick-up at the counter..Menu is on the wall above the cashiers and there are printed cards that  you can use or take with you.  It is very clean and the staff are neatly uniformed, groomed and friendly as well as helpful.  Very simple operation and other than the grilled chicken there are salads and empanadas (meat with potato stuffed pies).  And certainly, there are beverages.  Don't understand how it is \"gourmet\" chicken.  It is just grilled.  I wish them success, and given the Latino population in the area it stands a good chance.  That said, the menu is limited and the sides are unusual for the non-Latino population of Indian Land.  Couple that with the higher prices charged, and they might be making some menu and price changes."}
{"text":"You ever play \"I'm feeling lucky\" with Yelp? That is, search on Yelp for a lunch spot nearby and blindly go to the first result? I've had it backfire a couple of times, but Mr. Pollo was a win in my book. Fast, inexpensive, delicious. It was enough for me to stop by both times I've been to Indian Land in the last two weeks.  Walked in last week around 1pm to a relatively crowded small restaurant. It's about the size of your average Chinese take-out but with nice tables and a long high-top in the middle. The counter is clean and modern, with large TV screens featuring their menu choices.  On my first visit I got the Arroz Con Pollo: Yellow Rice, Shredded Chicken, and mixed vegetables. Also served with your choice of a side, I got the sweet plantains. Rice and chicken was fantastic, moist and full of flavor. The sweet plantains were dialed back on the sweetness, kind of refreshing compared to a lot of Latin American restaurants around here. Served with a tangy and spicy sauce, the former similar to a chimichurri sauce.  Second visit I went for the Lunch Special and for the price it was good. You get a soup, choice of a protein, and two sides. The soup today was Chicken soup. It had a wholesome flavor and seasoned nicely, but I only found one sliver of chicken. Would have been better listed as a Veggie and potato soup. The chicken was lacking  a lot of flavor on its own, much different from the portion served in the Arroz Con Pollo, but also a cheaper menu option. Perfect rice that went well with the aforementioned sauces. For what it was, it was filling and satisfying.  If one opened up around UNC-Charlotte I'd be a regular for sure. Great food and good staff, well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Eat here at least once a week!  Great food, always fresh and great service. The roasted chicken is moist and flavorful, green beans,  black beans and rice are yummy.  The Arroz con Pollo is delicious and full of chicken. Don't forget the light green sauce,  I put it on everything from the salad to the chicken!"}
{"text":"This is a Colombian street food restaurant. Many of the sides are authentic as well as daily specials. Food is very delicious not to mention the natural juices. The service is fantastic and the prices are on point. Perfect spot for lunch.  Will definitely come back to try the other options!!!"}
{"text":"Took family hoping it was comparable to Pollo Tropical but I was wrong. Food was ok nothing to brag about might have been better if it was hot when it came to table. Also would have been better had all the food came out at same time. We had the 1/4 with two sides and two Ceasars salads so yeah most definitely could have all arrived at the same time. There was nothing gourmet about their chicken--Sam's Club Rotisserie Chicken is way more flavorful."}
{"text":"I love chicken so Mr. Pollo, gourmet chicken intrigued  my dining mate and I  to try to the chicken. The restaurant is small but clean and bright. Staff very friendly and accommodating.  One orders from the counter and food is brought to the table . ,My dining mate ordered the special , a quarter of the chicken , white rice, with plantains and chicken soup as the 2 sides . on the special.  I ordered a 1/2 of chicken with 2 sides of my choice, green beans and a small house salad . My dining mate also  ordered a blackberry juice drink which was made  fresh on the premises in the morning .  While we waited we were offered a  complimentary beef and potato filled empanada . The empanada was delicious and came with 2 types of spicy sauces . Our food orders came shortly after . Food was plated  nicely and hot . The black Berry fruit drink was delicious . The chicken soup was bland but satisfying. Orders of our chickens were satisfactory , dark meat much moister than white breast meat. Our chicken seemed lightly grilled , no discerning seasonings or hint of smoke on the skin or meat. The fried sweet plantains were delicious . Nothing special about the sides of green beans which seemed canned,  the small house salad or white rice. Reasonable portions and prices . The kids menu featured chicken nuggets with french  fries  and a cheese burger with fries. We would probably return and try something else from the menu . Over all wholesome food but basically the chicken needs a little bit more flavor in our opinion."}
{"text":"The food is good, but they are a little slow and pricy for what you get.  I recommend calling your order in advance so you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"My wife and I didn't really feel like the traditional restaurant dinner experience tonight. Thus searching for something close to home. Browsing through Yelp we found Mr. Pollo. All the reviews were glowing, and it just recently opened so we decided to try it out.  The storefront looks like a pizza joint from the parking lot, though the store signage is definitely more elegant than it's neighbors. Don't be fooled though.  The chicken is EXCELLENT and the sides are not shabby either. We both had the 1/4 chicken w/ 2 sides - house salad and green beans for my wife - house salad and sweet plantain for me. They offer a handful of dips for the chicken that are pretty good, though the chicken in our opinion needs nothing additional. My wife also had a side order of yarro - I now like yarro. We chose the blackberry natural juice made in house and it like the rest of the meal was excellent.  The menu is limited, possibly one of the reasons why what they do offer is of high quality and such a great deal. The facility is clean and the staff courteous. It's not a place you're going to visit everyday, but when you want something healthier than the fast food joints and similarly priced; especially on those days you just don't feel like preparing food at home. Then Mr. Pollo should be at the top of your list."}
{"text":"Love the concept, extremely clean, variety of lunch options, good pricing, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! It's quick, easy & delicious! Everything I have had so far has been amazing. You will not be disappointed. The chicken is delicious and you have to get the sauces! Always order the empanadas! And ask about the soup - it changes daily. I've ha a few different soups here and they were all delicious."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, answer all your questions.  They even asked if I would like to try an empanada on the house after telling them how much I love them.  The rotisserie chicken was seasoned very well.  Found the string beans to be a little on the salty side.  The black & red beans were very good.  The offer 2 dipping sauces.  The red sauce which is the hot sauce had a strange after taste.  The green salsa verde sauce was very good, I'd stick with that sauce over the red."}
{"text":"Definitely a hole in the wall! Service is quick and friendly and the food is awesome. The flavor of the chicken is fantastic. For sides, the fries are nice and crispy and definitely have that satisfying crunch. The yuca fries are soft and dense exactly what a yuca fry should be. The empanadas are definitely one of the things that got me absolutely hooked! The flavor is fantastic. Then there's the green beans and those are amazing as well! The prices are fair for what you get and I'm always coming back for more."}
{"text":"6 paper bags (reusing for my regular shopping) and counting of Mr. Pollo.  The chicken Waaay fresher and healthier. Can it use a little more latin season. Yes than again i don't want too much high sodium. The whole point is to eat and be healthy.  & No you won't find freshly made Delicious Empanadas at local supermarkets."}
{"text":"So we went back after our first two disappointments, mostly because we agreed the black beans were freakin' delicious (my wife is Cuban so knows black beans!). To our delight, the Chicken was really good this time, very moist and seasoned, flavorful. Someone got the message. So we went again, and delicious again.  I went back to buy a family meal to take home, and again, delicious. Yay, so glad they fixed the dry chicken. We'll be back again and again. Please keep the Quality high, you're only as good as the last meal."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The staff is friendly, their empanadas are great and their sauces are top notch!"}
