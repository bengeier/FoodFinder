{"text":"Elevated juice has the best tasting juice ive had in the valley. The coffee is first class and the staff is freindly and knowledgeable. It is worth the drive."}
{"text":"By far the best place to get an Acai Bowl in Vegas! The staff is pleasant and the Acai bowl had the yummiest flavor! They are generous with portions and the packaging is nice!"}
{"text":"Did a one day cleanse from here- everything tastes delicious. I would definitely recommend this place. It's about time that there is a real pressed juice bar up this way."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. There aren't very many juice places in NLV let alone great juice places. I have never had a problem with wait time, but I mostly buy the readymade juices. Each juice I've had has been delicious and refreshing. I'm currently on a 3 day cleanse and not a single juice has been a choke down, get it out of the way drink. They also have a \"punch\" card where you can earn free juices! I will be coming back as long as they are open."}
{"text":"Best new place! Owners are great, smoothies, cold presses juice, Acai bowls, coffee... Everything is on point. So happy to have elevated juice open.  We are regulars now. :)"}
{"text":"First time visit today. Staff was very friendly and answered all questions I had. Drinks were delicious and made quickly. They even threw in a free cold coffee sample. Going to start making this a regular stop"}
{"text":"They let you sample they're juices and needless to say it's fresh and amazingly good. Plenty of parking. I live by Sunrise mtn and yes I wil travel here and pick up refreshment and snacks for road trips. Keep up the great work @Elevated Juice."}
{"text":"I was craving an Acai Bowl but didn't want to travel to Summerlin to get one so I pulled up yelp and was stoked to find out that Elevated Juice was much closer and just opened recently! The store had a really cool interior design and Vince was very helpful offering us advice and a few free samples of their products (the pecan pie smoothie was amazing!) I ordered the Acai Bowl and it was easily the best I have had since I moved here from Hawaii. My girlfriend ordered the Strawberry Fields smoothie and it was delicious as well. Overall, it was a great experience with friendly service and pure fruit products that taste great without a bunch of added sugar! I'd highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Okay, So I will start with the positive. The smoothies taste amazing. They are a little pricey but they are large so i'm willing to accept that.   The negative.  They advertise pitaya, yet every time I order it they are out. Super annoying. I normally get my pitaya bowls at another local place which offers alot for the price. However, today I decided to try a pitaya bowl from here. Immediately I am told they are out of pitaya...of course. So, I ordered the acai bowl. HUGE disappointment. The acai was soup. It was straight liquid. I mixed up all the fruit and the ridiculous amount of granola (the bottom of the bowl AND the top of the bowl were covered) into my soupy bowl so it would be edible without a straw. I paid over $10 for something I did not enjoy and didn't even finish. I would not order again."}
{"text":"Love the location would much rather give my money to local business than Starbucks or tropical smoothie but please please start offering more dairy alternatives !! Some  people have nut allergies and also can't drink whole milk or almond milk these are the only two options they have!! There pressed juice is bomb and staff is very freindly! Hope they have more options soon!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  I've discovered their Sweet Greens smoothie.  It's so good, I get it without the added Agave.  The samples of juices are always very good also.  I've yet to taste a sample that wasn't great.  My kids always steal my green smoothie."}
{"text":"Tried to finally stop by while running errands, closed at 6:17pm, hours said open everyday until 7pm....  One of the worst pet peeves. If there's an emergency or you're out of something at least leave a note rather than me pulling at the door wondering when I can try this local juice..."}
{"text":"This is an awesome, new juice spot that has amazing juices! Staff is super nice and will let you try any juice you want. The \"elevate\" juice is my personal favorite!"}
{"text":"Sad to have to go from a 5 to a 2, but the classic acai bowl I always get has went down from my last 2 visits. My wife originally recommended this place so I was intrigued as I'm always in search of the best acai bowl. When I came the first time it was a family working that day with a young girl on the register. I believe the mother made the bowls or father/gentleman that was also working that day. Anyway, the bowls were great. On my next visit there was just one guy working when we came and the bowl was okay. This visit the bowl was unfortunately really terrible. The acai tasted watered down and there were old bananas in our bowls which I had to have switched out for fresh one's. Not sure why at $10 a bowl (not a cheap treat) why old bananas were used in the first place. Let me reiterate that the acai was VERY WATERY, maybe trying to save money by watering down the ingredients. Also, since I've had 3 bowls within the past 3 weeks I can tell ingredients were also missing. Very disappointed driving from Henderson."}
{"text":"Nut is milk is really stinking good; juices are legit too but you will definitely pay for them! Employees are friendly and knowledgeable as well.   When they first opened, I stopped by 3 or 4 times after working out (around 0830 or 0900 - they said they opened at 0800) and they were not open once. They are under new management as of July though and apparently open at 0700 everyday now!"}
{"text":"Crazy expensive and the berry beet juice tasted like literally eating dirt. Somethings should just never be in a smoothie, beets are one. I was disgusted to see an employee drink out of the blender after making the smoothie blend. I'd never return here, so disgusting. Go to smoothie king instead."}
{"text":"I had the absolute juice OMG  I highly recommend it!! The place smells so good.. and very clean.. I will be returning lol.."}
{"text":"I'd been looking for a place with legit a√ßai bowls in Vegas. Took me 4 years but Elevated Juice's are on par with Hawai'i's! The pitaya bowls are delicious too!"}
{"text":"This review is mainly for the customer service and quality.  I had been driving around looking for something good to drink, didn't want anything from a drive thru/ fast food place. My body didn't want a sugary fix and I didn't want anything to eat. Picky, picky, picky. Suddenly I remembered a yelp review for a juice place opposite all the junk food, I spotted it and hoped they had smoothies. It was Sunday afternoon and it was pretty quiet. Feeling adventurous and excited to try a new place, I walked into a spotless store with very wholesome looking decor and where there was stainless steel it shone. I was pleased that it didn't look like a fast food joint. I was greeted by two very lean looking guys. It turns out I was in the right place for a healthy drink because the upbeat guy behind the counter (wish I'd caught his name) was very passionate about the juices they made and insisted I try them. I'm pretty shy and didn't want to be rude so I went with it. They were delicious!!! I could actually taste each ingredient on the description label for the juices. My smoothie was not overly sweet like Jamba or Tropical Smoothie and it wasn't weird and pulpy either.  I was amazed at how GOOD everything was. We chatted a little about cleanses, a friend at work had been pleading for a buddy to join her but I was skeptical about drinking vegetables for three days. I mean you could just go buy V8 I had teased her. I was totally wrong. I came in for a smoothie and left educated and taste buds clamoring for more. You could say I was definitely Elevated that day. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great customer service!  You all have to try the Golden Beet it is so good and if you don't know what you want the staff gives great suggestions and they let you try the different juices based on what you want.  Atmosphere is quaint and very homey...Love It!  This is definately my new fave spot!  I'm going to start from the top of the menu and work my way down...I will let you all know how it goes."}
{"text":"I'm rarely on the far north side, but it's about time area residents get a juice bar of their own! Elevated Juice is convenient to the freeway, and handy for me to pop in before or after 5Ks or casual runs at Floyd Lamb Park. Chalk board menus, wood tables, and lots of natural light make this a welcoming spot.  Menu includes several juices ($8/ea) with specialty options and a trio of nut milks ($9/ea), coffees, and small food items like acai bowls and grab-and-go salads and sandwiches. The juice is obviously their focus though, and staff are really helpful about offering generous samples to help you make your selection.  So far, I've enjoyed the KiloBeet, Golden Beet, Mean Green, and Chia Milk, though the acai bowl was a little overblended (more like a smoothie bowl)- generous portion and lots of fresh fruit and nut toppings, though!"}
{"text":"Came here to have an acai bowl and wanted to try other things out. I walk in and it's very hipster, reclaimed wood on the walls and everywhere. There were 2 people in the place but looked like they already had their order, one guy behind the counter. I walk up, looking intensely at the menu, and the guy didn't greet me, nor offer any of help with the menu. A reviewer mentioned they had samples, but he didn't offer me any, even when I asked about what a popular juice flavor was since hubby was in the car and wanted something. Fine. I'll just order a smoothie, since that's safe, you never know if the ginger in the juice is overpowering. I ordered 1 smoothie, 1 acai bowl. Holy cow it took 15 minutes for 1 smoothie and 1 acai bowl to be made. I was the only one waiting for an order. Then just as I get my 1 smoothie and 1 acai bowl 15 minutes later, one of the guys in the restraint goes in the back, and the other guy talks about updating his website. Seriously you guys work here and couldn't help speed up the process? Too bad.... the acai bowl was delicious but way overpriced at $10 for a small bowl. I would have came back even though it's pricey if I didn't wait for 15 minutes for 1 smoothie and 1 acai bowl."}
{"text":"Great service and awesome acai bowls! Would recommended this place in the NW and I love all the way in the Southwest of town!"}
{"text":"So happy to know there is a juice bar in my area.  Ordered the island pitaya bowl and the sublime juice. I wasn't sure what kind of juice I wanted and they were kind enough to let me sample some different flavored. They also offer the 3 day cleans which I'm excited to try! I'll be back with my 2 younger kids."}
{"text":"Amazing and very comfortable new juice bar with rest drinks and vegan options for breakfast."}
{"text":"We went in there to get an acai bowl. Half the place was roped off because it was filthy in the back. There was a leak coming from the trash can and a bottle underneath the sign that had clearly been there awhile.   He didn't have any change for my husband who paid in cash and then it took 15 minutes to make the bowl. He went next door to another business to get change and then didn't even give the correct change.   When the bowl was done, he couldn't even find a spoon so that my husband could eat his food. We left as he was still searching for a spoon....   We will not be back."}
{"text":"Seriously happy to have a juice bar up in our neck of the woods. There is only so much fast food that you can take !  The staff here are very friendly and knowledgeable. The blends are excellent and I have been mixing them with my kombucha for some of the best tasting blends that I have had in a long time ( and without breaking out my juicer and making a huge mess every time )   Looking forward to trying all of the juices on the menu at some point !!"}
{"text":"Very very very friendly and helpful staff. The juices are delish! Good vibes here! Love it!"}
{"text":"Pink Dragon is my fav drink but I have had many that I Love. Fresh pressed juice for your health. Yum"}
{"text":"Uffff, I hate to do this, but I used to go to this place all of the time & I think twice now. The owners used to be there a lot & the quality went down between the revolving door of employees. They are always really, really nice, but I don't feel like there is a standard recipe for anything.  The inconsistency of the bowls & smoothies has just gone too far. You don't get all of the same toppings anymore, it used to have flax, walnuts, chia, now they never have nuts around. I'd pay extra, honestly. There used to be an older woman who worked there who seriously made the best bowls, they were crack. Bring her back! And both of the owners made amazing stuff, too.  They used to make their own cashew butter which I used to have in their chocolate smoothies all of the time, but no one even remembers. It was mindblowingly amazing - I couldn't make it at home, and I've tried!  They never have the chocolate nut mylk in stock.  It is so cute in here, and I see them trying to improve & expand their stuff. I'll come back & try again, because we love this place, but I miss your old stuff. *sob*"}
{"text":"I love Elevated Juice! It's my expensive addiction. My two favorite juices are kilobeet and mean green. I also love the avocado/date smoothie. The owners are very friendly and the produce they use are always fresh."}
{"text":"I am in love ...  I love their Pitaya bowls, I love their juices & smoothies! Every time I come here, I feel like a grown up with a kid's heart awakened - joyful & heartwarming. The owners & staff are very knowledgeable about what they create. They use quality produce. I love that they use dates & agave to satisfy my sweet tooth. They will help you meet your needs & may suggest a better alternative. I'm also looking forward for the soups that they will create in the fall.  Today, I'm having a Green Dream & you can always taste all the ingredients!"}
{"text":"Great little unknown juicery. The owner was nice and my smoothie is very good definitely coming back."}
{"text":"sampled multiple juices and smoothies .. literally think we ate a whole salad .. but it all taste amazing. After through maybe 4-5 samples, we got the yam cookie and tropical smoothie. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  We will be regulars !"}
{"text":"Smoothies are made to order and the fresh juices are cold pressed then bottled. I didn't order a salad but what they had available look very fresh as well. I'm definitely going back"}
{"text":"They were soooooo freaking good! EVERYTHING was fresh! Hands down my favoritist smoothie/juice place in life!! Pricey but worth every penny!!!"}
{"text":"I really like their juices, bowls, and smoothie options. They taste fresh and they are very flavorful. The prices are a bit higher than other similar places, but I understand and accept that fresh veggies and fruits are expensive in this economy and the time to make these items can be very labor intensive.  The big gripe I have is time it takes to get your order. I have been there maybe 6 times on different days of the week and varied times of the day and I just never know how service is going to be. Sometimes there is only one employee and that can get overwhelming since the bowls and smoothies are made fresh to order and that makes for a long wait time. So I would go with that mind frame and you won't be disappointed. The employees that I have encountered are friendly and very helpful with all of my questions about ingredients. They offer samples to taste and that is great before you buy."}
{"text":"I'm definitely going to miss the level & freshness of juices, bowls & other goodies they had to offer."}
{"text":"They let you sample juices and nut milks here. A lot of the flavors I tried were really good and fresh. I got the pink dragon nut milk and it was really good. My friend got a strawberry haze smoothie and was really disappointed. Their smoothies are icy and taste watered down.   I could've blended some ice and strawberry at home for a much cheaper price."}
{"text":"Their cashew milks are amazing! And I know amazing cashew milks! So creamy and perfectly sweet. You must try the Lavender and the Dragon Fruit one. Great smoothies. Great service, friendly staff, they all remember me now. The place looks trendy and comfy. They have Recycled Propaganda art on the walls, which adds to the healthy, modern feel of the place.  As far as food, I tried their pasta salad and it was very good, and I usually don't like pasta salads.  Really the only down side of this place is that they run out of cashew milks so fast!  Glad to have a \"go-to\" place so close to home for a healthy drink kick addiction."}
{"text":"Went into this place for the first time this morning. I am blown away by their amazing service. The young girl at the cash register is so sweet, friendly, and welcoming. There was also two other employees, a guy and a girl, who were amazing as well. I ordered an acai bowl and as I waited, they offered me samplings of their fresh pressed juices. It was so cute, they presented it like an official beer taste testing, lol!  The juices are so fresh, refreshing, and delicious. They sold me and I added one to my order as well. It seriously doesn't even taste like you're eating and drinking natural, healthy foods.  They also offered me samplings of their nut milks. Sooo yummy. One tastes like horchata! I didn't get one to go since I already bought a bowl and juice but I will certainly be back for one. Even my husband who hates anything healthy thought it was delicious, lol.   Just like any other natural juice and raw food restaurant/cafe/shop/store, it's not cheap but I would much rather give my business to them, being a smaller business, than to Jamba Juice and Whole Foods. They deserve it with their delicious foods and great service. The interior is so cute and nicely decorated as well! Love the place!  Plus side: they have a punch out card! No other place with raw juices that I have been to do that. I'm so happy to have these guys in my neighborhood. Customer for life!"}
{"text":"Really nice inside.  Very clean. There's tables and a juice bar you can sit at.   Got the Green Dream smoothie. Tastes good. No added junk in it they don't tell you about. The owner was there, could tell she worked hard at it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Why do I always have issues here?? Horrible, slow service but it's close to my house so I thought I'll give it another try. Now, the door is locked at 5 P.M. No sign, no one here!"}
{"text":"So first of all, when I walked in I felt like I walked into a little cabin because of their decoration--like woodsy, cute :) The girl that helped me let me try a couple of juices which were pretty good, but I wanted coffee :) The thing I'm most excited about is that they have nut milks AND PALEO PROTEIN BARS So I got my Americano with Almond milk and my paleo protein bar. Happy camper :) Next time I'm trying the juices for sure Definitely a good place for the health-conscious. :)"}
{"text":"Came over here after a job in the area and took the green dream smoothie and it's really good !  The service was fast and the price too,  I recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"I love Elevated Juice, I come here all the time! I've had a lot of the smoothies and juices but my favorite juice is the Refresh (if you like spicy) and the Notorious because it has sooo many veggies but tastes sweet and refreshing! My favorite smoothie is the PB & chocolate.. it's filling and is the perfect pick me up! If you're a peanut butter lover like me you will love this smoothie."}
{"text":"I was super excited when this opened so close to home. I went there so many(usually daily)times they knew my order before I walked in. Literally spent over a thousand dollars there.  Atleast 3x it said they open at 8, 815-830 sometimes as late as 930 I went back. Kept giving chances. Even told her that the customer driving away at 830 waited there with us then left, no apology, no hey this smoothie is on us  just they loved far away and someone else was supposed to open. Smoothies were good although they never tasted the same as the last. bought juice detox, they were good. Went back for two more and the price was over 40$ more for the two. He said oh she must have changed them. Went in 1x and said no smoothies till Friday because oven installfor a smoothie? Gave 1 last shot, husband went for my smoothie, they gave to him in a paper coffee cup no lid because they didn't have cups or lids. Never an apology so I'm done 7/22/17  Got a 5$ off email so on the wait out I figured maybe just maybe it would have improved. Well, I was wrong! 900 Saturday morning and they have NO bananas for smoothies, Albertsons is across the street. The smoothies that I did get are full of big ice chunks. Future trips I will go out of my way and just go to bowlology or pressed"}
{"text":"I've had a few of the pressed juices here and have been happy with the taste and quality of them all.    At $8 a piece, they are the typical price for juices and cheaper than you'll find around most stores downtown or on the strip. The location is convenient for those of us around the NW and the staff has been friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The past few months I've been here, I've been disappointed- for a while I would ALWAYS have these chopped up super hard things in my bowl and finally realized it was the date seed. The last couple times my bowl has had chunks of ice still in t and pretty watered down and flavorless."}
{"text":"So happy we found Elevated Juice.  We love to juice, but just don't have the time to juice as often as we'd like.  It's a great way to get the nutrition that you need and also keep your weight down.  The equipment that they use is excellent.. most juice bars will use a centrifugal juicer which is fine, but Elevated Juice uses a commercial version of the Norwalk Juicer which is the top of the line juicer.. it does the best job of getting the nutrients out of the vegetables.  We have one at home, but it's definitely a project every time we break it out.. much easier to go here for our juice.  Their nut-milk is also excellent and tasty.  The owners and staff are really nice and we always look forward to coming in to say hello."}
{"text":"Looking for healthy vegan meals & juices on Yelp and found this place! The service here is amazing. The sweet individual behind the register patiently explained different popular juice options, offered us samples, and described the ingredients in each juice as we sipped them. We bought a one day cleanse package (beginners) and even stayed for a couple of acai bowl. SO good!! I don't know how long you've been open on this side of town but we are so grateful! Can't wait to come back to try a smoothie or maybe a longer cleanse?"}
{"text":"I loved the fresh juices and ended up with a smoothie, with extra protein. The girl forgot the protein, but actually ran out to my car to fix my drink and ran back out. I appreciated that. I only wish I had a wider straw to drink the thick smoothie with. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by one day on a whim to pick up something for my sick nephew.  Very nice employee recommended \"Flow\" for his symptoms.  I took a couple bottles home to him and he was really happy with them.  Since nephew was so happy, I sent my Hubby back to pick up a few bottles for us.  He came home with a couple bottles of each \"Mean Green,\" \"Flow,\" and \"Refresh.\"  Love them all for different reasons!  So thrilled that we have such a great place up in the NW corner of town.  High quality, reasonable, and they have a frequent buyer program to boot!  Awesome!!  We'll be seeing you guys regularly!!"}
{"text":"Coming to this was a pretty terrible experience. I went in with my two friends and after they ordered, he asked if I was with them. I said yes, but was about to finish saying I was but I had a separate order of my own. Before I could do so, his back was already turned and he was starting on their Veggie hummus sandwiches and Two Strawberry haze smoothies. (he was alone, but we were the only ones in the store at this point) I figured he would probably begin them and come back... he finally came back to the counter after about 15 minutes, and gave the smoothies to me, and began asking me about their bread choices and if they wanted toasted bread and all the things you ask before you make someone a sandwich... I obliged and got him his answers. Then when he came back another time, he sees a woman who just came in and was behind me and nods to her asking what she wanted. She said she would come back because she worked next door and was on break.    FINALLY he takes my order....we have now been in the store for AT LEAST 30 minutes. I order an Acai island bowl. (my friends sandwiches of lettuce, tomato, and cucumber on wheat toast with hummus on it were STILL not fully assembled and their smoothies were runny and mediocre. Even worse still, they spent $30 on that meal! about 10 minutes later, the sandwiches finally make it out. Now there is a couple in the store gawking at the menu for at least 5 minutes before they asked him a few questions and exited the store. I see him walking back and fourth to a cooler for another 5 minutes before I go up to the counter to look and see if my bowl I paid $10 for was being assembled.     I was stunned when he then came to the counter and said, \"I'm about to start on it right now!\" I said that if he hadn't even started it yet to just put the money back on my card and I would just leave as I was extremely over it at that point. But of course, he couldn't work the register and didn't have the permissions to refund my money. Instead of being apologetic and understanding he was blank faced staring at me. He offered me a juice which was less than what I bought in the first place and he then said ok ill give you two juices. I said I didn't care which ones, took the juices and left. This could have been avoided and it's unfortunate that a good concept is mired with bad service."}
{"text":"I always get here about 15 minutes before closing. I cringe to the thought of feeling like an inconvenience when I know they are close to shutting their doors and here I am trying to order multiple smoothies.   Thing is they always make you feel welcomed, they don't rush you, and still take the time to make great consistent drinks.   The drinks are little pricier compared to your chain smoothie places, but it's definitely worth giving it a try.   Favorite smoothie: Very Berry  Also worth trying is the Aloha."}
{"text":"It's amazing how poor customer service can really tarnish a decent place. First the good, I got the Notorious juice on their recommendation and it was AMAZING!! And I have been to EVERY juice bar in Vegas and this was one of the best green juices I have ever had. Now the bad (sigh), when I first walked in there was nobody else there and I was ignored as I walked in. Ignored again as I stood at the counter while THREE girls including one who I believe was the owner were right in front of me messing with juices in the refrigerator, and then STILL ignored for ohhh a few more minutes till finally one of them decided to acknowledge me. I seriously felt like I was invisible and not to mention uncomfortable.They were out of the dragonfruit nut milk I wanted but the owner said she would be making some the following night. Needless to say I did not go back. I work in customer service and first impressions are the most important thing. You can always right a wrong with excellent customer service.I really hope this was just an off moment for them because again the juice was great. But the uncomfortable feeling while in the place was not. I'll try them again and hope the service is better."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and delicious drinks. The juices are $8. They offer many different types of juices, smoothies and salads. They also offer a juice cleanse that you can purchase there. I highly recommend stopping in and trying one of their delish juices. My drink choices are Elevate and Refresh. If you're in the mood for a sweet smoothie try the Apple Cookie!"}
{"text":"Just started my juicing adventure and I feel very lucky to have Elevated so close to my house! They are always so friendly and give me as many samples as I need. Also a wonderful price comparatively."}
{"text":"This little place is as hidden as Hunt & Gather Cafe(shameless plug) and an equally fabulous gem! It's earthy, healthy and family owned. Support our small business owners and feel healthy, it's a No brainer! I had the classic Acai Bowl and a homemade nut bar, good enough to skip my meal and delicious! High praise, definitely Elevated me!"}
{"text":"My daughter found this place online when my normal spot was having issues- I was greeted when I entered. Cute establishment- rustic, warm - went with a simple smoothie- banana, peanut butter and chocolate. Can't go wrong with that- so delicious, wasn't expecting to pay almost $9bucks, but I enjoyed the smoothie, which even had granola in it. This is not a normal go to- way out of budget - but a great treat now and then."}
{"text":"Juice an smoothies here are hit and miss. I have had some made spot on other times they are not the best. However it's close to my house so it's worth the gamble of flavor"}
{"text":"I've now been here twice. The first time the girls behind the counter were very quick to greet & kind. The second time, different girls, weren't necessarily rude but really didn't acknowledge me and checked me out very rapidly almost like they were frustrated they had to make a smoothie for me. Other than that, very yummy stuff. Always seems to be very clean and put together."}
{"text":"I found Elevated Juice here on Yelp looking for a cold pressed juicery in the NW area. I ordered a Pitaya bowl and Release juice (lemon, cayenne, agave, h20). They said they had just finished making the juice, so they gave an extra bottle for waiting a few minutes to bottle them. I'd never had a Pitaya bowl before, but I thought it was yummy! Not overly sweet, lots of fruit bits. Also, I stayed full for hours after, so it'd probably be best for breakfast. The juice is great as well. My mom and I are considering doing a cleanse eventually!"}
{"text":"I was so so so conflicted with what rating to give to this juice bar. Pros: 1) large variety of really delicious menu items 2) high quality organic produce is used 3) very friendly and helpful workers Cons: 1) VERY expensive in my opinion 2) pre-packaged juices seems questionable as opposed to freshly juicing them upon order 3) only one size to drinks. Although there was so much to like about this place, I just can't stand to spend so much on something I can get cheaper somewhere else that pretty much has the same quality."}
{"text":"I've really been getting into the juice and smoothie trend, so I thought I would give Elevated Juice a try. It had very good reviews so my standards were high. As soon I walked in, a blonde girl was laying on a chair with her shirt almost off and her bra showing in plain sight, and was getting a finger rub or something on her back from this guy in there. They were embarrassed when I walked in, and the guy kept his head down on the counter but she was quick to get up and kind enough to recommend some juices off the top of her head. The juice is pretty good though.  I only grabbed a bottle (Called Beyond) because I didn't want to be there any longer in the embarrassing vibe. The place was kinda messy due to remodeling. Not sure if I'll come back here for awhile."}
{"text":"Fantastic juice.  They strike a nice balance between the juice standard and Nektar.  Interesting and original juice combinations you won't find anywhere else in the city.    Their nut mylk is also amazing.    Their pitaya bowls are also amazing.    They are always genuinely friendly.  Nuff said, get some juice."}
{"text":"Arrived at 6:37 p.m. on a Sunday evening after checking hours on Yelp. Hours say 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Monday through Sunday but the place was shut up tight. No sign on the door saying hours had changed, nothing. Have the hours changed but web site and Yelp are not reflecting the change??  The one other time I went (in the morning) I tried an Acai bowl, which was delicious by the way."}
{"text":"Really great service, their juices also taste amazing! I was super impressed! I did a one day cleanse, and loved everything I tried. The girl that helped me did a great job of recommending juices and also let me try everything! My favorite so far has to be the dragonfruit nut milk! Really cute store."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bowl of acia. Was pretty disappointed.   There was a large group in front of me, which the guy helping me told me. They only had two of them working. Totatlly understandable. And the guy was super nice and apologetic.   But a young lady walked in about 5 minutes after me and ordered. And for some reason, her order was rushed and she walked out before I did. I waited 15 minutes, almost 20 for my bowl.   The bowl itself was good. Not the best acia bowl I've had. It was super sweet. I'm sure it was the fruit that was just extra sweet that day. KEEP IN MIND: if you're looking for something healthy, these bowls or smoothies still have a shit ton of sugar. Granola usually has the most amount of sugar. So I always ask for my bowls without the granola.  Most bowls have anywhere from 40-65g of sugar. You only need roughly 25g of sugar per day.   When I finally got my bowl--half of the of the bowl had honey all over it. I got into my car, and it was a complete mess. I had honey all over my hands, steering wheel and my consol. That was super fun to clean up.    Another thing is--their prices. These healthy places really jack up their cost. A small acia bowl here, with tip, was almost $13. That's insane to me. I know organic  is more expensive. I only buy organic fruits and veggies. And I make smoothies at home on the daily. So they're marking up these prices big time. It's a nice treat here and there. But if you're buying for more than one, that's a whole lot of monies to me for a small portion.   It's a cool little joint, but not cool enough for me to want to venture into again."}
{"text":"I was here twice in 2 days and had two completely different experiences. My final star review is a combination of both experiences.   First time (Sunday at 9:30am): Why haven't I come here sooner? This is a hidden gem! Yes the prices may seem high to some  but totally justified with the kinds of high quality ingredients they use. This will definitely my new go to place when I want to treat myself. Today I got an apple pie smoothie and it literally was the best smoothie I have ever had! All healthy ingredients too! Star rating: 5  Second time (Monday at 8am): Came back here today and literally was one of the worst customer service experiences. The lady behind the counter ignored us for 10 minutes even though we were the only people in the store. Then she took our order but when another customer came in she told us that he ordered first so we needed to wait until he was done. She just seemed so frazzled and was moving so slow that we decided to leave. She didn't even offer an explanation or apology. I can understand if you are busy or something happened but just let us know. We literally live 2 minutes away and if we had a positive experience we would be here every morning getting 2 drinks instead of going to Starbucks (ugh). I want to try this place again because of the great experience I had over the weekend. I hope today was a fluke but it really makes me hesitant to come back. I'm afraid of what experience I'm going to get. Star rating: 0"}
{"text":"Delicious smoothies and juices. Real food. And exceptional customer service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Like others, I've been waiting to try this place out for months! Just kept checking back on their Instagram to see if they had open. It was worth the wait. Everyone there is very knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful with assisting you in finding the perfect juice or smoothie for yourself. My boyfriend and I tried a few things (they love letting you sample the juices and milks) and I ended up with Yam Cookie Nut milk and my boyfriend ended up with a vanilla nut milk. SO tasty. I love that they don't use sugar as a sweetener. Will be back very soon to pick up juice and more milk."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite place in Las Vegas to grab a smoothie!  The flavors are all unique and the drinks are consistently well crafted with tasty ingredients."}
{"text":"When it comes to juices and smoothies Elevated Juice has many healthy options. Nicole was very informative and helpful in choosing what to order. Will definitely be coming again to do a healthy cleanse that they offer."}
{"text":"This place is meh and slightly overrated.   This area has been long overdue for a juice stand but this place hardly measures up.  I've found that despite a lengthy menu, they seem to only keep a couple of blends on hand.   This theory has held up over the last 3-4 times I visited.  Also, after visiting  2 other juice stands (a little further out) I've realized that that they are terribly overpriced for what you get.   I think the concept is great but the execution puts this place on par with a mini fridge that stores a couple of juice blends with a 30% markup."}
{"text":"Beyond happy about Elevated Juice! The owner, Christina was so friendly and even let me sample ALL the juices and nut milks!! Every single one was great! I had a hard time choosing which ones I wanted for my cleansing pack (4 juices & 1 nut milk). And their smoothies are awesome! My daughter (10y) got the Apple Pie smoothie, loved it, and now we have a healthy place to go for after school snacks! She even liked the juices!! LOVE IT HERE!"}
{"text":"So excited to have an exceptional juice bar in the NW! The owner was very courteous, knowledgable, and generous with allowing us to sample some of their juices. It was great to hear that he \"lives by his beliefs\" and has lost 75 lbs. from juicing several times/day. I love that they juice, smooth, and coffee, because sometimes spicing up (or \"elevating\") your life comes in different forms ;-). As I am a CSCS fitness coach, I am very familiar with juicing, it's nutritional benefits, and how important it is for your body to be given the nutrients it needs to, not just to maintain a proper metabolism, but to prevent disease, and to promote longevity/quality of life. As I tell all my members, living incredibly well isn't given; you have to take initiative, DO WORK, and make it happen for yourself. So in a nutshell, go try these guys."}
{"text":"My experiences: -Walking in with one person ordering one thing in front of you and then waiting so long after you order that when you go Back up to the register to check in on your order, the employee asks, \"hello, what would you like today?\"  and you have to explain that you Already ordered... - have received the wrong drink before.  - came in and asked what a matcha latte was and I was told \"I believe it's a chocolate drink.\"   I recommend saving your money."}
{"text":"Wow. I was yelping to find a juice spot while on the highway and I passed this place by about ten minutes. I almost didn't turn around and I am so glad I did. This may be the best juice spot I've ever been to, it's legit. They have acai bowls, amazing. They have the best juices I've ever had, concocted to perfection. They have different nut milks....something I've not tried and they are spectacular! I came for a smoothie and ended up not even trying one. I got the bowl and a juice which were absolutely delightful. I will come here every time I'm in Vegas. If you are a juice lover or even thinking about this route, do not miss this place. If you love this place, tell me, I'll come hit you in the head with a beet. Cheers elevation, you f'ing rock!"}
{"text":"I love the green juices and green smoothies. I drink a juice a day. Really helps my energy level and all over well being. The just added a cold brew coffee maker!! My favorite place!!"}
