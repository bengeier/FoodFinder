{"text":"AMAZING!!!!! Best I have had in many many years. One dish is even better than the last. We have been going to a restaurant on  Mott St. In NY for many years, when we lived  in the area and when we go back. Lam's is at least as good maybe better. Five Stars sells it short. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"omg! I have lived in Union County for over 11 years. I haven't had Chinese Food THIS GOOD since I've been in the area!!!  Fresh! Appealing to the eyes! Smelled wonderful! From the first bite to the last, I enjoyed EVERY MOMENT! I didn't want it to end! My taste buds have been BLESSED! I ate so much...the 'Itis is kicking in!   I only had the Malaysian Style Curry Chicken and the Shrimp Fried Rice. However, I will DEFINITELY be back for more and plan on trying all of my usual favorite Chinese dishes and some new ones!  ABSOFRIGGINLUTELY DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"Good to find this restaurant provides original and nice chinese food in south part of Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Excellent chinese food and delicious dishes! We tried the General Tao chicken entree and the steamed dumplings and crab rangoon appetizers. The dumplings were hot and savory with delicious sauces. The crab rangoon were crispy and tasty! I enjoyed the wonderful food. They don't have delivery so we had takeout. They were fast on a weeknight about 20 minutes. They are in a plaza near Harris Teeter off Potter rd."}
{"text":"All four dishes (crispy tofu, soft shell crab, eggplants clay pot, and seafood Mei Fun) that we ordered are all delicious! The tofu and soft shell crab are crispy and perfectly seasoned. The eggplants with salted fish is very nice and the wide noodles with seafood is cooked perfectly. It's surely nice to have another authentic Chinese restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Probably the most authentic Asian restaurant I've been too and it's so delish! I always get the curry noodle soup and the portions are nicely sized so I can have left overs for work the next day! It is totally worth the drive if you want something yummy!"}
{"text":"Food is always good. Small restaurant, be prepared to wait for a table during peak hours. But definitely worth it!! Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and was pleasantly surprised!  We kept it simple as we had not ordered from here before.    The Spring Rolls were very fresh and tasty.  The sesame chicken was quality chicken breast, my son said its the best he's had here, and not so greasy.  The Singapore noodles also very fresh, tasty and not greasy. We will return and order more variety now that we've had a very good first experience."}
{"text":"Don't let the paper and note menus fool you.  The food is delicious and authentic.  Szechuan cold appetizer and wontons are a great start...warning, mild is quite spicy.  Try off the special note menu- steam sea bass was cooked to perfection with ginger and scallion, fresh vegetables - baby gai lan and snow pea leaves all perfectly saut√©ed.   The hot pot of diced chicken, salty fish and either eggplant or tofu is plentiful of chicken and good bits of salty fish.     They just opened 2 months ago,  replacing a another favorite place.    It has taken us some time to find very good Chinese food since moving to Charlotte and this place is the real deal.   Small place and seats only ~ 24 people.     Small business and hope they succeed, definitely worth a try-  we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Just moved to area & this Chinese restaurant a terrific surprise! Very fresh & authentic...we had Szechuan wonton app they make fresh w/melt in your mouth dough & delicious sauce :) then tried Beef  w/Lan peppers which really enjoyed. I don't care for spicy so I had prawns w/broccoli which waitress suggesting adding mixed veggies too & it was very fresh & flavorful. They take 1 day to make side chili sauce which my husband mixed w:his entree & loved. Highly recommend this hidden gem :)"}
{"text":"Food was over cooked and far too salty. Service was rushed and very slow. Drive to Park Rd or Fort Mill for better service & much better food."}
{"text":"YUMMOOOO!!! I don't even wanna say much more because I had to order ToGo && KNOW I'LL BE BACK TO POST AN AMAZING REVIEW! I had pan fried dumplings & Singapore rice noodles w/ no chicken... WONDERFUL!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best authentic Chinese food I've had anywhere in this area! The seafood pan fried noodles and salt and pepper pork chops were probably my favorite dish. I can't wait to try all the others. Only drawback of this place is it is a small restaurant, with only about 8 or 9 table's. It's not really close to any major roads either, but totally worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Amazing Szechuan cuisine! All the dishes we had were so flavorful and delicious. The service for a small restaurant was very good. Don't ask for Duck sauce and Mustard because they don't have it.  This is traditional Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"The food is SUPERB!! I had the Golden Prawns & they were seasonred to perfection.  They were so good my 6 yr old tried it & ate most of them. He hardly eats anything, but he loves the prawns. Can't wait to get the lobster next!."}
{"text":"I'm come from Hong Kong. Lam's Kitchen is really good, I like all the dish . They are transitional Chinese favor. Many choices from menu. The price are reasonable too! High recommend! Best in town!"}
{"text":"Finally authentic Chinese comes to Indian Trail. Staffed by friendly smiling faces who patiently indulged my curiosity I got a good feeling. I cannot say with any degree of practical knowledge if this fare is considered great/ good or poor, but on this night the place was filled with an ethnic group clearly familiar with the food and my palate was happy. The average American used to \"Americanized Chinese\" will not likely recognize many of the offerings but fear not and forage ahead, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  We took home Maylasian style chicken curry and Roasted Duck Noodle soup and both were delicious and not at all the oily and greasy concoctions so often offered by other shops.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food with great flavors. Will definitely try the entire menu. Small cozy space, not too many seats, but the food will liven your tastebuds. So why the dropped star. Value proposition is a bit lacking. They charge similar prices to Lee Cafe or Chuan Wang Fu, but you get half the portion size. If they work on giving you a bit more bang for your buck, I'd give them 5 stars. But with the limited seating, and smaller turn over ability, I can understand why they squeeze every dish, since they can only serve up so many each day.  Also, hard pass on their \"lobster\" dishes. You don't even get a full lobster tail for the price they charge you.  Give it a try, definitely a different offering than your other two Szechuan \"Charlotte\" offerings."}
{"text":"Nice staff good food. a local favorite. Went in here last friday and was taken care of immediately. Great service."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese in the area. Hands down. Dumplings, special house fried rice, sesame beef and chicken all fantastic. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The most authentic Chinese food I have had in North Carolina.   The spicy Szechuan dumplings were so fresh and so good I devoured them before I could take a photo.  Here's the other perfect menu items i tried:  The ma-po tofu was classic with little bits of pork,  The Yu-Xiang pork was fresh, slightly sweet and slightly vinegary.  The fresh pea shoots were green and tender.  They even had nice outside seating that worked great of a warm mosh spring day.  The staff are friendly and helpful. What a joy!"}
{"text":"I really was hoping this was a great Chinese Restaurant, I just could not get that out of this meal. We had ordered a lot of different typical Chinese dishes. The best item was our first which was the Chinese Dumplings or Pot Stickers, which were just steamed but filled with a very good pork and cabbage mixture. There was a few of us so we had a couple of different dishes. We had the Beef Chow Fun, with the big flat noodles, Not tasty and not good. We ordered the Beef and Broccoli, which had a lot more flavor that the Beef Chow fun but nothing out of the ordinary. We also had General Tso's Chicken which had some flavor but was fried way to crisp to chew. My favorite dish to try everywhere is the Singapore Rice Noodles, usually with a great Curry flavored sauce and chicken, shrimp and tofu. This came with some okay Chicken, Very dry noodles, no Curry taste at all. The shrimp were scarce and the tofu rubbery. I did not like it at all. I went because people have reviewed it and said it was great and authentic, I will give it another chance but this was not a good first impression."}
{"text":"First and only good - actually really good - Chinese we've had in Charlotte in 8 years. Pea tips, hot pot, mei/chow fun and all the Americanized stuff is excellent. Had out of sight beef with hot peppers - new to me. Headed back -25 mile drive tomorrow. Go try it!!!"}
{"text":"It's nice to find a place the make authentic Chinese food. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was great! We started with the Szechuan wontons. A nice mix of pork and shrimp in a spicy sauce. For lunch we ordered the clay pot of seafood, salt and spice pork chop and the string beans with XO sauce.  Everything was delicious. Lots of leftovers. We will definitely be going back to eat our way through the menu. The best Chinese food I have had in the 12 years I've been living in NC."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I've had in North Carolina. This is a small but incredibly popular restaurant and for god reason, the food is delicious. Expect to have to wait for a table and expect to have the food take awhile but in the end, it will be worth it. The only negative is, they don't serve beer or wine but, there's a grocery store literally right next to the place where you can purchase your favorite beer/wine and bring it next door to drink while you feast."}
{"text":"Authentic Cantonese food finally!!!! If you go in wanting the usual Panda Express stuff you will be missing out (but I think they do those stuff pretty well too - I haven't tried any sesame chicken etc etc so I don't know) but the \"real\" dishes are top notch - the roast duck, bbq roast pork (I think this could be good entry-level dish if you haven't had authentic Chinese ever this is NOT normal western BBQ though)  if you had calamari somewhere else you have to try the salt and pepper squid (deep fried it's excellent) beef chow fun (beef with thick noodles cooked dry) is perfect with the char-taste from a hot wok and no ubiquitous brown sauce in sight. Great authentic dishes we love- pork belly with preserved vegetable, chicken-eggplant and salty fish clay pot (so good with white rice), pigs ear with chili sauce and the tripe with 5 spice - both comes chilled and excellent. I have been eyeing the fish and need to order a fish dish next time... they have a special list in Chinese - the waitresses will gladly translate - it usually contains fresh-seasonal vegetables, fresh seafood, and seasonal specialties like sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf....  it's such a treat to have them around!!!"}
{"text":"heard so much about this restaurant so my friends and I drove 2hrs to give it a try. Def. worth the drive. Love all the dishes especially the golden shrimp. Will def. come back?"}
{"text":"Lam's kitchen has really great, authentic Chinese food - the best I've had since I moved to Charlotte.  I started with a wonton soup. The wontons had both pork and shrimp and were delicious.  Then I had the steak chinese style, salt and pepper squid and pork chops. Everything was great and I can't wait to come back and try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"Authentic and reasonably priced! Serendipitously found this place for lunch one weekend and it did not disappoint. You can ask for a daily specials menu (available in Chinese only)."}
{"text":"Best authentic chinese food in Charlotte! The chef is very nice, I have tried several dishes and they was just perfect. My friends also enjoyed their food, they provided cantonese flavor and szechuan flavor, so you could enjoy different food in here."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for a to-go order on my first visit to this restaurant and was pleasantly surprised with the high quality of the food.  , I had fried rice with mushroom soup and spring rolls. The spring rolls it did seem a bit greasy  but they were delicious. I would certainly recommend you give this place a try if you're seeking authentic Chinese food.  The food is certainly reasonably priced. And myself being a bit temporarily handicapped the staff help carry my meal out to the car for me what wonderful people."}
{"text":"I drove to this location to go to YUME Bistro for some ramen but was surprised it's now Lam's.  We gave it a try and were not disappointed. This place served very authentic Chinese dishes. I had fried shrimp balls for appetizer and stir fried squid. Both were delicious. My daughter had roasted duck noodle soup that she said was the best roasted duck she had in a long time.  The menu was in English and Chinese so definitely a good sign."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in North Carolina. From California and I can honestly say it better than anything I even had there."}
{"text":"Nothing is more satisfying than finding an amazing place you'd want to bring your friends to! Hands down one of my favorite places for \"food that hits the spot!\" Talk about authentic Chinese comfort food. Found this hidden gem in Matthews, NC and it's our newest spot for delicious, fast, authentic Chinese food. My family of 6 dined in this compact sized restaurant on a late weekday evening and we were greeted and seated immediately. The menu and atmosphere is family friendly with high chairs available. Our food came out promptly and you can tell it was fresh out of the kitchen. Everything we ordered was beyond delicious! The portions are huge so we had lots of left overs for another family meal. Definitely on my hubby and my \"A\" list of places to eat around Charlotte! Go check them out and see for yourself. Here's what we ordered: 1. Crab Rangoon $5 for 6 2. Crispy Fried Shrimp Ball $8 for 4 (kids fave) 3. Beef brisket Noodle Soup $10 (hubby's fave) 4. Black Pepper Steak $16 (hubby's fave) 5. Chinese Style Fried Rice $12 (kids fave) 6. Salt and Spice Pork Chop $15 7. Eggplant in garlic sauce $12 8. Soft Shell Crab Hong Kong Style $16 (my fave) 9. Honey Roasted Pork $12  10. Steamed Lobster with Sticky Rice $45 (my fave)"}
{"text":"If you want authentic Chinese food this is the place. There are plenty of American Chinese food places but this is a great option.The space is small so I recommend calling and picking up is you want to eat in the evening. It's fine during lunch."}
{"text":"Hmm, I'm writing this a while after eating here but what remember is that the food was tasty...maybe too tasty salt wise. Serving size were good portions. Only major drawback is too lil seating. But, why is it that lil restaurants w/lil seating are always line intense w/customers waiting? Just like in Hawaii! But, in Hawaii, it means the food is super ono enuf for u to suffer the wait."}
