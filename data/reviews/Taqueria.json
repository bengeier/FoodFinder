{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall worthy of our 30 min drive there! Best Mexican food I tasted so far! Fresh ingredients super flavorful.  The shripadilla is an explosion of flavors in your mouth its pretty amazingly tasty!!! Tacos are excellent! Great music , service and the lady that cooks is the bomb!!! She is super friendly and will do whatever you want ! I can't say enough about this place! We will be regulars!! My kids love the homemade horchata and ending our meal with tres leches, flan or sopapillas!! YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't have a lot to say other than the best tacos I've ever had! Nice quiet place, great service!"}
{"text":"Food was AWESOME!!! Went here to grab lunch, and was pleasantly impressed. 100% authentic! The staff is courteous and professional. I had chorizo and Campechano (Steak & sausage) tacos. The salsa was good too! Just the right amount of spicy. My only negative is that the menu is kind of pricey, and chips and salsa does not automatically come with your order. The sides in particular are quite pricey, for example: a side of cheese is $1.00....if you want to include sour cream ect....expect a hefty bill. Other than that...the place is a authentic gem, and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Taqueria  at 8652 Pineville Matthews Rd. was a chance find that I truly enjoyed this afternoon!!  I just wanted something light and totally enjoyed 2 chicken tacos.  They were well seasoned with fresh cilantro, radish and lime.  I'll surely return soon to try dinner!!"}
{"text":"A traditional place with delicious tacos!   The owners are very friendly and lovely people.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went in based on great yelp reviews. We tried two chicken tacos and the California Burrito with steak. Chicken was cold and dry. Way too much DRY not fresh cilantro was put on the tacos. The burrito was bland and had little flavor.  We were overcharged for the burrito also.  Coffee was instant coffee with granules on the bottom of the cup."}
{"text":"Family owned authentic Mexican food. Best burrito I have had in Charlotte. The drink specials may be cheaper than anywhere around. Really nice people, good service and fresh food."}
{"text":"Positive reviews on this place are flat out lies. We went in there was nobody there, our food took forever, the restaurant itself is very low end. I don't judge by appearances, but the food was absolutely horrible. Prices are on par with good Mexican restaurants Unedible. It was like a private version of Kitchen Nightmares. Never ever ever doing that again. Enter at your own risk."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the chicken and steak chimichangas respectively. We both really enjoyed our meals. They come cooked with crispy shell and delicious cheese sauce on top. The service was attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is casual/not fancy. There were others eating there that were obviously regulars (which is a good sign). If we get the opportunity, we definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but nope. Just nope. The basket of chips that they give you is about a third of the size of normal Mexican restaurants & they are super slow with refills. I ordered the cheese dip & I'm pretty sure it was the white Velveeta dip. It was so thick our chips would break when dipping them & had no flavor at all. The tacos were okay, but I've better from food trucks if that says anything ... Won't be back."}
{"text":"We love this little spot!!!! Like the other reviewer said, don't let the lack of flash stop you. The food is fresh! The tacos are amazing! The staff is friendly and helpful. I have been here several times over the last two months. I love it!"}
{"text":"Crap-tastic food and service. It's a literal \"hole in the wall\" restaurant. I had an extremely poor experience at this place and would not recommend at all"}
{"text":"Place is good and authentic. Service was good. Different variants on tacos than a traditional American Mexican restaurant. Meats were a tad dry. The  price point is a little high for what you get in my opinion, everything seems to be an extra charge.   For a similar option with better pricing (kids eat free on Sunday) and atmosphere I would try Zapata's in Ballantyne. If you go there and don't enjoy your meal you are probably ordering the wrong thing."}
{"text":"Did not live up to the hype. Tried chicken, beef, and carne. All of them lacked flavor. The horchata was good."}
{"text":"I work in the area and I'm always looking for a solid tex-mex and this place has it.    I tried the chicken burrito; the chicken was tasty and the ingredients were fresh.  The burrito itself was a substantial size and a great value when compared to the other similar restaurants.  The one thing that separates this restaurant from others was the fresh ingredients.  I would definitely visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Just moved from Texas and this is the best Mexican food I've had since I got here. A lot of places around here don't know what good quality Mexican food is and I've tried many places since living here and it's been a disappointment. Love the ingredients and freshness to all the dishes I've tried. Love it!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal at this authentic taqueria! We are from CA, and so we know good Mexican food. The food was delicious, and the staff and owners were very friendly and attentive; they even gave us an amazingly delicious complementary dessert after talking with us about their business for several minutes. There is something for everyone at their restaurant--even for those in your party who do not want to eat traditional Mexican cuisine, i.e. salads and hamburgers. Now, their food isn't Americanized or tex-mex (which is a great thing) so don't expect that and if you've never had authentic Mexican food, keep an open mind--you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Food very bland ordered the tacos Chicken was very bland cold and rubbery texture Cilantro was dried out and was not fresh at all and way way to much was put on food"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for authentic tacos in town.  The people working are always super friendly and the place is always very clean.  The food is consistently good, I've had their tacos, enchiladas and the mole de pollo, not only are the tacos excellent but the the mole is top notch."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch today, and it was so good!  I got 3 chicken tacos, and they were all simple amazing.  Everything was so fresh, and not too greasy or heavy like some tacos.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The kind of place these two foodies love to find - authentic and locally owned. I thoroughly enjoyed the Enchiladas Rojas and my partner loved both his Barbacoa and Carnitas taco plate.  He also really loved the mole!  I look forward to returning to indulge in shrimp tacos.  A super plus for me is the wide choice of gluten free.  Maria and her family are doing a wonderful job in this small, casual but warm little restaurant with very reasonable prices.  She greeted us warmly as we came in, and was great about discussing the menu. You will be happy when you enter and satisfied when you leave!"}
{"text":"This place has good shrimp tacos! Their salsa is pretty good and spicy.  Maria gives great customer service. If you're new to the restaurant, she'll go over the menu and explain everything.   I had the beef gordita and sope. Both were good, but the shrimp taco was my favoite.   I'm used to the SoCal Mexican food and its hard to find authentic mexican food and Charlotte. This one is one of the better Mexican restaurants i've had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Went to this place yesterday for dinner....    When I arrived the place was practically empty.  I thought uh-oh....  However, I have to admit that the food was pretty good and at a great price.  First, I got the complimentary bowl of chips and dipping sauces.  The chips were still a little warm and crispy which I thought proved they were fresh.  Then, I ordered three small tacos.  One of carnitas, another of carne asada and one al pastor.  All three meats were flavorful and delicious.  The tortillas were very soft and fresh.  Honestly, the tortillas were some of the best I've had.  I added a pepsi to top it all off.  The bill was $8 and change....... Can't beat that."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and took a chance & I now love this place to go for authentic Mexican food!  It's a great little family business. They have beef tongue tacos and homemade horchata that I haven't found in other Mexican restaurants!! The chorizo tacos were wonderful, too. The guacamole is fresh made to order. The server was friendly, helpful, and fast. Mixed drinks, wine, and beer are available. We met the owner Maria and her son Eric who were super nice. We will return to try more items on the menu...including the desserts."}
{"text":"I think  they have  the best tacos  in Charlotte freshly  made to Peter's excellent selection of fillings"}
{"text":"It might look small but it is big on flavor!  Friendly servers and great margaritas make this a perfect spot to grab a quick lunch or enjoy a sumptuous evening meal! I cannot express in words how grateful I am to have found superb Latin cuisine so far from Los Angeles.  Good prices, great service, & fabulous food make this new joint a place you will return to again and again."}
{"text":"I ordered three tacos of the owner's choice: beef/pork combo, steak and chorizo. The tacos were simple, not overly garnished and the flavors distinct. They were all delicious and under six bucks.  I ended up eating a fourth fish taco that was my personal favorite. It came with a very light lime mayo sauce that set off the well cooked fish perfectly.  Chips were average, but the salsa was well spiced and flavorful.  We started off the only patrons and were immediately seated by the owner. He was very friendly and helpful, explained the menu and a little about the way they do things. He was more than happy to pick my food for me and made great choices. We also recieved our food almost immediately. Couldn't recommend any more highly."}
{"text":"If anyone is looking for the tastiest tacos in the city, you have to stop Taqueria burrito bar and tacos at 687 Yonge Street in Toronto. Hands down the best tacos and burritos you're going to get in the city. The food is always fresh and the homemade hot sauces make each bite into your tacos taste like heaven. My personal favourite are the shrimp tacos in the hard taco shells. Make sure you add an order of chips and salsa too, it completes the perfect meal.   I'll definitely be back to this place.   Cheers Chang"}
{"text":"Slow service, bland food, and overpriced drinks. Even using a Groupon, I won't be back."}
{"text":"The salsa was almost tasteless whichvis stunning for a Mexican restaurant.  Once the main course arrived we still wanted to give this place a chance to impress. A simple taco and burrito still was not flavorful. Whether you're looking for authenticity or flavor this is not the place."}
{"text":"Nice, nice service.  Quiet place.  Service, though, was slow.  Food about a 3.5 out of 5.  Must eat their char (?) desserts, though, preferably caramel."}
{"text":"This is my kind of place. It's located in what's nearly a \"hole in the wall\" in a strip mall next to a buffet restaurant.  This is a 'taqueria' by the most pure definition of the word. This is street food in a restaurant. I've ordered all the traditional tacos, and they are all delicious. The tortillas are perfectly cooked, the portion size is spot-on, and the radish, along with the toppings for each taco are fantastic. I could eat a dozen of these at a sitting, but I try to stop at 3.  I've also tried the refried beans and the rice, both of which taste amazing. The beans are creamy and mild, and the rice is savory, but not over-salted.  This place is authentic, and the owner is very friendly and engaging. I only drop one star for a few reasons: I wish that the chips and salsa weren't charged after the first basket (it's a low priced/loss lead food item, so not sure why they charge for extra), I also wish the wait staff was a bit older/more seasoned. Finally, I wish there were some milder salsas. I love Mexican street food, but this gringa in Charlotte can't take the heat! Their green salsa is the mildest heat-wise. I'd like more flavor and a bit less heat as an option.  Still, 4 stars from me, and I recommend this place highly. I'm developing a craving again, just reviewing it! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped by taqueria burritos and tacos this afternoon for lunch. Ordered 3 dishes and shared it with a friend. Ordered the halibut soft tacos, barbacoa crispy tacos and corn fritter soft tacos.  They were all really yummy, but my favorite of the 3 was the halibut. My friend really liked the corn fritters.  I really liked the fact that the guac is included with all the dishes.  I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Still on the search for Tripa and tongue taco perfection and decided to give this place a try.  I sauntered into here with my daughter on our weekly date and we found that we had the place to ourselves. The waiter was very efficient and may have checked on us, a tad too much but I think too much is better than not enough.  She ordered steak, I ordered, tripa, cabeza and lengua tacos with a side of hot sauce and we got complimentary chips and salsa.  They definitely didn't give you enough salsa for the amount of chips so you may have to ask for a bit more.   Now on to the tacos. Well, they were just okay.  Not the best, wouldn't travel far to get them.  The tripa tasted, well....muddy and the others just weren't bursting with flavor.  I asked for hot sauce and of the two presented, neither was really spicy.  They were generous on the meat, cilantro and onion and love the chips and salsa freebie but it was just okay in my eyes.  I'm still searching for that amazing taco experience with really spicy salsa and a place that serves the pickled peppers, carrots and onion mixture on the side.  Maybe this was just a Maryland thing and is not common here and I hate to keep making comparisons because I see all of these other rave reviews but I have to be honest for what I have had and the standard I hold all tacos to.  I will say that I will give it another try because sometimes there are off days at businesses and reading the other reviews, I'm thinking I might be missing something.  When I do, I will update my review. That is all!"}
{"text":"Food was EXCELLENT so fresh and yummy. Margaritas were the best I have had in a very long time.. Must come try!"}
{"text":"Complete shame, but I see it all the time - Great food and poor service. On top of that, there was an odd gas-like odor (boo-boo). However, the food is consistently tasty. Second week in a row dining here, but we will not be going back due to the unacceptable service; 2 tables walked out while we were there."}
{"text":"If you quiero tacos around the Yonge and Bloor area, stop in at the Taqueria!  I have to say, I don't miss the Spring Rolls Express that used to be at this location at all!    The space is newly renovated with faux wood and cork board.  It's bright and comfortable with lots and lots of seating.  The specials are scrawled on a chalkboard with the catch of the day.  There are old school tunes playing in the background.  It's like a takeout version of a fancy taco eatery without the hype and line up.  They had a lot of options! Chicken, steak, carnitas, barbacoa, fish, shrimp, and vegetarian. And served up as a taco, burrito, taco bowl, salad, or nacho platter... whatever your Mexican fast-food craving desires.  I thought about getting tacos, but I was starving. I ordered a burrito and as usual, I was very particular about the toppings. They were friendly and told me it was fresh to order (no eye rolling or anything!)  I ordered the halibut with sauteed veggies, lettuce, and guacamole for a bit more.  Then I asked for a whole wheat tortilla, no rice, no beans, no sauce, and no sour cream, but cheese is okay ($11).  I liked that they have corn salsa. Corn salsa is underrated.  I glanced around and the nacho platters looked freaking delicious. The soft tacos were popular as well. An order of tacos is $9 and you get three of them.  I took my burrito home and it was just the way I asked. The fish was moist and lightly battered and fried. Lots of veggies. Everything was fresh and very enjoyable. I'll be back, maybe to try some soft tacos!"}
{"text":"This place serves traditional Mexican street food and it is freaking fantastic!  We had fish, steak, chorizo,  and barbacoa tacos and all were super fresh and delicious. Tacos are only about $2 each! It's great to have this place in our area, it's a nice break from the slew of Americanized Mexican restaurants. The owners are very nice, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went here for a date night on Friday night, and we were the first ones there that evening.  Some more came in after us, but it was never busy.  Bad for them but I liked it because it was quiet and quaint!  They bring you chips and salsa to start, which has a but of a kick to it, but still good flavor!  I ordered the chicken chimichanga and my husband got two tacos, pork and bbq beef.  Everything had excellent flavor, we both loved our meals!!  They had two servers working, both would check in on us, which could get annoying, but I understand they just want to make sure everyone had everything they need or want.  It just can be a bit much.  We both would give this 4 stars, can't say anything that we disliked here, just like to save the 5 for the best!  We will be back."}
{"text":"One of the best for tacos in Charlotte. We tried the fish, shrimp, barbacoa and beef tongue  tacos; all delicious!  And the homemade Horchata is fantastic! I'll be visiting once a week."}
{"text":"Great tacos! Non-assuming place. The real thing."}
{"text":"I have gone here 4 times in the last two weeks should be as good a review as anyone needs.    I have had a few of the burritos and they are extremely good and filling.  All the toppings are included, no extra paying for guacamole which some places try.   The crispy tacos are good but not up to the quality of the burritos.  To top it off the service is really great.  Tonight they gave me the wrong order (added beans) and they quickly made me another and even through in free chips and guac.  What a deal!    Definitely added to my lunch/quick dinner rotation."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak, chicken, & fried pork soft tacos (one of each), & a chicken quesadilla with fries. The tacos were tiny. They had the meat, cilantro, one piece of lime for all 3 tacos, & sliced radishes. Meh meh MEH! Out of all of that, the only thing that had any flavor was the fried pork taco. If a Mexican cooks a Mexican dish then yes I would consider it authentic. However, that doesn't necessarily mean it automatically tastes good. I've had better at a taco fresco."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great find. Really out of the way. Even a local didn't know about it. The best fish taco I've ever had. Taco salad was huge and had great flavors. The chicken quesadilla was really good. Food cooked with love. Go here! The staff was really friendly! Thanks for a great meal and experience."}
{"text":"Best (Taqueria) Taco Place in South Charlotte.  If I can give this place more then 5 stars I would definitely!   I came in for lunch, from the second I walked in I was greeted with a nice smile and an option to sit anywhere.   There was really only a few people in the place but I don't understand why.  I looked over and the sanitary score is above 96 which is pretty good in my books.    So my server took her time and went through the entire menu, I didn't expect that but thank you!  She was super sweet, told me the favorites and didn't rush.  So I give her a high 5 on service!  Even the guy who came out with the food was super nice.  I ordered the Signature Plater, which is 3 tacos with rice and beans.    I got the fish taco, pollo and carnitas.   Presentation was great, definitely not sloppy.  The corn tortillas were fresh!  Rice and beans taste great! Avocado on the taco were fresh as well.  I do have to say the fish may have been cooked a little longer but nothing to be upset about.  All three tastes great!   Listen, if you're in the mood for some tacos or some good Mexican food on the go, you gotta check out this place while it's still a little quiet.  6 months from now you'll hate yourself when you have to wait 30 minutes to sit down.    There's one note I leave to the owner; when I walked in I could smell something unpleasant.  It wasn't from the bathroom and couldn't tell if it was from outside.  I hope you can fix this as it will stir away future taco lovers!"}
{"text":"I've been to Taqueria many times before and always enjoyed the food and experience, and this, I decided to order takeout from them on a night i didn't want to go out.   Bad idea.   It took less than the allotted 75-100 minutes for my food to arrive, but when it did it was lukewarm at best. It looked at though it had been thrown in the box, and on top of that the portions were tiny. I'm still in shock that I paid nearly $30 for this."}
{"text":"We bought a groupon to go here, The food was terrible. Chicken burrito was dry as dirt. Wish we had not purchase another groupon because we really do not want to go back! Very small portions and most items are al a cart, including limes! Guacamole was mostly tomatoes. Very little avocado. Server was new and did not know anything about Mexican food. Owner went around to every table and apologized for multiple problems. Owner ended up finishing waiting on us and the server stayed behind the counter."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more than I did.  I had the chicken tacos, which are marinated in Adobo spices, and they were somewhat flavourful, but they still fell flat. The soft shells were a bit cold and the tacos didn't seem all that warm overall, so that might have been part of the problem. The portions weren't very large, so it wasn't all that satisfying either.  The other reviews are pretty good, so I might be willing to give this place a second chance, but for now it's two stars."}
{"text":"This is true authentic Mexican food.  I had the shrimp and gringo taco- both were yummy. The salsa that came with chips was unique and tasty! The restaurant is clean and the owners are very helpful in understanding the menu."}
{"text":"Solid choice for good eats in Pineville!  Clean, great service, expansive menu, Mexican coke.  I tried a carnitas torta, it was loaded with lettuce, tomato, onion, black beans, jalapeno, avocado and oh yeah, roasted pork! They were super nice, it will be on heavy rotation, my favorite thing is they open at 10a!  Breakfast of champions."}
{"text":"We usually get our pupusas from El Pulgarcito but they are always SO GREASY. So I decided to look for a new place. They were non-greasy and their curtido was great as well. Thank you for our new go-to place!"}
{"text":"If you know what you're getting into it's probably ok.  The salsa and chips is not like other Mexican restaurants in any way.  I was not a huge fan and they charge if you want extra chips.  Tacos are mostly authentic style with cilantro and onions not American with lettuce, tomato etc.  It's a small place and as others have said the service is sufficient but not overly impressive.  The prices are certainly reasonable, but I will check out some other Mexican restaurants to see if I can do better."}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner the other night. Everything was excellent. I got 3 tacos and all were tasty. Loved that they have a chorizo taco. Margaritas were delicious and they have homemade horchata. Check this place out."}
{"text":"My husband and I are in search for a new mexican restaurant in our neighborhood.  I used my Yelp App to suggest higher rated restaurants in the area we were in.  We had 7 option but Taqueria clearly shined above the rest in ratings.  The environment is very simple, which is perfectly fine with us.  We ordered from the menu but were told we couldn't get things we ordered (i.e. enchilada a la carte).  I ordered two tacos, one al pastor and one asada.  My husband ordered the enchilada platter (couldn't get a la carte and I couldn't get my tacos as a combination).  I received my tacos in normal time.  However, after 15 minutes of picking at my tacos ( I didn't want to be rude to my husband who was waiting for his food) I finished and we chose to pay the bill and not get my husbands enchiladas, which btw were still not ready.  I must say, the al pastor taco was good but my asada taco was exceptional.  I would love to say I will go back because the asada taco was probably one of the best I've had but the wait and complications for ordering outweigh the taste of the food and don't believe I'll return.  In defense of the servers, they were very polite and then apologetic.  Tough choice but going out to eat with someone and not being able to eat together just isn't my kind of restaurant."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Great traditional style taco stand tacos. This place is small and clean, I had a steak tacos and a carnitas. Both were excellent. Great prices too.  This place is a little hard to find, but it is worth the search."}
{"text":"We picked this place based on the Yelp reviews and I have to say it was pretty good. I'm not a huge authentic Mexican food fan and this was definitely authentic but it was good. I had the Barbacoa taco, the chicken taco, and the carnitas taco. All were good and everything is home made at this place. We also ordered the flautas appetizer which was also good, however the dinner portion was brought out instead of the appetizer. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was their salsa. I was definitely looking for more heat in it and that is just a personal preference. You could tell that it was made with fresh ingredients there. The guac was good had a good lime zing to it. My boyfriend had the same thing I did minus the chicken taco. He decided to try the beef tongue taco instead and he really liked it!!  There was a small altercation about a check between another customer and the owner. Mostly it was the customer yelling in spanish and the owner gracefully trying to accommodate him. After the customer left the owner came over to apologize and inquire about out meal. He was so nice and gracious and honestly made us feel really good about supporting a local mom and pop establishment. Without us even mentioning it he questioned the flautas order saying he wasn't sure which we wanted so he erred on the bigger portion but only charged us the appetizer rate. Really nice family run business who will treat you very well :)"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. A delightful experience to eat legitimate Mexican food. Lengua, carnitas, and chorizo tacos were great. The owners are friendly and humble and great cooks.  We were talking about legit Mexican food in Northern Virginia and I said that I've never had good tripa (tripe)  They brought me a little complimentary taco to try. It was fantastic and tender beyond belief.  Do yourself a huge favor and stop in."}
{"text":"I come here every couple of weeks and I think I discovered it's the same place that used to be in Cumberland (just moved and expanded).  I never knew the name of the place under Cumberland...we just called it burrito place in Cumberland.    From the new location though, I've had:  -Beef burrito 3/5 -Beef tacos  2/5 -Surf and turf burrito bow 2.5/5  The burritos are huge and tasty and the tacos aren't bad.  What I like is that they cook all the food fresh and it tastes much better than the old place under Cumberland.   I was a bit disappointed by the burrito bowl.  When I order a bowl, I expect it to be in a taco shell bowl (hence the name \"burrito bowl\").  It wasn't bad, but not what I was expecting, it was just salad with rice with meat.  It'd be more appropriate to call it \"burrito platter or taco platter or meat with rice and salad\".  I think I'll stick to burritos from this place, but it's nothing special.  Still decent though."}
{"text":"Came here based on other yelp reviews. We came in, the server was extremely nice and sat us instantly.   I ordered 6 various tacos. While getting our food took a little bit, it was well worth the wait.  Very flavorful. Unlike the other negative reviews, the meats were juicy and tender. Well worth it, and it seemed like good value for the money.  Chips and salsa was decent. I enjoyed the salsa as it was different from most places and still spicy and delicious."}
{"text":"Meh. It was ok. Had the tilapia burrito, medium hot. The burrito was huge, but lacked in flavour and was too spicy (for medium). There are several other burrito places I would go back to (e.g., Mucho Burrito, Chipotle, Burrito Boyz) before going back here."}
{"text":"Please eat here! Amazing! The tacos are irresistible. The salsa is spicy and flavorful! The drinks are fabulous. Make sure you get the Horchata Borracha! Amazing.  The service is spectacular and the food is even better.  The sopapilla is so flavorful and tasty.  I really wished I lived near this place because I'd be broke.  If you're in the area you must eat here."}
{"text":"Service is a bit spotty but great food made it all worth it."}
{"text":"We came with the kids because of all the reviews. First we had the most friendly and helpful servers, right away ready to explain what are their best dishes. We had the fish taco, the carnitas Mexicana taco and sopes with steak. Yes, it took a few minutes and worth every second because you could tell it was all fresh and homemade. Seriously, so incredibly good. Loved the easy casual atmosphere, and that you can order just a taco or 2 and don't have to commit to some big pricey \"combination dinner\" garbage! This is real fantastic Mexican and we can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food in Charlotte!  Not easy to find. The guacamole is made fresh to order and tastes as good as you'd expect. The tacos are great; I really like their chorizo. This is the first time I've found elote in Charlotte!  Corn with cheese and chili. Tres leches cake and flan are both great choices."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I REALLY enjoyed our meal last night (the shrimp tacos are amazing) and plenty to be enjoyed for a VERY reasonable price. Carnitas plate was delicious and the sides and salsas were very good.   Will definitely be going back!   P. S. Good selection of beers and on Fridays they're only $1.50 which is hard to beat anywhere!"}
{"text":"Having moved to the Queen city from SoCal where authentic Mexican food rules, I can say that this is the closest you will get to good Mexican food around this area. I am talking about food that is not drenched in melted cheese, canned tomato salsa, or tacos made from ground meat and on a hard shell. This is Mexican home cooking. The food served here and their flavors are what I am used to growing up on Mexican food. The place is a family owned business that cooks every dish to order and they try their best to serve their food as quickly as possible without compromising quality. This will be a good place to try if you have never had a chance to eat authentic Mexican, and the place to go if you are a West coast transplant yearning for true tacos."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the humble exterior and lack of decor- this place rocks! According to our waitress they just opened.  Everyone who helped me was super enthusiastic, willing to take the time to explain menu items & chat. This place seems geared around \"to go\" orders but there was still plenty of seating in the spotless dining area.  My boyfriend & I shared a taco dorado plate and a flautas plate. Both were delicious, crispy, and obviously freshly prepared. The sauce and rice they came with were perfectly seasoned, I can't speak for the refried beans because I didn't try them but apparently they were tasty. The horchata and flan were both also worthwhile.  In summary: great food, great service, and good prices earn a solid 5 star from me - I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  All of the ingredients are fresh.  They don't have a lot of really heavy dishes loaded with sour cream and cheese but you don't miss any of that unhealthy stuff at all because the dishes are perfectly prepared.  I highly recommend the shrimp tacos with the salsa verde, avocado cream sauce, and cilantro from the fresh bar.  In summary, healthy, authentic, fresh and delicious.  If you think chipotle or other chains have fresh ingredients, trust me, this place puts them to shame.  We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"\"I don't like that there's no one in here,\" said my date, and she meant it in the best way possible. That sums it up. YOU SHOULD GO! I don't write many reviews but felt compelled to share our experience of Taqueria.  Service: the restaurant is family owned by an adorable, super friendly and gracious couple. The husband greeted us and took us all the way through the menu before turning it over to his wife and going back to the kitchen to await the order. They are incredibly nice and modest people. That alone set this dinner apart from so many. They truly want you to enjoy your meal  - and most importantly - come back!  Decor: this is a no frills strip-mall-small place which looks like it was previously a order at the counter joint converted into a small restaurant. I would say there were 10 tables total. But everything was very clean. You can't expect too much and we weren't looking for anything fancy.  No +/- points here.   Drinks: the special was a drink called a Fresca. Super delicious and refreshing, almost like a fresh margarita combined with grapefruit soda. Only $3.99, and they came in these awesomely festive 'jarritos'.   Food: the owner told us verbally (it's also on the menu) that since they make everything fresh to order, it may take longer than other Mexican places to get your food. Well, it only took 5 minutes for ours, so faster than those places anyway! The food was indeed extremely fresh and delicious. We had an assortment of tacos (Carnitas, Campechano, Gringo with chicken, Fish taco). They were all fantastic, but the Fish and Campechano stood out to me. The Carnitas was also really really good, my date's fave. Fish was crispy, flaky, and the sour cream sauce tangy and delicious. The meat was all very tender and flavorful, piled high in each taco. They don't skimp on ingredients. We also had a wet chicken burrito, which was awesome as well, doused in mild salsas and queso. YUM! We didn't have chips and salsa, but the salsa that came with the dishes was a roasted chipotle tomato salsa and was def on the hot side. I'd ask for some pico, green, or mild next time.   And they were even offering coupons on Groupon and Yelp, but the prices are extremely reasonable at ~$10 / person + drinks.   You owe it to yourself to go here if you love fresh Mexican food and want to support a local place."}
{"text":"We went there for the 4th time tonight and for all those haters.... I don't know what you're talking about. This place continues to be good! My boyfriend and I are VERY picky when we go out to eat and this place continues to never disappoint. We are always greeted at the door and the service is always a ten! The salsa with the chips and salsa was different this time (very spicy) which we love!!! We got the traditional tacos (chorizo, pastor, lengua, asada, and carnitas) all were fresh, hot and delicious! We asked for extra lime and cilantro which our server brought out well before our meal so we had it. For dessert we got the tres leches cake. AMAZE BALLS! Who ever rates this place as fair or poor is on another planet and doesn't know Mexican food. I travel to Puerto Vallarta to see my parents an a yearly basis And the traditional tacos are just like getting them down there.  Love this place and it's a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"More of a 3.5 star, but a solid lunch option!  I had a SALAD which I thought was really good value. It was $8, I had the barbacoa, it came served with lots of lettuce, salad, fresh guac, tasty black beans, a good portion of meat (I skipped the sour cream and cheese). The portion was large. Nearby customers eating burritos looked like they had an adequate portion too.  My friend had the crispy tacos, she tried shrimp ($8). They didn't come with any sides and although she said they were super tasty, the portion size was tiny compared to my salad, as the 3 tacos didn't come with anything. (They should add a small side salad or something to make it an adequate lunch).  Toppings were all very fresh and they had some interesting menu items. We waited about 5 mins for our food, not bad considering it was 12:15pm, prime lunch hour."}
{"text":"Wow!!  Great food and super nice staff. Great selection of drinks, great weekly specials and ample portions. I will definitely be a return customer!"}
{"text":"After a run on a nearby greenway, I was looking to refuel. Stopped here and boy was I glad I did. The man working the counter was an absolute delight. He welcomed me in and proceed to explain the WHOLE menu.   All I wanted were tacos. But he was on a roll, so I let him finish. The tacos were delicious and made in lightning speed. I was out of there in 5 minutes. I had the pollo, carne asada, and al pastor. All were delicious. I definitely recommend stopping here. If not for the food, stop for a person who is nice and happy doing what he does. You seldom get that anymore. Support this small business!!! Please."}
{"text":"I went here looking for quick bite. Got the shrimp tacos. I was kinda disappointed that I could not mix and match tacos, and was forced to get 3 of the same kind of tacos...  Anyways the food was good, but not inspiring.  Also found the staff kinda of dry."}
{"text":"Good tasting food. No atmosphere. No chips and salsa come with a $23 order.  EXTREMELY OVERPRICED."}
{"text":"Coworkers and I go here for lunch and all I can say is amazing!  The owners are so proud of the food that they serve and are always willing to make recommendations.  As the other review said don't be fooled for the look of the place you will not be disappointed.  The last time I had this beef cooked in it's own juices and want to just keep going back for more.  We tried the churros OMG delicious!  Definitely do not just drive by this place!"}
{"text":"Very impressed!  We just moved to Charlotte from TX, and haven't had the best of luck finding Mexican restaurants we would go back to after the first visit.  This place is great though, and we definitely plan to go back for more.  You can't go wrong with the tacos!"}
{"text":"First off, I want to mention that I had originally thought to give this place 3 stars...but I'll get to that shortly.  The food was....well, it was food.  Definitely food.  No doubt about it.  The food was similar to the street vendors and hole in the wall places I've seen in Tucson, AZ....but noticeably more greasy.  But the spices were what I was used to.  I just don't think they were used in the best way.  I walked in hungry and walked out not hungry.  In my book that's enough to get 3 stars...as long as nothing else goes wrong.  I'm not going say that the service was truly awful, but it was apathetic enough to drop the overall rating to 2 stars."}
{"text":"Good food. Nothing to rave about but no complains here. Very nice / friendly staff. No hard tacos :( but i guess that's what you get when you go authentic. There is 1 thing that my wife and I didn't not like at all was their sweet tea. Whatever they are using to make it can't be natural. Fake sugar or powder tea... something is really wrong with it."}
{"text":"Looking for authentic tacos in south Charlotte - saw yelp reviews and decided to try. Server was very friendly. Tacos were pretty good too.  The strangest thing was the terrible odor when you walk in the door - smells like a dirty bathroom and harsh chemical cleaner, it was almost too much to take during our meal. I've seen a few other reviews about this odor which i just can't get over.  If that were fixed - I would absolutely go back. The prices, tacos and server were all good but can't get over that smell!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Charlotte hands down, authentic and ran by super nice people. Great service."}
{"text":"Great food, great people! The owners are wonderful people who aim to please. They will explain everything and will make changes as requested. It's a small, new place, so don't expect anything fancy, but everything is fresh, authentic, and made-to-order. I highly recommend the horchata! Tacos are on the small side, so EAT MORE OF THEM :)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my food. I would love to give a higher rating. But, I won't. I'm just glad I ordered take-out. Upon walking in there was an odor that would make Robert Irvine gag.  Why I stayed, I have no idea. Other than I already committed myself by purchasing an online discounted certificate.  I will say they didn't leave me hungry that is for sure.  I also ordered a kids portion for a co-worker. They seem nickel and dime you on things. The kids taco only came with meat - so they charged extra because she wanted lettuce and cheese on top.  The could be a little less stingy on the amount of salsa they give with a takeout order, that's fo sho.  The frustrating part of the experience is I wanted some cheese sauce. They only had one size and it was priced pretty salty ... If you know what I mean.  But, it basically went straight to thicker than wallpaper paste after sitting for a few minutes. You could say it got harder, quicker than an old man poppin' those lil' blue pills. No bueno - as the kids say nowadays.  But, I repeat, the food was actually perty durn tasty. [Two taco plate: Shrimp and Gringo Chicken]  The decision is up to you, 'Merica!   [Probably look for an online discounted certificate to help offset the dinero.]"}
{"text":"Place is a hidden gem! Plenty of parking spots! We were immediately greeted. Server was so friendly and helpful. She gave us suggestions and answered all our questions. I got the shrimpadilla. It was huge! Flavorful and spicy which I love! There was so much shrimp. Avocados were fresh. Pico was delicious and the salsas on it was bursting with flavor. It would be really hard to not get it again. My fiancé got 5 traditional tacos all with different meats. Chips were crispy and the salsa that came with it was delicious and spicy. Loved it so much. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Saturday night and only three other dinners came in. My husband's asada tacos were bland and my cheese enchiladas were dry and flat. Not sure how this place has such good reviews. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was delicious ! Will definitely come back for more !!! I had 4 tacos all different kinds which was a great suggestion because all were so yummy"}
{"text":"My gosh, between the authentic fundido, to the exquisitely crafted tacos, you cannot go wrong! The menu is right sized, giving the kitchen staff focus on creating traditional dishes with outstanding attention to detail. The staff was effective and efficient, and were continually available. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Ok so I never ever post reviews but I just had to on this one. This restaurant claims to be authentic Mexican... very far from authentic. We went there on Sunday early in the day and I ordered a veggie taco and a sope in which the tortilla was not good at all. I have eaten tons of tacos and real Mexican tacos they are usually heated on a comal or fried in oil for a second and the sope, once I got to the middle the masa was somewhat raw. My son and husband who are Mexican loves Tacos and they were very disappointed with the food. My son ordered 3 tacos de asada and didn't even get through the second one. My husband ordered tacos de lengua and tripe and was sooo disappointed. The only good thing was the salsa that they give you with the little bit of chips. Never again."}
{"text":"Didn't care about this place. Service was VERY slow. Soup was flavorless. The fish Taco was too fishy for my taste. My husband's skirt steak taco was good, but that was about it. Place is clean and small. Tacos are between $1.89 to $2.99 each. I will not be returning again"}
{"text":"You want the Shrimpsadilla.  Very generous portions of avocado over shrimp and delightfully spicy cheese.  If you like quesadillas, you can't go wrong here. Excellent, polite staff members.  * Absolutely heartbroken that they have closed and wish them well now and in the future. *"}
{"text":"The server was very very nice, and did a great job checking on me. Everyone there was really nice, but the carne asada tacos i had, were not so good. Something about them, just wasnt right. Not very much taste. I also asked for extra onions and cilantro, and seemed to have gotten less than what would be normal. All in all, i wold not come here for carne asada tacos. Maybe something else is good on their menu...."}
{"text":"Came here for a quiet weeknight dinner with my girlfriend. The place is family owned with fantastic service and wonderful, authentic tacos. You can tell they care about their food and how it tastes and looks! I had 4 different tacos containing chorizo, beef tongue (delicious!), barbacoa, and pork. My girlfriend has fish tacos which she expressed a love for as well. At ~$2.00 per taco or less it would be hard not to make this a regularly visited place to get great food."}
{"text":"Absolutely the WORST, DISGUSTING and REPULSIVE Mexican food I'd ever had.   Our night first started out with high hopes. With all the great reviews we couldn't but not check \"Taqueria\" out.  Our party of three were seated right away. We waited a few minutes for our waitress to take our drink orders. She soon explained that she was new. (Which completely gives me the reason on to why she was such an incompetent,  inattentive, and down right an air head)   We received our chips and salsa-after having to ask. Salsa was surprising solid. Chips hard. Overall incredible stingy. We had to ask for extra chips and salsa compared to an average \"authentic Mexican restaurant\" multiple times.   Now the food. Chicken enchiladas were dry. Our kids meal came with fries- what are we living in Alabama? (Menu did not specify sides for the children menu.) Tortillas, cheese, rice well everything on the menu tasted store bought.   If I knew how grotesque the food was going to be I would have happily have gone through the drive through at Taco Bell. At least there's a reason why their food is poor.    Overall maybe it's because this place is extremely lucky, possibly the people of Charlotte have no taste buds or the chef/ chefs just had a bad night. Please save your money, your mouth and your stomach. If your getting an itch for Mexican go to \"Azteca\"."}
{"text":"After two visits, I have tried the chicken tacos, barbacoa and fish tacos, as well as chips and salsa and Refried beans. Unlike other Mexican restaurants, Taqueria is fresh, light, and delicious. Although the owners and servers are extremely friendly the service is very slow because, from my two visits, it appears to be just the two of them. Upon arriving both times I waited at the door because the wife was in the back cooking. However, upon being seated, she explained everything, and when I say everything, she went thought the entire menu, as well as gave me her recommendation. Overall, the food is too die for, but I do wish they would get a few more servers and offer a little better salsa for the chips. I will be back."}
{"text":"Oh Taqueria... I tried, I really did. I've bought nearly every dish you guys sell, but, alas, it was not meant to be.  The location is gold. That is why I kept coming back and giving you all those chances. I'm sorry to be comparing you to big guys like Chipotle, but honestly... this is supposed to be mexican food... The first time I had one of your burritos I thought it was a fluke. I thought it couldn't possibly always be THIS BLAND. I've given you guys many many chances afterwards to prove me wrong and become one of my regular lunch spots.   Every other dish after my first burrito was bland as well. The portions were good for me (I'm a small gal that doesn't eat that much), but I'm just missing that kick of flavour that you expect out of burritos and nachos..  Overall, very disappointed and will not be back. I hope you guys will take a better look at your recipes and throw some flavour into your food sometime soon. Until then, ta ta."}
{"text":"3.5 stars   We decided to stop by last night for a quick dinner and ordered a takeout chicken chimichanga to split. Upon waking in, I found Taqueria to be a small hole in the wall joint. It's nothing fancy by any means but I wouldn't let the decor deter you. The have a reasonable menu as far as selection and price go. The service seemed good as well.   I paid about $10 for my order, it was very light. I didn't think enough beans and rice were given. (Docked half a star) The chimichanga was on the smaller side as well. I loved the Spanish rice, very flavorful and seasoned. I was not a fan of the beans, the texture was very off putting. I couldn't get passed it, (docked a star). I did like the chimichanga, the chicken consisted of perfectly seasoned, good white chicken. I just wish it was a little bigger and there was a little more queso on top.   We will be back, hopefully it was just an off day on the beans."}
{"text":"Excellent chimichanga!! We also Had three street tacos 1 fish 1 shrimp 1 tongue  Delicious!! Excellent margarita and excellent guacamole!!! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places.  We ended up here, because we were craving tacos and looking for the best priced authentic tacos in CLT. We had just tryed Casa Ritas and it was not satisfying, taco bell is equivalent.. Anyways so we went to Taquerias about a 20 min drive from home. The first impression isn't great. We were one of the only two parties dining at the time. We ordered a variety of the tacos. The chips and sales is always a plus. The tacos and sauses were very good.  For Valentine's day we were on Pineville Matthews rd going to Japanese restaurant. It was a 2 hour wait, we were so dissapointed. But Taqueria was 3 minutes away. We went and tried some different items. Needless to say, the food was great as always. I enjoyed my dish, the Gorditas and would recommend it for sure! With the salasas. We had a fantastic Valentine's day and like I said, Taquerias is one of my favorite spots.   Great food, very pleasant customer serves, always leave Happy!"}
{"text":"Finally a place that makes Pozole! Now I'm used to my boyfriends family's Pozole, which is perfection. This stuff came pretty close, but not quite how I like it. My boyfriend had their tacos, which were a bit dry (had to take broth from my soup to make them juicy...uht oh!) but overall he said they were pretty good. The beers we ordered were a little on the flat side it seemed, but we enjoyed them none the less. The salsa served with the chips is a little lack luster, so hopefully they change it up. The service was subpar at first (the young boy pretty much forgot about us, but then a young girl took care of us). The manager/owner came over to chat a bit, which was very nice. Will come back to try something else, and hopefully update this review!"}
{"text":"Great staff, best salsa I've had.  All around good people and good food. The shrimpsadilla is where it's at.  There are a lot of good Mexican restaurants in the area and this one is going on the normal rotation."}
