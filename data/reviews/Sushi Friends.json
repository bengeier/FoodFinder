{"text":"Pretty dece sushi restaurant. I rolled in here to pick up some takeout in celebration of being recovered enough from throat surgery to eat solid food again. I didn't have to wait too long and the food was good. Not amazing -- but good. After all that time away from sushi though, I didn't care. I loved it. I was happy, and with a salmon bento for 11 bucks it was worth it."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating full sushi plate in toronto. And i loved it. It was fresh, testy fairly priced and very nice presentation.
I went for the menu rather than the all you can eat. There is so many choices im sure anyone can find what satisfies their needs."}
{"text":"I have such a mixed review of this place. I've gone many time. Too many to count. The most recent time I went my All you can eat was pretty good. But with this place it's a hit or miss.   The sushi could be awesome one time and just taste...off other times. Service is pretty standard. No one can speak English or they don't converse with customers at least. But whatever you need, they will bring it to you. But sometimes friendly service is a big part of the dining experience. I'm sure I'll be back. I've never been sick from eating their food, bloated YES  but never sick"}
{"text":"Great Lunch Special !!!

This is one of the best lunch deals in the city.  
We have visited Sushi Friends a few times.

For an unbelievable $5.50, I ordered the Combo B, you get an excellent meal which includes:
* Green Tea and water to drink
* Miso Soup
* Green Salad
* California Rolls
* Vegetable Tempura
* Teriyaki Chicken
* Steamed Rice
* Fresh Fruit
* They even top it off with Ice Cream dessert: I like the Mango

If you are inkling for some Japanese Sushi and are on The Danforth, you can't beat Sushi Friends."}
{"text":"very nice place to be, if you want a good meal, all you can eat is my favorite.  Service is so so but the food & convenient location make it up."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday March 30th for a group outing with work. We had the AYCE (all you can eat) for $16.95. It was super easy to find (right outside Chester subway station, on the Danforth)
I am by no means a sushi expert so I won't be able to give a critical review on how well the sushi was rolled or anything like that. All I know is that it tasted so good! We must've ordered like 15 plates of food, as there were about 10 of us. The service was good, never had to wait for a fork very long! And the food came out piping hot (chicken gyoza, chicken teriyaki). It seemed really clean the atmosphere was perfect for what we came for. I can't wait to go back and have more sashimi!!"}
{"text":"This is now my go to place for lunch. They have a large selection of set meals to choose from and the bill is $10-11 including tax and tip. My favourite lunch item is the salmon sushi combo which comes with 8 salmon rolls, 4 pieces of salmon sushi and a salmon hand roll. I have also tried their tempura and sushi pizza. The tempura is good but the sushi pizza not to my taste with pieces of chopped green pepper and onions underneath the salmon. 

This place is great for lunch - the service is great and fast. They also accommodate strollers for those that have infants."}
{"text":"This is one of the new sushi restaurants that has opened on the Danforth recently.  It has a similar decor to Casa Sushi, with a clean motif of brown/cream lines. 

We went for all-you-can-eat dinner on a Saturday night. It was quite a comfortable atmosphere, and the staff were great. Our waiter even described every single item we ordered. It was slightly cold, though, inside. We ordered four different rolls as well as a sashimi platter. The rolls were disappointing.  We had ordered a Dynamite roll, California roll, BBQ salmon skin roll, and a sweet potato tempura roll. With the exception of the salmon skin roll, they were basically indistinguishable from each other. They were rolled well and there wasn't too much rice, but the flavours were bland.  My friend commented that the sweet potato one tasted old even.  The sashimi was alright.  The salmon was cut inconsistently, however.  

We also ordered some kitchen food, and almost everything was deep fried. 

With all the sushi restaurants on the Danforth available, I don't think this one would be my first choice."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's clean, the fish is fresh, great service and affordable. Definitely try the Friends Roll and the sushi pizza! The AYCE has a nice selection. We've been many times and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Sometimes this place is good but with all the other options around it's not worth it. 
My boyfriend and I have been going here for over 3 months (biweekly) and today was terrible. The service was almost not existent, they don't even try to hide that nothing is fresh, missing dishes, I saw the sushi chef put papers on people for before it got to the table and the fried food was soggy from sitting in the back to long. Normally it's not that bad but today was terrible. 
There are much better sushi places down the street."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow and the food came before the appetizers. The sushi wasn't the freshest Iv had but the tempura was very good."}
{"text":"I have been to sushi friends many times overall it's good but it's not consistent... There are days when the sushi is amazing and there are days where it doesn't taste right. Now I don't know if it's because of the sushi chef has his off days or there being some other reason but it's sad to see that they can't stay consistent with the taste of the sushi... Service is average but there are some employes who you can really got the F**k my life expression written all over their face."}
{"text":"Two stars for overall experience. Food would have scored three stars, not outstanding but okay. Unfortunately the food was dragged down by a very unfriendly staff, quite remarkably unfriendly... I guess they get by on foot traffic since it's hard to imagine coming back."}
{"text":"These guys have pretty good sushi (not great) and all-you-can-eat! Come hungry if you want to take advantage of the all-you-can-eat. Ice-cream included in all-you-can-eat, so save room if you like desert."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I have been here twice, by myself, on a weeknight.  Twice in two weeks I might add.  It's All-You-Can-Eat or order off the menu.  I have a small appetite so I ordered off the menu.  The staff are very friendly right off the bat.

First time I went:
I liked the atmosphere, dim lighting, calm colour choices, clean and relaxing.  I ordered miso soup, green salad and a Dynamite Roll.  The soup and salad were nice, especially the soup.  My roll came quickly and I was very surprised how large the pieces were!  It was delicious.  After I finished the watier offered me complimentary ice cream.  I happily ordered the green tea ice cream.

My bill came and again I was pleasantly surprised at the low price.

Second time I went:
I ordered the same thing as last time.  My salad was not as good as last time but it was okay.  The soup was great.  My Dynamite Roll was not as a big as last time, it was normal sized.  I was still a bit hungry after my meal so I ordered some Edemamme.  It was tasty.  They offered me ice cream again but this time I declined.

I would recommend this place.  I looked at what people ordered for the All you Can Eat option and it looked impressive.  They can accomodate large groups with ease.

I look forward to bringing a friend here :)"}
{"text":"Went here for all you can eat lunch on a Saturday. The experience was definitely very good, with a nice atmosphere (not loud, clean, family-friendly, and nice d√©cor), friendly staff and a good price! It was $16.99 per person, and the selection was pretty good! (see the photo I uploaded of the selection list). The sushi was far from the greatest I've ever had, but totally understandable and reasonable for the price and for all you can eat. I would definitely go again when in the Danforth and looking for AYCE sushi!"}
{"text":"This has been my Go-To sushi place since 5 years ago. The service for dine in is not the best but could be better. The reason why i love the place is because i love the deals that they have for lunch and dinner, and i'm talking about the $5-$12.50 bento boxes that really fills me up. The cheapest lunch bento is around $6 with tax and it comes with miso soup, salad, 3 pc of sushi, fruit, rice and bean sprouts with teriyaki chicken, ect... which isn't bad for $6. For dinner i usually get the bigger bento's that ranges around $9 which includes veggie tempura, 2 spring rolls, chicken teriyaki, rice, soup, salad, 6 pc sushi, and fruit. I haven't tried the AYCE or all you can eat but my nice cheap/filling bento gets me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Tried the AYCE menu on a Thursday night. The selection is not as extensive as some of the other spots.  They only have the basic maki and handrolls,  and only four types of sashimi - salmon, red snapper, butterfish and crab. The quality of the sashimi is nothing to rave about either. I prefer AYCE places with more sashimi options so this wasn't for me. 

The service was a little slow at first because there seemed to be only one person preparing the sushi, but the servers were friendly and attentive.  

We paid 18.99 and my friend got a bottle of Sapporo for 4.50"}
{"text":"I live on the Danforth and it seems as though the Japanese restaurants have taken over Greektown over the past few years. Sushi Friends used to be my go-to AYCE sushi spot, but not anymore.

First of all, customer service is a big downfall at this place. There are two servers that I really enjoy having when I come into this place, but past that, you get Asian women with b*tchface and a big dose of \"f*ck my life\". Customer service is a deal breaker for me and it really changes my mood on the whole place when it's not that great.

Second, they really o.d. you on the avocado. I know it's an easy filler, but sushi doesn't taste as great when you've got a truckload of avocado and hardly any fish. 

The menu is good, but now that I've expanded my horizons of AYCE sushi places, I've seen much better. For the price that you pay at Sushi Friends, you might as well hop on the subway, get off at Spadina Station, and find a better place at around King St.

They are really quick though which is good and they never mess up your orders. One thing that I do have to say is, if you ever get a chance to walk up to the sushi bar- please do. You will discover the reason as to why their service is so fast- they pre-make all their rolls and leave them sitting there to be cut up when needed. Gross."}
{"text":"Not ordering from here again. We ordered a sushi tray tonight and it arrived pretty fast.

I think they pre make all their rolls because these were definitely not fresh! They tasted like sushi that had been sitting in a fridge over night and the rice was all dried out , fish was fishy tasting.

Sushi Bay has much better quality sushi at a similar price. Maybe sushi friends is better to sit down and eat in but honestly I feel like I wasted a lot of
Money I didn't even finish the food and had to throw it out 

Only good thing was the fast delivery but I'm guessing it's only fast since it's pre made Sushi"}
{"text":"Sushi Friends is my go-to sushi restaurant. They offer all you can eat menus for lunch and dinner but I usually just order from their regular menu. I recently got #80 on their menu and my friend and I were amazed by their fresh sashimi. It comes with miso soup and salad. The soup is average but the salad is different. And I mean different in a good way. The salad dressing is an orange colour but I'm glad it's not a white mayo looking dressing that other sushi places serves. The restaurant has comfortable seating, a patio and a tv for entertainment. The decor and environment is cozy and modern. Maybe the waiters need a bit of improvement on their service though... But overall I love the food and I guess that's what really matters! I love the freshness and presentation and of course the taste. Whenever you're roaming around Greektown and you're craving for sushi, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I've been to a million AYCE sushi places in the GTA so I have a good sense of what \"average\" is. This place has a different philosophy. Their menu is noticeably smaller, but their price is also lower. 

IMO this is perfectly fine. Often there are only a few items that I like anyways. I'm happy to pay a few bucks less to get exactly what I want. 

In terms of quality, it's about the same as any other place. Chinese owned. Don't expect to be pampered by service, which is average."}
{"text":"This place is A-OK. It's close to where I work and it's once of the cheaper AYCE locations there (there are a few other sushi/ayce sushi places nearby). Went with a co-worker after a shift. The first thing I noticed was the strong fish smell when we walked in. NOT a good sign. I was very apprehensive about eating here. It wasn't as bad as I feared, the fish/food, but I will never go back. That initial smell is so unappealing.

We ordered a bunch of stuff. A lot of salmon sashimi, with a few other types of sashimi (it mostly tasted okay-good with the exception of the \"crab\" sashimi which came out cold like it was just taken out of those frozen packages from the grocery store. Some of the rolls included Spicy Salmon (did not enjoy), red dragon roll (was okay) and Salmon Avocado roll (again okay). The cooked foods were a bit better. The Beef Tereyaki was overdone, but the beef and onion rolls were yummy. The spicy chicken was too spicy and too hot (temperature wise) but the salmon tereyaki was good.

I think the Danforth has a great selection of places to eat, and while it doesn't seem to be lacking in sushi options, this particular one does not seem like it's worth it."}
{"text":"Ayce price is cheap yes, but the menu lacks a lot of items you'd find at other restaurants. 

We also waited a long time to get our first order. The most filling & cheap items (coincidentally?) came first. We didn't get our sushi for about half an hour after handing in the sheet. Food was coming out so slowly that we would finish everything they gave us and sit without food again for a few minutes before the next dish arrived. 

The second (smaller) order we made came out much faster though. However by this point we waited so long for the first order that their strategy of going slow worked, we weren't that hungry anymore. 

To sum it up, it's cheaper but you get what you pay for. Perhaps the a la Carte is better here."}
{"text":"I went with a friend to there this weekend. It came up to be around $22 per person. There was only two of us and we basically finish with just one round.

The sashimi is pretty good, but just a bit warm for my liking. Big portions compare to other ones I go to. The rolls are huge, but I can eat with one bite. Definitely not the size i want my maki to be.

The selection ain't too bad. The orders came in quick because there were only like 2-3 tables besides us that night. You pretty get a landscape letter size paper split in to 3 columns.

I will have to say the service is superb. Not only do they come regularly to give us more water, everytime they collect the plates, they also help us shift the rest of the food near the middle for us. 

Not sure if I will go back, because of personal preferences, but it is definitely a nice place just to chill and enjoy sushi. For the price, the food is decent.

Besides AYCE, it also have a great menu for a la carte."}
{"text":"Came here for an early Sunday dinner with my pal. 

The decor inside is pretty nice w your choice of a booth or table.

They have AYCE ($15 on Mon - Thurs/$16 on Fri - Sun), but we decided to order individual rolls from the menu as we weren't too hungry. I had the chicken teriyaki and green dragon rolls. Nothing to write home about, but I'm also not completed and utterly disappointed. As Yelp would say, it was a-ok. Complimentary miso soup and dessert was a nice touch.

Service was great.

A-ok.
If you're in the area and jonesing sushi rolls, it'll do the trick."}
{"text":"People that think the food here is good probably need to try a place downtown. Or uptown. Or in Norway. This place is gross. I ordered snapper. I don't know what I was served, but it wasn't snapper. Mushy and disgusting. Easily the worst tamago I've ever eaten and I've been through some bad tamago (Mandarin for one, then there was the time I ordered the sashimi at Roll Roll and it was frozen, that was still better). The rice had a bizarre texture and no seasoning. I found eating the rice in the nigiri a bit like eating an over cooked boiled egg white. Very rubbery and bland. Almost with a hint of sliminess. The spicy avocado roll missed the spicy and the avocado was brown and slimy. The tempura wasn't really crisp and the yams were unevenly cooked, some soft and some still very crunchy. This quality of food doesn't match the price tag with most of the basics being at least a dollar more than most neighbourhood shops in the city.  On the upside, the tofu and salmon both seemed very fresh and I think the miso soup was one of the best I've tried in Toronto. In terms of service I wasn't satisfied. When I said thank you as dishes were delivered or water was poured the servers never replied with the customary \"You're Welcome\". They didn't smile unless they were picking on the sushi guy (which they did a lot and he would stop and yell at them for five minutes at a time, like literally stop making sushi to banter with the servers leading to sllloooowwww service), Anyway, I won't go back."}
{"text":"Went here along with him and I absolutely loved it. We ordered a lot of sushi but it came within a reasonable amount of time and everything tasted just delicious. My favourite was the avocado and yam roll. 

Service was average but in my experience I usually get the same type of service from sushi restaurants lol. 

It's all you can eat for $20 and conveniently located in the heart of the Danforth so I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always delicious  - ! Best sushi on danforth in my opinion. Nice atmosphere , lots of options, good quality , friendly staff."}
{"text":"So this is the ayce experience:

I decided to come back and give this place another shot. And boy, I was surprised. 

I came in around 2pm and the place eas dead. I paid 19.99 for the ayce. The tea was great, and while there was one server, things came out on time and it was a pleasant experience.

My biggest complaint last time was the sashimi, and that was a big improvement. The slices were thick and more less fresh. Occasionally, the cut wouldn't be even if there would be some frays, but overall I enjoyed it a lot. The rolls were a good size and the hand rolls weren't soggy.

The ice cream is good. The red bean is very good and I highly recommend it. Overall, a very solid visit and I'm very happy."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sushi Friends for years.  In the last year or two, though, I've seen a huge decline in the quality of the experience.  Mainly because of the staff.  They're never nasty, but the turnover has been unbelievable.  You never see the same staff members twice.  And Sushi Friends is always horribly understaffed.  The last time I went the one, single waiter was pleasant, but often confused and clearly way in over his head.  Completely inexperienced in waiting tables.  Loads of mistakes both from him and the kitchen staff who failed to deliver a third of what I ordered.  After my last trip to Sushi Friends I said \"No more.\"  I won't be returning.  It's too bad.  The food is quite good, but the staff problems just make the whole experience unpleasant.  Goodbye, Sushi Friends."}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks ago, and we decided on the AYCE dinner.  The price wasn't bad, and the quality was ok.  To be honest there wasn't anything particularly memorable.  I do remember having the sushi pizza, and we ordered a number of pieces of sushi and rolls.  The company was great, so I can't complain.  Also, I felt like it was clean."}
{"text":"The service was reasonably quick and friendly.  The price was reasonably priced and it's located in a fun busy neighborhood.  The food however is beyond bland and boring.  I seriously could not taste the difference between the rice and the salmon.  I suggest you skip this place."}
{"text":"FINALLY a sushi joint on the Danforth that offers BROWN RICE sushi. For a small price more. 

4 stars for that alone. The taste was not the very best, I hope they improve, I will go back because I always feel awful when I eat a lot of white rice.

The AYCE is not worth it for me, I don't eat that much, but I was able to get all I needed at less than the AYCE price, so fine."}
{"text":"Me and my CUTE! sushi buddy wanted to like this place. It's an AYCE sushi joint near her place. And it's got a pretty awesome name. Sushi friends. Like Super friends. But no capes or super powers beyond the ability to eat an unholy amount of salmon.

The good: well the basic sushi was good. Great salmon. Nice clean new place.

The bad: really limited AYCE selection. The chef seems to randomly pick and choose which of your ordered items he actually prepares. Despite our best efforts to order bbq spicy salmon and red snapper (twice) we never got it. 

The staff was friendly, however. Sometimes these places can have really, really surly wait staff. So I guess if you're going to have your ordered ignored, it's better if its ignored with a smile than a sneer."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. A cute mom and pa place. 

Ordered salmon lover which included spicy salmon roll, hand roll, and salmon sushi. It came with soup, salad, and ice cream at the end. $16 

The fish quality was on par with many ayce places, but the the rice caught me off guard because it was soft and sweet. I liked it. Very filling too.

You can pay with credit card."}
{"text":"Currently seeking a regular sushi place, this is not it. Just moved to a new apartment and need a good sushi place. I live at broadview and dundas so this one seemed the closet. I can't eat anything deep fried so I asked if I could have the vegetable steemed not fried and something instead of a spring roll (if they can't do it, no probs I'll find another item on the menu). She said she could but when my food came there were two servings of what I think is bean sprouts and when I asked about it she argued with me for a good 7 mins. Another server came to drop off my boyfriends bento and I asked her if my bento came with rolls (i forgot) and she yelled at me, 'they are right over there! i only have two hands!'.... rude. Also my boyfriend asked for beef, he got chicken. The rice was kind of hard and stale and the seaweed in the rolls was thick and tough. Bad service and didn't taste great. Also we both had upset stomachs. We will have to keep searching :("}
{"text":"I went there on a Friday night, and I must say, this definitely isn't one of the best sushi places I have been. They have both AYCE options and a la carte options. We ordered a Bento box and the Black Pearl Roll.

Let's start with food. My friend who lives in the area told me only their rolls are good. I didn't believe him until I took the first bite. The Black Pearl Roll consisted of deep fried goodies (I think it was shrimp?) wrapped nicely with avocado and fish roe on top. It tasted good and didn't totally fall apart when eaten. The rest of dinner was disappointing. The bento box was really mediocre at best. We ordered the special bento box they had. The fish for the bento box was no way near fresh. The beef was over cooked, the dynamite roll that it came with was loosely wrapped and was not good at all. 

Service was not great either. I understand this is a Friday night and you might be busy with customers who are ordering AYCE, but it would be nice if we could actually get our water filled for once without having to flag the waiters down multiple times.  

Overall, Black Pearl Roll is decent for takeout."}
{"text":"As far as all you can eat sushi goes, this place is a solid value for the money.

Yes, service is not brilliant, but it doesn't suck either.  Food comes out quickly and water refills (if slow) do happen. Everyone at my table was pleased with how quickly our orders came out.

The fish is quite fresh. The sushi rolls are not so thick with rice that you fill up on the rice. The hand rolls were fresh, but a bit heavy on rice and low on fish.

The restaurant is a small, yet clean space. I am glad I discovered Sushi Friends."}
{"text":"Very sad place to eat. some serious quality control needed. The ribs literally had no meat. maybe the rats got to it before it got to my table. Never will go back"}
{"text":"All you can eat with a 20% discount for the grand opening?! ya why not?!

PRICE
so my friends and I tried the AYCE here. With the discount, it came out to $20 (Tax +Tip included) for dinner. I don't know how much tip my friend made me pay but he just said give in a $20.  That's really not bad for an AYCE sushi place, especially on the Danforth.

FOOD
my friend ordered way too much food but the they did give us everything we ordered.  The sushi tasted ok. Nothing to rave about and nothing to complain about. The sashimi texture seemed pretty good and I was excited about that. 

I know everyone said the miso soup was tasteless but I somewhat remembered it tasting the same as other places like sushi delight. Maybe they read the reviews.

SERVERS
the wait staff brought us tea regularly which was great.  but they did seat us by the door which was freezing.   From what I remember, there were other available seats (event hough we were a group of 7)

The best part was that I didn't get sick. I think maybe that deserves a 4 star rating :) hehe.

I wouldn't rave about this place but I definitely would go again if my friends wanted to go."}
{"text":"I went here after yoga class for their bento lunches.  I thought it would be a good way to rejuvenate and feel zen.  I quite liked their bento lunches, they had a large variety and I especially like how they have boxes with both a hot item as well as sushi as oppose to just one or the other.  I like eating meals with a little bit of everything.

The bento box hit just the right spot and was so cheap!  With tax and tip I spent less than $10!  I sometimes feel that in order to enjoy the sushi experience, the non-AYCE option may be worth a shot.  I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner during the Taste of the Danforth. Considering that they were very busy, I thought that they did a good job handling the customers inside the restaurant. However, we ordered tempura twice and verbally asked for it a couple times and we never got our order. I think the part that irked us the most was when we saw them bring out a bucket of tempura out front to sell as part of Taste of the Danforth. Also, I saw that other tables got their tempura so it's not like other tables were neglected. I would not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Wow. How times change. This used to be a very cool AYCE but hadn't been in a year and went with a friend for his send off trip.  Can't express the desire I had for Japanese.  

While I can expect prices to go up as that does happen, I didn't expect quality to get so bad.  I mean - we are talking about bland and no flavour in the sashimi, sushi or rolls.  When we started going there, you could see there was an energy and passion with two chefs making food at dinner time, two servers and just the display and presentation looking fresher and tastier.  

The rice single and hand rolls seemed loaded with rice.  You can also tell when the establishment is worried about how much someone may order. They bring trays with the battered or rice heavy stuff first vs the sashimi.  But like I said, it was all bland.  

The single chef that worked that had a serious look and not sure if this was his normal demeanor or just angry.  The waitress was by herself but a little loose on the details.  Making sure we had water, more tea.  I don't drink alcohol But my friend does. Does that mean you don't check to ensure we are well hydrated.  

No flavour.  Very dry and even the sashimi was just missing any sense of flavour.   We've agreed this is our last time at Sushi Friends.  Sometimes it is hard to break a friendship but for the money, I'd say provide less options and focus on quality and taste to keep people coming back."}
{"text":"Goddamn why do they have to have such good deals?! I guess you get what you pay for though: over cooked rice and flavourless fish. They didn't even sprinkle sesame seeds on my rolls. Oh well."}
{"text":"Just want to balance out some of the average ratings.  I go here at least once a week.  I'm a sushi fiend and will even eat grocery store sushi if I'm desperate.  But the value and quality of  Sushi Friends is pretty unique in my experience.  I've never smelled an unpleasant fish smell in the place and the sushi has always been beautifully prepare and delicious.   The lunch specials are pretty unbelievable cheap too.   Please don't judge these guys on the basis of once bad review (or one stellar one either).  Please give these guys your consideration."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. It is just steps away from Pape station. The dining environment is great and the service was decent. The Sushi was decent but nothing spectacular. What I liked most about this place was the prices, you can have a decent filling meal for less than 15 dollars."}
{"text":"Sushi isn't usually my thing, I'm a sashimi/teriyaki girl, but their rolls are heavenly! The sashimi is very fresh and their tempura was beautiful.
The restaurant itself was very clean & modern. Good, friendly service and the food came ultra fast! Great value for your dollar. Definitely a new AYCE favorite!"}
{"text":"The service needs improvement. Being a server she should atleast try and accommodate the restaurants customers. Food wasn't great at all.... Sub the salmon rolls + cali for tempura shrimp rolls, and paid +3 and was so bad. Cold, not tasty. I got the bento box... I forget what it's called. Sushi pizza that came with it was dry and tasted bland. Asked for spicy mayo sauce instead of the regular mayo on the pizza and they were pretty cheap on that. Spent a total of $18 on a $8 bento box... and extra charge for the sub x2. The menu and its paired bentos are great deals. But eh... Might give it a try again, but I highly doubt it. Everything looked good, but looks are deceiving"}
{"text":"They have AYCE ($10.99 for lunch and $18.99 for dinner). There's also a bunch of great a la carte options, which I prefer over the AYCE. They are a bit more dignified and give you a good bang for the buck. You can get two or three types of rolls with a small salad and soup for less than $7! 

You can get a decent lunch for $20 for 2 people but it will feel like you've spent much more. The quality of the sushi is higher than typical AYCE places."}
{"text":"Ive been going to Sushi Friends for a year now. It was my favourite go to sport for bento boxes, take out or the All you can Eat.
The last few times things have been lacking. I thought it was just the servers being too in your face all the time, or not coming to the table at all.
A few weeks back, my husband and I were in for lunch and the servers were constantly at the table reaching over taking plates right out from under the last bite. Like, wait a few minutes and allow me to enjoy the bite I just took. I was litterally picking up a piece of tempura with the server trying to take the plate as I reached for it.
Then the next visit was wonderful! The server was nice and everything was fresh and hot. 
Todays visit was terrible. 
We went in for the AYCE menu. I asked for water and iced tea and got tap water and they forgot my ice tea....I started with edamame and miso soup and veggie tempura. My edamame came out ice cold in less than one minute. I asked if I could have fresh cooked beans and the server told me they were rinsing them in cold water now... Nope! These were ice cold.. Not hot on the inside and rinsed in cold water.  He then told me I could have fresh ones that these were fresh.. Well Im a cook and I knew they were at least 4 or 5 hours old. Then a few minutes later he brought out a bowl of steaming edamame beans to the booth beside us.! What?!
Moving on. The chicken we ordered came out luke warm, the calamari was clearly re fried a few times, not even edible. 
When we asked for a second menu to order rolls the server said we should order everything at once next time... umm why? Id rather not sit at a table filled with dishes and let everything go cold. Its not out of the ordinary to order sever times and just order small items. So we got our second menu and ordered the usual rolls. Dynamite, which came with no shrimp this time for some reason. The spicy crab, which came out as the regular crab, the spicy salmon which came out fine actually... 
and then the wait for the bill. We asked for the bill.... didnt come.. people came in and ordered taked out.. still didnt come... went up to the cash and waited...   It got to the point where i had to tap the guy on the shoulder and ask to pay...
Terrible service... Menu is constantly loosing items.. and is now over priced for what is offered... too bad.... I used to go almost every week.. Looks like we will find a new place to patronize..."}
{"text":"absolute worse sushi place to go to... dont believe me?  go there and try the food..
if you have tried any uptown sushi buffets, prepared to be disgusted.

i have never tasted more bland food in my life... for 17 dollars ayce you really feel you wasted your money.  first off, the selection is the weakest AYCE sushi selection ever (see pic if you dont believe).  BTW no dessert as well. 

No seaweed salad was a big upset for me.  they basically only have the cheapest things on the menu + salmon sashimi... everything else is a joke.

the chicken wing was by far the worse chicken wing i have ever tasted in my life... it was like someone took a rotten chicken wing and threw it into flour then into the deep fryer.. no seasoning, no salt.  Not even a granule of anything... presentation was disappointing. 

definitely no one is tasting anything and the owners have given up.  either that or no one purchased salt or any seasoning including black pepper in the last 3 years there.  

pretty much any cooked food you order will come out looking the same, tasteless, bland and just plain bad.  The tempura was a big fail, the sauce they used.. literally tasted like water.  They watered it down so bad it tasted like it had a ratio of 1 teaspoon soy sauce to 1 gallon of water.  i mean u cant even smell the flavor.. it was literally light brown water.

the service was slow (2 waitress/ no more than 6 tables)... i wanted to show a time lapse of a paper i accidentally dropped in the dead centre of the walk way and how 15 mins later, no one even picked it up.  If you look around you see 4 out of 6 tables are looking for a waitress.. and nowhere to be found.  

Edamame beans took 2 orders and 1 hour to come out...  ONLY saving grace if any was that they have salmon sashimi.  

wont be coming back for sure..."}
