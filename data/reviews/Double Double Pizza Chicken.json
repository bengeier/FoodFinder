{"text":"I usually order the double decker deal. Delivery is fast, sometimes arriving in 20 minutes and the pizzas are delicious."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE services. Waited 2 hours for a pizza delivery and their shop was only 7 mins away from my house! Called customer service and THEY DID NOTHING FOR US. Had to feed a hungry family and they said the pizza was coming, the driver just got lost. We said we did not want cold pizza, and all they did was insist that the driver was on their way and we had to pay full price. We did not end up getting out food as we were fed up and WE WILL NEVER BE ORDERING FROM HERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Whatever you do when you feel like having wings? DO NOT ORDER WINGS FROM THIS PLACE. Went in on Friday with my family. The manager/owner was rude abrupt and dirty looking. The place is dirty with dirty seating dirty floors, the whole experience was gross. The staff did not wear gloves when cooking the food no hair nets nothing! When we got our wings they were terribly disappointing. They were dried up and had obviously been sitting out for who knows how long.  There was barely any meat on the bone the sauce was basic and nothing to write home about. Total waste of money. I suppose you now know where NOT to order chicken wings!"}
{"text":"Though I have not tried their Pizza or Wings, this review is only based on their Shawarma Wraps:

I was running short on time as I was heading to work... I saw a sign which offered a 2 shawarma wraps for $7.99. As I went inside, one of the first things I noticed was that the store was empty (no customers)... and veggies seemed stale, and meat seemed dry...though I crossed my fingers hoping it would turn out okay... 

The gentlemen who was making my shawarma had zero (no/nadaaaa/not even a bit) of a clue on how to fill in or wrap the shawarma... the thing was coming apart as he was making it...

Another gentlemen behind him was cleaning the counters with a piece of cloth and instantly came this way, opened up the fridge beneath the veggies and opened up an old container... stuck his bare hands in and grabbed a bunch of lettuce and threw it onto the salad table... disgusted. 

Shawarma wraps are advertised as 2 for $7.99... but was charged about $10, I asked why and to my surprise he said 'chicken only special'... I had ordered one beef and one chicken and he charged me about $6 just for the beef wrap. 

Anyhow, I went to my car tried to eat as much of it as I could (ate only about 30% of each shawarma as ths rest seemed to just fall on the floor...)... the pita was stale and had a weird smell to it.... there was also a weird stench coming from inside the wrap.. I tried to pick out and eat each veggie one at a time to try and identify what it was and it was both the lettuce and tomatoes which had an awful smell... 

Its been a couple hours since i've eatten it and I can definitely say I will never be returning even if I starve and have no choices... stomach feels bad right now... 

BE AWARE, STAY AWAY FROM THE SHAWARMAS!!! Just head down to warden and lawrence area and indulge in one of the many shawarma joints offered there.... this one was bad.... real bad... sadly one star is being too nice here."}

{"text":"I will preface this by saying that this store used to be good.  Unfortunately it appears that something has drastically changed with them.  We attempted to order online for delivery at 8 pm on a Thursday night.  We got an error saying the store was closed (even though the hours showed it open until 11pm).  We called customer service and were told that the store itself was open but was not delivering due to inclement weather.  We accepted it as there was a snow storm going on and wound up not ordering.  The next night (tonight - Friday) we thought we would try again, this time we got the same error (It said delivery should be open until 12 and we were ordering at 11:15).  So we called customer service again, and were told that the store was open and delivering but they just forgot to change some setting on their side so we could order through them.  We needed a couple of minutes to get our order together so they said to call back.  We did and got a hold of Nitish who said that Double Double had changed the delivery areas for the winter and now we were is a zone where there was no store that would deliver to us (we are in the middle of Don Mills so we are not talking a remote location).  He then said he would call the store manager who would call us back within a couple of minutes and deliver as an exception.  We waited about 15 minutes and, surprise surprise, no phone call.  We called BACK in and happened to get the same person (Nitish) again, and now we got a 4th story (changed from his previous one) .  He now claimed that the manager himself was out on delivery, he was the only delivery driver and he didn't want to bother delivering to us as we were too far away (remember that they have delivered to us no problem for years), and that tough luck, nothing could be done. He also called the next closest store who also refused to deliver (although I don't blame them for that as they are not the store that would normally deliver.) 

Obviously this store and it's manager (who refused to give his name) feel that poor customer service and refusal of service because they can't be bothered is a proper way that a business should be run.  If a manager is willing to slack off on things like this, I shudder to think what corners they would be cutting in store and to product quality/safety."}
{"text":"My experience is limited their potato wedges and their fries.

The wedges were cold first of all and pretty flavourless...

So why the \"A-OK\" rating? The fries were pretty great. They weren't freshly made or anything, but they had a satisfyingly thick cut, and they weren't overly oily. And of course to have a great fry it has to be crispy, and these were hell-a crispy.

I'd say come here for that guilty snack, but not much else."}
{"text":"Great deals on fried chicken and potatoe wedges! The wedges are moist and crispy. You cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Double double has some great fries, but unfortunately the wait times are absolutely absurd! Also, I highly recommend not coming during lunch times on weekdays, as there is a high school nearby and it it flooded with bratty, 14-18 year old kids! They make the experience even worse! Especially when some tall, Caucasian, emo, green/blue eyed girl is there. She's just so frustrating! Like, stop complaining about some girls boyfriend and some triplets like just fight them omfg."}
{"text":"Just your standard chicken and pizza place. Nothing really special about the place but it isn't all that bad. I've never actually been to this location, but my cousin brought it back for dinner one night and said they used to be better but have gradually slipped downhill. 

Ordered up 6 piece chicken meal with wedges. The chicken is very lightly battered to the point where you think there might not be any batter at all. Some people might actually like it, but being the fat asses most people are (at least those looking for places like these), you kind of want some batter right? Best part for some in regards to fried chicken. Nonetheless, the meat was a tad dry but tasted fine. Wedges are giant blocks of potato. No real seasoning for them wedges, so they weren't great.

The prices are decent enough and they do have some nice specials. If you're looking for a quick meal, you can try this place, but there are much better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"About wings: small, dry, tasteless, taste like they've been frozen for months

About my experience:
Called to complain about the wings, said I wanted a credit for next time or something else.

Not possible. Agent says I'm either getting replacement wings or nothing.

I get replacement wings. Same horrible quality. Driver comes to pick up the previous wings, opens the box in front of me, counts them. Of course they're all there. Never seen such bad manners in my life.

Called back, said I still hate the wings, you can have them back. Agent says that was all they can do. No credit. No refund. Attitude of \"now they're your wings, your problem\"

Threw out the wings. Attached is a pic of them in the garbage, where they belong."}
{"text":"I wouldn't be surprised if this place started charging customers for every mushroom piece they put on a pizza. 

Horrible service. Horrible food. I'm ashamed to say I've had food from here.

Believe me when I say a 1 star rating is very generous of me."}
{"text":"Love this location as they make the BEST Wing Machine wings and have the friendliest service. 

They've renovated it to add new seating, tvs, ice cream, slushies and the same great food!!

Can't wait for my wings to be ready (drool)"}
