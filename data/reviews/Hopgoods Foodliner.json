{"text":"Love this spot. Watched a video on Vice and they did a little segment on this restauraunt so thought I'd go check it out. The ambiance in this place is amazing, lighting, music and decor are all on point. I reserved a table online the same night with extreme ease. Ordered some bread to start which was good and had the king snow crab legs and the octupus. Both were fantastic especially the crab legs. Finished off with the Halifax donairs which were absolutely wonderful. I highly recoomend this spot if you arein the junction and looking for a classey place to eat and splurge"}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary dinner and it was a flawless meal and a great overall experience, I havent been this enthusiastic about dinner out in a while.  We had 4 dishes, 1 dessert,  2 cocktails, 1 beer and 1 glass of wine and it came to $111 + tip.

The host was very friendly and the server was attentive.  We had the smoked mackerel, donairs, crab dip and triscuits and the shrimp and grits.  Everything was incredibly flavourful.  The only downside was the size of my cocktail which was micro-mini and a steep $13.  If it was just a touch bigger I wouldn't have a single negative thing to say.  That small criticism aside, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were really excited to check this place out but the overall experience was a big disappointment. 

The night started out badly when we arrived at 6 pm for our 6 pm reservation. The restaurant's door and windows were open but when we walked in we were greeted by a snarky hostess who snarled \"We aren't open yet!\" 

When we pointed out that the door was open and that we were there for our 6 pm reservation (and that it was in fact 6 pm - we both looked at our phones) she said that they would open in 5 minutes. We said that was fine and asked if we could just grab a seat. She said no and told us to leave and come back in 4 minutes since it was \"restaurant policy\". 

We left, stood on the street corner and then watched, astonished, as two tables come in and be seated in the next few moments. 

I have no problem with the restaurant's policy but then please don't open the front door until yore ,ready, stop taking 6pm reservations and certainly don't seat others if you've told us we can't have a table for another 4 minutes. More than anything, her snotty attitude was incredibly off-putting. Had she been pleasant I don't think we would have thought twice. 

I will say that the space is quite nice. I enjoyed the decor and it had a nice vibe. Our server was excellent - pleasant and knew the menu very well. He made great suggestions. 

Food-wise the donairs were absolutely delicious. Tasty and well seasoned. However, the crab dip was just ok and my meal - the fried chicken, grits and bacon sauce - wasn't very good. The grits were delicious but the chicken had little flavour. I was seriously underwhelmed and left half of it on the plate. My friend had the scallops and said they were ok but nothing special. 

At the end of the night we were told that their credit card machine wasn't working so I had to make a 15 minute trek up Roncesvalles and back to get cash. Not anyone's fault but it certainly meant that the experience was bookended by bad moments and the food in the middle (with the exception of the donair) wasn't enough to pardon these gaffes.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience at Hopgood's.  I'm not sure why people are complaining about portion sizes because I found them to be right for the price point and for food of this calibre. We had two apps, two mains, and shared a dessert and a bottle of wine.  It was the perfect amount of food and came to about $150.  

We started with the donairs which were DELICIOUS.  I can't speak to authenticity or Haligonism, or whatever. Who cares. They were DELICIOUS.  The sweetness from the evaporated milk was unexpected and interesting.  We also had the mackerel with creme fraiche on an oat cracker (I think...).  I'll spare you the holy mackerel joke.  It was perfect. 

The quarter chicken (a roulade of chicken breast wrapped in chicken thigh, deep fried and sliced) came on a pillow of cheesy grits and was topped with a delicately sliced fried kale. Bacon. Jus. BACON. JUS.  Was amazing.  We had the scallops for our second main and it was tender and flavourful.  The potato croquettes were a crispy, naughty, delight. 

We had the chocolate toffee bar for dessert, which came adorably wrapped in brown craft paper and tied up with string.  Definitely one of a few of my favourite things. 

I only have one minor complaint. They don't have coffee.  Really guys?  Hide a Nespresso machine in the kitchen. It's worth the small investment. No one has to know it isn't one of those gigantic fancy bartop espresso machines.  Having coffee is just one of the basics.

I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Hopgoods. The servers really know the food items and talk through all options with appropriate wine selections. I had the tartare, which was a generous portion and really really delicious. 

The wine was great, albeit skewed a little pricey. We arrived at 6:30pm on a Friday and felt a little rushed, as it seemed everyone was aware there would be someone else coming in for our table soon. 

That said, the food is really high quality, interesting and the restaurant has a great casual vibe. Go, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great brunch menu on Sundays, love it lasts till 3 pm. Mimosas are made with fresh squeezed oranges and good amount of bubbles. At the non- alcoholic corner, ginger- pear drink is refreshingly delicious. 

On the downside, they have a wifi network but do not share it with the customers."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Hopgood's About a month ago. I was intrigued by the reviews of their menu being focused on childhood favorites from the Maritimes! 

The menu did not disappoint, they serve a lot of very unique dishes, some of which did remind of me back home, but others were not so familiar - guess growing up in a Chinese household didn't really expose me to a lot of the traditional food from the Maritimes - ha ha. 

The Halifax donairs were as good as in NB and NS, The crab dip served with triscuits was great, and the scallops and crispy pork shoulder was really tasty but small in serving size. 

The wine is great but the prices are a little high. Worth a try at least once..."}
{"text":"This place has amazing, carefully thought out food. Not cheap but worth it! Staff are courteous, attentive and informative. Outstanding. I will be back as soon as I can."}
{"text":"Read good reviews about this place and decided to venture out from the east end to check it out. Service started out great considering we made dinner reservations for 7pm and didn't end up there until 8 (thank you Lake Shore Blvd) and they still had a table waiting for us. The staff were friendly and helpful throughout the meal. The restaurant is dimly lit and the space is compact. But I guess that's what it takes to create the \"mood\" of a trendy chic atmosphere. We started with  1/2 oysters followed with their much talked about Halifax Donairs (yes, they are as good as people say). We also ordered Digby scallops and crispy calamari with little fried zucchini balls. Everything we ate was a hit but don't expect to get full ordering just a couple of dishes. I'm a petite girl and I came out of there wanting to eat a pizza. This is definitely a good place to order a few drinks and have a light meal. Overall, great experience all around."}
{"text":"Nice food, some of it a little gimmicky. Didn't feel super warm and friendly but staff were decent. Obviously someone put a lot of care into the wine list."}
{"text":"Food here is really good however I will say this is not a place if you're looking for value. 
Portions are very small and prices are a little pricey. The quality is there though. 
As others were saying, the donairs are really good! Definitely order those if you haven't tried them."}
{"text":"Service, just like in the Maritimes, was incredibly friendly and enthusiastic.  Our server was eager to make drink suggestions, help up navigate the menu, and reinforce our choices.  But unfortunately, also like the East Coast, service was also a little too laid back (aka. slow and semi-inattentive).  We are the type who order our food and drinks within moments of being sat.  We don't doddle after dessert.  So we tend to get a bit impatient when we feel courses and food are taking longer then necessary.  Case in point: We were sat at 8 PM. We ordered at 8:15. We got our first \"round\" (2 dishes) at 9 PM. Our next \"round\" at 9:30. Our third \"round\" at 9:45- at this time I decided I would just order the desserts now and let them know we were in a bit of a rush if possible.  Despite the rush warning, we didn't receive our desserts for another 1/2 hour (10:15). I get that like Edulis (which I also found pretty slow), that perhaps a long, lazy service is part of the experience they're trying to create, but it just was a bit annoying when I knew that most of what we were waiting for was raw bar/pre-prepped/ quick-cook (i.e. crab dip, donairs, chocolate bar, surf and turf, snow crab).
The drink menu was innovative, diverse and intising.  We tried the Kentucky Cookie (Lazzaroni amaretto, bourbon, lemon, egg white, simple syrup), the Black Manhattan (Bulleit bourbon, averna amaro, bitters), and the Rosemary Paloma (Reposado tequila, lime, rosemary syrup, Ting grapefruit soda, Maldon salt).  The Kentucky was strong but very sweet- one of those drinks that slip down way too easily. At the other end of the flavour spectrum, the Manhattan was a heavy hitter with a bitter edge- exactly how my partner likes it. For me, the Paloma was a little heavy on the salt (it definitely overwhelmed my palate which masked the delicate notes of the rosemary), but I liked the use of the grapefruit.


The food menu at HF is what I would call \"continuous\". That is, there isn't a strict divide between the first and second courses (hell, some people might even consider the donairs a dessert!) I definitely like this style of eating because it encourages sharing and exploration and is almost a little rebellious.
We tried:

 
Hot Crab Dip and Triscuits
 
Totally addictive. The dip had lots of delicate crab flavour, and a substantial meaty texture, and I loved how the sweetness of the crab balanced out with the saltiness of the triscuit crackers.

 
Halifax Donairs

One of the most delicious things to ever grace my lips. The pillowy soft house-made pita was overflowing with perfectly seasoned meat that while tender had that typical hearty texture of meat cooked on a vertical spit.  Slathered in an addictive sweet-garlic sauce based on sweetened condensed milk, I was licking my fingers to relive the messy taste experience for the rest of the night.

Surf and Turf (Lobster and Beef Tendon)

I loved the sweet, moist lobster against the crunch of the fried tendon.  The pickles lent an mild salty sweet note, and the Marie Rose sauce (essentially a British mixture of ketchup and mayo) brought the luscious creamy tangy element.  We were both expecting a much more substantial dish, but actually appreciated the dainty portion.

Crispy Ham Hock and Sauerkraut
This dish was totally my style.  The ham hock \"cake\" reminded me of a swiney version of a fish cake, only with bigger, bolder savoury flavours and a denser consistency.  The interior of the \"cake\" had a texture somewhere between pulled pork and chorizo, juicy and sumptuously fatty, while the exterior was as crispy as a panini-pressed grilled cheese (with extra butter).  The portion was appropriate and balanced out with a lovely tangy potato salad, and a briney bed of sauerkraut.

Cape Breton Snow Crab
This is a must order. We eat a LOT of seafood every year in Florida, but these were probably some of the best snow crab we have ever tasted. It was a half crab, with lots of meat on board, and I'm grateful the chef took the time to help us out with the shelling (last New Years Eve I cut myself pretty badly on a crab shell and bled for most of the night- not hot).

Molasses Bread
The bread that accompanied the crab was dense with a nice sweet aroma.  

Crispy Toffee
Served like an old school home-made treat, this was NOT your typical chocolate bar.  A base of blended Rice Krispies cereal is mixed with decadent white chocolate and then topped with sweet toffee candy.  It's then coated in chocolate, ad sprinkled with a little maldon sea salt for that sweet and salty combination.  The result is a perfect sized treat to end the meal that hits all of the pleasure buttons.  Next Halloween, I will be trekking all of the way out to Roncesvales to pick up a few of these..."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!

Unlike many of the new trendy restaurants popping up around the city, Hopgood's takes reservations... so take advantage of this! They were busy the entire evening I was there and they turned down countless parties.

What went into my belly:

Halifax Donairs ($14) - which consisted of juicy sliced beef and pork served on soft, fluffy flatbread. It came with two donairs served on top of a brown paper bag which gave it that street food feel. The meat was nicely seasoned and topped with onions, tomatoes and a sweet white sauce made from evaporated milk. I can't comment on the authenticity of these donairs but they were incredible! Incredibly messy too...

Lamb Heart Tartare ($16) - the tartare itself was packed full of flavour and wasn't too gamey. It was served with a side of cauliflower and olive puree, both of which added another great layer of flavours. I have to mention the generous portion of caramelized cream which was also served on the side of this dish. The server explained to us that heavy cream is cooked down until it's caramelized. It's then dried and shaved prior to being served.  So, how did it taste? I really enjoyed it but I'm having trouble coming up with a description of how it tasted. Perhaps like sweet cheese? 

Smoked Mackerel on Oatcakes ($10) - I really enjoyed the smoked mackerel which was moist and not too salty. Be careful eating this though as the oatcakes were very crumbly. 

Quarter Chicken with grits and bacon sauce ($26) - The chicken consisted of a boneless breast wrapped around a chicken thigh. Even though the dish contained chicken breast, it was wonderfully moist as it was cooked sous-vide. After being cooked, it was deep-fried to give it a nice crisp exterior. Highly recommended!

Crispy Toffee ($8) - This home-made chocolate bar is made from rice krispies, toffee, white chocolate and sprayed with milk chocolate. At $8, it was a little steep for a chocolate bar but I can assure you, it was well worth it!

A fantastic meal at Hopgood's. Worth the hype!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, getting a reservation for four was quite easy (which should have been a sign...). I had high hopes, given how much I have heard about this place. 

The restaurant itself is quite small, with two to three tables that seat 4-6, a few tables that seat 2 and then some seats around the bar. The restaurant is dim, with candles on each table giving a romantic atmosphere. 

As soon as we were seated we were presented with the menu and evening specials, and had our cups filled with water. We had dietary restrictions and the server was very helpful and prompt at identifying dishes that we can have. 

We had the following:
- Lobster Roll: tastes good but too small, I liked the pickle on top and chips inside. Wish there were more pickles
- Tuna Crudo: nothing special, was ok
- Guni Dumplings: they taste ok, missing some seasoning
- King Crab: very fresh and lovely
- Crunchy Toffee: delicious but very rich

My biggest issue is the pricing of each dish, it's is out of wack. If you are charging $3-5 per bite, it better look good, smell good and taste good!"}
{"text":"For those who enjoy a cocktail or two.. Beware: Liquor license ends at 11pm. We made a reservation for 9:30pm and like to take our time with things.. We were told before our main course even arrived that we would have to place our final drink order as the bar would be  closing. We were also asked to make any other food (dessert) orders at that time. No sooner than  my fork hit the table was my plate cleared and the bill presented. Nothing like dropping $350 (4 guests) and being rushed out. Food was tasty: oysters were expertly shucked, smoked mackerel had a nice flavour but the oatmeal cracker was a little sweet and cocktails were very well made... Just wish we could have had another before it was time for us to leave."}
{"text":"Excellent take on Nova Scotian delicacies, complete with a NS donair on the menu. Great service  and friendly staff. Will head there again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend is vegetarian and she had practically no choices as any substitutions are \"politely declined\" as  stated on their menu. Pretty much her only choice was the asparagus soup. I was very hungry and asked the server about the smoked sausage. She said that it was quite a substantial amount of food and that it's typically a plate to be shared. And I'd probably need to take some home at the end...sounded great but when it arrived the portion was less than an 6oz steak would have been (for $22 +tax)... And with nothing as sides unless I count the 4 tiny pieces on mushrooms on top. I can't deny that it was indeed very tasty but I left that place hungry and after being mislead I didn't really feel like spending more money there in just filling up."}
{"text":"Hopgoods delivers on fine & trendy dining east coast style. I tried the staples, crab dip, donairs, crunchy toffee, and wife had surf & turf tartare, all which was top notch flavour, and impeccable presentation. Service was spot on, good explanation of each dish and quick service. We managed to get in to the restaurant without a reservation before 7PM but that was a fluke. Definitely make a reservation so that you arent unexpectedly let down without a seat!"}
{"text":"Service/Atmosphere

Between unfriendly but highly professional service and unprofessional but friendly service, I'm torn.  I'd like it somewhere in between.  But if it hits the important stuff -getting us drinks and food, I'd trade nitpicky stuff in exchange for friendliness.  And I don't mean friendliness in the American chain restaurant sense of overstepping personal space, but being genuinely nice and wanting to make my evening pleasant.

Hopgood's service had some nitpicky missteps (when to clear or not clear plates, some order confusion, etc.), but it hit the big picture stuff just fine (knowledge of the menu, etc.).  And the service here is extremely friendly.  

I will digress here, but no one at Hopgood would dream of the horror of horrors, interrupting guests mid-sentence to say, \"excuse me... how is everything?\"  Fine, until you interrupted me mid-sentence...  I would accept the following, \"excuse me...

a. there's been a radiation leak at the plant next door;
b. is that someone's car on fire outside?;
c. was that Elvis?;
d. is Ebola really contagious?;
e. is anyone here a cardiologist, a midwife, know how to diffuse a bomb?\"

So none of those pet peaves, genuinely nice service.  The décor and atmosphere were generally like the service - gemutlich, cool and inviting.

Food

I'll start with the conclusion, I thought the food was good with the odd bit of very good.  The theme is Halifax/maritimes, which is a bold theme in a city far from the ocean.  The night I was there the menu was devoid of fresh fish, which I don't fault since I respect chefs that let the quality of available ingredients determine their menu.  If you can't get great fresh fish one day, don't serve it - even if it is your theme.  I'd like to return when they do have fresh fish.  They seem pretty good at editing dishes (borderline too good) but that less-is-more ethos (I think) plays well to fresh fish, which I often find is overly accessorised and adorned.

I had the following: buttered cabbage and crispy mushrooms, pork shoulder and artichoke, cured artic chart and potatoes remoulade, and a donair.

The char was the highlight.  I've cured salmon and wahoo before.  It's easy to do but tough to get the cure just right so that the flavour of the cure doesn't overwhelm the fish.  They nailed it.  The potatoes remoulade were ultra thin potato strands deep fried to crunchy perfection - a perfect textural balance to the fish.  As good as it was, I thought it was missing something to put it in the realm of great.

I had a similar opinion of the pork shoulder.  This was cured and smoked shoulder thinly sliced like a German speck.  The idea was good and it was smoked to perfection - I'm not sure how they smoked it, but the flavour was great.  But I didn't find it the ideal compliment with the artichoke and a slightly sweet creamy sauce.  It came off a bit cloying.  It needed some acidic balance.  There were five of us, and we didn't finish it, nuff said.

I was excited about the buttered cabbage mostly because I respect the ballsy move of letting a dish like that stand alone.  It was good but not great - a bit of a sloppy texture and missing something again.  No one disliked it, but...

On to the donair.  For those who don't know it, it's like a gyros or a shawarma with thinly shaved street meat (pork and beef) on pita bread.  I'm told it's Halifax stoner food, like kebabs in London and hot dogs in Toronto.  I can see how it fits with the geographical theme, but it was a bit lost otherwise with the rest of the menu.  I found the sauce overly sweet and creamy.  It landed with a thud rather than a ping.

All in all, I found the food good, with some very good, but not great.  The atmosphere was ultra cool, casual, and very friendly.  I would definitely go back for the atmosphere and the food was good enough to give it a second try."}
{"text":"East Coast inspired through and through from the food all the way down to the Maritime hospitality!

My friends and I arrived after another reservation got cancelled due to power outage.  At first glance, it could have turned into a \"no room at the inn\" situation.  As luck would have it, their private dining room was free for the time being and the manager offered it to us.  WINNER!

The server was so nice and personable, I almost asked him to join us!  This restaurant is tapas style, so we ordered a bunch of sharing plates.  Each bite was  so delicious and different from the last.  It was a delicious culinary adventure... in my mouth. ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to Hopgood's twice now. The service was great. The menu is simple looks to have been updated slightly the second time - the wings were great. I'm usually not big on appetizers or desserts but the way the menu and portions are setup I ended up doing both plus a main each time."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE WELCOME - DECENT FOOD
Nice food, great server, which was good, because our initial impression was less than desirable...... 

We arrived at five to six on Sunday night and walked in, only to be told they were still setting up and not open until six and that we would have to leave until then. I pointed out that it was cold outside and asked if we could just sit quietly but he refused, saying they would open in 10 minutes. I checked my phone and said, actually 5 minutes. He checked his watch and said, actually, 11 minutes. So we had to leave and stand outside in the cold while he locked the door behind us. It was a birthday treat for my daughter and this left a very bad impression for all of us.  

Once we were invited back in we had a good meal made better by a really excellent server, who more than made up for the icy welcome. 

Fun food, great for sharing and not bad value - $235 plus tip for 5 including a $55 bottle of wine. Good donairs, Surf and turf tartare a bit pricey at $20. Fried Chicken delicious (although again a bit pricey compared to say, the Stockyards - $25 vs $14). Crispy Toffee - amazing. 

Would I come back? Probably not. There are so many other good places to try and that welcome still leaves a sour taste that I won't forget anytime soon.

Just checked below and found someone else had exactly the same experience. Maybe they need to review the policy."}
{"text":"Absolutely extraordinary! Food and service were out of this world! We were there to celebrate my birthday and it was such a perfect atmosphere. The seafood tower is so fresh and makes a great app for 4 people. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hook, Line and Sinker!

I'm ECSTATICALLY  happy that the newwest addition to the Roncey neighborhood is Hopgood's Foodliner.  

Interestingly, The naming of this restaurant, pays homage to the owners Grandfather's local grocery store! You can see the real store hanging in a photo box above the bar!

Upon entering the resto, I was immediately impressed at how different the place looked with its updated charcoal walls and industrial touches.  The aesthetics certainly transformed the space into an unpretentious yet chic dining atmosphere.  Minimal decor provided a canvas for the smattering of guests which ranged in age (not really a kidsplace for evening dining however). I have to note that in addition to the visual aesthetics, I caught myself LOVING the kickass tunes that were blaring.  Good variation from Eazy-E to the Chromatics to Grateful Dead!

Greeted with a tailored menu scrawled on the wall (and additionally on a simple printed menu), I was certainly happy that the menu was small as I had some MAJOR decisions to make.  Before I could decide on an app, I chose to look at their beverage menu- and I have to say that I was IMPRESSED!  As a beer gal, I was blown away that they carried a small but varied range of beers.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I noticed that they had an entire Beau's growler on the menu! Such an awesome idea, and definitely the first place in Toronto where I had seen this beauty on the bevy menu!

I chose to start with the Halifax Donairs, which arrived placed on a crumpled paper bag and were ever so delicious.  I certainly would reccomend these to try, as they encorporate the East Coast flavour into this restaurant.  For my main, I chose the crispy pork shoulder with scallops.  Just typing this, makes my mouth water.  The pork was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, and the scallops were cooked to perfection.  Additionally, blackened broccoli sat underneath the meat and seafood combination.  It was a flavour trifecta that very much appealed to my tastebuds!

Although, not really a vegetarian friendly, this menu provides very interesting meat and seafood selections.  The cocktails are unique and streamlined in addition to the amazing beer selections.

The staff really are focused on great, unpretentious service and really do genuinely feed the hype of this place.  They love what they do!

I very much enjoyed that the staff never rushed my dining experience, because I loved every minute of it.  I find that this is a very common Toronto dining flaw, the rush for table real estate! If you are worried about a wait or getting a table, I suggest that you call ahead for reservations.

I most certainly know that I will be back to Hopgood's Foodliner with some good friends so we can get into some of those donairs and growlers! It's just that kind of amazing place that can combine a laid back and fun atmosphere. YOU should try it too!"}
{"text":"The menu is rather limited, but still has a lot of great items.   The wine list wasn't huge, but had good entries, and they also do a number of unique cocktails.  

My friend and I shared a few things:  buttered cabbage with fried mushrooms was fantastic; the crab legs were magnificent tasting, well-presented, and came with white vinegar in addition to melted butter, for a real maritime touch; the brussel sprout caesar salad was very salty, and the only thing that wasn't great (I thought it was OK, but my friend thought it was a few notches below OK).  

The service was very attentive and helpful.  I'm a red wine drinker and usually avoid whites, which isn't the best way to eat seafood I know.  The waiter gave me a few samples of different whites to find one I liked that would also compliment the food (yes, I am enough of a heathen to suck down red wine while eating crab legs!)    We had some questions about various ingredients, and the waiters were very knowledgeable. 

We lingered and chatted for a quite while after finishing our meal and paying, and the waiter came by and refilled our water glasses twice, even after we'd settled the bill (a very nice touch I think).  

The name is a bit odd, and for me is a bugger to remember (more than once I called it the \"Realgood Highliner\"), but it gets funnier (and even more difficult to remember!) after a few glasses of wine!  They also do a variety of cocktails that looked very good, but we didn't sample.  Ditto for the desserts.  But, I'll definitely be back so I'll be sure to try them then!"}
{"text":"We went last night (Sunday) and had a great time! My friend had no problems making a reservations for a party of 6 one week in advance. The reservations were available on time, and was greeted warmly. It was my birthday, and they made the effort to wish me a happy birthday with a complimentary glass of sparkling wine. The atmosphere was relaxed, casual, and easy-going. The service was good, but in total, we spent around 3 hours dining, which included drinks, apps, mains, and cake-cutting. The cocktails were on the expensive side 15-18 each, and my Nouveau Mot was quite small for it costing $16.

Now, the most important part, the FOOD: 
Appetizers:
Donair Poutine - BEST APP WE HAD. It is a special and not always available, but this is a must! It's on the sweet-savory side. 
Pickle Plate - Simple, delicious, consisted of carrots, beets, onions, and cauliflower...surprisingly, no pickles! 
Smoked Mackerel on Oatcakes - Mackerel was delicious, but if you don't LOVE cream cheese, this is not your app.  My friends and I thought that the massive amount of cream cheese overpowered the delicious mackerel.
Snow Crab Legs - 

Mains:
Octo., Treviso, Garlic & Meyer Lemon - PERFECTLY COOKED. The Meyer Lemon sauce is exquisite. The cloves of garlic was not my favorite though. 
Puff Daddy & Notorious P.I.G. - On a light puff pastry lays a mix of foie gras and pig blood sausage, topped with grated green apples. This dish had a creative name, screamed to us as we grew up in the 90's and 2000's. However, the dish was a bit too sweet for us, felt a bit mushy, which I guess should be expected with foie gras and blood sausage. 
Cape Breton Snow Crab - Delicious, fresh, but there really wasn't enough on the plate to call this a main. The sweet bread that accompanied the crab was fresh and different. 
Whole Roasted N.S. Lobster with Hazelnut butter - Very well-cooked, and fresh. It was quite expensive, and nothing extraordinary. 
Albacore Tuna & Preserved Tomato - This cold dish had excellent flavors, filled with tomato accents, but on the sweet side, as opposed to the usually tartness you would expect from a tomato dish. 

We, unfortunately, did not get to try the much raved-about crispy toffee as my friend brought a cake for us to enjoy. We brought our own candles and lighter as well, not sure if they had that available. However, there is a plating fee of $20 for the cake. We couldn't finish it, so we told the crew to enjoy it as a treat from us. 

There is a private wine cellar-looking room, that had bar seats for private dining - perfect for a small gathering.  Overall, I would go back for apps, share selective mains, and grab a beer."}
{"text":"Good service and good food. The portions though are on the small side. Halifax Donairs was a tad on the spicy side as many reviewers have warned. The Crispy Toffee though delicious tasted like a Twix bar that somebody decided to charge $8 for. If I lived in the neighbourhood I can see myself dropping in again when their menu changes."}
{"text":"It is not often that I will go this far west, but now I definitely have reason to.  Hopgoods specialty is local, tapas-style, east-coast food.

We started the night with oysters then followed it up with the artic char and the chowder.  Afterwards we had foie gras terrine, the lobster bisque braised chicken and the mud pie for dessert.  Everything was really solid, with the definite highlights being the chowder and the oysters.  The only downside of all the dishes are the portions, which I only find concerning because of the price-point.

I plan to go back again, overall it was great food, great service...tough on the budget."}
{"text":"The food here is really, really good. The service though... pretty darn bad.

We had a reservation and showed up a bit early. Host says he has an 'even better' table for us in the corner of the back room. I was glad at first because it was much quieter so I wouldn't have to yell conversation over dinner, but it was FREEZING in that spot. There was another open table away from the AC vent that I wanted to switch to, but our waiter didn't come for nearly 10 minutes. It was enough time for that table to be set, given to another couple, and they were poured waters before someone even came by our table. Sure enough, no more tables so essentially we were stuck. 2 bar seats were open, but were promised to a couple guys who were on their way. They got those guys to take our table and we were seated at the bar. Good for not chattering through dinner, but BAD for service. There was only one bartender who also had to wait on 4-5 parties dining at the bar. Again took at least 10 minutes to even get waters. Another 10 until we could order. And when we finished our meal, 20 minutes to get the check. While the restaurant was busy, there were plenty of staff just kind of milling around during all of this. I'm usually not a stickler for attentive service as long as food is good, but I get upset when people who are seated after I am are gone before I get my check!

Luckily I thoroughly enjoyed everything I ate. 
There was a lobster special for the day, and it was bigger than expected. The sauce was amazing! I don't like to adulterate my lobster with anything usually, but this was a winner. It came with the molasses bread which I also loved. Their butter is creamy and a little salty, and complements the bread perfectly. If this doesn't come with your order, get some! Only $2. 
Scallops with tiny sausages were good, maybe a little small (I saw someone's bacon-wrapped scallops and those were much bigger than ours - so Digby beats wild Alaskan?). We finished with the donairs, the perfect late-night food. These were absolutely stuffed with the spicy meat and the sweet sauce on top with the onions/tomatoes worked so well together. It's pretty filling too. 

While service before/after the meal was slow, we did receive our food promptly without having to wait long for the next dish.

Hopgoods had me torn. I'd still recommend it for a tasty meal, just allow some extra time for it! Or maybe just avoid sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"There are really excellent buck a shuck oysters to be had here on Mondays. Oysters and donairs. Yum."}
{"text":"Great Great Great
Creative and pleasant.  The staff truly enjoy what they do.  You can tell by the way they proudly talk about their food, and encourage patrons to try new things."}
{"text":"My husband (a born and raised Nova Scotian) and I had been wanting to come here for months and finally did in mid June 2014 for a date night.   We had crispy pig ears potato salad which my husband couldn't get enough of. We sampled the Molasses bread, which I liked.  We shared the lobster sandwich and lobster pasta and both were delicious.  It was a great meal.  Little did I know at this time that this would end up being our last date night ever.  He suffered a massive heart attack a few days later and passed away.  I would like to thank the lovely waiter who served us.  He was pleasant, charming and funny. My husband enjoyed himself very much and I am left with a great memory of a beautiful meal with the man I will always love.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Came all the way there for buck a shuck on Monday, but they ran out off oysters around 8pm.  Don't do this kind of event, if you don't have enough supply"}
{"text":"First time trying raw oysters and there were so many options of sauces, it was really good!
Love the dishes there, so unique and creative, and all delicious too!
And yes, service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Great food, interesting seasonal cocktails, great service, servers and bar tendenders knew all the food and drink.  Awesome grits and Pimento cheese fritters, not greasy at all and great flavour. Will go again!"}
{"text":"Yes it is pretty hipster so as long as that is what you are expecting (just look at the neighborhood), it's a great little place : \"Fussy\" though well crafted cocktails and small plates. Service was perfect, friendly and fast: great team. It was quiet later in the evening, but a perfect time to go as I could see how this place would feel full quickly. Brussels sprout Caesar really interesting, though pretty rich (the Brussels sprouts really soak up a lot of dressing). Scallops were cooked perfectly and then the desert... oh the desert: brown butter sabayon over banana bread and nutella with some chocolate sorbet... save room. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this unique restaurant in the west end. The menu is quite creative so I was excited to go here, but other than a spectacular seafood selection, this place left much to be desired. I was there with a few others with specific dietary restrictions and while I understand the \"no substitutions\" at the bottom of the menu, we weren't looking to substitute, we were merely looking to omit ONE ingredient from a few dishes and this was met with a clear NO. Unacceptable.

Once it was made clear that we weren't pleased with that, the service went downhill and I was expected to eat my meal with no fork, despite asking for one twice. Happily we shared a fork (yes, that happened). At the end of the meal, we then were held hostage waiting for over 15 minutes after asking for the bill as the wait staff shmoozed and ignored us.

This place has a great vibe, creative cuisine and a lot of potential - unfortunately it's potential is masked by it's pretentiousness and inflexibility to accommodate it's clientele. Oh well."}
{"text":"My chief complaint about this restaurant is that the menu is not very descriptive. The 'asparagus soup', for example, neglects to mention a prawn head, caviar, and sturgeon that come as garnishes. A more egregious omission was with regard to the 'braised beef ribs', which are served with a large puff of greasy beef tendon! On the positive side, the servers are all hugely enthusiastic about good food and take pride in their work."}
{"text":"We went in without a reservation and sat at the bar for an amazing meal and pleasant conversation with the bartender and waitress. There is a reason this place is in the top 10 of a few lists."}
{"text":"We had a group of 4 which allowed us to try a number of dishes.  They were all exceptional or very good.  We especially loved the molasses bread and seafood chowder.  One thing to be aware of is that a couple of the main dishes (like the scallops, which were delicious) have a smaller serving size so you should order a side dish.

I think our server was Ben and he did an amazing job.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It's good, but everything was made so richly.  So, even though the portions are small, the food made us full.

I'm not sure it's worthy of the crazy awesome reviews though.  Good, but expensive.  Because of pricing, it's unlikely we'd go back for ourselves.  If others were to persuade us b/c they've never tried it: for sure.

Our friends had the Spring salad and the vegetarian special, both of which they said were really good.

We had:
Molasses bread: Yum.  Perfect texture.  I don't like most breads, but this, I can eat a lot of.

Nova Scotia Donairs: I had been dying to try these from so many articles read.  Good, but a bit too sweet/rich.  Nice portion size on these though.  Awesome that they serve it on a paper bag!

Lobster Rolls: Nice.  Although I'm more partial to Buster's Sea Cove truck.

Sweetbreads: Good.  Deep fried.  They could've been any mystery meat though, I couldn't tell they were sweetbreads.  Again, the same sweet/rich sauce.

Beer from the mini keg: From Granite Brewery, served in a mason jar.  Hoppy, and nice."}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto and did not have a car - it was worth the cab ride.  The food was innovative, fresh, service was ok....noise level was a little loud.  If I lived in Toronto - it would be on my short list of favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Hopgood based on its reputation and that of the owner/chef. My experience there tonight leaves very little to recommend: food that never rose above good, but which was priced as if it were excellent, with attitude to boot! no tea or coffee offered, because they can't make coffee well (a logic gap which no-one seemed to notice) and being told 1h50 into our sitting without any forewarning that we would be expected to vacate our table in 10 mins time! getting the overpriced bill at that point just felt like adding insult to injury. our waiter who was wonderful was the only thing to recommend about the entire experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday.  We basically ordered the entire menu.  It is a really phenomenal restaurant.  Perfectly cooked, perfectly executed dishes.  The summer salad (and I cannot believe I am about to say this about a damn salad) was one of the best dishes I have ever eaten.  It was perfectly balanced.  The octopus was also particularly well done.  Would 100% return."}
{"text":"It's a good idea to go to this place when someone else is paying because it's a bit pricey ($18 cocktail on the menu) but it's an absolute culinary adventure because how often do you see a restaurant theme based on notoriously bland Maritimes cuisine (cod cheeks anyone?) executed in a mindblowing fashion, including the classic molasses bread and butter (chef's mom's recipe) and the most glorious cauliflower salad creation to ever grace my tongue, which I washed down super classy-like with a few glasses of Sancerre while my favourite chillwave tracks played in the background and I admired the bartender's light saber forearm tattoos, and why yes of course you can make me an $18 cocktail."}
{"text":"I was ready to try Canadian food.......heh!

After recently having  tried Hoof Raw Bar, the time had come for another feast of seafood.  We made a reservation on open table and this place is definitely hoppin'!!! It was packed, but after all, it was Saturday night. We had a seat at the back, which i really liked as it was a bit more brightly lit and cosy.

Our waiter was very knowledgeable. We started out with some cocktails which i highly highly recommend. I loved the \"all inclusive\" and \"the penicillin.\" How can one go wrong with scotch and ginger?  There is no structured menu as the plates are meant to be shared.

Here are some of the highlights:

1. OYSTERS:  My favourites were the glacier bay ones as they tend to have a less brinier finish. 
2. TUNA TARTAR: Great dish. Loved the crunch and jelly. And the radishes. 
3. HALIFAX DONAIRS: Essentially amazing. At first i was confused as i associated donairs with the traditional Turkish ones or Greek gyros...what makes them special to Halifax? Well i was stunned at how good these were.  It all has to do with the sauce--which was sweet. Sweet on a beef donair? YES! Worked so well. Tasted so good. I want a Halifax donair right now. 
4. CRISPY SQUID:  The title is kind of misleading; i would call it sweet and sour squid. It was delicious, topped with potato and zucchini balls. Warning: it is a bit hot. 
5. SCALLOPS WITH CAVIAR AND SHRIMP: Perfectly seared scallops on a bed of crunchy leeks and delicious caviar. Just delicious. 
6. BUTTERSCOTCH BOURBON PUDDING: Need I say more? Chocolate cookie crumbles topped with creme fraiche. So simple. So divine.

Great meal! Hopgoodin good time!"}
{"text":"Whoa. This place.
I'm going to keep this one short & sweet because it doesn't need a lot of fluff.

Great food. 
Great service.
Great atmosphere.

We were a group of 8 out for my sister's birthday and had a reservation for 8:45pm. 2 showed up an hour late - we felt so bad - and not once did we have our waiter or hostess come up to us and ask us a question about where they were or if they could use the table for 2. Little things like that make all the difference.

Food: A limited menu, my preference (don't make me choose!) but we wanted everything on the menu! Unfortunately with a later dinner, a few of the night's specials were already gone.
The great thing is we didn't have to worry about the portions since they adjust the plates for the table size.

We had:
-Oysters
-Bread and butter
-Pickle plate 
-Fried cauliflower & clam sauce *** SO GOOD
-Crispy pig ear and green bean salad
-Sweetbreads
-Cumbrae's Beef & Street Corn Succotash ***insanely delicious!

Drink:
-Goodnight Rose * must have

Service: 
-We had the greatest waitress. She was so sweet and helpful with the menu. We had lots of service constantly clearing our table, refilling our water, without it feeling overbearing. 

Atmosphere:
-A great small, cozy restaurant where you could dress up for a dinner for two or come casual with friends. 

I'll be back, that's for sure. I'm a sucker for amazing service & great food."}
{"text":"I've been told a few times to check out this place in the west end for their East Coast Donair. You mean the \"Overpriced hipster establishment\" I went to tonight?! A fancy version of my Donair for $14. They wanted $16 for a bowl of clam chowder!! What's in it, gold?! Lobster bisque was the special item tonight for $14. I said your soup costs more than the entree?! 

Definitely a once of experience. You're paying for their rent and to say you are at a trendy restaurant. Definitely not a traditional East Coast restaurant. 

AND he kept calling the Donair sauce - Garlic sauce! So I educate him on being an East Coaster. Because the meat is peppered, the Donair sauce is sweet. It's not a garlic sauce. He says: well it has garlic powder in it so there's no difference. I said: you keep saying garlic sauce so I'm expecting garlic sauce. This is a sweet Donair sauce to counter balance the peppered meat. I could hear him talking to the girl at the bar, I guessing hoping to prove me wrong! He was so ignorant and snotty. Not impressed! Proceed with caution. Oh $4 for a mini bottle of Coke!!! The Donair was greasy to boot! (See pics) He lacked customer service. 

I asked for no onions. It arrived with onions. He sees me picking them off and says something. I said: I'm pretty sure I asked for no onions as I'm allergic. Oh I guess I didn't hear you. He walks away. Then he comes back and asks do you want a fresh order. That would be nice so I could enjoy it. Do you want it naked? No, just no onions please. No garlic sauce? No, just no onions. I'm allergic to raw onions, I'll throw them up if I eat them. 

Seriously?! How hard is it to listen to someone when they are speaking? The place was not busy. I will happily go back to my authentic East Coast Donair place in the east end."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious cocktails and good food, depending on what you ordered.

I really wanted to like this place. The atmosphere was relaxed with an upscale feel, the service was excellent and the menu was small and changes often. Unfortunately, there were a few things that put me off. 

We started with cocktails, which were inventive and delicious. No problems there. When the server asked if we had any questions about the menu, I told him that I'm allergic to dairy and if he could tell me what I might be able to eat on the small menu. He told me that the chef really doesn't like to do any substitutions, that he really plans the plating and everything very carefully. He was pretty apologetic about it, and went through the menu with me and stated what I could and could not have. I had been eyeing the lamb heart tartar and he told me that though there is dairy, it's mostly caramelized cream shavings that are sort of on the side, so I could eat most of the dish, but there would be some of the garnish on part of it. I was starving and curious, so I ordered that. When it arrived, I wondered why the chef couldn't just leave it off. Sure, the plate looked gorgeous, but was aesthetics more important than service? I suppose I could have ordered something else, but I'm sort of accustomed to chefs taking on the dairy allergy as a personal challenge to their creativity and doing some really neat stuff on the fly, so I was a bit disappointed. The appetizer it self was quite good, but didn't have that punch of flavour I was hoping for. Maybe that's where the shaved cream came in. The other appetizer we shared, the bbq riblets were really really delicious. 

My main was the sweetbreads in pepper jelly and celery. When it arrived, we were told that it was cooked in a General Tso style, meaning it was heavily breaded and the pepper jelly was eerily similar to the thick, sweet chili sauce you can get in bottles for spring rolls. I was hoping to get my first taste of sweetbreads, but it ended up tasting quite a bit like the sweet, saucy breaded chicken you get at Chinese restaurants in the middle of the night. It was cooked perfectly and not greasy at all, but the breading and sauce were really overpowering. It tasted good, but it was not what i was expecting. My buddy who got the same dish agreed. My other friends got the scallops and another appetizer, the marinated halibut. They oohed and aahed over their beautifully plated and delicious dishes.  

In the end, we all agreed that though it was good, the portions were a bit small for the price and the dishes weren't quite what we expected. A couple of my friends are born and bred Haligonians and they weren't too impressed by the donairs, saying that for the real donair experience in Ontario, we need to head to Milton.

It was a really pleasant meal and a neat spot for original cocktails and good service, but due to the price point in comparison to the food, we probably won't be back again."}
{"text":"Went with a few people for dinner. Ambience was decent. A tad too loud as we couldn't hear the waiter let alone each other over the music, but it was a good playlist so I didn't mind much. Yay 90's hip hop. Food was tasty even though I have dietary restrictions. Scallops and tuna tartare were my favourite dishes. Would go back again."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times and it is consistently amazing! The service is great, the staff is very good at outlining the menu and giving you details on all the dishes being served. The snow crab and oysters are always fresh and delicious. The donairs are an excellent combo of sweet and savoury. The surprise for us the last time we came here were the beef cheeks, this dish was melt in your mouth good, so tender and perfectly cooked! I recommend the toffee crunch bar for dessert, it's simple but is rich in flavour and a perfect end to your meal. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"The service and meal were fantastic from start to finish. 
Donairs, Oysters, Sausage Stew, Chicken stuffed chicken with bacon sauce. 

A Must for everyone is the Crispy TOFFEE. CRAVE for life!"}
{"text":"bring back the monday night fried chicken! 

i'm not a fan of donair - but the flavour is pretty authentic"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good service, and good food. Had the donair, little neck clams, octopus skewers, and smoked mackerel on oatcakes. 

My fav of what we tried was by far the octopus skewers. So tasty!! Also really enjoyed the smoked mackerel which wasn't overly salty. The oatcakes it was on tasted like digestive cookies. Little neck clams tasted really fresh. Wasn't a fan of the donair - found the sauce to be too sweet."}
{"text":"Top notch food & service.  Very original and tasty.  We celebrated a birthday party in their \"party\" room in the back which was a perfect space for a rambunctious get-together - they even have a record player with a milk cart full of some classic albums.  Our party organizer picked a wide assortment of items for us to all share - what a fantastic meal and birthday event!"}
{"text":"Research and menu perusal led me and my friend to Hopgoods, a hop, skip and a jump away from his apartment. We were intrigued by the foie gras poutine (which we couldn't have because the gravy was 'meat-based\" - I know, traditional poutine comes with a beef consomme-based gravy, but this had foie...so I thought poultry based might be a better choice, but I digress).

Disappointment over the poutine's prohibitive ingredients aside, the food was right on the money - delicious pickled vegetables, potato salad with smoked mayo, molasses bread with cultured butter and their smoked chicken croquettes. All tasty.

The service, on the other hand, was a little askew for some reason. We had a reservation and we arrived early, so we asked to sit at the bar until our table opened. We were never told when our table opened up. I mean, sitting at a bar is fun usually, and this was the case here, but it was odd that no one followed up with us on our reservation. We ordered food, and we had to ask for cutlery. We ordered Dieu Du Ciel! Rosée D'Hibiscus, and we received the Le Trou du Diable Saison Du Tracteur instead (we didn't have the heart to send it back because our bartender looked scattered, and the replacement beer was tasty). Everyone was really pleasant when they did interact with us, just disjointed and haphazard.

It's a great spot, with solid food and a \"cool\" atmosphere. And that's all she wrote.

p.s.
SMOKED MAYO."}
{"text":"Having lived in Halifax, I have to say this donair is pretty delicious, but $14? It's a street food y'all. It's hangover food, it's what you get when you are on the run and you have no time to sit down for a meal. It's even served on top of a brown bag. While I admire the attention to the authenticity of this legendary east coat specialty, It's almost as confusing as being served instant ramen and sushi side by side.

One second you are enjoying freshly shucked oysters, the next second you are eating on an oily brown bag. 

All and all, the food was good, and the restaurant is charming as well. Great for seafood lovers or food lovers in general! I'd come back especially for 'buck a shuck' on Mondays."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. Great ambiance. 

I had a seat close to the kitchen, so and was able to watch them working away, which I enjoy. 

The dessert was to die for, and I don't go crazy for desserts. It was a salted toffee chocolate bar type thing - Sooooo good! 

Great service - will return."}
{"text":"We were seated in the back area which was quieter. Started down the menu. Bread, oysters, mackerel, shrimp, donairs, crab dip were all very good. Did not care for the pork rind and fatty ham dish.
Service was very good. Dropped around $275 with a couple of cocktails and a decent bottle of wine."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and met some friends.  Our friends had oysters - I am not a fan so I didn't have any but they seemed to be a hit.  I had a very yummy cocktail - I think it was called Boston Bitters.  We also shared a raw tuna appetizer and it was very good.   For our mains my husband had a octopus and I had the scallops and pork shoulder.  The mains were very good and cooked to perfection but VERY small (around $20-25 a plate).  One of our table mates had the Donairs for an appetizers - we were still hungry after our main course so we ordered some Donairs to share as well ($12 I think).  The donairs were lovely - highly recommend.   The waitress and hostess were very friendly and warm.  I didn't have dessert but our friends said the dessert was very good.
All and all a good night.  I would go back and try some other things from the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and even better service!

We had reservations for a Monday, and it turns out a reservation was definitely a good idea because I didn't see any new people get seated probably until after 8. We ordered a dozen oysters (buck-a-shuck Mondays), blood sausage & egg salad sandwiches, octopus skewers, mussels in a tomato sauce, and scallops in a pesto sauce. Everything was delicious! I think because it was buck-a-shuck, the kitchen seemed pretty slow. We ended up staying at the restaurant for 2.5 hours. For a while, it didn't seem as if anyone's food was coming. However, the waitress came by twice and gave us some molasses bread as well as smoked mackerel on an oat bar, all on the house, as an apology for the wait. I thought that was amazing! I didn't expect her to give us 2 appetizers while we were waiting. My favourite was definitely the octopus skewers.

The service made the wait bearable. The atmosphere is lovely, and we were able to get a seat right by the window. Would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Love the Monday buck a chuck, great atmosphere and mostly pleasant service. The summer menu is not great and some of the side dishes are downright overpriced. I like the fact that you can reserve in advance as you can't at many Roncy restaurants. Overall, not the best food in the hood but nice to go to in the summer for oysters and wine."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Hopgoods foodliner for a friend's birthday. We made reservation for 7:30 and by then, half of the Specials were gone (Octopus salad, hush puppies and Hopgoods deep fried chicken). 

I will have to agree with one of the reviewers with having mixed feelings on the service. Not sure how our servers can be the most professional and the least in the same night. Our waitress was sweet and very knowledgeable on all of the dishes on the menu. What was strange was that another server came and asked us the same info, from our drinks to what is on the menu. Otherwise, our waitress took much longer than we would like to get our orders. 

I don't like scallions and the ribs I wanted has it. Our waitress had to go to the chef to confirm if the sauce for the ribs had scallion. This took 10 minutes before she got back to us and told us that it does. I asked the waitress if they could omit scallions in the  sauce; which she said they couldn't. I then asked if I could order the dish without the sauce or change the sauce... And was told I could do neither. Be warned, the dishes could not be changed, nor altered. All in all it took us 45 minutes before she got all of our orders. 

We ordered Digby Scallop Tartare and Donairs to share. The Scallop Tartare was in a black truffle mayo and honey apple crisp sauce. It wasn't what we expected. We couldn't taste the truffle and there was no honey apple crisp flavour in the tartare. And it had a lot of chives, which wasn't on the menu and the waitress didn't tell us. The mayo sauce made the tartare very creamy. My friends and I agreed that the tartare wasn't worth $20. We also ordered the Donairs, it comes in two and we asked for an extra. I'm a bit disappointed with the Donairs, I've never heard of it before. It seems everyone that did a review on Yelp, raved bout it; one even said it was the best in the city and comparable to the ones out East. We didn't realize that the sauce was EXCEPTIONALLY sweet (as in dessert sweet). The beef was moist, savoury and good but the sauce felt out of place.

For the mains, one of my friends had the Baked Sable fish with brussel sprouts and spicy ndjua. The fish and brussel sprouts were shredded and packed with flavours (mildly spicy). The sable was cooked to perfection and she said brussel sprouts side complimented the sable very well. My other friend ordered rare albacore tuna with butter radish and she loved it too. I don't eat cooked fish, so the only meat dish option for me was the blood sausage. This is my first time tasting blood sausage and the chef did it nicely. The dish comes with two blood sausage medallions that were nicely seared. 

For dessert, we shared a deconstructed apple crumble and Angel Food cake with cream cheese ice cream. The apple crumble was fresh shredded honey apple crisps and some crumble bits. The cream cheese ice cream was delicious, it was very rich and flavourful with the perfect balance of sweetness. The angel cake was delicious but I would have liked a slice instead of small pieces. 

Plating of all of the dishes except for the tuna left a lot to be desired. The plating doesn't seem very professional and in some cases, they are how I would have plated my cooked dishes at home."}
{"text":"Grew up on donairs and the maritime ways,,,,,,this place is too tarawnta for a REAL bluenoser like me. Was down after my ex showed up on the news as missing ...possible serial killer so my bestie , tanya , says.. \"Hey what about that palce we read about?\" I bike from the east end and am told we don't do take out....its too much hassle...thats not very maritimer like now is it...I could have let city Kyle get 2 to go by sitting down ordering 2 donairs then taking a bite of each then asking them to wrap it up....but if the food reflects this policy i rather eat the nasty ones at greenwood and danforth...boo on your east coast roots...came too far to leave empty handed"}
{"text":"My new favourite restaurant.
The service was great. The portions are small so it's best you order a few dishes to share. My boyfriend and i shared the remix, a great way to start the meal. We then shared the Halifax Donairs and Potato Fondue & Smoked Sausage. Both dishes were unique and delicious, something that i had never tried before. For dessert, i had a crispy toffee bar. It's good, but not worth $8. (I rather go buy a crunchie bar).
I would definitely go back and try some of their seafoods next time."}
{"text":"Came here for post-dinner drinks and a snacky.  Really enjoyed it!  It's a chic space.  We sat at the bar, which was pretty comfy, and gave us a chance to chat it up with their friendly service staff!  

Our drinks were tasty.  My wife loved the Pink Lady and I enjoyed my drink, but forgot the name (it was strong!).  The cocktails were interesting and inventive!  

We ordered the smoked mackerel oatcakes ($10) and they were really wonderful!  It comes with 3 pieces and makes for an excellent starter.  Super tasty, but not too filling.  The oat cake is deliciously sweet, flakey, but with a crunch.  Each piece had a generous meaty serving of mackerel on a dollop of creme fraiche topped with fresh baby fennel.  It was surprisingly tasty!  Thumbs up!

Would definitely come back to try more of the food and drinks.  We hear duck confit is coming to the menu soon...."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. I think because I had high hopes, my expectations were not met. We had an 8:30 reservation and they sat us at a pretty nice table near the Triscuit box display (We thought that was a funny, cheeky display... though the OCD in some of us were annoyed that some of the boxes didn't line up with the others.). A few other Yelp reviews mentioned the service isn't very good and I agree. I think the service somewhat ruined an otherwise good experience. The service wasn't so much that the servers were rude or forgetful, but many of them seemed distant, uninterested, and unenthusiastic. We were greeted by a server (with the Brooklyn \"bougie hipster\" aesthetic -- just as a point of reference for us Americans!) who didn't seem like he cared about any of the food. He didn't go into detail about their philosophy or genre nor did he discuss the special items at all. Oftentimes, diners want to hear what is available and self-described epicureans want to know details like where the ingredients are from, what is unique about these items, etc. That wasn't really happening. I had to ask several questions about the dishes, if this was a sharing or individual plates menu, blah blah blah... 

The cocktails for five people took quite a long time... probably 25-30 minutes upon ordering. When my friend kindly asked our server, he made some hand motion suggesting they were on their way and that those were \"a lot of drinks so it's taking awhile. It's coming soon.\" Hmm... not sure how five drinks constitutes as an overwhelming amount of drinks, but okay... Were they brewing & distilling vodka from fresh potatoes in the kitchen?? Geez. The drink, however, was lovely. I ordered a \"Breath of Air\" and it was refreshing like, well, a breath of air!

In terms of the food, I thought they had solid dishes. We started off with the smoked mackerel which my friends said was delicious (I didn't try this one.) It was also (mostly) lovely in presentation; the fennel fronds atop the mackerel added some nice color but I think the garnish overwhelmed its otherwise aesthetic simplicity.The hot crab dip with Triscuits was fantastic. Slightly rich, and full of crab flavor. There were five of us and they only gave us a handful of crackers. Why so stingy?!?! Not good, Hopgood's! Not good. And when they offered more crackers, it was another five. Boy, those Triscuits must be REALLY pricy! Pshhhh! The steak with chanterelles and shallot jam was solid. Nicely prepared beef. The \"special\" pork and fried oysters were my favorite. I liked the \"surf and turf\" take on it. We ordered the tuna tartare as well which we thought would come maybe at the beginning of the meal, but it came out last. It was fresh and not very fishy. 

Back to service for a bit... the time in between dishes were rather long. We didn't appreciate the pacing. The \"sharing\" plates were so small for five that we went through them quickly. Instead of having a nice flow in between plates, we just found ourselves hungry and eager to see the next dish. We were there so long that we felt like wolves when we received a plate... of small bites. I've been to other \"we encourage to share\"/\"small plates\" spots, but Hopgood's was probably my least favorite in the last decade. I really hope they get it together. Hospitality counts... and so does making sure the food stands alone. Both failed to hit the mark with our group. What a shame."}
{"text":"Overall It was a good meal but I was expecting a lot more given all the hype. Definitely some interesting flavours but wash;t world changing. Not rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Friendly servers that really know their stuff, buzzy vibe and excellent food. My bf and I had a great time here last night.  We ordered the roasted beet salad, scallops with black pudding and spicy baked clams with honey turnips and a side of roast potatoes. The roasted beet salad is nicely put together with rich sour cream and orange slices, and the turnips were tiny and sweet.  Nice little touches that make a difference. It's not a large menu but there are fun things on it you won't find elsewhere.  

My partner mentioned that his scallops were a little underdone for his taste (but admitted he does prefer them not to be on the rawer side which is how they cook them here - fair enough) and the restaurant insisted on offering a free dessert to make up for it.  As we were leaving I was given a paper bag with a nice sized bottle of their own hot sauce inside.  I have no idea why - maybe because I ordered the spicy clams - but how nice was that?"}
{"text":"Good food but not standout.  Unsure if I would come back.  The octupus is a must get."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place, but left feeling let down.

The food that I did have tasted good enough, but I wondered where the rest of it was.  The portions were just far too small - especially considering that the meal was over $100 for two.

Perhaps the worst aspect was the slow service.  They waited a long time to take our orders, and even longer to bring the food.  We received our mains 2 hours after sitting down.  Normally this wouldn't be a big problem - we were in the company of friends, after all - but 20 minutes after receiving those mains, they came by to tell us that the next party had arrived and that they needed the table.  Ridiculous!

If you have lots of money, a small appetite, lots of time, but like to eat your meal in under 20 minutes, this is the place for you.  Otherwise, I'd pass.

On another note, It's worth pointing out that the 7 filtered reviews have an average score of 1.8, which is significantly lower than the review scores that they haven't filtered."}
{"text":"Our experience at Hopgood's can be summed up with two words: Nearly Great. 

First off, contrary to some others, we had great service. We walked in on a whim without a reservation - on a Friday evening - and were instantly accommodated. Our server could not have been friendlier and more knowledgeable - service was first class.

The food, that's where the nearly great comes in. Hopgood's are riding the current fashion of \"let's serve small plates of food at full plate prices and say it's for sharing\". This to say, that for what they're serving, the prices are on the high side. 

We started with plate of house made pickles. A nice mixture, sweet and sour cauliflower, spicy beans, asparagus. The beans were too vinegary for our taste, but otherwise this was a great plate, especially as it arrived with our beers. 

We then moved on to a plate of cubes of raw tuna, served with dill and watermelon pieces. This again was nice, but the tuna was so cold that it was nearly frozen. I realize that a kitchen has to walk a fine line between flavour and food safety, but the cold fish really distracted from the flavour of the dish, which could have been excellent at the proper temperature. 

The lobster spaghetti were both overcooked and a tad over-salted. The portion of lobster was somewhat sparse. To be honest, we weren't sure if the dish had not been tasted in the kitchen, or if the idea was to create a nod to 1970's food. It wasn't bad, but more what I'd expect from a lobster shack on the Atlantic coast, for $5.00. 

The final dish was the lobster sammy and it was the highlight of the evening except for the price. With lobster prices at an all time low, $22 for a, admittedly very good, lobster roll seemed somewhat expensive. 

The problem that Hopgood faces, in my opinion, is that they're good, but not great. And in the category they're operating in, there's plenty of great at comparable prices.

For example, we had the crudo at Parts and Labour the week before, where the, also raw, fish was served at the correct temperature - it might sound picky, but it made all the difference. 

If they get the details right, and adjust the pricing, Hopgood's has all the ingredients for a successful neighbourhood restaurant. If not, it'll be an also run."}
{"text":"Came here earlier tonight - they are pretty busy.

We ordered he crab dip with triscuits  - yum!
I had the stew and my bf ordered the corned beef.  Both were delicious.  My bf would say the portion sizes were on the smaller side.  The server was super nice, but the service was on the slower side.  No harm no foul - we were in the company of good friends and good convo, so it was fine.

Nice vibe - casual and relaxed.  Small menu with a few specials."}
{"text":"\"Hopgoods Foodliner is one of those fantastic ideas that should be a sure bet, when well executed. I have no doubts, from all that I have heard, that this is exactly how it started out. Full steam ahead, all pistons firing and right on the money. I'm not sure what happened last night.....\"

{"text":"Decent donair but not with it for the price.  Atmosphere was too classy to eat a donair in.  There's a place on the danforth that has a good donair."}
{"text":"Was really deciding between 2 or 3 stars. The food is probably 3 stars, but while the servers were nice enough, the service was so slow! No one came around to let us know that the food would be delayed, and even getting our bill was slow. The food was interesting but a bit on the sweet side. Got the beef tartar, donair, scallops, fiddleheads. The fiddleheads was probably the best dish. The place is pretty pricey for the portions"}
{"text":"Hopgoods is a revelation - a truly original restaurant, with absolutely incredible food. I could eat donairs all day, everyday. I could also eat tuna tartare, oysters, white asparagus, crab dip, and anything else that that kitchen is turning out. I've never had a bad dish at Hopgoods, and the cocktails are lovely. Further, the service is absolutely impeccable - not formal or stuffy in any way, just the perfect amount of friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. I've been for dinner several times, and every time, it's just been the best experience. Highly, highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I do like this place, the food is great, but the service was just brutal on our visit for our 7th year anniversary.  I wanted to cut the waiter out of the equation and run our own food.  What does a guy have to do around here to get a dirty martini."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant for the first time for a friend's birthday party. We reserved the back room and had a fairly large room all to ourselves. The servers let us connect or own music and really make the space our own. 

Since we were in a group we had the family-style full course menu which was around 45$ each for 6 people not including alcohol. 

Everything was amazing here, the Halifax donair really stood out for me.

Great place for a party. Would love to come back again."}
{"text":"Great Odin's Raven! I love this place. I read the reviews of the rude wait staff and granted we went on a Monday night, but our server was super friendly - even had the bartender make me a custom drink (which was solid). We tried a variety of dishes - the lobster bisque, which was very rich, lobster rich, flavor rich and incredible. Tried the crab dip but the triscuits really didn't work for me - still a decent dish though.  The main dish - braised veal cheeks with hazelnuts and turnip (I know, odd) was mind blowing. I really hope they keep this on the menu. I tried the donair and while it was good, it didn't strike me as anything special but for $16 for two donair sandwiches, one shouldn't really complain. The dessert was their version of the Twix bar (forget the name) and yep, was amazing too. 
This is what Black Hoof should try to emulate. 
Halifax should be proud of Hopgoods."}
{"text":"I ruined donairs for myself by having the first I ever had here.

While the place has a truly excellent menu, offering just enough variety for someone to find a favourite without overdoing things, it is truly the donairs that stand head and shoulders above the competition.

Easily the best Nova Scotian fare in Toronto, and possibly the best donairs in the country. I will never say no to a trip out here, even though I don't own a care nor have a Metropass and getting to Roncie is an absolute pilgrimage from the east end."}
{"text":"You have been here before!!!!

If you have eaten out much around Toronto, you have been to this place before.  Here is what I mean....

1. The space is small, but has cool lighting and some off-beat music playing.
2. The menu is on a chalkboard.
3. There is bone marrow on the menu.

(1-3 are all a nod to the much hyped Black Hoof)

4. The food is good, and in spots very good. While the ever-present tuna tartare was visually appealing, it lacked flavor.  The sweetbreads were delicious.
5. The portions were smallish at prices that are not. The food is not so spectacular that you won't find the same thing at the same price all over town.
6. The cocktails (12-14$) were good, but priced and similar to anywhere else.
7. The bar doubled as the side work area and employee conversation and cell phone checking area. 
8. The service was simply abysmal. Rarely have I eaten at an overpriced place that exuded such a careless attitude toward customers as this.  If you eat here and don't come back, you won't be missed.

In conclusion, this is another verse of the same song. The food and decor of the place are with the times enough to return here, as it feels like lots of other places. But for a dinner that will run over 100$ for two, the service is not."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed myself at this place. Made a reservation Saturday night for a party of four, and we were seated immediately upon arrival. Service was speedy, informative, and pleasant. I ordered the blood sausage dish, while my friend had the baked sable fish. My dish was tasty without feeling overly heavy, perfectly paired with a delicately flavored celery root puree. My friend's' sable fish was tender and juicy, and the ndjua sauce gave it a distinctively kimchi-like kick.  The shared cheese plate with honeycomb and crispy bread was also quite delicious . I'd come back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Halifax donair all the way.  Back room for a reso is a must.  Great space for a 8 - 12 person party.  Didnt have the seafood platter but have heard good things. Same goes for the scallops.  The Notorious PIG was a hit with our group."}
{"text":"I had been to Hopgoods Foodliner (note to Yelp: there's no apostrophe in the name) for dinner several months ago and really enjoyed the food, so when it came time to pick a restaurant for a New Year's Day brunch, this was a no-brainer.

There aren't too many choices on the menu, so it wasn't too difficult for me to choose my dish. I went with the Full Scotian, which comes with \"Black Pudding, Bacon, Potato Pancake, 2 Fried Hen Eggs and Mushroom.\"

It sounds really simple but I have to say I was completely blown away by the complexity of this dish. My first bite was one of the mushrooms and I immediately knew that I had chosen well. Cooked perfectly, the mushrooms boasted an irresistibly smoky flavor that made them somewhat addictive. Same goes for everything else on the plate, with the potato pancake on the bottom ranking as one of the best latke-type items I've ever eaten. (It was just so soft and delicious!)

Really, it was a flawless plate of food. I should note that I also tried a bite of someone else's Hot Chicken and it was equally spectacular.

The only negative was the dessert, the Crispy Toffee. This was my fault, as I had ordered it last time and didn't like it then, either.

Hopgoods Foodliner does, without question, belong on any list ranking the best Toronto restaurants. I'm looking forward to trying more of their food."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars.  I'm rounding up because I'm pretty sure that a few of the other meals I had in Toronto made this one seem less awesome than it really was.

Started with the smoked mackerel.  It was a good mix of salty, savory, sweet, soft, creamy, crunchy.  A really well balanced dish.  I do not agree with the other reviewer - there is no way to comfortably fit one oat cracker into your mouth.  And I felt the oat cracker held up well (and should be consumed in 2-3 bites).

Next was the asparagus with morels and a duck egg.  It was so good that I broke my \"no bread\" rule and sopped up the sauce left in the bottom of the bowl.

The short ribs.  Such a huge disappointment.  I LOVE short ribs.  But these were over-cooked, dry... boo.  Please fix this, Hopgoods.  I woulda given you five stars if it weren't for this...

Finally, the halifax donairs.  I was really worried about these.  A sweet sauce on top of a savory dish?  Well, it worked.  The sauce wasn't that sweet, the round flat bread was fluffy, the meat was tender... really an excellent, filling dish.

Drinks: small. Handcrafted. Nothing amazing.

Attire: casual. Don't get dressed up.

Location: a little out of the way (from downtown).  It is in a cool, funky neighborhood."}
{"text":"Good food deafening noise. Four of us on a Friday night ordered a variety of small appetizer dishes - which were generally excellent and well priced. Good selection of wine by the glass. Service was erratic. The wait staff do not seem to have allocated tables but pitch in where necessary. The result is both erratic and at times disorganized with staff trying to remove plates when more dishes were coming. The noise level was horrendous. You had to shout to make yourself heard. There are no sound absorbing surfaces: wood floors, drywall walls and ceilings. If you are next to a noisy table conversation is all but impossible. Without the noise I would have rated this restaurant higher"}
{"text":"Went to have brunch for Mother's Day and found the modern, nautical decor charming and the service very fast & friendly! 

Had the chicken & waffles which were the best mix of sweet & savoury with a hint of heat! 

The toffee crunch bar for desserts was decadent but somehow still light & airy!

I'm excited to go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"The food was spectacular - such amazing flavours, presentations, and combinations.

But what really struck me here was the service. At the beginning of our dinner, we were told that our food will be a bit late due to a chef being sick. The food was very late. When our dinner was over, the kind waiter came and offered us shots for the whole table and thanked us for being patient. We told him that only 2/5 people there drink, so he came back with 2 shots, left, and came back again to give us all free desserts to-go. Really was a memorable service - can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I didn't know this until the day of, but Hopgood's has been deemed one of the top ten best restaurants in the country. After visiting their establishment, I believe they deserve that recognition. The food was amazing, I went with three other friends and was able to sample most of the dishes at the table. I wasn't disappointed with any of the selections. 

Additionally, the service was above par and the atmosphere had a good energy to it.  I will definitely be going back. Here is what we ordered:

Halifax Donairs - A must..!
Puff Daddy & Notorious P.I.G. - Highly recommended
Charred Octo, Pork Sausage & Romesco Sauce - In my opinion the best entrée we had..
Cauliflower & Hazelnut Salad - Really good
Digby Scallops, Roasted Beets & Walnuts - Excellent dish

Other dishes that received praise from the table although I was unable to try due to an allergy:

Steak Tartare
Hot Crab Dip & Triscuits"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday at 6pm without a reservation. Luckily, we were able to get the last table (provided we were out by 8pm!), although it happened to be awkwardly placed really close to the door. The menu is short and sweet, written on a blackboard along with the specials. There are about ~6 appetizers and ~5 mains, plus 2 desserts. 

For drinks, there are a few interesting sounding cocktails. I had the Pink Lady, a classic for anyone who likes gin, which was nice and went down smooth. I wasn't that hungry so I had 2 starters. I had the asparagus puree soup, which was delicious and you could tell they put butter in it because it was so creamy... Next I had the Nova Scotia marinated Halibut, which was like a work of art. The fish is sashimi-style, with olive oil, lemon, arugula and pretty (and edible) violets. It was alright, but didn't taste as great as it looked. My DC had the asparagus salad, which was pretty big and nicely presented. For his main, he had the fried oyster po'boy, served on a baguette with BBQ chips on the side. I think he liked the po'boy, but the chips were just okay. For dessert, we had this vanilla pudding, with tiny shortbread cookies and merenque served in a mason jar. Again, beautiful presentation. Thankfully, this dessert was just as tasty as it looked! 

2 cocktails + 3 appetizers + 1 main + 1 dessert = $120 including tax and tips. It was good, but not great value IMO. The atmosphere is casual chic and servers were okay (the waitress was a bit snarky when I ordered 2 appetizers and no main...! But otherwise attentive). I might come back here for drinks/snacks, but not sure if it's worth to for a full meal."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is all about! I was so excited to try this restaurant because I heard so many good things and my brother was raving about it. First off, the service here is excellent. However, the food is not as good as I hope it'll be.
We started off with the pork shoulder with peanut and coffee. I believe it was $14. I liked it and it was good. I couldn't really taste the coffee but my date said he could.
Next, we had the potato fondue with sausage. I believe that this was also $14. This dish is essentially mashed potato with melted cheese on top. This was by far my favourite savoury dish. The sausage was not too spicy and anything with melted cheese is a thumbs-up in my book.
The third dish we had was the donair. I think this was $18. It was SO spicy, I was dying near the end! I've had donair before in the Maritime so I was expecting it to be more sweet than spicy. Overall, the meat was very tender and the dish was good...I just couldn't handle the spicy level.
Lastly, we ordered a dessert - crispy toffee for $8. It was delicious! I just wish it was bigger for the price it was. It was a perfect combination of savoury and sweet.
If I were to come back to this restaurant, it'll be solely for the potato fondue and the dessert."}
{"text":"I love it when the food lives up to the hype.  The best thing I had here was the Cape Breton snow crab legs.  I know people will be like \"hey, that's just generic defrosted crab legs that are all-you-can-eat at Mandarin Buffet\".  That is so not the case.  Those lanky crustacean legs are so sweet and succulent; I wish I could have a stash in my fridge and eat it every day. There are a lot of menu items and everything I had was very good.  So, if you're going with a small party of people, be smart when it comes to ordering.  My friend and I made the mistake of getting two heavy dishes (clams casino and hot crab dip) so we were a little overwhelmed.  Other than that, everything was great!"}
{"text":"The dinner menu was okay, a bit expensive and portion sizes small. The only thing they really got right was the crispy toffee bar. I would only go back for this dessert."}
{"text":"Being a big fan of the hoof, i was excited to try Hopgood's restauraunt.

All in all, i found the food rich in flavour, well put together, interesting dishes, great drinks, excellent service with a smile...

The cons for me however were that the portions were small, some dishes the flavours were overpowering and focused on the wrong element, and some dishes were just not inventive enough.

For example, the spot prawn cocktail was a british style thousand isalnd style cocktail sauce....same old same old just with radishes. The lamb heart tartare is the best dish, but it's overpowered by olives. let the protein shine (though i must say that the dehydrated milk was genius - he brought that with him from the hoof).
The entrees are great like the scallops, the chicken, the corned beef, but they're all too small. 

After the experience and spending some good coin, i went for my second dinner to another restaurant. I like restaurant hopping, but i expected a little more from the foodliner. That being said, it's definately not a place i won't recommend. Just with a caveat that it needs some polishing still and is meant for ppl with smaller appetities."}
{"text":"The place is good. It gets 4 because of the food, not because of the service.

Do - Order the crab dip with the Triscuit. It is really good. So much creamy goodness. And the Triscuits is served warm.

Do - Order the Donair - It's like a shawarma but different, and a little sweeter. Can't go wrong with this, east coast amazigness. A little messy to eat but worth it.

Do - Order the Oysters. Simple and good. 

Caution: The servers are a little pretentious, especially the hat-wearing-fake-smiling one. Had us on a timer and would remind us how much time we had left before the next reservation.

The food was good, the service not so much. Would I go back? Maybe."}
{"text":"Like the others below I can say that the food won me over but service wasn't stellar.  It wasn't \"awful\" but just could have been way more prompt and really just more suited to the price point.  However, it's a cool concept and again... food was excellent across the board!  Oysters were fresh and wonderful, smoked mackerel on oatcakes were amazing and on and on.....  Cocktails were also creative and rather delicious!"}
{"text":"This place just had it's soft opening on Thursday so kids, RUN don't walk before you start waiting in line for a good hour to eat and drink here. 

VIBE 
As per Hopgood and the Hoof vibe, it's casual and relaxed. The infamous handwriting is on the chalkboard but they have mini menus as well. 

We sat at the bar, as per usual, and talked to the staff and they were genuinely excited to be working together again. It's a well oiled machine and very cool to see what Hopgood's version of a bar/dinner place would be (but Brunch will be done in the next bit once things are up and running). 

On the first night after soft opening, every seat was filled. There is a back area as well and it was cute to see the shelves lined with triscuits and carnation milk. I have a feeling there will be no art work on the wall. My FAVOURITE decor item in the joint is the lit up picture of Hopgood's Foodliner  from the 60s. The name came from the supermarket his grandfather owned in Halifax. You can see the beautiful old fashioned cars in the photo. It just works. Otherwise, the food speaks for itself. Speaking of...

WE ATE/DRANK
I love love love that there is 50 on the drink menu! It actually went very well with the East Coast menu. 
One weird thing was that our mains were served before our apps but we just went with it. We had the scallops and the crispy pork shoulder. It was served with broccoli and milk that was reduced and shaved onto the plate (ah molecular gastronomy). Unfortunately, i twas a miss for us. The scallops were a bit charred and it just didn't go well together. 

But the crab dip. Oh my goodness, that crab dip! Crablicious! The triscuits are warmed up and it is phenomenal. 
I didn't have the donnairs but they seem to be a hit. 
My friend had the lamb tartare and though I'm not a big fan of raw meat, I had a taste and it was DELICIOUS. If you want a more adventurous dish, they do this phenomenally. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
It's already a hit and another reason why people will be flocking to the newly gentrified Roncesvalles strip. And interesting note: Geoff's place is right near Geoffrey Street. Love! So proud to see him back in the scene again. He's one of my favourite chefs."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The wait staff really friendly and attentive. Probably some of the best I've ever had. 
We tried the crispy pig ear salad, oysters,  donairs, Lobster Spaghetti, Cauliflower clams and crispy toffee for desert.  
I would definitely not leave without trying the Lobster Spaghetti."}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is incredibly slow. They'd do much better with a proper reservation system. Can be frustrating without a reservation a week in advance. Don't do standby at the bar."}
{"text":"They have oysters with fresh horseradish and a shallot dressing here. The dressing was good, and it came with fresh horseradish and house-made hot sauce. $3.50 per shuck, so not cheap, but worth it compared to what happened next. 

They have a dish called Surf and Turf. This is not your standard Surf and Turf. The way restaurants generally lay out their menu is the title would be the main feature of the dish and the subtext would be the complementary items. Not in this case, though. The main is the subtext so you get no steak and no lobster and just bone marrow. Had I known that bone marrow was the main feature and not a complementary item, I wouldn't have ordered it. The server asked how it was and I said that it was not that good and not what we expected. He didn't seem to care, I think he just asked because robotically that's what they do 3 minutes after you get your meal? 

We ordered a fish dish after and jokingly were like \"please be fish and not the gills or eyeballs or something.\" We got it and it was fish. It was good but nothing amazing. We were starving though. This dish was not worth coming back for. 

I think they did a good job with the oysters. They're knowledgeable about beer and cider, but you can get that anywhere. Unfortunately, the bone marrow dish was pretty bad, but I'm no pro when it comes to bone marrow. The fake care when it came to asking how everything was was not appreciated; if you don't care then don't ask. If you're into bone marrow, you may be less disappointed than I was. 

With all the great options on Roncesvalles, and all the other great spots for oysters in the city, I can't say I will be back here."}
{"text":"On paper, I should have loved Hopgood's Foodliner. Chef Hopgood is an alumnus of Black Hoof, which I love. The philosophy he took to Hopgood's Foodliner is similar, and hence strikes a chord with me. In reality, I had a much sub-par meal here.

The steak was a very bad (tough) cut of meat, and most certainly unjustified at $45. It came with a mound of shaved raw onions/radishes, which didn't make any sense. It was drizzled with a sauce that, for luck of a better term, I would call \"funky\".  It was a strange dish indeed.  

The crab main had little crab meat, and was served on ice with bland clarified butter. I'm all for simplicity with seafood, but c'mon clarified butter? A lot more could have been done to showcase the crab.

The street-style donaire was way too sweet and was served on paper for authenticity. Authentic or not, it was a sloppy way to eat at a sit-down \"classy\" restaurant. 

The expensive cocktail was lackluster.  

I understand the concept - Hopgood tries to capture Nova Scotia though the eyes of a backpacking foodie-hipster.  The concept is good, but the execution is very poor.

I know this place can do better than that. I once read an article were Grant Van Gameren (also a Black Hoof alumnus ) was quoted saying that Hoopgood's Foodliner is one of his favorite spots in the city. I guess I must have caught them on one of those proverbial \"off\" nights. I might come back here for a second visit."}
{"text":"The food was good as was the service.  Had grits and shrimp which was excellent; my companion had clams and said they alone were worth a return trip.

The Sunday menu seemed a bit skimpy to me but then, my needs are modest  and what was there was good. As a luddite, the absence (or even presence of wi-fi means little to me) but I can see this being a game-changer for those considering a meal.

I can see this being a popular place in the evening; must come back and try it then"}
{"text":"Foodliner was a bit of an unexpected find for us as our original plan was to go to Barque's (BBQ) which is just down the street. We got to the restaurant at around 7:45 on a Friday night and unfortunately, like others on the street, it was fully booked with like 2 hours :( - so just as we were about to walk away, one of the servers told us about an open room in the back that is cold/raw seafood bar. It sounded good so we followed through the restaurant in to this quaint 10 tall bar table with a centre metal trough of ice - very cool looking and private room!

So we pretty much had the room to ourselves for most of the night where sampled delicious chilled/smoked seafood! With the 4 of us we tried:

Oysters on the ice (PEI and New Brunswick types)
Small neck clams
Perwinkles
Shrimp cocktail
Smoked tuna plate x 2
Lobster crudo

Wow - all of the food was fresh and flavourful - oysters tasted like they just came from the ocean! Clams (raw) are a bit stronger in flavour so just a heads up if you are a big shellfish fan. Periwinkles aka smoked sea snails were tasty little tid-bits that you pulled out of the shell - don't be intimated by them, they are good plus at 2 bucks it is a great bargain. Our group loved the smoked tuna so much we ordered it twice - hence the x 2. Finally we topped it off with some wonderful lobster crudo which to me is like a cold lobster salad with creme friache, cumcumbers, crispy rice crackers and jalapeno. Our other 2 friends shared a whole lobster cracked in front of them.

All in all, wonderful food and very friendly and knowledgaeable servers. We will definitely return to try their main menu. The back room itself makes for a great private party room. In total, the price was $180/four people which wasn't too pricey given the quality of the food. But as a warning - this was the cold bar menu so you aren't going to come away stuffed but you will be delighted satisfied by the flavoured."}
{"text":"Great evening!  We had a table for two by the window.  I was worried there would be draft but it was really fine.  The service was great.  I think we had two or three waiters.  All were friendly, informal, professional.
We had interesting and tasty cocktails, a dozen oysters, cured flounder (which was out of this world), molasses bread and two servings of cheese.
The menu is a bit limited.  It's fine, I don't need a lot of choice but if you have an allergy or food restrictions you will have to ask for substitutions.  We were full, well cared for.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Another one of those........... hipster Toronto restaurants with overly price small plates

Key words:  Good food,  service with (bad) attitude, hipster atmosphere, small-size plate, overly priced.

SAT AT THE BARD (BAD IDEA). Was ignored by the bartender for half an hour before we were offered a drink and the menu.  In the mean time, plenty of waiting staffs and bus boys were standing right next to us texting and tweeting away on their cell phones.  No one offered to serve us. Service is not a priority here. 

Food was good. However, it seems that Toronto has ran out of restaurant ideas.

 The place is cool, funkily decorated, small tapas-size plates, nice urban music, electric cocktail at ~ $15 each.  BUT, places like this are dimes and dozens in Toronto.  

Two cocktails + 2 small plates + tax +15% tip (for an undeserving service) = $100. 

Conclude: Glad to have gone for the sake of saying that I have eaten here. However, I won't return. They have to do better to earn my business."}
{"text":"Sweet, spicy and get outta here delicious hopgoods foodliner delivers exactly what I'm after: flavour! And lots of it. Service was friendly however a bit slow for my party's liking.

Sweetbreads, tuna tartare, oatcakes, and Donairs are what we tried.
 
4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend loved this restaurant although we found that their meat platter was overcooked. Drinks were good, dessert was good. Server was personable and cool. The shawarma was just plain bad- no flavour and pretty expensive. This restaurant is creative and unique, it deserves to succeed. It just needs to fine tune it's menu a bit."}
{"text":"They have brunch now! I live so close by that I've seen Hopgood's go from dipping their toes into brunch with special holiday brunches near Christmas, with a regular Sunday brunch now on offer. So I've had a few great brunches there in the past few months, but I'll focus on the most recent outing.

Food: Just like their dinner, the brunch is outstanding and creative all around, including cocktails and desserts. It seems like the menu is evolving, because the Asian-inspired egg and snow crab omelette I had is no longer on their online menu. It was delicious--perfectly cooked eggs with earthy, salty Asian flavoring that was the right amount of gentle for breakfast. Fiance and I shared a side of juicy sausage that provided that holy-grail burst of flavor and texture all sausage eaters lust after.  I can't even remember what he ordered for an entree because I was so wrapped up in my own meal!

For dessert we shared a house-made chocolate bar, which was rich, creamy, decadent, etc., etc. We both had a little death. Well worth the indulgence. 

Ambiance: Charming and relaxed but not overly casual. It's definitely the right vibe for high-end East Coast comfort food. 

Service: With the exception of one very awkward service moment some friends and I shared at Hopgoods a year or so ago (the waiter chased us down the street to tell us not that we didn't leave a tip at all, but that we didn't leave a good tip--only to realize he hadn't counted our cash properly--talk about embarrassing. It put us off for a while but this place is too good to hold a grudge!), the service here is consistently excellent; graciousness that reminds you that you're somewhere that's a cut above without being stuffy.

You get the sense that Hopgoods is a true labor of love on part of the chef/owner,  something you feel when you're being served and something you can absolutely taste in the quality of the meals. It's that dose of real care that I think keeps the place queued up on the weekends for dinner. And if you haven't been for brunch yet, get your bad self up on Sunday morning and head over to Roncesvalles!"}
{"text":"This last weekend, on our first trip to Toronto, my wife and I were to meet old friends with whom we used to dine when we lived in New Orleans.  I'd read in various places that the help was a little uppity, so when our friends let us know that they were running late -- babysitter fell through -- we were worried not simply because they would be late, but because they were bringing a 7-month old in tow.  I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG. The staff at Hopgood's was awesome: they gave us our table, didn't bat an eyelash at the little guy when the rest of our party arrived, and treated us with the kind of courtesy you're just not allowed to expect.  I'm not saying \"bring your kids!\", but for those reviewers who complain about the service: your standards are simply absurd.  I've rarely been given the kind of welcome I received here.  And they had no good reason to do so in light of the problems we created for them.

Food: We ordered around half of the menu, and were satiated by the end.
Crown Bacon: was unreal.  I'm actually still trying to figure out what it was, but I want more.  Perfect textural contrast of celery root and the bacon. 

Smoked mackerel: thanks to earlier reviewers who advised about the crumbliness of the oatcake.  You have to Chairman Kaga that whole piece. Huge flavor and wonderful mouth feel.

Pickles: Simple concept, difficult to pull off.  Pulled off perfectly here.  Two orders. (Same with the bread; I don't mind paying for bread if it's good, and it was).

Halifax Donairs: I'm not Canadian, and there appears to be a good bit of controversy about this dish.  I've never had a donair before, so take this for what it's worth: I described it as the best gyro I've ever had. 

Hot Crab Dip: Where did the crab dip go? 

Tuna Tartare: On this I agree with some of the skeptics. It was beautiful, and it was perfectly clean.  But given the huge flavors we'd been exposed to by this point in the meal, it was difficult to appreciate this dish.  On the one hand, you want bigger flavors; on the other, doesn't  the perfect tartare speak for itself?  

Smoked sweetbreads: Wonderfully butchered/cleaned.  Perfectly cooked.  A nice exterior crisp to offset the creamy interior of the meat.  The caulifower added to this effect. Really delicious. 

Crispy toffee: I can't put it better than another reviewer: best candy-bar you'll ever eat.

Bourbon pudding: A perfect match for the toffee; not too sweet, I thought.  We all decided that the toffee and pudding combo at the end cemented the whole experience.  It absolutely ranks as one of our favorite dining experiences.  

One last note/advice for foreigners: the cocktails were great, but folks from the US might find themselves disappointed by their size.  The drink size is standard, as far as I can tell, for restaurants in Toronto.  Whereas US drinks are approx. 3-4 fluid ounces, here 2-3 seems typical."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, with a chilled/casual, but upscale ambiance and price points. Seafood is great, although not cheap. Everything is really well balanced

Have now been here twice and was sad to learn they're closing soon.

On our most recent visit, we had a gift card that a friend had bought for us. They are closing in 1 month and sent us an email as an FYI. This was cool of them!"}
{"text":"Came here 6 months ago, vibrant environment, was around the neighborhood after some movies, found this on yelp! Server was friendly, large menu selection, I will say the scallop was amazing, they forgot our salad, but I thank them forgetting, my date was keen on them, not me. The scallop was amazing, the Halifax donair was interesting, served on a paperbag, can get a bit messy. Dessert was limited by the time we arrived, 3 out of 6 are sold out, leaving the apple crumble was just ok."}
{"text":"Hopgoods Foodliner is a great place to enjoy dinner. Went there with two other people on a Thursday night. The restaurant was not full about there was a good crowd. The waiters are really nice and attending so overall it was a good experience. We ordered:
1. The Halifax Donair
2. Chilled Cape Breton Snow Crab
3. Scallops with Cabbage, Bacon & Apple
4. Molasses Bread & Cultured Butter
5.Pickles
6.Baked Clams
7.Honey Crisp Apple & Angel Food Cake

The Donair was extremely succulent, tender and full of flavour, the presentation of the meal was in a paper bag, which was not a problem for me. However, the white sauce was so over powering that it was a challenge to enjoy the taste of the meat. 

The Snow Crab was really fresh and it was semi cleaned so it was really easy to eat it. Unlike many other fish restaurants where you have to fight with the creature to conquer the sweet meat this was really convenient. 

Scallops were cooked to perfection the portion was really moderate. the bacon and apple combination was heavenly

The Bread and Butter. I really didnt expect anything special from the B&B. But, I was really surprised. The bread was soft and fresh, really soft and paired perfectly with the butter.

The Pickles, after seeing bunch of pickled vegetables displayed on the wall, we decided to try them. Unfortunately the pickles were the disappointment of the meal. They were super soft and soggy. Which was not a big disappointment given most of the items we ordered met the expectations 

Baked Clams was the special during our visit. I am really glad we ordered it. The clams were cooked in a spicy creamy sauce and served super hot. It was one of the highlights of the meal.

The Dessert, I have mixed feelings about the dessert overall it was kind of fusion confusion desset. Where there were different components on the plate that tasted delicious stand alone. However the combination of these items on the same platter was a miss.

Overall, I had a good time and a decent meal. When I ask myself if I would return to Hopgoods, Maybe. This restaurant is good for a visit but, many places to discover in the City."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Hopgood's for dinner before and wanted to try their brunch.  Although the service was great, the food was disappointing. The Grilled Ham and Cheese Sammy had far too many components going on, which had me wondering if they have ever actually tasted the completed dish.   There was a pile of ham, Swiss cheese, a creamy grainy Dijon, truffle oil all in the middle of 2 large pieces of buttery grilled bread which was also soaked in a sweet maple syrup, and then a fried egg was placed on the top.   This is a dish that Buddy The Elf would have loved.  The best thing on my plate were the pickled beans served on top of some dry arugula, which I am sure was an after thought. 

Throwing a bunch of impressive ingredients together does not equal a great dish.  I think Hopgood's is trying too hard and sadly we will not not go back."}
{"text":"Hopgoods really can't disappoint. The staff is a mish-mash of creative-types who know the menu like the back of their hand. 

The donair apps are consistently perfect for this East Coast gal and the beef/scallop tartar is pretty much heaven and they make some mean cocktails. 

If you drink and try everything like we do time and time again, it is pricey. Worth. It. 

The Menu is ever-changing, so I'll likely continue to update this review. 

PEPPER POINTS: For existing. I heart you."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant . Unique options. Excellent presentation. Simple food done well."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch; it's in a cool part of Roncy. Started with the beignets and had the English breakfast for the main. The beignets were AMAZING--soooo much icing sugar, fresh out the oven, melt in your mouth good. The english breakfast was pretty standard, solid meal but nothing too mind-blowing."}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner here on a recent weekend trip out to Toronto and was psyched that the menu seemed to incorporate some of my favorite ingredients and flavors.  Food didnt disappoint.  

Had the smoked mackerel on oatcakes to start - excellent.  Followed that up with the spring salad, basically fresh peas, sliced pea shoots, pea puree, pickled shallots and ricotta.  One of the best salads I've ever had and just bursting with the flavors of spring.  Followed that with tuna tartare.  Very tasty and loved the topping of the fired shallot to lend a crunch aspect.  A bit tiny for its 16 dollar price tag, however.

The entrees are where this place really shined.  Had the smoked sweetbreads with a cauliflower / truffle sauce.  Incredibly good.  Loved the addition of the thinly shaved raw cauliflower on top.  Also had the scallope with shrimp and caviar on the creamed leeks.  Scallops were cooked to perfection, leeks I could have eaten by the pound, caviar was almost non-existent and I missed the raw brine and saltiness that it provides but still one of the best tasting entrees I've had all year.

Split all 3 desserts with my GF.  Pudding was very good, carrot cake was above average as was their homemade riff on a toffee bar.

Biggest weakness, surprisingly, was the drinks.  Had a mediocre glass of barolo and followed that up with the recommended cask conditioned ale they had just tapped.  Had zero carbonation (zero) making it taste like hoppy water.

Still, that wasnt enough to downgrade the overall experience.  It's not cheap or largely portioned but some of the flavors and plating I experienced here stack up with anyones, anywhere.  41/2 stars if I could."}
