{"text":"Best thai food outside of Thailand!!  I know I was just there last year!  And I always eat Thai food!  You must eat here if you go to vegas!"}
{"text":"Love their food! The tomm kha, pad thai, and green curry are my favorite!! And their thai coffee!!!! Ahhhhh. I work 2 minutes away from here and this is my go to place!!"}
{"text":"Food was good here, but you have to be ready for an OG Asian style hole in the wall.  They won't impress you with service or ambiance, but the mural on the wall is interesting and good for a chuckle.  The trump is that the food was tasty and cheap.  We had Cashew Nuts Chicken, Crispy Pork n Chinese Broccoli, and some Pineapple Shrimp Curry.  Rice came with each order, and the staff didn't get too huffy that we showed up 20 minutes before closing and stayed a little bit after their official close time.   Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I alwayse order lunch from noodle house atleast once a week when im at work, usually get it for delivery. I usually call in my order right when they open up so I won't have to wait long for my food, but overall they are very quick when it comes to delivery. I love there green curry( kaeng kiew) it is soooo delicious! And make sure to get it spicy:) i like mines spicy to the MAX. If your not into curry thats fine also cause they have plenty of good food to choose from. Another one of there popular dish I usually order is pad kua kai(fry noodle with eggs) it is sooo yummy. The food portion is perfect also,not to little and not too much. Being thai, I give this place 2 thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite spot to get thai food. Foods always amazing. The curry the larb and the pad thai are all amazing. I definitely recommend anyone in vegas to come here. The pricepoint is good too. Lowest anywhere and food is amazing. I come here 2-3 times a week and bring friends every time!!"}
{"text":"This is a decent thai restaurant with good curries.  I think most days are on point, however,  I ordered delivery and my curry with chicken had wiered balled up clumps of deep fried ? processed chicken that was so off I couldn't eat it.  Not sure what happened here but I recommend eating in."}
{"text":"I saw many good reviews about this place so I wanted to give it a try.  Sadly I  have to say I was disappointed in the one item I ordered. I ordered an or of Pad see eew for lunch and it came out very quickly. There was only 1 table dining when I placed the togo order which I got in less than 5 minutes. I paid about $10 bucks but wasn't  able to enjoy it at all. The noodles were so greasy that there was a layer of oil at the bottom of the togo box. The noodles were all broken into small pieces and soggy. Total disappointment!"}
{"text":"The food was so good that we came twice during our short visit in Las Vegas.  Pineapple curry was wonderful.  We also had salmon curry under the specials.  Fresh ingredients.  This is a small restaurant which a big party would not be accommodated. Very casual & a bit noisy but pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the service was awful. First they ran out of white rice so we had to wait for that. They forgot one of the order so we had to wait an additional 20 minutes, after my whole party had finished eating. The waiters had no interest in customer service. Our waiter was by himself working the whole restaurant, he did the best he could. They need to hire more servers and probably more cooks. I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, just the wait was long."}
{"text":"OMG! Wonderful tasty food and very good portions, especially on the rice and soup noodle dishes!
Highly recommended is the PAD THAI -- and the PINEAPPLE RICE -- i asked them to add the Chinese sausage --  very flavorful -- texture of the noodles just right -- springy -- they don't break up -- they say a good test of a rice noodle dish  is whether the noodles break off or not, if they do, then they are missing a huge component of making the dish right.  The dishes are authentic and flavorful,  and they will ask what heat scale you would like each dish on a scale of 1-10.  No Watered down version here. We were in at 3pm on a weekday, and there were many patrons. It's not a hole in the wall place-- it's a terrific restaurant great food with quick and friendly service. PLUS, easy on the pocketbook. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I eat here every day almost , last week I was here with a friend out of town that ordered a curry , the curry was too spicy for her and we needed up ordering a new dish. 
Today I came to eat and ordered the curry, when I said it to the waitress she said immediately spice lvl 0 , i said no I want lvl 4 and she argued with me about it untill I shut her up saying how rude she is and how I'm as a customer knows what I like. Rudest waitress I ever encountered , too bad such a fine little restaurant have such rude and unprofessional waitress."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 2009, and as you can probably tell I'm a big fan!
Although one of the things that puzzle me is the fact that there have been so many different waitstaff.

Food: Almost everything I have tried is really good. I highly recommend the Basil fried rice, the panang curry and the Pad see-ew.

Service: It's fair. If you're a regular, they take care of you. If you come in large groups they give you more food. I suggest going in between the rushes.

All in all a great hole-in-the-wall to have on your list for your Thai food cravings, which alas for me is quite often...smh...(._.)"}
{"text":"Awesome authentic thai food! Price is relatively cheap, the Thai tea is recommended as the sweetness was just perfect. Fried rice dishes were also very flavorful."}
{"text":"Yet another overrated restaurant in Vegas. I need to move back to LA. I ordered the Duck Fried Rice because it was so highly esteemed, but it ended up being meh. Overall, the dish was lacking in flavor. The duck was rubbery and weak. Go to Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a long time and even bring relatives from out of town. But lately the service hasn't been much of what I'm used to..getting worse...also, they always seem to run out of duck! And they tell you after you had already ordered so you wait for it then they give you the bad news. The worst part is they substituted chicken but was still charged the same! 3 stars for good food and great price!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for 4 nights and was lucky enough to come across this hidden gem in Chinatown. We were greeted with a smile from the waitress and sat at the table in the corner. There was no more than 8 tables, yes it's really small, quaint and nothing fancy. Aside from the atmosphere I was soooooo blown away with their dishes. All their food was fresh, full of flavor and they gave you enough food to satisfy for a nice price. This was one of the best meals I've had in Vegas! I HIGHLY recommend this place. Craving to go back..."}
{"text":"I have probably been to over 25 different Thai restaurants in my lifetime and I can tell you that this place was very good.  It is a small location that isn't much to look at, but the value and quality of the food surely cannot be beat.  My boyfriend and I had \"Spicey noodles\" (drunken noodles) and pad thai and both dishes were excellent.  We both had Thai Iced Tea and had the fried banana dish with ice cream.  The Thai Iced Tea drink was huge!  The desert was good to very good, I have had better and I have certainly had worse.  All of the items that we had ranged from good to excellent in quality.  The owners and operators of this establishment were very friendly and helpful (bad Google Maps directions got us lost).  The prices are probably among the lowest, if not the lowest that I have ever seen for Thai food.  Too bad I'm just on vacation and probably won't ever be able to return!"}
{"text":"My favorite thai place in summerlin. Great service. Great price!!!"}
{"text":"Lady chased us out before we could order, and rushed us when we were the only ones in there. Probably good food but horrible service."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and was surprised that they had one on this side of town. Came here for lunch with some friends and it does not disappoint despite the difference in location."}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful hole in the wall. The food is fantastic. Spicy food is actually spicy! Wonderful place to get away from the tragic food on the strip. The prices are also amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing food, nice price! Need to try their duck fried rice next time!"}
{"text":"Papaya salad at level 6 was hot enough for the wife, but I wanted it hotter, as everything else we ordered was very mild.  I had some in Thailand that set me on fire, this was not close. I'd try at least 8 next time. 

Pad see-eu with beef was great, I added the bright red chili sauce to light it up. Kids had Khua Kai noodle and bbq pork with Chinese sausage fried rice, both very mild and kid friendly. The salmon avocado curry was really good, bright orange curry with coconut milk and tiny shreds of kaffir lime leaf, and just a bit of heat. My fault for not ordering the hot stuff, but what we had was fresh and tasty. 

Wait staff was friendly and helpful, water glasses filled often and plates cleared timely. 

The men's bathroom, however, was another story. The grime covering the light switch and the door was worthy of the worst gas station bathroom, a foot above and below the knob it was black with grime. I mean black!  The vent fan had so much dust on it you could not see the grate. And it needed a coat of paint. With that lack of cleaning in the bathroom, it makes me wonder about the kitchen. I've been to many hole in the walls with run-down bathrooms, but this was just plain filthy. So I had to deduct a star.  So really, this is about a 3.5 star review, as the place is not really a 5-star. 

But even so, I'd probably come back here for the cheap and tasty."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices. Most of the time I get theirs Lunch special, 2 items for 8$, and I have enough left overs for another lunch."}
{"text":"Kinda busy Sunday night. Waited 45+ minutes for one order of pad Thai when it was promised 15mins. I asked for a refund and they voided the wrong order and I had to come back once again to get my order refunded. They had no commission and still wanted to charge me to reorder the food even though they were the ones that made the mistake. Please NEVER NEVER COME HERE!!!!!!This place is going downhill and most likely will not be doing business with them anymore"}
{"text":"The food was good I ordered the ground chicken with basil .The service on the other hand was poor. The waitress seemed annoyed while taking our order I would have given this place four stars, but I really didn't enjoy the \"overall\" of the place because of the service."}
{"text":"I always come here every time I visit Vegas, and I never get disappointed! I always order the Thai noodle soup with flat noodle (it's number 33 I even remember ha). They use Tomyum as the soup base which they barely dilute it for the noodle soup. Unlike other places where they always dilute the soup base and you don't even taste any favor, you are almost having a real Tomyum soup here. It comes with dinced pork, fish ball, shrimp, and fish cake etc. They were all perfectly cooked! 

This time we also ordered the dumplings as an appetizer. They were ordinary but delicious! They put a bit of spicy mayonnaise on top (most likely siracha mixed with mayo) and that gives the perfect kick to the dish. 

Asian food is known to be cheaper but this is extremely reasonably priced with very high quality. It deserves 6 stars!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, we decided to try Thai Style Noodle House.  How could we not?  This place has awesome rating from 109 reviewers (not including mine).

Took the #203 bus at the corner of Neiman Marcus on Sands Ave, and within 5 minutes we were there.  Let me tell you, it was worth the trip.  

We ordered the Thai Coffee; Fish cakes; Spicy noodle soup; and Green Curry with Tofu; and Mango with Coconut Sticky rice.  YUMMO as Rachel Ray would say.  The bill came out to be $30.  Pretty cheap for Vegas dining.  

High recommend when you are all-buffet-out and want to eat good but cheap.  Good quality and great service.

Clean and spacious bathroom.

Cheers to Good Thai food!"}
{"text":"Big portions and cheap. Small location expect wait $15 min credit card charge. Pineapple Fried rice, Radna, and Pad Kee Mao wasn't great..  It would suffice as a hangover cure, only if you're able to drive here.  It's a bit far off the strip where Chinatown is.  I've had better Thai places. They were however super nice enough to accept reservations though."}
{"text":"This is a typical lunch place for my colleagues and I.  There's lots of variety and so far all have been satisfying.  The service is great as well."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!! Thank you yelpers, we were not disappointed!!!
Had the shrimp salad, duck soup, and spicy Thai noodles, all of which was delicious. Portions were bigger then I thought they would be, considering the price, so keep that in mind. Attentive and courteous service. nothing to complain about really... Except maybe (big maybe) the Thai iced tea, which wasn't as strong as I'm used too, but at the price they were offering it, I'm really not complaining. :)"}
{"text":"This place is our go to when we don't know where else to eat. The price for the food is very affordable. The food had always been good; not anything superb or spectacular though. It's like home cooked food.

I'm surprised that other people said customer service is lacking. In my experience, been here about six times, they have always been polite and pleasant. They do not have chit chat kind of customer service, which I prefer, I guess."}
{"text":"Yummy!  So many choices in this area of Vegas. Yelp steered us right yet again. The silver noodle soup was awesome."}
{"text":"Ate here on another Yelpers recommendation, and man were we glad!  Go with the house recommendations....thats what we did, and we werent disappointed.  Word of advice-dont order too spicy, stay under 5 or 6 because they really fire it up!  The red curry is delicious, especially the Panang avocado with shrimp.  Go with the S11 on the Chefs Specials list.  Amazing flat noodles.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Place is cheap compared to the strip. I've had better thai but not bad for vegas.  Place is very small and not so clean.  50 / 50 on coming back."}
{"text":"Little whole in the wall restaurant located in china town type area. Ordered spicy tom yum soup with noodles, it wz decent but a on the sweeter side. I love my soup spicy. Panag curry with chicken was abs delish, my fav. Also spicy basil w/ shrimp had a nice flavor but it was a sml portion. We had everything with brown rice which was pretty good n nutty in texure. Overall I'd def recommend this restaurant. its perfect when you want good food with cheap price tag;  Having said that,  don't go thr for the ambiance bc it's sml n plain. But yummy n delish food!! i am a fan and will def return!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Fresh, tasty Thai food & it won't break your wallet! Great value, great portions. I originally ate at the restaurant in Chinatown & this food here at Noodle House 3 is just as great. Get some!"}
{"text":"I say, I say goddamn this is the best thai food I've ever had.   Just go eat here.  The panang curry and even the kung pao were just exquisite, the spices so perfectly balanced and the price so reasonable.  Total hole in the wall diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"I keep exploring Chinatown lately and based on reviews decided to have a quick lunch at this establishment. 

It's probably the best Thai lunch special that I've got so far. I had yellow chicken curry and pork par ram. It was all good but I should probably order it spicier next time... my fault :). Total lunch cost with Thai ice tea (can never skip that) was $10 + tips.

I wonder what else am I going to discover in that area..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Me and my boyfriend stopped in here after reading the reviews on yelp. It looks like a hole in the wall. Like many Asian places it is very small but it was packed when we got there. 
The food was delicious. I ordered the wonton soup (without noodles). I think it was about $7 and the portion was huge!! 
It was so good and definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"I've got a serious addiction to Thai Style Noodle House.  I've been here an embarrassing number of times and I don't think that I will be letting up any time soon.

I can't say I would have ever tried this place if it wasn't for Yelp.  It's tucked away from the main road and is just a tiny little space with only a few tables.  And, let's face it, Chinatown isn't exactly vegetarian-friendly.  Luckily I have Yelp to fill me in - not only is this place good but it has a separate vegetarian menu as well! With a ton of items to pick from!! 

I really enjoy the Panang Curry but I have a spot in my heart for Spicy String Beans.  I don't know why I love it so much and I'm starting to question if they load it with nicotine before they give it to me.  It has a lot of flavor and the veggies are always fresh.  My husband switches between Yellow Curry, Spicy Noodles, and Thai Fried Rice and loves them all.  We've also had the Tom Kha soup and Vegetarian Dumplings and they were great as well.  Don't worry, my non-vegetarian friends, there are plenty of choices for you and everyone I've seen dining at the restaurant seems to enjoy their meals.

Things to keep in mind: The place is very small so expect a wait during lunch and dinner rush.  Also, the tables can be a little tight so if you don't like eating close to strangers you may want to come at an off-time.  Finally, and most importantly, they are not joking around with the spice here.  I usually order a \"medium\" everywhere I go and am fine with it and can usually go spicier.  Here, I get a 3 out of 10.  And there have been a handful of times where it was still too spicy for me.  I say to err on the side of caution- you can always add more chili to your food later.

So, vegetarians, rejoice!  There is another restaurant for you to add to your arsenal.  Just make sure to specify \"no fish sauce.\"  While they are usually good about it without needing to say anything, we did have one experience where fish sauce added to our meals.

If you ever find yourself in Chinatown looking for a new place to try, get your butt on over to Thai Style.  Just don't be hogging my table during the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"To be fair this review is for their store on Fort apache, they need to practice american restaurant practices & keep serving up until the advertised closing time not closing the kitchen 1/2 hr. before closing time!"}
{"text":"Didn't like the uncooked chicken and oily curry.  The roast duck curry was mainly fatty peice a and hardly enjoyable.  I did enjoy the yummy potstickers and iced Thai tea.  I wish I didn't have to feel concerned about getting sick.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"I don't eat here as often as I did last two years.
I always eat pad tai shrimp but the shrimp is now so small..
I once ordered for delivery and the driver went to wrong place (they said)
I had to wait one hour and 45 minutes and I got cold cold food 
and wet tempura (the shrimp appetizer thing)"}
{"text":"I usually like it here, but for the second time in a row now there was hair in my food. Not just one little tiny hair, but a long hair. I called to complain they weren't that apologetic. Disappointed and disgusted."}
{"text":"The bottom line: Just off the strip, almost at walking distance (unpleasant walking, that is...) is this small hole-in-the-wall shop that surprised us with authentic, friendly, tasty Thai food.

The Pros:  The food was as original as I remembered it from Thailand. The service was friendly and authentic. The place was packed with locals (as oppsed to us tourists). The price was more than fair.

The Cons: The location is a bit off the beaten path."}
{"text":"After being seated , it took our server 10 min. to take our drink order and this happened after I flagged him down.  After my family ordered everyone except my plate came out. They kept saying \" so sorry \" ! My family finished eating and I still don't have my plate ! As iam asking for the check , they finally bring out my food ! \" so sorry \" ! 
Si sorry for you Noodle House 3 ! Never going back again ! Lousy service !!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I found this place while on my first Vegas trip that was 3 years ago, every time I came here for vacation I made sure Noodle House was part of the activities. Now I live in Las Vegas and I come here so much our waitress who is so nice knows exactly what and how I like my dishes!!!!! I'm also vegetarian so I love that they have an extensive meat free menu. There food is amazing, Noodle House is the only stop for me when it comes to Thai food."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner back in September 2013. Everything we ordered came out very salty. (beef salad, shrimp tom yum soup, chicken satay, pad thai)."}
{"text":"Not a local.. first time here at this Thai restaurant. I was craving some type of soup and decided to get some Thai food. Their combination beef soup was really good. I prefer my soup spicy so I had to mix all the chili sauces together to get more flavor from my dish. (Just a personal preference.) What's nice about the noodles is that you get to choose the type of Noodle you want. Whether you want the fat noodles, small rice noodles, vermicelli noodles, or egg noodles. My fiance ordered their beef Thai fried rice and it wasn't too bad. It's not like the Thai fried rice we have had at other Thai restaurants. Everything on their menu sounds appetizing! What's best is that because it's so small... you know they're making it when you place the order. 

This is a small family owned business and the service they provide is pretty amazing. They don't check on you to see if there's anything else you need but they're attentive when you're looking for someone to assist you or need something. 

Their price point is pretty affordable. Obviously comparing the price with Thai restaurants on the strip is pretty outrageous but compared to Thai town in Hollywood, CA it's pretty inexpensive. Our bill for those two items was only $15.04... a pretty good bargain if you ask me! Especially since the food was good.. 

Can't go wrong with anything on this menu! Definitely recommend and would be back when we're back in town!"}
{"text":"This place is small and stuffy. Papaya salad portion is too small and not good.  Tom yum noodle is kind of sugar sweet which is awful. Fried salmon dish is also too sweet. Everything is too sweet. I will not recommend this place to anyone!  Worst Thai restaurant I've been to."}
{"text":"I was on my way home and I stopped at Smith's to pick up groceries, and in the parking lot I saw it.  The bright neon open sign was almost calling my name, that neon open sign knew I didn't want to go home and cook, it knew I wanted and needed fresh, fast, and quality Thai food. I ordered chicken Pad See Eu, OH MY!!! I was so good.  I soon invented reasons to be on that side of town to eat there, actually get take out from there.  As you read this review don't just think about going, experience it for yourself!!"}
{"text":"My favorite dish is Thai fried with chicken excellent quality of food for cheap. Every single dish is tasty and delicious.."}
{"text":"Went to Thai Style Noodle House tonight with my family and parents. We found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to leave our hotel at the MGM Grand for something new and less expensive.  I would have given this restaurant a 5 star if it weren't for the strange smell upon walking into the restaurant.  It may have been a spice or food related.  However, the food was excellent!  I had mongolian beef with rice and loved it.  My parents had the same and gave it a thumbs up as well.  Three others had variations of the pad thai noodles and said their food was really good. I recommend this place for good eating and saving money.  It's not fancy so don't go in expecting something formal.  The waitresses were attentive and the service was excellent.  The store front and restaurant itself are small.  But sometimes the best places are really the hole in the wall places like this restaurant."}
{"text":"Called for delivery. Friday night.... Soooo rude, the lady spoke almost no English, it was impossible for her to get our address right! WOWWWW
n I guess since they were closing at 10 and I called at 8:25 they did not want to deliver my food. 

they tried everything possible to NOT understand my order and then they said they had to charge me four dollars for delivery fee And the guy was insisting I pick up my order.  Then they hung up on me n my be.... Soooo

I called back after being hung up on n then they put me on hold for another 10 to 15 minutes. Is that how you treat YELPERS????
I won't n don't order from here they're very rude and they don't deserve your service and they will probably spit in your food when they do deliver your food finally after two hours. Mean horrible unprofessional. You won't be getting our 50$"}
{"text":"Great food been coming to this place for years, but the service and attitude from the workers are poor, especially the lady with the short hair, she made me feel like I am trying to scam her when I gave her  $10 bill and she was assuming it was counterfeit. while i have been coming to this establishment for years. I even stayed and waited while she took her time to look at this $10 bill, i asked her if everything is okay and her reply back to me was \"we'll find out\" with a dirty look as if im a crook. I told her i work a couple stores down and if there is any problem come look for me, but really?! It was a $10 bill meal. I understand it is important to check for counterfeits but the attitude following up with it was undeserving especially as I waited patiently for her to check, 
 If thai noodle house is reading this, this is eric, one of your regulars that orders from you guys at least 3-4 times a week."}
{"text":"We tried this because of the good YELP reviews. And they were right. The place is small and busy, but the food was really delicious and the service was spot on. The menu is very complete. This was an excellent choice for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is the Thailand in Sin City. Ask \"ling ling\" for the SERGE'S Special.

Red Curry + Basil Fried Rice Spicy! (8) with the Friend Chicken on TOP!"}
{"text":"I have to give it up to Misti Y. TSNH is the realness!! I have been looking for some good Thai food, so I decided I would try this place out after reading a lot of the stellar reviews on it. 

I will dare say that this place is the next best thing to eating in Thailand, & I know because I have been there more than a few times ;) 

I had the chicken noodle soup with a combo of flat & egg noodles, which is just as good as you can get from the best street vendors in Thailand! The broth was definitely very flavorful & they give you all the great condiments to go with it. The sliced peppers in vinegar are awesome! However, it could have used a little more sprouts, cilantro & green onions in the soup. That would be my only request :) 

That is the best part about the street vendors, everything on their carts are fresh & plentiful & you can add as much & whatever you like & as many noodle combinations as you want in your soup. 

My date du jour had the pineapple fried rice & from the look on her face & her comments, she really enjoyed it. After we finished the main course, we decided to split the fried bananas with ice cream & drizzled with honey. WOW!! That delicious little dish is what earned that 5th star :D 

I also ordered some pork chow mein to take home with me, cuz I gots to have my noodles! I F**K's with them noodles! I F**K's with them hard!! I have to say, it wasn't bad. 

Overall, I would totally recommend this place. The seating is pretty limited & close enough quarters that you can hear every ones conversations :P The decor is almost nonexistent, but who cares, it's a great little spot to enjoy some great food. The wait staff is outstanding in my opinion, very pleasant & helpful. I will definitely be a regular at this place & will not mind the 15-20 minute drive whatsoever ;)"}
{"text":"We have been there for three times, each time they just gave us less and less noodles in the soup, we had to order extra noodles.  Their beef noodle soup taste good, but the portion is so small my 3 year old can finish it in no time. The fried noodles is the same, small portion!  Won't go back again!"}
{"text":"So I went to this place and order the seafood soup and the fried calamari, this was the most disgusting tasting food I've ever tasted for it to be \"authentic\" I eat Thai food all over Vegas and this by far had to be the worst I won't ever recommend anyone to step foot in this shit in the wall place not only was the food bad but the service was worst when I explained I didn't like the food to ynu she was extremely unruly and unkind I again explained I wouldn't pay for a sip and a bite . She made a big scene and still took the food off the bill  my recommendations would be to stay away from this place 

The conditions are not well kept and the price for the crappy food they serve should be lowered. DO NOT COME HERE"}
{"text":"We were there with friends and with our kids. First they only had 2 high chairs so other 2 parents had to sit their kids in their strollers. Then a lady came took our order and our meal came out one at a time every 5 to 10 minutes later. Our food should have came out all together. But it didn't end there it seem they made a mistake with one of our order and it never came out so we ask them to cancel it because it seem they had  made a mistake and had not put in this order with the kitchen or wrong order was put in. This is when the fun begin, their server didnt even apologize and try to make us pay for the mistake when we told them to cancel it. The server said ok and we told them we will pay our bills. The cashier didnt give us our bill and just gave us a total amount (illegal) which we gave her our card. Then we realize the amount didnt add up so we asked for the bill there is when we found out they charge us for the cancel order and didn't want to show they charge it by not trying to show us our bills. So we had them void the last charge and charge the correct bill minus the cancel order. Still no apology and just yelling from the cashier. We will stop going to this place. The worst cashier in Las Vegas is here. This was one place we use to meet and eat."}
{"text":"Best orange chicken ever....not your usual big chunks. Small and crunchy....we had to get a second order! this is going to be a must for me and my family every time we come to vegas!"}
{"text":"The noodle house is a awesome venue. What a great selection good God Almighty if you don't leave out of here with a beer belly and a Joker like grin on your face after all the enjoyment that your taste buds will have given you on this day above ground, then you sir/ mam are an idiot.

At this moment have a food coma of happiness :)."}
{"text":"Went here once and ordered the Thai Style Noodle (I think that's what it was called lol) with a spicy level 3. It was so delicious and the spice level was just right for me. The portion was great for the price paid and I definitely want to come back and try other dishes!"}
{"text":"So much MSG, oil, and salt! We felt so gross afterwards that we immediately went to Smith's to stock up on fruits/veggies for a raw food/juicing diet. True story.

We ordered:
1) Duck Fried Rice--It was so salty! I felt like they poured in a cup of soy sauce and spoonfuls of msg into that dish. Don't get me wrong, our tastebuds were overjoyed from all the flavor. But is all that flavoring really necessary? I guess that's how some people like their food cooked though; it's just not for us. I think it would've been perfect had they just cut back on all the oil and soy sauce and even left out the msg.

2) Vegetable Stir-fry--Half of our stir-fry dish was made up with rice. They gave us the tiniest portion of vegetables. Like the fried rice, I felt like the stir-fry was just cooked in a ton of hoisin sauce/msg/soy sauce/salt.

3) Thai Iced Coffee--Too sweet! I think they added sugar on top of the condensed milk because that was the sweetest iced coffee I have ever had.

Service was decent. Even though we came at a busy hour, the waitresses were still attentive to us and quick with our orders.

Our total meal came out to be $22 including tax/tip."}
{"text":"Great food very authentic. Duck fried rice was very good. Tom yum soup was super good."}
{"text":"I've been here more than a couple times now and I have yet to be disappointed.
The staff is friendly and very helpful! Went with my boyfriend and he was curious of a plate another customer was enjoying, it was wonton soup, and it apparently also had spicy levels, the waitress explained the dish (we will be trying that on our next visit!)

My favorite here are the vegetarian egg rolls. 
It seems a bit plain but they are really on point! Crispy on the outside warm and delicious vegetable inside.  Another dish that I've enjoyed recently was the fried chicken over fried rice, the chicken was crispy and the proportions very extremely decent

I would definitely recommend anyone who wants a good filling meal!"}
{"text":"\"Sorry you got sweet and sour sauce so you can't have any soy sauce.\"

Wow.
What kind of place restricts condiments THIS MUCH?

We've been coming here for 3-4 years and the customer service has always sucked but the last couple visits have just been extra horrible.
It's not even just this instance, it's just kind of the last straw because of how ridiculous it is?

It's honestly disappointing to see that repeat customers will always be treated worse with each occurring visit :)

edit: we have frequented this place much more then my check ins would lead you to believe. 
There was a period of time that we went every other day. That's honestly why this is so upsetting.
Supporting a local business is good and all, but not when they run their business like this.

Good job saving that 2cents on the packet of soy sauce (we just wanted one or two lol)
And thanks for giving us the sweet and sour sauce spilled all over the bottom of the bag.
That was very mature of you :)"}

{"text":"I'm so glad this location opened! My roommate and I would always drive to the TSNH 2 which sometimes felt so far when we're both starving and craving the food lol. Now it's a minute away :) The food is delicious, the servers are always nice & polite, and the prices are unbelievably affordable."}
{"text":"the roasted duck soup with noodles is AWESOOMMMEEE!!! also the 3 kinds of pork is great to and Thia style BBQ pork is great as well. and the price is amazing too."}
{"text":"As a previous reviewer indicated, the restaurant is not much to look at from the outside.  However, the food was fantastic.  Having traveled the world, I rank this restaurant in my top 20.  The pricing was perfect, staff wonderful, and the food was phenomenal.   

When I return to Vegas, this will be a sure stop."}
{"text":"My wife and I loved it.  My Thai wife said this is excellent Thai food.  We went here multiple times to our visit to Las Vegas.  Excellent curry which is hard to find in the US.  We purchased food for the drive home and we wished we bought more."}
{"text":"I did not realize Vegas had such a great Thai place. It is Better than many Thai places in a los Angeles. We ordered Tom Yum Goong and Special House soup, Thai chicken with basil leaf, chicken fried rice and Chicken Chow Mein with Fish Cake. Every item exceeded expectation."}
{"text":"Yum! Yellow chicken pumpkin curry and the dumplings are delicious!! Staff is always friendly and I eat/order from here on a daily basis. The inside is cute too."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for takeout. Ordered then noticed \"C\" rating. Place has been in steady decline since opening. East side facing Windows have tint half scraped off as it was a year ago. And graffiti still on those windows. Sorry to say, this is the last time we patronize this place."}
{"text":"I dined here a month ago and I remember feeling confused why this place had such high reviews. I asked 8/10 \"hotness\" on my dish and I got it. The taste, however was just average. This is your typical Thai food; I felt like the dish was just \"going through the motions.\" The portions were smaller than what I'm used to getting from out of state Thai restaurants.

Pros: my dish was actually spicy
Cons: taste, portions, price"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. Can't beat the value. They also deliver to the hotel you are staying at (you need to meet them at the valet area)."}
{"text":"This place is great! Our GPS had us circling the block 3 times before we found it...... almost gave up, glad we didn't. The service was great and very friendly. The food was prepared so fast that we thought we had someone else's food. It was very fresh and flavorful. Had the Larb and Thai noodles....yummy. The Larb was some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I used to like coming here, until tonight. They rushed you and the lesbian that works there was so rude.  I will never come back here again"}
{"text":"Yelpers save the day again! The food here is great, for a good price. Me and my boyfriend had two very disappointing and expensive meals on the strip, and decided to venture off the drag for lunch.All of the positive feedback led us to a great meal at Thai Style Noodle House.

The staff is very friendly, and though you wouldn't come for the atmosphere, the food delivers all that yelpers promise!

It's not a Vegetarian restaurant but they will customize anything for veg-heads like me. I had the silver noodle salad and fried tofu and my boyfriend had the beef fried rice. We both loved our dishes, the food is fresh & flavorful. Some of the best flavored thai I've had in a minute and I'm from NY, but live in LA!"}
{"text":"So glad they opened one near my place. It was kind of a hassle to drive to Chinatown for my favorite Chicken Pad Thai, but now It's literally 5 minutes away. 
I still favor the original place to this one the cooking there seems better, but its still okay here.

I recommend you try the fried wontons too if you want a snack pretty good."}
{"text":"Food has gone bad. Waitress didn't even say sorry. Don't go this place.  You are going to be sick."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times. Not impressed.  Food don't taste the same like other locations. So salty!"}
{"text":"I would give them no stars if I could.  They had me wait 20 minutes before they told me that they forgot to put in my order.  But what they didn't forget was to ask me to pay first before forgetting to put in my order.  I was on my lunch break so i asked for my money back and had to go grab something else in a hurry.  They were not only unapologetic but tried to talk me out of canceling the order all together.   Just to add that they don't have call waiting so good luck trying to call ahead.  Needless to say that I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"Impressed with the food every time! There are a lot of options and the dishes can be made vegetarian/vegan! Will continue to eat here and I want to try take out as well. I ordered the Pad See Ew with tofu, vegan style! So delicious! Made with a soy sauce and broccoli. It was just under $7. I also ordered a side of steamed white rice. It was a decent portion for only $1.25. I recommend giving this Thai restaurant a try! They have two other locations as well but I haven't been to either one yet."}
{"text":"Best place for a bowl of thai noodle soup! The roasted duck fried rice is also delicious. Great service and very good prices"}
{"text":"Hi there! We were regular at this place until three years ago and returned last night after this long gap. We were so disappointed at the quality of service and food. The lady taking order was so much in a hurry and so rude! They have multiplied locations and deteriorated in quality ! The food was so horrible that We will never return and never recommend  any one. Food had no flavour and meat was not even thawed properly ! We could not finish what we ordered!"}
{"text":"Love this little joint - especially since it's within walking distance from our neighborhood. 

 The food is fantastic. The service is great. The entire staff has always been friendly and helpful. We've tried a variety of dishes and they've all been tasty - including the Currys. The only caveat, is to be clear on your spice level."}
{"text":"NEVER DISAPPOINTS!!!!! Not only is the food terrific, the customer service and staff are the best.  If you are not a regular yet, once you go you will be part of the family."}
{"text":"Everyone here at Noodle House is awesome.
We are always happy to come and dine here the food is great and the service also. I always come for Thai Tea"}
{"text":"If you love authentic Thai food! The curry chicken is unbelievable and you can order the heat from one to ten. I get a 6 heat level and it's perfect must try the following - you won't be disappointed. Fried Chicken over house fried rice. To die for! Pad Thai Noodles, Thai Tea and Tom-Kha ( coconut noodle soup). The chef specials Crispy Pork with Broccoli and MA Kuer Song Kran. We go to the Wynn location in China Town. The place only seats about 12 tables, no reservations and cash only. The portions are HUGE and the prices are very low for the quality of food you get. Give this place a try! You'll be hooked! We go twice a week now. Weekends get busy so know what you're going to order before you go and place your order right away. Everything is cooked to order and the yellow curry is the best I've ever had! Bon Apetit"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner Saturday night. I have been here a number of times and the food is consistently good and reasonably priced. We initially tried to go to Lotus of Siam, which is our favorite, but didn't want to wait 45 minutes to eat so we kept going to Thai Noodle. The location is small with maybe ten tables or so. Service is good. I had the Panang salmon avocado which came with rice, I think it was around $10. Ordered it medium spicy, which was really not spicy for me, but it was delicious. I wouldn't initially think hot avocado as something I would like but it works really well in this dish.  I love that they give you a lot of sauce to because I like soaking the sauce up with the rice. Also, the salmon was a pretty decent size, 3 pieces maybe 1 1/2 inches by 3 inches or so, I was very full by the time we were done. We also had the combo appetizer platter, the satay was good and the food on the app was tasty but most of it was fried so I probably would opt for the pot stickers next time. If you are looking for a good Lotus alternative I would definitely keep this in mind."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times now. Both as dine in and take out. We have also frequented the Thai Noodle House on Wynn Road, but once we found out this was the same one but in the northwest we go here all the time. The prices are very reasonable ($8 or so a dish) and the flavor is the same. 

The decor at this location is much more modern and nicer than the original one in China Town i.e. this is casual date appropriate whereas the location in Chinatown would strike me more as meeting up with friends after having a few beers. Service has always been prompt and the food comes out quick. It has never been busy when we are here but I think that may just be lack of knowledge of this location. Which is good and bad, I like that it is not crowded and it is quiet but conversely I really want them to stay in business.  

I have tried quite a few things, but I always circle back to the Avocado and Salmon Panang. I love that they give a lot of sauce, because I like using my rice to sop up all the sauce and there is plenty to go around. I also get the duck curry quite often, but what can I say duck is almost always good. I always get the Thom Kai (same as Thom Kha Ka - please forgive me if I am not spelling this correctly). The meat, even the chicken, is tender - often times at other places, even at my favorite Lotus of Siam, the chicken is dry, more than likely from boiling the chicken in the broth, but I haven't had that experience here. 

This is a million times better than most cheap chinese places and the same cost as the prices are very reasonable. Although don't get me wrong, cheap chinese has its place in my little world too.  Not to mention they are in the same center as the German Bread Bakery - so if you time it right you could go to both and get morning pastries for the next day too!"}
{"text":"Good things about this place.
1. Food is good.
2. Car park is 10 meters away.
3. Low prices."}
{"text":"this is mine and my sisters favorite spot to go to if you like thai food this is the place to go. Great staff.. Great food. Very small place, but it doesn't bother me. They are kid freindly and their thai tea is one of the best i tried.I will most def. come back here again."}
{"text":"Omg!! The best Tom yum noodle soup in Vegas!!! I am addicted to it!! Have to come here at least twice a week!!! Good food and it so cheap!"}
{"text":"This place was yummy! I'm always on the lookout for great Thai food, I feel like there are a lot of just mediocre places around Vegas. I randomly came across it online and saw that it was extremely close to my house so gave it a shot. I'm glad I did! I got food to go so can't review the dine in experience, though all the people I dealt with were very friendly. I got the green papaya salad which was delicious but VERY spicy. I usually get a 7 and did that here also. I'd say their 7 is most other places 10! I also got the panang avocado curry with shrimp. This was totally delicious and while still very spicy it was closer to what I  would consider a 7. (I am not a wuss when it comes to spice but my tummy was a'gurgling after this meal!) I will be going back for more soon now that I know it's in my neighborhood...but perhaps scaling back my spice number for once!"}
{"text":"I usually eat here so it pains me to write this. I just picked up my favorite pod won sen and mango sticky rice. The pod won sen tasted dry and overcooked which wasn't terrible but a little annoying. I was so excited about the mango sticky rice but the mango was all dry and rotted inside and I ate half of it before noticing it. So now I feel sick and gross.  Maybe one should not eat cheap Thai food :/"}
{"text":"Bugs!!!! Once I saw it I was quiet to not scare the other customers. Later I asked to refill my drink and she gave me an attitude.  I could have made a scene but didn't. And they didn't give discount on the food. Never again will I come back."}
{"text":"WARNING! DO NOT EVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!
The lady that takes their orders need to be replaced... I ordered a chicken thai basil leaf ala cart for dinner which she repeat to me and when I picked up my order and got home...SUPRISE SUPRISE  they gave me a lunch menu(during dinner time)... called them back for a refund all they can give me is a store credit. After this event do they actually think I'm gonna go back for this business..."}
{"text":"We order from this place all of the time. I've had their Seafood Combo Tom Yum, the Sliced Beef Soup, the Beef Combo Soup, Fried Chicken Over Fried Rice, and now their Duck Soup. Everything is great."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, and I've had authentic Thai soup (not featured in any menu) before made by chefs and went crazy because how delicious it was.

At first, I thought the soup was good but as I kept on eating I felt the soups we ordered (duck noodle and beef noodle) were a little too sweet for my taste. Usually Thai food comes with the seasoning sides, I prefer pickled Thai chillies than jalapeños (that's what they serve). 

Service was slow. Our friend, who paid for the check, had to walk up to the server while she was eating asked for refills and if we could order more noodles lol."}
{"text":"Such good Thai food and affordable too. Of course the pad thai is a classic and was delicious but we particularly loved the house tom yum!"}
{"text":"As a local, I love it when I find places like this around town. I came here for the first time tonight, and the food was great! Location-wise, it's a little hole in the wall place across the street from 99 Ranch Market. The prices were just right - I ordered the pork pad see ew and it was $6.95. There were five of us in our group, and our total bill was around $45, a great deal! I give this place 4/5 stars because the service wasn't totally top notch, we only got our drinks refilled at the end of our meal, and our waitress only checked on us once. If it were busy, I would have easily forgiven that, but it wasn't busy at all, so I think checking on us a couple times couldn't have hurt."}
{"text":"No onions on the cashew nut chicken! This place is good but it is so tiny. They seat you next to people so close. But the food is awesome so it makes up for it. It is authentic Thai food. They have a wide variety of dishes are really affordable prices."}
{"text":"Update The last few times I went the quality has gone down by a lot. I ordered Thai fried rice and it was pretty gross.Then I ordered Yellow chicken curry and the rice was crunchy and gross. I used to adore this place, but now I don't trust the food is fresh. Such a shame I literally ate there every weekend, but now I will never go back. I always read updated reviews because I realize restaurants can start to get lazy or staff changes and I never want to be a victim of poor quality food so I hope this review saves you from dissapointment."}
{"text":"Great food, very cheap and only five minutes in a cab from the wynn casino. It is great for lunch and to get away from the fast food chains and expensive restraunts on the strip, would definitely recomend."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since Dec 2009.  Shame on me for not doing a review sooner.  This is my favorite spot for their yummy chicken tom yum goung (sp?) soup with small noodles.  My mouth is salivating just thinking about it!  I've tried their crab fried rice, pad thai, duck fried rice, fried chicken wings, papaya salad and curries and they have all been good.  They do tend to get really busy around noon, so keep that in mind.  Other than that, good food for cheap prices, this place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I am a fan this place was very good, the thai ice tea was good i had the shrimp pad thai the shrimp was not very fresh, but over all the food was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place here on yelp and my wife and I love it! Great food, but I've only had the Duck Curry because I'm hooked on it! My wife has had several noodle dishes and has loved them all...great place!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food places I've eaten by far. The atmosphere is nothing to brag about and you can only seat about 20 people inside but the food is phenomenal! The pricing is cheap and they give you very good sized portions. Highly recommend! You won't be dissappointed."}
{"text":"Really good little Thai place. Limited seating. Their food is always good and quick. It's hidden in a corner and worth the find. Some of the best Thai Tea around. I'd recommend their Pad See Ew Chicken or Fried Chicken and rice."}
{"text":"I've been to all their locations and this one is my favorite. The food is authentic tasting and prices are really good. Food also comes out pretty fast."}
{"text":"Amazing! Go here. Try everything! Incredible food. Large portions. Low prices. Excellent Thai Iced Coffee and Iced Tea!"}
{"text":"This is a small family business, affordable,  with delicious curry. The  green curry  I ordered  made it worth the time spending trying to  find a parking space during the lunch rush hour.   I  wish I had time to visit and try another dish. The Pad Thai was  not to my taste."}
{"text":"I have only found Thai food that comes close to the Noodle House. Simply, its authentic, delicious, and flavorful. Their noodles and rice are incredible. Order the potstickers-they are a must!"}
{"text":"Almost missed it as I drove by. Phone ordered for take out. Got the Duck fried rice and calamari. Good prices, great flavor not too greasy. Happy tummy."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue I'm pretty much a regular. love this place everything is good and trust me I've almost tried everything in the menu. some of my favorites beef pad seew and Panag  Curry it's just Yum!"}
{"text":"The service was horrible, my family got sick, and the place was very unkept. Someone need to call the health department ASAP. Oh P.S their tom yum is nasty don't ever order that."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for the first time and I have to say; I love it! I've never had a single Thai place that I preferred but now I have a favorite!

The food was excellent with generous portions and a price that was unbelievably cheap. The atmosphere was comfy and spacious with very polite workers, they even enjoy getting to know you and talk to you, I felt absolutely welcomed!"}
{"text":"I live just several blocks from here well within walking distance for me, About 1.5 Miles west of Strip in Chinatown area on Spring Mountain Rd. for tourists. For me it's a stop by place every once in awhile for lunch or early dinner, I generally have enough to take home for another meal. It's a neighbothood restaurant in Chinatown and that's what you get in terms of ambiance. In terms of Quality they are alwys respectful, cheerful and though tend to be more businesslike than friendly they do an excellant job. The food is not gourmet nor are the prices. you get what you pay for. I have never had a bad experience here. If you want or require a strict vegetarian diet and desire Oriental fare, certainly you can rely on them."}
{"text":"I always go to Thai noodle house and order food to-go. Usually the same thing beef pad Thai spicy #8, but this time they got my order wrong. After they were the ones that made the mistake they expected me to drive all the way back to their location and exchange for the correct item. I work in food and what we usually do is credit the item for the customer but instead they just kept giving attitude over the phone and eventually hung up on me"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I usually goto the other locations near my house and the food is always fresh and service is pretty consistent, so this review is solely for this location near the strip. Took my friend who was visiting from Cali here for a quick bite, since I thought the food quality would be the same but I guess I was wrong. I ordered the BBQ pork wonton soup and the wontons had a sour taste to them which were not mild, and made me think they may be expired. Broth was extremely red, probably due to the BBQ pork coloring, but at the other locations the broth is always brown and if anything, a hint of red; never would the entire soup be overpowered with a red color...In addition, the papaya salad was made with ripened papaya. When I say this, I mean that the papaya salad came out orange, instead of the bright green color. No it was not from the fish sauce, or because it may have been made laos style, it was because the papaya was ripe. It made the salad have a different soft texture and also added a sweet flavor to it which was not like the usual Thai style green papaya salad. Only time the waiter came by was to take our order, drop the food off, and give the check. No water refills or checking to see how the food was, probably because they didn't care and I could see it in the quality of the dishes."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place is sooo good... I know I should've written this right when I tried it but in my defense it was a long drive. But take my word this spot is like walking into your Thai granny mammas kitchen and boy is it yummy no let me say its 
A-MAAAA-ZIIIING!!! full of flavor please come here and you'll see just what I mean."}
{"text":"Some friends and I decided to check this place out due to the good ratings. We ordered chicken larb, green curry, and 2 noodle bowls. The prices are great, and the food we had was too. I loved my beef noodle bowl, just the right amount of spice i asked for. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great thai food at really affordable prices! Can't go wrong here my new spot for some really great soups and noodles."}
{"text":"Whether it's eat in or food to take out and eat at home this place is great!
From the Thai fried rice to the chicken noodle soup, yep Thai version, the flavors are on point! 
I've eaten from this restaurant for many years and it's always consistently delish!
Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly! The food was fast, fresh and yummy! We got chicken satay, chicken yellow curry, and duck fried rice. We were in and out in under 30 min. Parking was easy to find. Great dive!"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, friendly services and good portion size. The pot stickers were sooooooooo good."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I finally found a perfect Thai restaurant near summerlin area. Awesome food, clean and good service!!!!  Oh did I mentioned good $????"}
{"text":"The food is awesome. The pad Thai dish is my favorite. Get it wig he pork. All the Thai noodle dishes are great too. Especially if you like spicy. The service is great. Just wish they would get a bigger place. They're very popular."}
{"text":"First off, loyal customers and fans of this place. I never thought I would 1 star this restaurant, it was my favorite place just before what you're about to read, I swear! 
But just as I would go to a restaurant with mediocre food and great service, I will not support a restaurant with good food and horrible service. PLEASE, be non bias when reading, thanks.
Ordered a few panang curries and 2 noodle items, carryout. The panang curries were very watered down and tasted like it, usually it's perfect and that's why we ordered there so often. But hey mistakes happen, no biggie right, right.
So... We called... They asked us to drive back the food, for replacements. At first I didnt want to call, because it was 10 minutes there and then 10 minutes back and the rest of the food not messed up would be cold returning home. But I called because every restaurant deserves a chance to correct their mistake. So I called, they told us if we drove the food back they would have our replacements. So I went, because hey, that's $25 of food I paid for and 20 min to get what I paid for right? 
No problem I guess, seemed like an easy fix even tho it took an extra trip, but that's NOT what they did. 
I walked in and the management immediately, let me say again, \"immediately\" got angry and raised thier voices at me. I was shocked, thrown off and confused. I thought I was just picking up replacements of a few mess ups as I brought the food back like I was told. Walking into a place I go to on a regular and then getting yelled at for something I had no control over (food mistakes).
So I cut off both of them yelling at me, and asked them questions. 
I asked why they were mad at me for the mistakes they see and admitted to, no reply from either manager. I asked why would they yell at me, a regular customer, after I drove back and brought back the food as asked. Again no response.
THIS IS WHERE THE 1 STAR KICKS IN FOR SURE.
They didn't replace the mistakes they made, right they said they would over the phone. Even seeing it for themselves first hand. 
They had us drive back there then changed the offer to, remaking 1 of 3. WOW, really? 
Not only did I have to wait for the 1 of 3 to be remade, I paid for 3 and got 1 remake (that's not what I was told on the phone), I had to drive back there and waste my time, returned home to 2 cold noodle dishes that are supposed to be served hot.
Returning home to the cold noodles and 4 hungry friends/coworkers. I walked in feeling frustrated and still confused to why they did that to me, why they got mad at me, the customer. My friends suggested yelp after I explained what had happemed. They said they will back up the yelp, as they were let down on their first experience with the restaurant. 
SORRY thai style noodle house, but I've never in my life experienced such rude and disrespectful behavior from a business I truly once enjoyed."}
{"text":"The pad Thai is very flavorful. All the prices are pretty reasonable especially for how much food you get. Off the beaten path but worth a try."}
{"text":"This place is good. The fried rice is bomb! The delivery time was quick. I have only tried a few things, but I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"Was ok for a brunch from late night partying... Portions were really small.. Good service tho.."}
{"text":"They must been having a bad day or something.  The green curry with chicken was very oily, was missing eggplant, and had raw green beans.  Also, the sweet rice side was really dry and hard.  The only thing really got right was the spice in the curry.  How do you serve raw green beans?"}
{"text":"Great food! Be careful not to order too spicy!

I enjoy eating here. You can get a great meal for under 30 dollars for three"}
{"text":"We have been eating at this place for the past 5 months at least twice a week sometimes more. Tonight we placed of order and waited at least 30 mins. before we started to get our food. I got mine, dad got his about 5 mins. later (part of it anyways) and Sas got hers 10 mins. after dad. Meanwhile we saw at least 7 to go orders come in after us and ordered and leave with their food before ours. The waitress didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. Last time we will be dining there. Word of advise to others that don't want to waste your time waiting. Go some where else. We are !!"}
{"text":"My mother took me here for my birthday since we were in the Chinatown area. We came expecting the same great service. Well, our experience was truly horrible. The server that we had was not the one we were used to. Initially, she was helpful despite the language barrier. When our dishes arrived, it was not what my mother indicated to her. She then became defensive and stated that it wasn't her fault that my mother did not accurately specify what she wanted. 

Mom sent back the soup which she never touched and the server gave her a hard time. The server never came back afterwards to ask us if everything was okay. In fact, it was the crew member who brought my mother the redone soup and gave us the same \"it's not our fault speech\" when we asked her questions. Mom told me that the soup did not taste like what she had the last time that she went. She suspects that it was the same soup with different garnishes.

The salad that I ordered tasted fresh and fine, but was missing ingredients that I am used to seeing such as galangal, lemongrass and thai chilies. Instead, I got a sliver of jalapeno pepper and saw that they use bottled lemon juice in the kitchen. In other words, they are charging the same prices, while shortchanging the customer on authenticity. FYI, they do not make their curries in house; they use a curry mix as per their own admission.

I was going to order dessert, but changed my mind after the latter. When it came time to check out, the server ignored me refused to give me the ticket. As a matter of fact, she looked angry and had a stone face while looking sideways. The crew member was the one who checked us out and tried to diffuse the tension. We did nothing to deserve such undignified treatment.

Consequently, we left no tip and will never ever be back there!"}
{"text":"My client and I took a shot in the dark on this place being we never had or heard of it. But it was top notch! I had the yellow chicken curry with rice level 5 spicy! REALLY good. I'd recommend it and I'll definitely be back! Plus great customer service! Thank you guys"}
{"text":"I just moved close to this place so I gave it a try. Got the shrimp and chicken nooddle. Omg it really was delicious! Everything looked fresh, vegetables crunchy and perfectly tasty. Also very cheap!! Will def try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I've recently returned here, after have a very good experience, only to be let down. I came in for lunch and ordered the Pad Thai, like last time. The seafood tasted old, and on top of that the service was slow and lackadaisical. There were probably only three other people there. 

They need to step it up and stick to their standards. I had a very good first impression of this place, now its barely mediocre."}
{"text":"The staff here are so friendly and the food is legit Thai. They are always willing to go the extra mile. What a wonderful place!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan and probably will not return. 
The food didn't seem fresh. I've had thai basil leaf/spicy basil from almost 30 different places and this was the first time I've heard of string beans in this entree however I didn't think I'd mind since it's typically one of my favorite vegetables, but not this time; they tasted dry and dehydrated as if they were old and reused.  Half of the entree box was the entree [mostly vegetables, little meat (this is coming from a light meat eater)] and the other half was overloaded with rice. 
On the other hand they had a sign regarding a minimum spend requirement to use a credit card, but they still allowed me to use my card without a fee (at least I didn't see one snuck in there) which I appreciated.
Hope others have a better food experience than I did."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch on a Friday with my friend. There were plenty of parking spaces. When I walked in I was pleasantly surprised how nicely decorated this restaurant is. We were sat down immediately by a very friendly waitress. We told her we were new to this restaurant and asked her what she recommended, she said I'll be right back. We waited and waited and she never came back. After 10 minutes we were able to waive down another waitress. We asked her what is the best Curry they have and she said there's no best Curry, just order what you like. Omg. We ordered green curry with shrimp, Thai ice tea and spicy Thai noodle with chicken. 20 minutes later they brought our Curry out, it was delicious.  We waited for another 15 minutes and our other dish still did not come out. 25 minutes later they brought out the spicy noodle dish, that was also delicious. I'm giving the food there 5 stars and the slow service brought it down to 3 stars. Please hire more servers, two are not enough for your lunch rush. I will definitely come back for the food and hopefully there will be more servers hired."}
{"text":"The best Chinese and Thai food in Chinatown I don't care who you are. I would take anybody there who loves real and really great Chinese and Thai curry."}
{"text":"A very nice small restaurant. Pretty decor and spotlessly clean. Everything we have tried has been good. Lunch specials today. Mint chicken and sweet and sour pork, beef broccoli and Penang curry. You get soup, starter and 2 main dishes for $7.95. Amazing value."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Cheap, Clean & food is very goood.  Try the Tom Ka Gai, Thai Chicken Soup with Coconut and Lemongrass.  And for dessert: fried ice cream."}
{"text":"By far the worst chicken noodle soup I have ever had in my life. The chicken didn't even look natural.. It was in like balled up chucks and the oily water broth tasted only of onion. I took 1 bite and was done."}
{"text":"Great food, great service I recommend the yellow curry and Kung Pao Chicken at Spicy level 8. Great taste!"}
{"text":"Went to Thailand 1 month ago, this is the most authentic place ive been in Vegas. Very good!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and my review reflects all of the visits, but will focus on my most recent visit. 

We were not welcomed when we walked in. I've made eye contact with at least two employees by the kitchen but no one made the attempt to sit us or even say hello to us while we were just standing around the entrance waiting to be seated until at least a minute later. 

However, when we were seated and ready to order, the older lady was very kind in taking our orders. 

The food came out pretty timely and reasonably delicious for the price that they offer. 

I will continue to use this place when I crave Thai food. I just hope that their customer service gets better."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend order two thai iced teas and we both got curry, mine with shrimp. The bill was 20$!! Such a good deal. The food portions were good size and also really delicious. Its kind a hole in the wall but definitely worth checking out and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner. It is a small inexpensive restaurant in a strip mall. The general area is packed with Asian food joints and looked like they were frequented by locals. We ordered two entrees - Vegetable Green Curry and Vegetable and Tofu Drunken noodles. We asked for a 7/10 spice rating. Both dishes came piping hot and were excellent.The spice level was just right for us. This place compares better than most Thai places i have visited for taste. Note that the prices are very affordable but be prepared for a very simple ambiance. Service was satisfactory. I parked across the street in another larger strip mall."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch with my family. There were plenty of parking spaces. When I walked in I was pleasantly surprised how nicely decorated this restaurant is. We were sat down immediately. About 5 minutes the waitress brought water for us, and I asked if we can order, she replied with a bad attitude, it seemed like she was very angry. I don't know her name, but she had short hair and a tattoo on her arm. Unprofessional waitress, bad service. The food was delicious. I'm giving the food there 3 stars and the service brought it down to 0 stars. Please hire more servers, two are not enough for your lunch rush. I will never come back for the bad service."}
{"text":"Best boat noodle in vegas! Not sure if it's affiliated with any of the other locations but the food at this one was the best. I've been looking for a place with authentic beef noodle here for years and this place is just amazing. I will be returning."}
{"text":"I got the pineapple fried rice as it was recommended so highly on yelp. It came out so tasty! It comes with a boat load of pineapple, a lot of chicken strips, and some shrimp. It also comes on a longer plate so that it's enough for two meals. Definitely worth coming here!!"}
{"text":"Small hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant with big and delicious dishes.  My wife and I tried pad thai, tom yum noodle soup, and papaya salad.  All of them were good.  Just like the other reviewer said, if you do not plan to \"shit fire\", do not ask for spicy dishes.  We asked for \"medium\" papaya salad and we were almost crying while eating it.  But man... was it tasty!

We decided to come back the next day to try some other dishes.  This time we had Three Companion (grilled chicken with sticky rice and papaya salad on the side), and fried chicken over fried rice, and more pad thai.  I didn't care for the sticky rice, but the grilled chicken was delicious.  High marks for the fried chicken over fried rice as well.  As a bonus, on the to-go menu, there is a coupon for free appetizer combo (egg rolls, fried wonton, and fried tofu) for purchase over $20.  They are not very good, but hey... they are free!

Overall, good place and we'll definitely go back when we are back in Vegas.  Most dishes are between $6-$7, which is right on our budget."}
{"text":"Great place.  I've eaten Thai all over and this is both great food and a great value.  Terrifically helpful staff, no intimidation factor, just fun, tasty, genuine."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and I've always wanted to give them five stars, but recently I've been back a few times and I've got to say, their business is going down to me. I remember when there would be a line around the corner of the restaurant, now you can just walk in and choose from the many table available. This place has NEVER had good service, they want you to come in, eat quickly and leave. But people didn't care because the food WAS really good. WAS. There special potstickers are amazing because there are no other restaurants that can emulate it and it's one dish that is still decent. However, I used to come here all the time for Duck Fried Rice and Duck Noodle Soup, but every time I come back, the quality of the duck is terrible and it keeps getting worst. The duck used to be super moist and delicious to eat, but now its super hard, dry and tough to eat and it really takes away from the whole dish itself. Now, I also stopped by to order a Shrimp Fried Rice togo and I was disappointed to open the box that wasn't even half full.....I paid full price for not even half a dish. Not only was it half empty, but there was only 4 shrimps. This place has terrible service, but the food is the only thing that gets people to come back, if the quality of the food keeps going down, people are gonna stop coming. It's a shame because they have very unique recipes for their food, they should do these recipes some justice and make them correctly will fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Charming and common, if you're looking for a cheap Thai meal this is place to go. Allow a few extra minutes for seating and be sure to avoid the lunch rush. 

Parking can be tedious as well, but patrons are respectable to the lines. 

Today's cuisine pick: Khua-Kai Rice Noodle"}
{"text":"Top of the world..tastiest yellow curry I have ever eaten...Kung pao chicken was out of the world too."}
{"text":"Love the food, huge portions and very reasonable prices.. They accept card payments. I'm very satisfied!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. The service was ok. To start they had no lemon for my tea but the appetizer, shrimp rolls, were delicious. The chicken noodle soup was very good. I would return  and recommend this restaurant  to my friends."}
{"text":"So I've been to this place a few times. I'm usually not one to write bad yelp reviews because I know it can hurt the business. But I'm going to be honest, this place is not worth your time. The food wasn't that great and one of the employees who may have been a manager, I'm not really sure was very passive aggressive to me. My soup came with like barely any broth and I just asked for some more. I mean I did order soup after all. Not noodles with duck thrown on it which is pretty much what it looked like. She told me that she doesn't do that here. I was confused and asked why and showed her that there was barely any broth and she didn't care and walked away. So I just poored my water in it which didn't help much. My bfs curry was really bland these people just seem like they don't give a crap about their customers."}
{"text":"Their other reviews are so good, maybe I came on a bad night.  But between us we ordered 2 salads and 2 entrees and only 1 of the 4 dishes was good.
We started with the Papaya Salad and Grilled Beef Salad.  The Papaya Salad was mediocre at best, but the Beef Salad was fantastic.  Bright, fresh flavors in the dressing and a nice char on the beef.
For entrees we had Duck Pad See Eu and Snapper Pad Ped Snapper.  The noodle dish was awful.  We each only took 1 bite.  It had a funny taste that in retrospect should have prompted me to send it back.  There was just something wrong, like old meat or oil that had me repulsed.
The fish itself was light and flaky inside, but the coating was a soggy mess.  It had been fried, then tossed in sauce, but the fried coating wasn't crispy enough so it just ended up with an almost gooey texture that was very unpleasant.
Service was good, but our salads didn't come out at the same time, then the entrees came within just a few minutes of getting the last salad."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Large portions at affordable prices.  Very casual - not much ambiance.  Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai Place. The service is great. The food is only good when the old woman is cooking. I never go when there is a new cook. But the environment is chilled, it's kinda small but it's a great place if your looking for a place to have lunch."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite go to places in the southwest. I order takeout at least once a week! They are consistently delicious! My favorites are Penang curry, spicy eggplant and seafood wonton soup. The noodle dishes are always great too."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas. They have multiple locations around the valley but this is the location we go to every single time because of one factor; their customer service. 
Nok is our waitress on a regular and we've started to go only when we know she'll be working. If we see that's she's not working then we get back in our car and try again another day...she's just that good of a waitress. There isn't a single time that she hasn't made us feel like family and we love how she always makes sure the food is to our liking before leaving our table. We've noticed that other regulars prefer her to be their waitress as well because she makes friends with everyone and always provides excellent service. There honestly isn't enough great things I could say about her, so when you go make sure you scout out the lady with short hair and a tattoo on her arm, that's Nok! :)
Also, the food is great too"}
{"text":"Good foods  and affordable price, the restaurant is clean too, the food  , the only problem was the server, i dont know her name but she has short and black hair she always rude . I dont know because her personality but she needs more sincere to the costumers"}
{"text":"Great hole-in-the-wall! No atmosphere but terrific food!"}
{"text":"So I went in with my 3 kids and we been before I dnt know what happened this time we order our usually sticky rice n beef jerky and it sucked so bad the sticky rice was a disgrace it crumbled in our hands from being to wet or I dnt know what I couldn't eat my 3 hungry kids try to eat they crumbled everywhere as it was falling from there hands and it's suppose to be a hand meal I asked the worker she said supposed to be like that then 15 minutes later she tried to bring a new one when I ordered 4 witch it came out after the beef jerky at different times.....and said this one is free I said dnt worry it was insulting the rice was unedible we left hungry....."}
{"text":"The orange chicken: TO DIE FOR! But before your main meal, the pot stickers are a must as well. The price is amazing for the amount of food you get. Not one thing we ordered was a disappointment. I love seeking out Thai food and I am extremely glad we found this one. The waiter ran the whole room and never did my glass of water get past halfway before he was filling it up again!!! A MUST!"}
{"text":"we liked it so much we went three days in a row....but be careful if you order your food spicy as it can be very very hot"}
{"text":"Casual and clean restaurant in a strip mall.  The prices are VERY reasonable with most items under $9.  Portions were good and service efficient.  We tried the pad thai and beef noodle soup.  Both were very tasty and better than any other Thai restaurant I've tried in Las Vegas.  The beef noodle soup was excellent.  Tastiest I've had in a long time and you get to set the heat level.  This is my new go to noodle place."}
{"text":"Solid, Solid, excellent Thai food! You won't go wrong ordering anything here, everything is cheap, just as Thai food is meant to be. In Thailand these most of the menu items are considered street food/snacks, and prices reflect as such.

Our Lyft driver asked what Thai restaurant we were going to and I mentioned Thai Style and he gave us the thumbs up. If it's good enough for locals, you know it's gotta be good!

The spiciness level is on a scale of 1 - 10 and let me tell you, I can take a lot of heat, and my mouth was tingling at 6. Heed caution when choosing your level of spice!

We ordered the following:
Vegetarian Egg Rolls           $4.95
Papaya Salad                      $6.50
Fried Chicken over Fried Rice   $6.95
Chicken Pad Thai                $6.95 
2x Thai Ice Tea                   $1.95 each

I've never heard of Fried Chicken of fried rice but this dish was simply exceptional! Seasoned, lean cutlets of chicken breast lightly deep fried, had a crisp crunchy outer shell. The fried rice was well seasoned all around, had bits of carrots, onions, peas, green onions, and scrambled eggs. The Pad Thai was delicious, a generous plateful of slippery rice noodles with the perfect blend of sauce and heat. I really appreciated the large side of bean sprouts, so that you can add as much and as little as you like.

It's a very family run place, the tables were all full during lunch service on a Wednesday, with a heavy flow of take-out orders.

They had some specials on their board that I definitely have to try for the next time, the one that comes to mind is Crispy Pork with Chinese Broccoli :oP

Bottom line: amazing, flavorful Thai food, served the way it was meant to at the price sure to appease everyone!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their curry with pumpkin is awesome, and I also love the duck fried rice."}
{"text":"Ok I was totally craving Thai food, especially since I haven't had any in 4 months. But we have been really scared to try any on Spring Mountain since they all look the same and we've been hurt before. =( 

Anyways, so yes, this is a hole in the wall, but it smells wonderful when you enter so we sit. Now in order to makesure we like something they bring us,  we order a ton of food like crazy. MAJOR NOTE: WHEN YOU SAY SPICY, THEY HEAR BURN BUTT SPICY. ORDER SPICY CAUTIOUSLY. 

1. Potstickers - Pretty good, although a little salty. 
2. BBQ Pork Wonton Soup - Very tasty, surprisingly our favorite. 
3. Mongolian Beef - Good, sauce was a little runny and light flavor, but essentially good. 
4. Orange Chicken - flavor good, but more batter than chicken, although it is really cheap so we really can't complain too much. 
5. Spicy Basil Leaf - This is a version of my favorite dish, called other places Chili Mint chicken. At first it was so salty I couldn't eat it, but then I poured 1/2 a cup of the broth from our soup over the dish and it was perfect!! 
6. Fried Banana's and vanilla ice cream - very yummy. 

So all of this food plus 3 Sprites cost us a whopping $44.00, and mind you the dish sizes were huge, most of the plates were still full. 

So all in all, a great hole in the wall Thai place, even though the chef is very heavy handed with the salt and chili."}
{"text":"My all time favorite when im in town. Hidden gem!! This is usually my last stop before heading home. Don't need to say much. Everything on the menu is good and authentic. Prices are cheaper than other Thai places and food is better. Why would you even go to other places??
I usually order either duck fried rice or green curry with pork. Sometime I even order another duck fried rice to go to bring back to LA, hehe.
Spicy fried rice is also good. I feel like there's this special taste in all their fried rices that makes it better than others, but I just can't figure out what it is."}
{"text":"Omg pad kee mau is great here. Affordable, small but plenty of seats. The server may have forgotten I existed but nothing was late or wrong. There was just no fawning. For the price and quality of the food, who cares?

XLNT"}
{"text":"I stopped by here with some friends yesterday. 

They ordered Phad Thai and I had Pad Se Ew(sp?). 

The prices were very reasonable considering the portions and the food was good.

While this location may not make a top 10 list, it is absolutely worth a visit if you are in the neighborhood and feel like some Thai on the cheap.

I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"A new favorite Thai food place for me in Vegas.  Ordered the BBQ pork fried rice, glass noodle salad, pork and fish ball soup with vermicelli, and large Thai iced tea and large coconut juice for the misses.  

First off the large drinks come in a large stein glass.  The size you should get since its so freaking hot out in the desert.  You will be hydrated once you finish the large drink.  

The fried rice is soft and flavorful.  Not dry like other places.  Hight recommend you guy to try it out.  They don't skimp on the BBQ pork.  Glass noodle salad was spot on.  Had ground pork and shrimp mixed with romain lettuce, shredded carrots, red onions all mixed in the Thai lime juice.  A very colorful dish.  Lastly the pork and fish ball soup was very simple.  Sometimes it's tough to keep a dish simple, but the dish tasted very homemade.  

Not too far away from the strip, plentiful parking, accepts credit cards, friendly service, great food at very wallet friendly prices.  5 stars easy.  Will go back again and I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Their curry is very good although the last time they skimped on the coconut milk."}
{"text":"Great Thai food - reminded me of the many times I visited Thailand. Priced very good, and great service. I recommend."}
{"text":"Worst kung-pao and pad-thai ever. Left everything, just like the table next to us. Server was nice, but didn't make up for the food-without-any-taste. Was also attracted by the 'vegetarian', but only entering the place one smells only meat and seafood... no go anymore."}
{"text":"I've been going here for about 8 years now and I always come back to this place. It's a hole in the wall place in Chinatown. 

Pros:
- much cheaper than other Thai places.
- it's a lot of food.
- after 8 years of going here, nothing much has changed about the quality or menu, which i appreciate.

Cons:
- service can be iffy. they're usually nice, but sometimes forgetful. nothing outstanding, but nothing horribly bad either. that's why i'm not giving this place 5 stars.
- good luck finding parking.

overall, i really think its worth a try. it's been around for many years now, and for good reason too. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place I may have reviewed before but for the last year I have eaten here and it has remained just as good and affordable as day one!!! Also love how clean this place is!!!"}
{"text":"I frequent this spot atleast once a week. Food is great, entirely affordable, even for a family of four. This location's achilles heel has got to be the manner in which they service customers.

1.
The young man who serves during the day drops off the check and just stands there watching us figure out how we would like to split the bill saying \"I'm too lazy to walk back.\" Normally you drop
off a check and come back whenever the patron is done.

2.
The ladies working at night are nice, and I know I came in 30 minutes before closing asking for a table for three. Can't seat us, that's fine. I'll order to go. I'm going through the menu and the lady taking the order is explaining menu items so fast its overwhelming. I finally figure out what it is we wanted to order but that \"hurry up and buy\" attitude needs to go.

Will be back for sure the food isnt the problem ots how the business is represented."}
{"text":"If I'm in the China Town area this is my go-to place for Thai. Every dish we've ordered is good. My husband's favorite is the pad see eu and my kids love the pineapple fried. I love pad thai and this place never disappoints. 
The place is small and can get crowded. There's no waiting area so you have to stand by the front door for a table when it's busy, this can be tricky when your with a family of five."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here because one of them has been there and said that he loved it here (he's thai). It's in the Chinatown-looking area. It was bomb! And cheap!! 

My boyfriend and our two other friends ordered their well-known Beef Noodle Soup. I ordered the panang curry! I was able to try the beef noodle soup, and it was delicious!! The broth was super tastey. It reminded me of pho, but after you put all the hoisin sauce and chili to make it better. Like, the soup itself was like a ready-to-go pho that you don't need to add anything else. The panang curry definitely tasted \"homemade\"/\"grandma recipe\" kind of thing, which I loved about! There was just enough spices to make it just right in taste. I had it medium hot and it was good enough for me. 

The waitress was nice, and the food came out quick. No complaints there. The price is very reasonable for the portions you get as well. I'm definitely coming back if I visit Vegas soon!"}
{"text":"Another great Yelp find!

Hubs and I just drove in from LA and wanted to grab some food before check in. I used Yelp to search for noodles nearby. First I thought of Pho Kim Long but why get Pho when Thai noodles are waaaaaaay better?!

Hubs and I had:
- Lard Na beef (my fav comfort dish)
- Tom yum noodles soup (HUGE bowl!)
- Beef jerky 

It felt so good knowing we were eating great Thai food off the strip. 
Off the strip = more money in my pocket!  

We will definitley return. So good. So reasonably priced. Gem!"}
{"text":"Never had this type of food before, I loved it but the problem is service bad, not friendly at all. We were treated like we didnt belong there or an inconvenience. That's the only reason I give them 3 stars, the food's great."}
{"text":"Worst thai I have ever eaten, service was really bad.  My tea was served in a dirty glass, and the food came out about 20 minutes apart, their were 5 of us.  Will never go there again.  Health department should check them out."}
{"text":"Stunned by how good this place is!  I am a die-hard Le Thai person, but I have long needed a place where I can get my Pad Kee Mow fix both closer to home and open on Sunday.   Thai Noodle House nailed it.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Khuya Kai noodles are a tasty option. Great flavor and personable staff here at this location. This was my second visit to Thai noodle house and I was pleased. I got chicken this time & not shrimp like last time because the shrimp were dirty/not deveined....yucky! They have a delivery option too that is convenient. Thai tea here is liquid diabetes in disguise (fyi)."}
{"text":"My wife and I are addicted to the grill pork salad here haha. It's just everything u want in thai food. Onions, spices, with garlic. The pork has an awesome grilled flavor, juicy. The dressing is quite tangy. It's just excellent, a must try. And u can order it without chili if u don't like hot stuff"}
{"text":"Went back to Vegas, went back to Thai Style Noodle House. Sat at the same table, ordered the same food. Jeez I sound boring. But I just loved it. 

This time I went with obliging yelper-husband and we split the yummy curry and the two appetizers. We both loved it.

Word to the wise: I couldn't remember how hot I ordered it the first time. Husband likes things hotter than I do so we compromised and ordered a 5 (out of 10). Husband said he'd go down to 4 next time and I said I'd go down to 3. So keep in mind that they're serious about the spicy."}
{"text":"Thai Style Noodle House is my favorite Thai restaurant in the north west part of town and tied for my second favorite Thai restaurant overall (tied with Ping Pong and behind Lucki Thai). 

The service is always really good and the food comes fast, but is still prepared well.  

I have gotten a few different dishes but my go-to is Pad See-eu with chicken and a spicy level of 10. You get a generous portion of food and it is simply delicious. I also recommend the pot stickers.

There are other locations in Las Vegas (http://www.thaistylenoodlehouselv.com/), but I have only visited this one."}
{"text":"I love this place, It is not much to look at, but the staff does try to make it feel good and the personal touches are so sweet.
I can't wait to work my way through the menu, it feels like a family joint.
Really nice wait staff, and fast takeout!"}
{"text":"We are constantly on the hunt for good Thai and this didn't quite hit the mark. My boyfriend loves crab rangoons- you get a good amount but the flavor wasn't there. The filling also wasn't hot, so that ruined it as well. The Papaya salad was OK, not something I would get again. 

The Pad Thai was the best thing we ordered for the night. Good amount of flavor, but slightly bland. I ordered the green curry and it was probably one of the worst I have ordered in LV. The green beans are a strange add, I picked those out. They didn't go with the dish at all in my opinion. Not much chicken- definitely jipped on that. They also add way too many in the curry AND papaya salad- I don't think they belonged in either dish. 

Overall, flavors were bland and nothing stood out. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I love the Tom Yum Noodle soup. It's delicious! The portions are huge too.

The kids had orange chicken and rice. It's enough to feed two kids. 

I called in and order was done in 15 minutes. 

The restaurant is clean and gotta love the TVs to kill time.

Just had the BBQ pork with wonton egg noodle soup and it's so good! It had Bok Choy and they are not skimpy with the ingredients. Thanks for building one of these near my house!

Ok forgot to add that I had a great experience here. Great customer service! Good job guys!

UPDATE: The S9 with pork is so good! Don't forget to dip the pork in that sauce that it comes with.

The mango sticky rice is also bomb!"}
{"text":"Cheap and really good Thai food. I think it's the cheapest in town. Service can be slow sometimes, but it is worth it. We normally get the pad se-eu and pad thai. You can't go wrong here and you might even run into a Muay Thai trainer. I know a lot of trainers who love to eat here! Now if they are going there to eat that means it taste like home and you should try it =)"}
{"text":"Food was okay. But the servers are kind of rude. So I asked one of their girl servers for a glass of water with ice, she ignored me. And for the second time, I reminded her about my glass of water with ice.. She raised her voice and said, 'yes i know i know'. LOL"}
{"text":"Maybe we ordered the wrong items(papaya salad, panang curry and drunken noodles) but we weren't blown away. It was pretty good but not one of the better Thai meals I've had."}
{"text":"Came across this hidden gem while picking up an order for Uber Eats. Grabbed a menu and decided to give it a try later in the week. 

It's not always a full house but they seem to get slammed with Uber, Postmates and DoorDash orders. Food might take longer than most places but trust me, they are cranking them out fresh. I haven't had decent Thai since I left NYC and this place knocked it out of the park! I LOVE duck so I ordered the Duck Fried Rice...I don't know what all they put in it but it was absolutely delicious and my official favorite now!

My husband tried the Chicken Pad See-ew which was also a new favorite of ours. If you have the chance, go, go, GO try it out!"}
{"text":"good food and good priced. Its our go to thai place that is close to the house. They always serve good food and is inexpensive . We ate wonton soup and a radna and it came out to $16 for both of us. The portions are large and some dishes you end up taking home."}
{"text":"One of the best pho noodle places there is.  I definitely recommend anyone go there if you love noodle soup."}
{"text":"The best Thia food I have had in a long time, me and 3 others tried 4 different main dishes and a combination appetizers. It was amazing that all tasted better and better. Curry was good and so was the others. The servers where really nice too and food came out fast. A++"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was absolutely amazing with tofu. Startlingly good food. Service was also excellent. Prices are totally reasonable. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in China town. My go to Thai place from now on. The prices are fairly low and the food itself is really good."}
{"text":"Amah-zing!  This is my new lunch place, at least once a week.  Maybe another time for dinner.  Super cheap and everything I've tried is delish.

Thai Noodle House Potstickers, Any Curry, and Tom Kha are a must!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! My new fave spot!  Everything we ordered was top notch,  generous servings and great value for the price esp. when it comes to Thai Food!! Get the Orange chicken, silver glass noodles w/ chicken, thai fried rice, pork larb & thai iced tea... you will NOT be disappointed!  ;)"}
{"text":"I saw Yelp reviews and I thought I'd give this a try. So I stopped by this place to see what the fuzz was all about.

There were many selections of Thai food and that was the only good thing I found. 
I ordered Pad Kee Mao. Oh boy they did it so wrong with the most basic dish. Pad Kee Mao without a black sauce - it was basically fried thick noodles and it was such a letdown. I was wondering if they just had a bad cook that day or just absolutely had no idea how to cook this.

The service was just ok. There were 2 waitresses the day I was eating here. One of them was good and another one was just mediocre - didn't pay much attention except when I was about to pay and leave a tip."}
{"text":"Pad see ew on point  their fried chicken/fried rice combo is Fuego  clean store, nice staff, great food. Overall a pretty great Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"Found hair in my food and tried multiple times to get our server's attention but couldn't. There were two servers. It was a very busy time for them so I understand. We waited but I ended up just sharing food with my friends because I lost appetite for mine. 

We finished our food with no one ever checking on us. We waited for the check but then found that our server seemed to be arguing with another customer about something... check never came so we went up to the counter to pay. 

I kindly told the server about the hair in my food and she didn't seem like she cared. She said \"oh really?\" gave me my change."}
{"text":"Came in here for the first time, our waitress her name was j i p she was very nice, we ordered the Mongolian beef and orange chicken it was very good, we will come back and try another dish, I would recommend this everyone."}
{"text":"Wow. 8 bucks for a tiny portion of chicken and a ton of rice. on top of that it was extremely salty, had CANNED mushrooms and no veggies. At most they put maybe 4 oz of meat. For 8 bucks."}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST Thai food I've had in Vegas. Everything was fresh and delivered within 26 minutes by Uber eats. Orange chicken was light and the noodles were cooked to perfection . Def be ordering from here again!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pad see eww and thai basil fried rice. They were both okay but i honestly prefer my rice to be softer and a bit more oil on it. Ill stick to Krung Siam just down the street. I dont eat pad see eww as much but it was a good option as the veggies were crisp and i wanted to try something new for dinner."}
{"text":"smallest papaya salad I ever seen ,pad see ew lack of flavor,but the pad thai was good,msg for sure its in the dishes average dish $7.50 throat was dry after eating here"}
{"text":"OMG this place was so delicious. Whenever I visit Vegas, I try to eat at somewhere new. This time, we picked this place. 
When we arrived,  it seemed quant and authentic. I ordered Thom Ka chicken and my husband order Hot and Sour soup. We each picked our own noodle. It was so yummy and flavorful.
It was so good that we went back on our last day in Vegas. I tried the Pad Thai this time and my husband tried the pork belly soup. They were both so delicious. Just the perfect amount of umami in every bite.
The next time I visit Vegas, I will definitely be eating here!"}
{"text":"After running a marathon we were tired and hungry. We wanted to eat somewhere local and good. We found this little restaurant through yelp and boy we are super glad we did. First, we were not sure what to expect since the entrance is ok the side of the strip mall. We walked in and found a small restaurant with about 10 tables. We sat and soon the waitress came over with water and menus. We ordered pad Thai with tofu, Ra Na with tofu and spicy egg plant curry. The food was awesome! Very taste super hot (temperature hot) and yes spicy because 2 of us like spicy food, one of us. It so much. So 2 Thai hot and one not spicy. I cannot say enough about this little place. The total was less than $25 for everything. It is totally worth the drive (less than 2 miles from the Palazzo."}
{"text":"Too sweet, maybe a off night, worst I've had in a while, the other locations on rampart and south Jones were much better, south Jones is the best one so far, very clean and modern and same prices."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this place has the best ever! If you want delicious food at good price, you will want to live close to this place :-)  But if you're just visiting, like me, you definitely want to make the trip from the strip. Tried the Pad Thai, the Pad See Eu, the Duck with Red Curry - all cooked the best way I have tasted. Especially loved the Thai Basil Chicken! The only thing you should keep in mind is that the place is small and busy. If you go off hours, you will never eat Thai food elsewhere in Vegas. Oh, and I was one of three white people there :-)  That probably says it all how good the place is..."}
{"text":"It was crazy, stupid delicious. I felt like I was betraying my favorite Thai restaurant in town cause this place has a spot in my heart now.

Was immediately greeted and seated as we walked in. She even put the sun shade down for the boyfriend & I since it was a little sunny. 1 Star!

Ordered our mandatory Thai Teas, in those large beer mugs. Truly appreciate the amount of ice, some places overload it and it gets watery. Sweetness was on point too. 2 Stars! 

Food came right after, Chicken Satay, Chicken Pad Thai (Spice level 6) & BBQ Pork over Fried Rice. Dear lawd, I almost blurted \"Now THATS how it's supposed to be damnit!\" So delicious!!! Chicken skewers had just enough spice and really complemented the peanut sauce. I even put the sauce in my pad Thai. And speaking of that Pad Thai, holy sssshhhhhh, it was everything & more. Spicy but tolerable. Noodles were so flavorful. Chicken was perfectly seasoned. Then the rice and pork BBQ was delicious! The man enjoyed the sweet chili sauce that comes with it while I enjoyed the sweet soy sauce. 3 Stars!

Ended the meal with Sticky Rice & Mangoes. It was really sweet, even the mango. Rice could be softer but I loved it anyway. 4 Stars!

Service was so friendly and quick too. Oh and the prices were so ridiculously cheap. 

And that leads me to 5 Stars! Can't wait to try their amazing lunch special too!"}
{"text":"Good food / Good Price / Good service . I love Thai tea  and combination beef noodles soup / calamari very very very good ."}
{"text":"Normally, I would give Thai Style  a 4-star rating, but had to bring it down this time.

Price - excellent!  Average dish is around $7! 
Quality - usually very good - today, everything was bland.

OH, actually, should have given Thai Style only 1-star, but I am being VERY nice in this review.  We were sitting on the other side of a small decorative retaining wall - watched a cook sneeze into his hand - then continue to move the wok around ... no cleaning of the hand. I mentioned it to the waitress and was told, \"no he did not sneeze\" - I replied, \"ummmm, yes, I just watched, I was right there\" - she said, \"OK, I will take care of it\".  No other mention or concern for what occurred - or is probably occurring all the time.  In light of the Firefly, they might want to pay more attention to these small details."}
{"text":"So bummed, had to move my fave Thai place down to 4 stars. Post-renovation (only change I see is new paint, tables & chairs) the serving size has gotten much smaller - rice on the plate instead of full plate of entree with rice on side. 
Not really worth the drive anymore unless I'm in the area. Even then, lunchtime I'll be going to Krung Siam Thai for their great lunch specials."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience. I ordered to go. Pai thai, and Tom yum soup. The pai thai had no flavor the tom yum had weird imitation chicken."}
{"text":"I love you Noodle House. The Thai Tea is so great! It's very small inside but I don't mind because the food is great. The crab Rangoons are so good too."}
{"text":"I always order the pork over fried rice, spicy. It comes with soup and also two different sauces. Delicious and filling. 

Not a huge fan of their yellow curry but the panag curry is good, if you like spicy I recommend like an 8! 

If you want noodles, I prefer chicken pad seu spicy #10 over their pad Thai. 

Their spicy scale is 1-10 but I don't think their 10 is that spicy.


I always order to go and it does not take more than 20 minutes. Delivery is a bit longer."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times and have never had a bad experience.

The food tastes amazing every time and the waitresses are very nice. I usually get beef and Broccoli or orange chicken. Although I've had many different dishes, and have enjoyed all of them. Their thai tea tastes great.

I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This location has been the best so far when it comes to the food. We've been to all the other ones and it was either the service or food that wasn't great. We try everything on the menu and everything was delicious. It is also a plus being close to our house instead of driving to Chinatown and waiting forever to be seated! Sometimes it is hit or miss with the waitress not coming back to do refills or check on us but our kids enjoy the food anyway. 
The combination noodle soup is rich and tasty. They are generous with their portions too! I love that they never changed their prices which keeps us regulars coming back :) if you order papaya salad, ask for it Lao style if you don't prefer it sour like the Thai way. Red curry, pad see ew, calamari, tom kah kai and any kind of noodle soups are the usuals we get!"}
{"text":"It's used to be good but the last time I visited, the food did not taste balanced. The portion was smaller too and price increases a little."}
{"text":"At first, I was skeptical of trying this place because of their cheap prices. I was prejudice in thinking that it must not be good quality if the prices were this low. This is actually a solid Thai restaurant. Pretty good quality, very affordable and on most nights they deliver. Quite frankly it is the best valued Thai restaurant I've tried. Their portions are fairly generous as well. For the price you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Server is so CLUMSY! She spilled oil thru the spoon that dropped in my new leather wallet. They are not even sorry about the incident! What Fuc..k.ng mess! Food is ok but not worth the experience! No Service etiquette! D+"}
{"text":"So happy I stopped in this place and gave it a try! By far the BEST pad Thai I've ever had in my life. It had a flavor so much better than I've ever had. Very simple and basic, but so delicious. I also ordered the chicken skewer app and it was great. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"The Thai snapper is full of flavor. As always with Thai spice levels proceed with caution. 3 on a 1-10 scale lit me up pretty well."}
{"text":"Spiciest Pad Thai I've had, good food for good price. I recommend it, just not for the service."}
{"text":"Ordered take out: shrimp pad Thai and egg roll. It was pretty good; it satisfied my cravings! Will definitely try to check in the restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Yummy! This place totally hit the spot after a night of drinking and dancing. I got the roasted duck noodle soup with flat noodles and oh man... that soup was so good. I love that there were no bones in there. Just good ol' roasted duck. I almost drank the whole bowl of soup. I did however down my thai iced coffee in like 5 minutes. My boyfriend got the pad see ewe and that was really good, though I don't know how you can go wrong with pad see ewe. Parking was not a problem. I'm definintely coming back the next time I hit Vegas."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai place in Vegas.  Period.  End of sentence.  I've been all over country, from Udorn to Hatyai, and this place is just good old fashioned Thai home cooking and Bangkok street food.  I don't know where Food Network get off on Lotus of Siam (worst in town)."}
{"text":"I love curries so I came here. The first 3 visits went fine. However, when I came as soon as the doors open at 11am, on my 4th dine-in experience, I think they served some left overs from the night before. There were slices of french fries in my yellow chicken curry. At first bite, I thought that I was just wrong. But then, as I kept eating, it is apparent that pieces of french fries were thrown into my plate. I know for a fact that this should not be the case because I order the same meal everytime. Didn't finish my food & never came back."}
{"text":"Came out here on sunny afternoon for lunch. Potstickers, pineapple fried rice and sweet and sour with chicken was bomb. I replaced the rice with vegetables and it made the plate xtra bomb. Also got the chicken sauté and It wasn't my style of food. Other then that everything was good including the service."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. I went to pick up my order of chicken fried rice and orange chicken with rice. I wasn't greeted with a smile or a hello, just a pickup? I asked if she had put soy sauce in the bag and she said yeh so I looked and there was one, I said I need more than 1... she looked at me and grabbed ONE more and walked away. Two small soy sauce packets with two full entrees. Just after that I knew I never wanted to come back. Then went home to eat and that was just eh, very bland, no taste barely any chicken in the fried rice. One of the worst experiences I have ever had. Safe to say I will never ever return. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here twice on my vacation to Vegas recently!! Their thai food is the best I've ever had! If you are visiting Vegas and craving Asian food I would definitely recommend you to try Thai Style Noodle House! Their prices are also extremely reasonable! And another great thing is that the restaurant has a location literally down the street from the Strip! So its a perfect place to go to when you want to have a quiet lunch away from the crowded life on the Strip! 

Their restaurant is small and can get busy during peak lunch or dinner hours! But I can assure you the wait is well worth it! During my visit we ordered a variety of dishes: Crab fried rice, pad thai, pad sae mau, thai beef salad, and yellow curry.

All the dishes were spicy and yummy. Their food was seasoned extremely well! But my ultimate favorite dish was their yellow curry!!! I don't really like curry, but their curry was absolutely delicious. The consistency of their curry was not too watery or thick, it was just right! Their coconut flavor did not over power the curry. And their spiciness level was on point.

If you're heading to Vegas for vacation! You should definitely stop here and give it a try! Its definitely worth it and you won't regret your decision :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places in Vegas! I must say that this isn't the BEST Thai restaurant; however it's as good as it can get for the price! This place is right down the street from my house so I always order to-go through the phone and pick up is usually ready within 15 minutes. 

I tend to stick with the same dishes every time. Pad Thai, pad see ew, Panang curry or spicy basil beef. I've had their house fried rice, and various soups before as well, everything is always delicious! 

I think the main reason for me and many others is the price of this place! Oh man, everything is so cheap!! Thai restaurants usually charge pretty high for an entree here in Vegas and I love that this place keeps it to the minimum! 

I highly recommend this place. Don't even know why it took me this long to leave a review. I've been coming here since this location opened around my house! I have yet to try out their other locations."}
{"text":"My family tried this new Thai place at lake mead and Rampart, the food is excellent and the prices are great. The only bad thing about the place is the rest room is in the back of the restaurant since you have to walk outside  of the restaurant and then walk back to finish dining. But as far as the food and price is concerned it is one of the places that I would recommend. The food we ordered the taste and quality is great. This is definitely a place to go back for regular dining."}
{"text":"Had the Thai spicy noodle, it was baaaaad. I asked them for another dish to replace it and they had the chef come out and tell me it was my fault that it tasted \"sour\" because I put the red chili sauce on it. Obviously that was not the reason, but eventually they did replace it with the panang curry, which was delicious. My friend also had the spicy basil which was really good. Overall I was a disappointed in the service but selective dishes were good. Your call if you want to try this place out."}
{"text":"Thai Style Noodle House in Summerlin :) I have been going to their 2 other locations for over a year now and am glad they now have one closer to me! 

Great food! Good prices! Who can beat that!"}
{"text":"Thai style noodle house is a staple of our Vegas trips. Sometimes we go here everyday because it's just that delicious and affordable. Cheap doesn't necessarily equate to poor quality and this place is a perfect example. 

I usually go for the house noodle which has a combination of minced pork, fish cake, and shrimp in a tom yum soup base and we'll complement it with a stir fried dish of sorts. Our group also had yellow curry and remarked how good it was as well. 

Definite must try location if you're remotely interested in Thai food."}
{"text":"Delish food (sans the fish balls), but the service seemed preferential and slow, which wasn't too much of a problem given we wanted to visit, but it made for an unwelcome feel."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their soups and the pot stickers are the best ever!"}
{"text":"If you are in a hurry DO NOT GO HERE. Service is horrible! Walked in & the place had a few full tables so we were excited to see that - must mean it's good. 

Heard 3 other tables asking for their check as they sat & waited too long for the waiter to bring it.Took over 10 minutes for us to get menus & drinks (soda & water). That's unacceptable. 

Tried the N.H. Style Pot Stickers as an appetizer. They were good. 

Had to ask for the Thai Spices as none were on the table. Had to get up from my meal to go ask for Salt. 

2 shrimp in the Chicken & Shrimps Silver Noodle. Come on Shrimp is in the name of the dish & you only get 2? And they were small on top of that. I've had bigger shrimp in Shrimp with Lobster Sauce at Chinese restaurants. 

Garlic and Pepper Chicken - rice was not cooked enough as it was hard & kept getting stuck in my lunch-mates teeth. It was also really greasy as her stomach was starting to turn as we walked out of the place.

Over all not impressed with the food or the service of this place."}
{"text":"I have only had delivery.

Takes about 45min to get on the west side(from either location), but then again whose delivery doesn't?

I've had Combo (I heart shrimp rolls and chicken stays), NH Style Potstickers, Fried wontons, crab rangoon, mango with sweet sticky rice, thai ice tea, crab rice, (all items great) and also DUCK RICE!!!

DUCK RICE itself gets five stars.

My bestie had the tom yum kai and said it was really good but she still prefers Komol's more.

They get 4 stars for almost always forgetting an item in my delivery 2 out of 5 times."}
{"text":"Today was a fairly busy day for them...not like usual but I definitely love seeing that! My friend and I came in for a dine in and we were greeted instantly. Waters came to us right away. Although it took awhile for the servers to serve our food but the customer service here on the weekend is always better than weekday people. The weekday people always have that grumpy face and never smiled at us for some reason but the weekend people are very attentive and friendly. I was checked on very often to see if we were doing okay or if we needed anymore water. The food was delicious and worth waiting. Definitely recommend to come on the weekends! Great job guys."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here.  Food is always fresh and prepared well. Can't go wrong with their noodle dishes. I ordered the duck fried rice and it was spectacular."}
{"text":"I don't care about eating on the Strip when I can find a great authentic hole-in-the-wall like this place and eat to my hearts content. Some of the best Thai I've had is here and the service is great. Don't expect anything fancy or nice here. This is just about the food and food only. I bet only locals come here, and it's a pity cuz tourists just don't know what they're missing."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and long wait (20-30mins) which meant this is not a good place to have a friend gatherings. However, the food is good. Customer services is okie. My favorite fish is the duck fried rice."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for lunch on Christmas Eve and it was amazing! We are a large group and they were able to accommodate us well. The host and the server were friendly. We ordered a lot of dishes to share. We had the bbq pork (which is out of this world!), chicken fried rice, pad Thai noodles, pad see ew, coconut milk chicken soup, and chicken satay. Everything was beyond flavorful and was better than any Thai food I've ever had back home in California. This was cheaper than going to a buffet and it kept us all full for hours. If you're in the Nevada area, you should definitely come eat here!"}
{"text":"Consistently bomb Thai food is in a tiny hole-in-the-wall spot in Chinatown. When you want solid staple dishes like pad thai, pad see eiu, tom yum soup (best with chicken), or green curry rice (love it with shrimp!), TSNH has you covered. 

But I think their specialty dishes are even better- especially the panang curry with avocado and salmon (so creamy!) and the pad ped snapper (maybe order a little lower on the spice scale than usual). Portions are generous, prices are low (rarely over $10 unless it's a seafood special), $30 can easily get a couple a takeout feast dinner with leftovers."}
{"text":"Loving this new location near Jones and Warm Springs. It's about 5 mins away from my house.

New location is bigger, cleaner, but still offers the same great value and taste as the other Thai Style Noodle locations. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this little whole in the wall Thai place. Serves cheap & really great food. They have been shut down recently because of a roach infestation, yet that does not deter me from coming back :-P
They renovated the place but it's still quite a small area. 

Our usual order is the chicken pad Thai, shrimp fried rice, Thai basil pork or chicken.

The wait staff overall is friendly, they know our order by now lol. I will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Omg better than Thai town in Hollywood. I know, how can that be? It was! & cheeeeeap with huge portions! I will miss u larb and pad see u"}
{"text":"Holy pot stickers!!! Yum! Found this place on Yelp and followed your recommendations, thanks!"}
{"text":"Great simple place thats has a great vibe. The service is good and fast. Very polite. Not too many other restaurants in the area either so its good to have it here. Very clean inside. And everything looks new. I would come back again forsure"}
{"text":"Good thai food.  We had pad thai and a lunch special (chicken).  The service was simple but attentive.  Since moving to Seattle we have missed good Thai and this was better than anything we have found in Seattle.  Price is very reasonable ... compared to prices on the strip it is a real bargain.  Atmosphere is basic diner style."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome.  Great food food prices  excellent service.
Tried the thai noodle house 3, and it was terrible.  Rude service, ok food.  Don't go there go here!

1/7/17 update.
Food is still awesome, best pad thai beef in town.  We eat here at least 2x a week.  Service is impeccable (ask for nk pronounced \"nock\" I think my Thai is horrible, she is very professional and always gets the order exactly right).  Everyone I have brought here loves the food.  They will deliver also.  After trying around ten other thai restaurants I still believe this is the best food, service, and value in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place hands down is delicious, the ambiance is great it's located in a nice area and the restaurant inside is nice and clean. The staff is very friendly and welcoming as soon as you walk in. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Ordered the duck fried rice and added crab and it was horrible. First off there was hardly any duck and to make matters worse, with every bite there was grit in my teeth from crab shell. Worst meal ever! It was like eating rice and sand! Will stick to Siamese Bistro!"}
{"text":"I loooooove noodle house.. but I'm super disappointed. Ordered papaya salad, shrimp panang curry and Thai iced tea. Everything was amazing!!! But I when I got it home I couldn't believe how small the panang was. Even more juice would have been great"}
{"text":"The food was good but the way they added heat was with big dried chili flakes so every bite of food would require me to spit out these little hard chunks."}
{"text":"I was super excited to see a location added right around the corner from my house. I loved every location including this one !  It's cheap and they give you great portions. the flavors are on point and the food comes out relatively fast. What makes this place different from other Thai restaurants is the different choices of soups almost like a create your own with the different noodle varieties. I would say it's one point below authentic but makes up for the price and portions !"}
{"text":"duck fried rice for second time at this hole in wall yesterday. very good . 9 dollars. would go back regularly and try other items.

had some elsewhere for 15 dollars last week. not as good. yelp rated 4.5 stars for thai place."}
{"text":"My family and I frequent here about 2 times a week and we love this place. Food is great and you can't beat the price. 

We usually order an array of dishes and share them. You can't go wrong with the chicken pad se-eu, chicken pot stickers are always crispy, spicy string bean chicken is definitely something worth trying, have a couple breath mints ready after having some chicken garlic and pepper, the panang curry is great; I can go on and on. 

Warning: they are generous with the spicy levels 1-10. I usually go with a 4 or 5. Sometimes I order a 6, and that can be too spicy for me, but I can handle it. My siblings can go higher levels! 

The service is great. Every single time that I have been there or called in an order, everyone has been so nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"The potstickers are amazing!!! Love the Pineapple Fried Rice and Pad Thai as well. Orders are always ready on time and quick when I place a pick up order!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Good food and fair prices. The staff is friendly. The location is nice and clean. We eat here all the time and recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Hidden place in the same plaza as Pho Kim Long. Ate the pad thai, beef noodle soup, crab fried rice and basil beef, all were pretty good compare to other thai places in Vegas.  Thai ice tea were actually real thai ice tea, and price is decent. I rather go here then Pho Kim Long. Place is small but it does get crowded as alot of locals goes here and other tourist that know about this place. So go during off hour as we did if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant so much and I've been coming here for three years now. The only thing that has kept me coming is the server Nok; she is fantastic and genuinely kind. Each time we come we strike up lovely conversations and she always makes sure the food is made correctly and to our liking. The problem comes whenever we get a different server because the customer service here is mediocre and rude. All of the other servers are distant, cold, and talk poorly about their guests. We tip accordingly to the service we receive and when it's Nok we'll tip upwards of 40%, but as much as it pains me we have left no tip before because of how horrible the other servers are. 
I know that a two star rating is detrimental to a businesses rating but when there's only one good server in a restaurant, that's pretty off-putting regardless of how good the food is."}
{"text":"This is still a new place but seems like they are doing good. 

Food : excellent 
Love their noodle choices. The soup is flavorful. 

Price : Fair
Great price for the good quality and quantity. 

Service: average - low 
There are usually two waitresses working here. They are not mean or anything, but not great either. If they could bring a cup of water a little bit sooner, I would tip more though. Such a shame. 

Good place over all. I will come back."}
{"text":"i love surprisingly yummy restaurants in strip malls.  unassuming hole in the walls are my favorites.  as for thai noodle house, this one is definitely one of those.  it's tucked away on the wynn road side of The Center at Spring Mountain.  It's a small place, so it can definitely get busy.  The one server slaving away is always very nice despite the rush!

i'm no thai food connoisseur, but this place tasted as good as all the mall food in thailand.  yup.  i like it.

Dishes that I have tried:
1.  Pad thai
2.  Spicy Basil Noodles
3.  Spicy Basil Fried Rice
4.  Yellow Curry Fried Rice
5.  Tom Yum Gong Soup
6.  Their salmon special... forget what it's called"}
{"text":"wanted to see what the hype was all about. Was disappointed :-( 

panang curry had no flavor, duck friend rice was a little dry.  Maybe a second try will help increase this review. but for now its a 3 star."}
{"text":"Okay, so I thought it would be super yummy ! Nah !..
It's okay.  Had the coconut milk with noodles 
Super pricey ! Didn't get a breakdown of charges 
Service SUCKS!!  Gave me my to go order and damm utensils or napkins. Not what I expected .... 
NO TIP for YOU !"}
{"text":"This place in unsanitary, and the service staff is awful. 

Cons:
1. The Dr.Pepper can that was served to us was dirty (dusty) around the rim. 
2. The fried tofu on the appetizer platter had a hair sticking out of it.
3. They brought me out a soup that I didn't order, then told me they had run out of the duck used in the soup that I had ordered, then told me they could make the duck soup but it would be a wait. My friends were able to start eating right away, after a few minutes I told them to cancel my order, and they told me that they had already started cooking and couldn't cancel my order. I was then told they would, as a courtesy. 
4. Some of the soups were really greasy.

Do yourselves a favor, head over to Hue Thai or the Noodle House on Ft. Apache."}
{"text":"I had come here on recommendation of a friend who lived in Las Vegas. For the most part, I wasn't completely disappointed.

I ordered Pad See Ew with fried tofu, which was on the menu as a pan fried noodle dish, but when it came out it was a soup.

I don't have a real problem with this. However, I am a practicing vegetarian with vegan leanings. Yet, I still bend reluctantly.

After eating my meal, which was delicious, I could tell the broth was not vegetarian.  It was oily and most probably was chicken broth.

I asked one of the workers if it was vegetable or meat-based broth.  He did say that it was a meat-based broth.  Pretty sure the Thai Iced Tea was dairy too.

Oh well....

Great service, quaint space, very affordable, nice location for a low-key restaurant.

If you're not veggie, the food is actually really good. I had regrets but I did eat the food.  The next day I went next door to Veggie Delight."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that if nobody tells you about it, you would never hear about it. The place is small, but cozy. There was a lot of business around 2:30 PM.

We always determine a Thai restaurant's worthiness by tasting it's papaya salad. So we ordered that, pad thai, and green curry beef.

Papaya salad was very good, right away I was impressed. It had the perfect balance of sweetness and tarness. It wasn't too light or salty. Just a perfect little plate of salad.

After the papaya salad, I havd a very high expectation from the rest of food which took a while to get. We sat and watched customers get turn away and waited. It's a small kitchen! Give them a break!!

Pad thai was pretty good, a little sticky. All the noodles got stuck together, but that shows the noodle was not cooked with two cups of oil.

Green curry was only reason I deduct a star from the rating. It was a little salty and I did not find it tasty at all. I mean, curry should taste complex and rich, but this one did not have either character.

I would definitely go back and maybe become a regular.........also the service was super friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Noodle House has the best Asian food right off the strip. It's only a couple minutes away from the Palazzo and is cheap for the portions. Kua Khai noodles are amazing!!! 

I make it a part of every trip to Vegas to make it out to this restaurant. It's a small family run place. It can get busy with the locals coming in during lunch or dinner hours but the food is worth it! I wish this place was in Orange County"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite spot for authentic Thai flavors. The place is clean and the staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"Always drove by this place, I'm glad I finally walked in for lunch!

Very small local place. There's some parking on the street on Wynn Rd or you can park and walk over from the shopping complex.

The menu - listed all the traditional popular dishes. Noodles, soups, rice dishes, most of them offered with your choice of meat, tofu, shrimp, or duck. Didn't see anything that cost more than $8.95. Big score!

I ordered duck fried rice and papaya salad. The salad was OK, a small portion, nothing very spectacular. I guess since it cost only $5.95, I can't be disappointed. However, the duck fried rice - amazing! I ordered it since it got such great reviews. I can see why! You'll think it looks too saucy and salty, just dig in. I was pleasantly surprised to find lots of tender duck. This dish portion was huge! 

For all you Thai Tea lovers, I saw the next table order a few, they were served in those huge pint glasses! The customers were very ecstatic when those drinks arrived!

The two girls serving their small room of tables were friendly and helpful. The prices are awesome, so I'm already looking forward to going back for their potstickers and duck pad thai!"}
{"text":"Great place for a vegan and meat eater to go eat! Although beware... I ordered the veggie potstickers and they came with mayo on them.. When I asked the waitress if the mayo was vegan she was like \"uhh... Yeah?\". Don't lie! I have high doubts that this Thai restaurant has vegan mayo be, for this is not a vegan restaurant... Just so happens they have some vegan options. I would get no mayo if pure vegan and wanna get the potstickers. I always get the drunken noodle with fried tofu and that's amazing!!! Yum"}
{"text":"I have never gone to eat at the restaurant, always order out. So I don't know about the service or atmosphere but the food is good. Ordered from here about three times now and every time I have loved the food. I think they are best at making the various soups. I always get Thom Ka Soup because I think this place makes it the best (even better than Lotus of Siam). Their spicy scale is 1-10 and they aren't messing around. It's great. 

My husband is less into thai but he gets their orange chicken or other entrees. For me they weren't that great. They weren't bad but they weren't anything extraordinary either. I think the noodles and the soups are where this place really shines. They are so flavorful. I recommend trying some of their soups and their chef specials (which have, so far, all been great). Don't forget your thai iced tea."}
{"text":"If you want variety and authentic Asian Cuisine come here! Hong Kong pan fried noodles, ramen, duck fried rice!"}
{"text":"if you live on the other side of town, don't forget they have a trop and ft. apache location. both are fantastic. i luvvvv #38 substitute bean sprouts with chinese broccoli. the duck curry is sooooo tasty. also the tom yum soup with egg noodle hits the spot my spot all the time. i guess food can come out a little slower when they are busy with diners and phone orders, but all dishes are fresh so it is worth it to me. check it out :)"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery around lunch on Sunday. I love Thai and when I dine in I go to Nittayas secret kitchen and lotus of Siam, and everything I can in Chinatown. I live in summerlin and was looking for a go to delivery.  Horrible. Had such a craving for vegetable spring rolls and I bit into the first one and it was so salty I had to spit it out. Like ocean water! I tried another thinking it may have been accidentally dropped in salt but they were all inedible. Beef jerky? So salty. Pumpkin curry? So salty. Horrible. Threw it all out :("}
{"text":"Hole in the wall but great cheap food. 
Don't go there if you want fancy, but go if you just want good food. 
I recommend the pad Thai."}
{"text":"One of the best and very authentic casual Thai restaurant you could ever find in Vegas. We have been to this place for at least 5 years now. The food is excellent, flavorful and authentic. Love Tom Yum noodle and Boat noodle. 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good and Cheap place to get Thai food near Jones and 215. This is the fourth location in LV, but the quality of food is same as any other location. I usually stop by to get their ginger snapper or panang curry with salmon & avocado. My gf loves their beef and egg noddle soup which is also very delicious. The prices are very resonable for the amount of food you get. 

I would highly recommend stopping by this location."}
{"text":"I walked in to a kinda grungy, real authentic-smelling place. As good as any Thai that I've had in New York City. Delish duck soup and vermicelli noodles in soup.  Curry can be ordered on a scale of 1-10 for spiciness. Wish I could tried more dishes."}
{"text":"We went to the Wynn St/Chinatown LV, NV location and was excited to try great Thai food based on other reviews. Prices are very reasonable and maybe this is why the raving reviews? 
Being our first visit here we went with the real basic:
Papaya salad, shrimp pad Thai, Tom yum Seafood noodle soup. Everything was overly salty and maybe that was the biggest problem. I couldn't really taste anything but salt. 
Again, their prices are very reasonable. But doesn't do me any good if I cannot enjoy the food."}
{"text":"This place has taken my heart for my favorite type of Asian food. It used to be Indian food for me, but after this yummy yummy yummy experience at the Thai Style Noodle House.....yeah. It's Thai food all day for me dawg. I had simple yellow curry with veggies and tofu, hubby had shrimp pad Thai. Two dishes we were sure they couldn't mess up. Not only did they not mess up, it was the BEST of both we'd ever had. I asked for level 4 out of 10 spice and nearly died, but i told them and they fixed it down to a level 1 or 2 lol soooooo yummy tho! Will definitely be back. Oh the prices!! After being gauged all week on the strip, i was happy to pay $7.95 per plate. YES, OKAY. EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Thai Style Noodle House is absolutely delicious, and given the constant crowd at this place, I'm not alone in thinking so. My family and I were on a trip to the Grand Canyon and decided to make a pit stop in Vegas (it just seemed like the sensible thing to do, of course). Having been on the road for 5 hours that day, we refused to settle for any Chipotle or other fast-food restaurant, but we weren't in the mood to drop big bucks at a Vegas buffet. Yelp came to the rescue, and we found this gem of a restaurant in Chinatown! First of all - SO MANY OPTIONS! It took us a while to figure out what we wanted. We decided on the the yellow curry, green curry friend rice, thai spice noodles, and red curry, all of which were exquisite! It was truly addicting, with not a spice out of place. The hospitality was great, and our waiter was keen to give her recommendations and craft her suggestions based on our dietary restrictions. When we got the bill, we were shocked at how unbelievably reasonable the whole meal was. Trust me - this is one Vegas decision you will not regret!"}
{"text":"The food is average. Service is horrible here. Be prepare to wait at least 30 minutes for your food. The restaurant is not clean. I saw a couple of cockroaches crawling around."}
{"text":"Good , solid Thai food. There are other places I prefer to get Thai food at but this is my go-to for Thai food whenever I'm around this area. The one on Jones & Warm Springs or the Fort Apache location does not even compare to this one (since this one is the original location). 

I ALWAYS get the duck fried rice. It's my favorite dish here. I recommend ordering their chicken satay (sooo good with the peanut sauce and cucumbers , you can always ask for extra of those) , dumplings , and papaya salad for appetizers. Their Thai iced tea is pretty good , it's not too sweet and comes in a large mug just for 2$. I have to also mention that the prices here are very reasonable compared to the portion sizes. The entrees (7-9$) are shareable & enough for two. Probably the only thing I don't like is that food isn't spicy enough. Their spicy level is 1-10 , and whenever I come here I always order a 10 & it's not spicy enough :( You have to add side spices to make it actually spicy. Also , I'm not really a fan of their angel hair noodles they use in their Pad Thai. Pad Thai is usually bigger in size. Their pad see ew is really good though , they use big flat rice noodles and it's cooked to perfection with Chinese broccoli , egg and choice of meat. I like getting chicken and/or tofu with mine.

You can order most of the items on the menu vegetarian or vegan :) AND they have brown rice available. My vegan friend really liked the Tom kha (Thai spicy and sour hot soup with coconut milk)."}
{"text":"Went here one day just trying new places it was nice, clean and prices were normal. I like spice in my food, told waiter that he kinda looked at me like he was a little confused. Food came was very bland good start needed more spice but nothing special."}
{"text":"Noodle house makes outstanding Thai food. The highlights include Thai iced tea, their pot stickers, tom yum soup, and all the curries (whether w/ or w/o coconut milk). I haven't ordered many other things though, they seem to make these the best. The restaurant isn't fancy or always packed, but I'm there for the great thai food. The spice level is accurate. I've gotten a consistent heat level every time. *Disclaimer - If you do order for pickup, there is typically an irate woman answering phone for all locations. Recently on a Saturday, she told me to hold several times etc; I said I'll order from somewhere else then, and she actually said \"your choice\" instead of \"sorry, just a moment,\" for example. That was bothersome, but I eventually ordered. It's good asian grub. That's what counts!!"}
{"text":"I go here about once a week and the food is consistent. I usually try something every time and I've had some hits and misses with the back page of the menu. The Tom yum noodles, Thai spicy noodles and kuah Kai I think are the best."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has such a high rating. Walked in and didn't feel welcomed at all. The place was dirty and there were longs strands of hair everywhere.  I should've just left when I saw that, but I proceeded to order the Pad Thai. Of course, there was hair in the bag where my food was. The noodles were dry and clumped together. The beef tasteless, under seasoned and rough. It was just nasty. I will NEVER eat here again. 

I just threw the whole bag away after one bite!"}
{"text":"Amazing food portions and quality. The dishes came out very fast. Service was super friendly. Ask for spice level if the waitress forgot to ask you. It was our first time eating at Chinatown in Vegas. We will definitely come back here again next time for the foods and the service"}
{"text":"The service sucked because the people that work there appeared to be rude. The food was just average for Thai food.  Kung fu on Valley and spring mountain is much better.  I will never be back at this place again."}
{"text":"We ordered the devliery service while staying at THEHotel. It took them a while to figure out where THEHotel was and they delivered to the valet and we picked it up. 

Pad Thai: Good but not the best I have had. The noodles were extra thin so that was interesting. 

Drunken Noodles: OMG! YUMMMY!!!!! My wife ordered that and I wish I had! 

Thai Iced Tea: Perfect! 

Price: Super budget friendly!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Delivery Only. I have never dined in here, but every time I ordered they were always on time. 

I usually order their shrimp pad thai, thai ice tea, tom yum soup, their curry pineapple and shrimp with rice...It's sooo worth it, and of course their papaya salad. They are very nice, and for that they deserve a good tip. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Other reviews were spot on about the Decor and the Food. The Decor is lacking but I was waited on quickly and my food came to me within a few shot minutes. The Food is excellent and I highly recommend the Papaya Salad on Medium heat, just enough to have a little kick. I also had the Green Beans with Red Curry, also excellent, word to the wise, their hot scale is a real hot scale, so if you order a 10, be forewarned, it'll be HOT. Flavorful and hot. I'm sweating on an 8!"}
{"text":"This one of the best thai places I have been to in a long time. We were just visiting from LA for the weekend and ended up in this place on Sat night before parting. We ordered padthai, pad see ew, tom Kah soup and papaya salad. They were all very cheap and nicely cooked. In LA, you normally have to pay $10-12 for padthai and they are not even as good. So I was more than happy about this place."}
{"text":"best tai food I ever had so far!  and ? price is awesome.  wish there is something like this in San diego"}
{"text":"Was staying in Vegas for the weekend and did not feel like going out for dinner. My husband I decided to give this place a try and they deliver! Food was fresh and tasty! It also didn't cost us over a hundred dollars if we did go out. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Super tasty with incredible prices. The place is just a small hole in the wall in Chinatown. If you're looking for take out you cannot beat the value."}
{"text":"Noticed this spot several times as we hit up the joint next door: SOHO- DA BOMB DIGGITY!  We always by-passed this place due to it always appearing empty.  That usually speaks a lot.  Boy were we wrong to overlook the unassuming spot.

The decor is nice / clean lines / open feel.  The server was nice but totally home grown.  She was kind of all over the place.  I noticed there's A LOT of take out that's called into this place.  Nothing like Thai take out!  That's probably what drives this business to stay open.

The food was pleasantly good.  Not like your average Thai place where everything tastes good but doesn't look good.  They definitely plated with thought.  Things looked and tasted clean and refreshing.  

The pork beef jerky was amazing!  Not too chewy, packed a ton of flavor.  I was craving soup and the Tom Yum had the perfect balance of spice and citrus from the lemon grass.  It's a great detoxing soup and they were on point with the flavor.  

We also had the panang pork curry- level 3 which was perfect to taste the deep and rich flavor.  Any spicier you loose the complexity of the dish.  The chicken satay was chicken breast marinated in a curry coconut and not just sated like most places. I appreciate that extra step of LUV.  I wish the dipping sauce had more peanut punch though.  

The real Winner were the pot stickers.  Nice crunch and dressed up like it was on a date lol.  Looked and tasted like a dish from a nice sushi joint.  The spicy mayo and contrast of teriyaki drizzle and sesame seeds left you wanting a second date!  Lol

All and all it was a great experience.  Only 40.00 for 2 of us and we had a Diet Coke & Thai Coffee.  Surprised & Satisfied, can't ask for more than that!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place.  We set out to get Boba tea next door at Perfect scoop, but decided to have lunch first. The place is quiet, clean and staff very friendly.  I had the pineapple curry with Shrimp & rice.. Delicious. They let you choose your heat level, I chose 5 and it was perfect.  My husband chose the Pineapple fried rice, cashew, chicken, He loved it and took half of it home, as the portion was very large.. Our waiter was kind, always filling our water glass, They have Tv's to watch too, I am glad we found this cute place.."}
{"text":"I would have rated this place 5 stars because of their delicious food. However, i think this location needs to be cleaned especially the floor. Every time we walked in there was always this awful smell that isnt very inviting. The food never disappoints me. I've been going here for the past year and everything is on point. I recommend their beef salad, combination noodle soup, crab fried rice, pad see ew, guay tiew lord, and orange chicken which isn't just a typical chinese dish but waayyyy better. Oh, and don't forget to order their authentic LARGE thai tea, it's huge! Definitely worth the money :)"}
{"text":"I would drive here from Orange County, where I live, just to eat here. It was that good. I have been to Thailand twice for extended periods, and this food brought back some great memories. The staff were very friendly and helpful. My food arrived five minutes after I ordered, and the serving size was plentiful. I ordered the crispy pork over steamed rice. There were a couple sauces on the side - savory and sweet and sour. The pork was perfectly crispy and tender in the middle. I got a Thai iced tea, and since they were out of the regular small glasses, they gave me a huge mug, at the cost of the smaller size."}
{"text":"Friendly's staff, like family. Super reasonable prices. Though it's small the ambiance is wonderful. I can fill myself with wonderful Thai food , including food, drink and tip for less than 10 dollars.  How great is that!"}
{"text":"Have always found this little \"hole in the wall\" (not the easiest to find if you are not familiar with the area) to be a gem. 

1. Value....9/10
2. Food Quality....8/10
3. Staff Attitude and Presence...  7/10
4. Ambience.....Well, this could use some work. But, it is a cozy feeling in a sense. 

Overall, I have been very pleased with this restaurant located in Chinatown, and have been a solid / loyal customer there for the past two (2) years. 

I recommend the Thai Noodle House.... for value alone."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Las Vegas. My husband has had every item on the menu. My go to items are red curry, pad Thai, fried rice and pot stickers. Some days I would just go here for dinner by myself. Service isn't amazing but the food is beyond good so it doesn't matter to me. I've been to every location in town but this one has the best interior."}
{"text":"Good prices, and portion sizes. The Pot stickers are amazing!"}
{"text":"Food was great,large portions & the service was awesome ..We'll diffendently be coming back."}
{"text":"Despite all the little problems with some of the workers and how they made my food from time to time, overall the day shift people are the best. They have pretty good service or at least okay service; but lemme tell you about the food. They serve pretty bomb Thai food, I always find myself wanting to come back just because of their food. And I can't really give them a bad review because the service or some workers weren't that great (well I mean I can LOL) but I'm gonna be fair and rate them specifically on their food and their food is always so delicious (when I'm eating there) but if you order to go expect for the food to not be so perfect every time. My absolute favorites from here is the Tom yum soup, the roasted duck curry and the crab fried rice. OH and the fried shrimp over fried rice, all at level 6 spiciness. I've only gotten 1 out of 3 plates of fried shrimp over fried rice done correctly though so I don't try to order that one too often but I definitely do recommend this place it's one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to"}
{"text":"They have no personality!  $15.30 just for veggies  egg rolls and add on's..
No matter how good the food is, i won't go back there again!"}
{"text":"In Vegas for a conference and was dying to get away from the casino's and the overpriced crap. My sister, a Las Vegas local, told me we were getting Thai and picked me up. Just down the street from where I'm staying, the price was cheap, the portions were large and the food was fantastic. It's a very small spot and kind of unassuming as it's tucked on the side of one of the shopping centers but if you get a chance I highly recommend you seek it out. Panang was fantastic, the heats still making my face red."}
{"text":"So I am upgrading my ratings for them.  I have been going their alot recently as the food in the EDR at work is getting to be near inedible.  Since I get off work around 9pmish.... They are still open and I can get take out for the next day.... And they are closer to my house then Archi's and they are cheaper. Always a good thing!! :)

Well I finally discovered a stir fried noodle dish that freaking rocks and I have never had this dish anywhere else. It's so freaking good!!! This is one stir fried noodle dish that they have been totally rocking it out on....Khua Kai. It's apparently a Chinese influenced dish lightly seasoned with soy sauce, oyster sauce and fish sauce. All I can say is that it's deliciousness! They basically cook the large flat rice noodles with egg and fried tofu in my case and place it like a large pancake over bean sprouts. They serve this with sweet chilli sauce. And I add some sambal for heat.  They almost seem to char the noodles and that charred flavor adds a little smoky flavor to this dish that's top notch!!! For me.... Perfect flavor and perfect texture on the noodles!!(5/5). :)

I'll be going there again soon to see if other dishes that I have not tried live up to this dish. :)"}
{"text":"I was so happy with this past trip to Vegas. No... I didn't gamble and win a lot of money. But  I did find a few hole in the walls with great food and great prices. 

Thai Style Noodle House was our first stop. 

The restaurant is small and we filled up half the restaurant with our table of 8. 

The first thing I noticed was the crazy mural on the wall... I didn't like the Vegas motif mixed with Thai gods. 

But the second thing I noticed, which I was very happy about, was how well priced everything was. 

All their items sounded really good. I was naturally gravitated towards the duck dishes because I rarely see duck on menus. I had one of my friends share with me so I could try more than one item. 
We got a fried flat noodle dish and the duck curry.

Both dishes came out with big portions but more so for the duck curry. It came in a bigger bowl than the other curry dishes. 

This part of the review is very IMPORTANT! 
Do yourself a favor and skip the Thai Tea... Sure it's good and all but you got to order the Coconut Juice. It might just be the most refreshing drink you ever had. 

I ordered a Thai Tea but when I tried my friend's Coconut Juice, I asked one of my friends on the other far end of the table to take it off my hands so I can order the coconut juice. 

My Laotian friend also stated how authentic the food was. Laos and Thailand are close and share similar dishes."}
{"text":"This place has great Thai food.  I took a friend who was visiting from Thailand, and he suggested to me that this is a great restaurant.  The staff is courteous, and the atmosphere based on location is fine.  The heat is true to Thai cuisine.  Many other Thai restaurants in town have amercanized the spice to appeal to a larger group.  Not here.  This is a good thing.  Worth finding for sure."}
{"text":"Thai Noodle House is an unassuming but delicious little place across the street from the Chinatown shopping center. The noodles were solid, as were the potstickers (crispy) with house sauce. My friend ordered the papaya salad, which he brazenly asked for \"extra spicy.\" The Thais know their spicy, not to be taken lightly. We were crying and couldn't even finish the dish, but then again we are little white pussies. But kudos to this place for giving it to us as we'd asked. I'm all for getting an authentic eating experience in exchange for 20 minutes of shitting fire. It's a fair trade in my opinion. Isn't that why God invented ass cream?"}
{"text":"This place only opened a few months ago, we've tried a few of their dishes! I can say everything we've ordered was very good! My sons favorite is their orange chicken and rice. Hubby loves their BBQ chicken with brown rice. I love their three companions plate with sticky rice and papaya salad with a little spicy. Their larb is excellent!! We order from them regularly! Service is great and they already know us! I haven't had a chance to try their deserts and drinks yet, that's next on my list. :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this location! It is on the smaller side but I think that gives it a more homey atmosphere. Staff is super attentive and sweet. There is hardly a wait to be seated and if there ever is, it is well worth it! The food is divine, very tasty and the portions are more than generous! The pricing is very reasonable for what you get. My wife and I ordered edamame, crab fried rice, (my favorite) the duck noodle soup and desert; all for about $20. If you have never tried duck I highly recommend the duck noodle soup, the broth is so flavorful and the pieces of duck are very tender. I'm not to big on fried rice but this crab fried rice is the best I have ever had!!! You really get that delicious crab flavor with out it being fishy in any sense. For desert we had the fried banana with ice cream which was just as delicious as the rest of the meal."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good food, great prices and good service. Big portions too. Place is always clean. No complaints!"}
{"text":"The food is great as well as the prices! Their chicken fried rice is awesome as well as their chicken potstickers oh and the pad Thai!!! Staff is courteous so that's a plus ! The only downfall is the size of the location :( it's very small and gets busy on the weekends so their is a slight wait time. I'm not too sure about the weekdays however ? Anyways great place whether you're a local or a tourist and need some good cheap Thai food! Haha oh and I think there's a boba shop next door"}
{"text":"We found Thai Style Noodle House on Yelp and it was exactly what we were looking for at lunch. 

We started with dumplings which were quite good.  Mr R and I ordered spicy mint leaf noodles with chicken and panang curry with beef. The noodles were velvety instead of overly oily, they were amazing and our favorite dish of the meal. The 10 year old ordered the Tom Yum soup and loved it.

The tap water was disgusting, it tasted chemically or treated somehow. 

I'd recommend the place!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for good, authentic, and cheap Thai food, not to mention their portions are huge! I come here to order to-go and whenever my friends are in town. 5 stars for quality and for the bang for your buck! The staff is friendly, although quiet.

I always end up ordering the Tom Yum Noodle Soup with 7 spice level. It is so delicious and filling. I love how this dish comes with pork, shrimp, and fish cakes. It is like heaven in a bowl and great for cold days and hangovers (hah). Their basil fried rice and thai fried rice was amazing! I can't usually eat that many carbs in one sitting but I nearly ate the whole plate in one sitting. Like I said, each plate can yield about 2 meals (3 if you are a very light eater), so order accordingly. But hey, leftovers is never a bad thing either!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The flavors are sooo on point and the service is great. Definitely my go to place to grab awesome food when I'm in the neighborhood :)"}
{"text":"I hate being so negative, but this is for those who care about service and cleanliness, both of which were sorely lacking today. The chairs, for starters, looked like they were attacked by someone's pet lion. The floors looked like they might get mopped once a week with layers of dirt and footprints visible along with the added ambiance of strewn straw wrappers and gunk galore. The rectangular overhead vent was caked with visible dust. The windows were also filthy. The waitresses sat by the counter talking to one another through the meal, so I had to get up to ask for chopsticks and for more tea. That is not really the big deal, but a family of four came in after us and were seated at a filthy table that had not been cleaned off or wiped down before they were seated. If the place was buzzing, there would still be no excuse, but the place was just about empty. Instead of socializing and ignoring the customers, the help could have made sure the tables and the floor were clean. The shame of it is the food was very tasty, but I am grateful I did not see the kitchen."}
{"text":"Meh.  I got pad see ew and my husband of pork fried rice.  It seemed like something was missing. Salt ,msg ?! I don't know!!! The price was good for the portion size but it was just missing something. My husband felt the same way."}
{"text":"3 stars means average and that's what this place was.  I tried this place for the first time tonight.  It was just ok.  Nothing great but nothing bad.  It is very close to me so I might stop by again."}
{"text":"Hot Thai Jelly Bean

It's a dive.  That's OK if the food and the price make up for it, but they don't.  It's located on an industrial building end cap.  Hmmmmm, romance.  

When the name of the place includes the word, noodle, you'd think noodles would show a sign of... noodle expertise.  It doesn't.

My Pad Thai noodles had gummy nodules, large clumps better eaten with the help of a knife.  And the dish was too sweet.  I kept thinking you could mold the stuff into a Pad Thai Jelly Bean or maybe a Gummy Bear.  No, it was already a Gummy Bear.  I came back to the office and brushed my teeth.  

Quite a few Thai-looking folks in there, and I wondered if the family could really be that large.  I don't know why any other Thais would be there, not with so many other choices in Las Vegas China Town."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I know it well. I ordered pineapple fried rice and it came out like Chinese fried rice with pineapple in it. No curry, cumin , or anything that resembles Thai. My niece ordered Egg drop soup , and it tasted like dish soap and was very cloudy. My daughter ordered breaded chicken ( greasy and gross) My niece ordered yellow curry and was never asked how spicy  she wanted it. I will never go back to this place. I felt like I was in the Matrix dodging bullets. If you want real Thai check out Archie's. The waitress did try to give me something else, buying lost my appetite."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite place for Thai food. Definitely try their beef pad see ew, avocado salmon curry, and a Thai iced tea. Yum! You can't beat these prices either. The only thing is that they lack in taste consistency. Still, each time it's good--just sometimes it's a different kind of good."}
{"text":"First-time review. I came here 30 minutes before 4pm and made it in time for their lunch special. It was a bit quiet when I first arrived, so I had no issues with service. For their lunch special, I ordered the panang curry with an egg roll and egg drop soup for under $6.

The egg drop soup was decent - it lacked a little flavor. The panang curry was delicious and I was able to taste the coconut milk with a little spice, but had more of a watery texture. I'm more of a fan of a thicker soup base with a lot more spice when it comes to curry, but they do give you the red chili flakes to add as needed. 

Overall, I like this place especially the price! I will be back!"}
{"text":"A great place!! The chicken red curry is fantastic. The workers are so welcoming and helpful. I feel lucky that this is close to home, its easy for carry out and sitting in there is pleasant too. Excellent place check it out!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai joints in the U.S.  I come by 1-2 times per visit.  

\"Medium\" is still pretty damn spicy.  I love that.

Great service, great food...what else do you want?"}
{"text":"I really like their green chicken curry.. It has a lot of flavor and just some of the best Thai curry you can get in town. The potstickers are a great addition to any meal. The meat inside is delicious and the outside crispy as should be and they add delicious sauce to to the top of them. Check this place out it's really worth your trip!"}
{"text":"Really nice place close by to my house .... friendly stuff the prices are not that bad, the food is good, it's a nice place to have something fast and good. I really like Thai food and happy to fined this place"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food! I thoroughly enjoyed it. I got the pad Thai and crab Rangoon and it was delicious. Fast, courteous service. Highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Must have been an off day or something but the reviews i'm reading of this fine establishment does not reflect what was experienced.

Met up a with a group of fellow yelpers for a meal before a UYE. Having come late i had to ask for a set of dining ware and plates as well as a beverage. Another from our party arrive late and again we had to ask for the starting setup, then the last came and again we had to ask for the initial setup. 

I couldnt identify the dishes ordered by the advanced party so i wont consider them in this review.

The pad thai was sub par, didnt include enough peanuts nor was it arranged traditionally with the bean sprouts on top. Lime wedges werent included. Taste was alright but on the bland side. Plenty of prawns but light on the taste.

The panang curry was a huge disappointment for me. the taste was very light and didnt have much of a curry taste. Had a lot of chicken but very little of anything else. Would have liked more bell peppers and bamboo shoots or anything.

Seeing as everyone reviews highly so i intend on coming back in attempt to experience the hype."}
{"text":"So after a Glorious Day in the sun and hitting up some of the Vegas pools...my roomie his girl and myself defintly had the munchies...we were sitting in the car exiting Encore trying to decide what we wanted and I was like...\"Dude I always see you bringing takeout from that Thai place...I've never been, lets go!!!\"...Awesome Thai Style Noodle House it was!

Going into the place I knew beforehand it was kind of a hole in the wall kinda joint...small and cozy, it was about what I had expected...about room enough to hold 25-30ish peeps at a time betwen different 2 seaters, 4 seaters, that could be pushed together to hold more (like a 10group that was chowing down as we entered)...1st things that hit me were the smell, and I automatically saw how big the soup bowls were from the 10group...YUM!!!....My mouth had allready started watering!!!  HAHA

Started looking at the Trifold menu...and my sillyass spread my arms out wide, put my hands across everyones menu's n was like....I don't care what we get...DUDE!!!...whats the name of the cocunut spicy soup cuz we are SO getting that!!!...(Tom Kha)...Mmmmmm!!!

Between the 3 of us we had a Huge Bowl of Tom Kha (medium), Duck Fried Rice, Pad Thai, and Mongolian Beef w/ Rice... (all for $35 w/ tip mind you!!!....)

Before I start all I am going to caveat with is the fact that we ate around 6...it is 1am and I just woke from my Food Coma!!!

Portions were Big!!!  Usually I like everything spicy spicy!...we order the Tom Kha medium, and it was a perfect blend of keeping all the flavor without being overpowered...Medium is a good hoice is someone can't handle spicy well as was in our case, De-Ri-Cious!!!
The Duck Fried rice was over the top...again great portion size and you could see the large cuts of duck in there, YUMMM!!!
Pad Thai (combo)...portion size was a lil smaller then the previous 2 but totally adequete...great taste
Not gonna lie, Mongolian Beef was tasty, but nothing to rave about like the previous ones...

ok, without even meaning to I totally just listed those in order from: Totally Yummy!!!...to...it was allright...haha!

Forgot to mention the service, service was quick and the waitress didn't lollygag at welcoming us or taking our orders!  Water glasses were allways filled...and trust me we were sucking it down (so to speak) after a day in the sun.  I know next time I will totally have to order the Thai Tea.....you could see these large, almost beer mug looking tea's being passed around, but yea....I was totally craving water at that point, LOL

So overall, food wise, 5 STARS!!!....I ALMOST took it down a star, cuz yea if your looking for the ambiance and the cheeze of chinatown this may not be your spot, go into it knowing it's a holeinthewall, but with that also comes the best food and the best service!!!  Hell I hear during lunchtime it's packed so that has to speak volumes right...and plus for all that food it was only $30 +tip!!!  (AWESOME prices, totally took it back up to 5 stars!)

Too far from my work to make it for lunch, but if you ever see a guy in late afternoon/night wearing a uniform, know thats me coming home from Nellis craving some soul food to satisfy the tummy!!!    ^_^"}
{"text":"Great value: Thai food for roughly $7/plate, and it's a big plate! I prefer take out rather than dine-in from here, but all the noodle dishes are solid options (beef pad see eu and chicken pad thai being staples), as winter rolls out I'll be ordering heavily from the diverse soups offered.
Service is polite, interior is surprisingly upscale if poorly maintained, and the pricing really can't be beat- especially for Summerlin!"}
{"text":"Situated on the corner end of the Long Asian Resataurant Filled strip mall was this Darn Good Thai Spot! 

Lunch Orders:

Thai Style Noodle with Chicken: At first we were going to order their Thai Basil Dish and Pad See Ew.. The server suggested to try this dish since it was a hybrid of the Thai Basil and Pad See.. Great Portion, Flat Noodles AND Chicken were some of the tastiest I've had!! I usually go for Pork because usually beef and chicken just don't have that Yum factor.. Basil was perfectly balanced through out the dish. No Negatives what so ever!

Duck Fried Rice: I think they used a brown grain rice or some fatter type of steamed rice that was cloaked in their saute oil/soy sauce or whatever they used to cook it?.. The duck  strips and shreds were sparringly spread but just enough to satisfy. Another nice portion and quite tasty as well.

Thai Iced Tea: Typical, Creamy and Refreshing especially after all those scoops of red hot chile sauce!

Little hole in the wall dishin' out  some Big flavored dishes!! Good Service and Prices for portions! I wil be back soon!"}
{"text":"Duck dishes rock. Tom \"Yum\" soup is indeed that!  Be sure to aim low when specifying how spicy. I can take spice, but my soup was only a \"6\"... which burned through me and the chair beneath.

If you want casual low-priced meal, you won't find it on the strip.  The places are outside the perimeter.  Don't be fooled by this hole in the wall -- this is not only great food, but specifically great Thai food at any price. Appears to be family owned and operated -- which I suppose goes without saying in most hole-in-the-wall Thai places."}
{"text":"Friendly staff everytime we eat here. its 2 minutes from home, quick service and real good thai food, duck fried rice is awesome, their pad thai is so delish even a 5 on a spicy scale is super spicy but its great for all spice loving eaters. if ur into thai iced coffee or thai iced tea i suggest u get a large. its only 50 cents more so its deff worth it. this is our regular to-go-to thai place. two thumbs up"}
{"text":"They are always so nice and their food is delicious, good price as well. I usually order takeout but the inside of their restaurant is very cute and clean. Thanks people of Thai Noodle House for the delicious food!"}
{"text":"I said I would stop by again if I went to Vegas, and I did three years later...

I had the same plates that I had the last time around and they are just as good. In addition to those plates, we also got the Hoi-Tod which is kind of like an assorted seafood pancake with beansprouts. We saw some diners next to us eat it, so we had to get it. It is something you would look pass on the menu, but don't! I'll be back in maybe three years or so..."}
{"text":"Nice small place. Very authentic food. Recommended: any fried rice. I got the crab fried rice and one of the best dishes I have eaten at a Thai place. 
Crab Rangoon are great too. 

Curries not recommended. Wasted the panang curry. Fried rice any day over the curry."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Spacious place, good for large parties. I have been here a few times now, this is a great place to grab a quick lunch for decent prices. 

I have tried their duck fried rice, pineapple fried rice, their stir fried noodles, Tom yum noodles, spicy eggplant with rice... All were very good. My absolute favorite is their fried rice, their fried rice smells soooo good, no other places have fried rice that give off such a great stir fried smell. 

Service varies but overall decent. This place is cheaper than other Thai  places in the area."}
{"text":"Good Thai food at extremely reasonable prices.

Ordered the papaya salad, crab fried rice, a noodle dish, curry and a soup.  Everything was good.  Only problem was the consistency of the heat level, we ordered the same heat level for every dish but some dishes were considerably more spicy than others.  It didn't really bother me but I can see how it could be a problem for others.  

Will definitely be back the next time I want some Thai food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had their papaya salad and pad Thai yesterday for me and hubby's late lunch ...and it was delish!!! The papaya salad was a lil spicy (#7 spicyness) for me but I sucked it up because it was ssso good! Lol. The seafood pad Thai was simply made but it was all there, flavor wise. Also the service was real good too!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this place via Eat24 and paid cash. Order was completely wrong so I contacted Eat24 and they contacted the restaurant, restaurant had agreed to make the correct order and send it with a delivery driver. After waiting for about an hour with no delivery in sight I went ahead and called Eat24 yet again again and spoke to a lovely lady named Paige who has been has been helping me out The Whole time. I informed her that my reorder has not yet arrived so she placed me on a brief hold to re contact the restaurant. She then got back on the line with me and told me the restaurant is refusing to make me the correct order. I told her to go ahead and let them know to come and pick up their food and bring me back my money. She told me that if I wanted a refund then I would have to go in store and get the refund that way. So that is what my husband is doing. Oh by the way they have extremely rude and horrible on phone customer service skills. In my opinion I would think twice before ordering takeout from this restaurant. I hope you all find this information helpful."}
{"text":"I ordered a Thai beef salad to go that had good spice and balenced flavor but the beef was cut very thin and somewhat dry and the salad was a little lacking as well.  Prices were good and I will give it another chance sometime soon."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and takeout.  Whenever I have a thai craving I text my friend and head here.  Love having such a great place in our area!  Love love love the panang curry...I dream of this stuff!  Spicey Eggplant is a another surprisingly tasty dish.  Potstickers are very good.  Pad thai can be very inconsistent.   Never had a bad dish here!  My only complaint would be the service...it's doesn't exactly come with a smile all the time. 

Don't know where to go for dinner/lunch?  Go here.  It won't break the bank and you'll leave with a full belly and a smile!"}
{"text":"Severe vomiting and diarrhea as we speak after eating this for lunch yesterday. 
Food tasted good but came out so so bad. Will unfortunately never be ordering again. Full on food poisoning."}
{"text":"I work at the Mountain View hospital, and I am so glad I discovered Thai Style Noodle House.

I order lunch from Thai Style Noodle House probably once a week. They are as reasonably priced as any other lunch establishment and I have yet to be disappointed by the food they deliver. 

I can honestly say that their pot stickers with their special sauce on top are the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD. I also usually get either the chicken pad thai or the yellow curry. Both are always pretty good, I wish however they would provide me with a larger container for my curry. They fill the container to the rim with the delicious curry leaving me no room at all for my rice. I always end up using my own bowl to make due.

On two occasions they did have a delivery driver available. I ended up going to pick up the food and felt so much better knowing my food was coming from a really clean place. 

Thai Style Noodle House is a perfect spot for some tasty Thai food."}
{"text":"Papaya salad is my fave. I also had tomyum noodle which taste little bit differnt than what im used to(too sweet) but i had lemon juice in it, it was much better. Price is very reasonable 3star becuz of not very friendly staffs."}
{"text":"Awesome tom kha soup, crab fried rice abs panang curry!  Friendly service and great value!!"}
{"text":"This place really hits the spot on colder nights. They have lots of spicy noodle items and they let you choose between several noodle types. Also their fried rice dishes are spicy so if this place doesn't warm you up, then oh well.
The roasted duck noodle was quite good and tasted different than other broths. I like different things so this was a very nice change of pace for me. 
The chicken noodle soups are so perfect for combating a cold. You get a good amount of food for a decent price, which makes it an excellent value. 
It's somewhat small inside, so be ready for that. Maybe avoid peak hours. And if it matters, there are actual Thai people working here. For some reason I like watching them take down my order in Thai. 
Anyways, give it a try. It's different than the somewhat boring Japanese ramen places (those are bold words coming out of MY mouth). Different is good!"}
{"text":"Beef pad see ew ($7.50 out the door)- large serving of it for the price. I was excited because it had tons of veg in it, and a good amount of meat. Flavor was OK, not great. 

Thai iced coffee ($2.15 out the door) - very watered down, disappointing


Ordered by phone, had to wait 10 min in store so always safe to give a few extra min"}
{"text":"Such good lunch specials!  You get a decent portion and it tastes delicious.  I usually get pad see ew and it is always on point.  

A very good affordable place with quality food."}
{"text":"So sorry people expect a smile when you walk in - Really??  It is about getting consistent food, service and inexpensive.  This is not top shelf, however it is great for consistency.  Cooks change, however the recipe are the same - KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."}
{"text":"Good but not great Thai food. There aren't that many even good Thai places in Summerlin, so I will be back"}
{"text":"Spicy! Great pad Thai and Tom yum with chicken.  Great prices too."}
{"text":"Great food + service in a cozy atmosphere.  Just wish i had time to try everything!!!"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here, and the Customer and was great! There is a guy named Night, and he was awesome. Being new to Thai food He answered my questions with patience, and even made some suggestions. I ordered a Thai tea, yellow curry, and pad Thai with steamed tofu. Portions are good, and food was good. I will come back for the customer svs!"}
{"text":"I love their portions and the food is very tasty!  I will definitely visit this place next time I'm getting slaughtered on the poker table.."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try since I was in the area headed to an oil change @ Sonnic Auto. I have been to Veggie Delight next door a handful of times and saw the yelp reviews for this place and decided to give it a shot. A mistake I won't make again...
First , upon entry I noticed the very loud tv blaring a Vietnamese show. In addition to that noise were some employees on a lunch break talking very loud to the working employee. I still thought I'll see if the food was any good..
It took a while to get my order in as the waitress was busy socializing with her fellow co workers. Ummm, not okay.
I ordered vegan potstickers (which came out with mayo all over them), sent them back to get another order which was dry outside and greasy inside, and the silver noodle salad. The salad was decent, but not worth the high volume noise of
blaring tv, chatty employees, and crummy service I experienced. Definitely will not return here ever, as I'll be sticking with Veggie Delight next door!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service was great. Pui was very sweet, and had no issue making sure my dish would be vegan. (They even print 'vegan' on the receipt, which seems minor, but I really appreciate the nod that they recognize it's important to you. Vegans and vegetarians should feel comfortable eating here.)

Sorry to bury the lead but I ordered the spicy eggplant with tofu and vegetables. The eggplant had a tasty, delicious thing going on. Everything was nice. For $7.45 before tax it's a good value. I added an extra side of rice for $1.25 more; we sent $0.71 to the Nevada government so that they wouldn't lock us in a cage; and after paying off Pui for being wonderful, it was a $12 lunch. Money well spent, 5 stars all day."}
{"text":"It was my first time here last night and the food was very good! I loved the duck fried rice!"}
{"text":"Ok, I know we walked in 25 minutes before closing, but jeesh! Talk about being rushed in and rushed out. When we walked in the door, the hostess said, \"We close in 20 minutes, and the kitchen closes in 8, so do you know what you want to eat? Because otherwise....\" 

We were hungry, so we quickly figured it out! My friend had the duck fried rice, I had seafood pad thai, and we had calamari as an appetizer. I liked the calamari, it was meaty and piping hot, but didn't have a lot of spice or kick to it. A little sauce fixed that up, though.

My friend's duck fried rice was delicious! I had food envy for sure, but restricted myself to only one bite. If I go back, I'll definitely get more of that! My seafood pad thai was also good, but again, not much kick. That was my fault for not ordering higher on the spice level. 

We were seated at a rickety corner table. This isn't a fancy place by any stretch, but if you know that going in, you'll be fine. Of course, the service was a bit on the brusque side for us, but perhaps if we'd come in a little sooner, it would have been a bit more relaxed."}
{"text":"Came here for a delicious and affordable meal. My one gripe with the place is the service was really slowwww. It took 15 min before we got our order in.

I tried the Pad See Ew, Tom Yum Soup, and BBQ pork and chinese sausage fried rice. The Pad See Ew was a little too sweet for my taste, but the Tom Yum definitely hit the spot. The broth is definitely more complex than I am used to getting at other Thai restaurants. There's more richness and flavor to the broth than elsewhere. If I came back I'd definitely order the soup or the noodles available with this soup. The BBQ pork and sausage fried rice was solid as well and above average.

Keep in mind that the location is small and there may be a wait at times."}
{"text":"This is excellent Thai food. For those who like spicy food, like me, it is excellent. However if you want to have it mild you can, like my wife.  Prices are very reasonable. It is a small informal setting. I've eaten there several times and have enjoyed each time."}
{"text":"Really great take out noodles . Great flavor I usually get the duck pad Thai . Very tasty . Good price ."}
{"text":"I've been a long time customer here every time I'm in Las Vegas. Unhappy they started charged me delivery fee without notice and did not give me my fish sauce and jalapeños as requested upon delivery. That could really ruin a foodie's meal. Wish I looked thru the order BEFORE I tipped. Very unhappy."}
{"text":"Simply the best Thai restaurant in Summerlin and possibly in town! Great prices, fast service and delicious food."}
{"text":"I got this delivered by Uber eats and its some of the best chicken noodle soup I've ever had. 10/10 will eat again."}
{"text":"After reading reviews on yelp, my wife and I decided to give this place a go.  This restaurants appears nice on the outside, however, when you walk in, it is a hole in the wall place.  This restaurant is small and can accommodate up to 30 customers.  

We ordered a Beef Rad - na, Beef Pad see-ew, and a Crab Fried Rice. 
Beef Rad - na - 3 stars
- too much white pepper, but the gravy was fairly tasty
Beef Pad see-eu - 2 stars
- too much white pepper 
Crab Fried Rice - 2 stars
- too much white pepper and salt.

All of our dishes tasted like white pepper.  I noticed after the dishes went onto the serving table, the server would put an excessive amount of white pepper on each dish.   I am sad that we did not get as good of an experience as the rest of the yelpers.  This place is cheap, but I would rather pay a buck or two more for better tasting thai food."}
{"text":"I called in a delivery about an hour after they opened. Their menu online is easy to read and their website is simple and efficient. The girl on the phone and the delivery boy were both very nice and pleasant. I got the red curry- level 6- with shrimp, crab rangoons, and vegetarian egg rolls. The to-go container for the curry was a plastic tupperwear so nothing spilled! The fried items were perfectly crispy when they arrived to my door. The food was absolutely delicious! Fair portions and pricing. Everything I expect and love from Thai food."}
{"text":"First time and was very good.  Prices were very reasonable with good portions of food. 
Wife got pad Thai and I got Thai spicy noodle.  Both very pleased. 

Definitely recommend going."}
{"text":"Amazing red curry! Nice thick consistency and they always make it super spicy (just how I like it)! The tofu is also incredible. Well cooked, not soggy and very well seasoned."}
{"text":"I come to Thai Style Noodle House for one dish, the Tom Yum House Noodle Soup.  Imagine the spicy, sour-sweet Tom Yum soup but in a large bowl for one with noodles (I usually get thin noodles).   So delicious and feels up the tummy.

It is just the thing for when I am not feeling well or my stomach is not feeling great.  It is comfort food.  Get very spicy (6 or higher) to clear up your sinus.

I've tried a few of the other dishes, like Pad Thai, and they are just okay.   The portions are huge and the prices are very affordable.   Indoor space is small though so you may have to wait during prime hours.  Parking is plentiful in the plaza or across the street, in the Ranch 99 plaza.

After eating out so often, I've come to realize that a restaurant will usually have only one stellar dish.  For Thai Style Noodle House, that dish is the Tom Yum House Noodle Soup."}
{"text":"Thai Style Noodle House has always caught my eye since regular at Liu same shopping mall. Thai food is definitely one of my favorites. So was excited about coming in for lunch and trying some of the food.

I ordered the Chicken and Shrimps Silver Noodles. I was in the mood for a nice hearty noodle dish for lunch. This dish delivered on point!!! They were not skimpy on the protein either chicken or shrimp, nice amount of vegetables from bean sprouts, carrots, cabbage, and the clear noodles again nice portion size. I really liked the sauce not really heavy gravy sauce but more light sauce. Not over powering. All the vegetables had nice crunch, al dente, and looked eye appealing just looking at it. It reasonable price. Menu is pretty diverse with lots of pictures just in case not sure.

The service was excellent. I got seated soon as I walked in. Never had empty glass. The decor is pretty interesting. It had bland look too it. Sure the walls are painted so nothing like cafeteria style. On one side of the walls there couple widescreen televisions. Other then that and one sculpture that sit on the counter. Odd. Yet they have modern look between the light fixtures above and the seats. If you walk in never think going into Thai restaurant. Good or bad? It all about the food for me. In Thai Style Noodle House case am FAN. No doubt plan on making it regular lunch spot for me and trying more of the menu."}
{"text":"A great Thai place for it's cheap price, and yet authentic cooking. I ordered Panang Beef and PadThai, both were delicious. I wish it's closer to my house so that they can deliver to me. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service was good and fast. I like the ambiance of the place very purple-like and fun. Very spacious when you visit inside. By far the cleanest Thai place I've ever visited. Food was good and good location especially I don't have to drive all the way to China town for their other location!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have gotten the same thing. That's just because the soup is that good. Golden rule #1, if a place named after a dish or ingredient, get that thing! Especially if it's am Asian restaurant. Stick to the Thai noodle soups and you'll be fine, full and happy!"}
{"text":"Ok Thai food. First the place looks nice, design of the restaurant is modern and comfortable. The servers are average, nothing outstanding nor poor. They seem like they just want to get people in and out, I guess there's nothing wrong with that.

Tried the chicken Satay. Nothing special, just chicken breast on sticks. No real flavor profile. The crab fried rice was salty. The Tom yum noodle was pretty good; nicely sour with just the right amount of spicy. The fried chicken was overdone; therefore a bit dry. The Thai ice tea was very good. Most places is too sweet; it was perfect here. Thus earning three rather than two stars."}
{"text":"Mmm, Thai food.  We have a casual dating-kind of relationship going.  I can go for awhile without it, then all of a sudden have a craving that simply can't be fulfilled.  By no means am I married to one Thai place, but my favorite is still probably the one by my house.

Don't be confused, though - I still enjoy this place every now and again.  We've spent some pretty good time together.  I've actually eaten here a few times but usually I get delivery to my job.

The pad see ew is absolutely delicious - the flat noodles are nice and well-cooked, tossed with a delicious sauce, chicken and plenty of vegetables (but not too many that you feel like you're getting stiffed).

The red curry I had when I was super-congested - I believe I ordered a 5 or a 6 (their spicy scale is 1-10) - and not only was it, too, tasty, but it also allowed me to breathe with its well-placed spiciness.

The pad thai is good and reminiscent of the pad se ew but I felt it lacked a little flavor as I really enjoy that in-your-face peanut sauce that, to me, is a staple of the pad thai dish.  It had a hint of a lemon flavor, which is the biggest reason I dislike the pad thai from Le Thai, but it wasn't enough to completely turn me off to the dish.  Or maybe I was starving that day.  I don't know, but it was gone pretty fast.

Each time there's certainly been enough for two meals (I just happened to really be hungry on the pad thai day) and the prices are quite reasonable.  Delivery time can vary - once I waited almost an hour while another time it was around 20 minutes.

Give it a first date - you may end up going for a second.  =)"}
{"text":"For the price it has become my favorite spot to order and eat at. I do recommend it to everyone. The food is delicious and they get here as the time state or some times sooner."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just down the block from my house and I finally had the chance to try it out.  The restaurant has a modern vibe very clean and the waiters are very attentive. 

I ordered the combo appetizers and the three companions (chicken)  everything was delicious.
Chicken was marinated just right, papaya salad has just the right acidity and very fresh. 

Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"It used to be my favorite restaurant but not anymore after what I had today. Pineapple fried rice was so wet and plain. They used to have good pad see eeu but this time it's so plain and has almost no flavor to it. Pad Thai was so dry I feel like I'm eating old food. I'm so disappointed!!!! Time to find a new Thai restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was one of my favorite places to go to in China town. My whole family loves this place. However I brought a friend of mine recently for the first time and the meat was not cooked well it was pink. I ordered beef and chicken and they were all shade of pink. The new management is awful! I was not impressed as I used to. I hope they can improve this and return the old cook! Presentation was not the best!"}
{"text":"I don't think that it quite lived up to the hype...might have been because I ordered take-out or ordered the wrong thing? I got the Drunken Noodles and it was incredibly greasy...It also tasted a bit bland...Also wasn't the most authentic.
Maybe their noodle soups are better? I do have to say that it is very affordable, though."}
{"text":"This place is amazing,  my family and I started off going to there other location on spring mountain,  then to the one on fort apache now this location is 2 minutes from my house.  Very clean and modern.  Staff very nice.  Food absolutely delicious! Fresh and hot every time. Highly recommend,  I saw people outside reading there menu I told them try it you will not be disappointed, so they walked in and sat down :)"}
{"text":"The food was great. Tastes just as expected. Price was just right. I had ordered the panyang curry and pad thai. The place was rather small but expected. Friendly staff. Clean. Would recommend to anyone looking for good Thai food."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this restaurant for years but, as others have reviewed, it has gone downhill over the past year. The last time we dined here the establishment was nearly empty (on a weekend) and the floors, tables, and walls were filthy. The food has become overly oily and salty despite requests for less of both. The service was exceptionally poor, too."}
{"text":"Actually I want to give them zero star.  I ordered by phone  and repeated 4 times. No garlic in my food. The girl that picked up the phone said yes and ok no garlic. When I arrived there , there are garlic in my noodle. It's ok. I can wait for the new one. Instead of cooking me the new one , they just use the spoon took garlic out of my noodle. I asked her did u cook the new one ?  She said yes , it's the new one. How can she cook the new one in 1 min. I just asked for my money back and left. U made a mistake and all u have to do is cooking the new one. Don't be cheap and do like this. I'm really disappointed. It's used to be good restaurant. I always go get dinner over there. I don't know they change the owner or change the servers.  The service is getting worst.  Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Thai Style Noodle House in Summerlin is amazing, really. My friends and I have been going there at least once a week (sometimes as many as 3 times a week) and every item we have ordered has been fresh, full of rich and varied flavors, and simply addictive! Should mention we all eat Paleo most of the time and there is lots on this menu for Paleo or gluten free eaters. 

All the curries are great, our favorite remains the avocado/salmon (or shrimp) which we get them to add broccoli to as we require lots of vegetable intake. Also recommend the Chicken Satay, Ginger Snapper and do not miss the Pineapple Fried Rice which has such a special flavor. I have never been a fan of eggplant but do not miss the eggplant on this menu, it will blow you away! 

The prices simply cannot be beat. This is high quality cuisine at a truly reasonable price. 

As for the spot itself, could use some better lighting, it is just exceptionally bright. The tables are clean, the chairs really comfortable, and staff is always friendly and really knows the menu. You have to go outside to get to the bathroom around back but it is very clean. If you order take out be very careful in transport as some items are too much liquid for their take out boxes. 

Love it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch to give this spot ànother try.  I had come once before when it was a different Thai place and it was just okay, nothing great.  My sister comes regularly and said it's really good, so decided to give it another shot.

I got the shrimp and avocado curry with brown rice, so good!  My two friends also got a curry dish and enjoyed it but said mine was the best.  It was really tasty and I like the shrimp and avocado combination which is a different curry combo that I haven't seen in other places.  I usually do chicken or beef but this one caught my eye.  Will def come back as it was very yummy and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick lunch this week and man was it busy here! I didn't have to wait for a table but a lot of people that came afterwards had to wait about 10 min for one to clear up, so if it's during peak meal time, don't be in a hurry if you decide to stop by! 

I've been craving pad thai all week and decided to try theirs because of their name - Thai Style Noodle House. The noodles were good, a little thinner than I'm used to but delicious with a nice sweet flavor and were served with a side of raw/fresh bean sprouts which were a nice compliment to the noodles. The pad thai w/ pork was super cheap at $6.95! Wow, what a deal! I will definitely be coming back for more pad thai as well as to try some of their other dishes when I have more time!

Service was ok because they were so busy it seemed like the 2 waitresses were overwhelmed most of the time I was there. At the end I wanted to leave so I ended up just handing them 10 bucks as I was starting to get up to go, even though I hadn't gotten my bill yet. Again, don't come here if you're in a hurry...did I cover that enough in this review?"}
{"text":"I have had the esteemed pleasure to eat at this location twice. Both visits the food was just phenomenal. Some of the best curries I have ever had at a restaurant. I've tired the red and green curry, the salmon curry, Thai rice, and the dumplings. Which hands down those dumplings are the BEST I have ever eaten. Pair the meal with a Thai iced tea and you will not be disappointed. I cannot praise this Thai restaurant enough the food is truly delectable and the price point is perfect. A meal for two with drinks, soup, and appetizer you'll walk out under $40."}
{"text":"Great Thai spot in China Town. The food is consistently good and the menu has a nice range of options for whatever hits your spot. The portions are a good size and the price is fair. The restaurant can get noisy at lunchtime but they also deliver."}
{"text":"I think the original location is waaaay better. Had a decent selection during lunch time: beef pad see eew, combination beef noodle soup and spicy basil eggplant with tofu. My family and I originally went for the soup. I'm glad we got the two other dishes cause the soup was very lacking in flavor. The meat was dry and not tender. Pretty disappointed cause I had been craving Thai noodle soup for weeks. Service was alright, nothing real good and nothing real bad about it."}
{"text":"This was our favorite Vegas restaurant experience. It was cheap, and it was the best thai food I've had in the US (granted that I've only had thai food in a central PA college town). 

We first had fried dumplies, which had great presentation and tasted wonderful. The satay sauce that they added was particularly yummy. We then shared the payaya salad mild (thank you yelp reviewers!!!) and it was delicious and still very spicy. I had never had this dish before, and loved it.

Then, we shared Khua-Kai Rice Noodles. A giant portion of stir-fried noodles, chicken, egg, bean sprouts and green onions. All this served in a delicious slightly spicy sauce.

The place itself is very simple. About 6-8 tables, a flatscreen TV, one cook and one waitress. The place is so small that I kept wondering where they put their ingredients. 

The bill came, $20! We couldn't have been happier."}
{"text":"I waited for over twenty minutes and nothing was being served so I think the waiter forgot to put my order in! He was more intent on checking his phone in the corner than he was taking care of his customers! Won't go back!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience at all... I ordered the papaya salad Laos style and they charged a dollar extra and didn't tell me that it was extra when I ordered, I have NEVER been charged extra at a Thai restaurant for having it made Laos style.  Also, the portion size was EXTREMELY small. The order was the size of a small side item. For $9 you would expect to get a decent size plate.  I will never come to this establishment again.  Next time I will travel the distance and go to my favorite place in Chinatown. Very disappointed with this place!"}
{"text":"Comfortable chairs and booths, nice TV locations which show sports and cartoons. Prices are very fair for Thai cuisine and there is always ample seating when I come here. They are occasionally out of certain items on the menu but for me it hasn't been a common occurrence."}
{"text":"Fell in love with the Tom Yum soup!  Cute place, friendly staff, fast and inexpensive-"}
{"text":"friend suggest this place for lunch. the location is a bit of a pain in the ass to park at. friend was already there and most of the tables were taken. 

i ordered the pad thai and he had the chicken over rice.

didnt get any utensils when the food came. had to ask for utensils since there was none placed on the table.

best pad thai ive had in town and the portions were pretty big. i was stuffed after eating it.

friend suggested the pork over rice next time. sorry i dont remember the name."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here based on reviews and I must say, I thank yelp for this. I thank all of previous reviewers who had good experience with this restaurant. Away from the strip where everything is overpriced, I decided to drive out of the strip and look for something to eat. Their Pad Thai was only $6.50 or $6.99 and their duck and shrimp fried rice was only $8. But the moment we got our food, it was so much and it smelled really good. So we decided to devour it. We couldn't finish it. Their pad thai, they cooked it well with and peanuts were well spread out with the noodles that whenever you use your fork or chopstick and eat pad thai, grinded/crunched peanuts are spreaded out and stuck to the noodles that you can chew and taste it as you eat the noodles, it's well cooked.

Their duck and shrimp fried rice is well cooked and tasted really well."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best Thai food I've had since moving to Vegas. Personal fav is steamed ginger snapper."}
{"text":"Roasted duck curry for $8, you have to be kidding.  We have not gone back to any of the neighborhood Chinese take-outs since this location of Thai Noodle opened.   Their prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food.  If you go to any one of their locations be sure and try the salmon and avocado panang, original and a great balance of flavors."}
{"text":"A best kept secret! The Panang Avocado flavor blew us away. Potstickers with 3 sauces are a good pick. Shrimp Pad Thai is the best we've had in Vegas. Prices ? CHEAP!
Beer and wine license is in the works. You can bring your own bottle if you buy it have the receipt with you."}
{"text":"Prices reasonable. Most dishes $6.95, some include jasmine rice. Pad see ew just OK, flavors not complex. Green chicken curry left a lot to be desired - too salty, too many vegetables, but zero eggplant and zero basil - my least liked version of my favorite Thai dish. Even the basil stir fry had no basil ?? The tom yum was good, sour, with lots of shrimp. Thai iced tea good: large, sweet."}
{"text":"Tried the fried wontons and spicy noodles. Both were delicious. The service was quick and nice. The place is small."}
{"text":"Hit up Thai Style on the way home from taking the bus to LA - ordered up veggie egg rolls, my beloved Pad Ped Snapper, Thai Spicy Noodles and the Three Flavor Salmon - all at a 6 or so heat. The egg rolls were, again, sizzling hot and perfectly done - crispy on the outside with soft veggies on the inside.  The Noodles hit the table next - ALMOST too spicey-hot - but that really means just right. The Pad Ped was a disappointment.  A completely different preparation from the last time we had it - the breading was not thick and crunchy, but more like a light dusting of fine panko and swimming in a thin sauce (last time it was more like a paste). Don't get me wrong, this is still a great dish - just completely different from what I had experienced prior.  I had a bite of the Three Flavor Salmon - which seemed really nice and complex."}
{"text":"The tum yum seafood noodles were the best. The flavors were just right, there's were slices if pork in the soup I though were a bit dry. But Overrall the flavor was just right!! My huband got the Thai boat noodles. It was good. Good came fast after ordering it. When we walked in about 12 all the tables were taken but one near the door. As we sat there the server took quiet sometime getting our drink orders and food order. When the food came out we still didn't get out drink or forks and spoons.. I think they can work on their service skills.. I can't wait to go back for their food. And their prices were so reasonable for a Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"I got the green curry and it was delicious, but I ordered it a few levels too spicy and couldn't handle it lol. Totally my fault, not theirs. 

Our server was extremely nice and made conversation with us in between orders. The restaurant looks a little dated but it's clean. 

Try the Thai tea- it's perfectly sweetened without being overly so. 

Nice little spot to get my Thai food fix!"}
{"text":"Went to the Thai Style Noodle House for lunch today with a couple friends, (one of who is a regular there). He's addicted to the beef noodle soup, so naturally, I had to try it out as well. The first thing I noticed about this little place was the Tshirts pinned to the wall, so cheesy and SO THAI! Of course we were greeted warmly with the never fail big Thai smile from the hostess that I've come to expect from the Thais when I meet them.
There were computer printout menu items with pictures scattered around the walls as well, and coupled with the Thai TV programming and Tshirts, I was reminded of a typical Thai noodle shop one can find all over Thailand.....(sigh, I miss you).
I noticed on one of the printouts a picture of Penang Curry with avocado. One of my buddies wanted that, and when I mentioned to the waitress that he was a vegetarian, she quickly produced a completely separate vegetarian menu. That was cool, although he stuck with the avocado Penang curry with tofu. He ordered it at #9 of 10 in spiciness.
My noodle soup arrived and was promptly devoured and washed down with a Thai iced tea. The broth was hearty, the noodles soft, and there was a large chunk of baby bok choy, and plenty of bean sprouts to compliment the meatballs and sliced beef. I thought the soup could've used a touch of cilantro, but it was very good and well balanced. I also tasted some of the avocado Penang which I thought would be too hot for my tastes, but turned out to be just right. The flavor was full, yet balanced and the tofu & avocado with the coconut & curry worked well together. The portions here are large, and overall it was a good value for the money. I look forward to returning to explore the other menu items and hopefully finding another Thai gem for my palate."}
{"text":"This is a small Thai place with a BIG flavors. I found this place over 6 years ago at their first location (Spring Mtn and Wynn) and could not be happier when they finally opened one in my neighborhood. Great authentic taste, great prices, quick great service and generous portion. 

Recap of what we had this time:
Appetizer: Crispy Calamari $6.75. Delicious crispy fresh calamari. It's crispy on the outside and chewy fresh on the inside. Comes with hot and sweet sauce. 
Entree: 
- Green Curry Pork $7.25 - my husband thinks this place has the best green curry in town. Couple of my co-workers second that statement as well. One thing to be aware of: their spicy level is not the same like other Thai joint. If you do not like spicy, try to level it one or two down and you can always add more spice later on. We ordered spicy level #5. Their curry has a perfect balance of spicy anda little bit of sweetness from the coconut milk. Must try! 
- Seafood Tom Yum with Flat Rice Noodle spicy level #7-  $8.95. You can pick your own noodles: thin rice noodles, flat rice noodles, yellow egg noodles or vermicelli. This is a SPICY soup. Perfect for winter. It'll warm your body up. 
- Pad See Euw $7.25. Generous portion for the price. 
- Crispy Noodles with Seafood & Wonton (their Chef's special menu) $8.95. I recommended this dish to try, especially if you like crispy noodles. 
- Tom Kha (coconut milk soup with seafood) $7.25. If you like thai style soup but not on the sour side (tom yum), then this would be a perfect one to try. 

Desert: mango sticky rice $4.25. My favorite desert! 

We had to take some home due to their generous portion. Recommended place to go when you crave Thai food. If you pay with yelp, you'll get some cash back too!"}
{"text":"After our foot massages, we Yelped and found this place.  The food was soooo good.  I had the wanton soup and the pineapple fried rice.   That was a LOT of food, so I took some back to my hotel.  Was perfect for late night munchies.  

It's small, but we didn't have to wait for a table.  My friend enjoyed his food too."}
{"text":"We ordered the Sliced Beef Noodle Soup with egg noodles and Crab Fried Rice to go. Meat was a little tough but otherwise, great food! Very plentiful!"}
{"text":"Very solid 3 stars for me. Ordered the Penang curry which was very tasty and perfectly seasoned. The pad Thai was kind of on the sweet side for me. The pineapple fried rice was just whatever, it wasn't like OMG or anything. Kind of plain, IMHO. I would come back for the Penang curry though!"}
{"text":"Thai Food is my favorite, I love this place ,  every time we are around china town , we stop for sure at Thai style noodle house , pad Thai the best !!!!"}
{"text":"I just ordered for the first time from thai style noodle house. I ordered a beef panang curry and duxk chow mein. I usually order from  krung thai as i do eat a lot of thai food and they are my favorite for delivery but i wad teying to branch out and try something new. The panang was poor, very greasy and thinned out sauce. The chow mein wasn't actually chow meinbut instead they gave me lo mein. If any of you eat thai enough you will understand the difference between these two dishes. When i received the delivery the driver said i owed and the receipt didnt show a credit charge even though i had been sure i paid with my card. Since there was no charge receipt i trusted that it didnt go through so i paid in cash. Upon going back to my house (he also pulled up to the wrong house two streets over and i had to go find him) i saw that my card had in fact been charged and the delivery driver just walked away with my cash for a meal i had already paid for. Needless to say im not happy with this experience and the only reason they got 2 stars is because their delivery time is prompt 30 minutes flat"}
{"text":"Tastes good but be careful. I ordered my food 3/10 spicy level. But it was so spicy it upset my stomach. Soups are good. And fried rices have good combination of flavors."}
{"text":"One of the best thai places that I've been to. It is casual family style dining. No frills, but excellent food. If you are looking for a good lunch spot for family or friends, this is a place to try. Had bbq pork over friend rice and it was excellent. The bbq pork was really tender and well seasoned and the friend rice was excellent. If you are bringing a big group, you may have to wait because it is a pretty tiny place. 
I stumbled across this place because I was going to the poke place nearby, but they ran out of poke bowls. Lucky for me, this was two shops down. 
You have to be pro active at getting the wait staff's attention, but if you are not bothered by that, go for it."}
{"text":"This is family owned type of restaurant. Prices are very reasonable and the food is quite good too. Would definitely go back !"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a hole in the wall restaurant, look no further than Noodle House! This Thai place has the best service I've ever experienced in Chinatown. Normally, the service is crappy and the food is alright but here both are great! I do have to say they have opened up another place near Fort Apache, but I've never been there.

The place always has people inside and the aroma as you walk up to the door is enough to make your mouth water. 

I normally call my order in ahead of time to take my meal home, and they're pretty good at being speedy.

My favorite dish would definitely have to be the Thai fried rice with chicken. The dish has the perfect amount of onions and chicken and rice and seasonings. This dish is enough for two people or two meals for one (which is what I do).

I would also recommend #38, which is sorta like pan fried noodles with bean sprouts and a sweet/spicy sauce.

I've never had the Thai iced tea but it's a nice orange color and from what I hear, it's pretty good if you're looking for a cool refreshing drink.

It's a very small, quick and inexpensive lunch if you're looking for something new. And afterwards, you can just drive down Spring Mountain and go shopping at the Fashion Show Mall!"}
{"text":"I don't feel that the food is very authentic or at least not the way I am used to. I've had most of the things on the menu and the only things I like are the soups, basil fried rice, sticky rice, and papaya salad. All of the entrees I've had were weird and not prepared anything like I've traditionally had, plus they give a huge amount of rice per entree and in the same container so the rice gets all soggy. For the price the soups are a good value but everything else isn't because I don't feel that it's edible. The meats are always a weird texture, almost like they used canned meat or something like in the garlic pepper chicken, ginger chicken, even the fried chicken which has rave reviews was a weird orange and also soggy. How do you serve soggy fried chicken?? I've had more entrees and also ones with beef which weren't to my liking. The only things I have liked didn't have meat in them or had tofu. I'll still come here for the soups and basil fried rice, but nothing else.

UPDATE:
Gave this place another try and it was even worse than before. With all the options out there and much better customer service elsewhere I won't ever be coming back. Disgusted by the workers here...."}
{"text":"First of all $35 for an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert... can't beat the prices. No wait, went on an off time on a Monday. We ordered the yellow curry, pad thai, calamari, and Tom yum. The yellow curry, like everyone says, was freaking delicious. It tastes authentic and reminds me of when I went to south Thailand. Be careful of the spiciness though! We ordered 3s and 4s and it was a little much for me. The calamari was delicious, very crunchy and soft on the inside, would definitely recommend. I'd say the pad Thai was above average, not the best I've had but pretty good. We also ordered the sticky rice with mango, it was delicious and came in the shape of a cute little heart."}
{"text":"Went here the other day and lucky there was not a wait. It's a tiny place with maybe 10-12 tables so don't go here if you have a big party. Husband order the fried rice over fried chicken, I got the combination noodle soup with the flat rice noodle, kids order the beef pad sew ew. The portions are perfect if have your own plate but if you plan on sharing get a couple dishes. The food was ok, season in was there but the kids really love the pad sew ew. A little sweet for me but if I were to come back I'll just come for that dish. Waitress was really attentive. Overall good lunch spot"}
{"text":"This place is hidden in Chinatown & the restaurant itself is really small. It gets really busy during lunch & dinner, so much that people just order to-go or wait in line to get a table. Service is usually very fast & the waitresses are friendly. I always get my favorite, pad se-eu & mango sticky rice for dessert. Once in a while I'll try something different, like the pineapple curry (yum) & khua-kai."}
{"text":"The food was some what good, service sucks. We order four soup bowls one rice plate a salad and two appetizers. The appetizers arrived first thing rice plate ten min later with a soup bowl and salad. We got two soup bowls fifteen min after and never saw the fourth soup bowl. But she still wanted to charge us for it. Note they still charge their 20% gratuity for six people!!"}
{"text":"I love the Roasted Duck Soup!   It is the best in town.

II took My wife in the other night for a special night out on town.  We decide head to down to the Noodle House.  She got the BBQ Pork dumpling soup and I got the Roasted Duck soup.  This was simply perfection.  The Duck was so tender and boneless.   One of the Best things is the size of the portions, which is huge.  

I just love this place and it is one of my favorite places to eat out!!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little hole in the wall place. I'm personally not a huge fan of Asian food BUT their stuff is GREAT, and a good price. The inside seating area is real nice and it's a good place enjoy a good meal."}
{"text":"The service here is so slow. I order ed my food at 430 Pm and its still now done. Hurry up."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a little grimy. We walked in and felt as if there may be something going on in the back.  Maybe the restaurant was just a cover for a massage parlor or high stakes poker game. The available tables were sloppy, and greasy -with dirty dishes everywhere. Not a good first impression to say the least.....

After looking over the menu, we decided to give it a shot. My wife ordered 2 entrees (she is not fat I swear). First, she ordered the beef Thai noodle soup. The broth was fantastic, however the beef was fatty --EWWWW. 

Her second entree was the cashew chicken. Not bad, but we have had much better versions of this dish in the Las Vegas area. I decided on the chicken basil fried rice-level 5. The rice was a little greasy, but very good. I am glad I didn't go over a 5 on it-- it had some heat!  Our total bill with soft drinks came out to about $25.00. 
This place isn't bad, but I don't think I would go out of my way to come back. If I do, I'll make sure to bring money for the buy-in so I can sit on on the game going on behind the scenes."}
{"text":"Omg horrible service never coming back here again! I've given this place plenty of shots to prove me wrong but it just keeps getting worse and worse this time they took 20 minutes to sit us than another hour for me to get my food. The place was not even that busy. I'm done here!"}
{"text":"Tom Yum Goong is my favorite Thai soup. The ones I have tried at the last few Thai restaurants were not satisfying or just disappointing. When I saw that they have Tom Yum seafood noodle, I was intrigued since I haven't had it with noodles and seafood other than shrimp before. 

They have an option of four different noodles. I chose the flat, wide rice noodles. The broth was so satisfying and flavorful. I went with spice level 5 which turned out to be just the right spice level. I loved it with the noodles, fish cakes, squid, etc. After I finished my soup, I already knew I would be back for this delicious, hearty, satisfying soup."}
{"text":"Update: ordered pick up and the lady on the phone was rude af! Started with her asking \"which location are you ordering from?? I need to here it from you! We have 4 locations!\" Then just straight monotone and no help to my questions. Like are you just a lonely lady with a stick up her butt 24/7?? Go work at a place that requires no customer service like a janitor or something.

Just got my food. Ordered a 0 for spicy. Butgot like a 3... wtf


I've been to this location twice. Ordered the same thing both times. 1 to go and for dine in. The portion for the pad Thai was the same. The portion for the deep fried calamari is half of what it looks like on the menu. The pad see-eu was a huge difference. When I got it to go, my box was filled. When I received my food for dine in, the portion was only half of what I go for dine in. It only took up half the plate. Keep in mind, the box is a lot bigger than than plate. 

Overall, the food is good. Just keep in mind that the portions here are inconsistent. I'll give it a 3 for now"}
{"text":"This place is great. Our office orders from here often. Today we all came here for lunch to change up our day. Its a great place for delivery and ear in. Yum!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars

Beware of the spiciness level. 1-10, we got a 6 and it was pretty spicy, and I can usually handle spicy.

Papaya salad: sooo good, one of the best papaya salads I've ever eaten. Very refreshing, and the level 6 spiciness was just enough kick.

Duck fried rice: another 5 star dish, highly recommended

Tom Yum Noodle Soup: deliciousness continues, the soup base is perfect.

Panang Avocado: this is the only dish I didn't really like. We requested salmon and shrimp, but only got shrimp, they forgot the salmon.

VERY AFFORDABLE. Cheap and delicious food, what more can I ask for

Service was alright, typical of an Asian restaurant, understaffed so they weren't very attentive."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great foodie find!  Though it is located off the strip, this place is well worth it, especially if you are dining on a budget.  Prices are really decent and food here is very good.  I ordered their yellow curry with chicken. I was very pleased as they used white meat chicken as opposed to dark meat, which I dislike.  Portion was very generous and the overall taste was good.  A great deal especially since it was only $6.75 for my meal.   Some of the other members of my party ordered their duck soup and said it was delicious. Pad thai and pad see ewe are pretty tasty too.  

My hubby and I use to dine at Archie's off Flamingo as they have pretty good food too, but in comparison to this place, their prices are higher and portions not as generous.  

TIP:  Skip the overpriced Thai/Asian Restaurants located inside the hotels on the strip.  Food is just ehh and not to mention, they hurt the pocket.  This place has pad thai for $6.75 while the Lemongrass located in the Aria Hotel has it for $16-20 a plate. (I am not exaggerating either!) Taste wise and price wise, Thai Style Noodle House is wayyy better."}
{"text":"My father works in the area, and after his own ravings, I had to try Noodle House.

When entering, the front room appears to be dirty, or, at least, the windows do. The tables, chairs, yadda yadda are all pretty good. (Honestly? Asian places are best when they look kinda dirty.) But don't let that deceive that.

The food? Pretty darn good. I personally had a bowl of Tom Kha, otherwise known as Tom Yum with coconut milk. The chicken was of good quality, although the amount of mushrooms definitely left me wanting more. The broth had a great taste, and for the value, the dish was massive. However, that's also it's downfall. While the broth was rich and great, I couldn't bring myself to finish it. Because of it's large amount, the broth by itself is a bit rancid and difficult to eat without any other ingredients, mostly because of its silky smooth texture.

My sister had the Appetizer sampler, complete with the great chicken kabobs, well made crab rangoons, typical egg rolls, and sadly disappointing fried tofu. It was too thin and dry to properly eat.

My favorite dish, however, were the flat Thai spice noodles. The beef had a succulent taste, and the fried noodles were delicious and melted in your mouth. It may have been one of the best thai dishes I had ever had -- even the amount of spice was perfect!

The value alone makes Thai Style Noodle House a must visit. While the rest of their Thai dishes are certainly great, I'll definitely be coming back for the namesake."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. The management is very rude. Gf ordered the beef noodle soup,and ask if it had a lot of vegetables in it.The waiter said yes. When we got the bill they added a dollar more to the price! All this without informing of the extra charge! And the beef was so tough she couldn't eat it! When we made the complaint to the manager she ignored us and didn't even apologize! Food is not as expected. Noodles were overcooked. The people are not customer oriented. We are not going to come back. First time here and the last! 
."}
{"text":"Good noodles, i tried the beef larb. There was more carrots than meat. Super disappointing"}
{"text":"The prices here are actually really cheap, so that's a plus! However, it's equivalent to the portion they give you, so I guess it's the same. 

I had the Pad Thai with chicken. They use the small/thin rice noodles that is used for Pho, so that was a bit different from the authentic Pad Thai. The dish was really really sweet, so I didn't enjoy it-- too much tamarind and sugar perhaps. When I come here next time, I'll probably order something else. 2/5 for their pad thai

They were really nice though. They came to refill our water a couple times and check up on us and provided us with everything we needed. We had a large party, of about 10 people or so, so I think their service was great! 5/5 for service!"}
{"text":"This place was average at best. Smaller than expected and the food wasn't all that good. Prices were average for Thai food. Service was just ok. I doubt I'd go again"}
{"text":"Quick easy and so so tasty. This place has to be my favorite restaurant. The vibe is very laid back the staff is incredibly friendly, the prices are unbeatable and the food is amazing.  I usually get the pad see eu, pad Thai, and sticky rice, their Mongolian beef is really good too. My dad usually gets the soups here and he loves them all. I highly recommend anyone to try this place if you're in need of a new Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Out of all the places to choose from in Chinatown this place is awesome. The pad Thai is what I usually get to compare to other Thai places. If they do this well the rest of the menu usually follows suit. Great flavors in the pad Thai and the Thai tea. Loved the pot stickers sauce. Definitely will be returning again."}
{"text":"Delicious! After a few days in Vegas, we just wanted to get some healthy, non-deep-fried food, and this place hit the spot. Pad See Ew was really flavorful, as was the Panang Avocado curry(just regular Panang Curry but they add chunks of avo to it along with the other veggies). The Thai Iced Tea was also delicious. Just the right amount of sweetness, but the tea was strongly brewed, too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Where ever I feel like eating a quick,tasty, cheap meal, I come here. My favorite dish is the duck noodle soup with vermicelli. Another one of my favorite dishes is the avocado Panang with salmon. Sometimes the Salmon is over cooked. I guess it depends which cook is back there for the night. 
Papaya salad is also good. I get the Laos style. It's more spicy and potent in flavor! But also... It depends which chef is making it. It's a little inconsistent. 
If your looking for a cheap, tasty Thai meal Thai style noodle house is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the Thai noodle house on the west side of town (ft apache), but I was strolling through china town today so I decided to stop in for my usual duck noodle soup and Panang avocado curry. I must say... This is the same restaurant but the quality n quantity is different. The curry was bland n watery and the Thai tea tasted like water down milk. Although this location gives you a bigger portion the quality of the food was not up to par w their sister location... So if you want QUALITY OVER QUANTITY visit their other location on fort apache."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places in Vegas, and they fixed my one complaint about the place, they remodeled it so it looks way better!!!!

Grilled beef salad, pineapple fried rice, pad se ew with shrimp *shoves face into food*

One of my Vegas top 10 for sure!!!!  Don't expect to get the greatest service because you are not paying that much for the food.  But don't get me wrong, everyone is really nice and courteous, just don't expect a sommelier (I googled the spelling of that) to explain their wine list to you.  The place is packed, sometimes you gotta wait a while to get a table, sometimes you will be ignored when you want someone to take your order, sometimes you may feel rushed.  But you know what?  It's still THAT good, and everyone comes back.  

Speaking of thai food, can someone invent a somewhat healthier version of Thai Iced Tea?!?  We have invented cellular phones, we send space ships to the moon, but we can't make a healthy Thai Iced Tea???!!!!!!  I was excited earlier, but now I am upset!!"}
{"text":"we had dinner on tuesday november 23rd at thai style noddle house. the apatisers were really good but the wonton soup was terrible. it was bland and the meat was a mystery meat!!!! we also ordered the pad thai and it was terrible, bland and the noodles were soggy. when we asked for the pad thai to be taken off of our bill we were told we ordered it and we were stuck with it!!!!!!!!!  we would never recommend this resturant and wonder how they received a 4 star rating???????????????"}
{"text":"I didn't pay attention to the address, so not sure if this is the right restaurant since there are other restaurants with the same name. Anyways, nothing too special here if you've eaten at other Thai restaurants. I do want to comment on their Pad Thai --it's really delicious. I've had many other Pad Thai from various Thai restaurants, and this one is absolutely delicious. I highly recommend you eat here and try it."}
{"text":"I have to update mostly on the service because the food is still the same (amazing haha). 

They have gotten so much better!! A smile every time I come in and they actually check up on me a few minutes after the food is dropped. They are quick on the refills and I'm just sooooo much happier with the service."}
{"text":"I been to a lot of Thai Restaurant here in Vegas. And yet this place is my number one choice! I absolutely love the service and the food is great! I always get spicy basil chicken fried rice with yellow chicken curry! The seafood tom-yum is on point! Papaya salad is decent, cause my mom makes the best so I can't compare. Other then that this place is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Sa wat dee - First timer to Thai Style Noodle House and would come back. Pleasant service and good lunch specials. I tried the pad si ew with chicken which you can get with spicy level 1-10. I chose 7 which was a good amount of heat but no tears. Overall good entree, plenty of Chinese broccoli and they didn't skimp on the chunks of chicken. The sauce was just right, not dry and overly saucy. 4/5 for my meal.

There were other items I would like to try on the menu like the crab fried rice or the shrimp over fried rice. There were also plenty of noodle options. Khorb Kuhn Maak!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch based on the reviews and was so disappointed. First of all, they charge 15% service fee for a party of six or more. Really? It's more of a fast food place than a restaurant. The food was less than mediocre. The orange chicken was horrible. The thai noodle that is supposed to be like \"thai boat noodle\" was bland. I could have made it better. This place is totally not worth it. I wouldn't give it one star."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! It's a diamond in the rough and I take all my friends here for Thai food! I usually get the duck fried rice with some Tom yum soup! Also the service is so great and they always have a smile on their face!"}
{"text":"This best food in Las Vegas!

I am planning my day for tomorrow and deciding when I am going to fit Thai Style Noodle House into my schedule.

Best soup ever, but I am going to try something new.  No doubt it will be the highlight of my day."}
{"text":"My favorite Asian place so far in Vegas. My boyfriend and I were going once a week at one point we kind of slowed down since we moved to North Las Vegas. We went back though about two weeks ago and the servers remembered us and were super nice as usual. I just had really Meh Asian food on the East side and I wanted to give some love to some good food!"}
{"text":"Seafood Tom Yum Noodle Soup: This was really disappointing. My dish only came with ONE shrimp and that was the $2 price difference between the chicken and seafood version. There were 3 fishballs that were halved. That makes up the seafood version. Totally not worth it. As for the soup, there seem to be something missing (either galangal or lemongrass). It was also not sour enough. Definitely pass on this dish.

Parking is terrible. The restaurant is located in the tiny shopping plaza filled with tons of restaurants which makes parking nearly impossible.

Also they served the noodle soup with the tiniest spoon. Looked like it belonged to some kid's play set."}
{"text":"Just went yesterday and the food was pretty good. However the ambiance wasn't very welcoming and the service wasn't very good. The people didn't bring even bring us napkins and they never checked up on us. It seemed like they had an attitude, but could be because we got there late. I got the Thai chili noodles I think which were really good and the 5 level of spiciness was perfect."}
{"text":"So I don't crave Thai food often. And when i do crave it from time to time. This is one of the few places I'll go to in town. I'm very picky when it comes to Thai food. These folks have the fix I need. Best appetizer I've had is the crisp squid. Not too battered and not too chewy. It has the right amount of crisp and bite. Great Papaya salad and pork w/sticky rice combo. The Red or Yellow curry is a must. And if you get the Pad See Eww. Make you sure you get the combo (all kinds of meat and shrimp) style. Be forewarned that if you order a level 10. On the spicy scale....you'll be sweating bullets! Lol"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to this location. The restaurant is always empty which is somewhat a plus for people who just wanna get in and out. I give 3 stars for the customer service. The other two stars are for my experience and inconsistency. Wait time for the food is never more than 10-15 minutes which is great, however the pictures on the menu are somewhat misleading. I ordered their deep fried calamari twice and both times the portions were really small compared to the picture they have on the menu. There's only 10 tiny pieces of calamari for $6.75. I could get triple the portion for just a couple bucks more elsewhere.

Upon arrival, My boyfriend and I were seated in a booth. The booth that we were seated in was kind of uncomfortable for me bc my seat seemed to be broken? It felt as if I was sliding off my seat the whole time. But it was fine.

Aside from that, their pad Thai ($7.25) and pad see-eu ($7.25) is amazing. Very tasty, and I love how you can customize the level of spice to each dish. The portion is perfect for sharing also.

In conclusion, this place has good Thai food for  decent prices."}
{"text":"This review is on service alone. We felt as if we were bothering the servers. They were chatting the whole time, sitting at a table for 2. We were the only guests in the restaurant and we had to interrupt their conversation for a refill of iced tea and then another time for our bill."}
{"text":"Called and placed my order. Was told told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  I arrived 10 mins after I called and waited 20 more mins. People came in  after me were seated and got there food. When I finally received my food and took it home it was cold. Never going here again. And not to mention the fried wonton was fried so hard I could barely eat and. And nothing was inside of them ."}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting Las Vegas and we stopped in for some Thai food.  The food was good.  If I were a local, I would eat there often. I can't give it 5 stars.  It has nice food but it is just a little hole in the wall with good food, especially for the money.  Lots of choices.  VERY reasonably priced. We ordered yellow curry, som thom, phad thai, and mango sticky rice for dessert.  Lots of food for an excellent price."}
{"text":"I came here this resent sunday....I thaught it was chinese new years this week.Well i was rong its next week.I came here with my nanny and my friend Kenny.I got chicken chow mein with no veggies like always,my Nanny got chicken wing appitizer,and kenny got the lunch combo plate,with kungpoa beef,and chicken with brocli.He told her he wanted the beef very spicy,she asked from 1 to 10 how spicy,he said 9.

Chicken wings-pretty big,CRUNCHY,and mostly all white meat sooo good,it came with sweet and sour sause ill defently get these again.

 Chow mein-read my other review.

Kung pow beef-For being 9 out of ten spicy....it could have been spicier.But it was very spicy and very flavorful i realy liked it alot.I think next time ill get this one :)"}
{"text":"The Tom Yum Kah soup did not come with anything but a few pieces of chicken and soup. There were no signs of mushroom, onions, or tomatoes as described on the menu. It was pretty sad, so I ordered a side of flat noodles to go with it. It filled me up, but I would never order here again. This place will save you a couple dollars, but there are way better Thai restaurants that are worth the extra $ like Archi's, Chada, or Weera."}
{"text":"I was here couple time for lunch, both times were busy. The food is not bad compare to spring mountain location. We went here for dinner time, the food was way better. Chicken mint, pai tai, pai see ew, and chicken satay were awesome. We thought we have to take them go, but they all gone. The quality and quantity are great. During dinner time is not busy like lunch time. It was quite nice and we enjoyed it a lot with thunder storm and lightning outside. Definitely we will go there dinner again."}
{"text":"Thai style noodle house, you really disappoint me. We've been customer for many years and food is great along with the price, but to order BBQ pork and Chinese sausage fried rice along with special request to add basil in it will cost additional $2.75? Are u kidding me?!?. Just don't ask these servers , where is Ling, Ling. we miss ya!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the restaurant as they are very clean and very friendly/customer service .. The food is awesome .. I rated it four stars do to the size of the restaurant .. Too small and crammed of an area."}
{"text":"Visit #3:

I recently had the Chu-Che Salmon, which is a salmon dish with a panang-like curry.  This was a very good dish, with a strong, flavorful curry.  The salmon was nicely cooked with a hint of char.  There was a white, creamy sauce on top of the salmon that helped push the taste of the curry over the top for me.  The panang was slightly thick, as panangs tend to be.  I was very impressed with the flavor, much better than the last curry I had here... not sweet, and full of unique flavors.  Apparently this is a new dish, and if this is any indication of the potential flavors of the other curries, maybe my last visit was a fluke.  I am officially putting Thai Style Noodle House on my Best of Thai list!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD.  I was staying at Mandalay Bay and they didn't have very many vegetarian choices.  A Yelp search led me here and it was SO worth it.

The food is cheap and delicious and do not let the hole in the wall vibe deter you.  We had an appetizer, two dishes, and two drinks and the bill was only $25.

Pad thai was delicious and not too greasy.  The veggie pot stickers appetizer was a pleasant surprise.  The plating looked similar to something that you would see at a sushi restaurant.  

If you are looking for something cheap and vegetarian, go here."}
{"text":"The foods amazing and comes out fast. Overall the menu is really affordable. The restaurant is nice and comfortable, a great place for a date or to go out and eat with some friends. The people are nice and answer any questions you have. If you call in to make a order it's made fast and fresh. One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas and definitely the best Thai restaurant here."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in for an impromptu lunch to go. He told me that he wanted to take me to his secret Thai restaurant that he thinks is bombb, but doesn't know the name of it because it doesn't have a sign on the door. After I parked and walked up to it, I was like oh duh, Thai Style Noodle House and jumped on Yelp to see what I should get. First off, I recall people mentioning that they may not give lunch menus unless you ask, so we sat down & searched for the lunch menu, but it was nowhere to be found. I ask the waitress & boom, out comes the lunch menu. I think it's $5.50 for 1 entree & $7.something for 2. 

When my friend orders, she asked him what level spiciness 1-10, but I was still debating if I should go healthy and get a salad or order some yummy lunch specials. It took me awhile to order & the waitress asked me instead if I want mild, medium, or hot for my spicy eggplant with beef and green curry with chicken. I thought that was weird, but I got hot (whatever that means). Lunch specials also come with a choice of eggroll or fried tofu & a little salad. We got home & dug in. The spicy eggplant was nothing special and the green curry was not as basil-y as others I've tried. The vegetables in the green curry were kind of funky, as in, they weren't very bountiful or filling and I have no idea what anything else was other than the green beans (even those I'm uncertain of). Anyway, my other complaint is that \"hot\" was not hot. My 2 year old was digging in, and she's not one for super spicy foods. Overall, I'd say lunch specials are fair and the food was alright. I'd come back to try the noodles someday, if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great food! Great staff!  Great price!  Always stop in when I'm in the area.  I love the Thai Tea."}
{"text":"Before I hit my errands, I need some fuel for my mind and body. So what better way to fill my tank up with my favorite Thai restaurant. I actually drove down the street to drop off my clothes to the dry cleaners and next to it was a Thai place to eat, but even that couldn't stop me from driving another three miles to eat where my heart tells me.

I was greeted ever so kindly when I walked in and it wasn't surprising that almost every seat was taken. Luckily it was only me, myself, and oh yea I that wanted to dine here this day. The server asked what I wanted to drink, unfortunately they didn't have the Chrysanthemum tea, so I did my usual hot tea, but even that is soothing and delicious... tasted like a light caramel tea, but it's really jasmine tea. I was debating on the Duck Fried Rice, since Lily (server) recommended it when I ate there a couple of months ago. But I wanted some soup for my soul, because today was a very chilly and windy day. I ordered the Chicken Tom Yum Noodle Soup, Flat (fat shoe lace) Noodles, since it just makes it more delicious to me... mild (5) for how spicy I want it and this time I didn't want to torture myself as I usually do ha! and extra diced garlic.. what??!? I love garlic ok it does the body good! The soup came out in zero time and I loved the way it smelled. The steam evaporated in the air in slow motion, made it looks so heavenly fresh and I had to take a snapshot of it against the sun.. it just looked so Food Digest front cover magazine-ish. I sipped the soup broth first, it was like liquid nitrous for my engine.. my eyes lit up and made my facial muscles break a happy smile. I literally said Mmmmm gulping it down... Yea tell me about it... sound good right??!? It tasted so good, my own body melted. It had bits of cilantro, diced green onion, bean sprouts, and TONS of chunky sliced white chicken meat. Loved the flat fat noodles... it was just the right amount to make me a full bear, where I could hibernate right then and there. 

But all that time I was enjoying my soup, I was also craving their Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice. I ordered that dessert right after and when it came out.. I heard from the table across from me whispering.. that dessert looks so good!! And then all this time, two guys watched me devour my lunch and then this delicious dessert... I heard him say to his friend.. Dayam that girl can eat!!! Dayam right I can!??!! I'm not shy when it comes to eating and definitely will eat to my heart's content, bet your butt I will! So I just smiled at the guys and kept on eating. I'm enjoying my meal, so let it be! The dessert was the icing on the cake... the finishing touches of a great phenomenal meal. The mango was riped and perfect to eat. Every bite of the sticky rice was warm, soft, and soothing. Loved the coconut milk that drizzled down every time I took a slice from it. The ratio between the mango slices and sticky rice was even to every single bite I took. Absolutely loved this dessert. It's my favorite Thai dessert from any other. 

Their food has been consistent every single time I have gone here and the service is always very attentive and friendly. Refilled my tea without being asked and always came back to see how I'm doing. Loved the fact that after I finished my dessert, the server asked if there was anything else I would like haha I could possibly go for another dessert, but no I'll definitely be hibernating in that restaurant if I did. I always leave so happy and satisfied... No joke. And off I went to do my errands... it was a great day for another great Thai food experience."}
{"text":"Little small restaurant, but cheap thai food around $7 a plate and thai tea $2 :D Pad see eu is normally too saucy but they balanced it just right!"}
{"text":"I ate at this place as a regular, and used to order delivery from their Chinatown location more often than I'd like to admit since 2011 or 12. Back then, my review would be 4 or 5 stars.

Then came the day where they put big ol hunks of CHICKEN in my vegetarian spicy eggplant with fried tofu!!!! And now, I just literally can't even...

So if you are veg inclined, do exercise caution."}
{"text":"Like this restaurant very special love the food this is the second time i been here I will recommend this place"}
{"text":"It's my party & I'll Thai if I want to!

This Thai-ny restaurant may be petite but they pack huge flavor into their dishes. They have multiple locations, however, the chef at this location is our favorite! The portions are generous and the flavor is always on point. The ambiance is dive-y and at times the service may seem scattered, but this place stays busy since the food is En-Thai-cing! For lazy weekend nights, we always order take-out from this place without a second thought. The Appe-Thai-zing food keeps us coming back!

Items we tried:

* Beef pad see ew $6.95 - Really juicy! We order this dish every single time we dine here and it's always delicious! They're very generous with the wide noodles. The sauce is an explosion of flavor, mixed with lots of Chinese broccoli, fluffy egg soaked in all of that tasty sauce and nice amount of tender beef. Everything is cooked expertly! Rated: 5/5

* Green curry chicken fried rice $7.95 - This is another dish we can't get enough of! A flavor bomb of deliciousness! The spices and green curry flavor comes through strong, very aromatic. There are long beans added for texture, bamboo shoots, basil, carrots and green bell pepper. We're always satisfied with the flavor of this dish! Rated: 5/5

* Panang avocado $8.95 - This is my first time trying avocado in of a warm curry and let me tell you, it works, very well! The perfectly ripe avocado is added like a garnish at the very end when serving, so it doesn't really get cooked. It adds such a wonderful silky and buttery texture to the curry! I'm a huge fan! Rated: 5/5
 
* Combo Appetizer sampler $8.95 - It comes with 1 eggroll, 2 crab Rangoon, 2 fried shrimp, 2 fried wonton, 2 chicken satay, 2 fried tofu. It's a good-sized starter for 2 people, maybe 3. I enjoy the Rangoon and also the fried tofu is fried to crispy perfection. I love their house made sauces that's served with the appetizer, there's a peanut and a sweet and sour sauce one; I want to dip everything in them! Rated: 3/5

* Papaya salad $6.50 - It's a traditional spicy and sour salad made from shredded unripe papaya mixed with long beans, tomato, toasted and crushed peanuts and served with a side of cabbage. You can pick your spice level when you order. The flavor was balanced and the spice level was perfect. I really loved their version, but I felt the portion was small. Rated: 4/5

* Pad ped snapper $8.95 (Thai curry stir fried with crispy red snapper mixed with bamboo, bell, young pepper seed, basil and baby corn) - The red snapper filets weren't too crispy and might be from the frozen section of the market, but the sauce is where it's at! The caramel sauce was packed with deep flavor, it was hard not to like this dish. I just wish they were more generous with the sauce, pouring it over rice was awesome! Rated: 3/5

* Pad Thai $6.95 - Their version here will do just fine, but it's not my favorite. I feel that the sauce is lacking much needed, bold tamarind flavor. Usually it tastes like it's missing something. Rated: 3/5

* S11 guay-teaiw-loard $8.25 (Chicken, shrimp, squid, tofu, mushroom, with black soy sauce served over steamed flat noodle and bean sprouts)  - The wide noodles are always a favorite, but the salty and sweet soy gravy was very potent and almost killed the palate. There was a prominent ginger aroma and flavor throughout the dish. However, the overwhelming amount of bean sprouts and the protein was unidentifiable, making this dish unexciting. Rated: 2/5

*PRO TIP* add fried or soft tofu to any of these dishes to add some more protein and another dimension of texture! So good!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive authentic Thai restaurant in Chinatown.  The food though was kind of average.  I had the pork larb, which was nothing special, and \"beef jerky\" which wasn't that good (Lotus of Siam is 5x better for both of these dishes).  I would go back to try other things on their interesting and varied menu.  Although there is a lot, it was hard to find parking."}
{"text":"I got the Pad Thai because I like to use it as a comparison plate that all Thai places have. Their Pad Thai was flavorful, fresh and one of the best plates I've ever had. Definitely as good or better as Archi's or Pink Kaow. The portion size was big too. Very filling.

The service was very good for lunch time and the prices are awesome. There is no lunch special because their regular prices beat most lunch specials. 

Overall the experience was very nice and that fact that all of it was just $7 is incredible. Amazing place I'll be back to weekly for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is okay. I went with my family while they were here visiting me in Vegas.

We ordered three dishes for the four of us: chicken pad thai, beef noodle soup, and a dish with thick, flat noodles with eggs, meat and a little bit of veggies.

I requested the chicken pad thai to be spicy. She asked me \"how spicy on a scale of 1-10?\" I said 7. Fast forward 8 minutes later, my pad thai was NOT spicy AT ALL. =/ What the.... hmmm. So either they completely forgot about adding any spiciness to my dish OR a 7 is considered mild. Can someone clarify how this whole spicy rating works???? Is 1 super spicy or vice versa?

If I go to any thai restaurant, I gotta order either a thai iced tea or a thai iced coffee. My sister and I ordered a iced tea and iced coffee respectively.

Prices were pretty good. Our dishes were between $6-8 and our drinks were about $1.75 each.

Oh and one more thing, very small tight space. So if you're claustrophobic or you don't like sitting superclosetothetablenexttoyou, then I suggest going somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food is ok.... I order red curry at a 7 and it is NEVER hot as I like..... also if you are in there either the day before or after a \"holiday\" they DO NOT offer the lunch special.  We went the day after New Year's day and they said it was still a holiday.... I said well technically it is not a holiday.  oh well"}
{"text":"As for so many other incredible \"gem\" finds, I have a trusted Yelp bud to thank for this one. Feeling under the weather a few months ago and craving spicy soup, I turned to my foodie Jedi Master, Kevin P for sage (and nearby) wisdom. Of course, he knew that this Chinatown staple had opened in our hood. Shares a car park with Smith's/German Bread Bakery, etc @ Rampart and Lake Mead. 

They do deliver, but a GF was kind enough to bring me spicy noodle soup (ordered 10/10 was more Ike an 8, but hit the spot) Like the original, they are known for their duck and it is an add on in many dishes; carnivore friends love it, not my thing. Drunken Noodles are a favorite and tasty and their curries are delicious. Really love that they inquire if you are vegan when you ask a dish to be prepared meat free and their willingness to change dishes for those of us who have restrictions. 

The value cannot be overstated: you easily get two meals from every portion here without compromising great taste. The decor is pretty, service is charming and on point and by now we all know the restroom is outside. Dining in is a lovely experience as the dying art of customer service with a smile abounds here. 

Over the course of several months, we've  ordered them in for Board Meetings, spontaneous gatherings and take and go a half dozen times. Everyone is equally astonished at location, quality and ROI. 

Almost glad to have had whatever the strange malady was which haunted my first week or so of year, as Kevin directed me to a clearly outstanding and unassuming place I'll continue to patronize and suggest to others. Now that they know me, I get my 10/10 spicy level and more. Welcome addition to the hood fo sho!

{"text":"Just went for my first time. Food is amazing! Prices are fair too. Just wish I was treated better. The lady who helped me was rude and decided to help other customers behind me before even greeting me. If it weren't for that, I would have given five stars. Knocked off two stars because I was so offended."}
{"text":"This is a take out sport for sure. I wanted to sit down and they tried to sit us at the table the worker had been sitting at playing on his cell phone. When I asked if they had something away from the door because it was very cold, they said that they had already closed the dining side(more than two hours before closing). He sat us away from the door but then we had a bout five different servers come over and try and take our order when we had barely looked at the menu. We were kind of rushed. When our food came out my boyfriend tasted mine and said \"this has an interesting flavor, but I don't want to tell you what it is(he knew I'd send it back or not eat it) a few bites in I figure out that they had burnt my food and scraped it out of the pan as I found the \"char\" and saw black pieces floating around in my noodles. I just paid and got out of there. I will never be back."}
{"text":"Ordered:

Fried Chicken over Fried Rice (2/5)
Pad See Ew - Beef (3/5)
Thai Spice Noodles - Chicken (2/5)
Silver Noodle Salad - Shrimp (3/5)
Orange Chicken (3/5)
Khua Kai Noodles (3/5)

Tried their other dishes for the first time and didn't like them.  Starting see the separation between this place and Lotus of Siam more and more.  Maybe the quality has gone down or just wishful thinking because of the low prices."}
{"text":"Their food continues to be delicious every time I dine with them.  Customer service is good and friendly.  Food comes out promptly and fresh, no matter how busy they are.

I love their Yen Ta Fo, Pad Thai, and chef's special (a dish with papaya salad, sticky rice, and grilled chicken or pork).  

Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Dinner Total With Tax: $20.40 - Very cheap! 

We ordered: 
1. Pad thai with chicken (with spicy #8) $6.75
2. Pad see-eu / pad see ew with beef (with spicy #7) $6.75
3. Vegetarian egg-rolls (4 pcs) $4.95

Taste: 3 stars - Our takeout pad thai was on the dry side - we prefer our noodles moist and juicy! On the other hand, our pad see ew was cooked very well, the noodles were moist and the beef was tender. Yet, both noodle dishes were lacking much salt and sweetness. We were expecting bold, vibrant, Thai flavors, but instead the flavors of the noodle dishes fell flat. I favored the moist pad see ew over the dry pad thai. The veggie eggrolls were crispy, but sadly not stuffed to the max with veggies. However, their homemade sweet and sour sauce was amazing! I would order extra sauce next time. 

Value: 5 stars - Wow! 2 dinner portions and an appetizer was $20! They were generous, even on takeout orders. They didn't skimp on any of the noodle dishes, lot's of meat and lots of noodles. It's hard to find decent local food on a bargain budget, but here it is! 

Service: 5 stars - The lady was very friendly over the phone and she also gathered up thai bird chilies in fish sauce and jalapeños in vinegar for us, as we requested. Even though we were the last customers in the door for the evening, she was still happy and helpful. 

Spice levels: 2 stars - Not very spicy. The spicy levels here are not true to taste. We ordered the pad see ew with spicy #7. In all honesty, we both felt that it was not a true 7, and more like a spicy #2. It wasn't spicy at all. We could of easily asked for a spicy 10 and enjoyed it. We also tried the pad thai with spicy #8, yes, it had minor heat, but more like a spicy #5. It wasn't spicy enough for us. (Note, we are avid spice fans. We love the burn!)

Would we eat here again? Oh hell yus!! Nothing a little salt can't fix."}
{"text":"Fairly decent Thai food, and this place gets a huge local following, if the crowds are any indication. So much so, in fact, that like many of the establishments at this Asian strip mall, it's often filled to the brim with locals, and the staff - bless them - often have trouble keeping up, no matter how much they try to keep their game face on. 

It's a tiny, postage stamp-sized shop with room for about 30 people max, and it's packed very tightly. It's less about the ambience than it is a large, comprehensive menu of simple, cheap, decent Thai food."}
{"text":"The best thai food in vegas!  My favorite are the shrimp pad thai and duck noodle soup.  Always fast and polite service!"}
{"text":"Those of us that call southwest Las Vegas home know that the Thai Style Noodle House has been a number of different places over the years... But this time I think we have found something that will stick.  I am a huge Thai food fan, and can report that this place meets all the standards.  They offer delivery, takeout and have improved the dinning room to make it so that you don't want to just get it to go. So give this place a try!"}
{"text":"You cannot beat their lunch specials Monday-Sunday 11-4pm.  Two entrees, soup, appetizer for under $8.00.  I had the yummy mint chicken and spicy eggplant with eggdrop soup and fried tofu - great stuff!  They have extended their dining area and updated the decor since they first opened.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Yum. Big bowls. Khua-Kai Rice Noodle  combination is beef, pork, chicken, and shrimp. Great sauce and bean sprouts underneath were nice and chilled. Seafood soup is a little spicy, but delicious. Plenty of shrimp and mussels. Out of duck. A very busy hole in the wall place, but well worth it. Try to come during non-peak hours and the experience is better. When you tire of the endless buffets and out of the bag foods, come here a for great meal that is filling and not expensive."}
{"text":"Panang shrimp is good as well as the BBQ wonton soup but the Duck noodle soup wasnt good at all. Prices are cheap cause portions are small. 

As for service, it sucks. I told the server nicely that I didn't like the duck noodle soup  she gave me a nasty look.

I'm not coming back here. So many other Thai/noodle places around town that's so much better."}
{"text":"Add this restaurant to the list of Vegas Yelpers gone wrong.  I understand that Las Vegas isn't exactly a foodie destination (outside of several restaurants on and around the strip).  Thai Style Noodle House is no exception.  My party had the following: Mongolian beef, beef and broccoli, spicy string beans and pork, crispy noodles with seafood gravy.  Sweet, sweet, sweet, with a bit of MSG.  White seats with faux (?) leather all look dirty and our table top was sticky.

One star for the price as this is considered to be cheap Asian food.  

My advice: Head over to Nattaya's Secret Kitchen across the street.  You'll pay more but you'll get much better food."}
{"text":"Awesome service!
Went here for a friend's bday and I had a good experience. We were a group of ten and we came around 7-8ish for dinner. Their staff is so accommodating and polite. Our servers always made sure our drinks were topped off and they constantly checked up on us to see how we were doing. The food was really good too!"}
{"text":"Only reason they aren't getting 5 stars is because of the size and decor of the dining room. This is the very definition of \"hole in the wall\" authentic restaurant. Some of the best thai food you will ever eat, but be willing to wait for it. They only have like 5 tables and the place is always packed."}
{"text":"We couldn't figure out what to eat driving down spring mountain.  With 9 of us walking into an empty restaurant, we were expecting disappointment.  The restaurant started to fill up slowly.  Only problem was there was only 1 server, and two kitchen people.  The food took awhile to come out...one dish at a time.  But it was worth the wait.  We loved all of our dishes, great portions (can easily serve 2), and great price!  Their tom yum soup, flat noodles, pad thai, fried chicken with fried rice, and duc noodle soup was my favorite!"}
{"text":"\"What do you want to eat?\" Was one of the first thing I heard when I woke up. After eating buffets, hot dogs,burgers all day in Las Vegas I was craving Thai food. Authentic Thai food. So we found this gem.  We had three dishes and I have to say I was well satisfied. The place was a typical hole in the wall but I knew it was authentic since I saw the stack of thai newspaper when I walked in.  We had the boat noodle, chicken basil leaves, and last but not least the combo. Which consist of grill pork, papaya salad, and sticky rice.  Inexpensive and authentic.  I'll definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"Service really Really not good!It is unfriendly. Female employee receiving delivery order"}
{"text":"Phenomenal Thai-style take-out place. Took less than 10 minutes between placing the order and leaving the restaurant; amazing speed and service for the quality of the food. Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Green Curry, and Tom Kha Soup are a few of our favorites from Thai Style Noodle House."}
{"text":"Absolutely best Thai food on Vegas! Great menu reasonable prices. Staff friendly, happy and attentive. This is a great place to have dinner. Will be back often"}
{"text":"Vegan review:

Read that they had a Vegan/vegetarian menu and decided to try it out. Arrived just past noon on a Saturday and there were a few tables open. We were seated immediately, and I asked for the Vegan/Vegetarian menu. After much deliberation, I ordered the Veggie potstickers and the Pad See Eu with mixed tofu and veggies.

Veggie potstickers: When ordering, I confirmed with the waiter that these were vegan without dairy and egg products. He assured me they were. When they arrived, they had a creamy sauce on it, so I asked him what it was. He said it was mayo (which I already assumed) and I proceeded to tell him that mayo is NOT vegan. He said he didn't know that, which was alarming to me, because how can you advertise a vegan menu without knowing what things are/are not vegan? He took back the potstickers and brought back another order without the mayo. He assured me that the potstickers themselves were vegan. I ate one carefully and it was okay. Nothing to call home about. 

Pad See Eu (veggie) with tofu and mixed veggies: really flavorful and filling. The portion size was huge and I got lots of big chunks of tofu. I am very pleased with how this dish came out. It was only $6.95, too! Totally worth it. 

Overall, I would come again for the main dishes but not the apps. The potstickers were just okay and I'm disappointed that they were not actually vegan and that the waiter didn't know that they weren't. I'm giving 4 stars because of the potsticker mishap. You can't beat the prices though!"}
{"text":"From reading the low reviews from this place and people complaining about the decor I'm wondering what that has to do with food?

Although I'm not Thai, I grew up in Thailand for 15 years. I think people eating here need to remember that this place is called noodle house. That's means they're known for their noodles. This place is the closest I can get to actual Thai street noodles. Although the service could be better, I don't go to a restaurant based on what it looks like or based on the service. I go based on the food and this place hits the mark for me. One of my favorite places to go for Thai noodle soups. 

On another note, Thai noodle soups are also very hard to find here in the US. You can find pho anywhere but, for some reason it's hard to find a decent bowl of Thai noodles. Like I said before, this place gets as close as I can get to the actual thing."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant when I want some cheap eats. I like to get the pad see eu, Thai noodle soup, and large Thai iced coffee. The staff is always attentive and they keep my water glass filled. Dinner for two falls easily under $20 before tip."}
{"text":"This place is my go to Thai Restaurant in Blue Diamond !!!! They have the finest noodles at an affordable price and their customer service is on point. The restaurant itself is super clean, stylish and built with t.v. entertainment. 

Great food-- will definitely be a regular here. :)"}
{"text":"Hard to believe this place is right down the  strip from treasure island. Great Thai food and really cheap prices.Be prepared to wait around lunch or dinner times as the place is small. Must try.."}
{"text":"Not impressed with with place at all. Based off of the 4 stars, maybe I ordered the wrong dish....The waterfall beef. The beef was so dry, tough, and extremely bland. Couldn't really tell I was eating beef because it literally had no taste. The sauce was very odd also. Pretty gross. I'll stick with Le Thai downtown."}
{"text":"Six months ago, i gave this place wonderful review, but now everything has changed.  Don't get me wrong the tom yum noodle is good but the service has gone down.  I traveled all the way to Las Vegas from Ca to eat here and it has greatly disappointed my bf and me.  We ordered the Tom yum noodle soup and the sweet sticky rice with mango.  When I tried the sweet sticky rice, it was so freaken hard to chew and swallow (Trust me, I have ordered sweet sticky rice from plenty of place).  My bf also tried it and agreed that he has never ate sweet sticky rice this hard.  It tasted like raw uncooked rice where it is so darn hard and don't even think about chewing it.  You have to swallowed it whole. That was not it!  When i told my waiter about how the sweet sticky rice was so hard, she gave me an attitude and snapped at me with \"YES IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE HARD\".   i was baffled by her rudeness! WTH?  I am not THAI but i have had sweet sticky rice too many time to know that is suppose to be chewable and consumable and soft.  OMG.  I was very disappointed in both the food quality and service.  So rude.  I would not recommend any one to dine here."}
{"text":"Ordered to go through a good deliver site. This place is really good and has great prices. We got yellow curry and Pad Ped Snapper. Unfortunately the curry portion is a little small but both meals tasted amazing. We'll be ordering from here again for sure"}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai spot. Everything I had here was amazing.
Found this place through Yelp. (Of course.)
Came here for Saturday dinner at 8 pm. It was not that busy so there was no wait to be seated in this nice comfortable booth.
There were two waitresses working that night and they both waited on us. They were both very nice and attentive.
Their chicken satay had very strong curry flavor but not spicy. I loved it. The peanuts sauce was not just sweet but it had a little spicy taste because the sauce was in some kind of spicy oil. It was good.
Seafood Wonton soup was nice and flavorful. Came with a lot of rice noodles. It's nice  you can pick noodles from four different kinds. 
I ordered my red curry spice level 7. A bit spicier than regular spicy curry. Usually, they never get it right. I often have to send my curry back to put more spice in. Wow. They got it right. It was the perfect spice level 7 taste. I enjoyed my curry very much. Chicken was tender. Lots of veggies in it. 
I saw two Thai customers eating at this place. (I saw them speaking in Thai with the waitresses.) I figure that means the food here is authentic. I don't think I ever saw Tai people eating at other Thai places. Usually I see a lot of Indian people at Thai restaurants lately. 
This place definitely is my new fave. Good dessert shop is right next door after the meal!! I liked it here better than Archi's."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for cheap and fast Thai food!!!! My go to dishes are papaya salad, larb, chicken panang and an order of sticky rice. Their sticky rice is always a hit or miss. Food always comes out quick. Servers are quick and attentive. It's a small place so I always avoid going during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"We love this place. This is my families go to place for thai food. Customer service is ok. Pad thai. Pad seeu, fried chicken over fried rice, and crispy noodle seafood combination is what we always order. We just recently moved to las vegas and weve eaten here almost every week!"}
{"text":"3.5 to 4 stars. but I'm going to opt for a 3 star rating because yelp still hasn't let us give .5 ratings! so stupid. but anyways. the service was good. the food was good (not great). the prices were so so. for a hole in the wall place i'd expect each dish to be 6.5-8.5 dollars but they were actually all about 8-9.50. we had the calamari for an ap which i believe was 6.50 but worth every penny. the panang salmon was okay, avacodos and curry... interesting but it was okay. Ginger snapper was just okay as well... we wanted it deep fried but it didn't come out deep fried even though they said it was. 

Lets put it like this, it wasn't good enough for me to stop searching around vegas for the ultimate thai spot."}
{"text":"Excellent food and always welcoming of ingredients changed to your order. The Tom Ka coconut soup is outrageous. I can't say how much better this Thai restaurant is compared to others, that all depends on personal preferences, but I can say this place gets the highest score possible from me because of their amazing menu, great chef, and excellent options when I order delivery. Now that the Rampart construction is finished I can get to Thai Noodle House in a hop, skip, and a jump. You have just got to go and try it for yourself! You wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am very picky with Pad Thai. Many places don't do it well. This place had amazing Pad Thai and did it correctly! Friendly staff with great Chicken Pad Thai! I highly recommend it to anyone! I don't usually eat other food from Thai Restaurants but tried a couple of other things and was pleasantly surprised. Try it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED! I drop by for quick lunch with wifey before picking up the kids from school, but ended up with only me had lunch while she watched and her food never came out. And when she asked the waitress she gives bad attitude saying food coming and different chef for different dishes. I've ordered level 6 spiciness for stir fried noodle, but it came out zero spicy level. It took me 15 mins to finish, and wife noodle soup never came out. We just asked for our check plus they over charged me. And once again more excuses for never deliver wife's noodle soup. So only me had lunch. TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE!!! I only give 1 star otherwise it won't post."}
{"text":"Nicest staff ever! Bright my two daughters and wife he and they were very accommodating. The food was amazing and unique. Definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"Price is great for a Thai restaurant and the employees are nice. My husband got the pad Thai and it was on point for him. I'm Thai so I'm pretty critical when it comes to Thai food. There are many choices which is great and always a good sign that the food is authentic. They have take out and we didn't wait long at all for our food which is another plus. Good small spot to have Thai food if you're in town."}
{"text":"Just meh....maybe dine in is better, but the take out was our first and last time ordering."}
{"text":"Great food. Ordered the rad na and the fried calamari and will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Amazing thai food!! The place was a little hard to find. It's a really big plaza and going by the address numbers don't help much. It'll be on the side facing Wynn. 

Once we found the place we weren't exactly too sure if we were in the right place because all it said was noodle house but once we got inside the full restaurant name was painted on the left with a cool mural as well. The mural looked like a hole in the wall, which is exactly what the restaurant is. We were seated very quickly and you can easily tell how busy they were.

On to the food, my boyfriend and I ordered the pad see ew, bbq over fried rice and the Tom yum soup with the think noodles. Sorry no pictures cause we ate it too quickly! The food came out very quick considering a huge family was still waiting for theirs. A little bit of background, my boyfriend is thai and his mom is also a retired Thai chef and we've visited Thailand together twice. So trust that we know good Thai food, and trust that the food here is amazing. The pad see ew tasted just like how his mom makes it. Savory but sweet and with a large portion as well. The bbq chicken over fried rice was my favorite though. The fried rice was really yummy and the bbq chicken came with a sweet and sour sauce that you can dip it in. The Tom yum soup was an okay dish to me, Thai people love their lemongrass and it was a little bit too much for me. We got a level 8 spicy but if you're not used to Thai spicy the level 5 is spicy for Americans. Don't test yourself or try to act cool and get 10... You'll die so don't think about it. The waitresses were very nice and no matter how busy they were they took their time with each customer and checked to see if there was anything else needed. They never rush you to get out but it's courteous not to stay long after your meal so that the waiting customers can grab a seat to eat.

The Overall, very big delicious portions and this will definitely be our Thai spot whenever we visit Las Vegas and make sure to stop by every time too!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for dinner and luckily we came early and beat the dinner rush. 

We were seated right away, since we had a large group we ordered about 6 dishes to share.  We had the papaya salad, fried chicken wings, Thai chicken curry, Thai basil fried rice, veggie tofu dish, and fried chicken over fried rice. 

Prices are super reasonable, about $7 each dish and portions are generous.

Food came out in about 10 minutes and I was very impressed by how tasty all the dishes were. I ordered the papaya salad extra spicy and it was pretty spicy which I loved.. This dish is a must order because it provides some freshness for an otherwise heavy meal. 

I was able to sample all of my friends dishes ( because sharing is caring ), and my faves were the Thai Basil fried rice they did not skimp on the basil, and the fried chicken over fried rice
 Omfg this fried chicken was freaking fantastic, I have no idea what was in it that made it so damn good. It was super crispy and tasty. My friends and I all fought over this dish. BTW this dish did take twice as long to make but its so good its worth waiting !!! 

Cheap and delicious eats ! Especially if you don't feel like eating at the rest of those overpriced strip restaurants"}
{"text":"Due to special circumstances, decided to try Thai Style Noodle House for Father's Day lunch as opposed to a more formal lunch/brunch option.

Wound up to be an excellent choice - service was very nice from several of the restaurant staff, and quality of food was very good - enjoyed the pork larb (a little different than what I usually see it prepared, but good nonetheless), bowl of BBQ pork egg noodle soup, Panang and Pad Thai - all was very good quality.

Restaurant was small and had to wait a few minutes to get a table, but was clean and staff was friendly - definitely a very good option for solid and honest thai food with some chinese style soup options."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food I've had, hands down. I always get it to go, I haven't dined in the restaurant before. I get the Basil Beef and the Chicken Pad See Ew with the Veggie Egg Rolls. I'm a giant baby when it comes to the spicy levels so I always get a 3 and that is usually more than enough spicy for me. The portions are large. The above order is more than enough for my boyfriend and I. The people working are always extremely friendly and it never takes more than 15 minutes to make our entire order. I've never had to wait for anything when I've gone there. 

I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"This is just FYI....they are closed for renovations until 11/19/11. I was so looking forward to trying their food after reading all the good things on yelp. But, I expect they will be better when they re-open all pretty and new!"}
{"text":"We completely stumbled on this place by accident. My man and I had 30 minutes to kill before catching \"I love you, you're perfect, now change\" at the Las Vegas Little Theater (fabulous -- check out my review!) and were disappointed to find that Hawaiian Poke was closed at 7pm. Thai Style Noodle House was the first place open in the chain of restaurants on this little piece of Wynn road, and we decided to check it out. When we opened the door, I was surprised to see how many people were dining. First, this place is an absolute hole in the wall... a clean hole in the wall, as certified by the Las Vegas Dept. of Health (love it when I see the \"A\"!). But, who cares?? The food is absolutely 5 stars! We had the Papaya Salad (loved it..though it was certainly not the star of the meal); Poh-Thack with Seafood (a Thai version of hot and sour soup -- I absolutely could not stop eating the soup... heaven in a bowl); and the Penang Avocado (who would think to put avocado in Penang curry?? love it!!) If the food is one of this venue's main stars, the other one goes to the server. When we explained that we had 30 minutes to nosh, she was incredibly accommodating so that we were able to leave with 5 minutes to spare... this, despite being the only server in this crowded little resto! I am so glad I found Thai Style and cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Normally, I'm a civil person. I am not one to complain because I've been a loyal customer for a couple of years now and I go about 5 times a month with a group of friends each time. But from this day forth, I no longer want to go. 

I ordered this combination of papaya salad with sticky rice and fried pork on the side. When I received this, I noticed many tiny bugs all around it. And because, like I've said I'm a civil person, I did not make much noise and said it quietly to the waiters (might I add THE WORST customer service Ever) pointing towards the plate which as they also noticed and hurriedly took the plate away. As I wait for another 10 minutes for this plate to return we expected them to treat us with nice service considering they could have been sued for this. My friend asked if she could at LEAST considering what happened and asked for a refill of her thai tea and the waiter gives her the dirtiest look and says \"we dont give refills\". Basically, in the end we asked for our check and calculated the total cost and noticed there was NO changes made in our bill. We were given the full price. Never have I been more disappointed.
But this is not the only incident that has happened to me at this location. The last time I went there were lipstick stains on my cup which I had not worn any lipstick at the time clearly stating that i definitely did not take a sip out of the cup nor did they wash the cup. but I've let that go. Until this incident. 
The most inexpensive thai restaurant but now I see you get what you pay for. 
The less you pay, the less the quality PLUS a bonus of insects. ;)
Good luck to those who try this place out in the near future. 
They were lucky it weren't someone else who would've said it out loud reacting harshly towards a situation like this."}
{"text":"Great food and prices. 

Willing to accommodate my vegan diet. 

Great service and portions are very generous. 

On the spice level, five is too hot. Stay at number three.

Added bonus if you belong to the American Airlines advantage dining program. You get miles for your dollars spent here. 

Will definitely come back and recommend."}
{"text":"Cheap eats just minutes from the strip. :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Pot stickers, duck noodle soup, red curry combination, cold noodle salad, fried shrimp, duck wide noodles with house sauce. Level 1-10 we got eight which made me sweat, it was awesome. It's in china town about 12$ cab from the strip. I will go back. Delicious."}
{"text":"This review just solid on the food I ordered. The food is good. Ordered 3 companion. Sticky rice was undercooked. But the pork and papaya salad goes with it so yummy. Also I like their tomyum soup as well. Flavorful. Big bowl with noodles. Service was ok."}
{"text":"They tomyum noodle soup is to die for. I like it so much. Noodles amount a little too little for me but it's ok cause price was reasonable. Add extra noodle if you want a good amount of noodle in it. Service was ok. food is good!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the prices unbelievable, and the service was quick and friendly.   The atmosphere is laid back and beautiful. We had 2 appetizers, 4 entrees, 3 drinks and a dessert for $51!  And every single thing was delicious.   The potstickers were yummy.  We're already talking about when we're going back. 

Give this place a shot.  Your taste buds and your wallet will thank you."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying the Thai Style Noodle House on Jones and Warm Springs. You can find Thai Style Noodle House on the southwest corner and right behind the Lucky's Lounge. 

We saw the good reviews on Yelp! and decided to give it a shot.

Wow! What a gem!

Things I like-

- Ordered the Tom Yum soup with vermicelli noodles ($6.95), the chicken pad see ew($6.95), and the BBQ chicken fried rice (also $6.95) Portions were very healthy for the price point and everything tasted so yummy!
- the chicken pad see ew almost had a subtle sweetness to its flavoring that made the dish very tasty! Not overpowering, but still noticeable ...it was just right! :)
- the chicken fried rice was very tasty and the rice was soft and fluffy!
- the tom yum was served in a HUGE bowl and this was the first time I've had it served to me in town with the vermicelli noodles. So tasty and full of flavor!
- service was friendly and competent. 
- the actual restaurant itself is very spacious and is tastefully decorated. Lots of purple and pink!

Things I did not like-

- the soft drinks, once again, served in a can ($1.50 each). Argh! 

Aside from the whole soda in a can thing, I love this place and will definitely be back on numerous occasions! Great food, in healthy portions, at a reasonable price! This place is somewhere you definitely want to make a point to check out if you appreciate some good Thai food!

4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place was an unexpected gem and recommended especially for those who live in the area.  We had the Guay-Teaiw-Loard, seafood aoup, and pad Thai along with fried banana for dessert.  The portions were fairly big and the food overall was quite tasty.  For a chill atmosphere and family-sized portions, check this place out."}
{"text":"First time trying here and it was a good experience. The portions and price are fair and the food tastes good ! I'm not really sure why everyone is having such a bad experience at this location as the server was very nice and attentive towards us. The only thing was that the Spicy Level wasn't consistent with both dishes. Other then that I'd recommend this place"}
{"text":"First time for everything.  Interior is pretty nice, for a grocery store shopping center location, its on the corner of Lake Mead and Rampart, but the big Smiths Shopping store, opposite end from the grocery store.   Its on the NW corner.   It was slightly tricky to find.   I asked the 'owner' I assume for her favorite thai soup, she recommended her version of the tom yum, I got it with extra fish balls and spice level 5, since my gut is killing me lately, but I was fine after I slurped this yummy goodness down.  The fishballs tasted and had the texture of scallops, I was amazed, that was a surprise. the rice noodles inside a tom yum broth with some chilis and chili oil flowing over the abiss of broth, fish balls(ASK FOR THIS!) and little bits of meat and shrimps.  My buddy had the Chix Noodle Soup and he said it was the best he has ever had.  I had to ding em up on the service.  Its seat yourself and the girl running the place, seemed very stressed out.   She was there with I needed her, barely, we had to get our own napkins once we slammed are faces into the goodness, but that's elementary for a restaurant, bring me a napkin.  Also, my buddy asked for rice and meat and she had no recommendation, she was silent, maybe it was a language barrier.  A host or something would have helped the whole service standard.  Still, the place has a great atmosphere, they are pretty fast too, and the food is different and very tasty compared to the 100+ thai places I have been too, I will go back again and again....Phob gun Reaw-reaw nee khrup ---translation --See You soon!"}
{"text":"Used to be my goto place, well not anymore. Everything is wrong. Whatever we ordered today came out wrong. We order no bok choy, there's bok choy in my order. Order glass noodle got vermicelli. Waitress has a bad attitude on top of it. NO MORE! VERY DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"Pad thai is yummy! Also obsessed with the pineapple fried rice and the pineapple curry with shrimp! Always a go to when I'm looking for something super yummy and quick or  a last minute carry out order"}
{"text":"First time here and definitely will be coming back! Good variety of dishes on the menu and for reasonable prices. We ordered yellow curry, duck fried rice, crab Rangoon and pad Thai and they were all delicious. Glad to find a Thai place close by that isn't overpriced."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and it's definitely a decent spot to eat if you're coming in and out. The service was fast and they check on you a lot. I ordered a noodle soup. It was soy base with vegetables, chicken and seafood. My kind of style in food. I also ordered the pot stickers. Loved the presentation; they had a sauce drizzled on top. Noodle bowl which was large and pot stickers (6 count) was $15."}
{"text":"Try the potstickers!!!  

The spot is kind of hidden and feels like you're heading down a dark alley when you try to get to it but the food is superb.  Plus its cheap!!

Great place to try for Thai Food.. if you can find it... lol."}
{"text":"I had the WORST Larb salad ever at this restaurant it smelled like cat food and the meat was grey"}
{"text":"The interior was nice and clean. I ordered some Papya salad and sticky rice, along with beef combination noodle soup. Everything was delicious! I wish that our server came back more often to offer to fill our drinks, but it was pretty busy. Everyone was friendly and the price was great! Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat right now. Always get the same thing and im always happy. Only complaint is i wish they had a location closer to alliante area."}
{"text":"At 6:30pm, I decided to try this place out since it was just a couple of doors down from the phone repair shop where my daughter was having her iPhone repaired. The place was empty which said plenty to me, but the menu looked alright. The restaurant was extremely sterile and clean. We chose a booth and sat down. When I told the lady we needed a few more moments to order our food, she continued to stand at the table so I felt slightly rushed. I ordered a sliced beef noodle soup with wide rice noodles, a pad see ew, and a basil chicken and rice to split with my daugher. She also ordered a thai tea. I asked to keep a menu so that I could order a to-go item to take home and the server actually told me he needed it back so that was that. The tea came up right away and my daughter commented that it mostly tasted like milk and sugar. The beef noodle soup came up next and was no more than mediocre. The beef sliced seemed rubbery and lacked flavor. The basil chicken was alright, but it the vegetables were extremely undercooked...more like slightly warmed up, but still raw. The noodles in the pad see ew were all stuck together so I packed it up and hope my boyfriend will eat it, or maybe the dogs. Needless to say I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Pad thai is delicious, fried rice with shrimp is awesome and the mango sticky rice is on point. Price is great and you get pretty big portions, the pad thai can be shared between two. Thai tea is also great! This is one of my favorite places in china town."}
{"text":"The last two times my order to go has taken way too long. 30 minutes and just today 40 minutes. I saw people that ordered after me get theirs first. And tonight one of their excuses was \"they called before you came.\" Well I would've called also if you actually answered your phone during the 10 minutes I was trying to reach someone. After 40 minutes I asked for a refund so I could leave and get food somewhere else. The lady went to the kitchen instead of giving me my refund and oh my food just happened to be ready. 
Neither of those times was the place even halfway full. 
If you're debating on where to go for Thai food go somewhere else."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places in Vegas, especially if I am looking for authentic soup. The location is tiny, and easy to miss if you are not looking for it. No special décor, no dress code. Just real Thai food at it's finest, served by people who know what they are doing. 
For appetizers, I love the chicken satay, crab rangoons, and their special style of pot sticker, that is not like your classic gyoza at all. They offer Tom Kha, or Tom Yum, with or without noodle, and you also get to choose between 4 types of noodle. Also, they will totally accommodate special requests. I ordered regular chicken noodle soup, and they made it Thai spicy per my request. 
My daughter loves the pineapple fried rice, and gets it every single time we go here. Its a mix of shrimp and chicken, and is not spicy like other dishes.
Level 8 is my go to. It's almost unbearable, but still has tons of flavor. 
My boyfriend loves the garlic and pepper entrée with chicken, and a fried egg. 
You can get this as a lunch special as well, smaller portion but at a great price! He gets a level 5 or 6, and its just a tad spicy. Average, if you can't handle it, you shouldn't be eating Thai food! 
The curry is also a safe bet, I prefer yellow or panang. Pretty large portions with the dinner, I had to ask for extra rice. 
I have never once dined here and not been totally satisfied with my meal, the service, the pricing, and my overall experience. I eventually will step out of my normal routine and try something new!"}
{"text":"Ever since I was introduced to this place, I eat here every time I am in Vegas, this place is a must! After a night of drinking/partying, rather than eating pho, this place makes the best noodles. I don't normally eat the same thing each time. They allow you to choose the broth, and type of noodle you prefer. Their pineapple fried rice and their pad thai is good as well as their tom yum soup. My mouth is watering thinking of it right now! Their thai tea is superb! They have two sizes, order the large, you'll want more. 

They were a little slow when it comes service, but each time I've frequent here, the restaurant is filled, with normally two workers. However, the wait is worth it! 

It's sad to say that there aren't any restaurants like it here in San Jose, CA. So sad! I just want some Thai noodles! If anyone knows of a place similar to the San Jose area, please let me know!"}
{"text":"Nice find in Vegas!  First of all, the price was very reasonable.  It's a small neighborhood restaurant but the food is good.  Thai dishes for less than $7 is a bargain when we're used to paying more for similar dishes in San Francisco.  The chicken larb we tried is one of the best we've had anywhere.  Their crab fried rice had a real fresh crab taste.  Beware of the spicy level they ask for the food on a 1-10 scale with 10 being the hottest.  We wanted 8 on all our dishes we ordered and it was a little too hot even though we are accustomed to spicy food."}
{"text":"I ordered take out via yelp. Once I ordered I called to confirm the estimated pick up time. She told me 25 minutes. I arrived to pick up my order and she said 1 more minute. I waited and waited 10 mins went by and my order still wasn't ready. There weren't very busy about 7 customers dining in. Every time I tried to get her attention to ask about the order she would go to the back. 10 more minutes pass and my order was finally ready. She handed me the food and quickly turned to walk to the register to help a guest leaving. No apology or anything. The pork belly was burnt and cold by the time we got to attempt to enjoy our food. The fried chicken had no meat on it because it seemed to be over fried. We also order Chow Mein and that was okay. Only food worth 5 stars was the N.H. Style Pot Stickers. Everything else service, food and wait time I'd rate a 1 star."}
{"text":"I love the Lad Na here so much that I had it twice in one day.  Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Disappointment is an understatement for how I feel about this establishment. My pad thai had absolutely no flavor other than sugar sweetness, the worst part was how the rice noodles were just plain soggy. Ugh let's put it this way, it's was hard to swallow! 
I also ordered papaya salad heat level 8 and they barely made it a 1, they handed me sambel olek to make spicier! Rude right? We all know you need to use Thai chili peppers and remix the salad to give it that fire spicy kick. 
What the heck, they swear I've never had som tum before! I guess they just don't really care about the quality of their food or customers request; super frustrating. I don't ever see myself giving them another try."}
{"text":"This place is filthy!  The windows are disgusting!   YUK!!   WASH YOUR WINDOWS INSIDE AND OUT, THAI STYLE!!  WIPE OFF YOUR FILTHY MENUS - THERE ARE FOOD DROPPINGS INSIDE.  YUK!  WIPE OFF YOUR CHAIRS - THERE ARE FOOD DROPPINGS ALL OVER THE CHAIRS.  What is your kitchen like if you are this filthy in the eating area?  Unfortunately, dirty Thai/Asian restaurants like this give ALL Asian restaurants a bad name.

Old rice is served, too.  My husband ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken and there was no chicken, just batter on skin.  Ewww.  Very disappointed, we used to love this place.  Either they need a new manager, or they will go out of business.  Waiters are not friendly, either.  

PLUS, the bathroom is located out in the back alley!!  You have to go outside, like at an old fashioned gas station.  How do the employee's wash their hands?????

YUK!!  This place needs sanitizing!!  The Health Department needs to visit this place and issue some citations."}
{"text":"Not bad for the price. Had the pad Thai and chicken skewers. Pad Thai was pretty good but skewers a little on the dry side. Very fast service."}
{"text":"Food is always to satisfaction, better throughout the week than on weekends. I CRAVE their soups!!! A must try, at least once."}
{"text":"Yummy and deliciously spicy!!! We order tum yum soup (chicken), papaya salad and Thai beef ball noodle soup all were soooooooo gooood!!! Would recommend to anyone who loves spice and flavors. Service was quick and meal prep was fast. Reasonable price."}
{"text":"I asked for spicy orange chicken and they gave me fried chicken with pepper flakes on it.... very disappointed and won't be back. Plus the person taking my order didn't even understand what I was saying."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have an extensive vegan menu (you have to ask for it), and the items are so delicious and cheap. I get the eggplant with fried tofu, and the Thai spicy noodle with fried tofu. Both are so delicious, and the total comes out to $15. The service is good also. I just wish they had a dairy alternative so I could enjoy a boba tea with my food."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years,just letting you know they have a lunch menu they dont give out unless you ask since its such a steal.your welcome"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. I got the cashew chicken and the coconut soup. I could not eat the soup it was so salty. They made no effort to correct it. The cashew chicken has so much pineapple and corn that I maybe had half of an edible meal."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food but it was so quiet that it ruined my time eating. The waiter and waitress were rude but I could have came in on a bad day. It made the atmosphere feel weird and awkward."}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai food off the strip!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at  just about every thai place in town literally  and this is my favorite, the prices are awesome the portions are very generous and most importantly the food is amazing. Not a single bad experience here. I eat here about twice a week. Wish i can give 6/5 stars"}
{"text":"I have never felt inclined to leave a review on Yelp until now. Now I must admit that I wasn't expecting too much, but Yelp's good reviews and my family's overwhelming hunger led me here. I found this to be an extremely well done example of relatively cheap but delicious Thai restaurant. I ordered Pineapple fried rice with chicken, which was absolutely delicious. The chicken and egg were a perfect combination with the fried rice and the pineapple added to the overall flavor. We also ordered Red curry, Spicy Eggplant Rice plate, and Pad See-eu, all of which were absolutely delicious. At the end we had Mango Sweet Sticky Rice which tasted like Kheer, an Indian sweet rice pudding, with mangoes, but had its own unique texture giving it a brilliant taste."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in Vegas. We ordered chicken pad Thai potstickers and chicken chow Meir was great authentic Thai. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Another great hole in the wall....  We tried a bunch of dishes,  Pad Thai, Crab Fried Rice, Duck Noodles, Vegetarian Spring Rolls, & they were all good.  Even the Thai Iced Tea met my standards.  Glad we decided to try this restaurant.  They seemed to be understaffed, but service was competent."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love that it is so very close to where I stay. The food is great and the restaurant itself is really quite charming in decor. Very rarely do I find an affordable place with more then half a dozen items on the menu that I would consider superb. From the coconut chicken soup to the pad thai and beef noodle classics to their signature and quite possibly my favorite dish here, the pad ped  snapper. Seriously, for under ten dollars you can get a warm, delicious thai delicacy, served quickly, with a smile. This place is perfect to meet up at for a quick lunch or to order take-out on the way home. Especially now that the weather is getting cooler again, I'm for sure looking forward to taking home some of their amazing soups and comforting stews."}
{"text":"What a fantastic find - thanks Yelpers. Our family of 4 ate here and ordered 5 dishes for about $50. The Pad Thai and Tom Yum soup were the highlights but everyone enjoyed their food. The place is a bit small and on the side of the building, kind of tough to navigate from the parking. If I had someone close to where I lived that had this high of quality of food and reasonable prices I would be here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Yelpers let me down tonight . Thought this place would be a shorter wait and better food than Archis based on reviews but it was not . Lotus of Siam still #1 for Thai in Las Vegas IMO . 

It's a little hole in the wall spot but no gem. The food wasn't that flavorful but it was priced cheap so I guess you get what you pay for . 

We also did notice that everyone else's (Asians) plates of fried rice were fuller and were garnished nicely with cilantro and cucumber whereas ours came without SO I made sure to ask the waitress for it . Also they don't ask you what spice level you want - just have spice on the table for you to add .

Service wasn't that great, food was forgettable, and we won't be back . 

We had : 

Veggie rolls - were good . 

Crab fried rice - crab was overcooked and had fishy taste to it :(

Chicken fried rice - mediocre .

Chicken"}
{"text":"We liked it. It definitely does not deserve a 4 or more, though.

The inside is nice, clean, and modern. We weren't expecting that, especially after we saw the prices. Dishes were mainly around $7.95-8.95, which we thought were more along the lines of fast food prices. The portions, however, were remarkably small. You get what you pay for I guess.

We started off with a papaya salad, at a spicy 8/10. For some reason the portion we got was very very little, compared to some yelp pictures I checked online. Even the cabbage was just a small hunk, but when I asked for more, they were very accommodating.

We got some sort of veggie stir fry flat noodle, which was good, but could've been better. The vegetables in it weren't great, the carrots were sliced too thin, and the portion was again, too small.

The last thing we got was our least favorite. It was a seafood pancake, which I expected to be kind of like the ones you get a Korean restaurants, so I was curious about the Thai version. It was seriously lacking in the seafood, way too much starch or whatever they mixed it with so as a result kind of bland, and FAR too oily. I don't rarely blot food with napkins, but I did so in this situation. Also not a fan of the bed of stir-fry bean sprouts it came on, I think raw would've been more authentic? Just my two cents.

All in all, we really wanted to like it, we kind of liked it, and we hope that in the future they give bigger portions. We both agreed we could've gotten a fourth dish, which shouldn't be the case with any restaurant to feel full unless it's tapas."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food here. We had papaya salad, basil fries rice and fresh garlic tofu. Kids had chicken satay and chicken noodle soup. All were happy. Already planning our next visit. Oh - service was great as well.

Went there a second time (same LV trip) and they messed up some of my order. The kids dish came out spicy and the tofu in ours was fried when we didnt ask for it. To be fair we weren't explicit about it but then we werent asked either. Still going with 5 stars as the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I really am a Lotus of Siam devotee, but this is food, not religion, so we're allowed open relationships.  If Lotus is my classier and more diverse wife, Thai Style Noodle House is my down-to-Earth and no BS mistress.  There are times when I just want to be taken care of, I don't want frills, just delicious, authentic, straight-up Thai goodness.  Those are the times I go to Thai Style.  She's all content, inexpensive, gives more than receives, and I love her.

Everyone loves the noodle soup for a good reason, it's probably the best and cheapest you'll get in Vegas.  But don't forget to try other things, like the ginger snapper or the duck pad kee mao, both yummy!  The squid salad is not as good as Lotus, but it's half the price so there you go.  I'm sure there are things Lotus doesn't do as well as Thai Style.  Oh, am I defending my mistress over my wife?  I'm sorry, sometimes I can't control myself.

Well, there's another thing with my mistress.  She surprises me with how thoughtful she can be.  There's a waitress at Thai Style that has an amazing memory.  I've been there three times, and she already has my preferences tattooed into her memory.  Yep, come on in to Thai Style.  She doesn't have to just be mine."}
{"text":"Love there food here..so yummy and great prices not so expensive..fried ice cream is always a must for me here for dessert so good"}
{"text":"Having read the reviews for Thai Style Noodle House I was really downhearted by the results. I found this location on yelp after some grocery shopping. The picture that are posted will tell the short version of this long tale!

Thai Style Noodle House is small and can only sit a very limited amount of people. This is not the best place for a party greater than 4-6 people. The table are usually set for two people and if a table with 4 shows they will combine a table for you. They only have two racks of hot sauce  holders which you must share with all the table in the restaurant. 

My table of two ordered Chicken Pad Thai, Chu Chee Salmon, and Duck Fried Rice. I also had the Thai Style Ice Tea. 

The place would have received four stars but some error occurred on the waitress side. I placed an order for Thai Style Ice Tea in the beginning when they ask for drinks. She returns with water for my guest and nothing for me. She places our three orders and I start to wait. Once the chicken pad thai and duck fried rice has arrived I informed her about my miss drink. She recalls and bring me the Thai Style Ice Tea. I highly recommend the pad thai because it was delicious and the thai style ice tea. I was a little disappointed in the duck fried rice since it seem to have more pork than duck. We informed the waitress that we have not gotten the Chu Chee Salmon and she informed us it was coming. By the time we finish the pad thai and was almost done with the duck fried rice the Chu Chee Salmon has arrived. I am guess she has forgot about the order until the reminder. As the two star states: \"Meh. I've Experienced better.\""}
{"text":"I eat here for lunch 3 or 4 times a month.  The noodle house Tom Yum soup is my favorite.  A delicious full meal in a bowl.  I have eaten here with friends on several occasions and always come away with positive reviews.  The help is friendly but most of all they take the food very seriously and put out an excellent dish."}
{"text":"I visited Thai Style Noodle House for the first time and have to say I was disappointed.  I asked about the Garlic and Pepper dish and was told by the staff that it was really good.  I ordered it with shrimp to go.  Upon arriving home and unpacking the meal, I found a small portion of five small shrimp and canned mushrooms. I choose Asian foods because I enjoy fresh vegetables in my prepared dishes.  The use of canned veggies screams of low quality and little care in preparation.  My expectation was a fresh prepared meal.  I would have rather had them suggest a more popular dish.  It was nothing even close to authentic.  I giess I should have known by the sign Thai Style.  All I can say is not even close."}
{"text":"WTF!!! Hands down the best thai restaurant here in Vegas! The price for everything was good, food was excellent! Came here with 6 of my friends, ordered about 7 dishes which were all good! I recommend the crab fried rice, panang curry and of course phad thai! You will not be disappointed!! This truly deserves a 5 star! wished they served beer tho;)"}
{"text":"It's cheap, it's tasty, good portion sizing, the service has been great every time we've gone, great variety of dishes, never a wait for a table, they do delivery for $1 within a 3 mile radius.

I'd probably avoid the edamame, won ton noodle soup and green curry is a bit watery.

Chicken Pad Thai, crispy pork with chinese broccoli, thai special fried noodle, tom yum noodle soup all really delicious. 

Would definitely recommend you to go and give it a try!"}
{"text":"One of my fam's favorite Thai restaurants in Vegas. Their food is very authentic and contains awesome flavors. They have several locations as well. Their main one is in the Chinatown area on Spring Mountain.

I looove spicy food so I'm always up for trying places that specialize in spicy dishes. Thai and Laotian foods are known to have a lot of heat, and if you're like me, this place would be a yummy choice!

Pro-tip:
-Some orders may be served in A La Carte portions, so make sure to ask for this if you plan on sharing dishes with a group!

Faves/Recommendations:
-Panang (Curry)
-Tom Yum (Soup)
-Khua Khai (Noodle dish)
-Pad See Ew (Noodle dish)"}
{"text":"Finally some solid thai food near the crib. Rampart and Lake Mead....In my opinion it crushes Jasmine Thai and Pin Kaow in this vicinity. A few more impressive visits will constitute some 5 star action.....UPDATE: 5th STAR earned do to continuous awesome food! The wifey and I have tried multiple dishes on their menu and have been impressed with them! Tom Ka Goong, Tom Yum Goong, Duck noodle soup and Seafood Tom Yum Noodle soup with Rice noodles are a few of our favorites. Great for kids also!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I just moved back to Vegas and I'm in search of a great Thai place. My husband and I stopped in last night (Saturday) at the recommendation of a coworker who lives in the area, and we really enjoyed the food - this is definitely a solid place for a good Thai dinner!

It's a cozy, welcoming place - very modern decor, with two different seating areas - we asked to be on the left side of the restaurant since nobody else was there, which they had no problem with. Someone came over quickly to get our drink order, and we put our dinner order in at the same time since we generally order the same thing every time we have Thai - chicken tom kha soup to share, chicken pad thai (me) and chicken thai fried rice (him) - all at a 6, or 7 if we really feel like punishing ourselves. 

Our food came out quickly. Portions are a perfect size - there was enough tom kha for both of us to have a couple bowls and take home a serving for leftovers - husband finished all of his fried rice, but I had plenty of pad thai leftover. The food was delicious - very fresh and at the perfect spice level! Very flavorful. Their tom kha soup had more of a sweetness than we are used to, but it was so good - a welcome change. 

At the end of our meal, someone else came around to check on us and make sure we liked our dinner and to ask if we needed anything. We didn't ever feel like we were waiting for service here, even as they started to get busier. Last thing to mention - prices are very reasonable. I think our bill was just over $20. I love this place and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"It's gonna be a NO for me!!!! Clearly I missed the rave bandwagon on Thai Style Noodle House (Spring Mountain/Wynn) location. For starters I have been recommended this place plenty of times and finally decided last week to give them a try. Really been craving Thai food these past few weeks so I thought why not?! My co-worker and I took our lunch break together after an appointment with a client and just so happens she loves Thai food as well.

When we walked in, there really wasn't anybody working but the kitchen people. Finally after just guessing to just seat ourselves that's exactly what we did. Maybe 5 minutes later a lady from the back came out and gave us menus. We inquired about them having any kind of lunch specials and was shut down really quick like \"No! No lunch specials here.. we too small for that\" I'm like huh?! okay girl whatever tell us what's good here then... She then said \"Other location have lunch special we don't\" Okay.. we get it no lunch special that's fine so tell us what's good here.. She was clueless I was already starving and this encounter was getting me even more irritated than I already was. Time was being wasted and we had to get back to work. 

Finally we ordered.. Egg rolls... Yellow Shrimp Curry & Shrimp Pad Thai. Entire meal was just like huh is this really what people are raving about? Our first batch of egg rolls came out and they were burnt, sent those back and by the time the new ones came the actual entree's were also ready. My co worker and I both agreed that the shrimp that was in both of our dishes was way too fishy and I just can't eat seafood when it has that particular taste. I eat plenty shrimp and I know it's not suppose to taste like that.. When we brought it to the severs attention she could careless. I didn't make a big deal about it because it just wasn't worth it.. I just won't be back it's that simple.. I hear the other location is better but I'm even questioning wanting to try that one out..."}
{"text":"The service here is non existent. I walked to the back where the \"hostess stand\" was and asked if we seated ourselves, to which the two girls said nothing, then one of the girls grabbed two menus and walked us to a table. We sat for a good 10 minutes without being acknowledged. I called over one of the girls to ask for water and to place my order. I ordered the chicken yellow curry and spicy Thai basil both with brown rice. The yellow curry had a good consistency and came with white meat chicken while the Thai basil came with dark meat which was low quality. Both dishes were minimal in size and came with a big scoop of rice and a small amount of the actual dish. 

The prices here are considerably lower than most Thai restaurants but the quality and value is about the same as an average neighborhood Thai restaurant. They do offer brown rice so I may come back if I am in the neighborhood and want a quick straight forward meal."}
{"text":"I don't know how people eat here. The lady sitting at the back door of the restaurant was smoking a cigarette and I highly doubt she washed her hands before going back to cooking. 

As soon as we walked into the restaurant we were hit with a nauseating smell. It smelled like the restaurant had not been properly cleaned in quite some time and that there was dirty sewage water in close proximity. We walked out and made the executive decision to leave because we thought there was a good chance we may get a food borne illness."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review yet. I've been here probably 20 times. I would have to give their flavor rating maybe a 4.0 or 4.5 on flavor. But the thing that makes me choose 5 stars, is that everything on the menu is good! I think there's only been one order out of many which I didn't care too much for. But it was a new dish to me, and I didn't want to give it negative points on something that I can't fairly judge.

I love the pad thai. The avocado salmon curry is yummy. The panang curry is great. The yellow curry is delicious.

Even my coworkers who aren't very adventurous love this place too. I'm not sure how that worked out, considering that my taste buds tend to be a bit more eclectic."}
{"text":"This is me and my brothers' go-to Thai place, specially since it's so near our house and they're open late (I think 'til 11pm everyday) They have really good food. I haven't had anything from there that I didn't like. I love the combo beef noodle soup and their bbq over rice entree as well as their green curry. I got tofu and the yellow curry with pumpkin and chicken for the boyfriend who is Arab and never had Thai food before and let's just say he couldn't stop raving about it that he had to go get more curry from them the next day :) The staff are very friendly as well, even tho we would always go there late at night. I love that their food is pretty authentic, having experience Chef McDang's (Thailand's only Celebrity Chef) cooking first hand during his demonstration in our school. I'd definitely go there every time I crave for Thai food and would recommend to others :)"}
{"text":"I usually get takeout from this location. The food is really good I usually order the Pad Thai spice level 8 or 9 which they never make it spicy it's usually a level 5 and they even asked me are you sure you wanted that spicy I'm like yes which is not. You could also tell by the color and smell it's not spicy. However the customer service is horrible. I told the lady my noodles won't even spicy and she just threw a thing of chili flakes at me. You would think okay since it's not spicy all we make your dish now you basically just told me to get out by throwing the hot chili flakes."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Food was quickly made and was delicious. We ordered Chicken Satay and Shrimp Rolls for appetizers. We also had Chicken Pad See-eu, Thai Fried Rice, Fried Chicken over Fried Rice and the Three Companion Pork. All were reasonably priced and were good portions. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Clean. Fast and friendly service. The panang avocado with shrimp was delicious!  Will dine here again."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Thai food somewhat near the strip. The prices are very affordable and the portions are huge. I recommend getting their pad thai, pad see ew, and their curries. Their Thai Iced milk tea is very good too.

I've been here two times now with friends who have been to Thailand before, and they have all said that the food is very authentic. Also, be careful when you ask for spicy. Because it will TRULY be spicy. I will definitely be back here again next time I want Thai food in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is one of our \"go-to\" spots for Thai food, and it's centrally located so when the lunch crew is out at various spots we can all meet here. The restaurant itself is not very spacious yet it get packed fairly quickly at lunch time. Thus if you have a rather large group there could be a problem, also if you have small rambunctious rug rats there isn't a whole lot of room and things for them to do. The food has always been excellent. I recommend the chicken noodle soup with thin noodles or the chicken pad thai.

THE MOST ANNOYING thing of this particular restaurant is that they have a Lunch SPECIALS MENU but never say anything and don't tell you about it. They keep it hidden and you have to ask for it every time and when you do they seem upset you asked. It's as if they make commission on lunch sales or something. It make me feel like they would rather have you pay full price for your meal. 


I don't know if they read these reviews, but here's an idea, include your lunch special menu into you main menu, like every other place, it's good advertisement to get your dinner crowds to come in at lunch time."}
{"text":"We order from this place 1-2 times per week and I would eat here more often if 
we could afford it. The food can be somewhat inconsistent 
(maybe because we always order delivery or takeout) but its almost always great. 
I love the pad thai (6), it's one of the best I've ever had, and the orange beef,  
which I don't even think is on the menu, crunchy, sweet, zesty, and delicious, 
remember to ask for alacarte if you want a larger portion.
They remember me almost every time (no beansprouts) lol, and with their large 
customer base that is quite a nice touch. They do however stop answering their
phone if they get busy and stop taking delivery orders if they do answer. So if 
you can't get through and its still during business hours just drive over 
and go inside. The prices are great, it is one of the least 
expensive Thai places we've ever seen. All in all this is our go-to Thai 
place, although there are a few areas they could step it up a bit, the value 
can't be beaten."}
{"text":":( So sad, another disappointing dining experience. My buddy and I were hoping to round out our Vegas trip with some good old fashion Roasted Duck Noodle Soup so we decided to give this place a shot.  

To be fair, service was decent and I'd give the flavor of the soup a letter grade of a \"B\" but what I just couldn't get around was the ROACH that seemed to be lounging in my bowl.  Wow right?  Roast Roach Duck Noodle Soup!  Grossed out and not wanting to eat any longer, we notified the lead server and showed them my little hitchhiker roach and even though they apologized for the incident we decided to leave.  

In retrospect, I'm glad I fished the little roach out before I got more than three spoonfuls of soup down.  The soup is a dark brown broth.  I didn't take the time sift through the rest of my soup but I wouldn't doubt it if there were more little buggers in there."}
{"text":"Second time here in three days.  Soo good and cheap, usually not used in the same sentence.  Each dish is around $7.  All good."}
{"text":"Not very good Thai food. I've had way better. It wasn't very tasty and didn't have any flavor at all. Prices are high too. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is perfect.  I don't understand how you could review this place anything less than 5 stars. It's extremely delicious, the portions are large, and the price is unbelievably cheap. Should be illegal how cheap it is. I often tip extra just because I don't think the price is fair. My favorite thing is basil leaf fried rice and pork jerky."}
{"text":"BEST BROTH EVER! 

Some friends and I tried this place thinking we could order pho soup. But, the menu had similar soups and rice places, but not pho. We still tried their lunch special (soup of the day, side and 1 or 2 food items for $7 or $9 - Great Deal!), and I had the roasted duck soup with rice noodles. You can choose between four noodle styles with the soups. Delicious!

The three of us only paid $17, which was great! Service wasn't the best, but it was the norm for a busy lunchtime. Definitely visiting again!"}
{"text":"I've been getting Thai food from here for a while now. It's fast, inexpensive and the food is amazing! 

Update: WTF happened to this place?! The last few times I've come it's taken over 40 minutes for my food with literally 2 customers inside, I couldn't even call in advance because they don't answer the phone for take out orders. I give up on this place and I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place out since we just recently moved to this side of town. We haven't had Thai food on this side of town and I've been craving some spicy pad Thai noodles! Stumbled upon this little spot all thanks to Yelp! 

We quickly took our seats and our drink orders were ordered almost instantly. The Thai tea was okay, I've had better. I ordered spicy chicken pad Thai. The portion sizes were fairly large. Everything was fresh! My boyfriend ordered the beef soup with rice noodles and he enjoyed every last sip of it. 

Service was quick and the servers were super attentive. Made sure they checked up on us as well as the other customers in the restaurant fairly often. 

As far as cleanliness, they get an A+! If you could guess by now... I'm HUGE on cleanliness. You can tell the owners and workers take the time out to clean each individual booth thoroughly. 

Happy to say that I think I have finally found my \"go-to\" Thai food restaurant!"}
{"text":"Let me take you on a journey:

First stop, chicken wings that were not cooked through. Raw in the middle. The scariest thing was when the guy didn't show surprise, simply muttered a \"sorry\" took the raw wings and disappeared. 

Second stop: Never refilled our drinks once. 

Third stop: They forgot one of our party's order. We had to tell them they completely forgot someone's order, and the response was \"oh\".  Seriously. 

Glad this journey didn't end with a stop into the emergency room."}
{"text":"Went for first time there with my son & his friend yesterday. Food was good. I had beef meatball noodle soup. Halfway through, I found a caterpillar in my soup! I didn't take a picture because I was too shocked. The waiter apologized & brought another bowl. When the check came, I noticed that he still charged me for the soup. A good business man wouldn't charge it but I just shrugged it off. I gave him a $100 bill but he came back & told me the bill is too old. What?! The bill is not old! It was a clean bill, no tear or anything. So I paid with a credit card. With that first impression, I will take my business elsewhere. The food (other than the caterpillar floating in my soup) was good but not that good. My mom (Thai) makes better beef meatball soup, from scratch."}
{"text":"If i could give it 0 stars i would, they suck at customer service and they can seem to understand simple english. On top of that their  food cooks weren't wearing any gloves, or face mask . I found a small facial hair on my food on top of having to pay for food i didn't order since the lady couldn't understand what i wanted. This is the worst customer service and food i ever have experienced."}
{"text":"We were tired yesterday and decided to stop here for dinner. Big mistake, it's the middle of the night and I'm awake.  I know the culprit. MSG!!! Don't eat here if you don't want MSG in your food. The food was boring and bland too. It wasn't even good."}
{"text":"Love the calamari, but the service sucked.  Guy threw the menus down and walked away and we needed more sauce for the cal and I had to go to the front and ask for it.  The Thai tea was great"}
{"text":"Thai is my comfort food... Papaya salad... And Tom yum with shrimp.. (I only eat fish/seafood/tofu)  (a pescetarian).  And the green curry w tofu...This place is hittin.  Delivery will ALWYS get a review from me, so.. Here it is!  Wish they were open later and they DONT have fresh spring rolls... Only fried... Not a plus... Delivery is swift and food hits the spot.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tasty and cheap thai food after a tiring night out? What's not to like! 
Def beats the over price food on the strip. Will be coming here more often when visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"I used to come here often in the past. I really enjoyed the food and the restaurant provided good service. Recently, however, the waitresses are slow, they place orders on the wrong table, and they act unfriendly and unhappy. Instead of greeting people at the door they are too busy talking to each other. The food takes forever to come out.  I won't be coming by anytime soon. Best of luck to this business."}
{"text":"Great service, pad Thai and yellow curry were on point... Only negative... The horrible parking lot. Impossible to get out and make a left onto spring mountain."}
{"text":"Sadly, this place has gone down hill. When they opened the restaurant was bright and stylish. The wall decals are now peeling, the white seats are visibly filthy. The lunch special, which is about the same price as a full size entree, includes a gelatinous egg drop soup. Frankly, it was inedible. You have a choice of appetizer. Egg roll, fried wonton, or fried tofu. Never pick the fried tofu. It's disgusting. My entree was Spicy String Bean with Chicken, which was good, but tiny. It was literally smaller than the scoop of rice included. 

Service is hit or miss; they never seem to answer the phone and they more than happy to make you wait half an hour to refill water or bring your check.. When the restaurant is empty.

If you must go here, get takeout of a full size entree, steering away from the chinese dishes. They are inedible. Try the noodle or curry dishes. The thai soups are also good (not the egg drop.)"}
{"text":"This place is true hidden gem. My friend recommended this place and I am so glad I came. The place is a hole in the wall located in the heart of the China town area.  The place is small and the service can improve. But I will come back again because the food is so delicious and ridiculously cheap in Vegas!!! They make the food fresh on the spot. But you will wait for about 10 mins. All 4 entrees was only $30!!! I recommend the beef combination noodle soup for $6.95. The portion was huge and the soup was very flavorful. The Thai food taste very authentic and very spicy if you don't tell them the level of spiciness! 

I would come back again the next time I'm in Vegas! And the wait time is not bad compared to other local restaurants! Good place to go after a long night from partying.."}
{"text":"I frequent the S. Jones location.  It is by far my favorite Thai spot!  The service is fast and friendly.  The food never disappoints.  We just found out they deliver and that is a huge bonus for me!  The Yellow Curry is ahhh-mazing!  A few other top choices are N.H. Style Pot Stickers and the BBQ Pork and Chinese Sausage Fried Rice!!  Their Pad Thai is another favorite. Their prices are VERY affordable and the establishment is clean."}
{"text":"I was hoping to find a home-away-from-home Thai restaurant in the Summerlin area since my boyfriend lives on that side of town. 

I tried to phone in ahead to have it ready for take out, but they weren't answering the phone. I went in and ordered pad see ew with tofu and felt that the noodles were undercooked, and the sauce wasn't the traditional oyster sauce served with this dish. 
My boyfriend ordered chicken red curry and they gave him tofu by mistake. The worst part was that the lady who took my order read it back to me, and the ticket was correct, but there was an error on that kitchen's part. 

They restaurant was busy so I'm hoping they were just having an off night. The prices are cheaper than most Thai restaurants but I wouldn't come back here if I was craving it and would head to Archi's instead."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place.  I especially like that it is small and no frills, just amazing food and service. I had the BEST broth in Las Vegas for noodle soup here. All of the food was seasoned and made with care.

PROS: Chicken noodle soup
             Broth
             Papaya Salad (medium heat)
             Greens with crispy pork
             PRICES!!!!!
             

They will see me again sooner than later."}
{"text":"My favorite little thai place!  I always get the khu khai or the fried chicken over fried rice or the bbq pork over fried rice! They have really good soups too!"}
{"text":"Good food coupled with good service.

Have been a customer at both the Wynn Rd and Ft Apache locations, this location is closer to home so far more convenient.

The food is delicious, flavorful and plentiful. All at a very reasonable price.

Duck curry and duck rice are two of my favorite dishes here."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to come here last night, what a delight! The manager came over and introduced herself while telling us that they were short staffed. Honestly, the food was totally worth the extra 10-15 mins we waited. There wasn't one thing that anyone ordered that wasn't eaten completely. Clean plates for all of us! And the prices were superb! 
My husband and I had: shrimp Tum yum, chicken satay, grilled chicken salad and red curry, the total, $36! You can't beat that!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Decent price and Very spicy... just the way i like it. 
They delivered to my house and the food felt so hot it was as if it just came of the stove!"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food in the heart of Vegas! Definitely a must go for any Thai food lovers."}
{"text":"This place was horrible, their service was terrible, and the food was ok. No napkins were given when the food was served and I had to ask for a refill. When waiting for the check I had get up and find a server who was sitting down eating their lunch at the same time. No kind of condiments were made available while I ate making this experience an unpleasant one. I will NOT return for seconds!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken satay, chicken pad Thai and Thai ice tea. DELISH!! Great price and nice portions!!! I had my food delivered and was very please with how fast they got here and the food was still hot!! Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in town. It is located on Wynn and Spring Mountain, it is really small but cozy. It can get really busy on the weekend. We ordered tofu flat noodles, spring and pork noodles and two Thai teas. The foods were delicious and tasty, the Thai teas were perfect but we literally had to wait 25 mins for our food and the restaurant was not busy. Hopefully the next visit we won't have to wait this long."}
{"text":"One thing I will give this place is the prices of their food. Their normal entrees of Thai staples like fried rice, pad thai, and pad see ew were pretty decently priced. For the price, the portions weren't too bad at all. For the taste and the service, it's a little bit iffy.

When I received my order of pad thai, the thing I noticed was a good third of my plate was occupied by bean sprouts and the rest of noodles. They have this illusion that you got a lot of food, when all you got was an average amount. I did not really like how they did that, but it was $6.95, what's there to complain about? The taste of the pad thai was how you expect it to taste, so nothing funky there. When the pad see ew came, a lot more food looked present than in the pad thai. That was a very good sign to me! But the bad thing was that it had a funky after taste that I'm not use to. It's not the typical taste that I have had at other places, and the aftertaste wasn't a good aftertaste either. I don't know if that's how they normally make it or it was just that day, but I didn't like it too much. The fried rice that my friends ordered though, especially the fried chicken fried rice looked pretty epic... I should have gotten that, had I known how much they would give for that. Well, their portions were good, but it didn't really make up for the service that bothered me a little bit. 

The waitresses were nice and served us appropriately. They took our orders in a timely fashion and refilled our waters before it hit the bottom of the glass, but the thing that bothered me was that they rushed our party a little bit toward the end of our meal. This particular location is a little small, and so larger parties are going to have a hard time being seated. My party consisted of 6 and we had a little trouble being seated. When another party came in that was 6 as well, they kind if made it a point they wanted us out to sit the next people. I understand it's a business and they want to make money, but you shouldn't shoo away the customers that you have for the next set. That's fairly rude if you ask me. So after a bit, my friends finished eating and we headed out. 

I won't be coming back here under my own choosing. I'm not really big on the service, or the taste of the Thai food, but it's decently cheap for the portions they give you and so if you want value, I will recommend this place, but not so much on taste & service."}
{"text":"I finally made it to this newer location and the first thing I noticed was the very small size of the restaurant. It's probably less than half the size of the one in the SW. That's not a bad thing cuz size doesn't matter...just as long as you can work with what you got. The decor is actually very stunning. It was decorated with all my fave elements: glass mosaic tile, high back chairs with button tufting, and a beautiful chandelier. It was an aesthetic, pleasant surprise to see a mom and pop establishment so nicely decorated.

Anyhow, I've been craving some noodles and I went with the intention of ordering the Thai beef noodle soup. From what I can remember, Thai noodle soup has a much better flavor than pho IMO. As I was looking at the different noodle soups I noticed one called Pork and Fish Ball noodle soup. Man, I am so glad I went with his one--this bowl of soup was absolutely delightful. You get your choice of four different types of noodles, i went with the flat rice noodles for my bowl. It contains pork, ground pork, and fish balls in a chicken broth. It is garnished with fried garlic, which is the one ingredient that pulls all these great flavors together so well. The broth had a nice clean taste to it with a hint of white pepper. It looks pretty simple but the flavors are so good, I didn't wanna mess with it by adding anything to it. I left it unembellished and ate it all as it came. This is one of the few noodle soup dishes that I didn't feel the need to doctor up with hoison or sriracha.

The ingredients in this soup was reminiscent of what comes in my fave noodle soup dish called Phnom Penh noodles. The Vietnamese make a version of this soup and they call it hue tieu Nam Vang but I have not been able to find a worthy substitute for my PP noodles until now. 

Great prices, great noodle dishes and friendly service. So glad this 3rd location opened up so I don't have to go to Chinatown or the SW for some awesome noodle soup."}
{"text":"i ordered, spicy string bean w/chicken. i love spice, it was level 7.... and i thought i was going to have no tongue haha  will order maybe a 4 next time. 
the tom ka soup is sweeter then most places, but still good.
mango with sweet rice is NUMMY and amazing.
i loved all the prices and i love how fast the delivery was. my food was even HOT not warm from the drive. 
i say yes to this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is a hit or miss. Food quality is always on par."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good thai food spot with great prices this is it. Every Curry I've had is good. The tom kha and tom yum soups are always a great start with tons of flavor. And the thai beef salad is delicious."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to Vegas, I always make it a point to eat here at least once. Why? Read more below.

Small place but this is one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to! Probably THE best, I should say. The food is made fresh, homestyle. I've had different rice dishes, curries, tom yum, vegetables, and they're all sooooo good! If i ask for extra spicy, it doesn't really come out too spicy, but with the amount of love and flavor that's in the food, you won't need it. Coconut juice is way too sweet, though..I had to water it down 50% with water. Everything else was delicious and even the hard-to-please loved this place. On top of all of that, the customer service here is impeccable!

Thank you, Chinatown, for housing this little gem!"}
{"text":"Was is the mood for Thai Food and found this hidden gem. The pot stickers are the best I've ever had, chicken satay was tender and tasty. For our main course we had the beef noodle soup and chicken Pad Thai.....amazing!!!! You are dumb not to try this place!"}
{"text":"So I called this place for delivery while I was staying at the Rio. 

I had visited Hoover Dam, had ziplined from the rooftops of the Rio, bought a wedding dress, and had been walking around and my feet hurt. Once I got to my room at 9:00pm, the last thing I wanted to do was go back to the valet to get my car, or walk around the strip to find a place to eat because that would have taken time and I would have been hungry, cranky, starving and grumpy at 10:00pm while walking/driving around aimlessly trying to find a restaurant.

Here comes yelp to save the day. At this point, I don't care who brings me food. There were some bad reviews but like I said, at this point in the evening, with hungry kids in the hotel room, who cares. So we placed our order over the phone and waited...

They only deliver to the front valet drop-off area probably because they don't want to take the time to park and navigate the hotel to find your room. That's understandable. The delivery guy called when he was 5 minutes away. We were already waiting downstairs but that was a nice gesture to make things run as efficiently as possible. We expected a guy to roll up and toss us the food through the window but he didn't do that. We were focused on the cars and didn't even spot him until we realized there's a guy standing on the sidewalk across from us holding bags of food. 

We ordered the fried calamari, orange chicken with sauce on the side, wonton soup, wonton noodle soup, pad Thai, panang beef, crab fried rice, and extra steamed rice. The portions were generous, prices were reasonable, quality and taste were average. It was exactly an hour when the food arrived. I timed the exact moment we called in the order. I think that was pretty quick considering they had to make the food, package it, and drive it to us, all within that time frame. We forgot to ask for plates and they didn't ask us either. The only disappointment is that I expected lots of crab meat in the crab fried rice similar to OSHA Thai or at least some lump crab pieces but instead it was just fried rice topped with a scrambled egg/crab mixture. It also lacked the aromatic crabby smell which I love but overall, it did the job. It fed our starving party of 6 dinner in our hotel room and we still had enough leftover for a breakfast snack the next morning."}
{"text":"I decided to try it because of the price. I'm a devout Archi's fan, but wanted to see if there was more out there. I shall never stray again. Even though the prices are a lot cheaper than the rest of the Thai places, the quality was a bit disappointing. I ordered Papaya Salad, Pad See Ew, and Chicken Tom Yum. Papaya Salad was average, if not satisfactory. I did like the Tom Yum although it was a bit too sweet. The disappointment finally came when I tried the Pad See Ew. It was too salty, no real sauce flavor and pretty boring. 

For the price of around 6-7, you can't really complain, but when it comes to my beloved Thai food, I'm willing to pay a few bucks more for better taste...."}
{"text":"cheap. delicious. CHEAP.
the food here is absolutely amazing and for the price that they're charging, you can't complain. the crab fried rice was really good as well as the roasted duck curry. i would most definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"I really liked the Thai style noodle house on fortapache and was really excited when I found out they had one closer to home. At first glance I thought the new place looked really cool. Then after taking a seat I realized the atmosphere was very strange. The space felt really big and empty even though there were others eating in the restaurant. The servers were nice, but not very attentive. The food was good, for the price. I had the three companion. The chicken was decent, portion wasn't satisfying, though. The sticky rice was nice and hot. The som tum was alright. Albeit The decor is still \"cool\",  but I rather drive the extra ten minutes to the other location where the atmosphere makes me feel like I'm out eating rather than the feeling of eating alone at home. However, I would still come back to this location of I'm short on time. It's not bad, not great. It's good. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Their lunch specials are reasonably priced and tasty too.  Went here for lunch with a friend on a Sunday and we had an yummy meal as well as excellent service.  My friend ordered panang curry and I had tofu & vegetables.  My friend also ordered a papaya salad to go.  The waitresses were nice and very helpful explaining dishes and spice levels.  I would return to try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Cheap, with vegan options! Yum! I The portions are huge for the appetizer and sides so if you're only a little hungry or have only a little money, so for a side and/or an appetizer. My favorite is the plain fried rice, no egg, with tofu!"}
{"text":"Maribel T. found this place. We met up with her BFF here on a Friday night and it wasn't busy at all. There were about 9 of us that ate. The other half got there before us and ordered a whole bunch of appetizers. We then ordered some entrees and everything was good! I ordered the Beef Pad Thai, my friend got the Yellow Curry Chicken and Pineapple Fried Rice and Maribel T. ordered fried pork. Everything was Yummy! I was surprised with myself that I actually liked the curry as I am not really into curry. I'm either getting use to it, or their curry wasn't too curry for me, it was just right.  The prices are also reasonable, I think our tab was around $125 which was about 9 different entrees and quite a few orders of appetizers.

Maribel T. told me they have good papaya salad from Yelp reviews. I usually go on Yelp before trying out a new restaurant, but I didn't go it this time. I should have gone with my gut feeling in ordering papaya salad...I ended up craving it later one...Ha! a reason to go back here :)

Why 4 stars, instead of 5 stars? A little hard to find and I didn't like that the waitresses kept looking at our table to see if we were done eating, instead of coming up to our table and ask if we were done, give us our check or ask us if we needed boxes. One of my pet peeves is being stared at while eating or the feeling of being rushed...

Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"The decor isnt what I expected from a Thai restaurant but it's cute and spacious. We havent had to wait long to be seated either. The staff is sweet and friendly. The food comes out rather quickly. Their pad see ew is one of my favorites. I like that their steamed rice is a good portion and is a lot bigger than the portions I usually get from other Asian restaurants. Their fried chicken over fried rice is good too!"}
{"text":"I found a new little Thai Spot close to the house they deliver tried some new things the green curry fried rice was yummy also had shrimp pineapple red curry that was super yummy ordered my go-to Pad See Ew noodles also delicious service is good it's small but cute the wontons were a little different not sure if I cared for those so much but all in all I will be going back"}
{"text":"Favorite thai place in Vegas!!!! A friend and I went there for the first time because we found it on yelp, and I haven't stop frequenting it since! I have tried a lot of different items of the menu and everything is delicious!!!nevertheless, I have a clear favorite, number 38!!!flat fried noodles with egg and sweet and sour sauce...to die for!!! Totally recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would. We were seated and it was right next to the kitchen that had pans with a mountain of chicken just sitting on the counter. Went to wash my hands and The bathrooms had no soap and were disgusting, so as soon as I returned to the table we all decided we should leave. We couldn't even Stomach to eat there and I have no idea how it has 4 stars!!"}
{"text":"When I'm craving Thai food and want to go somewhere nearby this is my first stop. Overall the food is good, but nothing special. The service can be better, because I sometimes have to sit and wait for a server to approach me."}
{"text":"So, I'm disappointed. 

For me, one of the most beautiful things about living in this town is the accessibility to good food and even better service at all price points at the drop of a hat. 

AMAZING restaurants with little to no wait...EVER. I started going to Thai Style Noodle house a few years ago at the Ft. Apache location. They have amazing food, at great prices...it was my \"go to\" for takeout dinners. 

To my pleasant surprise, I found this location near my work. I frequent Soho House and Scoop in the same strip mall (both of which are spectacular). 

So let's get some perspective. My husband and I are in our mid 30's. Both professionals, and eat out 6 nights a week...solid. We don't cook. We go to Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, American, Indian...you name it, we like it. We are true foodies. 

To be fair, the food/price balance here is excellent. I've never had anything but delicious food from the Ft. Apache location. 

But this location.  Ugh. 

We order from this place (from the office) on average once every 2 weeks.  I get the same thing for lunch every time. Every time, I get pad see ew with a level 3 out of 10 spice.   Side note: I put sriracha on my foods, I get the hot salsa at Mexican restaurants...I'm good with spice. But at lunch, with the pad see ew, I get a 3 because I don't want the spice to take anything away from the delicious flavor of the noodles themselves. 

Sometimes I'm sad and I can't taste any of the spice. I figure, it's ok. Still delicious. 

But today...today we ordered the same. When I opened the box, I knew there was a problem. I could see red everywhere. Every single bite I loaded on my fork had visibly 10-15 specks of red chili flakes.  I took 3 bites and was literally sweating. SWEATING!!  My pregnant coworker who can't get enough spice had ordered a level 5 out of 10 and couldn't even put down 3 bites!!  

We called, politely explaining that the food was nearly inedible and guess what we got??? 

ATTITUDE!  

We were told \"WELL IM NOT CREDITING YOU UNLESS YOU BRING BACK THE UNEATEN FOOD\". Wow??  Who asked for a refund?  We want lunch. 

Then when we said \"ok, we can bring it back\" we got a lecture about spice. 

Anyways....

When we walk in, we get eye rolling from the young man working the counter. And he proceeds to tell us (literally, no exaggeration) \"WE CAN NOT CONTROL THE SPICE. IT DEPEND ON THE CHILLI\". 

Are you EFFING kidding?  Have I not eaten Thai food a thousand times?!  Then he refuses to make the food with any spice. 

I've never met a ruder person. To be so rude and diva-like to two women who just want some edible lunch!!  

I won't be coming back. I guess that's why this place is always empty. Lol. 

I used to feel bad and always suggest it to people. No more!!!  Stay away!!!  

There are a dozen other Thai restaurants in a 5 mile radius. Go elsewhere!!  

To management or the owner, take note that customer service MEANS something. And you've lost a customer (and anyone I can tell)."}
{"text":"Friends wanted to eat someThai food and we ended up here.  It's a small place tuck in the the corner of the busy intersection.  

We ordered a bunch of food and shared it with each other.  The beef larb was probably the tastiest with the beef pad see ew. The pot stickers were pretty tasty. The pad Thai was a bit different in the sense that they used like the thinner style noodles.  The fried chicken wasn't too bad, especially when dipped with sauces. 

Overall,  place wasn't too bad and pretty inexpwnsive for all the food we ordered"}
{"text":"We eat here pretty often because it's close to work and has vegan options.  First thing is the Vegan Pot Stickers are absolutely amazing and I'm not even vegan.  I can't even describe how delicious they taste. some of the other dishes that are pretty good Pineapple chicken, Fried Chicken over Fried rice. 

To be honest it kind of took me a while to find something that I liked here.   I usually love Red Curry, but their version doesn't suit me.  But seriously the pot stickers are pretty spectacular.  

Update:  We just ordered the pot stickers again.  I guess you can also get them in a not vegan option.  However, I am not willing to chance it, as the vegan ones are so absolutely delicious.  I was not thrilled to find that they don't have fresh brewed ice tea, but what can you do."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place! If u haven't given it a chance yet, please do so. We went there  while trying to find a thai place in this area of town and as soon as we walked in we weere hooked! 
This might seem odd, but i feel like i get more shrimp in my pad thai when i dine in, rather than when i have food delivered or pixking it up. 
Overall, i will be going back for a long long time!!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai place in Vegas that I've eaten so far, especially for the price - quantity ratio. The pad Thai I ordered today was a very generous plate that other Thai places would consider dinner price and would charge $10+ for. Thai Style Noodle House only charges $6.95! (Shrimp only 7.95). Noodles were perfect spice level, perfect texture and tagged delicious. As a big fan of Thai food, spicy food, and large portions, would definitely recommend this place! Additionally, service was quick and there is plenty of variety on the menu. Two reasonably large dishes would only put your bill around $15.00-$20.00, easily double the value of most restaurants nowadays."}
{"text":"Had lunch specials very tasty. Will definitely go back. Fast, courteous service, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"When we showed up they only had a table for 2 left, it was packed, but with only 12 tables you blink and it's a waiting list.  It might be tiny on size but the dishes had alot and were very good.  I had the chicken pad thai and the bbq chicken over rice, they both were very good.  One per son waiting on the entire place but it semed to work.  Going back for the soup next time-bowls were huge!!"}
{"text":"What can I say, this place is awesome, only 4stars is because I'm sure there are better places (it's no Lotus of Siam) but this place makes me keep coming back for flavor and value, and the last three times I've ordered something  to go so I have lunch the next day, I just wound up going last night got the sliced beef noodle soup and the pad see ew chicken to go, how can you beat the 6.95 price on each items, both massive portions"}
{"text":"OKAAAY! So, this place is LEGIT! Thank youuuu Yelpers. I went two days in a row, and plan to return MANY times! 

Such a hidden location, and so quaint! But man, the food here is GOOD. 

DAY 1:

2 BIG mugs of Thai Iced Tea :)
i especially love the huge beer mug they serve it in.

Combo Appetizer
Love the chicken satay! Mmm... and the onions and cucumbers in the small bowl! Everything else was pretty good. A nice way to start.

Duck Fried Rice
duuuuude, seriously, this was the hook once I opened up that tri-fold menu! It was deeeelicious, and I could not stop raving about how big the pieces of duck were in it!

#S11
The name of the actual dish slips my mind, but my boyfriend and I ordered it medium-spicy thinking it was going to be okay, but IT WAS HOT but not so hot to mask the actual food! I am not used to spice, but I ate it as fast as I could, still enjoying the dish, so as not to torture my inexperienced taste buds.

DAY 2:

Just ONE big mug of Thai Iced Tea

Thai Style Noodle House Pot Stickers
You get 6 of them! They are deep fried and have 3 different sauces on them, something like a sweet mayo, then a teriyaki, and some sriracha all across the tops! Our waitress actually informed us it was the most popular appetizer ordered. Sold. It was a good mixture of sauces! Thought it would be too much, but it was great together.

Seafood Rad-Na with Wonton
Saw this cute little dish hand-drawn/written on a piece of paper on the wall near us! Couldn't resist. This dish was decent, but still enjoyed it!

Three Companions (Pork)
The pork is soft! It's marinated I believe, and the papaya salad and sticky rice it comes with were all good!

Then, a Thai Iced Tea to go.

Okay, so all in all, both days, both bills were under $35! The portions were large! The service is off the hook! And the environment is so friendly! The waitress with the glasses is wonderful! She remembered us from the previous day! The bathrooms are clean, both boys and girls, and we were always checked up on!

Thai Style Noodle House will definitely be a stop for me while in China Town. I do plan on returning to try the noodle soups, as I had seen several HUGE bowls of soup being served, and at reasonable prices! Forget my Pho during the winter! I'm coming HERE!"}
{"text":"Good food. Not expensive at all. Ordered Pad Thai, Orange chicken and sweet and sour pork. It wasn't bad. Orange chicken was delicious! So was sweet and sour pork... but it didn't have very much pork, it was more vegetables. And Pad Thai was decent. It was more spicy than flavorful, I've had better Pad Thai for sure. I will come back to try other menu items since this was our first visit."}
{"text":"Good golly, if it weren't for my co-workers asking one another, \"where do you wanna go for lunch?\" and defaulting to Thai food 3 to 4 times a week, I probably wouldn't come to Thai Noodle House as often as I do.

Items on the menu are reasonably priced whether you go ala carte or go with a lunch combo.

If you have an hour for lunch and you're withn 4-miles of this particular location, the service is quick that you can sit, enjoy your meal, and back to work on time.."}
{"text":"Nice, clean restaurant. Very good service, nice people. This is the first Thai food I've tried since coming back from visiting Thailand. The food here was at least as good or better than any food I had in Thailand. Everything tasted great. It was all very fresh. I had duck fried rice, pad thai, orange chicken and sweet sticky rice with ice cream. This is definitely a place I will come to again. Can't wait to try more of their dishes. They do an excellent job."}
{"text":"I had the pad Thai chicken was good! Pas Thai noodles were very thin, I personally prefer thicker noodles. Also ordered the duck fried rice, was a bit too chewy for my taste. Potstickers were tastyy and sticky fried ice cream was good too."}
{"text":"Really disappointed at the food! I had the Combo Beef Noodle soup. The noodles were soggy and the broth wasn't even hot when I got it. The Pad Thai was not tasty. Overall, I was really disappointed because I came here to get some good Thai comfort food before leaving Vegas. Service was ok. Def won't be coming back."}
{"text":"First impressions: I immediately noticed the peculiar Barney-color purple paint and grey tufted booth seating. Along the far left wall, there are three more booths that offer more privacy -- kind of like having your own VIP section. A regal wooden paneling envelops one side of the restaurant dotted with white tufted single chairs. I know they're trying to look modern, but for me, it comes off disjointed and more of a beauty salon look... but hey, at least it's clean! 

Food: Of course, my bf ordered the chicken yellow curry. His review of his dish is that they skimped on the chicken and used sweet potatoes instead of regular ones. Fair enough. I had their pad see ewe with tofu. They give you the option of soft or fried, so I went with the latter. Let me just say, this is probably one of the best pad see ewes I've had! (Yeah, really!) It was just the right portion and they sprinkle it with some type of fried garlic on top. Price-wise, they're a little bit cheaper than comparable Thai places, so I was quite surprised. 

Service was good. It could have been better considering there was literally only one other table besides us there, but the workers seem to be on their own breaks? Not sure, but I'd definitely wouldn't rule them out. We'll be back!

PS -- There are 4 locations in Vegas (Jones, Rampart, Fort Apache, and Chinatown.)"}
{"text":"The Noodle House is a gem. I bring all my out of town guests here as well as my friends. I tell them, this is a small hole in the wall, and it is a treasure in Chinatown to those who frequent the restaurant. Being small, I am mindful to come between prime time meal rushes to avoid a wait. The servers have come to know me, and I believe in the last two years I have only seen the same two girls! The tables can be very close so it is not the place for an intimate conversation, and close enough where I become friends with a neighboring diner!!!

I love their noodle dishes, however at the suggestion of a young Thai woman (my neighbor dining friend\" suggested I try the Salmon Avocado Panang Curry with a heat of 8 and I am in LOVE! I cannot get enough of it! The combination of flavors, and the fat textures of the coconut cream and avocado with chili oil to cut it is a pairing made in heaven.

Happy Eating DMW"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, terrible food, and what happened after I left the place gave me a sour taste. 

At first they came to us immediately asking to take our order but I said that we needed a couple more minutes. This turned into 20 minutes. No one came back. I had to flag someone down just to take our order.

Next, they did not even check up on us if we needed anything else. (Napkins, refill, if we are doing okay, etc.). The food was bland and was horribly made. Would not recommend. I don't know how this place is getting 5 stars!!

Since no one came by at all I had to go up and find somebody just to get my check. The weirdest part is that this place was nowhere near busy! So why didn't they check up on their customers? Why do I have to walk from my table all the way to the counter just to ask for someone to take our order, get us items, and our check? 

When I left this place, the server FOUND ME ON FACEBOOK AND MESSAGED ME. He sent me a photo of the receipt and asked if I had put down my real signature. SO INTRUSIVE!!!!!  He also started the sentence when he messaged me with \"I know it's very intrusive.\" UH yeah, I felt so uncomfortable from just this alone. 

I would have been open to trying the place again if the staff did not try to message me on Facebook. That is not professional at all."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about Thai Style Noodle House from my vegan friend Don before I joined Yelp. And then, the accolades came pouring for this hole in the wall joint on Yelp. Of course, I had to come see for myself. I'm surprised it's taken me this long.

We entered the restaurant and it was exactly as I expected. T shirts on the wall, a couple of small pictures hanging up, old tables and chairs. The 2 waitresses for the night were having their own dinner in the corner but they were quick to give us the menus and take our drink order. I appreciated that. While we looked at the menu, the waitress was kind enough to ask us if we were meat-challenged and then whipped out a vegetarian menu for us to order from. Yay! 

Our order tonight:

Papaya Salad : Green Beans, slivered raw papaya, tomatoes in a tangy, sweet dressing with just a hint of spice after every mouthful. I was licking the plate clean. I thoroughly enjoyed this salad

Basil Fried Rice with Fried Tofu : My husband's order. I ended up eating lots of it. The fried tofu tasted divine. Honestly, there wasn't much of the basil flavoring in the rice but I still thought it was tasty. My husband wasn't a big fan as he thought it didn't really taste like how it was supposed to (he swears by Komol's Basil Fried Rice)

Green Beans and Tofu in a Red Curry Paste : This was my least favorite of the 3 dishes we ordered. It tasted sort of strange...and very much like the red curry paste was processed. My husband actually quite enjoyed it and said there was a lemongrass taste to it that was pleasant but I have to differ on his opinion. 

Our total bill (including a 15% tip) came up to 25 bucks. This cannot be beat. Period.

Yes, the portions can't feed 16 people and the restaurant might need some interior decorating intervention but I thought the taste of the food was good, the menu interesting, the service friendly and fast and the price very reasonable. 

I will definitely be back...maybe for a lunch special or the Khua Kai Noodles which sound so interesting. Komol still ranks my Number 1 in Thai favs but this little treasure has definitely earned a place in my go-to restaurants."}
{"text":"Small little Thai restaurant in Chinatown! 

When we arrived right before lunch time on a Sunday, it wasn't too crowded, just one other table. We ordered and by the time our food arrived all the tables were full. 

I ordered the yen to fo noodles:
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=KnaYT5QPzf1s79FqVfIg5Q
Flavor was good and I really liked that they added the fried wonton. I haven't had this soup for years, so it was nice to see it on the menu. 

And speaking of menu, they had such an extensive menu with lots of Thai dishes that you usually don't see. Everything we ordered was great. So if your in Vegas and your craving Thai food then this place is a great little Thai restaurant. 

By the time we headed off, there was a line next out the door waiting. After getting Thai food, make sure you also check out the poke place next door!"}
{"text":"OMG!!
I am contemplating moving to Las Vegas to live near this restaurant. 
This is definitely a hole in the wall. If you are expecting nice glass plates, fancy food presentation, etc this is not your place. If you want great authentic food for a cheap price than this is your place. I knew I had hit it big when I saw the sweet little grandma in the kitchen cooking up a storm. I got the spicy noodles (YUMMMM) and my husband got the pad thai (YUMMM again). There were only 2 servers and they did such a great job handling the whole restaurant. They were both cordial and prompt. I am so glad we came across this place. Thanks yelpers!!"}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Thai/Chinese food. Often go here with friends when I'm in town. Price is very reasonable. The Chinese broccoli with crispy pork (it's on the whiteboard menu) is a must try, along with the Fried rice with bbq pork and Chinese sausage. Everything else is fair game as well but those are the two items we always order. The Thai iced tea comes in two sizes, regular and x-large (x-large comes in a huge Styrofoam container) and although sweet, tastes great. Staff is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Food here is amazing, very authentic, and quick service. Also it's very reasonably priced, definitely one of my go to places for Thai/Chinese food."}
{"text":"My god - a Thai heaven.

We were all vegetarians. We got the green curry, yellow curry, pad thai, edamame and the soup. Everything was insanely good. We spent 2 hours in this restaurant. Never knew Las Vegas would be the place for an amazing Thai restaurant and this is from a person who studied in Singapore and frequented Thailand."}
{"text":"My first visit here and although I am not blown away by what I had, it was good enough to warrant another visit.  Although there were plenty of lunch time patrons at this place, the food was still served pretty fast.  I ordered the Thai Style Tom Yum noodle soup with rice vermicelli only because my wife said the Tom Yum was good.  I don't really care for Tom Yum flavour and the rice vermicelli.  I don't think it was a good combination with this type of soup.  So I guess I was a little disappointed with this dish.  I also tried to order their duck fried rice, but to my dismay, they ran out of duck, so I had to settle for the crab fried rice instead.  The fried rice did have real crab meat in it, but there weren't that many pieces and the flavour of the crab was not infused into the fried rice, so again I was disappointed.  But then I saw the table next to me was eating the rad na with what looked like wonton noodles and it looked good.  So on a separate occasion, I ordered the rad na to take out.  Now this dish was quite flavourful. Redemption!!  There was just the right amount of gravy in there and although the greens turned a little yellow by the time I got home to eat it, the texture of the gai lan was still good.  I will definitely go back and try some of their other dishes, namely their curries."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food was so good !! But my only complaint was this place is too small.  Other than that service was good price was perfect because you can't get this price at the hotel or not even the tast at the 5 stars hotel .... I would recommend this place for my friends and families every times"}
{"text":"The best Thai food for your buck, hands down. My mother has owned a Thai restaurant for over 25 years and this place has great food! The value is unbeatable and the service is great too! I highly recommend this restaurant. I haven't tried the other locations as this is the closest one to my house. It's my husband and I's go to spot when we decide to eat out. They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!"}
{"text":"They must put drugs in the food, because I'm addicted! Haha. This is our local Thai place that's right around the corner. My husband an I have been here several times (both take out and dine in) and we have had amazing food each time. So far we haven't had one thing we really disliked. Our favorite things here are the green curry, and the Tom Kha soup. Definitely recommend this place for take out or a quick, casual dine in. Maybe you'll be hooked too! ;-P"}
{"text":"Definitely where the locals eat. Very good Sticky Rice and Mango. Green Cury is delicious. Pad Thai is yummy! Tom Kha soup is really good too!!!Fried Rice is also good. Thai tea w/ milk is also very spot on! I ate here twice while in town. I'm forever coming back.  Staff is also very friendly and professional!"}
{"text":"I recently moved here from LA and I have asked every Thai or Laos person where I can find authentic Thai boat noodles, oh I should add I am Laos and have had authentic Thai and Laos food from the motherland. Anyways, to my disappointment no one could give me a definite answer to replenish my craving. Until I stumbled upon this quaint little establishment. For the record, I am only reviewing their Thai boat noodles because I can eat everything else on the menu any time I want. Overall it was pretty good and satisfied my craving. I am glad it's near my house and was not over priced like most Asian spots s in SW and MTN edge. This Asian spots charge almost $10.00 for sub par Pho. Rip off! I recommend you try this dish if you haven't."}
{"text":"I like this place has all the dishes i like and the flavor is all there. Lately, the portion size has becoming smaller which my husband is not pleased with. But still a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre (tofu and vegetable lunch special) to good (Noodle House Tom Yum Soup Bowl), but not great. Service was poor. Despite having two waitresses asking us the same things over and over, we had to ask for water 4 times before actually getting any."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy this place for thai food. They are close to home and decent priced. Have yet to be dissatisfied with their food."}
{"text":"Good inexpensive place great food and great price!
No parking had to look for out own but nice servers"}
{"text":"Amazing thaii food at amazing prices.  This is one of the true gems in Las Vegas!!  I've eat here at least once a week.  Each time I always get the duck fried rice.  It is truly delectable!  I usually order it with a heat of 4 and add more spiciness to it depending on my mood.  I first discovered this place getting food for my wife and I one night at the Palms.  We ordered the Tom Yum Kai w/chicken.  The noodle soup was fabulous!  The amazing flavor combination of the soup was intense.  One can taste the sour, sweet, tangy and a bit of heat all in one taste.  The flavors are intense.

I then tried the duck fried rice and I was hooked!  The sweetness of the duck, combined with the heat and flavors of the rice was a perfect combination.  I love the way they put the dish together.  I've also tried the Spicy Thai noodles, Pad Thai and Pad See Eww.  All were great with a bounty of flavors.  Nothing over $10!!!

If you are looking for ambiance and romance, you probably would choose another location.  If you are looking for amazing food at an amazing price (nothing over $10) I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Supposedly, this place closed recently for renovations. I never saw the old look, but the new one is nothing special, although the paint on the walls looks fresh. But, of course, people don't come here for the atmosphere and interior. It's for the tasty eats and the roasted duck noodle soup is just that. With plenty of flat noodles, sprouts, and duck, it's comforting and satisfying. At $6.95 it's also a great value.

They do take credit cards, but there's a $15 minimum."}
{"text":"This place is close to my house and the food is fairly tasty for the price. I would go in for lunch or dinner a few times a month and never had a bad experience until today. I placed a to go order for Tom Yum Soup with egg noodles. The guy taking my order repeated the order back to me and stated egg noodles. When I got home, there were no egg noodles. I really wanted the noodles, so I drove back to the restaurant. Instead of apologizing or getting me egg noodles, the guy pulls the ticket for the order to show me there were no egg noodles on it and that it was my fault. I told him he stated egg noodles when he repeated order but he said no. He said if I wanted egg noodles, I would have to pay 1.50. At this point, it wasn't about the additional cost, but the lack of customer service. I walked out. I won't be going back there again. I regret giving a tip for my to go order."}
{"text":"Nice variety of thai food.  Cheap prices and the taste was good.  Feigning for rice on this trip... I ordered the eggplant stirfry with rice.  It was yummy and they offered a Vegetarian menu.  I'm definitely coming here again if in the area of Las Vegas and craving thai food.  Yum.  Thanks, Thai Style Noodle House.  I think you were the food highlight of my trip compared to my other stops. :)

And it was packed in and out while I was there.  That's usually a good sign. :)"}
{"text":"The perfect little gem in Summerlin. I just had dinner there yesterday & I want more! The Tom Kha soup has a lighter, fresher taste than most I've tried, and the chicken & shrimp Pad Thai was delish. Can't wait to try  other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I like the Thai fried rice because it is a good price for a decently large portion which makes it easy to pick up for dinner and have as leftovers the next day. But I've noticed if you don't say \"Thai fried rice\" and just \"fried rice\" they do taste different so be careful of that. Most other things I've tried are decent but not amazing like the pad seeu is better sometimes than others because at times it has a bitter after taste even when it tastes good at first. Their crab wontons are pretty good (hard to mess those up) and their Thai soup has good flavor."}
{"text":"Good place for an inexpensive and tasty Thai fix. Get takeout here at least once a month. The beef combination soup and chicken pad Thai are delicious. Total of 4 stars for the shrimp dishes and chicken larb which is bland."}
{"text":"Finally a good Thai place on this side of town, and it's cheap! We've been eating here every day and definitely not stopping anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with my family to try the restaurant.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to try the food because of the horrible and rude server that started to wait on us.  She didn't smile and basically acted like we were pissing her off by being there.  We asked for beverages a few minutes after she threw the menus down.  She forgot one of the beverages so I asked her about it.  The look on her face was of utter disgust.  I saw her talk to a co-worker obviously complaining about us because she was pointing at us.  She came back and threw down some plates and silverware.  She was the rudest server I have ever encountered in Vegas.  I have been in the food and beverage field for decades.  I asked for the manager and she laughed and said \"no manager\".  My mom was pretty upset at the service so far so all 6 of us left.  We ended up going to a Chinese fusion restaurant several doors down from your restaurant and had phenomenal service.  Whoever owns this business should train your servers to actually be polite.  I eat out several times a week and you just lost my and my family's business."}
{"text":"Here now and couldn't wait to review, it's a cute little store front hidden off the main path. You walk into a family style Thai hidden gem. Just had the papaya salad and it was the perfect level of spicy not overwhelming but just enough to leave your lips wanting more. Letting my yellow veggie pumpkin curry cool down before I enjoy my main course. Yes I just said veggie pumpkin yellow curry :)"}
{"text":"Just moved to Vegas and didn't want to drive all the way to Spring Mountain road to find a Thai place to eat at.  I found this little place on a Saturday night.  It wasn't too busy when I got in so I got a table right away.

I ordered a rad-na beef, 0 spicy and substituted american broccoli.  My order came out exactly as I wanted, and tasted exactly what I wanted it too.  The only thing was (in a good way)... HOLY PORTION SIZE.  I'm used to eating rad-na on plate at other thai places- but here, they give you a Pho bowl, and its sauce and portions are generous, if not intimidating.  Was good to the last bite.  

I think this place is a chain.  But this place was good for me and the pricing too.  I love trying out new places, so don't know if I'll be back, but its a definite recommend!"}
{"text":"So my parents have eaten twice at restaurants where the strip mall that has ranch 99 is, and have struck out twice.  They walked by this place during one of those meals and wanted to try it, so I took them here.  This is probably the best Thai places in Las Vegas.  When you think hole in the wall with amazing food, this is it.  It doesn't look too shabby, and you probably would miss it driving past it.  But the food makes up for the appearance and size of the restaurant.

We came for dinner on a Thursday night.  We got seated right away.  This restaurant is very small about 10 tables anywhere from 2-4 people.  The restaurant started to get sort of full right away.  We ended up ordering the calamari, Beef fried rice,rad na beef substitute american broccoli instead of Chinese, and one more dish I forget the name was, but I took a picture of it.

The rice came out first and was just enough for 3 people.  And it was excellent.  I could of eaten all the fried rice on my own.  My parents had no complaints about the calimari or the other dish.  I had the rad na, and it was really really good.  I tried a thai place just last week and it was fine, but this place was in my opinion better.  I plan to come back whenever I can.  I highly recommend this place if all the choices on Spring Mountain Road are overwhelming."}
{"text":"Came here two days in a row! Its in the same plaza as Smith's. The service was good, gets busy around lunch but I've been able to get a seat fast.

Item: Combination Beef Noodle Soup
Portion: Big
Flavor: 5/5
Price: $8
Reminded me of Taiwanese beef noodle soup except a little bit more sour and less spicy. 

Item: Mango Sticky Rice
Portion: Small
Flavor: 3/5
Price: $5
The ratio of mango to rice was disappointing. They gave small slivers of mango compared to the bowl of rice. 

I wouldn't go back for their dessert but that soup is killer."}
{"text":"This space where Thai Style Noodle House #4 currently is located, used to be another Thai place that had weird textured chicken.  However, this regime served food that is nothing like the predecessor. 

I met my colleagues here for lunch and the prices are great!  One colleague ordered Crab fried rice ($7.95) while the other ordered beef penang curry (6.95).  I ordered the duck curry ($8.25) and Thai iced tea.  The spice scale is from 1 thru 10.  I ordered a 5 but tasted more like a 7.  However, the duck curry was spot on.  The curry was nice and thick, with small chunks of pineapple, bell pepper, and the right amount of basil.  The slices of duck were satisfactory.  This was good for 2 meals.  

On top of the food being delicious, this spot is a 5 minute drive from our workplace.  I am a fan, and will be coming back to get my Thai food cravings."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of people from work and the duck fried rice did not disappoint.  There were big chunks of duck meat in my dish, and 4 different kind of peppers to accompany it.  I also tasted the duck noodle soup and it was very flavorful as well.  This place is quite tiny so we were glad they were able to accommodate the 5 of us.  I also got a large Thai Ice Tea and it was very good.  They charge us gratuity for a party of 5 and it was fine (though I thought it would be for a part of 6 or more).  Service was excellent and food was excellent.  I came back again to order 2 duck fried rice, duck noodle soup, and a pad thai via yelp.  The pad thai was meh, however.  Overall, I do like TSNH and will return."}
{"text":"Tried their panang beef and their fried chicken on fried rice. Was pretty decent but nothing to rave over. We ended up here in the first place because we had a friend who is a vegetarian so we didn't go try the BBQ joint in Vegas. Would not come back here unless we were in the area. Food was good but not great."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The decor is modern and sleek. The food was good and the prices were amazing. Definitely will be going back. The silver noodle soup was just what I needed on a cold night."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I have had so far in Vegas. We went there for dinner a few months ago. This little restaurant is located near W lake mead and Rampart in Summerlin. We tried Pad See ew, duck fried rice, pad thai, they were all delicious. The Thai tea was the best thai tea. The price was cheap in my opinion and comes in generous portion. It was the best Thai food I have had. The service was good. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I had the lunch combo. Ginger chicken, wontons and rice. Good neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"After drinking and playing at the Golden Tiki I knew I needed something in my stomach so I walked over to Thai Style Noodle House and ordered a pad Thai with a Thai iced tea.  It's not Le Thai but it is pretty damn good.  Service was quick and friendly and I got my level 4 chicken pad Thai quickly.  The flavor was great and they noticed when I was finished and brought me a box and the bill.  If you plan to stop at the GT and want something in your stomach either before or after, i recommend this place."}
{"text":"First of all they ask on a scale of 1-10 how spicy..totally caught me off guard but I got a 5 and it was perfect.
I got tom yum with flat noodles and seafood and it definitely was not like regular tom yum. It was better!!! 
The green curry was okay. My fave is probably yellow out of all of them. 

The place is pretty small but everyone that works here is super nice. We came at the right time because after we sat down it was really crowded. 

The bill came out to less than 20$ for delicious food :)"}
{"text":"A little restaurant for the quick stop for Thai curry when hungry and in a hurry but enough time to sit and savor. Thai food is a favorite and this is authentic (to the Americanized palate. Authentic to me is being in Thailand with Thai ingredients), thus one of best Thai cuisine in Vegas. Tucked on a corner of Chinatown's shops, facing westside. Thai effervescence in the air will get you the hunger pangs. A photo menu book to aid your menu choices selection. Waitstaff attentive in service. My favorite is Yellow Curry with Pumpkin, Mixed Vegetables and Salmon made special order...request granted! with saucy flavor of coconut milk. Still affordable despite the additions to the order. Other variations of Salmon dish choices I try each time I visit. \"Pad Thai\" and \"Hoi-Tod\" (fried pancake with green mussels) is yummy. Spicy taste will add to the experience. Request the spicy hotness according to your \"bravery\". Thai cuisine lover or not, a good taste of spice!"}
{"text":"Just found out they were on Ch. 13's Dirty Dining in April.. ew"}
{"text":"I come here often since it's close to my house. Lately, the service hasn't been great and the food isn't as good, but I still liked it. Yesterday, 1/6/17 I was there with my friend and our chicken was completely pink on the inside. Make sure your food is thoroughly cooked if you come here."}
{"text":"I wrote my original review just a few days ago, so go check it out for more basic info about the place.

I've been back a couple of times since then and am more and more impressed every time I go.  Even though the server lineup has been different every time, they are very fast and attentive.  Absolute top notch customer service, perhaps surpassed only by Jin and his crew at BFG.

The fried chicken on fried rice is easily one of the top 5 dishes I've had in Las Vegas.  It's exactly what it sounds like, served with a small cup of sweet & sour sauce on the side.  I've uploaded a pic of it and you can see how massive it is.  Probably a good 3-4 cups of fried rice and 2 large pieces of excellent quality chicken, and just for $7.  It's also really good reheated, provided you throw the chicken in a pan to get the right level of crispiness.  

I've also had a pork panang, and once again asked for it as hot as possible and even said \"way above 10\".  After the meal I asked the server and she said she had actually given me an 8 or 9, which I felt was more like a 5 or 6.  Meh, we'll get there one of these days.

I had my first Thai iced tea here and it was awesome.  Can't really compare it to any other place, but as someone who pretty much only likes sickeningly sweet southern iced tea, that should give you an idea where I'm coming from.  Even as picky of an eater as I am, there's so much I want to try on the menu and I plan on probably going back a dozen or more times in the next month for sure."}
{"text":"Beef noodle combination, excellent! Waiter service can be a little better but, food is great! Orange chicken is light, crispy breaded."}
{"text":"When it comes to Thai food, I found both Archis or a place like Pan Asian to be superior. Actually, even the Thai Style Noodle House in Chinatown somehow sports better tasting food and portion size. That being said, they do offer low prices and a good selection. But my Pad Thai wasn't very tasty at all. Too bad, as this place is literally a 1 minute drive away for me."}
{"text":"What I know about Thai food could scare the bejeebers out of my Midwestern Grandmother, but no one in this town would be fooled for even a moment. 

Walking into the Thai Style Noodle House, I knew I was about to sacrifice one of my favorite things about the \"new dining experience\". That is, I love asking the server to make recommendations, you can learn a lot about a place from this simple question. But I know from experience that Chinatown servers are not into recommendations, at least not to a 'pale-white farm boy', other than boring, ordinary, tasteless, \"American Style\" dishes that are sure not to offend any taste buds. Of course, I always have Yelp to guide me to something on the menu that is likely to please.

As I expected, when I ordered the Noodle House Tom Yum Noodle Soup (fat noodles with a 7 on the spice range), I got a series of questions from the server, all apparently designed to discourage me from my order: \"It's sour.\" she says. \"Sure you want soup?\" she asks, \"That's very hot.\" came her final plea, with a combined look of confusion and compassion (the later to be served after diner).

The fat noodles were a perfect compliment to the hot and sour soup and a 7 on the spice level sat just perfect with me. A great big thank you to the Yelpers out there, who provided the ammunition I needed to complete my order without the assistance (or even approval) of the server. Don't get me wrong, she did a splendid job and was very attentive to my water glass (Misty and I are simpatico on this matter), she just looked frightened that I would have a coronary and she'd have to cover my tab out of her tips.

There is a sister restaurant out in my neck of the woods that I will be making regular visits to as I learn more about this Thai food craze everyone's going on about - :). 

I figure I got a good ten years left before I have fully traversed the culinary landscape that is Chinatown alone, so many wonderful new flavors for the tongue. The Noodle House is definitely going to become one of my new standards, even if they never stop looking terrified of my menu selctions."}
{"text":"Looking for a different place while shopping in Chinatown and I was right next to this little hole in the wall. A small place with not many seats available and we were lucky to get the last table. Undecided I ordered the pas se ew. It was a perfect amount for dinner. Very flavorful and the used Chinese broccoli that tasted like Italian broccoli, which had a bitter taste, I liked it! I also got to enjoy the crab Rangoon. Very creamy and plenty of filling in the fried wonton. So many good looking dishes on the tables next to us, I can't wait to go back to attack this menu!"}
{"text":"You get bang for you buck here! Service was nice, food filled you up REAL QUICK, and the Thai Tea here is excellent highly recommend. However I gotta say the spicy-ness level is CUHRAZY. I was having trouble at level 2 (I have low tolerance though) but overall a very good experience!"}
{"text":"Flying in from SFO, we were in the mood for some Thai food, so we hit up TSNH.

It was packed when we got there, but luckily, a two top was just leaving. Perfect timing cause we were hella hungry!

Here's what we ordered:

Papaya Salad-Crisp, refreshing, and well balanced
Pad See Ew-okay, nothing spectacular
Chicken Panang Curry-delicious with a nice heat to it
Sticky Rice with Coconut Ice Cream- good, but I prefer Thai Grill's version

Overall, a good first visit, and we'll definitely be back!....ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the papaya salad (Lao style) and it was soooo good. Better than the Lao restaurants here in Orange County! We also had the boat noodle (beef broth soup) which was excellent as well. The chicken lahb & fried salmon weren't that great but overall this is a restaurant we would def visit again when we visit LV. Hole in the wall but 5 dishes rang up just shy of 40 bucks."}
{"text":"Thai style noodle house is my absolute go-to place. 
It is clean, affordable, and has tasty food.

 My favorites: 
- crab rangoon 
-  crispy noodle with wonton 
- chicken fried rice (for a healthier alternative I sub it with brown rice) 

I have never been dissatisfied with this place!"}
{"text":"I just had to put down the chopsticks, dump my $10 Mongolian beef in the trash and leave a review. 

I've been here before... Had a very decent papaya salad that time and was craving Mongolian beef today. So badly. Tender, juicy, saucy beef. I ordered with extra veggies and no rice. 

What I got was the TOUGHEST chunks of old beef and 2 pieces of small broccoli plus a ton of onions. I guess those are my \"extra veggies\" instead of rice. The beef is so disgusting and old. It tasted OLD and it is extremely chewy. 

I cannot believe that this is ok to sell to people. This kind of beef cut is intended for long, 12 hr stews, not flash fry. 

I will never waste money here again. I've been fed old, cheap and gross tasting meat. Please mail my $10. Thank you.

I am having issues with adding photos."}
{"text":"Super Authentic noodle soup. We went there on the off chance as we just moved here and dint really know whats good. This place was awesome. Satay was moist and tasty. The Mrs got the combo beef soup and i got the thai noodle combo.  They were both packed with flavor. Noodles were good if not slightly overcooked but all in sll it reminded me of being in Bangkok. Try it!"}
{"text":"So you walk in the restaurant & a female worker kinda calls out with \"for here or to go\", not hello or anything that resembles a greeting to welcome you to their establishment.   The customer service tonight was almost non - existing, except for the male worker who at least checked on us & seemed more personable. Thank goodness the food was good."}
{"text":"I have had this place bookmarked for my last three trip to Vegas and I finally got here.  It is hard to find in the dark, even harder to park as it is on the street at the end of an industrial complex.  It is right across to the East from Chinatown Mall which also has parking problems during prime eating hours.

My initial attraction to this place was from reviews by a few of my friends.  When I checked in I was impressed to find Misti, the Vegas CM, is the Duchess of this place.

I chose a Thai iced tea to drink.  Even in my limited experience it was only OK but not great.  It got better from there.  As an appetizer I ordered shrimp rolls ($5.95) which were 6 large shrimp in a roll and deep fried with a peanut sauce.  For my entree I chose Rad-na with chicken.  It was very good but I feel I cheated myself of some flavor by ordering it mild rather than 3 or 4 on the spice scale.

It is definitely a hole in the wall with basic decor.  The service was really great and the two young women were on top of their game while still being able to kid around with the regulars, it is a very comfortable place to visit.   While I was there both a sit down customer and a take out customer mentioned they had driven past the second location to go there because they did not like the food there as well.  I am sure by the comments that they are trying very hard to make them indistinguishable,

I very much enjoyed my dinner here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is good & it's ridiculously cheap. Plus it's not too far from the house ANDDD they deliver. So bonus points for that haha"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. It's definitely a hole in the wall spot, but a must visit when you're in Vegas. It's a nice little family joint off the strip in Chinatown. 

I get salmon chu-chee off the specials. It's fucking amazing. I usually like trying new things especially if I haven't been to a place too often but this is one of those comfort foods that I have to get whenever I'm in town. The papaya salad is amazing as well. Their spice level is... Thai. Their \"5\" is an American \"10\" which means their spices are double compared to ours. 

Didn't have a problem with this place other than that the place is tiny and the kitchen is pretty much in the dining area. So it's kinda loud if you get seated near the kitchen (you can hear the pots and pans rattling as well as the dishes being cleaned) but that's just the venue. You can tell the workers are just trying to make an honest living. I don't know if this is owned by a single family but it definitely gives off a comfortable, \"homey\" environment. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my parents while on vacation in Vegas. This was the best Thai food I've ever had. My dad got the red curry with beef, I got chicken pad Thai, and my mom got the sukiyaki. Everything was delicious, but just a warning that the sukiyaki and the curry are VERY spicy! They are not for the faint of heart. Their Thai iced tea was also very good; every Thai restaurant makes it differently and I like the flavor of this one. The only reason that this restaurant gets 4 stars instead of 5 is how small the restaurant is. It was packed when we got there (it's very popular) so we had to wait outside for 20 minutes. I know that the wait is up to the customers eating there, but it was very hot outside. If you come outside of the lunch or dinner rush, I'm sure you will not have to wait."}
{"text":"Quick and easy review. 2 pick lunch special is amazing. The food is good. Food for the price is amazing. Still working on the dessert list so expect an update in the future. Small location but is currently expanding into the suite next door, so will be able to seat more soon. Thai Style is a good solid place to enjoy some Thai Food, and is located in a great location within the smith shopping center!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty close to my home and so good! My husband and I always get the chicken yellow curry with with the pot sticker appetizer or the crab rangoon app to go and it's all very tasty. You can't beat the price either!"}
{"text":"This place is solid for a quick Thai treat...it's not the BEST Thai food on the planet or anything, but if you want good Thai food at a great price, look no further than here.  I've had their red, yellow, panang curries...chicken satay and crab Rangoon...I always feel like it was good and the portions are large so you don't feel like you didn't get enough food.  I didn't particularly like the pad Thai, but I go to Lotus of Siam if I want the best pad Thai.  The convenient location of this place along with the good quality food at a value price makes it a great lunch spot or if you are struggling to find dinner after a hard day.  Service is always spot on and if they don't answer the phone just call back...they are busy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, reasonable price and great atmosphere.  I love these \"hole in the wall\" places. I will definately go back next time I am in Vegas. I recommend any of the fried rice choices. And the yellow curry can be as spicey as you like it."}
{"text":"The portions are humongous!! Two people can definitely share one lunch combo. Its such a great place to go for lunch, its really affordable, has great options, and huge portions. The vegetarian menu is fairly extensive. I've tried (and liked) the green curry, eggplant tofu, and pad-kee mao.  Definitely a great place to enjoy a lot of good food."}
{"text":"Oh Man this place is amazing.

I was alittle skeptical about this place because it was called Thai Noodle house but they serve all sorts of curries and regular dishes as well. 

Highly recommend
Duck Fried Rice
Any of the Salmon Curry dishes in the Chef's specials section. 

we tried 4 dishes plus dessert and were blown away by the amount of flavor this place packed. would love to go again."}
{"text":"If your looking for Authentic Pho do not enter this place. I was very unhappy with the taste on the food here I ordered shrimp noodle soup and it taste like water I even tried fixing it with lemon soy sauce and nothing helped I left very disappointed"}
{"text":"Pretty good hole in a wall restaurant. Nicely decorated inside Price is inexpensive and foods are tasty. Service was good as well.  Good value restaurant. There is only 10 tables inside of restaurant."}
{"text":"Man this place is the Biz. It's smaller than the other locations, but it makes it feel like home style cooking. I love getting the spicy string beans with red curry dish. You can never go wrong with the yellow curry either.  End your meal with their mango sticky rice and you're gold. Also as an added bonus, they have a vegan/vegetarian menu as well. 

I will post pictures of dishes next time. The food is always to good to remember to take pictures."}
{"text":"Thai Style Noodle House definitely has a hole in the wall vibe.  We had NH style pot stickers and Panang Avocado with both Shrimp and Salmon.  Pot stickers were different from other Asian-style pot stickers I've had.  The taste and texture was very similar to fusion style pot sticker you get at an American bar.  The sauce was good though - sweet, salty, creamy and spicy all at once.  Panang Avocado was more enjoyable.  I'm usually not a fan of coconut milk but the curry was very good.  It was creamy but not heavy, rich yet also refreshing - lemongrass and kaffir lime aromas definitely came though. 

Service was warm and friendly."}
{"text":"What an awesome service order me Tom Yum soup best taste I do recommend a place to anyone I'm believable love it. Great service"}
{"text":"The dining area was clean, but very small.

The wait staff was prompt and helpful.

Over all the food was good, but it was very crowded. I do like Thai food, but I do not care for small spaces, just not my thing."}
{"text":"I'm mixed on this place for a few reasons, but thought to round up based on the reason of coming here: for the food.

So on a Saturday night, we were craving Thai food in the area. It seems every place needs a reservation, even a Thai restaurant. The one down the street, I could understand as it was an \"upscale\" version of one. This place, however, seemed to be a mom and pop place that was like any other noodle houses from the LA area I am used to. Just to be sure, I called to see if they needed reservations. The lady on the phone, who spoke non-fluent English, claim I need a reservation for 2 kids and 2 adults. I had a feeling this was yet another place pulling my leg with the \"need reservations on a Saturday night.\" And yes, it was one of those spots that lied.

We showed up 10 minutes after I called... to an empty noodle house other than 3 tables occupied. Just as I thought: another place claiming you needed reservations. What was a bit of an insult in addition to that notion was the fact that this place has zero customer service! No hello, no smile, no glance. We stood there for close to 5 minutes until a staff finally said they would be with us. Ok...

Again, the place was rather empty at 6pm-ish on a Saturday, with the exception of hearing a grumbling waitress telling us to order quickly as they're backlogged on orders mainly due to deliveries. So now it's slowly making sense!

Anywho, why were we here--to grub!!!! I will say this: the food here is delicious enough that the non-existent customer service can be waived. We tried the pat see ew and pineapple fried rice: basic Thai food that can easily be botched due to catering to the \"American\" taste buds and not actual Thai. Is this actual Thai? To a point. I can tell from the seasoning that Chinese spices such as Maggi sauce seasoning and Chinese 5-spices powder were used on both of the dishes...but it made the food good! So good that the 2 adults scarfed down every piece of food on our plates. And it was not because we waited around 40 minutes after we ordered to finally eat (hey, they did give us a heads up).

Food: good
Price: even better for the food!
Customer Service: subpar

Overall, I would give this place another shot if I happen to be in the area. I just hope that blowing off customers own the phone claiming they need reservations when it wasn't the case does not deter you from eating at this tiny joint!"}
{"text":"Yum. Cheap, Asian food off the Strip. I had no idea Vegas had a Chinatown but I'm glad I found it."}
{"text":"Good food but horrible service. At the time I went the minimum for card was $15. At the other location I was short like 17 cents & they took my card anyway, saving me the hassle & money in buying another drink item. Here the lady was very rude about it to me & my friends. When I tried to explain to her that I'm only a few cents short of the minimum & that the other location certainly could still do the transaction even with my situation, she just ignored me or said nonono. The Thai tea that time tasted horrible & I usually like the Thai tea there. I dunno what was with that lady but I just thought it was dumb how they refuse to do the transaction when noodle house 2 gladly told me that it was fine. I still love the food here but will be going to Noodle house 2. The location is better & staff is more nicer."}
{"text":"Awesome food and super cheap with most dishes being under $7 and still very generous portions.  I've had the Pad See-eu and Khua Kai noodles and both were awesome, though not that spicy even though I asked for a Level 7 on the spiciness.  Level 7 spicy at Pan Asian just about burned my mouth off.  Still 5 stars though, will be one of my favorite lunch spots."}
{"text":"It was pretty good, but it wasn't spicy at all. It needed a bit more seasoning and the chicken, beef, shrimp they all tasted the same it was hard to differentiate with was which since they all tasted the same. Definitely love the Thai tea though!"}
{"text":"Yelp led me here and I am pleased. Portions are like they say -- ample! Excellent value and great flavor. We had Pad Thai with chicken and Yellow Curry with chicken. My boyfriend and I like it spicy (heh) so we got levels 5 and 7, respectively. The spice didn't overtake the flavor and I love me some coconut.

Not too oily, good quality ingredients. Quick service (we called ahead for take out). Would like to return and dine-in perhaps, storefront was cute with a few diners enjoying their own meals."}
{"text":"Love this little gem. Try the Pad Thai, beef salad and Thai iced tea. Friendly staff. Decent prices for what you pay for."}
{"text":"here today and for the first time in over 5 yrs I've been dining here that I was told I could not bring outside drink in which happens to be my kids bottle water. So instead of giving me a heads up for the next time. She ( server) pretty much told me that the owner does not want the drink in her store and that it would need to be taken outside immediately. Which pretty much made it easy for me to just get up and leave the store and never will I return to this location. 
What a bummer for them. I already know how hard it is to get customers in to my business let alone kicking them out because of a bottle water  they brought and was never warned before . 
Oh well they just lost $50 bucks I was gonna spend today plus my future $100's of dollars."}
{"text":"I have heard many great things about this place so I definitely had to find out for myself! It is a small restaurant but I love small restaurants! The food definitely tasted authentic and the pad Thai was on point! We also had green curry which had a lot of flavor in it as well! And I loved how cheap it was I definitely consider this to be my favorite Thai place in vegas now!"}
{"text":"This hole in the wall restaurant is hard to locate, but it's worth checking out. There is other locations throughout Las Vegas, but my family and I prefer this location. It's really small inside with seating for 2 dozen people at a time. Depending what day and time of the week you visit there will be a wait time. 

Service is pretty much good and have been consistent especially how busy they can get. However, the food here is really good and the price point makes this place a good value for authentic Thai food in the vicinity. Some of the dishes that I personally love is the Panang Curry, coconut based curry sauce with a spicy and tangy taste paired well with rice. Another dish worth mentioning is the Pad See Ew, soy sauce based with flat rice noodles with the option of your choice of protein. On cold nights, their Tom Yum soup with seafood is spot on delicious and flavorful with your choice of noodles. 

Pro-Tip, many of the dishes are for individual serving but you can opt to have a la carte for a more sizable and family style portion to share in your group. Overall, a great place to have homestyle Thai food in the Chinatown area!

2018 Yelp Review #30"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam was an impossible wait. This was the next best thing on Yelp so we gave it a try and sure enough, it was a hit! We had to wait 0 minutes and the food was legit. The pad thai was my favorite. Usually I prefer pad see ewe but this pad thai was good. I got the pot stickers since that's what everyone on yelp recommended. They weren't too special. The tom ka soup was good as well."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service was not good at all. I asked for a lemon and they gave me a rind with nothing on it. The curry was really good. It even made up for the fact that they blatantly ignored my empty glass my whole meal."}
{"text":"This is in my opinion one of the most authentic Thai restaurant in Vegas. If you are a native Thai you will love many of the noodle dishes and entres. My favorite items are the pot sticker with sweet teriyaki sauce and mayoaynays. Another one of my favorite is the Chinese broccoli with crispy pork. I give this a four star because they have limited tables due to the fact that their food is so good they are often full."}
{"text":"We went there last week. Everything was delicious. We tried yentafo, hoi tod, and pork salad. The server was very nice. they have great price too"}
{"text":"Great restaurant , food was great and authentic .. i definitely was very surprised and happy ."}
{"text":"Well. I dont know what to say... except this is the shittiest customer service ever. It's so unbelievable how RUDE the staff is. No greeting. Then they huff and puff when you read the menu. Then huff and puff when you are ordering not in their speed. A customer asked when her soup is ready... they huffed and puffed and told her to just wait. Wow. If they huff and puff any more, they might as well audition for the Three Little Pigs broadway show. Oh before I forget, I asked for a menu and the lady said \"it's right there!\" and pointed with her lips. What. The. The food better be good cus this is so not worth the trip. People eating in the dining area just sad or upset. We end up to-go'ing or I will snap at these a-holes. I will be back to add more review after we try the food.

Im back to give a food review. Well. It's good. The cook definitely knows what he's doing. Kudos to him! He earned the extra 2 stars. The only way I would come back is if we have the food to-go. Otherwise, just go to Pin Kaow down the street. Now, they have great customer service and delicious food. I just thought to try something new and this place just disappointed us."}
{"text":"Went here for my co-worker's farewell dinner and just wow. They have great service (my food came 10 ish minutes after ordering) , all the waiters are super funny and kind and the food is delicious. The price is pretty good too. There's nothing on the menu that is above ten dollars. The Pad Thai, Fried Chicken over Fried Rice and the Duck Soup are some of my favorites. And the best part? They have fried ice cream! Not those crappy fried ice cream dipped in cereal, but ones they actually fried. Will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"tom. yum. noodle. soup. HOLLA! it was soooo good and totally hit the spot on a cold, windy day. i'll be back for sure to try the other stuff. =)"}
{"text":"#33 Tom yum noodle soup w ground pork, fish cakes n balls, pork... U get to choose the noodles!

Nobody has the broth on point like these guys, it's got that zing....zang...booom.  The flavors are a smorgasbord of sweet,sour,savory, goodness... the lunch rice combos are also good but the tom yum is the star here...!

Forgive the ambiance as this is your typical asian spot, not much on decor but more attention to the food galore....

Kapoonkap!"}
{"text":"NOM NOM. I sure love this place!! I try and make a visit here every time I am in town. Not only is it a great value, it is DELICIOUS!

1. Pad Thai
Exactly what you'd expect... a plate full of delicious tangy, sweet and sour noodles (spiciness to your liking, of course) with an abundance of chicken, bean sprouts, and of course, FLAVOR!

2. Tom Ka Khai (Coconut sour soup)
Definitely recommended if you're... ya know. hung over. Really great flavor and very comforting.

3. Fried chicken slices over fried rice
Oh my gawd. I know my friend chicken, and this fried chicken was breaded and fried to perfection. I was SUPER full when I took my first bite of this, and I simply could not stop.

Whether you're a local or a tourist like me, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"For every Lotus of Siam that caters to the tourists, there needs to be a Thai Style Noodle House for the locals to hit up. When I'm craving Thai, I go to this hole-in-the-wall tucked away in Chinatown Plaza. There's never a line and the food comes out expeditiously. There's actually four locations in Vegas and they even deliver. The menu has your basic curries, noodles, and rice dishes along with some chef's specials. Their Thai noodle soup is unique and the large chicken or seafood Tom Yum can serve even as an entree. Best of all, most, if not, all of their dishes are around $6-8, making for a much more affordable meal than Lotus. My one complaint from my last visit was their mango sweet sticky rice, which was less than par. The waitress warned me that the mango wasn't ripe and sweet quite yet, but the problem was with the very under cooked sticky rice. In any case, can't hate too much for a take-out restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here with my hubby while visiting Vegas. We wanted a note homey meal than just a buffet. We loved it! I ordered Pad See Eu and it was delicious, the fried tofu on it was perfect. He ordered pineapple fried rice with chicken. It was very flavorful and the chicken was especially fresh and tender. We'll definitely be coming back here when we're in Vegas again."}
{"text":"This location is a lot smaller than the other locations in Vegas. It feels a bit a crowded when you walk in. The service here isn't attentive and my server didn't come back to our table once, and did not checked on us and refill our water. Maybe it's also one server bringing out the food to everyone? I ordered a Tom Yum Seafood Combination noodle soup and it wasn't what I expected. They added way too many tomatoes in the soup, it was very sour, the mushrooms aren't fresh and it was just not the best I've had. I don't think I'll be back at this location."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and dont come in expecting to get any meat in your dishes and you wont be disappointed.
Went in for lunch with hubby today and staff was so abrupt that we decided to get the  food to go. Wait staff acted busy, but no one was there. The girl who took our order was acting like i was wasting her time. No need to have to tell someone off when you  can get the food and go.
Ordered fried wontons, chicken  fried rice,  and bbq pork over rice. RIP OFF!!!! Please see my pics of this crap.... you have been warned.
Wontons were burnt so burnt they are only good  for scratching itchy gums.  No meat in them but they cost 7 bucks???
Chicken fried rice was decent, the was about a tablespoon of chicken in the whole dish. But the rice was okay... so you get one star
Bbq pork was flavorless and tough, real tough almost like jerky but bigger and more expensive. 
I came here because the reviews were decent but now im thinking folks in this area are just used to settling for what they can get. 
I wont be back, wouldn't recommend and will steer folks  away from..."}
{"text":"Inexpensive. Small. Friendly.

The pot stickers, papaya salad, noodles with shrimp, fried rice with pork, yellow curry with chicken were all wonderful. Not as ambitious, nor as expensive, as Lotus, but very worthwhile.

No alcohol so you might want to bring some wine, but make it a big, rich one to counter the spice. 

I was with a friend who lived in Thailand for awhile and he said it reminded him of a lot of the great little joints in Bangkok."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go whenever I'm in Las Vegas. Keep your buffets on the Strip, this little unpretentious place makes the best Thai food I've ever eaten. The Noodle House Tom Yum noodle soup is amazing, as is the duck fried rice. I don't know anywhere else in Vegas you can get 4 entrees for under 35 bucks."}
{"text":"Continuing our quest to find good, cheap Asian food off the Strip, we headed to our next stop ... Thai Style Noodle House! We originally were headed to Palms for their buffet, but since it was Father's Day and a Sunday, they only offered a pricy brunch at $22.99 each. Thus, Thai food it was.

Location: Turn on Wynn and look out for the \"Noodle House\" sign. Parking is located along all the other strip mall restaurants on the main road. The inside of the restaurant is very small; you can see all the tables once you walk into the place. Luckily, we arrived a little before the lunch rush, at 11:30, so we only had to wait 10 minutes for a table for 5. The two servers were excellent at clearing tables and getting people seated, so turnaround was very quick.

Food: We decided to order family style, so we shared the #41 shrimp pad thai, #42 pad see ew w/ chicken, thai fried rice w/ shrimp, #4 special deep fried snapper w/ ginger. The noodle dishes came out in a short amount of time, and they were fantastic! I particularly liked the pad see eww with the delicious flat noodles and the tasty sauce. The snapper was part of a sauce dish (not just deep fried and on a plate like we expected), but it was also delicious, as was the other two dishes. For drinks, we got a thai iced tea, which was a cool treat on a hot 111 degree Las Vegas day!

Best part, the bill came out to only $35 for everything (not including tip). What a steal! 

Quality, authentic food, quick service, and very affordable prices. Well- deserved five stars and our favorite meal during our trip! We look forward to coming back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"I've been on a Thai binge. Definition of Thai binge.. if you go without Thai for more than three days you get a hangry haaaaangry Queennie. 

I liked that this place used Chinese broccoli and not broccoli broccoli in their pad see ewe. And I loved the prices for their portion sizes. 

Their service was great. And that's honestly all this hungry thai filled girl needs in a restaurant. 
Short and sweet, great food at good prices with great service! 

Defs will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I love pad Thai so we went looking for a new place as I love eating at different restaurants. We stumbled upon this little family owned place off of lake mead and rampart - thanks to Yelp. They get a 10 for value price. Most plates start at $6.95 and average at about $8.00. 
Good food quality and presentation I give a solid 9. I had the combination pad Thai and we shared a yummy serving of chicken red curry. My daughter had the Mongolian beef. All plates came extremely hot and fresh. Just the way I love it. Simply but clean presentation. Definitely one of my top 10 places to eat great Thai food."}
{"text":"Small local Thai restaurant with great food.The customer serVice is Amazing for such a small busy place. We were greeted right away and our food came out fast and hot. I Got the drunken noodles and even my picky eater son loved it! The Thai tea is good too!"}
{"text":"This is my most frequently visited place.  Everything on the menu is great but I usully stick to the pork and fishball soup noodles.  Whenever I'm craving for something quick, filling, and satisfying. I head to Thai Noodle!"}
{"text":"I was here last week with my girlfriend from reading the reviews in yelp! Have to tell you the food is great with respectable price as well. The menu has illustrated photos on which entrées you would like to choose from. Very clean restaurant. I will be here again soon. Btw, the yellow curry w/chicken is crazy Delicious!!"}
{"text":"I love this place I can eat here every day
I always get Mongolian beef or chicken pad thai spicy level three. It's never failed me.
Every other restaurant that has been at this location has failed to last. This one has been here for many years now, so it has proven itself. They actually not only survived, but they expanded into the spot next door. The decor is beautiful, customer service is always good, and food excellent and fast."}
{"text":"This place is 4.5* to me but I'll bump them up just cuz they were so nice. Good food, plentiful portions, and a reasonable cost. Friendly staff checked in on us multiple times to see if we needed anything else and even taught my friend a word in Thai. Will definitely been using their free delivery soon. My only complaint is that they need to stay open later!"}
{"text":"Best thai place in town. I would highly recommend Tom Ka, red curry and pad thai. I went to Nattayas and it was good but twice as expensive."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very cute and clean looking. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the pineapple fried rice since that is my Thai go-to dish I use to compare restaurants. It was good- the chili sauce was amazing. I will definitely be coming back and exploring more of the menu here!"}
{"text":"For a hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant, there was an automatic 18% tip charge on top for a party of 4.
This was completely out of the blue. No where on the menu was there a note for automatic tip charge.  When we brought it up, the waitress said it was due to the holidays. (This was on 12/27/17) Once again, was not informed before hand.  Heard one of the staff say that auto tip for 3 or more, not confirmed either.  Got removed after in the end at least, so we could leave our own tip. 

For an auto 18% tip, the service wasn't even that great, only ok.  Only two water came out after asking twice for water. Two waters : 4 people, that ratio seems a tad off.  Anyhoo, again, only 2 spoons came out during dessert, had to ask again so everyone on table had one. 

Food was ok and reasonably priced. Ordered the basil fried rice, but it didn't have basil (hmm).  Really love the shrimp pad Thai though, very authentic!

Overall experience was ok, the tip issues at the end just left a bad feeling leaving the restaurant from a fairly fulfilling dinner."}
{"text":"I've been at the number 2 and this one is better by a lot. The deco feels like expensive but everyone was so relaxed that it felt good. The Panang Avocado with salmon was ok. Im not into \"gravy\" kind curry but lots of avocado and chunks of salmon it was great for the price. My wife had red duck curry and it was really good with the pineapple bits. Bistro kind of place and not expensive at all."}
{"text":"Amazing food for super cheap with great service! One of my favorite thai places in Las Vegas for sure"}
{"text":"Loved it!!! My favorite was the Panang shrimp with avocado. So creamy, flavorful, and just had the right amount of spice to keep your mouth watering for more. It was so good with white rice  I highly recommend the duck fried rice and the Pad Thai as well. So yummy! The place is clean and has a modern decor. Price wise, decently affordable. Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"I came here for drunken noodles. They were very delicious. I give them a three stars for the service.

I like my food very spicy. The waitress for some reason thought that was funny. After telling her I wanted them at a 7 out of 10, she giggled for a while, asked me if I was sure a bunch of times, and then giggled and then went back to the kitchen and told the chef a whole bunch of stuff in thai that I don't understand, probably something along the lines of \"heeheehee she asked for spicy! Make it super spicy!\" Kinda rude...

Anyways, when my food came out, it was super spicy, but I enjoyed it a lot. She took it upon herself to check on me every 5 seconds to see how I was doing.

That kinda pissed me off.

But the food was good!"}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer of this little Thai restaurant for the past two years. I never got tired of this place. Everything they make taste delicious and people who work there are much nicer than most of the Asian restaurant in Vegas. 

I usually go there and have their #38. I don't know the name because I eat it so much the people there start making it right away when I enter the door. My second favorite dish would be their beef noodle soup with flat noodles. It's a normal dish but it's amazing. I also liked their Fried rice with duck and vegetable soup (with or without noddle) if i feel like something light or if i have cold.

The place is a bit small for a group that's over 4 people, but who cares, this place is amazing. 

btw, they just renovated the restaurant a few month ago. It looks the same to me but I appreciate the effort@!! ha"}
{"text":"Off the beaten path and a hole in the wall place this was excellent.  The ambiance was nothing to jump joy about but it is a hole in the wall place like I said.   The service was excellent.   The Tom Ka Gai soup was a little watery for my taste but was delicious.  The pad see ew pork and chicken curry were excellent as well.  The price was cheaper than most thai food places.  Definitely a good value!  I will go back again to this restaurant and recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"The noodle house is a very small place but the food is excellent. Best Thai food ever !!!"}
{"text":"OMG. We are from out of town, southern California to be exact. We live close to a bunch of southeast Asian communities and I have to say this is one of the best Thai places I've been to. I ordered the Duck Noodle soup, papya salad mild, and spicy basil fried rice at spicy level 9. I am very particular about my noodle broth because I own and make my own noodle soup at my restaurant and it's really one of the best I've had. The papaya salad was nice and sour and the spicy fried rice was delish. If you haven't tried this little gem please do so, I highly recommend. And the prices are sooooo reasonable for the quality of food!"}
{"text":"I needed some good food before attending 4 plays at the Las Vegas Fringe Festival at Las Vegas Little Theatre in the same area as Thai Style Noodle House.  It was a no brainer as this was a place I was going to try when I got to it.  Yesterday was that time.

I got a regular iced tea and I ordered the Thai spice noodles--spice level 6.  Since I didn't know how they interpret their 1 - 10 scale, I thought I'd go lower and add additional heat if needed.  

The service was very good.  In about 5 minutes, I had my plate of pan fried noodles made with vegetables and chicken.  Their 6 is more equivalent to 8 at other places so I chose wisely.  My server brought me the 4 jars common to Thai places in case in needed to spice it up a bit.

The noodles were very good.  It was a filling meal.  For less than $10, I had dinner and my iced tea.  The place was quiet on this Saturday afternoon.  There was one larger family group and two women at another table."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Rio and yelp this place for lunch. The place holds about 20/22 people so prepared to wait at peak time. Food was really good the price was reasonable. I would definitely go back to this place"}
{"text":"We come here a couple times a week.. The food is delicious but inconsistent. The staff is NOT accommodating.. Even for regulars. Sometimes Victor from the Tropicana location is there helping out and he is great.. But most of the staff is rude. The last couple of times we've been in, it has been inconsistent.  We always order the soup..and last time we were shorted on broth.. They made up an excuse that they were changing the portions.. However, today it was back to being the normal portion.. I found a long, curly HAIR in my soup and not only did they charge me for the entire thing (minus a measly 10% for the inconvenience ) but they didn't even offer to remake it for me! I feel that they should have taken care of us..but there wasn't even an apology! We asked to speak to a manager but there were none on duty.. (Apparently, there is never a manager on duty! Who knows what else they do to the food?!)
When we told our server that we weren't satisfied with our experience, she was rude, unaccommodating and uncaring. We told her we won't be back and that they just lost some good clients to which she said 
\"Ok.\""}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!! Prices are awesome as well.  They have huge portion sizing and the flavor of food is great.  My favorite is the pad see u and the red chicken curry.  They have great delivery if you live close or within 3 miles. Service is excellent everytime we visit.  Give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"We ordered from uber eats bc we were in the mood for good Thai. 

This was gross and they got our order wrong."}
{"text":"Great price. Good service. Nice portions and  delicious Thai food in southwest area. 

This location is nice and cleaned with beautiful color purple and grey interior. Feel so classy! 

I have been coming to this location about 3-4 times so far but never had a chance to write about them. 

There were only 2 servers during my dinner visit (around 6:30-7pm) and their phone kept ringing for to go ordered non stop but they made it through! 

As soon as I placed my order. I noticed a large amount of to go ordering about 10-15 boxes on their counter and I thought to myself... Oh \"O\"! 

I have to say.. They did a great job! My cup of water still filled, more napkins coming  and they still got time to checking on our table and other guests.  

Bathroom was cleaned and all equipped! What else I could asking for!?? I'm not a picky yelper anyway. 

Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"For the price you pay, actually is worth every penny you spend. Home style thai cooking, simple and delish.
Remind you, street food vendor in Bangkok"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, food wise. The food seemed authentic casual Thai food. The place is a little bit shabby. The pretty waitress almost wanted to give me attitude; however, the not as pretty waitress was nice. When we asked for some extra bowls, I got bowls. When we asked for chopsticks, I got chopsticks. It wasn't like 5 star service or anything, but I still tipped  very nicely because everyone I was with enjoyed the food and the experience."}
{"text":"HIdden MF'ing gem in Las Vegas.  If you have a car or are not afraid to venture off the strip for some cheap, good eats, this is the spot to go!

It was a lenten friday on our vacation, so we were on the search for some seafood.  We didn't feel like paying $30 for a buffet or eating some fried fish sandwich from a fast food joint, so one of us came up with the great idea to have some Thai food.  Yelp to the rescue!

We were about a mile from this place, and a 4.5 star average?  We can't lose.  And we definitely did not.  We started off by sharing the seafood tom yum soup, which was delicious.  It had shrimps, mussels, squid, and fish balls.  We ordered it medium, but would have definitely been ok with mild, as we were all dripping in sweat by the time we took our 2nd and 3rd bites.  For my entree, I went with the green curry with shrimp.  I wish there was more shrimp, but the food itself was very well prepared and tasted great.  

Other entrees on my table were pad thai, 5 spiced (?) salmon, and some other fried red curry salmon.  It was meat-less friday remember?  haha  All of us had nothing but positives to say about our dishes.  And, all the dishes were less than $10.  Score!

The service here is excellent as well.  Seeing our sweat soaked faces, the waitresses were quick to refill our waters and even put the fan next to us.  Lol.  I have never been anywhere that would actually do that for you.  haha

Parking is a bit weird here.  I did not see a parking lot, except for the one across the street, so we had to play frogger in Las Vegas chinatown, which was another adventure in itself.  

Overall, food is excellent and I will be back."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Visited few times already and will definitely come back. My favorite Thai food place.

ATMOSPHERE
I remember when I first moved to Vegas, this place was an Hawaiian plate lunch place. It was a bright and welcoming place. Now it looks completely different; modern and clean. I just love walking in here.

SERVICE
Better than other restaurants I've been to. Servers here are helpful and very fast. I'm always impressed because there are usually only 2 servers but they provide fast and great service to each and every single customers.

FOOD
Their menu is a bit overwhelming because there are so many choices! If you don't know what to order from here, I recommend:
-Beef combination noodle (love the soup! you can choose the type of noodles. Egg noodle is my favorite)
-Ginger snapper (LOTS of vegetables)
-Orange chicken (always fresh and crispy!)
Food is usually served within 10-15 mins.

CONCLUSION
I have been to many Thai food places but this is my favorite one out of all because of their fast service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Just beware of green chillies :) 
Papaya salad was yummy and spicy :)
Coconut soup was yum
Spicy noodle great
Eggplant was Avg
Pineapple shrimp curry was excellent
Thai tea and coffee was great

Great food for great price"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to come to China Town for lunch so we started Yelping some four star places and Thai Style Noodle House came up.  

Located in a strip mall it's not a big place but it was crowded, small and cramped-but we were seated and greeted right away.  

I ordered a Thai Iced Tea and it was made to perfection, cold and creamy without being warm or watery like other places.  

We ordered an appetizer and had the fried shrimp and it was good.  A few pieces of battered shrimp perfect for the two of us.

I had a terrible cold and was in much need of a bowl of chicken noodle soup, thank goodness they had one on the menu.  A hot huge bowl with rice noodles, cilantro, chicken and broth came out. Waitress brought out some spices to add so I put in a few chili flakes.  My friend had a beef noodle bowl and she said it was very good. She was very happy with her order.

Overall it was ok, speedy, friendly service and convenient to the foot spa which we went to afterwards.

Lots of great noodle bowl choices on the menu."}
{"text":"A small spot but dynamite tasting food.  It may be hard to find because there are no parking spots directly in front of the store like much of the shops in the area so keep your eyes peeled.  This is located on Spring Mtn and Wynn on the south east side so don't miss it!

But my latest I had the thai ice tea and the salmon curry which was a special on the board.  I really enjoyed it and would recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I gave this Thai Noodle House another try because it has now become my favorite take-out!

A sore throat brought me in yearning for something warm and comforting to sooth it.

I ordered the sliced beef Thai noodle soup bowl with wide noodles and the hubby ordered the mixed beef with ramen noodles.  

I would advise the sliced beef if you're ordering this dish. The mixed beef has some mushroom looking cuts that resemble liver so for me the sliced beef was the winner. 

I got it to-go.  However, if you stay in and dine.  Check your good table manners at the door and forget everything your momma taught you because this delicious slurpable broth with loads of flavor, crunchy fresh bamboo shoots and bok choy nesting on top will leave you slurping and licking your bowl dry while begging for more. That is if you can finish it-because the serving is PLENTY for TWO.

My secret:  Add some lime to the broth it will add and enhance the flavor.

Go get your noodle soup now!"}
{"text":"Just as good as the Thai Style Noodle House #1, and even better than Thai Style Noodle House #2!  

The only other Thai restaurant within close proximity is Nattaya's and this one to me beats her out.  We're presented with good Thai food at a lower cost than the one across the street.  Compared to all three locations this one is the nicest with the most upgrade in furniture. 

My favorites are still the specials on the board, especially the salmon that I first tried on Spring Mountain.  I've had the Roasted Duck Fried Rice, Roasted Duck Noodle Soup, Roasted Duck Curry, and if they had a Roasted Duck Ice Cream I'd probably be all over that.  But I like eating in rather than taking out or having them delivered because I like to use the spice, sauce, vinegar that's delivered to your table.  The food is greasy but so good, I've also had the Chicken Satays that comes with the peanut butter sauce which was good and I like to judge a place by their Chicken Satay and sauce."}
{"text":"A two star rating I was not expecting to give based on all the great reviews, but a two star rating is what they're getting.

I had no qualms about the service.  We were seated right away (5).  They checked in often and our cups never went empty.  

So, the two stars is strictly for the food.  What we had:

- pot stickers - The sauce (mayo mix and something else) was sweet.  I'm not a girl that like sweet sauces on her pot stickers.  I like a little tang to it.
- beef noodle soup - I thought this had a bit of a sweet flavoring to it as well.  It was merely ok.
- duck fried rice with pineapples - ok
- pork fried rice with Chinese sausage - I've never had Chinese sausage before so I wasn't expecting the sweetness.
- chopped chicken w/sticky rice and papaya salad - rice was hard and papaya salad's fish sauce was a little too much for me
- chicken satay on a stick - ok

I'm not a girl that likes her meats or soups sweet.  So, forgive me if these dishes are supposed to be that way.  This place wasn't my cup of tea.

My husband completely disagrees.  He loved it here...but he can write his own damn review.  ;)"}
{"text":"Great little place for some good Thai food!

Located on N. Rampart in the Smith's shopping center, Thai Style is located on a near corner of a lot.  Go slow or you might miss it because the place is tiny.  Really, there might be just over a dozen tables available for dining in.  But that's ok because Thai Style has no problems with doing take-out for you.  If you do dine in though don't worry, the place is nicely appointed!  New tables, chairs, paint.  Good ambiance, especially when it's quiet.  I hear during lunch is when the crowd is probably the biggest.

Came here with the wifey for a quiet dinner one night after we heard their second location opened up here near our side of town.  Really felt like the place was our own, there were only two other tables taken nearby, and on the counter was multiple orders ready for pickup.

The menu at Thai Style is fairly authentic feeling, with some dishes looking like they may have got a bit of an American touch.  We stuck with what we were hoping was simple and basic, but had a lot of flavor.

I love noodles, but really wasn't feeling Pad Thai.  We instead opted for the Pad See-Eu - stir-fried thick flat rice noodles (almost like chow fun) with egg and Chinese broccoli, all in a sweet dark soy sauce.  This was delicious.  The rice noodles with the sweet soy sauce was heavenly, and was given good texture with the addition of the Chinese broccoli.  It makes perfect leftovers, great midnight snack in front of the TV while watching Breaking Bad reruns!

We also had the Fried Chicken over Fried Rice - marinated, fried chicken breasts over a bed of Thai Jasmine fried rice.  This was good as well.  I would have liked the chicken to be a bit more flavorful, and a bit of a thicker piece.  However, it was yummy with the Thai fried rice which had egg, garlic, onion, salt, and pepper.  The rice was seasoned easily but just right.  And the portion was huge, more than enough for two people to share.

We got out of Thai Style with full bellies and some leftover change.  The bill was not bad at all, our total for two entrees, tax, and tip was under $19.  That was a plus!  We will be back to try other dishes, I really am interested in their red and yellow curries.

Thai Style runs some amazing lunch specials too, for short of $7 you can get a choice of TWO (yep, two) entrée options from a pretty big list, and each lunch special comes with soup, rice, and an egg roll.  Don't want two entrees?  Do just one, and pay less than $6!  Dealio."}
{"text":"I really don't know how this restaurant got a 4-star overall rating - this is some of the worst Thai food I have ever had. I've lived in Thailand and have had Thai food all over the world, and hands down this is some of the worst. The shrimp in our tom yum tasted spoiled (super   mushy, crumbled in my mouth - I had to spit it out). The seafood fried rice lacked flavor, and the chicken pad kaprow was dry. The only thing that was decent was the Thai iced tea. The inexpensive prices at this restaurant aren't worth it - there are plenty of other better places in Vegas."}
{"text":"My go to Thai place when I'm craving that yummy Thai food at home. You can't beat the pricing at this place!! I love how everything tastes. My favorite is the tom yum and the pineapple fried rice. The portion of everything is pretty big! Whenever I have went there is never a wait. The flavor is always consistent. The service is nice. They also do takeout if you're within two miles of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I stumbled upon it and I am so happy I did. I have visited this place a couple different times and every time the food is very good and fresh and the service is quick. 

Gluten Free: They do not have a gf menu, but they are very accommodating. They are happy to make any of the fried rice dishes without soy sauce and are also able to make changes to some dishes to make them gf. I have never gotten sick from eating here. Very impressed with this place and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for good, cheap Thai. I first learned Thai(dining, that is) in lower east side NYC, so I laugh at most $ Thai joints in Vegas... then I leave and come here. 

Desserts and all noodle dishes is far are all fabulous; dumplings are to-doe for; spice noodles; flat noodles; tom kha is delish--not funky or old like most places in Vegas.  

I have yet to try duck here; the papaya salad was too skimpy and boring the one time I tried it. 

It gets super-crowded around dinner time on weekends."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed this place.. 

I'll try to fit in all I can muster about my favorite China Town area restaurant.

My mom's Thai and a really good home cook. But since we're all grown now, she doesn't make huge family style meals anymore. So. This is my go to Thai restaurant.


It's not fancy, it's not over priced, it's not a new take on Thai. It's pretty much the classics done simply and executed well. Plus the price is definitely right. I'm pretty sure nothing is over $10..I think.. Well..  maybe! If you do seafood it might be.

My favorites are definitely the same as most yelpers:

Noodle house style pot stickers are always a good start.

Noodle house Tom yum soup with choice of noodles which I get the fat noodles- spice a 10.

My favorites include: Roasted duck curry 75% of the time, duck Fried rice(ask for chili in it and it makes it even better), the roasted duck soup with egg noodles, fried chicken over fried rice, BBQ park and Chinese sausage fried rice, lad nah, grilled beef salad with a side of sticky rice, their version of pho lol, Tom kah kai, and pretty much everything on their menu.

It's all really good.

My only let down was the pork wonton soup I got tonight with egg noodles. Fresh, but a  pretty bland broth.

A huge plus is they can make their papaya salad LAOS style, which I prefer, and it's actually really good :] 

With Ling Ling as the best server ever and down to the padak on the table as a condiment, this place is pretty authentic and never disappoints me. 

Idk if this is for regulars but the service is always super sweet. If I don't finish something for ANY reason I.e. Being full or saving for later.. The Ling Ling always asks if i enjoyed it or if I need it replaced if I may not have liked it. So nice :]

It's tiny so expect a tiny wait at times, the food is worth it, and try not to sit in that center table when it's sunny..

Random thought:

My favorite thing about eating a Thai meal is that it's usually family style. I wish they had an options of ordering a bowl or pot of some of the dishes.. If that makes any sense :] but I'm sure there's a reason they dont offer that. Limited table space..?"}
{"text":"This place was packed and stayed packed during our visit. They are understaffed so don't expect much on \"service\". Noodles are healthy and delicious. Pricing is very reasonable."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for... very bad service, average food. Thai green curry with vegetable more spicy than tasteful. $7.85 . When I walk in, I have been seat at a dirty table. Not very enjoyable waitress who forget to smile, draining her feet  and drop your plate on the table like \"eat that\" of course when you pay cash, there is no ticket coming back."}
{"text":"Special thanks to that Thai Thread posted a while ago.  I was on a special quest for Thai food then and came here twice during lunch just because I love love love (that's 3) their Spicy Basil with Chicken!  A bit hole in the wall place and very affordable. 

Not a big fan of their Tom Kha (coconut soup), Pad See Ew (dry version of Chinese Chow Fun noodles), and Salmon with Chu Che (curry).  They're just OK.  But it was the Spicy Basil w/ Chicken that took the spot light and gave me no hesitation to come back for seconds when a friend suggested Thai food.

Service is cool, and it seems like they have their regulars there often, so this place is proper!

*note* Spicy Thai Basil lvl 5 out of 10 gave me a good sweat even though I thought i could handle spicy.  Darn those little hidden peppers for putting me on the spot in front of my lunch date!"}
{"text":"I don't want to share the fact that I go here every chance I get, but how can I not share the fact that the food is good, cheap and you get a lot for your money.  I used to go to their Chinatown location, then started going to the Fort Apache location and now that there is one literally 5 mins from my house, it just makes it too easy to order for pick up or dine in.

So far, I've shared this restaurant with all my coworkers and they all LOVE this place.  Everyone's favorite (including myself) has been the duck noodle soup, I get mine with egg noodles and add wonton.  For a year or two, it was the ONLY dish I would order...I would look over the menu and tell myself I was going to try something else but always went back to the duck noodle soup..crazy right?  Well one day, I saw a Vietnamese family all order the same thing at the table next to us.  I asked the waiter what they were eating and discovered Rad Na...so I started ordering Rad Na for a while.  It was delicious!  Flat rice noodles with Chinese broccoli and your chose of meat in a yummy gravy..my mouth is watering just thinking about it!

Gradually I've worked through the menu, it was been at least 5 years since I've discovered Thai Style Noodle House and I have to say my current crush and my go to lately is their Pad See Eew and their Spicy Eggplant with rice, but the must have with any rice dish (you can find it on their sides menu) is their egg omelette with pork.

Are they the BEST in Vegas? No if you take into account Lotus of Siam, BUT, they are great if you don't want to spend an arm and a leg. AND if you know me, you know I LOVE noodles and they are the only place in Vegas if you want delicious Thai boat noodle soups!!"}
{"text":"The red curry was awesome. The service was great and our food didn't take long to come. I really enjoyed the atmosphere as well. The art on the wall is beautiful. Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai cuisine. They actually ask you how spicy you want your food, which is typical in real Thai cuisine. Panang curry was awesome. Pad thai is great. Enough wetness to give you  a chance to savor the flavors as it slides down your taste buds....oh back to the food, yes it great. Noodles are not dry, but moist with flavor. 
Thats how i like it...wapapppp!(slap sound). Truly an gem. I been coming here for the last few years when i go to Vegas. I always make sure that i drop by and hit that thai.........food that it. Yes it was a happy ending. (No perv pun intended).... stop reading and get your ass to Thai Style Noodle House ..... you tummy will be happy you did."}
{"text":"I love thai food!  I'll miss this place.  I've eaten here almost every day during my stay.  Prices are great, favors are addictive and the atmosphere and service are friendly and casual.  A must try!"}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is a great value for the amount of food you receive. Food comes out fast and taste great"}
{"text":"I'm picky and this place past the test. My favorite is steamed tofu curry. The staff is friendly, professional and patient when I cannot decide what to order."}
{"text":"Beautiful spacious restaurant. I usually go to the Fort Apache location. We ordered my usual, chicken pad thai and shrimp tom yum soup. My friend wanted to try duck fried rice. Everything is too salty here. The fried rice was too dark (as if the chef accidentally poured an entire bottle of extra dark soy sauce in the rice). Usually the color of fried rice is nice and pretty but the entire dish was one color...dark brown. 

I ordered the mango sticky rice to share. Was good, but you can't mess that one up. 

I'll probably stick to the Fort Apache location, the food there is much better and not just salty."}
{"text":"Service was poor and the food was horrible. They don't use fresh ingredients and I think there were about two pieces of chicken in my chicken pad thai, and they appeared to be re-hydrated chicken"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials, their curry is fantastic and the mango n rice... mmmmmm

They are friendly, orders are always consistent and correct, food is awesome."}
{"text":"First time trying this place!  Hit the spot!  Wanted authentic Thai noodle, this was great!  Seafood, chicken chopped, pork, fish balls, fish cake...  DELISH!!!"}
{"text":"chicken chow mien was amazing...soo good that i has to save some 4 l8r"}
{"text":"Behold, the long-awaited revisit! Alas, no photos because I didn't foresee this meal even happening and because of subpar battery management earlier in the day...

I enjoyed a late dinner at Thai Style Noodle House tonight with a group of 7. We actually had a ~10 minute wait, which turned out to be a good omen (as it usually is). We ate family-style and were keen on trying a lot of different dishes, including the mythical duck fried rice that my friend had recommended. Unfortunately, they had ran out of duck, which was quite disappointing at the time. After making some substitutions, we got to work on the meal.

Pad thai w/ shrimp ($7.95): it's pretty similar to every other good pad thai that I've had. It's savory and sweet. There are a lot of bean sprouts on the side.

Pad see-eu w/ combination meat ($8.95): as good as any pad see-eu (spelling variations included), with a few different meats that were all tasty, and a nice Chinese broccoli.

Three flavor grill salmon ($8.95): I haven't seen this before, but it's surprisingly good. There's also ground meat and shrimp with this, and it's largely savory. It's served with rice to help soak up all the great sauce.

BBQ pork & Chinese sausages fried rice ($7.25): another delicious order. Heavily Chinese-influenced, especially in the featured meats.

Tom yum soup w/ seafood ($7.95): not as sour as some versions that I've had, which I appreciate. Various seafood items, mushroom, tomatoes, and veggies fill the bowl. It is possibly a feat for one person even at a moderately sour level, but it is definitely a treat for a group to share.

Panang curry w/ chicken ($6.95): despite being ordered as a 3, it seemed more like a 4 or 5 to me. Maybe the inclusion of the spicy peppers did it. It's a rich curry that's maybe just a tad salty, but the rice helped to moderate that flavor.

I really couldn't find any fault with the food, and the service was solid too. The only real annoyance (aside from the 86'd duck) tonight was the smell of dishwashing. I probably sat the closest to the back area, and it was a bit annoying. Luckily, it went away before our food arrived, but it could've been worse.

There might be another hot Thai restaurant around the corner (almost literally), but Thai Style Noodle House hit the spot for me and my group. As I said before, I'll be back for that duck fried rice, and hopefully my phone won't be dead that time!"}
{"text":"How do you say \"Wow\" in Thai.  Wow.  While my friends got the highly recommended duck fried rice and the house special noodles, I ordered the pad thai.  I know, typical, but most people will agree that's how you can judge the average from the great Thai restaurants.  And it was awesome.  And the duck fried rice was so good, it was almost deserving of a take-out order for the road back to LA.  All I gotta say is \"Only suckas eat on the strip\" after this."}
{"text":"Worth stoping by and trying it out.

I've dined here quite a few times as I have found it to be good quality Thai food that doesn't take to long to get served.

Noodle house has a few other restaurants in town that have been successful. So I guess it made sense to open in this part of town.

Always try the duck fried rice. It's one of my favorite dishes here with noodle house classic pot stickers to boot!

I will say the delivery a couple of times has takin quite a while and sometimes cold when received. Also calling up to order for pick up or delivery has been hard to get through.

I do believe though going in a sitting down for a meal here you won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai Restaurant in Las Vegas. It's a hidden little restaurant by chinatown. I ordered the House Special Tom Yum Noodle dish for lunch along with the Papaya salad. 

I also ordered to go the Duck Fried Rice, Pad See Ewe and even Pad Thai (which is not my fav Thai dish) and all three were amazing.

Price wasn't even expensive. Under $8.00 dishes. I love it!"}
{"text":"Service isn't always the best, but the food is fantastic!
The papaya salad there is so refreshing and so tasteful. I also love the vegetable tum yum soup and the pad-thai. I also like that their hot tea is a mix of green and chai tea.
The best part is that it's inexpensive. 
Love this place !!"}
{"text":"This is my go to Thai restaurant that consistently serves up tasty dishes.  Noodle House is tucked away and can be a little hard to find.  It's on the side of the complex away from Spring Mountain Road and on Wynn Road by the Hawaiian Style Poke establishment.  I've eaten at their other locations, but for some reason I think this is the best one.  The place itself is very small with enough seating for about 30-40 people and that's pushing it.  Surprisingly though I've never had to wait too long to be seated here.  Service is always fast and efficient too.    
 
I have ordered the: yellow curry, panang curry, pineapple fried rice, papaya salad, and chicken & shrimp silver noodle dishes and all of them have been great.  They also serve up a strong and tasty Thai tea too.  However, I think their stand out dish is their pad thai!  The portion size of the dish is extremely generous and I like how they have the pad thai and bean sprouts separate so you can control how much bean sprouts go in.  They also ask you on a scale of 1-10 how spicy you want your dish, which I appreciate as well.  No matter how many other Thai restaurants I try in the valley I will always come back to this one!"}
{"text":"Delicious take-out Thai food. Pad Thai was okay... But really enjoyed the fried rice with Chinese sausage and pork. The Panang Beef sauce was delish!!!

Also get the chicken basil. Makes a perfect pairing with Pad Thai and steamed rice drizzle with Panang curry sauce. That's how you eat Thai food folks!

35 bucks = 3 dishes and comfortably fed four people."}
{"text":"TRY THIS PLACE!
I've tried quite a few ramen houses, thai shops and chinese food hole-in-the-wall establishments in Chinatown, and I have to say this is DEFINITELY one of my favorites. Heres why:

- Tom Yum - the best frickin tom yum I have EVER had.
- Pad Thai - was delish
- Curry - traditional and new wave selections, and very good!
- Thai Iced Tea - not only is it very good, but they offer an XL size for the inner fat kid.
- Price - SPOT ON. Where I would normally spend $30-40 on the same meal (my girlfriend and I always get the same items the first time we try a new place), this place cost $23. This allowed me to tip the waitress with more than what she deserved. Everyone is happy :)
-The 'ramen' (it was not called ramen here) was also very good, the broths are savory and the meat included is perfect for the amount of soup/noodle/veggie.

The choices are interesting: duck, salmon, many different traditional thai dishes and flavors prove that a one time dining experience will leave you craving the sequel."}
{"text":"Came in right before 12:00 noon which was a good thing. This place is super small but busy. It does'nt take a lot of patrons to fill this place up.

My order the beef combo soup with meatballs and bok choy - flavor was yummy on a chilly day and the portion was decent too.  

Looking forward to coming back and checking out some of the other dishes.
BTW $15.00 mimumun for credit cards so it your going solo - bring cash."}
{"text":"This was out first time coming here. It was horrible experience. We entered the restaurant and the server said \"wait\".  After we were seated, she dropped the menus on the table and walked away. I was in shock the way we're were being treated. Then I noticed a male in the kitchen eating while prepping food. Then the server came over and asked if we wanted something to drink. We said no as we were talking about leaving. She walked away and rolled her eyes. We walked out with out ordering. I will never return here."}
{"text":"My go to Thai place! Inexpensive compared to other Thai restaurants and food is always fresh and flavorful. Love the papaya salad and seafood pad see ew."}
{"text":"Average Thai food with very poor service.The attitude of the two waitress was extremely rude.Have been to better Thai restaurants and will not be back to this one."}
{"text":"You HAVE to try this place!!

So sooo good! Pot stickers are a must!

Maybe it's because it was sorta cold and windy plus we were very tired from dancing all night, but their food was outstanding! Plus, I was among good friends/company and we ate a la family style. So, I guess my review is a bit biased due to other factors.

I dunno - food was delish and warm. Kind of like a warm, nurturing hug after wild nights tearing up Vegas. Such greatness."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place over the summer by a local. It instantly became a favorite of mine as well. I absolutely love the 19 which if my memory serves me correctly is the coconut soup. The blend of herbs, spices and coconut is amazing. I have eaten here twice. Both time I got the soups and shared with a friend. As well tried several of their Thai dishes. I haven't eaten anything here I wouldn't order again. All the food is freshly prepared and tasty. To bad I don't live in Vegas because not only is the place tasty. The portions are huge and the prices are nice. I will be making this one of my must stops anytime I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Don't know what happened, but the taste has really changed here. I usually go to the one on Trop but used to come to this location in the past. I went today for a quick lunch and got spicy eggplant that was mostly bland and gravy with so much oil, I just paid and left it uneaten. I'm not going back. They said they had a new chef and offered to fix it, but i didn't trust it would get better. Too bad, it used to be a good place. Maybe their other dishes are still good but I won't find out."}
{"text":"I am really starting to like Thai Style Noodle House.  I have never been disappointed with the food and service last night was top notch.  I was talked into trying the chicken pot stickers and I am glad it happened.  They were awesome.  For a place that serves food relatively quickly and at a good price I was not expecting an appetizer dish to look so appealing.  6 dumplings lined up and topped with two sauces, soy and some sort of seasoned mayonaise.  Add to that green onions and sesame seeds and what a nice treat to add to my main entree order of pad see-eu.  That was good too.  I had a craving for flat rice noodles and this hit the spot.   You better believe I will be back many more times."}
{"text":"This was the BEST thai we've ever had, i mean there's TONS of thai restaurants in nyc but none like this.  Prices rock, large portions AND everything was super tasty and delicious!  You really can't go wrong here.

We were brought here by Thai friends who were in town from LA and now knowing there's LA spots that are even tastier than this blows my mind.  Everything was so good and this is at the top of the list for our next Vegas visit (whenever that'll be).  So GOOD!!

*Duck pad thai: this looked yummy when it arrived and was even better than it looked!! how is it that just in look it was more authentic than any other pad thai i've ever had?! So much flavor and a LOT of duck.  So GOOD!
*Pad See Ew: fiance loves this dish so he wanted to try it here.  WIN! he LOVED it!  he's a big eater and yet there was still leftovers, insane!
*Cant remember the name of this dish...It was Hoy something...Mussel and seafood pancake: this thing was ENORMOUS!! we almost ordered 2 since the pic didnt look that big but we figured we'll get 1 and just try it out first.  It came out and wow, HUGE!  Crispy outside, doughy goodness inside with lots of mussels and seafood.  This was a hit with our entire table.  Absolutely worth the guilt of eating something fried that's this big, but mmmm DELICIOUS.
*friend got the grilled pork with spicy papaya salad and rice on the side.  Forget the name of that too but dish was very flavorful.  The pork reminded me of the chargrilled viet style pork and the papaya salad had an awesome spicy kick.  YUM!

We are definitely coming back here and we've already recommended it to family and friends. :)"}
{"text":"We were here for lunch & went back for lunch the next day. Very authentic Thai food. Noodles are very good. We got the seafood wonton noodle soup & beef noodle soup. Broths was out of this world, delicious!! The portions are huge, they did not skimp on the ingredients. The three companion which includes sticky rice, BBQ chicken & the Laos style papaya salad was amazing. Service was ok. We will definitely be back for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Me and my husband come here pretty often but we've been very disappointed with our food recently. They messed up our order not just once but 3 times! The first time was when we ordered PORK thai hot basil! We said pork!! And they gave us beef! Second time, we ordered the fried chicken over fried rice, we even repeated it to the server a couple of times and even showed her the picture of the food! And she still gave us the wrong order! She gave us the thai fried rice! And when we told her thats not what we ordered, we wanted the FRIED CHICKEN OVER FRIED RICE, she said they would have to charge us additional 4 dollars! Really??? So since we were really hungry, we agreed anyway... And guess what?! She gave us tiny pieces of grilled chicken! We were very upset! Messed up twice with one order! Didn't even have appetite to eat anymore. Totally not worth it!"}
{"text":"This place has good thai food, though it is a little low on the spice index for my tastes (but I like my food only a little less hot than the temperature of the sun, lol).

The most outstanding part of the experience was my server Kitty. She was wonderful and quick to bring me my dish. She also made great suggestions for house dishes such as the House Tom Yum soup. 

I know I will keep coming back just to be served by her. If you come, I suggest trying to get her!"}
{"text":"I'm Thai, and this restaurant is one of my favorite in Las Vegas. Very good quality and not pricy, I got the Tom Yum noodles with 7 stars spicy. It came with a huge bowl and only $6.95!!! Can't beat that! The food came out fast and the service was great. Worth the 5 stars."}
{"text":"I used to love this place dearly. Unfortunately the last couple times I have gone the service has been lackluster and the staff has been rude. If you ask for something as simple as veggies added to a dish they charge a few dollars extra and throw in a couple onions slices and a stem of broccoli. The food just tastes like they use off-cuts in everything and cheaper recipes for their dishes now. There's more spice than flavor. It just seems like they've really tried to cut the costs and it's at the customers expense. Like I said I've given it a couple tries after the first bad time and it hasn't improved at all. I wish it wasn't true but this place has gone downhill a lot."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  I love their papaya salad and pad Thai.  Highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for 4 days, we ate here 3 days in a row, that's how good this place is. Thai servers, Thai cooks, the food is authentic, the variety is amazing, price is right. This is my new favorite spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love it here , the food that is. The service is a bit eh. Every time I come there seems to be an issue. The only reason I come back is for the food. I'm giving them a 3.5. Amazing food but not the best Service. I have witnessed gossip , no service due to staff eating , confused about my dietary restricting. Their pad see ew is my favorite, their broccoli is so fresh!"}
{"text":"The food was good and fast. The place is clean and the staff was great. Plenty of seating. 
The food all looks great and tastes good."}
{"text":"This is one of the only Thai places on the NW side of town, and thankfully it's very good.  Had it for the first time tonight and tried the green curry, chicken satay, chicken pad thai, tom kha soup, and mango rice.  Everything was great- it's traditional Thai comfort food. 

We ordered it for pickup, it was ready on time, and the restaurant was nice and clean. They did mix up the spice levels, and made my curry very spicy when I only wanted a spice level 1.  The to-go mango rice seemed pretty small as well.  Staff was friendly.  Pin Kaow is better, but if you're in Summerlin this place will do!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding. The Thai tea wasn't great. Don't think they are using coconut milk. Something just seemed off. Service was attentive. the place is small, and parking for the area is challenging around lunch time. \"Secret\" - Park across the street (on Wynn) from restaurant. This made it so much easier. Careful on how much spice (hotness) you order. Their scale is 1 to 10, and I'm always careful when trying new places. I ordered Mongolian chicken with a hotness of 4 and it had a nice sting. Couple next to me was each enjoying a LARGE bowl of soup and it looked awesome. Looked like Pho with huge pieces of meat and veggies. I'm sure I would enjoy everything on their menu and look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Thai restaurant. Authentic Thai dishes without costing an arm and a leg thus making this hole-in-the-wall joint one of Las Vegas's best kept secret. But judging from the number of people starting to flock at this place, I guess the secret is out. Me and wifey have our usual favorites of panang avocado shrimp (lots of plump juicy shrimp, by the way) or salmon, mixed pad thai and chicken satays. We always opt for the higher spiciness rating just because we both love spicy food."}
{"text":"This little gem is my favorite Thai place! The staff is super friendly, and always helpful with anything I ask for. 
A cozy atmosphere; this place is good for one, two or small groups of 8-10. They serve many different Thai dishes and the following are some of my favorites:
Papaya Salad
Silver Noodle Salad
Pad Thai
Both the Red and Green Curry
Duck Fried Rice
Three Companion Pork
Tom Ka- chicken
Tom Yum 

This far everything I've ordered from this place is delicious AND full of
Flavor. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for good Thai and great prices!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks fellow Yelpers for sending me to this place... yummy Thai take out was achieved!

This is a total dive, but fine for take out, and close to the Wynn and the Trump, just a five minute drive off the strip.

I had the papaya salad, and it was spicy, sweet and crunchy, with roasted peanuts on top.  Then I had the beef Pad See Ew, which was decent.

One tip for folks looking for looking for something different, this place is located in a strip mall that is crammed with Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai and Korean restaurant.  Just drive down to that area, and there are lots of interesting places to check out."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place ! 
It is one of those types of places that even if you go everyday , there is something new to try . And even after you've tried everything on the menu , you can get alittle creative an combine foods ! YUM ! Pad Thai mixed in with Tum yum soup is so delicious . The prices here make everything 10X better ! Always always exceeds my expectations . I will continue to go here for years to come !"}
{"text":"3/5/11
Considering how disappointed we were with Lotus of Siam last time in Vegas the bf was wary of trying Thai again until we found Thai Style Noodle House! We tried the thai style noodle with beef which is their pad kee mow...and the beef combo noodle soup...

Super crowded and cozy...the service was good but there was a slight wait for food obviously...the beef combo noodle soup was very interesting... not sure I'd try it again because it wasn't spicy at all! LOL 

One of the better tasting Thai places in Vegas..."}
{"text":"I have lived in Vegas for close to 3 years, this was my first time. I was really surprised when I came in unexpectedly  and saw everyone earing these homey looking bowls of hearty soup. Me and my girlfriend immediatly sat down and started skimming through the menu. Rigt away we drafted the Roasted duck soup with the EGG noodle. Such a tasty non modernized cooking style. Really enjoyed the quick stop. Great job noodle house keep it up."}
{"text":"I love Tom Yum Noodle Soup. Before I discovered this little gem, I thought Lotus of Siam had the best. But now I find Thai Style Noodle House is even better and a lot cheaper. Plus they let you choose among 4 types of noodles, including flat, thin, vermicelli and egg. How awesome is that? This place was so good, I came 2 days in a row, the second alone. I wish I had known about this place when I was still living in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant to eat here just because it's such a random spot for a noodle house to be in, right next to my smith's? But good thing the bf did his research on yelp when i was craving yummy soup!

This place was packed Friday night,I didn't expect this place to look so nice, it was an actual sit in restaurant that's nicely decorated.

 it's a small place but the food was GREAT! prices were great too! it was 6.95 for a bowl of Beef Stew Noodle soup and it was a pretty big bowl and couldn't even finish it! Their soup was very flavorful without being too powerful. 
We also tried their Pad see ew and the Chicken Panang curry. The pad see ew was not the best but it was still pretty good, and the chicken panang was okay. I'll be back to try their other Thai dishes and Soups.
DEFINITELY try their soups b/c the Soup alone earned this place the 4 stars:) 

One down side, there's no restroom in this restaurant so i had to hold it..
actually 2 down sides, the table got a little crowded for me and my boyfriend but i guess that's our fault for ordering too much! 

TRY it! 

plus the servers were really nice."}
{"text":"So I've been going to this place for the last maybe around 5-6 years. The food is wonderful. My experiences here have always been great. The food itself always reminds me of food my mother makes and it's great to a place that isn't too costly and gives great sized portions. 

Anyway, on October 15, 2016 I went to the establishment with my girlfriend, her father and her little brother for dinner. 

The food was wonderful as always, but toward the end of our meal I had ordered a to-go order of Pad See Ew and Chicken Larb at 7:45pm. 

Right before I put in that order a party of 9 had just arrived arrived. I ordered my food before they even sat down. 

At 8:05pm I ask the lady how much longer for my food, and she had said it's on its way. 

8:15am comes around and I ask her again, and while walking away from me she says \"it's coming\" 

To me, I was just wondering why a basic two dish to-go order was already taking up-wards of 30 minutes to come. 

8:20pm comes along and they bring out two items to the party of 9. At that point I had asked the lady one more time and she flat out walked away from me and had not given me an answer. This whole time I was keeping my cool, but at this moment I couldn't take it any longer. 

So I stand up and wait right where the cash register is. And finally at 8:25pm they finally arrive with my food. And she just hands it to me and doesn't say anything like sorry for the wait or have a good night or anything. 

To me it was an absolute pathetic display of costumer service. Waiting 40 minutes for two simple items. Love this place but that left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"The Thai Ice Tea is a bit too sweet for me, but the Thai Style BBQ Pork, papaya salad, and sticky rice, all for $9 was quite a deal.  The BBQ Pork was delicious, papaya salad was just ok.  Overall, I would come back again."}
{"text":"Thai Style Noodle House is consistent all around. Mainstream and pretty authentic. I've been to the location in Chinatown and Fort Apache, but this location (Jones) is my favorite. Very clean, open, modern with good food. 

My go to dishes are: 
Thai noodle soups (beef, combo, roast duck)
Pad Thai 
Spicy Noodles 
Grilled Beef Salad 
Pot Stickers

Service has always been consistent and prices are reasonable. I return often when in town."}
{"text":"The place is small & corner side.. But they have good food!! Everytime go there always busy.. We like to order pad see ew, fried rice rop with fried chicken, red yellow green curry, penang beef, tom yum seafood soup, thai tea!! Should come & try it!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken red curry with a 5 spice, and the beef pad see ew also with a 5 spice and both dishes were absolutely delicious! I've been to many Thai restaurants in town, and this was definitely one of the best! I ordered it for delivery to work and they arrived a little before the promised time. The guy who took my order over the phone and the delivery guy were both super nice and polite!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Best value of any place I've found in Vegas. Food is great, prices are extremely cheap, service has always been good in all the time I've eaten here. All around you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I thought we had a good thing going with this place but after this visit I can say we will definitely not be back. The food is good, but the wait is ridiculous. There is no reason for almost an hour wait between receiving our appetizer and our entrees. Drinks were empty for probably 30 minutes of that time.
This place needs to get their act together with the scheduling. After coming here weekend after weekend experiencing the same issue we can clearly see there's a problem that those who come every once in awhile do not."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent patron at Thai restaurants, this place is pretty good.  The portions of some dishes are too small for the price (some appetizers) however the entrees are well proportioned.  They play modern music here if you're not a fan of traditional Thai music.  I can't say too much on how different it is, being a chain, it's not gonna differ to much from the other Style noodle house I've been to.  This place isn't my favorite but it's not at all bad or not worth visiting for a bite."}
{"text":"Orange chicken was delicious. Super light and crispy with not too much sauce. Very yummy. 

Chicken pad Thai wasn't bad. It was pretty good but not the best I've had. My mom ordered it 5/10 for spice and it was far too spicy for her. I got a 2 and it was just right for me.. I'm a spice wimp. 

Fried wanton appetizer was quite tasty. Extremely crispy on the verge of being a little overcooked, but it was OK.

Service was good. Cup was never empty which is a plus. Its a small place but was enjoyable. I'd go back because the food was great for the prices. Serving sizes were pretty large for the $6-$7 price per dinner plate."}
{"text":"5 stars for bang for your buck and service.  For $7 a dish (and they are large) you get a well cooked and seasoned Thai dish.  The service was excellent, very friendly and the food came out in a good amount of time and hot. 

If you want the glitz of the strip, then go pay some stupid prices for the same quality Thai at the Cosmopolitan.  

This restaurant is a little gem."}
{"text":"I never give bad reviews, but my experience here was just uncalled for. Came in with a group of 4 and the place was packed. We were understanding and waited in line in the 120 degree heat to get seated. Right when we were up next to get seated, a group of 6 walked in the door. Instead of seating us first, the server there decided the group of six was more important than my group and sat them immediately. Keep in mind that group did not have a reservation, nor did anyone of their party came in before us . My group and I stood there in appalled as he sat everyone and completely ignore my party even when we had been standing in front of the waiting line the entire time. We asked why the group that came LAST got seated first, and all the sever could say was that he will take care of us later. He offered no explanation or apology as to why he chose to sit that group first when we have been waiting for 15 min patiently. What kind of BS is that? This is no way to run a business."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices and authentic experience. We experienced no wait at 7:30pm on a Saturday."}
{"text":"So good and so convenient! After walking up and down the Vegas Strip my feet were hurting! This place delivers for a $3 delivery charge so we thought let's do it!

We ordered over the phone and the driver called us when she was leaving to let us know she will be there in 5 minutes. I had to take a picture of how carefully wrapped the food was. The liquids were definitely not going to spill out the way she packaged it all.

We ordered the papaya salad, Beef Larb and combo pad see ew. I liked how you can make anything spicy and they ask you the level of spicyness. The food was so good and they had decent prices. Check them out if you want to order out."}
{"text":"I've done dine-in and to-go several times and haven't had a problem. I noticed they extended their restaurant. I walked in and asked for seating for two. Ended up being seated in the extended portion to be forgotten. The woman who sat me dropped the menus and was long gone and almost 10 mins pass when i decide to walk out. I think it's best for them to turn people away at the door than forget about them in the back."}
{"text":"2stars for the food, it is ok .. They won't make your food or drinks to your specification without giving an attitude. The worst service I have experienced in visiting Las Vegas in 15 years. Never asked how things were once food was delivered. Brought dishes at seperate times. I could go on . I guess they have never heard of Yelp."}
{"text":"Worst $7.85 I've ever spent. it was less than a scoop of chicken and about 3/4 of the to go plate was rice! will DEFINITELY NOT order from here again!"}
{"text":"Omg!! What a gem in Vegas!!!  Authentic Thai Food and totally reasonable price!  Boy, they can really make it spicy too!  It totally reminds me of the Thai food I had in Thailand.  We had Pad Thai, Spicy Noodles, Crab Fried Rice, and Glass Noodle Salad.  I wish I can find a restaurant like this every town I visit on vacation!!!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The servings are generous, the price is affordable, the decor is clean, the servers are nice, and the food is Noms! It's a win, win for Thai food all around. 

I love that they serve papaya salad as a side to some of their meat dishes along with the traditional sticky rice. Not too many places do that, but it's how a lot of Thai's would serve you if you came over to their house for dinner. Legit."}
{"text":"The star of our lunch at Thai Style Noodle House was the Panang Curry with shrimp and avocado $7.95. 

Typically, I prefer green or yellow Thai curry, but the Panang curry is out of sight! The shrimp and avocado are the perfect accompaniment.

We  also ordered yellow curry with pumpkin and chicken and pad Thai with chicken. Although tasty, they don't deserve more than a fleeting mention. 

Will definitely come back and try this place again."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant tucked away off to the side of the busy Chinatown strip mall. Parking is not too difficult for lunch. 

I got the chicken and shrimp silver noodles. On first glance it was obvious that the noodles were a bit unevenly dressed, based on the clearness of some noodles and the dark brown of others, so I was mixing it around myself for a bit to get it a little more even. I also just had two pieces of shrimp - that were both overcooked - but plenty of chicken. The plate was flavorful but extremely greasy. My friend got the Thai Spicy Noodles (probably their equivalent of the pad kee mao) and she said it tasted mostly like the Chinese hot sauce. My other friend did enjoy her pad see ew with pork and they were generous with the pork and veggies."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas for just a night and didn't wanna dine in the strip. I had narrowed it down to a couple of well-reviewed options outside the strip and chose 'Thai Style Noodle House' simply 'cuz I was craving something  spicy and hot. 

This small place seemed unimpressive went I entered in with a fierce waitress yelling out the orders. It was useful that we were handed a vegetarian menu as it just makes ordering so much easier. We ordered Fried string beans with peanut sauce (3 stars out of 5), Tom tum soup (5 on 5), Red curry (4 on 5) and Fried eggplant and tofu plate (5 on 5). At the end of the day, I would definitely recommend this place if you just want GOOD food."}
{"text":"The house potstickers are really delicious. The food was great. The waitress was very friendly. My only complaint was that my daughter's meal didn't come out until 10 min after everyone else's meal. I would definitely come back though."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's a hole in the wall, but the food is really good.  The fried rice was excellent.  My young son loved it.  I love the wonton soup and all their stir-fried noodle.  The portions were generous and the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"You need to try this place at least once.

Cheap and delicious, with arguably the best curry I've ever tasted (and I've been to Thailand). THIS IS THE BRANCH TO GO TO-- DO NOT GO TO THE ONE ON FORT APACHE. While the one on Fort Apache is the same owner, it's not the same chef and the food DOES NOT taste the same. This is the original branch and the cooking is SUPERIOR.

This is a hole in the wall Thai restaurant that's authentic to the point you can see a Thai grandma in the kitchen whipping up your dishes. Everything is so frigging cheap ($5-7 a plate) so I recommend you come with friends so you can eat family style and try a little bit of everything. 

The interior of the restaurant is ghetto, so ghetto that I have to warn people ahead of time and assure them that the food is worth it. This is a place you come strictly for flavor.

Things to order:
Duck curry - slices of duck in a red curry served with a side of white rice. Delicious. Amazing. This dish makes me so sad I live in Los Angeles. The curry is rich and flavorful, the slices of duck are juicy and tender, and it all just melts so well in your mouth. It's a mouthgasm.

The pineapple fried rice- HUGE chunks of pineapple and whatever meat you choose (I like chicken with this dish). It's prepared correctly in that the rice isn't dry. This dish has nuts in it so if you're allergic, beware.

The pad see ew - It's a bit sweeter here than in other places, but I prefer that. I choose beef. Once again, it's done well.

The pad thai - Delicious.

Get my drift? Parking is plentiful, and the service is just fine (cute thai ladies who can't speak English well)

Honestly, just call ahead and pick up your order so you can skip the crowd. You need to try this place. A+++++"}
{"text":"Delicious thai food but the original one on Spring Mountain in Chinatown is better. The go-to order is always:

- Red Duck Curry - spicy (THE BEST!!)
- Pad See Ew with beef- spicy

These two dishes, the red duck curry especially, haven't been done better anywhere else. The red duck curry has huge chunks of duck in a creamy red curry broth with generous pieces of pineapple. Affordable, delicious, and one of my staples when I'm craving thai food."}
{"text":"WOW!  Fantastic Food and great prices.  What more do you need to know?"}
{"text":"Pad Thai for me is a must try on any Thai restaurants. The pad thai here was okay. It wasn't bad but it wasn't the best either. It's does however come with a lot of shrimp. They were not stingy about it like most Thai restaurants. The server was very honest which made us choose another dish and it was bomb! My boyfriend picked it. It some sort of chicken curry and the sauce was just perfect. We also got the crab fried rice. Mhmm"}
{"text":"I really do enjoy the food here but their customer service is sometimes a hit or miss. Some days I am able to get a rice dish as an ala cart, some days I am told I cannot....i also like to get extra meat on my favorite dish (crispy pork w/Chinese broccoli) but sometimes I feel it is a burden to ask when the person on the phone goes \"ughhhh *sigh* lemme ask if I can do that be cause it's extra\" And yes I don't mind paying the $3 something extra meat fee."}
{"text":"My friend and I frequent this little restaurant at least once a month if not every week. I always get the usual shrimp avocado panang and she always BBQ chicken, It never fails us each and every single time. They are the most authentic Thai restaurant in my opinion as far as flavors and ingredients used. I can vouch for this because my parents are Thai and the only food that is cooked at home IS Thai food. The prices are cheap and the service is good. I recommend this spot to anyone who asks where's the best Thai restaurant is in town."}
{"text":"It's been a few years that one of my favorite hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant went out of business (Owner sold and went back to home country).  One of those places that just the owner and his wife working serving really cheap and good authentic dishes.   I've eaten at plenty of Thai places after and this one is tops in value and taste !  
          I'm glad to see this place is getting the recognition it deserves.  The location is hidden, but it goes to show that the location doesn't matter if the food is great.  I've had the Khua Kai rice noodles, crab fried rice, and beef lad nar.  Yummy flavors and good portions.  The service was good to top it off.  
         I've eaten during the busy lunchtime  and have noticed that local Thais eating and picking food up.  They must know something.  
     I try to stop by whenever I go towards Chinatown."}
{"text":"Excellent thai food, fast service at a great price! Really can't go wrong. Only thing that was far from exceptional was the mango in the mango sticky rice dessert. Mango was VERY sour."}
{"text":"Lets start with the positives of the restaurant... Place looks nice. Food was very flavorful! 

However, I was very upset with the fact that I had to wait 45+ minutes for my Thai Yellow Chicken Curry and inconsistency with portion. The table next to me ordered Thai Yellow Chicken Curry and it was delivered to their table within 15 minutes, plus their portion was significantly bigger. My portion was much smaller in comparison. 

Although I acknowledge that they were short on staff, tables wasn't cleaned up after people left. They started cleaning tables based on when new people needed table. Unprofessional practice. 

Lastly, I had to flag down the waiter 5+ times to get my water refilled. It wasn't until the 5th time, the waiter refilled the water cup. 

I will not come back here again."}
{"text":"A great locals eatery. I have been coming here for years, mainly to the Chinatown location, and I appreciate the simplicity of the place, the great food and the reasonable prices. No Maitre D, no fancy ceremonial, just great food. Pad See Ew remains my favorite, Spicy Eggplant is great too, and the soups are amazing! Last but not least, you gotta try the Sticky Rice with ice cream dessert."}
{"text":"My wife is Thai and she likes this place.  Says it is authentic.  it is my second favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas.  I think the best is the Thai Style Noodle House on Fort Apache.  The in both places is really good and affordable.  The difference is the parking and atmosphere.  The parking at Fort Apache is typical strip mall parking while the one in Chinatown is less convenient.  You have to park around the corner and walk.  The one of Fort Apache has more room, is cleaner, and newer.  Also, I love food that is very hot (spicy).  I asked for 7 our of ten and it nearly burned my lips off.  I don't know if that is standard or if they just messed mine up.  Overall, I highly recommend this place.  The food is plentiful, affordable, authentic, and delicious."}
{"text":"I prefer this location to the one on Ft. Apache, simply because the food seems to be more flavorful- but it is a little further away for me
Probably safe to say that this is my favorite place to get thai food in town. I've been able to try larb, pad Thai, pad se ew, spicy noodles, beef soups, and silver noodle salad to name a few. Everything has been simply delicious!! Good place for vegetarians- even the tofu is savory. 
One of the cheaper Thai places. Most dishes run around $7-8 and the portions are great!! Almost enough to share but it's so good you won't want to. If you can't handle spicy food, be careful when ordering (scale of 1-10 spice). 
Customer service is excellent. Fills up full during dinner time. I can't think of anything to complain about :-)"}
{"text":"Hubby & I were looking for good Thai food but we found GREAT Thai food.  We love it!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered Thai Style Noodle House through UberEATS for a quick lunch. 

The menu had all the usual Thai dishes as well as others that seemed more authentic. I liked the selection. Pricing seemed lower than other Thai restaurants I frequent as well. 

Despite all the great sounding dishes I went for Pad Thai with chicken since I was craving it. The Pad Thai was great in flavor, but the noodles were hard like they weren't cooked long enough. It was off-putting. The chicken was in small pieces and there wasn't much of it. The dish was much better as leftovers the next day when the noodles softened in the sauce. 

I ordered salad with peanut sauce, but the restaurant forgot to include the salad in the bag. I did taste the peanut sauce and thought it tasted great. 

Overall, this was the first time a restaurant forgot part of my order and I'd rank the Pad Thai at the bottom of others I've had. I might give them another try when I need a quick lunch and try another dish from the menu."}
{"text":"We were a little hesitant to try this spot because of some of the negative reviews. It was only 2 of us so it probably would have been pretty hard to screw up our meal. Regardless, it was a fantastic experience. My boyfriend and I travel a lot and find ourselves at so many kinds of restaurants in many price ranges. We got a large thai iced tea to drink, roasted duck soup with vermicelli and roasted duck curry. Everything was fantastic and so flavorful. The duck was tender and delicious, the broth was bold and perfect for a fulfilling dinner. My boyfriend ordered his curry (5 in heat) and practically licked the bowl clean. We both thoroughly enjoyed everything and it was all $20! The same meal could have easily been $75-90 on the strip for the similar flavors and quality. The service was also excellent and fast. We ordered, ate and paid in about 35- 40 minutes and the restaurant was full at the time. Can't wait to come back, this restaurant is surely a new favorite. Please try and disregard some previous negative reviews, you'll be missing out by not trying this spot :)"}
{"text":"Good food good service! Great place to go on lunch hour as they have very speedy service. The chicken chicken satay and potstickers are really really good. I liked the pineapple fried rice as well."}
{"text":"I came here after EDC. The Tom Yum soup was Soo delicious. It was perfect even in 100+ weather. It was perfect for after EDC. The spicy Thai noodles wasn't that spicy but then again I have a high threshold for pain. Pad See Ew was delicious but who messes up Pad see ew?!? The only issue i had was with the pad Thai. It was dry and flavorless. Maybe it was a bad day. This place
Is tiny. They only have about 9-10 tables. A great help find."}
{"text":"The staff was nice but the food was so-so.  Nothing in the way of ambience either. I don't plan on coming back. :("}
{"text":"Every trip to Vegas should involve a stop at this place. Buffets are great for dinner or breakfast, but for that other meal of the day or when you are worn out from exclusively eating the priciest food items to recoup buffet cost, this is the place to hit up.

Finding the location is a little tough and parking can be even tougher during noon time, so aim to eat a little off the rush time. The parking lot on that strip is also rather cut throat, so expect some near misses. The seating is also limited so expect to stand outside if you have a large party or during a meal rush. The interior is not lavish by any means, but it seemed to be somewhat upgraded the last time I went. 

Our favorites include the green papaya salad, tom yum soup, duck noodle soup, and any of the noodle dishes. One fun highlight is that noodle dishes can be made with duck meat, which is not a feature you'll find at many other places. The restaurant leery Chinese in-laws manage to down a large quantity of food here, which says a lot. As others have advised, this place takes requests for the food to be spicy seriously. If you are borderline in how much you enjoy mouth burning, go down one level from what you would request at other places for your first visit. 

There are Chinese menu items, but we haven't tried any of them. Really I don't see a need for these items since the Thai is so good, but they might make someone who is Thai averse comfortable eating here. 

As a side tip, for Vegas people on a budget, after eating here walk down the strip and you'll find a bakery to buy Asian style breakfast buns for the next day."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot 
They have a few duck dishes that I was very happy about. I want to try everything on the menu
So I'll definitely try to come back more often"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken pad thai but instead i got some type of chicken spaghetti WTF. The noodles were thin, does not look like pad thai or taste like pad thai. Took one bite and that was it. Pot stickers seemed like they came from frozen bag from the store and damn the fried chicken wings were plain as hell, even i could make plain chicken wings myself, no instructions or recipes needed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant and I have been coming here for years (often multiple times in a week). I really like their yellow curry and the spicy string bean dish. I usually like to start with their potstickers and I haven't met a person who didn't love them after trying them so I definitely recommend. 

The restaurant itself is nothing fancy and pretty small, but it is pretty much always packed and I think that speaks volumes. 

Having been to Thailand the food is very authentic and for a very reasonable price point!

I also like that they now have multiple locations so I can get my fix throughout the valley"}
{"text":"This is definitely more a 4.5 stars,  One of the best Thai restaurants I have been to ever and I live in one of the best foodie cities (San Francisco) in the world! There were 4 of us and 3 companions had the pad thai (different variations from tofu, shrimp and chicken) and all were very good! The noodle Tom Yum soup was also very good.  Came out piping hot  and has the good sweet and sour flavor you expect from a Tom Yum.  I had the chicken thai basil with brown rice and it was very flavorful and good portion size.  At around $6-7 per plate this was a bargain find and cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best find in Vegas, un assuming place but good food to get away from expenssive meals on the strip...the taste, price and location makes it one of my favorite...we found this place from recommendation of local server at one of the casino and this lives up to her description..."}
{"text":"This place is hella bomb! It occupies a small space in that same Asian plaza as Pho Kim Long but on the other side. The food is delicious and the service was surprisingly good for an Asian restaurant, haha. The name of the restaurant is kinda funny because it's SO clear and it might help the drunk bastard tourists jonesing for a Thai.

I ordered Pad See Ew, Tom Kha Khai soup, and my partner got the Pad Thai (the most adventurous and daring choice of them all). You can choose the spice level of your noodles which might be puzzling because it's between 1-10 and a little description of each level would be helpful. The refreshing Tom Kha Khai soup selection was interesting because this tangy potion is typically served in a big silver pot complete with flames but you can also order it by the bowl which I did. 

There's also this interesting mural on their wall that is Vegas-themed. The place is affordable but seating is limited."}
{"text":"TO WHOM IT MAY BE NOT CONCERN,

PLEASE DONT COUNT MY 1 STAR!


I have reported you to food health district of nevada.
The first incident back last year, ordered for delivery it was chicken wings sweet spicy, the worst Chicken wings I've ever had, the strong dead rat smell on that wings makes me throw up. I was very mad wasted money for a piece of s#!t.

On Today 7:20pm - my husband ordered to go pad thai shrimp (oh help me!) there's the smell again the dead rat is back. I took a picture of it the shrimp tail has black and grayish colors. I will never go back to this place again. NEVER.....NEVER...NEVER.....NEVER......NEVAHHHHHH!!!

Sincerely,
VERY DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"Small little mom & pop restaurant; if you're going to come here with a big group then you might have to wait. 

Great place to come after a night of partying & clubbing on the LV strip where you know you're trying to get over a hangover hahaha.. =)

Noodles were very tasty & Yummy...5 stars

Pad keep Mao: Not greasy / oily but yummy 4 stars

Pad Thai so so yummy & tatsty noodles were awesome 5 stars

Papaya Salad yummy & had a spicy kick to it. 4 stars

Thai Tea: yummy & thirst quenching 4 stars

Food: A - (Portions are generous, but to go orders are very small) 

Don't order to go because the portions that they give in their to go orders are so so much smaller than when you sit down & eat inside the restaurant. -1

Service: B-  (can be a bit slow)

Decor: A - (interesting giant mural on the wall for you to check out while you eat) =)"}
{"text":"Awesome food, cheep prices, friendly service how can you go wrong.

I had the Pad Thai and a tofu and broccoli plate, both where great but the tofu and broccoli stood out.

I can agree the ambiance was not quite there, with bright lights and warn out tables/chairs, loud clientele, but I took it to go so it was all good.

It was a little hard to find (and find parking), its across the street from the bigger chinatown mini mall complex you would think to find it in and parking is minimal.

Ill be back!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Pad Thai.  The restaurant itself is not great, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"I can sit here and write an essay about how terrible the service is here but I won't, just because the food is amazingly good. S/O to the people in the back cooking it up."}
{"text":"The first Pad Thai I've tried in Vegas I've actually enjoyed! 

I went with one of my girlfriends and we wanted to fill up on some delicious Thai carbs. We got Pad Thai, Pad See Eu and Thai Spice Noodle. I love spicy food but I know Thai restaurants don't joke about their spice so I ordered mine a spice of 7/10. The spiciness was just right and I was very happy with the Pad Thai. 

The Thai Spice Noodle was good too, however it had a lot of cilantro in it which gave it too much of a herbal taste for me. To be honest, I thought the Pad See Eu was pretty tasteless... I brought it home for my roommate who was starving and we stir fried it over the wok adding in more flavor.

Three noodle dishes were around $22 or so, incredibly affordable! I would definitely return here for the Pad Thai as it is my favorite Thai dish. Absolutely delish!"}
{"text":"It's decent.. I got the pad Thai (beef) and the texture was off. I wasn't super impressed but not disappointed either."}
{"text":"Handing out 5 star ratings after starving for 4 hours in a long drive from Los Angeles is irresponsible huh? Then why do I still think about this place?

pineapple.fried.rice. I will be back for you."}
{"text":"Food is not bad for the price. Good place to go for thai food and for cheap. It's hard to find."}
{"text":"Awesome place to grub if your hungry! 

The soups are top shelf, all of them and the Thai tea was perfect! Soup was out fast and the dudes in there were fast and helpful. I recommend this place to anyone that's interested! So so bomb!"}
{"text":"I come here pretty often because the location is so convenient and I work just right around the corner as well. Like anyone who likes thai food and is rather basic lol, I always get the pad thai with steamed tofu. Prices are super reasonable (entrees ranging from $6.95-8.95) and portion sizes are big as well. Their serving sizes can feed about two people but I definitely recommend doing family style and just ordering a lot of entrees and sharing. There's so much to order so you can't go wrong there. Other than pad thai, I usually get their green and yellow curry with either chicken or pork and brown rice. Most of their dishes give you the option of your choice of protein which can range from shrimp, chicken, pork, steamed/fried tofu, beef. I like their pad see ew but it can be a little too salty but it's been different everytime I've ordered it. If you're sick, I definitely recommend their Tom Kha or their silver noodle soup which is a bit simpler but still good. Their thai tea isn't overbearing (too sweet) compared to boba shops. 


Only huge downside to this place is that the workers here can be pretty rude or come off really cold and mean. It's honestly just a hit or miss though. A couple ladies that work there have been sweet and provide really good service but most of the time, they are pretty rude and give you attitude. I wasn't sure if I was the only one who noticed it but a couple of my friends who ordered pick up and dined in found the workers to be rude too. That's the only downside I can think of. It's not something they can exactly control but it sort of just kills the mood when you're trying to enjoy the food and ruins the atmosphere a little. Food is on point and the interior is pretty small and cozy but there's nothing wrong with that. Overall, a great place for authentic thai food for affordable prices!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location for lunch.  It was located on S Wynn Rd/Spring Mountain Rd in Chinatown in Las Vegas. The restaurant was not fancy.  It was kind of a dive.

We were given regular menus.  We had to ask for the lunch menu.  They serve $7.95 lunch specials which include a choice of 2 entrees, soup and an egg roll or won ton until 4pm.

I ordered the Garlic Pork and the Panang Chicken Curry, both Thai Hot.  The complimentary soup was Egg Drop.  It was served luke warm.  The Egg Roll was the standard vegetarian egg roll with sweet and sour sauce.  The Garlic Pork was luke warm, but the flavor and heat were good.  The Panang Chicken Curry had tender slices of white meat chicken and not much else in it.  The heat was good.  It was Thai Hot.

My friend ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Pork Green Curry.  She didn't have any complaints."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall, at best. Luckily, the food is amazing. I had the pad see you with tofu, and it was delicious. Can't wait to try some more dishes next time."}
{"text":"I just love Chinatown, even for the Thai food. My new favorite place to eat there is the discreet Thai Style Noodle House located adjacent to the large Chinatown plaza on Wynn Road (a second location on Ft. Apache and Trop opened last year). Not only does it offer some of the best Thai food in Vegas, but the prices are unbeatable.

There isn't much of an ambience, but I like that quality in my favorite hole-in-the-wall restaurants. And hole in the wall this is. They aren't bringing in drive by traffic, the signage isn't great, and you park in the delivery alley, but the crowd packed in (and sometimes waiting) at lunch speaks volumes of the food and value.

The chicken larb, my husband's favorite, is top notch ($6.95). It wan't served traditionally with a cabbage wedge, but rather with chopped iceberg. Though this is a little unconventional, I liked the salad quality of the dish. The green curry fried rice ($7.95) is filled with fresh veggies and tender slices of pork, and has a slightly creamy quality. If there was risotto in Thailand, this would be it. I also enjoyed the Choo Chee Shrimp ($8.95) and Spicy Green Beans with silky chicken ($6.75). The Beef Noodle Soup ($6.50) had an exotic favor sweetened by spices, though the beef itself wasn't as tender as I would have liked.

Everything on the menu is so inexpensive you won't worry about looking at the lunch special menu, but if you are dining alone or just not a \"sharing\" kind of eater, these options will allow you to try several different item combinations for under $7.

Downside: If the place is very busy, it takes awhile to get your food. The servers are attentive and polite, however, so there is comfort in knowing it isn't taking forever because the staff is slacking off. My suggestion is to avoid peak times, or order take-out."}
{"text":"The first time we went here, we ate in and had a great meal, and I gave it 4 stars.  We were so happy after that first visit that we returned and took along another couple - who may be moving to our fair city - to introduce them to life as locals.  Our experience was less than stellar.  But I didn't update my review then.  On the second visit, I ordered the same salmon dish I had the first time, and it was so bad I had to send it back.  The waitress tried to explain that they use frozen salmon, and yada, yada.  Its replacement was just ordinary.  The other couple were split 50-50 in their opinions of their dishes.

During our first visit we wanted to get more information about take-out, figuring that we'd be doing that on a regular basis.  We particularly wanted to know about the soup.  Our Tom Kha was fabulous, and it was such a big bowl that we couldn't imagine we'd get that much if we had it as take-out, but the waitress assured us it was a very big container.

So on this uncharacteristically rainy night, we opted for take-out from Noodle House.  My first disappointment was taking an ordinary Chinese restaurant-type plastic container out of the bag that was only three-quarters full.  It turned out not to matter:  the soup was so unbearably spicy that we couldn't finish it.  It also had half the amount of chicken that our dine-in portion had.  

Four vegetable spring rolls were decent, but very greasy.  

We ordered our main dish, Pad Thai, as a chicken-beef-shrimp combination.  It had a \"generous\" helping of two rather small shrimp, chewy and flavorless beef, and some tender chicken.  This dish is usually very bland at other Thai restaurants, but this one was very spicy.  I didn't mind that, since it didn't cause smoke to come out of my ears like the soup did.  But the noodles were rubbery, and if it had chopped peanuts, there weren't enough to taste them.  A disappointment.

I guess it was too good to be true, but we'll go back to the other Thai restaurants we used to go to before our hopes were raised by the opening of Thai-Style Noodle House, which is so much closer to our home.  Those hopes sadly have been dashed."}
{"text":"Thai Style Noodle House has tasty Thai food for a great value. The prices are low and you get  sharable sized portions. 

I started off with the Appetizer combo which was about $7.95. It had Chicken Satay , Crispy Shrimp , one  Egg Roll, Crab Rangoon, Wontons, and  a tiny cucumber salad. It also came with dipping sauces (sweet and sour and peanut butter ). If I had to pick one thing off the platter the Crispy Shrimp would be my favorite . It is shrimp wrapped in a egg roll wrapper then deep fried. 

I ordered the BBQ & Chinese pork Fried Rice  for $6.95. This was plenty to split and also take some home for lunch the following day. The rice was delicious it wasn't soggy and had fresh veggies in it. I've seen some places that put frozen vegetables in their rice which is a total turn off. 

The service was great we had our drinks filled constantly which is important when eating spicy foods. Thai Style Noodle House is a chain so there is more than one you can go to in the Las Vegas Valley."}
{"text":"The place was kinda hard to find but we managed to find it after a drive up & down the street ;) 

I was so hungry and so disappointed after this visit. I was left with a bitter taste of Thai. 

 I will most definitely not be recommending this little place. I'm sorry I have to do this but it's just not possible to find anything positive. They use the cheapest/inexpensive quality of meats and its really visible and tasteless. 

I always love to have Thai ice tea in every Thai restaurant I visit, and that wasn't even a great taste. I had to request a different drink something that didn't taste like soap :( yes my ice tea tasted like soap! 0:

The customer service was not really good. I wish they would be more helpful in recommending dishes and so on. Anyhow I have an idea of what I wanted but they didn't provide most of the Thai dishes so, I had to order similar ones that didn't come close to taste nor the look of it all.  

Not a fan :/"}
{"text":"Good food but cook was taking naps in the bathroom.......over all good Tom yum one of the best Tom yum I've had"}
{"text":"When we came in we were surprised to see how small this location is compared to their other location. However, the food was just as good. The potstickers were yummy and the fried chicken over fried rice was perfect!

Prices are very fair too! Only complaint would be about the service.. we had to wait quite a while for water to be refilled even though the place is tiny and wasn't full. The servers were sweet but they spent most of their time sitting and eating their own meal."}
{"text":"I will say that it is a good value. You get large portions for a little money. The quality isn't bad,and flavor is okay too. 
However,.... there is also, nothing spectacular, and nothing amazing that I experienced.
We ordered via phone for delivery,  delivery time was estimated at an hour and a half, so decided to pick it up instead. 
Ordered: the Fried Snapper, didn't specify the \"whole fried snapper\". oops...... the version we got was still tasty.
Ordered the basil fried rice, the duck fried rice, beef salad and the chicken pad see eu. The total bill was 41.00 and it was a lot of food.
The basil fried rice was good.The flavor was there, but I ordered spicy 6 and it wasn't quite spicy enough for me. I am used to Pan Asia spice.....
The Beef Salad was not at all to my liking. My husband liked it, but the flavors simply didn't jive at all.... a bitter kind of taste I thought. 
The Pad See Eu was bland.....The spicy levels are low here, so don't be afraid to order high! If I order here again I will order 8 or 9 spice level.
Also, I didn't order any curry..... It is hard to give a true and accurate review of a thai restaurant and you don't review any curry!?!?!?!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great customer service.  You can tell how good a restaurant is by how busy the place is and boy is this place busy.

Deliveries are usually between 30-60 min and the take it is about that long as well.  But the food is so worth it.  The chicken soup and the duck pad thai is soooooo good it's hard for me to order anything else when either sitting there or taking out or getting it delivered."}
{"text":"The food here is decent BUT the reason why I'm leaving 2 stars is because EVERY SINGLE TIME I order for delivery, the lady who takes my order does not speak good English AT ALL and there is always a communication barrier. It takes 20+ minutes to put in a simple delivery order. Insane! On top of that frustration, she gets upset with me because I make special requests (which are so simple btw) because I like my food prepared in a specific way and she seems to get overly irritated with me. Did I do something wrong by making a simple request of how I (the paying customer) likes to have my food prepared? I don't think so! She acts as if I'm difficult when in fact it's the other way around. 


Here's a solution: Put someone who speaks clear English to take delivery orders. 

This is EXTREMELY frustrating and the next time I visit in person I will be addressing it with the owner or manager and if they don't acknowledge this as a valid concern then you lose me as a customer forever. Not that they care but I'm making it known in case they read this review. I actually placed a delivery order today and experienced the same problem AGAIN. I will no longer be ordering from here because I get tired of dealing with people who can't speak English clearly enough to communicate effectively. Especially when I am a paying customer. If it was free I wouldn't care. But I spend $30+ every time and I get tired of the communication barrier.

Had to finally get that off my chest!"}
{"text":"Very tasty lunch experience. My guy had a craving for some noodle soup so we headed over to Chinatown where he spotted this  place and saw the Best of Las Vegas signs in the window. Very crowded place for a weekday lunch hour, good sign. We got seated pretty quickly. Place is a tad dark inside. The menu is easy to read and understand (for those of us unfamiliar with thai food such as myself).  He got some sort of pork noodle soup, my bad I forgot the name. I ordered a very tasty shrimp dish that had rice vermicelli and crushed peanuts in it. Also it had some tiny fried egg rolls, very nice presentation. Huge portions. My guy also ordered some spring rolls which he ended up taking to go because he was too full from his entree. Service was OK, no complaints."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Monday, only a few other customers at the time but service was very slow. Took forever to take our order, because the waiter was as sitting behind us eating his lunch. Ordered the lunch special with yellow curry. 2 stars for the curry because it was decent. But the spring roll and wonton they give you is sad. Had to remind them about the soup because they brought our entrees first, by the time the soup came it was cold so it was a waste. I had high hopes for this place because its close by, but I think I will just drive to Pin Kaow next time."}
{"text":"We ordered the BBQ wonton soup, spicy basil noodles and the egg fried rice. Thai tea was very good. My combination spicy noodles level spice were really good, not too oily and they had a lot of vegetables and meat. The egg fried rice has delicious. Added rice noodles to the BBQ wonton soup and it was enough for 2 people. Prices are very reasonable which makes this place a great value. Nice decor complete s the experience. We will come again next time we visit Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Thai Noodle House is easily my favorite Thai food in Vegas, especially since my second choice closed down recently. The boo and I recently ordered take out from this location using UberEats. Our food actually arrived quicker than the quoted time which was nice surprise. 

We ordered the crab rangoons to share. They were perfectly cooked, crispy and did not skimp on the cream cheese filling. I also thought the portion size was pretty big for the price. (5/5) For an entree I had the Shrimp Pad Thai. I do wish they gave tofu as a meat option as well, but nonetheless the shrimp was delicious. I had mine at a 7 spicy, which I didn't think was too overly spicy at all. I probably could have gone higher. The portion size on this was also huge, enough for dinner and lunch the next day. (4/5) My boo had the Pad See-eu, it looked pretty tasty and I tried a couple of the noodles. Both solid noodle dishes. 

I can't comment on the service inside since we got delivery, but overall the food was very good."}
{"text":"So, I only came here because I heard someone got salmonella at Krung Thai.  And duuuuuuuuuuude!  I have to say that the Roasted Duck Curry is pretty amazing.  I'm eating it right now.  Literally.  Eating... chew, chew, chew... right now.  

The shrimp fried rice is pretty flavorful as well.  No soy sauce or other crap is needed.  I got a fried egg on top.  Get that as well.  The egg yolk is the best sauce you can get.  Ever.  Ever ever.

We also ordered Tom Yum.  I haven't eaten that.  I'm still eating the duck curry.  I also have some edemame sitting here.

All in all, we spent $30 + $4 in tip.  For what amounts to 2 meals for 2 people, I don't see how this COULDN'T be a good deal."}
{"text":"This place had an interesting mural thats thau theme. I really like it. The staff were friendly and patient. The place is really small and fits about 30 people total. Expect to wait when is busy. I found the food was decent but not great. It tasted lacking in quality and taste. I am very particular about thai food and this place was lacking to me. Recommended to try but dont expect to be blown away.


Rag na: 4/10
Its was portioned big but lacking in flavor

Mongolian beef: 5/10
Good kick and flavor, reasonably portioned

Green curry fried rice: 6/10
Good and kicking in flavor

Pad see eu: 3/10
I was sad 

Pros: prices, mural
Cons: lacking, small

{"text":"Ordered veggie pad thai via UberEATS from here, however accidentally received chicken pad thai. I contacted the restaurant and spoke to someone named Pang. She was extremely apologetic and nice, and did take care of the problem after I informed her there's no phone number i can find to contact UberEATS as she asked. Although i was disappointed at first and had to have my husband pick up the new order, their customer service did seem to make up for it!
Pad thai was delicious.
Will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"Be careful when you ask for spicy, because you will get exactly what you asked for. 

That was our first mistake the first time, LOL.  Jesse and I love spicy, but we were sweating just on the appetizer we told them to please refrain from making the rest of our plates spicy too.  So a word of advice, go with either Mild or Medium and if it is not spicy enough, add your own spices!  

The next few times around we are educated in the spice levels.  Our usual go to's for Thai plates are Papaya Salad (Fresh and Crispy), Tom Yum Soup (Delicious with white rice), then something curry or seafood.  Their Tom Yum is bomb...like as in good =)  

Service is awesome and this place gets rather busy.  One time we waited around for them to open and we weren't the only ones waiting around.  

If you are a vegetarian, there are lots of choices for you here.  Its always one of our favorite spots when were in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch when Soho was closed and the bar wasn't serving food. We figured why not? Came in and waited to be seated about 5 minutes. Took about 15 minutes before anyone came to take an order for drinks. They finally came and took a drink order and little bit after they took out food order. Coworker asked for a lemon for her water but... they were all out of lemons. Good gets there, I ordered the Tom Kha soup. It was delicious! I saw they had stocky rice with mango so I asked to order it but... they were out of mango. Not only that but the guy was rude about it. So anther server brings us the bill and I ask him to please add an order of sweet sticky rice since I remembered I had a mango at the office. He takes the bill and the guy who said they were out of mango looks at me and says \"You didn't order the rice.\" So I said \"I asked him to please place an order of the rice on my bill.\" He rolled his eyes and left  to clean up a table. The other server brings me my bill back and... No Sticky Rice. That means they didn't place the order. We grab or stuff and go. I give it a 2 not because of the food,  but the service was horrible. I might order from her again,  but only if it's to go. They can keep their attitude. I'd rather go to Archi's for thai food. Service is better."}
{"text":"WOW!  Great prices and delivery.

Loved the avocado curry and spicy basil tofu."}
{"text":"Love this local gem.  The food is always consistent and the service is always quick. The interior design throws you off a little but make no mistake, with all the Thai competition in town, this one holds its own. Here is the breakdown of a few staples:
Thai Noodle House Pot Stickers, Duck Fried Rice, Spicy Basil Leaf Fried Rice, Yellow Chicken Curry, Pad Thai with Shrimp, Garlic and Pepper Chicken (my favorite), and the Spicy String Beans with Ground Pork.  My mouth is watering just thinking about this place!  Make sure to order spice level 3 if you are not a big fan of spice, it is just enough for the flavor but not overly spicy!  If you live in the area, or just passing by, make sure to give them a shot. It's local flavors like this that make neighborhoods great!"}
{"text":"Always packed because good food and cheap. 
Duck soup and thai bowl are very good comfort food. Strong taste of soup.
Curry with shrimp and avocado was good too, but with the avocado was too much. Curry with shrimp alone is good enough.
Chicken satay with peanut sauce was pretty tasty.  

We go there everytime whenever we go to vegas.
Highly recommend. 

Service is slow sometime because they have to cook all the dishes from one table, then move to the next table. Just wait patiently"}
{"text":"Great Thai food! Simple plates for if you don't really eat Thai and other Thai favorites!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the setting of the resturant is beautiful. It's not old or run downed, very elegant and up to date.

Their service on the other hand, horrible!!

First off, when we got there a lady brought us water, with 1 little piece of ice? Not a big deal ok, but then we noticed all our drinks had things floating around in it?? We ask the lady to get us new waters. She kindly did, brought it back again with no ice. I asked for ice because I like my beverages cold. She tells me \"oh the ice is dirty\" I'm like dirty? She said \"yes that's what's floating in your water.\"

Should have just walked out then.. Regretted it.

We ordered our food, ordered SHRIMP FRIED RICE, Pad Thai and Padse eww.

The lady brings us SHRIMP rolls and states \"I'm sorry for the Inconvience\" we atomatically assumed it was a comped treat due to the fact that they had dirty ice in our drinks. So we ate it!

Then they gave us the pad Thai, don't get me wrong it was alright. Could have been better.

And 15 min later came out with the pad se eww, we thought the fried rice was coming since the food was taking forever to get to the table. Finally 15 min after we got the pad se eww, we asked where our SHRIMP FRIED RICE was. The lady comes and tells me there no record of that order, when the server clearly repeated my orders to me before he walked away! Oh already livid she brings me the check..

AND GUESS WHAT!

She charged me for the shrimp rolls that I DIDNT ORDER! I asked her why she charged me, stating that I ordered shrimp fried rice and you didn't get me that not shrimp rolls. 
She then asked \"why did you eat it?\" I informed her we assumed it was compd since you said sorry for the Inconvience when giving it to us.

She then went to talk to the chief and server and came back stating THEY!! READ THAT, she said THEY!! Made a mistake with my friends rice & that we ate it so we have to charge you. I informed her if I knew you ordered it for us, then we wouldn't have at it.

The food was alright, but not alright enough so I'm definetly NOT coming back, nor would I recommend this place to anyone.

GET IT TOGETHER PEOPLE!"}
{"text":"#1 place to get a genuine thai iced tea if you're craving one. It usually lasts me two days if I order one for myself. 

But also their food is a plus. My boyfriend and I always come here when we're craving panang curry, which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Oh this place is good!
Their portions are more than enough, and everything tastes so home made!

Its open late! Im not sure how late, but its open late, and this is my go to place after I get out of class and want to grab some good asian cuisine."}
{"text":"This is a small building, so it's good for small groups. The staff that helped us were polite and took our orders quickly (it was moderately busy). It took about 15min for our food to come out. 

We got an order of the Thai tea. It wasn't overly sweet and it was good. It's not out of this world but better than other places I've had it at. We got the beef noodle soup with egg noodles. You had a choice to choose between 4 types of noodles. The broth was very flavorful and the egg noodles were good. The meet was soft and not dry. It was a fairly big bowl and matched the price. We also ordered the fried chicken over fried rice. The fried chicken was cooked very well and the fried rice was great.

One thing that did bug me was when we didn't write the tip on the bill when we signed one of the girls asked my girlfriend whom came straight out of the bathroom,\"you're going to leave tip on the table, right?\" or something along those lines. We of course had full intention to leave tip, but that left a sour taste for you our experience. Ended up leaving $2 for that."}
{"text":"The food overall was pretty delicious. We ordered the panang curry with chicken, tom kha, and shrimp pad Thai. Dishes have a spiciness rating from 1 to 10; 10 being the spiciest. We ordered the tom kha and pad Thai with a 6 and the panang with 7. The spiciness was pretty consistent with the spiciness rating and the meals had a good enough quantity to fill us up & take the rest home.

Also, delivery from this place is good. Sometimes the food will get to your place faster than the estimated time they say it will be, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"This place is \"okay\" for vegas (DOESN'T compare to Thai food in LA).  This so-called Thai restaurant seats about 20 people.  Their menu is actually a mix between Chinese and Thai food.  

It was really disappointing to open the menu and see things like Orange Chicken on the menu.  Really?  Really?!  They don't even have basic Thai appetizers such as angel wings or fish patties.  We were actually debating to leave the place without ordering because it did not have a lot of Thai dishes, but the employees were too nice so I decided to stay.

We ordered two dishes (because there really wasn't anything else on the menu that sounded Thai, nor appetizing) -- Boat Noodle Soup and Chicken Basil.  The noodle soup had a good flavor, but they did DUMB IT DOWN BIG TIME for vegas locals.  They did NOT have the pork rinds, blood, lliver, and tripe that a boat noodle soup usually has.  The broth was really sweet too, which was overpowering until I added my own chili flakes to balance the flavors.  

The chicken basil was ok tasting, but wasn't great.  The place definitely dumbed down the spice factor too -- considering we requested \"medium\" for both dishes, the dishes were NOT spicy at all.  Again, I think this place is catering towards a clientele that can't handle much spicy food nor distinguish between Chinese and Thai food. 

My bf pointed out their water is filtered, which is a good thing, and that they \"flavor\" their water with slices of lemons and oranges in the water pitcher.  Just fyi for those picky water drinkers out there.  This also tells me that their soups, most likely, have a better taste because the water is filtered.

I would only come here again when I'm craving (semi) Asian food in Vegas and  cause it's cheap -- for two dishes it was only $14."}
{"text":"Very consistent food and service. Just about anything on the menu gonna make your taste buds rejoice. My favorite is the pad thai and seafood soup. Always very fresh. Close to my place makes it that much better went to je urge for thai takes over every brain cell in your body and you just cant sjhake it. Totally worth a Thai try."}
{"text":"Me & my gf were originally going to eat at SOHO Japanese Restaurant, but there was a 20 minute wait. We noticed this restaurant next door & it wasn't as busy. I've been to Archie's & Pin Kaow which are two other popular Thai restaurants in the area, but this restaurant is now my favorite Thai restaurant. You get a good size portion of food for whatever entree you order for a really decent price. We had food leftover to take home. I definitely would recommend having the papaya salad & Mongolian beef which was what I ordered. My gf had Thai beef fried rice & crispy noodles which was also very delicious. This is definitely a place you have to try out if you love Thai food!"}
{"text":"I had been to the 2nd location a few times, but this was my first time at the OG spot. Instantly, I knew why this place has such a following.

It's in their name folks. Thai Style Noodle House. They have fantastic noodle dishes (as does the 2nd location). I went with the Tom Yum Noodle Soup (with egg noodles) and I was not disappointed. That delicious broth along with the perfectly cooked noodles definitely hit the spot.

The place itself is small and simple. The people are friendly enough. But it's all about the food. On that front, you will not regret your decision to dine here."}
{"text":"We keep going back for more and more.  Everything I've tried has been good.  Fried tofu, pineapple fried rice, chicken fried rice, green curry, yellow curry, chicken satay, pad thai, panang curry, edamame, and on and on!  Nice dining room, never too long of a wait.  I'd say this is somewhat of a hidden gem since it's in the corner of the Smith's shopping center.

My wife loves it, my kids love it, I love it, and it doesn't matter if it's dine in, take out, or delivery.  Always good food and always good service.  

Make sure to specify you want to pay with a CC over the phone for delivery though, as they hung up after giving me the total and estimated wait before I had the chance to ask to pay with CC.  Fortunately I had the cash on me!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here and my chicken was raw!!! Waitress did not even apologize and just said, \"Oh.\" Horrible service. Eat at your own risk!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I loved the décor of this Thai restaurant; they are definitely trying to be different from your typical Asian eatery. Although the décor was different, their food remained very authentic. I enjoyed eating their yellow, red curry and their pineapple fried rice, it was delicious! The only complain I had is that they do not ask you how spicy you want your curry to be. Most of the restaurants I have been to they always give you the option for it.
Ambiance: 8 out of 10
Food: 8 out of 10"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. 
I used to love this place but I probably won't be back now.
Went in on a Friday night at 6pm, they weren't busy. Ordered Shrimp Chow Mien. When the meal finally came nearly 30 minutes later, my 'Shrimp Chow Mien' had 10 measly little shrimp in it. It wasn't very good and there weren't many vegetables either, mainly noodles, not much else.

With SO MANY GREAT Noodle Houses in Chinatown, fortunately I have many other choices. Goodbye guys, it's been fun better up your game."}
{"text":"First time here, and we loved it! I ordered yellow curry with Tofu (you can choose fried or steamed) and the waiter asked me if I wanted fish sauce which I really appreciate since I am vegan. Also he asked me how spicy I wanted it , from 1-10, I said ZERO Lol and it still was a little too spicy for me, but nothing crazy. Other than that, food was delicious! My bf ordered green curry with shrimp, and he said it was delicious also. I liked that they don't charge extra for shrimp like other places. Price was very fair, $17 for 2 people.
We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little authentic Thai restaurant. I had the Panang curry and it better than most of the Panang curry I've had in Thailand. It's one of my favorite dishes and most don't cook it right but this place did. What a value!!! I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp and decided to check it out.  The restaurant is small and definitley family owned.  Which is my kind of place.  But really this place is not as amazing as i thought.  I was recommended to get the red snapper by the waitress.  I'm not a fan of the fish.  but we did order the fried bananas with ice cream.  I'm in LOVE with that lil piece of heaven."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. 

Good prices.  Actually great prices.  The plates were 6-10 dollars.  
The dessert with sticky rice, mango's and vanilla ice cream was delectable.  I don't remember what kind of curry I had here but it was flavorful, and the pineapple fried rice with cashew was awesome.  

Cons:
I tried #16 grilled Chicken or Beef salad with lime dressing...it was tasty but way too salty BOTh times! Pad thai..well...what can I say, I've had better..but it was decent.  

Overall, it was okay.  I would come eat here again if friends want but when i think of Thai food, I don't think of this place.  That says a lot unfortunately.  

If you are in the area, and you are in the mood for decent thai food, this would be it. Otherwise, I say skip it."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Coming from the bay area, we were pleasantly surprised by the abundance of the thai and asian restaurants in this Chinatown area of Las Vegas.  As other reviewers have alluded, the food in this Thai noodle house is cheap and they taste great!  We ordered the Tom Yum Noodle soup and seafood noodle soup.  Both were great.  This is one restaurant that we will come back again whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"Great value for Thai food. Little mom n pop place in Chinatown. Always friendly. Most entrees around $7-8. Good food."}
{"text":"I've been twice. Once for take out, and once dining in with my Mom. My take out experience was far better than my dining in. Really poor customer service while dining in. Had to ask for simple things like napkins because they were never given. 
I had their spicy Thai noodles and a Thai tea both times. The level of spiciness was very inconsistent. I got a 6 the first time and barely made it through the dish. Got a 6 the second time and tasted little to no heat. 
My Mom had the BBQ pork which she thought was dry. She kept putting the broth from the soup on it to make it semi palatable. 
Fried calamari appetizer was the best part of the meal.
Given it's close vicinity to my house, I'll probably only return if I'm really dying for some drunken noodles."}
{"text":"First time there today got beef larb it was DELICIOUS will recommend and definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, hole in the wall which is right up my alley.  Tofu and pad ped snapper is excellent!"}
{"text":"They have parking on the side as well. Good is great. Shareable quantities. No alcohol (just to mention)"}
{"text":"So glad this place opened right down the street from me! The BBQ pork wonton soup with egg noodles is AMAZING! & their Mongolian beef was delicious as well as the sticky rice!

Can't forget about the dessert either. Fried bananas & then the shop next door with the macaroon ice cream sandwiches are heaven!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Im trying to call to order for pick up, called about 8 times seeing if it was the right number. They \"answered\" but no one said anything for 10 minutes. I just heard the restaurant noise. Sucks! I know the food is good. You missed out on a 8 person order."}
{"text":"Great local Thai spot. Food is always good and the service friendly. I recommend the shrimp roll app, papaya salad, and duck curry. The soups are good too, though the other curries are just ok."}
{"text":"Not very happy at all. Came here for the first time today. We got Yellow Curry (worst I've EVER had), Mongolian beef (ok), and Pad Thai noodles (which I really liked). Service was pretty good, other than every time our waiter went to the back and opened the door there was other music BLASTING. You would of thought there was a night club back there. The potatoes were definitely OLD in the curry, my rice was hard, my food got cold really fast and by that time I was so turned off I was ready to go."}
{"text":"I came her for an early dinner dinner before a long drive back to Los Angeles. I was recommended to come here by a friend to try their Duck Fried Rice.

This restaurant is in an awkward corner behind a long strip mall. Parking is widely available during lunch time.

We were seated immediately and ordered the recommended Duck Fried Rice and also a dish called Khua-kai (pan fried rice noodles). The Duck Fried Rice had great flavor but the rice was too soft for fried rice. Fried rice should be cooked with leftover drive that has been partially dried out. I believe they used new rice, and that caused the entire dish to be a bit too soft for my liking. The Khua-kai was dry and bland, and I didn't really understand the concept or purpose of that dish. 

I will probably come here to retry the duck fried rice, and give it another try because of recommendations."}
{"text":"This is an average type of place. The food, the service and the ambiance are all adequate, but nothing special. It's priced fairly for what you get. If you are looking for a night that you will forget  or are hoping for \"nothing special\" and you aren't in a hurry to get your drinks refilled then this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Worth driving off the beaten path for great food. I will always come here when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Another great time in Vegas!  We found this location last year and loved it!   I was so excited that it hasn't changed.   The atmosphere was pleasant.  Quiet soft rock music in the background and tvs for us to watch nearby.  Nok, our server was great!   She was very attentive and kept the iced tea coming.  

Our food was really good.  I had Thai fried rice and my husband had Pad Thai.  And of course our egg roll appetizer was fried to perfection.   We will be back next year when we come back to town."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years. Probably the best Thai food I've had in Vegas. They give the right portion and the prices are reasonable and service is top notch! Try their duck fried rice or the pot stickers and their Tom yum noodle soup. This is better than Archi's, and Kung Fu, and even Lotus of Siam!  Also I'm Thai and I approve of Thai style noodle house!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here at least 2x a week! 
Our favorites: Sliced beef noodle soup with small rice noodles and the yellow chicken curry. 
The entrees taste exactly the same, every time we order!
Is it sad that the servers know our orders?"}
{"text":"[CUISINE]
I love the food at the other location. At this location the first time I came the Khua Kai was consistent with the other location. On my second visit it was not appetizing. The noodles were barely seared and there was a pile of pepper in the center of my dish. If this was my first time here it would be unlikely that I would return. :( I love the food at the other location so much so I may try it again. It could be that they are new and working out the kinks so I may give it another shot.


[DECOR]
I'm a huge fan of the other location on Tropicana and Ft. Apache. This location is a little awkward. It's too spacious and it feels very empty and unwelcoming.

[SERVICE]
When I arrived the server was assisting a to go order at the register. If I hadn't been to their other location I wouldn't have known that I needed to wait to be seated. The server didn't greet me with so much as a smile while she was assisting her other guest or say \"I'll be right with you\". I would recommend putting a sign to the right of the entrance similar to the other location that says \"please wait to be seated\" along with a sofa or bench where people can sit while they are waiting to be assisted. Currently there is just a tall plant there. 

My plate arrived almost 10 minutes after my husbands plate did. I had requested extra sauce and had to repeat my request when my plate arrived, and again after I finished half of my meal. About 15-20 minutes before the bill arrived I finished my Thai tea and wanted some water but the server never stopped by my table. During our meal there were 2 servers and three tables including ours... 

[PRICE]
The prices are very very cheap. Ranging from $7-$10"}
{"text":"Pad Thai was delicious.
Chu Chee Salmon was yummy.
Yen Tao Fo was incredible. 
Papaya Salad was fantastic.

This sums up my review."}
{"text":"This what I had hoped for.  Hole in the wall cheap authentic Thai food.

It was a little tough to find--it's not visible from the intersection but rather on Wynn, so don't think you can see it if you are on Spring Mountain.

The place is clean enough, the waitresses nice, the food isn't blow your socks off but it is good. And it is really really cheap.  It's what I would expect at any average place in Thailand.  

If you look at who is sitting around you, you'll realize it's appreciated by many for the same reasons."}
{"text":"We ordered every type of  curry and thought everything was amazing. No wait. Hit the spot"}
{"text":"I love this place. 

It's close by and prices are extremely reasonable! Some of their dishes are as close to authentic Thai food as I can get in this town. The staff is Thai and they service is fast and friendly. 

The food is yummy and great quality. I'm always weird about getting chicken at asian restaurants so I usually get beef. I feel like here, they are using only the breast so I get great chicken pieces in my dish. I grew up with chickens and sometimes, they were dinner so I'm picky and would only eat the breast if I had a choice. 

Portions are big! Big enough for me to make two meals out of. My boyfriend and I never spend over $20-26 here. This place never disappoints us! My favorite three dishes here are the Rad Nah, Pad Se Ew, Pad Thai. Mmm..."}
{"text":"This food was very good. We had the orange chicken, pot stickers and Tom Kai soup. The servings portions are large. The bathrooms, not so clean. We went to the jones location and will definitely go back! This is our new favorite Thai in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I thought I knew the China Town area well.  In fact,I've driven by this place several times but never noticed it.  Surrounded by all the other Asian eateries, you could easily miss this place.  

A hidden gem or a homey restaurant, call it whatever you like.  The restaurant serves food that is bold in flavor and big on values.  I ordered the Tom Yum Noodle Soup with Flat Noodles in medium spicy (4 stars) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VrGI7_nRjXpn0415S3coGQ?select=hA9qHyguVw4DhYdtn7IgzQ.  The broth had the perfect amount of sourness.  I thought I could take it, but the medium was quite spicy.  Next time I'd go for 3/10.  

My fiance ordered the Pad Thai (3 stars)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VrGI7_nRjXpn0415S3coGQ?select=S3VtsgqrAlnTZKTrTwo5jQ  The noodle was thinner and did not have purple cabbage or shredded carrots like most places, however, it had the right flavor and the right texture.  

Realistically it's 3 1/2 stars, but I bumped it up to 4 because of the value and service.  This is definitely a neighborhood restaurant worthy of your support."}
{"text":"Went there on Friday and was sorely disappointed. I had the pad Thai, which was bland and the noodles reminded me of old spaghetti. Crab Rangoon wasn't very good either. I'll stick to the soup if I come back again.... Definitely avoiding anything that could be that dry again."}
{"text":"When my friend introduced me to this place, I'll admit.. I was very skeptical about trying this place at first... given the location/quality of the store. But never judge a book by it's cover! The Roasted Duck Noodle Soup with Egg Noodle is amazing! A great hangover cure.. the broth is not too salty with a hint of sweetness from the duck. I do wish they would put bigger pieces of duck meat in it though, but other than that, one of the best duck noodle soups I've had ever. Also, the Roast Duck fried rice is pretty good also.. I think that it has gone down over the times I've gone there (maybe 5-6 times already). They started adding PINEAPPLES to the Roast Duck fried rice now.. so if you're not a fan of pineapples, make sure to ask for none. Anyways, this place still remains a tradition with me and my friends whenever we come to Vegas. Whether it's before we leave for home or just picking up a quick dinner/drunchies before clubbing, I know this place can deliver a great tasting and affordable meal!"}
{"text":"When at noon order my  favorite cucumber salad said they were out cause they ran out of cucumber really"}
{"text":"I was here for some take out. I ordered Pad See Eu with beef, Seafood Tom Yum and Fried Chicken with fried rice. My bill was $24 ish dollars. 

I am surprised by how huge their servings are! My tom yum didn't have any seafood in it:( it also lacks flavor and was very oily. The beef pad see eu was too sweet for my taste, and like the tom yum, lacks flavor. I loved the fried rice that came with the fried chicken. Rice was cooked al dente as well. The chicken was crisp, but I would not be craving for it. 

Place was clean and staff were polite. 

Overall, not the best thai place but it was decent."}
{"text":"Best thai restaurant I've been in vegas! Yellow, red and pineapple curry is THE best here. Tom yum is also the best here. I'm telling you, hands down the best affordable thai restaurant in town."}
{"text":"thai food is probably my favorite asian cuisine of all time and i can eat thai food every single day. after moving to vegas from houston i've had deep cravings for some authentic thai food and my manager told me about this place on wynn rd.

it's a hole in the wall place and parking is a bit strange. (i usually park at the rental offices/warehouse parking lot behind the restaurant) the restaurant is EXTREMELY small, it probably sits about fifteen people total. i've never dined in but the place is always packed when i go in for my pick up order. 

tom yum soup is to die for, omg i can eat this every day!
spicy basil fried rice is super yummy, i got it with chicken.
i also got a spicy rice noodle plate that is similar to the pad kee mao, which is usually my favorite thai noodle dish, and it was alright...could be spicier.

their spice level ranges from 1-10 and i order a 7 for everything.

their thai tea is probably the most amazing thai tea i have ever had, they give you a HUGE cup if you order a large. (feeds probably three people but i am a fatass)

to sum up, this has probably become my go-to thai place if i've ever craving thai, (which is all the time) and i recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really amazing food. You can't beat the prices. $61.00 for 4 people and we were stuffed. No liquor license though. Definitely my new place for Thai food until Lotus opens again."}
{"text":"The kitchen here is so fast and the prices are so good that you almost expect the food to be sub-par, but it's not. The food is good.

Pot Sticker Appetizer 5/5
Crispy and delicious, topped with sushi-like sauces and fresh spring onions. Highly recommended. 

Green Papaya Salad 5/5
Fresh shredded green papaya, tomatoes,  cabbage on the side. Spicy fish sauce dressing is awesome, but maybe a bit hot for some. Ask for mild if you're not a big fan of heat.

Pad Thai with Chicken 5/5
Perfectly cooked al dente noodles, fresh crispy bean sprouts, delicious pad thai sauce, juicy chicken.

Very impressed with everything here, especially for the price. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"There are things to like and then there are things not to like with this place. 

It's your regular American dumb down Thai food.  I had the Tom Yum Noodle Soup, and one word described the soup - sour.  Trust me, tom yum soup is MUCH more complex than just that.  

But then, for $6.95, the bowl of soup was pretty filling and I must say I was please with the portion for that price. 

On the other hand, the service I got towards the end with the male cashier will stop me from returning as a patron.  The girl who took my order and served my table was very nice and knew the meaning of customer service.  But the male cashier was beyond rude.  He refused to acknowledge me as I was standing in front of him waiting for my check.  I guess he was too busy sliding a credit card through the machine and couldn't possibly look up and smile and ask me to wait a minute.  

Nope.  I'd rather pay a little more for better food AND service from the man who is taking my money."}
{"text":"Thanks to Misti Y's review tipping me off to the vegan-friendliness of this place, I have expanded my realm of Las Vegas Thai food! 

Important note: do no use google maps to find this place, because you will end up at a XXX bookstore.  Which is cool if you need some porn to read over lunch, I guess, but annoying if you're just hungry.  The map shown here is correct (why didn't I just trust Yelp??) - it's two doors down from Veggie Delight.

So, yes, they are very accommodating with the vegetarian/vegan requests and happy to oblige.  I went at lunch, but ordered off the dinner menu.  Now, this may have been a mistake simply because they have an awesome lunch special! You can choose an appetizer (fried tofu, soup, or spring roll, I believe - the fried tofu looked awesome!) and one entree (~$5.45) or two (~$7.25).  That's a lot of food for cheap!

We shared a papaya salad, green curry with tofu and vegetables, and chili basil fried rice with tofu and veg.  We ordered everything a 7 out of 10 spicy, and it was perfect (I do like pretty spicy food!).  First, let me give these folks some love for NOT putting the much-maligned baby corn in any of our food.  The mere appearance of those mutants is always a buzzkill when I'm about to dig into a dish.  Second, the portions were very generous.  I'm a hearty eater as is my friend, and we had enough leftovers for at least one of us to stuff ourselves again.  Third, everything was very tasty.  Maybe not the best I've ever had, but delicious enough for me to eat til I hurt.  Four, the prices! Cheeeeeaaaaaaaap! $6.95 for a huge entree? yes please!

The ambiance was nil, but the service was friendly and fast, and I don't got to a tiny Thai place for lunch because of the ambiance.  This place is definitely going in the rotation, and next time hopefully I won't forget to order brown rice!"}
{"text":"Hit and Miss. Too much of a hit and miss though.
When it comes to food, It being great when it is great is not enough to overcome the times it's not by the food tasting as if it isn't cooked enough or has gone slightly bad or old.

For the most part when I've been here the Pad Tai is great and the soups are good too. But a few times iv'e gotten Pad Tai where the meat tasted as if it, as I said was not cooked enough or had started going bad or old. I got shrimp Pad Tai once, tasted very fishy. So I thought i'll just stay away from the shrimp, then one of the chicken Pad Tai's I got tasted the same way.. little old or uncooked. So I probably will stay away from here for some time and hopefully it gets better when I come back or try again.

Also the service is.. nice but casual."}
{"text":"I am in Vegas at least twice a month for work and this spot is on my must visit list for dinner every time!  I am a big fan of mom and pop establishments and this one is on my favorites list for sure!  
The service is always friendly and the food is always made to order.  My staples off the menu are the Pad Kee Mow noodles (I think they call them spicy basil noodles or something), fried rice, and penang curry.  The dishes are consistently tasty and the ingredients are fresh.  
Give it a try!  You will not be dissapointed!  They are opening another location this week I believe."}
{"text":"Thought the food was really good. The prices are really reasonable. The decor is very modern and clean. it's a nice look compared to other Thai places that I've been to."}
{"text":"2nd time here trying the pad thai chicken. Too sour & salty for my taste. Pad thai is the quint essential dish for a thai restaurant. Wasnt this bad the first time i came. Really quite disappointing. Not sure about other dishes."}
{"text":"excellent thai food and for a STEAL! Our favorites:

1) duck fried rice
2) roast duck noodle soup
3) green curry
4) pad see ew
5) pad thai

The only thing I can say is that this place fills up quick during lunch and the service can be a bit slow. Other than that, food is great and the people who work there are really nice. Check this place out when you're in Chinatown! It's a small hole in the wall but has fantastic thai!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that I am not a fan. I was so wishing for something to write home (or Yelp) about, but I walked away disappointed. The place was really not in good condition. The chairs were broken and the vinyl was torn on them. The table was sticky (THAT\"S THE WORST!), the staff were not friendly, and the food was only mediocre. Gosh I really wanted to like it!

One thing is that the seating area was so small that I was always feeling in the way and I couldn't relax and just eat. The tables are very close and some ladies were seated next to us and it felt like they were actually AT my table. That wouldn't be a big deal if they were nice people. They were very loud and speaking in a language that was not my own. They only would steal a few looks at us when they thought we weren't looking. It is natural to think that the people are talking about you, right? That's how I felt for some reason.

Avoid this place if possible. There are other places nearby that are better. Pho Kim Long for instance."}
{"text":"The food here is incredibly good. The portions on the plates are just enough to satisfy. The menu is extensive serving most of the thai traditional dishes. Compared to other places, this restaurant is not expensive at all but even if it was the food would be well worth it. Seems like its been remodeled cause the seating booths are nice and firm. The place is clean with 3 huge wall-mounted TV displays. If you're in the area I highly recommend Thai Style Noodle House."}
{"text":"Pretty walking in, but the allure ended there. We stood at the entranceway waiting to be seated while the servers were staring at us from the cashier stand; if they weren't going to seat us right away, a greeting would've been nice. 
The food was not that great. We ordered the pad see eu which was starchy tasting, and the pad ped snapper, which was pieces of fried fish fillets with veggies in curry. 
We also ended up waiting an extremely long time before getting the check, probably because they hardly ever checked on us. 
Definitely not impressed. If you want good Thai food with decent service, drive the extra mile to Pin Kaow or even Archi's."}
{"text":"5 Stars place !!! Great service and food is very authentic. Thanks"}
{"text":"The food was just about average. The quantities were sufficient. But I didn't find anything to rave about."}
{"text":"I've been to this business twice.  The most recent time I ordered chicken satay to go.  It was very good, but not my favorite.  The recipe and preparation is slightly different than my preferred satay, but it is still good.  A small peanut sauce and cucumber salad is part of the satay order and they are tasty as well.  It is in the same shopping center as a grocery store I frequent which makes it convenient, but it's not my first choice for Thai food.  The staff were pleasant and went  back to check on my order a couple of times.  The satay order was presented to me hot wrapped in aluminum foil."}
{"text":"This lil hole in the wall is amazing and always hits the spot after a long weekend of partying on the strip.

its seems like a family owned business which i love bc the food is usually more authentic and yummy that way. 

prices are super low and portions are large, service is good, plenty of parking. the end. (="}
{"text":"This place will only ever be eaten by me again.....oh wait never. Their tom kha has canned mushrooms and huge chunks of tomato. Wtf. I ordered pad kee Mao which I don't even know what they call it here but it was pretty much all cabagge and carrots with like a small sprinkling of noodles. Double wtf. You can tell these people are cutting corners and it is affecting the quality of their food. I won't give it one star cause it wasn't roach infested and for some people who have NO idea what good thai food is would possibly dine here, but for me it's a no go."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very reasonably priced and the food is great! I ordered delivery and I was happy that the food all came neatly packed and well organized. The delivery was also faster than the suggested time of arrival which is always a plus!

As an appetizer I got the N.H style pot sticker and I really liked them! They have a sauce on the top that balances the flavors really well. I also got the panang curry with white rice and I really liked the flavors and spice level. Even though this was \"mildly spicy\" it was still pretty spicy. The level though was perfect for me! I divided my order with the hubby and I thought the portions were good for two people. 

I am looking forward to dining in this restaurant and trying more items from their menu. Thanks for the fast service and good food!"}
{"text":"We order the Thai spicy noodle, combination thai fried rice and a side of sticky rice. The thai spicy noodle wasn't that spicy and it taste ok.  The combination fried rice taste average. The customer service suck."}
{"text":"Delicious food prepared fresh, generous portions, reasonably priced.

Don't let a hole in the wall kind of appearance fool you, food here is bomb. Tried their Pad See Eu and Rice plate with Cashew Nuts Entree- both were delicious!  The chef prepared them fresh from scratch for our order as we had requested them to be vegetarian (only with Tofu, no meat or egg). The spice was level was just right and food came out hot. Portions were more than generous at an unbeatable price. We ordered two main dishes and a Thai Ice Tea, the total came out to $17+ some change.

Ambiance is rather run down and service is also a hit and miss, but the yummy food just makes up for it. Go here only for the delicious food (and when you are really hungry ;P) and not if you are looking for something fancy. Also, they are very particular about their closing time. The hostess turned away a party of ten who entered the restaurant at 9:30 pm (they close at 10:00 pm) as it would not have been possible to prepare & serve the entire order within that time frame."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner here on a Tuesday night not busy and lots of people coming in and out for pick up.  I ordered Chicken pad see ew spice level 5 and my boyfriend ordered shrimp pad Thai level 5. The portions were huge. The pad see ew was flavorful and yummy. The pad Thai was good and the shrimp had the tail on, not a problem. Only thing was that we both ordered spice level 5 but my boyfriends pad Thai tasted slightly more spicy than my pad see ew which tasted like there was no spice on it at all. Nonetheless a great place to get a fix for Thai food cravings. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I was definitely skeptical when I first arrived to this hole in the wall restaurant adjacent to an industrial strip mall. A place with \"Noodle House\" in their name is usually an indicator of an unauthentic Asian restaurant.

I walked in and immediately noticed that the servers were all Thai. Phew.

I read some pretty mixed reviews of the Pad Thai and honestly it's pretty good. A tad on the sweet side, but good and GENEROUSLY PORTIONED nonetheless. The noodles don't stick together unless you order it to go and let it sit out. I would definitely come back to try their other menu items! Plus, everything is so cheap, go give it a shot!"}
{"text":"We've been frequenting the Thai Style Noodle House's Fort Apache location quite a bit lately, and I wasn't even sure if I had been to their Wynn location yet.  I looked all over for my review of the place confirming whether or not I had been, and lo and behold, I find it in my \"Unfinished Reviews\" section.  So, here it is...finally.

Thai Style Noodle House offers both Chinese and Thai food, but mostly Thai.  Our party of four ordered a few dishes to share so we could sample a bit of everything.

* Beef / Pork Jerky \"Beef / pork marinated in special Thai herb, dried in one sun and deep fried\" ($6.95) - We chose the beef option and the Husband is the real expert on this since he tends to get it a lot.  I found it to be just okay though, it was a bit too dry for me.  (Whereas other places make their variation a bit more moist.)

* Grill (Chicken, Pork, or Beef) Salad \"Your choice of sliced meat cooked with red and green onions, mint leaves, ground roasted rice, chili, and lime dressing.\" ($6.95) - We chose the beef option and the Husband loved it.  I thought it was just okay and lacked something - a bit more sauce and zest would have been nice.  Then again, this is something that the Husband has had a lot of.

* Roasted Duck Noodle Soup \"Noodle with boneless sliced roasted duck and Yao Choy in Thai herb duck broth.\" ($6.95) - This wasn't my top choice to order, and it was just okay.  There was nothing special about the roast duck at all.

* Pad See-eu \"Stir fried flat rice noodle and egg, Chinese broccoli in sweet black soy sauce.\" ($6.75) - This was okay with chicken and greens, although it was a bit flat.

* Red Curry \"Thai red curry with your choice of chicken, pork, beef mixed with bell pepper, bamboo shoot and basil served over steamed rice.\" ($6.75) - We chose vegetarian with soft tofu and I'm always a big fan of Thai curries.  They didn't disappoint here - good flavor and spice.  This was the real winner for me and I definitely would be back to try out their other curries.

We also had Thai iced teas all around.

* Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice ($3.50)

* Fried Ice Cream ($3.50) - It had a nice crunchy batter with little ruby-like things in condense milk.

Things I do appreciate about Thai Style Noodle House is that there are a lot of vegan and vegetarian choices, and they don't charge for brown rice.  I also like when they offer you a choice on the tofu - soft or fried.

Service - it was busy the evening we went and with one waitress, she was kept on her toes.  She was friendly and on the top of her game, but then again, Bobby Y. (a regular) was dining with us.  So I think that may have helped us there.

3.5 stars

(I'm confident that I would give them a four star if I go back and try out their other curry dishes.  But since I've been having them at their Fort Apache location, I can definitely say their curries are yum!)"}
{"text":"So, I'm an idiot but I read the delivery as $15 and it's free. I'm putting it out there so other folks don't do what I did and ordered $15 or more then expected free delivery only to get charged $4 for something I could've picked up myself.

Ugh. My bad on expectation and also communicating with them when I ordered if I had made the delivery.

Just explicitly putting it out there. They don't don't do free delivery. 

Food and price is decent."}
{"text":"The food was awesome, they were slow but our server is very attentive, I got the bbq pork with fried rice then babe has noodles idk what it called then got a calamari for appetizer  I give 4 stars because they do chit chat and didn't ask if we wanted the bill or anything"}
{"text":"RUN, DON'T WALK from this truly terrible neighborhood Thai restaurant.

Just about the worst service I've ever had in Las Vegas. 

Each person in our party of six ordered their own food individually. 

It was NOT a family-style or shared or buffet style order. 

Yet they brought out the dishes one by one, with each plate brought out several minutes after the last, So no one could eat at the same time.

They also did not bring out any silverware or extra plates for people who'd not yet been served, so it was impossible for people who'd been served to share with people still waiting for food.

They forgot about my order entirely. 

After being reminded twice to bring out my food, it finally arrived after everyone else had finished about half their meal.

So I ended up having to take most of my meal home, because others were done eating well before me.

To add insult injury, they then took it upon themselves to add an 18% tip to the bill, but then hid this from me by bringing me a credit card slip with a blank for a tip, obviously hoping to get tipped twice.

When we complained that the horrible service did not justify an 18% tip, they refused to lower it or remove it, claiming that they impose a mandatory 18% tip on groups of six.

The food is strictly ho-hum, mediocre, middle of the road. Nothing special about the food. 

I don't judge a restaurant by the decor, but the decor in this place is truly hideous, chaotic and disconnected. There's nothing even remotely Asian (or, for that matter, tasteful) about the decor.

For a better and more authentic Thai experience in the neighborhood, with excellent service, excellent food and beautiful decor, go instead to Pin Kaow on W. Lake Mead Blvd. and rainbow Boulevard"}
{"text":"Just like what all the other reviews say:
Delicious and very well priced.  Us 4 dudes just pigged out after not having eaten anything all day; apps, drinks, and entrees for everbody: $66 bucks.  This place is truly awesome."}
{"text":"Definitely a hole in the wall place (my favorite kind). Search for it, find it, enjoy it; you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Cheap, filling, and way better then the Strip's offerings

Pick up a small dish here and grab some poki next door and you have a jammin lunch.

It's simple people you grab the pad thai and get the tuna
(And then the Batman! =)"}
{"text":"Ok, so I have ordered here numerous of times. I always ask for spice as 10. Yes it had a kick to it. Tonight I was like I want spicy. Not your ten. I want real spicy Thai food. She was like are you sure? Yes I am sure. We always want it with more spice. Let me tell you.... EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING. EVERYTHING! Plus the service was amazing. They kept asking and saying no return because of spice. No way. It made it 10 times better. If you really like spice don't do the 10. Just tell them I really like the spice. They will make it to the T.

Everything I have ever ate from there is amazing. Take out, dine in, they always take care of you. Just really be specific. Just amazing food!"}
{"text":"Usually go to the one in Chinatown, which is always busy but the service is consistent and the food is always amazing. Came to this newly opened location, and although the decor is a lot nicer and the food still very delicious, the service left a lot to be desired. 

Came here on a Sunday afternoon, besides us, there were two, three other tables. Not busy at all. Two servers were present, and the entire time we were there, no one came to check on us, and we had to get their attention every time for them to give us napkins (which should've been given from the beginning anyway); to fill our waters; and then to get a box and then the bill. When we were ready for them to take the card, once again, we had to wave to them for them to come and get it, after waiting for at least 5 minutes. Every time the two of them were just leaning against the walls, not even busy or doing anything at all. I mean, someone's gotta make sure the wall isn't falling over, right?

Like I mentioned, the food was just as good as the other locations, price still really cheap, but the service really sucked. Won't return."}
{"text":"Used to be better, now every time when I come to this place again, I find the portion to be smaller, taste blander and with less veggies-to-noodles/rice ratio. Makes me remember why I don't frequent this place anymore, even though I used to like it a lot before, and to some extend, still feel the same way about their main china town location and the one on jones."}
{"text":"I wish this place was closer to me! Joel and I were on this side of town for his work and I used my trusty Yelp app to find a place to have lunch. I've been on a major Thai kick for a while so this place was right up my alley. 

The decor you can tell is trying to be fancy, but the diamond buttons on the inside of the chairs are a bit much. I did like the trees painted on the walls with birds. 

The service was swift and on point. They even offered me a to go cup for my Thai Iced Tea. 

The Noodle House has excellent lunch specials! Which we totally took advantage of. You can choose from one or two items from their menu. On this visit I ordered the Red Curry with Pork. Joel had the Orange Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. Our meals came with egg drop soup and an egg roll. The egg drop soup was really tasty. I had to stop myself from filling up on the soup it was so good. Plus, it didn't have that fake yellow color egg drop soup always has. My Red Curry was delicious. The pork was tender and the Curry itself had the perfect coconut milk flavor coupled with a great spice that wasn't overwhelming. The egg roll was crisp and full of veggies. Joel's Orange Chicken was also seriously tasty. It's normally not my thing, but it was so tender and not overly sweet. I kept sneaking bites of his chicken. Joel's Beef and Broccoli was also very tender and had great flavor. 

I wish this place was on my side of town. The price was awesome, but the food was even better!! What a great find on a side of town I rarely visit!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in all of Las Vegas, and I've been eating A LOT of Thai food these past few years.

It's just the combination of: 
- Everything tastes good
- The service is decent
- The environment is new, clean, and visually appealing with comfy booth seats
- The prices are virtually as low as it gets!

I just wish they had a location on the east side, because then I wouldn't go to any other Thai restaurant.

(Another great thing- it's adjacent to a dessert/boba place open til 4am daily with a ton of vegan options! After dinner at Thai Style, just go next door for dessert, a digestif, to hang out, or if you just want to prolong a date!"}
{"text":"This place has reasonable prices. They have a large selection of food here. The Satay Chicken is very dry. It was difficult to eat. I liked the Pineapple Fried rice . I had 3 helpings of it. Their Thai Tea is pretty sweet. The Phat Thai was good too. Their Green Curry Paste Fried Rice was really spicy."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here! We started with the potstickers which were awesome. We got the chicken pad Thai and spicy flat noodles for our entrees! The food is just awesome! They are very busy service at first lacked a bit but our food came out quickly and our bill was only $21!! Can't beat that! We will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Bangkok style Thai food w cheap lunches $5.50 , ordered ginger chicken/eggplant beef from lunch special. The sauces on both were tasty & flavorful, service was fine, it's a hole in the wall. Will hit this place again & try a chef special."}
{"text":"5 Star service, this place is very homely and hidden on the side of Wynn road.  It must compete with Dai jung gum (korean place) and Pho.  I think that their dishes are very homestyle:  The Panang and Veggie green curries are reminiscent of that from a can that I can make at home.  Their soup that comes with the lunch special however, is spectacular- No MSG and sweet from overloading of chicken and veggies.  

I had the Sliced beef noodle soup, Thai style. I was anticipating something spicy sour and sweet, but instead it's just beefy broth and thin pho-like noodles...  Not quite the kind they have in texas"}
{"text":"Good soup, if I am stranded in summerlin I know exactly where to go if I want a Thai version of Pho."}
{"text":"So far the best Thai restaurant I've been to. I've tried other Thai restaurants but I always find myself coming back to this place. The service is fast and excellent. The food are on point and very well seasoned. The price is very cheap. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Omg yaaassss!!!! 
Spicy level 9 is the business!

I'm one to always request a large side of limes and extra spice. Not this place! To perfection!!!

Prices are just Right also!! :D

Happy belly happy guest!"}
{"text":"I ordered the tofu and vegetable rice plate with brown rice and level 8 in that spice (fried tofu) Came out really quick! 

I went to the restroom, came back, checked social media and it was out! 

Tofu could've been a bit crispier and I also wished they had actual lemons or limes instead of the grocery store liquid form. It just doesn't taste the same as the real thing. 

The mango sticky rice though! 

Everything was still good! I'd definitely come back"}
{"text":"Wonderful little Thai food restaurant. Roast Duck Curry is phenomenal. Prices are very fair. If you like Thai food it is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The food here is inexpensive and decent quality. I come here often and every time is a different experience. The food is great and fast but the only complaint is their service. The customer service is very poor and they should definitely work on it."}
{"text":"Good food, but ladies do not work well under pressure. The only friendly and polite worker there was the guy who was bringing out drinks and bussing tables!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Found this place via Yelp and it was a bit hard to find on the outskirts of Chinatown. 

It was small and pretty busy when we walked in. The people there were pretty friendly and I tried to order what got the most press on Yelp.

My wife thought the pad thai was pretty good, but I got the crab fried rice and it lacked a bit of taste. I put a ton of hot sauce on it and it killed my appetite because I was starving, but I wasn't impressed. 

The mango sticky rice was pretty good. The rice was salty and the mango was sweet. This was the request of my wife's so I honored it. It wasn't bad and the prices were decent based on what you got, but I can't give it 4 stars because of taste.

It is a good find and maybe if I got something else I would be happier. They feature the hot soup, but when it's 115 degrees outside soup is the last thing you want."}
{"text":"I discovered this place here on Yelp. It is just the kind of restaurant my wife and I like to visit.

It did not disappoint. It was small. We were lucky to get there early before a huge crowd of people showed up. It was so full people turned away because you are basically waiting in the dining room.

However, the food was outstanding! I ordered the Tom Yum with the assortment of meats. I was asked how hot I would like it between 1-10. I said 6 because I didn't want anything too powerful, but I am one who usually doesn't shy away from spicy. It was maybe a notch below where I'd like it, but after eating all the soup it was certainly enough.

We also ordered the Thai iced tea. It also was incredible.

Overall, my wife and I loved the little place. We would love to come back when we visit Las Vegas again in the future."}
{"text":"What a gem!  Little hole in the wall with a great menu with many surprising items not usually seen outside of Thailand.  Soups are great, very savory broth.  Everything was very well flavored, cooked perfectly, nice portions.  Very small and usually crowded.  Thai people can be some of the most demanding restaurant patrons, and this place is always at least half full of Thais."}
{"text":"I only gave three stars because they were pretty stingy with the meat. The dishes were deceiving, you wont realize how little meat it had until you start digging in. Would rather spend my money on Pin Kaow which is only a couple of blocks away."}
{"text":"I am completely disappointed in my visit here. I live right around the corner and dine in or order delivery weekly for the past year. I order the same exact dish every time I come in. Tonight, as usual I get the panang avocado curry with shrimp. The flavor was the same as usual, yet the avocados were black and hard. I was disgusted. When I told them about it she basically shrugged it off and said what it's not suppose to be like that? Of course not! 

The way they handled it was very unprofessional. All I wanted was some acknowledgement that they did something wrong and should not be serving food like that. I still paid the full bill and tip $10 on a $30 tab as usall. I wasnt expecting any discounts. But the way they handle the situation was totally wrong. And now they just lost a good customer."}
{"text":"The delivery was early which was great. I ordered panang curry and crab fried rice. My white rice was soggy and had an odd smell to it. The crab fried rice was the worst I've ever had. They gave me a good amount of crab meat but the flavor of the fried rice was bland. The fried rice itself had a horrible texture to it. The rice was obviously old."}
{"text":"Came with Yelper Scott W. for lunch since he was in town. 

I haven't been here in years. There's other Thai in the area I usually hit up and if I want to eat at TSNH, there are other locations closer to home. It seemed they painted and it looks cleaner in here than what I remember. 

We started with a appetizer of potstickers. It's standard potstickers, but good. They do a trio of sauces swirled on it, not the typical soy based sauce. 

I got a rice plate of spicy thai basil with pork at a 6 level which wasn't that spicy so I doused it with hot sauce. I like my spicy, Thai level spicy and since I haven't been here in a while, I wanted to go middle of the road to gauge it. Still the flavor of it was good though.

Scott got red curry I believe with chicken and I took a bite and it was rather good. It was oddly more spicy than mine even though he got less spice level.

Service was decent enough. My water was refilled which is appreciated in this crazy heatwave. 

For a appetizer, 2 entrees and a drink for $22, this is some cheap eats. Definitely the prices are great since most is about $7. I don't think the quality suffers from it either as both entrees had food flavor and a decent amount of food."}
{"text":"glad to say they do have vegan options! I really enjoyed their vegan spring rolls && dumplings. its a cute little spot for quick dinning. super casual, and friendly service."}
{"text":"This IS as good as it gets for Thai food, .....period.  I've been to every Thai restaurant in Las Vegas and this takes the cake.  It's better than Lotus of Siam, it's better than Pin Kaow.  Even better IT'S SUPER CHEAP.  Go here..seriously.  This is the best Thai food in town.  Just thinking about the delicious broth makes me want to drool on my keyboard.  My wife HATES thai food but she loves this place.   Go here.  Do it for yourself because you deserve it."}
{"text":"We were surprised that this one was cute compared to the more hole in the wall original location. 

The BF and I shared the pineapple curry with shrimp. The curry was red curry coconut base which was decent. It was a bit too tangy for me, but it was well made and had a good amount in shrimp, pineapple and veggies in it. It comes with just a cup of rice, we had to ask for another cup, which is extra per cup. 

Spicy Thai noodles - think of it similar to pad se ew, but with other veggies like cabbage, tomatoes, carrots, onions in it. It wasn't very spicy though. In fact, they didn't ask us about our spice level at all, but maybe then they assumed to go mild. I should probably ask next time. 

For the portions, these were cheap... a few dollars less than the average going rate. The flavor I thought was decent. I don't know what it was about it, but I rarely get heartburn and did. It was odd is all. 

Service was just OK. We came an hour before their closing (20 minutes before closing is kitchen last call) and when we entered they kinda seemed a bit bummed we showed. They weren't the most attentive given we were the only ones there, but there were take out orders coming through still. I had to walk up to get my bill since the 3 people in the front were all busy doing something. The food came out lightening fast which was a plus, but also was maybe so we can get done fast. 

I was confused how this place didn't have a bathroom, but I thought sitting there how weird that was. I did see on some peoples reviews there IS a bathroom. You just have to walk to it on the side or something. 

There's several items on the menu that is unique to them, combined with a great pricepoint that makes it a good cheap option that's in a convenient of a area for us. I'm sure we will be back for more bites."}
{"text":"I actually have never been to this restaurant. I only made a delivery order once, and that time, they literally saved me, so yeah I am a fan.

I was dying alone being sick in my hotel room when I was in Vegas for work... I took a day off to rest my body to survive the rest of the week. I was craving for Asian food, but I did not want to leave my room. I started browsing on Yelp and found that this restaurant delivers only for $3 delivery fee, and the minimum order was only $15! I ordered a papaya salad and pad see ew. 

Within 40 minutes, a lady delivered it to my hotel! I had to go downstairs to pick up my food at the valet area, but that was understandable to me as it would take a long time for her to park her car and come upstairs. I was so so so happy that it was easy and pretty fast for a delivery order. Food was pretty good too! It definitely helped me to recover better than any food available on the Strip!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! My 2 sisters, my girlfriend and I all came down here for some food and found all of plates to be delicious! The place is a little small so it can get full pretty quickly, but it's worth it! They have good quick service and have a variety of options on their menu. Definitely one of my favorite spots now! I'll be back"}
{"text":"Low prices, great food, family-owned hole-in-the-wall.  I love coming here & imagining I'm dining in Thailand again."}
{"text":"Excellent thai food. We ordered chicken pad tai and BBQ pork wonton soup to go. People who worked there were very nice. Also it is very clean and new inside. I did not know they had seating or would just have eaten there. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"What a find and a short drive from the strip. Husband and I both ordered the duck noodle soup for less than $7 each. We were pleasantly surprised when the waitress asked what type of noodles we wanted our duck noodle soup. Hubby went for the traditional egg noodles and I went with the wide flat-rice noodles. The serving is big and they give plenty of duck meat. They even debone the duck so it's not so messy or tedious to eat. Broth is dark and so savory. I will definitely make this one of my stops next time I'm in Vegas and try another one of their soups like tom yum or go for the delicious and cheap duck noodle soup again!"}
{"text":"I dont need to be mr yelp 2000 something to yelp I am just yelping cos I love it. I dont want to put my picture cos sometime I am so honest that the restaurant that I dont like might put me as a target, but I never went back, hmmm. 

Anyway, this noodle house rocks. I went here 2 times order 4 different kind of foods and its all good. That my friend must be considered superb. Small and efficient. kind of hard to find if you come here the first time, cos its hidden. But its super good and affordable.

Cheap, great food and nothing else. Great service, they got the palm juiced and you know what, if you like spicy and you dont know what you should have, get the gway teow lord.!!"}
{"text":"Common question of a work day: \"What's for lunch?\" 

Common answer: \"Thai\"

I love Thai places at lunch that offer lunch specials because it's such a bang for your buck. Recently, my go-to, Archi's failed me. Disappointed with their pad thai, I was left to venture out other spots. 

Guess what? Thai Style Noodle House does NOT offer lunch specials, but their prices, portions, and taste make up for it! 

The pad thai was pretty good, not the best. It came out with a zero spice level, due to the server not asking \"how spicy.\" I had to ask for the spice rack to cater to my taste buds. I also ask for lime, which they did not have. Um, ok. They had lime juice, which I accepted. 

Yellow curry with tofu was tasty and they really hook you up with the tofu! The curry did not taste sickly sweet like some other places. 

Since my child was with me, I opted for a \"bland\" side dish. I got the scrambled egg with ground pork dish for $3ish. Perfect. It looked and tasted like a Filipino torta. It was a big portion and only dented 1/6 of it. 

Those on 30 minute lunches, I would advise calling in your order and picking up. Those with 1 hour lunches, it may not be realistic to dine in either. From ordering to receiving our food, was about 30 minutes. Then you have consider driving to and from, plus actual eating time, paying, and boxing everything up. 

Interior is cool, modern, and spacious. Seating is like 90% booths. Service was average.

Can't wait to return and try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Satay chicken is excellent. Shrimp wrap deep fried (appetizer) is good, skin a bit thick to my liking.  Other appetizers are average. Crab Rangoon not my deal.  Pad See Eu is very tasty.  Spicy Thai Noodle is good, 5-level spicy is a bit much for me. I'd go 3 spicy if you're not used to Thai spicy food. They take their spicy food very seriously, I will do a 3 next time for my self."}
{"text":"5 stars for hole-in-the-wall Thai - great food, bargain prices, basic atmosphere...often that's just what I'm looking for as a foodie.

I've tried a number of Thai places in Vegas and this is the best by far.  Thai Style Noodle House could hold it's own in the Bay area...and that's saying something!

As any good Thai restaurant should - TSNH brings the heat so aficionados can rest assured they will get the goods.  Thai newbies - I wouldn't order above a 5 (they do 1-10 on the heat scale).

This will be one of my go-to spots in Vegas from now on!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty okay here. The dumplings taste pretty standard but they spruce it up with tasty sauces. The tom yum noodle soup is flavorful. Pad see yew good but dry. The S16 noodle soup tasted interesting. Tom yum was yummier. Wish all the dishes had more veggies. 

Thai ice tea was pretty good. Not too sweet.

Bathrooms were clean. Staff was nice. Party of 17 came in while we were there and they just worked it out well."}
{"text":"I've bumped up a star because their curry is delightful and has only gotten better. 

Only downside - 

They still offer delivery, but the last few times I've called, they don't want to deliver. I said I would wait and hour...even close to two. They still are very rude about it on the phone. I had a lady say 3 times that it would be a wait, and I said each time it was fine.  She then proceeded to sigh into the phone like she was pissed. I said, \"Can I really not do delivery? I can't come in...but, I'm willing to wait.\"

If you don't want to deliver and you don't have time, say, \"We cannot deliver right now.\"

Geeeeeeeeez."}
{"text":"I was passing though and sought out this little place.  Good, satisfying food Thai food."}
{"text":"The best Thai Food I've had hands down. Authentic and very reasonable in pricing. Their Penang Curry is delicious and I love how they make it the perfect level of spicy!"}
{"text":"Nice place! Atmosphere is a little quiet for my liking and the walls need to not be bare white. Also needs more decorations to make it feel more Thai. 

Prices are really cheap compared to other restaurants. Portion sizes are big enough to make you feel gross after a meal."}
{"text":"Love the tom yum noodle. I ordered spicy level 9 but instead it was pretty sour. It is still edible. :)"}
{"text":"Wow. Im a local and im in the service industry. The service was probably the worst ive ever had in my life. If you want to be treated like complete crap when you dine out then this is the place for you! I wish there was a negative star rating for this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"I agree with all the other Yelpers! small hidden gem in c-town. Price is why i came here. Forget the dirty bathroom and so so service. The food is great! this is my new spot for Thai food!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the food...5 stars for the value and \"bang for your buck!\"

Came here for an impromptu lunch and ordered take out.

She got the Thai Beef Salad (Phone pic):

Which is served cold, marinated with lots of flavors here!  Huge portions and low prices...I think this was only $6-7??  Not my most favorite version I've tried, but it was good!

I went with my favorite dish as always, the Pad Kee Mao aka Drunken Noodles (Phone Pic):

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thai-style-noodle-house-las-vegas-4?select=VeZSixXFxYJjsa2y10mYdA#VeZSixXFxYJjsa2y10mYdA

It was good...definitely have had better, but the taste is there, spice is hot, and portions are large and very fair at again, only $7 or so?  Probably the cheapest I've ever paid for this dish, and one of the largest portions.  Also, they aren't afraid to make it hot!  This 10/10 Thai Spicy was very close to accurate in my book!

To me, this is probably the best bang for your buck Thai I've ran into so far.  The portions are fair, prices are cheap, and the to-go order was ready right on the dot, so grabbing for a speedy lunch is a safe bet!  

Glad I don't work down the street lol"}
{"text":"My husband is Thai and we tend to eat at Thai restaurants often. This is our regular place. It's one of the closest thai places to our home and the food is good. The portions are a good size as well. We are a family of 6 so portion size is important to us. We can eat here for less than most restaurants (including several fast food choices)."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing authentic Thai food!!!  this place has the best authentic Thai food in Las Vegas!  We had enough of high prices, long waits, and Strip quality.  I found this place while searching Maps for asian restaurants.  A short Uber ride, and we were transformed form the Strip to a normal little neighborhood.  

the restaurant is located just around the corner from a strip mall.  Inside it is quiet, family run,  with basic tables and chairs.  The menu is endless with all the things you find in Thai restaurants.  Our server quickly took our drink order and offered help with choosing.  Here is our dinner for two.  

We started with edamami, just enough to share.   The potstickers are obviously homemade and delicious.  The tom kha soup was perfect and big enough to share with all fresh ingredients.  the pad Thai was perfectly spiced, the shrimp Curry was nice and spicy and served with white rice.  Our food was all great and after all said and done...about $13 per person."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm.... Penang Curry. This is my all time favorite Thai dish and they made it just how I liked it. The taste of the curry with the hot spices weren't salty and that's what I found in some Thai restaurants. I did wish I would've eaten there as the restaurant had that local feeling to it. I imagine that's what one of the restaurants look like in Thailand, small and cozy. 

My bf ordered the BBQ Chicken over Fried Rice. He was very impressed with this dish, from the presentation to the flavors that married together. The charred taste of the chicken was also what made his taste buds happy. 

As a third dish, we ordered their pad Thai. I don't think I would order this again. Maybe I just am not a fan of pad Thai but I have had a better version of it. There was just something about the taste that didn't quite agree with my pallet."}
{"text":"Great place for noodles.  Most of the dishes are Thai in origin.  This place is one of my favorites whenever I have a random Sunday afternoon noodle craving.  It is a small place, and that fact lends it a certain level of uniqueness and character.  Everything I have had in this place is awesome, from the dishes to the drinks.  A++"}
{"text":"Same menu just like the other ones. The New decor is nicer than the other ones hands down"}
{"text":"I love this place. The Pad See Ew is my favorite. You must go with the Thai Hot to kick your food up. I am on level 5 out of 10. The goal is to get to 10 and see if I can handle the heat. My new favorite is the Tom Yum Soup with Chicken and wide noodles. Nice cozy place and more than one location which is always a good thing. The prices are fair and the portions are generous. I am Thai foodie and I've eaten at some of the best Thai restaurants from Los Angeles to San Francisco and I will say this place is at the top of the list. Oh, don't forget when you order the shrimp fried rice, make it Thai Hot. The heat in Thai food is what makes it so great!"}
{"text":"I was craving some Thai food and didn't want to pay 100 for fusion food on the strip, I needed some authentic thai and to save some money for my luck on the tables, the store is really close to the strip in Chinatown area. The shop is a small hole in the wall kinda tight parking so best to be taken Togo or even delivery via Postmates. The restaurant is really small and casual. I got the Tom yum soup, pepper fried chicken wings, shrimp pad Thai, pineapple fried rice. Everything was so tasty except for the dessert I purchased the sweet rice and mango, the rice tasted raw and not cooked, the mango was sad and they had one slice cut in small pieces, not juicy and plump like in the photos, it made me sad. The Thai tea was good a little on the sweeter side. All this for less than 25!"}
{"text":"One day almost one year ago I looked down at a chair here and declared, \"No more!\" I had lived with the hole-in-the-wall charm happily for quite some time, but the weathered cloth chairs and aging yellow paint finally got to me. I stopped going until this week. I saw on Yelp (what a helpful little site) that they had closed in November for remodeling, so I was eager to check out the new digs. 

It's true! They have new orange paint and new furniture! My butt was no longer hesitant to take a seat. The set-up is still the same, but paint and new furniture goes a long, long way. 

I ordered one of my old time favorites: broccoli and tofu served in a brown gravy. I must say I was a bit saddened by the broccoli to tofu ratio. I finished all of the broccoli and still had a solid half cup of tofu left. But, it may be partly because the florets were so darn delicious I inhaled them like a vegetable vacuum."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their \"Pick Two\" lunch option for $7 and change, and this location doesn't try to hide the lunch specials from you! Your options are extensive and include all of their curries, unlike some Thai spots that really limit what they offer on lunch special. It comes with soup, rice and a fried treat, and the two picks are served in a nice sized dish. I think flavor-wise they are really consistent with the original location, and this location is definitely up the scale on the fancy factor- white chairs, tile on the wall, was that a chandelier? Although, it is odd you have to go outside to go to the bathroom.

I selected the mint chicken and green curry for my two. The chicken is minced, and the flavor was nice, but I probably wouldn't order it again. I realized I am out of Thai Style practice because I didn't remember the green curry coming with a mountain of bamboo shoots. I am not a fan of bamboo shoots, but the curry still had a fabulous flavor. Next time, I have to remember to order it with vegetables, hold the shoots. And, next time, maybe I will go double curry."}
{"text":"My sister and I wanted to try a new spot in Vegas.  I didn't care where we went, and so my sister picked this place.  The place was pretty backed when we got there.  People would come in and out constantly.  When we got there, we were sat down immediately. When it came down to ordering, we ordered the seafood noodle soup and crab fried rice.  Although the icons on the menu signified our items were spicy, they weren't really at all.  I had asked the waitress if they had anything that would make our food spicier, and the lady said no.  Too bad for me...I love super spicy food.  Anyway, both items tasted pretty good.  I was eating hungover, and usually I don't really eat when hungover.  It somewhat curbed my hungover.  Thank goodness."}
{"text":"Friendly service, but parking can be a little tricky. They were very accomodating when I asked for vegan options. Quite a small restaurant with a handful of tight tables. Be careful when ordering spicy items, as I think my food was too spicy but still, very delicious!"}
{"text":"Quick stop after we landed before we head to the Grand Canyon, delicious, love. We got a lot of different dishes, loved them all"}
{"text":"We recently discover the Noodle House. We have eaten there 3 times and yet to be disappointed. Everything is always cooked fresh and served quickly. I highly recommend the orange chicken and the egg rolls. The servers are very friendly and helpful. It has become our favorite restaurant. The only real negative comment I can make is that the service is horrible."}
{"text":"Best take out Thai food since moving to LV one year ago; best Asian food take out since arriving in LV too!"}
{"text":"Disappointed that Lotus of Siam wasn't open for lunch on the weekends, I searched Yelp for the next best Thai in Las Vegas, and Thai Style Noodle House came up.

It's tucked around the corner on Wynn Road, just off Mountain Spring. Everything about it says \"hole in the wall\" except that they take credit cards. The seating area is small, so I imagine it could get crowded here during a busy time, but at lunchtime on a Saturday it was fairly open.

We ordered tom kha soup with chicken to start. It was a little too strong for my taste, and may have had a little too much lemongrass. Four of us shared yellow curry with chicken, panang curry with chicken, and pad thai. I'd say each of these dishes were between two and three stars. The curries were oily, not creamy, and the chicken at times seemed undercooked and rubbery. The pad thai noodles were too tough and chewy, but the flavoring was very good for the dish. The steamed rice was a little on the soggy side.

Our service was very good, however, and we were checked in on frequently. The pricing here was also very reasonable, which combines to save this review from being two stars, even though in terms of Thai food I really have had better."}
{"text":"Must try the Green Curry with avocado and salmon.  Excellent dish and good service.  Prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Great food. One of the best value in town    Rice dishes and noodles are both good. Nice local joint"}
{"text":"If you are looking for thai food near Venetian do not miss them.

I simply fell in love with their menu and delicious food,I ordered Tom yum soup,spring roll,panang and green curry with thai tea.

I was here for food so was not expecting much from ambiance and seating,will be here again on my next trip to vegas :-) Woohoo!

Highly recommend this place for the great taste thai food.."}
{"text":"I've officially found a Thai restaurant for every occasion ! I'm done trying new places, my Thai list is complete !

Komol: Homey, good for dinner with friends, nice atmosphere
Archi's: Americanized style stuff
Thai Style Noodle House: The perfect affordable lunch spot
Lotus of Siam: Gourmet all the way !!

Comparing this place to Lotus is comparing apples to oranges. Ok, so they are both Thai but this is like comparing In n Out to the $20 ribeye burger at Bradley Ogden. For some of the best Thai food in the United States - try Lotus (think James Beard nomination! If you don't know what James Beard is, don't waste the time/money to dine at Lotus). For a great hole in the wall spot that won't let you down, Thai Noodle House is fabulous !

Thai Iced Tea : The best rendition I've ever had. At $1.99, a killer deal.

Duck Curry: A bit thin for my taste, but the duck was high quality and really yummy !!

Fried rice with Chinese Sausage + bbq pork: well I guess this is more Chinese (they do call themselves Thai + Chinese after all), but regardless, it was delish

PANANG CURRY WITH AVOCADO: This probably isn't authentic.. at all.. but WOW best curry I've had in my life. Honestly. I would put this up against tri color curry from mix zone any day. I will eat here over and over again for this freaking magical stuff ! Creamy, thick, delicious. Now that I've had it I think all curry should come with avocado!!

In conclusion, this is that hole in the wall Thai place you've been on that quest to find in Vegas. Affordable, well executed, and some creative items I've never seen before ! I would never pit it against Lotus of Siam, but for what it is - it's awesome !"}
{"text":"The special combination soup is really good. Try it. I love their house tea.We tried their Fried rice with Basil & Beef, the flavor is good but a bit too oily for me.

Prices are good, service is great."}
{"text":"Food was very very delicious enjoyed the curry and the price is very good. The only thing i dont like was my appetizer \"egg roll\" but everything was gread and had a good service."}
{"text":"Try their duck fried rice! It is amazing!

I don't really care much for duck, but I tried their duck fried rice and it was so tender and juicy! The rice has pineapples in it too!

It's a hole in the wall place but their food is delicious. Also be sure to try their dumplings appetizer, those were good too. 

Decent pricing for their food as well."}
{"text":"So I tried the Won-ton Soup ($6.75) and it was unique. It had a unusual fishy flavor and was notably spicy. I ordered the soup in hopes it would sooth my sore throat, but instead it gave me an unexpected punch of spicy and fishy. It was not necessary the flavor I was hoping I would get. 

I have determined my favorite item on this menu is the #38 - Khua-Kai Rice Noodle ($7.25). This dish consists of wide rice noodles wok-fried with chicken breast, egg, and bean sprouts. I prefer to substitute the chicken for fried tofu. Any time I come to this restaurant I order a #38 and the N.H. Style Pot Stickers. 

----------------------------------------

Order your food ahead of time if you want to take it home because you do have a short wait time. The food is pretty amazing. They have really good Pad Thai here! Their N.H. Style Pot Stickers  are $5.75 and totally worth it. Will absolutely return again!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. You want ambiance, throw a fortune at a casino restaurant. Never disappointing and although small seating area, every bit worth waiting for a table. The food is fabulous. I've lived all over the world and this is in my top list. I might be pedestrian, but their food is awesome."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places to eat here in LV. Located by the SW corner or Jones and Warm Springs and very easy to get to. It's not the best Thai restaurant I've had, but for the price and quality of the food. It cannot be beat! 

The restaurant is very clean. There are a bunch of booths available that keep you secluded from the other booths; a plus in my book when it comes to eating with some privacy. There are big, flat screen TVs mounted on the wall to kill time while waiting for your food (which isn't even long in the first place). 

My go-to dishes are always the Pad See Ew and Panang curry. I've tried their other items but these two never fail me (and they're just that good!).

Whether you eat here, or call in for to go, you won't be disappointed. I am seated right away and if I call in for to go, I can count on my food being ready in about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue, because this has been my go-to Thai spot since I moved here 2 1/2 years ago. They have the best pad thai I've ever tasted- it's always moist, flavorful, and cooked to perfection! I also recommend their Chu Chee salmon! Their prices are cheap, entrees are $6-8 for huge portions! Service is fast, and when I order take out it's ready in 15 minutes by the time I get there. The restaurant is kind of small, so there could be a wait if you go there during the weekend at a busy time. They will forever be my favorite place for Thai food."}
{"text":"When in Vegas, you think you'd find everything on the Strip, but Chinatown has a few gems just a few miles away. My friend took me here for lunch and it was a great place for some tasty food and for a mild hangover. 

We ordered the duck fried rice and pad thai. The duck fried rice was delicious! Fried just enough, slightly sweet, and plenty of duck. I really, really enjoyed this dish. The pad thai was also good, not too special but just a staple when you go to a Thai restaurant.
 
It was pretty poppin on a Saturday so get ready for a bit of a wait but so worth it! Definitely try to get away from the Strip to try this place!"}
{"text":"the first time we had the tom yum noodle soup  here , it was soooo delicious !
on our second and third visit , it tasted nothing like tom yum at all . I think they changed the cook in this restaurant , and the taste is different now.
had the papaya salad on our last visit , and didn't really liked it . the fried banana with ice cream for desert was not bad ."}
{"text":"Last night, the server, whom goes by the name \"Liek\", went above and beyond with her customer service skills. She was really attentive, friendly, and personable...especially with my son. He accidentally spilled his water and without hesitation, both workers came to the rescue to help get our food to another booth and get it all cleaned up right away. \"Liek\" came to our table more than I've ever had a server come to our table, to ask how we were doing, how's the food, and if we needed anything. Although it wasn't busy, I was impressed with the extra attention and service we were getting. It made me feel bad for my last review I posted. My son went to use the restroom prior to leaving and \"Liek\" came by to ask if the bathroom was okay. She needs to be there more often! She definitely made the case of my Monday turn into a happy Monday.

We ordered calamari, seafood wonton soup with vermecilli noodles, and spicy eggplant with chicken. My oh my, was everything tasteful and to our liking. The spice was on point and that's a huge plus! I'm definitely ordering the soup all the time we're here. My allergies have been triggered tremendously and the soup definitely did my body good."}
{"text":"1/5 for the interior.
5/5 for the food.
Average: 3 stars. Seems a little unfair because I loved the food that I got here! The law of small numbers sucks and that's math for you.

Okay so upon walking in, you can see clearly that it is just a hole in the wall kind of restaurant. I will go as far as saying that if I were to sit down and eat here, it is like eating in the bathroom of a gas station. I'm truly sorry if I just ruined your appetite. Instead, I asked for a to-go order of a papaya salad and a red curry with tofu. The papaya salad was extremely fresh because the vegetables were very nice and crunchy. Love it!!! Similarly, the red curry had just the right amount of viscosity while being flavorful and delicious and full of fresh ingredients. So good that I ate half the container without even realizing it. 

I plan on coming back for more as I'm now a  huge fan of the food here!"}
{"text":"awesome place, great prices, fast service, and overall very good food. pad Thai was mediocre so avoid that. we liked the Penang curry, pad see ew, green curry, and some chef special noodle dish. we did take out, dine in, and a delivery during our last visit to Vegas and had no problems!"}
{"text":"So good! The Tum Yum Soup with chicken ordered with mild spice is absolutely delicious! This restaurant has excellent orange chicken, chicken satay, fried rice, and most of all, the mango with sticky rice. I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I decided for a Thai food night. Place is really clean and the food is great. It's just the service that sucked. We had to keep calling them over to either get us a refill or if we wanted to order more food. Giving it 4 stars well 4.5 since service wasn't so great the first time, but I came today with my mom and sister, and service was great. I didn't get her name, but she was very polite and smiled during our whole stay. Will defiantly be coming back for a third time . 
Also the price for the amount of food you get is perfect!"}
{"text":"Polite and quick. I ordered duck fried rice and chicken wings to go. Took about twenty minutes. Tastes great! Definitely coming back to explore the menu some more."}
{"text":"I really hate rating a restaurant based on service alone because the food here is good, but....

Ok this is review is a 3 Star ONLY because of the employees and the service. This is my third time coming in here and this place does serve good food! 

1st visit: I ordered their BBQ Pork and Chinese Sausage combo fried rice, but they told me they ran out of Chinese Sausage. It's 11:30 and they opened at 11:00.

2nd visit: I ordered the same thing and instead they gave me BBQ Pork with Fried Rice. Not what I ordered, but it was good. 

3rd time I visit and I ordered the same thing again hoping that I finally get to eat what I've been trying to order the first time. I ordered my food and 45 MINUTES LATER my food came out!!! I've NEVER waited that long for my food!"}
{"text":"It's been an hour and a half and still waiting for my delivery. I'm so mad I don't even want the damn food anymore."}
{"text":"Lazy night, don't want to cook? Order neighborhood Thai. For pick up only!

After reading other reviews, the restaurant should remove the delivery options. Haven't they heard of yelp? Stop making excuses and stop offering delivery. It feels like you, as a patron, are losing a service that ought to be offered. However, if you just knew from the start you couldn't get delivery, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. 

Onto the positive... I like how your orders are saved under your phone number. We get the standard, safe dishes like panang curry, pad see ew, tom yum soup. We've tried the basil chicken, drunken noodles, and papaya salad. Of those three, I would only order the drunken noodles again. There are much better basil chickens and papaya salads elsewhere."}
{"text":"I accidently found this place on Christmas eve. I am so glad that I did. The food was so good, service was excellent, the prices were unbeatable. Thank you for being open on that day!!!"}
{"text":"Well let's start I been a costumer from this place around 8 years at ready but today I came and I ordered panangan avocado (with shrimp) and they give me salmon instead when I ask the lady waitress about the mistake she gives me a face like u eat at ready from the plate and I told her if she could give me only my shrimp and she just got mad and grabbed my plate abruptly and she said is Gonna take a while to get a new one and I said I'll wait it's not my fault that they mistaken my order I just was trying to help and don't be rude but her response was absolutely wrong and no professional. I work on food business and i know what great customer service and what is not i should give like less 6 stars never ever came back to this place"}
{"text":"We came here on a Wednesday night and ordered 
1. beef pad see ew 6.95
2. house style tom yum with flat rice noodle 6.95
3. Sticky rice and mango 3.95
for $22

- Turn on Wynn Rd and park in the back. Small restaurant on the side. 
- We arrived at 730pm, and the wait time was 5 minutes.
- Tight seating. So close that I was wondering what show Carlo's Bakery is and someone replied Cake Boss. haha. 
- We got our order in very quickly and our food in about 10 minutes. 
- Pad see ew was average but for that price in LV, it was really good 
- Loved the soup. Not many Thai restaurants around here make soup like that. Noodle hose style. We got a 6/10 and it was still pretty spicy. Good to share. 
- Perfect for groups less than 4. 
- Not much mango. small slices. Sticky rice grains were a bit hard.
- Nice hole in the wall. China town vibe. Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Really great Thai food. I always just get the tofu pad Thai and coconut juice. Really delicious."}
{"text":"This is my to go place whenever I crave Thai food. Especially the Panang Curry, the spices and coconut based sauced is seasoned just right and pairs well with rice. Another dish I enjoy is the Pad See Ew, flat rice noodle with a soy sauce based flavor and Chinese broccoli and the option of protein or tofu. A great option from the popular Pad Thai that most people are accustomed to.

My only complaint I have is the customer service. At times the service is great and other times it's been lacking. A few times we have been ignored or the order is wrong. The management needs to take the initiative to communicate the entire staff on how to handle customer service. I have a few friends and neighbors complained that the posted time doesn't correlate to the actual operating hours. I still remember we were turn down at 9:28pm and the posted time was 10:00pm. The staff member on duty told us that the kitchen is closed. This is very misleading to the public and doesn't reflect a professional business practice. I recommend that you call ahead if you plan to arrive later in the evening. Overall, delicious Thai food at a reasonable price point!

2017 Yelp Review #84"}
{"text":"After seeing the good reviews, I thought we should definitely try it out so I came here with 2 of my friends for dinner.  We were in the mood for some asian food so figured we couldn't go wrong with this place seeing that it had 4 1/2 stars from 69 reviewers. 

 I had the Roasted Duck Noodle Soup, my friends had a Combo Beef Noodle Soup and Chicken and Shrimp Silver Noodles.  For an appetizer we had Fried Tofu and we each had Iced Coffee.  The Iced Coffee was probably the best part of the meal (unfortunately).  The Fried Tofu was just ok...had much better from other places,  It was a little hard and not smooth and soft.  My Roasted Duck Noodle Soup was ok...tasted like it had a lot of MSG in it though.  My other friend said his Combo Beef Noodle Soup was ok, but it didn't have enough beef.  And my second friend was a bit disappointed with his meal...the chicken was kind of bland and the dish itself wasn't too flavorful.

So overall, the meal wasn't bad...just not great.  I've had better Thai food but probably have had worse too.  Staff was friendly and polite though."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner around 7:30, and the place was empty.  A few people came and got takeout while we were there, and I wonder if others - never having been there before - think it isn't a sit down restaurant?  I don't know, but you can sit down and eat your food there.

I think this place would've gotten more stars from me if the portion sizes had been a little bigger, for one - they seemed to be on the small size for my taste; and also, there were only a few vegetarian options on the menu.  And... this might sound nitpicky, but... the vibe of the place is kind of bland for me, honestly.  There's nothing special about the way it looks or feels, which isn't something I usually complain about, but I feel like a lot could have been added to my experience if the place had a little more character.

That being said, the servers we had were friendly and checked in on us a few times throughout the meal, refilled our drinks when we were nearly out, etc.  So, good service.  And the food was good, as well.  Since most people get takeout here, you're likely to have the place almost entirely to yourself if you come here to eat."}
{"text":"This is my go to place everytime I think of Thai food!
Great food! Excellent service! And awesome pricing!
Must try place for everyone!"}
{"text":"we had to wait 45 minutes on Sunday at 7pm.  We had hoped that the food was decent enough, but when they came out, they were just OK.  We liked the fat noodle dish, the pad thai and the fish sauteed with vegetable.  The rest were a blur.
We like Lotus of Siam the best, and Pinkow better than this place.  It was worth trying though."}
{"text":"We arrived at 4:30 on Friday to an almost empty restaurant with 3 servers who need to brush up on the English language.  We asked several questions since many items were unknown to us, though we're very Thai-food-savvy.  Our server recommended the Three Flavor Grill Salmon which we ordered, along with the Pumpkin Curry with chicken, both dishes at $8.95@.  

First, the atmosphere...  the restaurant is large for an Asian one & the booths are painted bright purple, with unusual seating configurations.  If we had known before ordering that the radio was coming on with news, etc. we'd have made our exit.  Second, the rice... it was not Jasmine but a very cheap variety.  The silverware is for picnics & the small white plates are plastic.  

Third, the food... the pumpkin (butternut squash) was too soft and the sauce really tasted canned.  The other ingredients are what I dislike in Asian food, big chunks of white onion, carrots & green bell pepper.  As for the salmon with chopped chicken, it was very fishy & the sweet sauce tasted, again, like canned & not fitting for these ingredients (which also contained the onion, green bell & carrots).  No basil or other greens were on the plates.  And our server never came over to inquire how we liked the food & when we got to the salmon dish, called her over to complain about the very fishy taste.  No substitute was offered.

The menu choices look terrific & all prices are reasonable.  If you are, however, familiar with Thai food & have enjoyed it all around town, I believe you'd be disappointed here.  I think I've learned my lesson... if someone recommends a restaurant, I'll first ask how many times they've dined out on the particular cuisine, and where.  In the meantime, we're staying with our tried & true in Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"My friend and I picked up food from the Rampart location today and we thought the woman doing the take-out food was quite rude. When getting the food home we noticed that the crab rangoons did not have a bit of crab in any of them. We paid $8 for cream cheese filled pastrys that were not that great. The Thai curry saved the meal. It was the right amount of spicy, chicken was tender and delicious, and veggies the perfect softness. The chicken pad Thai was okay, but my friend told me it's not as good as The brown rice Thai kitchen. All in all, this place is okay, but didnt blow us away. We may order from here again because the price was right and the chicken curry was good, but we won't be ordering the \"crab\" Rangoons again. The reason I didn't give it 4 stars was do to the service and crab rangoons. If we have a better experience next time I may change my rating."}
{"text":"I'm glad we tried this place. My hubby ordered BBQ pork fried rice which was sooo delicious, I had the Tom Yum which was so delicious too hot and perfect flavor.  Place was clean and we experienced great fast friendly service and the Thai tea is soo good too.  I recommend this place for lunch very affordable."}
{"text":"Long overdue review of this diamond in the rough restaurant. We only stopped here because it popped up on maps when searching for Thai near where we were. I'm glad we did, though, because the food was bomb. 

We ordered a papaya salad, pad Thai, pad see ew, and beef jerky. The papaya salad had all the flavors I love - fish sauce, lime, chili, etc. and had just the slightest bit of a kick to it. It paired really well with the beef jerky, which was a mix of sweet and salty with just the right amount of chewiness. Both dipping sauces for the beef jerky were good, too. The pad see ew was one of the best I've ever had. The beef was tender, the broccoli still had some crunch, noodles were nice and chewy like they should be and the sauce had a nice balance of the sweet and salty, too. The pad Thai was delicious. The sauce was tangy and flavorful and there was plenty of it so the noodles weren't dry. A must order!

The place was pretty stuffy inside and the smell of the chili's cooking made its way out to the dining area, which made a few folks (and staff) cough a bit. The staff was friendly and the service was good. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Came here for a light lunch. Ordered the potstickers and the house special Tom yum soup with small rice noodles. The food was decent, the service was attentive, and it was a decent meal, but I wasn't blown away by anything. The potstickers were ok, they just remind me of the gyoza that you get at any Japanese restaurant, but smothered in sauce. The tom yum was not as impressive as I was hoping for. It had the tangy features that I love, but when I order spicy, I expect scorching hot. My taste buds did not even feel a tingle, but they do have all of the chilies on the side if you want to add some heat of your own.

The thing that shocked me and my food buddy was that I was the only Asian in the restaurant besides the food server. For once, I was part of the minority in Chinatown. weird..."}
{"text":"Great food, good price.  Some of the best phad thai ever."}
{"text":"This is one of my most visited Thai restaurants in Vegas for multiple reasons. The food is great for a really reasonable price. I think their Panang curry is super flavorful and that goes for vegetarian and meat added as well. I love their spicy basil leaf tofu, pineapple fried rice, and the pad thai and pad see ew -- which are pretty standard. I also really like their papaya salad + Thai beef jerky--probably the most winning items I have tried on their menu. It's got the right amount of spice and crisp on the edges, and the papaya salad compliments it well. I could go on and on because their selection is great and everything I have tried has not disappointed. 

This location has a good amount of seating and is cute and spacious inside. One thing to note is that it takes a bit longer for food to come out, so not so great if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that I discovered this place!!  It's going to be my new go-to spot that's just around the corner from my house!  I think this place is pretty new, because I haven't noticed it until recently.  Excellent food quality & prices.  The service is fast & friendly.  The location is very small, but extremely clean and very pretty inside.  Most of the soups are $6.50 - 7.  

I tried the pork & fish ball soup because of another yelper's recommendation, and I was not disappointed!  I love that they offer 4 different choices of noodles, as I opted for the flat rice noodle.  Other noodle choices include: egg, vermicilli, or thin rice noodle.  Be careful with the little spice rack they bring out, as a little spice goes a long way.  Without meaning to, I overspiced my soup a bit, but it was still wonderful.  I just ended up drinking a lot of water and nursing my runny nose while enjoying my soup.  On my next visit, which will be very soon, I plan to try the Tom Yum soup.  Honestly, everything on the menu sounds great, which offers a full array of Thai dishes in addition to the soup.  They do take out orders, but I'm not sure if they offer delivery."}
{"text":"Tried this place about half a year ago for the Seafood Tom Yum, and while I thought it was very good, it didn't leave enough of an impression on me to find me craving it regularly.   Last week I decided to give it another shot and ordered two other Yelp review favorites, the Papaya Salad and Duck Fried Rice.  My thought was I'd counter the unhealthy fried rice with the papaya salad and maybe eat half of each.   The best laid plans of mice and fat men....

Went and picked them up (service both times seemed a little rushed, but not unfriendly).   Prices are pretty standard. 

 Upon getting back to my office I went for the salad first.  I thought it looked really nice, but I didn't enjoy the flavor at all.  Now it must be said for the 50th time how much I typically do not like salad so maybe it's personal, but I found the bean sprouts in particular to have that dirt taste that they sometimes get.   Or is this the way bean sprouts are supposed to taste?  I love them cooked usually, but maybe raw they taste like dirt.  I didn't get any sweetness from the papaya and I ordered a 7/10 and wasn't getting much spice either.  Maybe I was eating it wrong.  Either way, YELP YOU FAILED ME ON THIS ONE.

But redemption comes in the form of Duck Fried Rice.  Holy Moly.  Toss that silly salad aside and dig in.  Now it doesnt seem too complicated:  take greasy fried rice, add a healthy amount of unhealthy, fatty duck and voila!  A star is born and a salad is forgotten.   Yeah that half and half plan earlier?  Chucked it in the trash along with the salad, and devoured the entire box of fried rice.  Cancel Dr's appointment for tomorrow and call it a day.

Duck fried rice - 5 stars.  Papaya salad - 1 star.   5+1/2 = 3.   I can do Arithmetic like Bill Clinton."}
{"text":"I really love it here the atmosphere is really chill and clean... The service is excellent and the food is sooooo exotic and delicious!!! This is definitely the go to spot for Thai cravings!!! It's also shockingly affordable And the Thai tea is on point!!! I'm probably gona come here every week;)"}
{"text":"Two words describe the food at this establishment \"The Shit!\" If you're looking for food that tastes as if Jesus Christ came back down to earth and made miracle food then look no further! Every bite was as if an atomic taste bomb was dropped in my mouth with flavor exploding in all directions covering all taste buds in a square mouth radius! Go here this is worth your hard earned dolla bills!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Just wish the waitress woulda given me more then just one cup of water during my meal. Seriously need to have a chat with their waitresses about customer service and how to check on customers i got a water before my meal and no refill untill she brought me a to go box. I have been a waiter before so i know first hand keeping up with drinks is the easiest part of the job, if you can't do that then get out of the food service buisness for reals!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall in LV Chinatown. (I didn't know LV _had_ a Chinatown, but they do!)  Thai BBQ pork is rare outside SoCal but delicious. Spice was just right.  I wanted a snooty Thai meal while in LV but  with food this good why pay more?  Cheap and Yummy, just off the Strip.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Very cheap Thai food
But worth and good food
I am always order delivery to my hotel cosmopolitan and they came quick with no fee charge.   Love"}
{"text":"What can I say this place has been my favorite Thai place hands down in Vegas food is really really good yellow cury and the pad Thai is Bomb .com I always get it a level 10 spice level o if u get Thai tea ask for large to go it's a super big cup ...."}
{"text":"We had the spring rolls,  yellow curry,  and Thai spicy noodle.  
All Delish.  
They were wonderful to make everything vegan for us. 
The price is also fantastic,  20$ for two of us to eat and we are very full.  
Service was fast. 

If your looking for a fancy date night this is not your place,  but a quick dinner our or take out this is the place. 

Spice ranges from 1 to 10 we opted for 7 which is leaving our mouths burning after our meal is done. 

We will visit again."}
{"text":"one of my favorite thai restaurants! it's pretty cheap (most items under $10), but the food is still great. if you go here, you have to order their duck fried rice, it is the best thing ever. I think they cook the fried rice in the duck fat, so you can really taste it. also, there's pinapples, which add a nice, light flavor to it. their chicken tom yum noodle is one of my favorites too. it's a simple tom yum broth with chicken and your choice of noodles. another great dish (if you're in the mood for spicy) is their spicy noodles (pad kee mao). it's stir fried spicy (your choice in how spicy) flat noodles with vegtables."}
{"text":"I really love heres pad thai noodle, its very sweet and spicy and price is very cheap, employee is so sweet i definitely comeback here"}
{"text":"Great food and not far from the strip. Definitely will visit here again. Seafood and papaya salads were great. Shrimp soup was great too."}
{"text":"Great Thai place if you're looking for quick take out orders! We had the chicken fried rice and chicken pad thai which totaled to $15! Not bad for how pricey some Thai places can get. The service was great from when we first walked in. Greeted cheerfully by the staff and asked if we were dining in or taking out. The chicken fried rice was delicious and light. It did not feel oily like how other Asian style fried rice dishes can be. The chicken and rice was seasoned well too. I ordered the chicken pad thai spicy level 6 (1-10 scale). Unlike other places where spiciness can overpower flavor, their take on it balanced both really well. The peppery heat from the spice came first with each bite, followed by the savory flavors every pad thai dish has. Similar to the fried rice, the chicken was seasoned well and complimented the flavors of the dish. The great food, friendly and quick service and the 5% yelp cash back are all the reasons I'll be coming back whenever I'm craving Thai food on this side of town!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because they deliver and they're cheap.  And they have great reviews on here!  

However, I have to say it's probably some of the worst Thai food I've had.  Maybe I just ordered wrong, I dunno.

Considering how many other Thai places are here in Vegas... more than you could shake a stick at.  I don't know what kind of metric that is really, is that like 15 Thai places?  I don't know how many places the average person could shake a stick at in, say, an evening..

But anyway,  I tried the Tom Yum that people have been raving about and I couldn't even eat it, I thought it was awful.  The Won Ton soup was also weak but I at least could deal with it. 

I got some noodles too and they were decent, but the Pad Thai was pretty lame too.

All told, I may very well order again because it's so cheap and convenient for delivery, but I'd rather go elsewhere. :/"}
{"text":"Not the first time I've been here. I order the same thing every time and this time it has become difficult to order.
My experience this time has left me less than thrilled as a returning customer to never return. 

I ordered drunken noodles
Pad Thai
Beef salad
Crab rangoon 
Combo fried rice
Side of Chinese broccoli tossed in a garlic sauce.

Apparently they want to charge you for a crispy pork but give you no pork and just the broccoli and rice with sauce for $8.50 when the steamed broccoli is $3.50?? So just so you understand the sauce costs more than the vegetable itself.. I don't want rice broccoli and sauce; simply wanted a side of veggie tossed in a sauce that's its, but that's not possible said the \"chef\"."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery (Chinatown location), it took 50 minutes for my food to arrive which is about what they told me (45min). 

I ordered Rad-Na with beef, crab rangoon, cucumber salad, sticky rice and a Thai tea.  ($27 after delivery and tax) Everything tasted good,  I had no complaints there, I was actually kind of surprised to be honest.  

But my Rad-Na had no meat at all.  I called the restaurant and told them I had no meat in my order. She began to ask how I mixed everything together because the meat probly fell to the bottom and that my order cannot be cooked without meat and so on and so forth. Like really!?! She insisting theres meat in my order when I have it right in front of me, looking at it. I'm not trying to get extra meat without paying for it, come on now.

She said she would bring me another gravy meat and  broccoli mixture, I insisted I only needed the meat but after another 50 minutes I recieved the whole gravy muxture with about 10 peices of thin slices of beef, I'll take it, it's enough to eat at least half my noodles. This is the 3rd place in Vegas that I came across that has been cheap as heck with the meat.  Like,  don't give me all these damn noodles and sauce if your not going to add the appropriate portions of everything your supposed to!! 

(3 stars Just because the food was good in taste and yelp doesn't allow half stars or it would have been 2.5)"}
{"text":"Friendly Staff.  Just expanded to the suite next door so now it is twice as big.  Still only about 15 tables.  Enjoy going there and doing take out as well.  I seem to order the Seafood Pad Thai almost all the time.  I have never been disappointed.  My wife loves the soups.  Good food at great prices.  Quality is consistant as the service."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times and honestly each time it gets worse and worse. This time I got the pad see ew and it tastes like burnt rubber, and the service was rude too. With plenty of Thai food spots in the area, why even bother going here"}
{"text":"Good food overall the service can improve personally expectations met but the other table had a misorder. Overall average dining experience. Love the thai iced tea and chowmein"}
{"text":"Tried the calamari appetizer was nice and hot served with a sweet n sour sauce great tasting. Just ordered shrimp pad thai hoping it's good. Pad thai os great I like a 5 medium hot.  Please inspect your food throughly as it may have some non food items. I ate around metal sponge string other people however might not want that in with their food.

1- clean nice environment . Too clean if you find a string for s dishwasher in your meal. 
2 - modern style restaurant seems new or remodeled.
3 not too busy in a Thursday evening 4 pm
4. Good food 
5 good service ."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town working nearby. Will eat here again. Top quality Thai food. I didn't order anything special - egg rolls, pot stickers and pad Thai. Pretty sure it's the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Came here on the first day I flew in. Their spicy food added another few degrees to the hot day. After eating here I left with more sweat that I came in with which I LOVE. Their spicy level is on point! I love having spicy food and I'd say spicier the better. For the love of spice they put in, I would definitely love to come back again."}
{"text":"Nice new spot for a quick lunch.  Good food,  very affordable,  clean inside and solid service. Worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I LIKE this place.  I sincerely like that it is a small no frills establishment with just amazing food and service.  I have never been disappointed here, truly love the Chef Specialty Menu, every item, it's all good!"}
{"text":"This place may be a little difficult to find but it's worth it! It's right facing the main road but easy to miss as you drive past Chinatown. We were looking for a quick bite, a little after dinner time and decided to check out this place. The hostess was a little concerned with us arriving half an hour prior to their closing time but seated us never the less. Another party arrived 15mins before closing and were turned away as it was too late, so please make sure you arrive with sufficient time on your hands. We were tied between ordering the duck noodles and the pork BBQ style noodles. The hostess said both were good and we ended up ordering the BBQ pork noodles. The service was very fast. The noodles were quite good, the broth was perfect and soo tasty! We thoroughly loved our meal and left with a big tip. Definitely bookmarking this for my next trip to Vegas. They have a lot of items I still need to explore."}
{"text":"Thai Style Noodle House has the best crab ragoon I've found anywhere in Las Vegas....and I've tried quite a few Thai restaurants in town. The food is consistently good and the food is always made fresh, modified to my request without question. TSNH is a go-to pick-up spot for dinner on my way home from work multiple times a month."}
{"text":"Thai Style Noodle House it some leggit, off the strip, Asian food. Was lucky enough to know a local who look me here for lunch, and I was nothing short of impressed. Walking in the place is nothing to brag about in a sense of atomosphere or ambience, however their food is something to brag about. Going with my trusty old favorite I ordered the Pad-Thai and much to my surprise I was VERY impressed. Just the right amount of spice, sweetness, and peanuty crunch! I also sampled the sweet and sour chicken that was also very amazing. When I am back in town I will be sure to swing back by for some great Asian goodness!"}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable...fried rice, Thai flat noodle with Duck, and the yellow curry is delicious!  However, they burnt my fried calamari :("}
{"text":"It's the middle of the Vegas summer.....and I see people waiting outside this hole in the wall establishment.....this place must be HOT! The thought of waiting in 110 degree weather to eat here is a stretch for me....but their noodle soup is delicious!  I've honestly never heard of a thai NOODLE soup before this place.  Upon entering the establishment at 11:30am....not even peak lunch hour...only one table was left.  The menu is extensive with the typical curries/fried noodles/fried rice/chef specialties...and a separate green menu with lunch specials. I decided to try the duck noodle soup with vermicelli upon a friends recommendation...think Vietnamese pho mating with Chinese wonton soup....and voila thai noodle soup (sliced duck, bok choy, bean sprouts, cilantro swimming in a herbal duck broth).   There are four noodle options (vermicelli, egg noodle, rice noodle, wide rice noodle) to pick from. The menu seems very extensive and it helps that the people working there are actually Thai.  The prices are very reasonable...under $7 for most dishes.   

But be aware small establishment means you may end up waiting for a table...and after waiting for a table...waiting for your food to come out.  Service was extremely slow today and refills of water need to be requested.  The servers were friendly, but just extremely busy.  I would definitely try this place again....as a heads up I was informed the sliced beef noodle soup may be even better than the duck noodle soup."}
{"text":"I've tried all 3 locations and this location wins best decor.  The food is pretty much the same at all locations with the two outside of Chinatown being newer and cleaner in appearance.  Thai Style is my favorite Thai spot outside of the pricier Lotus of Siam.  I think the options are a better value than say Archie's for the typical Thai fare, with some options you might not see at some of the more generic Thai restaurants. Some of my favorite dishes are the beef/pork jerky with this amazing sweet/salty/sour dipping sauce.  The Moo Tod (fried pork) over fried rice is also delicious, with the pork being fried with a hint of sweetness.  The pork comes over a heaping portion of fried rice.  It also comes with a bland soup...which I generally don't partake in...but I'm told it's a palette cleanser.   My new favorite find has been the Three Companion Pork, which comes with sticky rice, papaya salad, and either pork or chicken.  The papaya salad here is a refreshing option for the Las Vegas summer heat.  It's a blend of green papaya, tomatoes, green beans, and carrots sprinkled with peanuts.  It's a bit spicy even when I ordered it at a level 2 out of 10.  My nose was getting runny while eating it, but I kept going back for more until the dish was empty.  I like that Thai Style also offers duck as an option instead of just chicken/beef/pork.  The duck fried rice and duck pad see ew are delicious.  In the wintertime, I also enjoy the beef noodle soup.  The broth is a dark, thick broth with a variety of beef cuts and beef meat balls.  Most items are $7-9 for a large portion."}
{"text":"Rude service ever. I've come here numerous of times and never felt welcomed. This is my last time coming here. I don't like spicy food and made that aware to the server everytime I come here and I've never had an issue until tonight. I always order the panag curry zero spice but someone on my table also ordered it with a level 6 spice. I knew I'd have an issue as they would cook the sauces together and I'd be stuck with a spicy dish. And that's exactly what I got. I told the server and she got offended and was extremely rude to me. She made a comment asking asking if we've ever been to the restaurant before and we told her we've come myliplte of times and I always order this with zero spice. She then said that she never saw us here before and that this dish is always spicey no matter what spice level you tell your server. In my head I'm like why ask what spice level of it's going to be hella spicy anyway AND I've had this exact item multiple of times and it's never been spicy. But I just ignored her rudeness and didn't finish my food and she still charged me for it. I'm so disappointed with the service here. This was the mini female with short hair. Rude."}
{"text":"Some of the food is good but their service sucks. Never checked on us and it was a mission trying to flag the lady down just to pay for our bill and to get a Togo box. Plus it's a super tiny place, it's not hard to check on us. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Almost forget what I had but their food are fresh and tasty, restaurant wise...I guess you cannot say much about it when you were hungry and getting late at the evening."}
{"text":"Been to so many Thai restaurants.. This one has a very unique taste to their food.

Curry, not so over bearing & everything was great. Place may need a touch up here and there but its a good size and its clean. # 4 on the papaya salad was a little too spicy but many choices within$6-$12/ dish.. Thats a treat! A gem in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Small place with a good food, Parking is little problem here, price is cheap compare to other thai restaurant"}
{"text":"All time favorite Thai restaurant I bring my family and friends here and recommend it to anyone who like a good Thai place it is so good and the prices are so reasonable"}
{"text":"We still love coming here as our Thursday ritual after the kids are done with their activities. Mainly, it's a 2 minute drive from where we are coming from and by this point we needs-ta-eat. It's not fancy, not grimey...perfect dining setting for our party of 6. We never ever have to wait for a table here especially because of our party size so that's another reason why eating here has become our ritual. While I still love their food and price point...I will have to say we have clearly seen a slight change in their food. My husband has been ordering the spicy Thai noodle (fat noodles) the past few times in a row because he lies to think what he is getting served was just an off night. Safe to say that isn't the case. He's been griping about why he doesn't get baby corn in it. Lol. The past 2 times he's poked his fork around in disgust because he notice that the veggie-to-noodle ratio is well, damnt...I such at math. Why did I even bust the ratio word out. Hahahha. Okay seriously though, his dish looks more like a stir fried vegetable plate rather than a noodle dish with vegetables. 

We ALWAYS order the Thai fried rice and I swear the past several times its either lacked in flavor and/or on the oily side!! They used to serve it all nice to us...throwing coriander leaves on there, etc...but the serving size looks like it has reduced and no more pretty garnishments. Honestly, those garnishments whether it was a part of the dish or truely meant to be a garnish helped made the dish taste even better. 

My beef soup I would order used to have fried garlic sprinkled, enough bean sprouts and baby bok choy to make me feel veggie satisfied...but again, it's like they're skimping us short. Havent had the garlic in it in awhile, sometomes i dont even think there are any bean sprouts, and the flavor has definitely lack as well. We come here weekly for the past few years so we would know for a fact if they have started to change up ways. Considering we have been coming here for a few years and only of late have we noticed a change...I wonder if they have a new cook, on a budget cut, etc...

Bummer. I loathe when that happens. Anyway, we will still be coming in until we seriously have had enough and get fed up. Even with those new gripes, I'd still recommend giving them a shot."}
{"text":"Lunch specials looked good but orange chicken was 75% batter. Maybe 2 ounces of meat. Egg drop soup tasteless. The staff was very cold and not friendly. Food was just okay."}
{"text":"So I used to go here a lot

1- because it is close to work
2- it has decent authentic Thai cooking
3- reasonably priced lunch menu

 today.. I decided to order for delivery. I called at 11 (right when they opened), ordered my food, and the lady said there was going to a $2 charge for delivery because they charge $1 per mile. I don't mind paying it but across the street is not 2 miles, Google maps says the place is 0.4 miles. Then on top of that they said it would take 45 mins for the food. Why? You just opened.. It takes about 10-15 to cook it, and its only 5 min drive to the office. 

Instead of convenience, I'm now going to make the drive down the street to another restaurant."}
{"text":"Great prices, friendly service. The have Lao style too if you're into that kind of thing.

Nice locals spot. Pro tip - no parking in front, you park around the corner on Spring Mountain. No worries though. 

This is basic and clean and good food with good portions. Highly recommend. 

Was here for dinner on a Monday and nice little crowd. A/C workee real well too. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My love and I had their thom kai soup. It was an enormous bowl of goodyness. Great place. The restaurant isn't that cozy, but that's kind of normal in Asia. The food was amazing and so cheap. Definitely recommend when you visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"get the tom yum noodle soup! it's frikin amazing! not as sour as other tom yum soup, it's a perfect balance of sweet, sour, tart, spicy, & hot. i also tried the thai beef salad & green curry too, not bad. oh, get the large thai iced tea! it's $2.99 and it's HUGE and so goood!"}
{"text":"I am here a couple of times a week for takeout - amazing noodles and coconut juice!  They have great customer service and are always accurate with their takeout orders.  The chicken pad-thai is a must!"}
{"text":"I eat Thai food pretty often, we were looking for a new place to try and decided on this one for its great reviews. First off the person answering the phone for pickup barely spoke English and didn't understand us trying to order a pick up. Then they said it would be 15-20 minutes and when we headed over at that Time we still had to wait. The food wasn't even ready.  After another 15 minutes it's ready so we left. When we got home to eat the food mine was not great- I had the pad see ew. The noodes felt like a plastic material and the sauce  was off. I personally wouldnt eat here again even I just for that reason. 

It's also in an awkward location so unless you live next door don't bother making the trip. It's pretty north west a random parking lot in the corner. You probably need to know where you are headed as well."}
{"text":"3.7 I was really looking for a great Thai place on our new area, this is a maybe. The prices are pretty cheap on the menu, but the sizes are pretty small. We go to another place on the other side of town that is about $1 higher but you get 1/2 a portion more. 
The flavors were pretty good. I think the best deal of all we ordered is the seafood wonton, $9.70 huge bowl loaded with seafood, noodles, wontons and veggies.
We left hungry, not a good thing. 
As I read reviews from 5 months ago I wonder if the new remodel have anything to do with portion size. Because they are not big by any means."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Thai food. I don't normally like Thai food, but this was awesome!"}
{"text":"Service And ambience is good. More imortantly, the food, good, not the best, but the portions are big- definitely need to share. not a 4star b/c no ETOH is served."}
{"text":"Best papaya salad ever! Their duck fried rice is very good too. I'm a little disappointed with their Tom yum soup, but their vermicelli noodle in the soup goes very well.(u can make a choice what kind of noodles you want)."}
{"text":"Their food is SO GOOD! specially for the price!! I always get the pad thai and the coconut soup with the shrimp in it. All other items I've tried have been great too. The service is extraordinary. I think the owners run this place. Love coming to this place :)"}
{"text":"Solid Chicken Pad Thai.
Not so fast service."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I can say that they are pretty consistent in food and service.

It was a late Friday night, so there weren't that many people inside, so I sat right away. They took my order and the food came out within 10 minutes.

I ordered the pad see ew, which is the flat rice noodle with Chinese broccoli, egg, and a sweet soy sauce. I enjoy this dish, had flavor, and the fried tofu was fried to almost perfection.

Not to mention this place also has good prices and the portion they give for that price is very good."}
{"text":"I am a regular here so Idk how much that effects the overall outcome of my experience, but I would recommend the Khua Kai noodles and their roast duck soup is my favorite in town."}
{"text":"This place was good and I would recommend it. I ordered the Chicken Fried Rice & Shrimp Pad Thai. The rice was pretty good, in my opinion it was kinda dry and didn't have much flavor. I had to add a lot of Soy Sauce. Those are the only things it was missing. Now the Shrimp Pad Thai was amazing! Flavor was good & very well cooked. The only thing I didn't like about it was that the tails were still attached to the shrimp which made it a minor struggle to eat, but that's the only thing I'd change about it. I definitely recommend the Shrimp Pad Thai and adding Chili Sauce to it makes it even better. The service was good and I'll definitely be going again."}
{"text":"We had the crab fried rice, Pad Se-use which tasted like chow-fun, and  a chicken dish that me with Ricky rice and pickled radish and carrots. I bought these specifically because other Yelpers highly recommended them. We were disappointed with the lack of flavor. I even bought the sticky rice with mango and thought it was lacking sweetness. The ices coffee was premade but tasted Ok. The service was good, the place is very small, maybe 8 tables, and the food came out quickly. If you like food on the bland side then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, 3 years has gone by since my last visit year and what a difference! I came here again to get their roasted duck noodle soup with the small rice noodles (you can choose flat noodles, vermicelli, etc). And boy it has changed! The roasted duck is now sliced thinly and it doesn't taste that fresh. The noodles were the same and delicious, but overall I felt that the quality has gone down.

We also ordered the Thai satay chicken skewers and it was just okay. At times, the chicken tasted dry even with the peanut dip. Overall, I don't know what has happened. I was really disappointed because I came here to get some good comfort food before leaving Vegas. Service is decent and the place can get crowded during busy hours, but I just hope things can change. Maybe I'll come by again...or maybe not."}
{"text":"Sooo ridiculously busy tonight!! I think word has gotten out. This place was already crammed, now it's packed to the gills and the two servers can barely keep up. I think it's time to hire more help and get a bigger place."}
{"text":"Never had better tom yum soup, papaya salad and chowmein! I absolutely love this place! Highly recommended for vegetarians!!!"}
{"text":"I gave this place 3 stars because they have bomb ass food but they didn't get 5 because the service is just so bad. Pretty rude, but the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I came here on saturday night almost closing time, i ordered the large thai tea. The reason why i just got thai tea is because my friend bought a large thai tea to go akd it was huge ! So ordered one too, and it was very cheap came put to be $3.47 exact. It tasted different and way better from other places. Im willing to come back and try their food since its really close to my friends work at truvape, same plaza."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Food was excellent,  and the venue is clean.  I suggest the Pumpkin Curry."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall eatery. The portion size is unbelievable and the dishes come out piping hot and ready to devour.  Great service, attentive wait staff and plenty to chose from on the menu."}
{"text":"Ordered from this place  many times. Try pad thai with shrimps, duck fried rice and potstickers. Good food."}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite Thai place spots. I just stumbled upon this place because I was craving Thai food. Looked up Thai restaurants nearby and boom! :) The aura / design of this place is pretty clean and simple. Looks like they're still trying to redecorate the place. Looks really good though! So, I had ordered dinner to go and the lady who helped me was extremely helpful and friendly. Their pad Thai is awesome, and chicken wings is super yummy and crispy too! Awesome find for sure."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high after last years rave reviews, or perhaps the business has gotten so confidant that their patrons would go back no matter what. This place has severely disappointed my gf and me on our recent visit this winter.

We got there and it is busy as usual since it was lunch time. Servers seemed stressed and distracted, but I won't rail them for that. We sat down and got our menus and it took forever to take our order (10-15 min). We ordered a Tom yum noodle soup and sticky rice. Note that we came in first and got our order down first in front of three other groups who sat down after us, yet they got their food first and ours arrived last after 10-15 min. Maybe they treat their regulars or Thai people better??? 

So my Tom yum noodle soup was just what I expected, but the sticky rice was horrible. First of all sticky rice should be soft and easily chewable, but our sticky rice was hard to chew and majority of it still had rice uncooked!! Raw rice in our dessert? Wtf! So my gf went to the cashier to ask about it, and her response was \"no that's how it is supposed to be\" in a rude tone. I'm sorry, but we have had sticky rice from many Thai places and I have friends who are Thai that I have asked and they all say that it is not supposed to be raw! 

Servers are completely incompetent and rude. Total disappointment especially after our first few visits. Maybe they should hire that girl who first helped us and made this place our first thing to visit when we go to Vegas."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai here is amazing! Best in town by far, ask for chili sauce on the side but be careful cuz it's HOT!"}
{"text":"Luckily most Thai food in Vegas is good to excellent and this Thai style noodle house is decent but could step it up a bit by, for example, using better quality jasmine rice and sprucing up the decor - seats and tables are flimsy. For a quick fix or take-out, you could do worse, but with all the competition around (5 other Thai restaurants within a 2 mile radius) it's hard to argue that this particular spot will keep me going back."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places!  I will definitely be returning when I come back to Las Vegas.  Great portions at a great price.  This place was easily one of my favorite meals in Vegas.  My family and I headed here after seeing the first showing of \"O\" at the Bellagio.  We thought it was too late, since it was already 10pm.  Good thing they don't close until 10:30 because it was well worth the wait.  We had a feast!
NOTHING was mediocre.  Here's what you gotta have at some point...
- Thai Iced Tea
- Papaya Salad
- Tom Yum Kai (w/ Shrimp)
- Pad Thai (w/ Chicken)
- Thai Spicy Noodle (w/ Beef...more like steak! :) aka Pad Kee Mao or Drunken Noodles
- Crab Fried Rice
- Roasted Duck Curry -- so good with addition of fresh pineapple
- Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice (BEST EVER!!)

** A word of caution, when you ask for a medium level of spiciness, it's gonna be pretty hot because medium Thai = super hot for most Americans.  My tongue was on the border of being deliciously numbed."}
{"text":"Omg, the chicken coconut soup is amazing. We got this a ton over the winter and it always hit the spot. The only down side to this soup is the amount of lemongrass stems still in the soup. They are totally inedible so you really have to work your way around them but other then that it's a great soup. 

The servings here are closer to a tapas style size so try and order some dishes that you could share among the table. We normally order the soup along with a beef and broccoli and a a spicy chicken dish for two and we finish off most everything, we like food!  The Beef and broccoli is a little greasy but it has delicious flavor. The coconut soup takes the cake though. Get it."}
{"text":"I haven't tried the tom yum yet, but according to all these reviews maybe i should start. 
This place is ABSOLUTELY awesome! hands down my favorite Thai place all over Nevada. I say that because i go to school in Reno, anyway that's a little irrelevant. 
This place is pretty small, but the quality is great and also authentic. Some of the dishes i have had were pad Thai, curry, papaya salad, duck fried rice crab fried rice and basil leave fried rice, also chicken satay. Let me tell you, they did not at all disappointing me! Especially all the types of fried rice, you have to try all of them. My personal favorite is tied between duck fried rice and basil leave fried rice. Always super tasty and just... pure goodness. 

I got some today and i ordered level 6 spicy. Honestly i thought it was a little bit too spicy. I don't like it when i have to stop eating something due to the spiciness. because then all i taste is the spicy and not the food. SO maybe a 5 would've been great. 

But it was really delicious and the price is affordable. They are also super fast at take out! (of course i only ordered 2 dishes) but yeah, i definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The lunch specials have a choice of 1 or 2 entre choices. $5.95 For one choice or $7.95 for 2 dishes. I had the Mongolian beef and the cashew nut chicken. It was ok. Nothing special. I have had a lot better. The Mongolian beef was really tough. Very low quality meat. The cashew nut chicken was bland. It had about 5 nuts. I may go there again as I always give two chances to get it right. But with that said I will not make a special effort to do so. 
The service was not good. I had to keep asking for a refill of my ice tea. It was not busy and my waiter was just standing around. 
The prices were good. It is the only reason I have them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Tried this place out because of Uber eats. The prices are great and so is most of the food I've gotten from there. 
Foods that I've had and liked: 
Beef Pad See Ew 
Orange Chicken 
Kung Pao Chicken 
Thai Coffee 
Fried Rice 

Only thing I had and wasn't a fan of was the chicken panang curry. The sauce was watery, and the chicken was tiny strips that have a weird texture and there just wasn't much of it. It was mostly just water sauce and rice. It wasn't horrible, but I want order that again."}
{"text":"My mom was craving wonton noodle soup so I took to yelp and ended up here. The soup was lukewarm and not very tasty. My mom was pretty disappointed. I ordered the seafood salad and thought the dressing was too sour for it being with seafood. On top of poor customer service the waitress was pretty rude with us and beware, they're very cheap with paper napkins. We had a spill so asked for an extra napkin and it never came...probably won't be back to this location. What a bummer."}
{"text":"So if you want an authentic experience enjoy this place. Great food great prices. Amazing noodles..."}
{"text":"The food was really good. The restaurant was a little dirty and the customer service was not good at all. The brought the food out in parts. They didn't take our drink order until the food was delivered. I do not know if I would be back."}
{"text":"Thanks to the yelpers for reviews and tips.  This place is small but the food was beyond my expectation.  Duck fried rice was as good as they say, duck curry was thai as expected, and the pad thai was tasty and fresh.  For lunch and a bargin price, i will be back"}
{"text":"It is hit and miss at this restaurant.  While the Chef specials are good, the appetizers and soups leave something to be desired.  Thai food is better than its Chinese food unless you're choosing take out.  Gr8 menu selection and efficient service.  Casual atmosphere and  decor.  Good value in Summerlin for some fast Thai food.  I like the ginger steamed snapper spiced half spiced and the salmon dishes."}
{"text":"They have such amazing food! I haven't had anything I dislike there. And they always greet us and the kids, since we go there so often. The soup, beef jerky.. I recommend. The orange chicken is out of this world for a kids meals.  The curry chicken, spicy but I eat it every time. Cleans out my sinuses but well worth it"}
{"text":"Another Mom and Pop place in China town! Went with a friend this past weekend and we ordered two dishes each. We had a total of 4 dishes on the table!! IT WAS A FEAST!! Annnnnnd, it came out to about $32 total. WHAT A STEAL!!

We ordered the following:

Tom Young Soup: Not a big fan, but friend said it was very good! I tried a taste of it for the first time and it wasn't for me. It did have a good balance of sour and not sour though. 

Crab Fried Rice: Really good. Trust me on this one! I will order this one again. If you like dry fried rice instead of sticky this is for you. 

Spicy Flat Noodles: It was I expected, but very good! Flat noodles are by far my favorite kind of noodle.

Duck Fried Rice: I wanted to soooo badly love this dish, but it was just too sweet for me. It was cooked with pineapple, and the duck they added was fatty. By no means does fatty mean bad, but it's not for everyone. Wouldn't order this one again. 

Overall, I would go back for a bite to eat. Can't beat price, food, and atmosphere. Will have to show my parents when the come visit. :)"}
{"text":"My friends and I read all the great reviews and decided to give it a try. It was awesome! The papaya salad (be warned that even the medium spicy order was very very spicy) and pad Thai were especially good."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure why this place has such good reviews. 

Everything was just... Average. Food was okay. I had the pad Thai and it was lacking flavor. My friend ordered a 10 spicy level food and it was more sour if anything.  It wasn't even that cheap. It should have been $$."}
{"text":"Second time to Thai Style Noodle House, and second time of being filled with delicious food! I really enjoy coming to this restaurant when I come to visit Vegas. It is indeed a little gem in the city of Las Vegas. I feel like at times, people who come to Vegas forget there are other places in Las Vegas than the Strip--perhaps even more tastier foods out there like Thai Style Noodle House that is no overrated and over priced.

For my second visit, I ordered a Thai tea (yummmmm!) and rad na. All fresh, hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Service....eh...not so great. The atmosphere....Sophisticated Minimalist decor. It really was pretty nice. My 5yr old son enjoyed it. 

This was my husband and son's first Thai experience. They both really enjoyed the food. We ordered Chicken Pad See Eu, Bbq pork wonton soup, and fried chicken over fried rice. Everything was great. The fried chicken was a sweeter version of chicken katsu. It was delicious. I do have to say that the restaurant serves soda from the can. It's weird. I'm assuming refills aren't free. We decided not to find out and had water as well. Overall very good and great prices."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the portions have gotten so small it's not worth the money coming here anymore.. used to come here all the time but they've cut back on portions ... barely any meat in the dishes and the lunch special is so small I'd rather pay 2 dollars more at Archie's and get a MEAL than a couple bites... very disappointed since this was one of my favorites.. will not be returning."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best! Chairs were dirty that you sat in that should have been a sign! Servers we're both rude put out if you asked for anything such as water refill or clean plate! Overcharged on the food we ordered and the food was very bland! Spicy eggplant was good mixed vegetables with chicken horrible with no flavor!
First time and last time! If you want the best Thai food in town go to WEERA on west Sahara"}
{"text":"Best tasting and affordable Thai place in the city. Try the fried rice. Really good Thai tea. Nothing on the menu is more than ten dollars."}
{"text":"Not bad Thai. The lunch specials are priced very well. Tasty."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's at a good price, service is great, and food comes out fast! I recommend the pad see ew! Go ahead and try it!"}
{"text":"This is probably as good as it gets for Thai food in Vegas.

We arrived just before it got crowded. It was a Saturday, and right at 12 noon the place filled-up and there was a crowd waiting outside the door to be seated.  98% of the people in the place were Asian - which tells me right away that it's pretty damn authentic if the locals eat here.

Their soups are fabulous and come in VERY large portions. I couldn't finish my soup it was so big.

A good value for the money as well. The decor inside is very sparse and utilitarian but it's about the food here - not the ambiance. 

Go before noon or after 1:30 if you don't want to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"They don't even deserve this one star and I wish it were possible to give negative stars cause that's how disappointed. When we came in we were not greeted by anyone, stood around for 5 minutes, when we went to seat we wait over 10 minutes and didn't even get a menu. The service was horrible and the food worse. Everyone agreed that the food was too salty so we probably won't go back here!!"}
{"text":"My first 1-star review...  for a place that received an average of 4-stars, and upon our visit had line waiting out the door.  Here is the chronology of what happened:

We initially went to Pam Real Thai just a mile over based on the review.  Looked really interesting, but alas, it was closed because they were only open for dinner.  So we looked up this place on Yelp and decided to head over.  First impression good, there were a couple of party waiting outside for a table for this small joint.  About 100 degrees outside so not too pleasant, but looking forward to the food.  We put our name in for 2, but there was a party of 9 in front that they said would need to be seated first.  No problem.  We wait about 10 minutes, and the big party goes in to get seated.  In the meantime there were a couple other small parties that came around, but we didn't pay attention too much.  Another big party of 8 comes, puts their name in, and waits.  10 minutes or so later, the party of 8 goes in!  I go inside to check out what's going on, and the small parties that came after us are also seated already!  So I go over to the counter and ask them when we were going to get seated, they look at the \"wait list\" and our name is still on it, with people below us crossed out!  What the heck?  They realize, say \"oh\", and says, \"sit over there\" and points to the empty table.  No apologies, just a point of a finger.  Man, food must be really good here to tolerate this, I thought.  We later witness that there is another party getting a similar treatment so notching this one as an inefficient system that has got to get fixed.

Service does not improve as the meal goes on, however.  We flag the server down to order our drinks and food, never got served water, and they never checked up on us for the meal.  Onto the meal.  We ordered a Thai Iced Tea, Thai Iced Coffee (no difference as Vietnamese one), Yellow Curry, and Spicy Fried Rice.  In general, everything was good.  But both the curry and rice was too salty.  The dishes were plain, no garnishments, and smaller in size to justify the cheaper price.  So not necessarily a bargain.  Tea was good, no complaints, coffee was typical.  So overall 3-stars for the meal.  If it wasn't so salty, the curry would have been great.

So throughout the meal, the servers never approached us, we called them EVERY TIME.  To order, to ask for anything, to ask for the check.  That gets a zero in my book and I let the tip speak for that.  I pay for the food, I tip for the service.  Servers should always remember that, I don't care what you get paid.

Table-for-1 Factor:  They had lone diners, so it is fine.  Whether they can accommodate you..."}
{"text":"Two words: coconut juice. This sweet addition complemented the spicy potstickers (so yummy!) and savory pad see ew perfectly. Everything we ordered was delicious and enjoyable. I often order pad see ew but this was the first time my SO wanted to trade entrees with me. He had the pineapple rice which was great as well. Overall, this is a good option for Thai food in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love there food and go there once a week but one employee has ruined my whole experience very rude lacking customer service skills. I called to place an order and she argues with me about a dish I've been getting once to twice a week for months I no longer will visit this location EVER."}
{"text":"I was really impressed by the service in this little dump :) 
Why are they even serving water from tap when all the employees drink only bottle water ???? WHY!!!!!!
I had vegetarian Tom Ka .. it was average I would say .. I've had way better and even tho I've been here many times won't return .. tired of average stuff :)"}
{"text":"Not bad at all at very reasonable prices, generous portions and quite authentic to the source. to my demise there is nothing to complain about...and I live(love) to complain...
ok..one complaint...why is there no \"soup no mai\" on the menu? yes I know it smells like feet..."}
{"text":"The cheapest Thai food in town, and also the tastiest. Greasy, yummy, flavorful and spicy Thai food just like you like it. 3 things ordered for 25$! Crazy."}
{"text":"Thank you Vegas Yelpers for all the lovely reviews!

I'm always searching for new hot spots. I was craving pad thai... my new found love... and came across TSNH.

First off... I love the location since I live right up the road and it's in between my commute to work and home. 
I'm all about reasonable prices! My meal was under $10. 
The portions were big... I ended up taking home half of my meal.
I went around 9pm and my fellow yelp las vegas elite/friend and we were the only ones there... so seating and waiting for our order wasn't an issue.

Cute hole in the wall... casual indoor seating.

Only thing I wasn't a fan about was their angel hair noodles. Pad thai noodles are usually bigger in size. Taste was decent but I've had better pad thai here in Vegas.

Would I come back? sure! If not for the pad thai... I wanna try their thai fried rice with chicken (since pad thai and fried rice with chicken are my only thai things I like).

If you're in the area and craving thai... stop by TSNH!

-Miss Yelp 2011"}
{"text":"Our service was fantastic(our waitress was absolutely adorable) but after hearing from the waitress that NOTHING is fresh- its all pre-processed frozen food, I was really disappointed. We had already ordered. The Pumpkin Curry is pretty good... But I have had much better Thai. If you want fresh, incredible Thai- Naga is the only way to go in this state. Save yourself from a greasy belly ache :("}
{"text":"Authentic Thai place! Everything was good. The Thai coffee was a little too sweet but te Thai tea was perfect!"}
{"text":"The one thing I will say about this place is that it is consistent.   This is my boyfriend's favorite Thai restaurant when basing the food for the value and at first I didn't like it too much. 

But over time I've changed my mind because the food is always consistent.   I never have to worry that when I come in the fried rice will taste different or off. 

There are some standout dishes that I think are great here.   The beef jerky is really good.   The fried chicken over fried rice is amazing.  I also really like the pumpkin yellow curry. 

The ladies who work here are very nice as well.   They are patient and always smiling.   I never run out of water here. 

The food also comes out very quick and nice and hot.  Very tasty and worth a trip in."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night around 7pm. Its a small place, located on the Wynn Road side of the shopping center just east of Chinatown.

I've eaten at the one on Rampart and thought they had pretty good food. Here we chose the following:
Crab Rangoon - 4/5
Edaname - 3/5 - a bit soggy and not salted much
Chicken soup with coconut - 4/5 tasty but not much chicken
Beef Pad see ew - 3/5 - not as tasty as the Rampart location or other Thai places.

Overall, service was good, the girls did a great job. Company was good. Just the food wasn't all that, and for that I probably won't return because so many other good places to eat in this area."}
{"text":"Went here with my thai friend for some noodle soup. This used to be the old L&L Hawaiian place, which I believe is now located in the old Diner car on Buffalo. I miss that diner, it was good food.

It's not a huge place, but its very clean. There were about 4 tables occupied. One waitress, and one person in the back cooking I believe. I decided to go with the beef Pad See Ew (I can never spell this right). My friend chose noodle soup plus a thai meal she said she can never find here. Don't ask me the name LOL. Later she said it was just OK. My Pad See Ew was really good, sweet flavor on the noodle without that bitterness that sometimes accompanies this when the noodle is overfried. 

I will come back, and I will try some other dishes. Easy, cheap cost, good food, good service. A winner in my book for what it is."}
{"text":"Q: How do you spell Delicious cheap fulfilling food? 
A:  Thai Style Noodle House

duck rice and beef noodle and rad na.  ALL solid choices.  

i'm used to asian beef noodle soup, and this place makes their beef noodle soup complete different.  its not as liquid as regular asian restaurant.  but its delicious nonetheless.  

the duck fried rice was bomb.  i didn't get to try that much, and my memory was fuzzy (its vegas, if your memory isn't fuzzy then you aint doing vegas right)...but from what i remember, it was really good. 

the rad na was really good.  it was thin fat noodles covered in chicken and thai gravy.  super fulfilling after EDC 2011 day 1. 

if you're drunk or hung over or in the mood for delicious cheap food, come to china town and go to thai style noodle house.  i promise you will not be disappointed.  money back guarantee.

I scare myself sometimes.  i have dreams that i just drive from socal to come here and eat, and then head back.  YEAAAA, its that good."}
{"text":"The foods good, but they need to be able to accommodate customers better. For example: I would like to add meat for my fried rice and don't mind to pay extra (obviously), they should be able to do that, no?? It's extra money. Wth?!
And another thing, when I called at 9:39 PM to pick up some food to go, knowing they closed at 10, but apparently I can't, because they're already closed the kitchen... so yeah alls I'm saying is that if it wasn't because of the food and the location so close to my home, I'd never come back. And you need to consider these things if you want to create more sales and more returned customers.."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed with this place. My finance and I decided to grab some Thai food tonight. So of course I search Yelp and Noodle House 4 was on the list. I've been to the one on Fort Apache numerous times and I've never had an issue or a complaint. Well this one really ruined it for all the Noodle House spots. 

So my fiancé orders the jungle curry with no meat just veggies. The waitress asked him how spicy from 1-10 and he specifically said 2. I even made fun of him for choosing a 2. He does not do well with spicy food. I order the Pad Thai and ask for a level 4. I love spicy food but tonight I was going to take it easy and just do a 4. 

Our food arrives and guess what?? My Fiancés Jungle Curry tasted like a 10. He started coughing from just breathing in the broth. So of course I had to test it out because what's spicy to him is not to me. He wasn't kidding...I mean his meal was even way too spicy for me. It was inedible. How is it that his food was way more spicy than mine and I ordered a 4?!? I call for the waitress and I explained, she then sends over this guy so then I explain to him. He looked over at me and asked me if I eat spicy food. I replied \"yes, I eat spicy food\"! I told him I ordered a level 4 in spice and my food isn't even  close to how spicy his is. The point is my fiancé ordered a 2 out of a 10 and his meal was over a 10. 

The waitress said he is going to bring some of the broth to take down the spice. Umm okay. How about you replace his inedible meal? We are not asking for a refund just food we can actually enjoy. So instead he brought hot water or some kind of broth and sugar?? No joke. See photos attached. How can you even think that's okay as a business owner?? This restaurant isn't going to make it. I'm sorry to say but you're competing with thousands of  amazing Thai restaurants in Vegas that would never treat a customer this way. Be kind to your customers and they will be kind to you. I wish I could say good luck but I don't think that will help."}
{"text":"Having read the reviews before I went here, I was surprisingly disappointed. 

The one star is for the poor customer service, the food is nothing exceptional. The first thing you notice when you walk in us that is smells like bad breath! Eeeew! Should have been our first red flag!

We were a party of four on a Thursday afternoon and the place is small and crowded. Waited for a hostess to seat us and was told 10 minutes to wait for a table when they clearly had a clean table for four ready in the back corner. It was very awkward standing in the doorway as people came in and others left. A waitress gave us menus to look at while we stood in the entry way. About the same time a single man (who came in after us) was seated at the table for four that I mentioned earlier. WTF. Really?!?! 

We waited and were finally seated. The menu was greasy and had lots of misprints and old prices scribbled out with new prices written in. Not very professional or appetizing. 

The waitress was rude, slow and acted like our request for a side dish and chop sticks was a big inconvenience. The food was basic and boring. No real flavor. Who the hell serves mayonnaise on potstickers??? The Pad Thai was a small portion and half of my plate was just a huge handful of bean sprouts. The dish does not come with rice here, like it does in every other Thai restaurant in the world. Skimpy. 

I do not recommend this place to anyone based off of my experience today. We won't be back. So many other places nearby that truly respect their customers and deserve repeat business! Yuck!"}
{"text":"They never failed me. Food was delicious! I always ordered for pick up and they always have customers, the wait time is pretty good about 10 minutes, just right fo my commute or while checking out from Smith's. 

I tried all their curry, love them all but I like the red curry the most! Then the uber delish Pad se-eu and Pad thai. I kept coming back!! They are also open daily, a big plus!"}
{"text":"Definitely a hole in the wall place that deserves a lot of recognition. Came here after a long day of hiking, and boy did the food really hit the spot as far as healthy and energizing goes! Their menu is colorful with a lot of variety of foods that are vegan/vegetarian friendly, or otherwise tasty and nutritious in its own way.

Heed warning to the level of spiciness they ask you (which can be found throughout many other reviews here too!) I learned my lesson with the papaya salad that medium is blazing hot in Thailand's culture. Despite how delicious the papaya salad was prepared, not even halfway through my taste buds were on fire and my lips were feeling like they were seared off! Lesson learned with that, but the papaya salad was still fabulous, as well as the pot-stickers (the sauces really compliment the appetizer just right!)

My favorites were the Red Curry Chicken and the Thai Tea. The Thai Tea is a MONSTER, they serve it to you in a huge mug and if your food has a little kick, the Thai Tea is actually a good remedy to cool down your taste buds! This place is very small in size and I hope they will expand it over time, but this has to be one of my newfound favorite places in Las Vegas and the Chinatown area to venture!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It is cheaper than most Thai places, but the quality is excellent. The only issues I have is that the larb salad could use more lettuce, and sometimes the heat levels are not consistent. I would highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I ordered the papaya lao style with spicy level 7 and beef larb spicy level 7, pineapple fried rice, beef noodle soup spicy level 7. Too my surprise, the papaya was not spicy at all, nor the beef, nor the larb. The papaya was good, not spicy at all. Beef larb had too much lemon and they can only cook well done. I would not order this again. The beef soup was ok. Nothing special. I've had better pineapple fried rice. This restaurant is hidden."}
{"text":"All I eat is the beef noodle soup! You have to try it! It's a large portion and it always tastes the same. A very consistent place. Most servers are friendly but there is on server that should not leave their home lol"}
{"text":"This place was a surprise find. I love how small and intimate it is. I only moved to Las Vegas a couple weeks ago and I've had the yellow curry with chicken twice already. It's super yummy!

I'll be back soon to satisfy my Thai fix."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this small thai noodle house, decided to give it a try based on reviews.  Upon initial arrival the size of restaurant was small , but definitely determined to try something new than the usual restaurants near by.

The food was flavorful and cost was cheap.

Definitely an overall good experience."}
{"text":"We order the crispy noodles with seafood and I order crispy noodles with chicken and pork it's the best you can find anywhere it's reasonable the.... presentation is wonderful and it is a total 10 delicious the servers there are very friendly we just love the place...in fact we are going back today for lunch...this will be 3 times this week"}
{"text":"Spacious and modern interior, very nice and neat.
Mongolian beef is very salty. Beef is not tender, and you can't taste anything but the soy sauce.
Roasted duck, the broth is on the sweet side. Feeling impressed at the first sips, but got tired of the way too sweet taste and can't drink more. 
Wonton is big but juicy and flavorful. 
The highlight of the whole meal is the shrimp rolls which are perfectly deep fried, thin crispy wrap and a fresh shrimp inside!"}
{"text":"The food here is terrible. If you want to go to Thai style noodle house go to the one on fort apatche. This one is so dirty and the service is bad. The water taste like toilet water and the seafood smells unwashed. We ordered a Tum yum noodle seafood soup and the seafood smelled unwashed. I paid and didn't even eat my food. The pad Thai taste like it was made with ketchup. The shrimps on it were so small. Probably one of the worst meals I ever had in vegas and I have lived here for over 12 years. It was just dirty."}
{"text":"A friend actually suggested Veggie Delight, but while looking over their lunch menu I noticed this place next door and opted for thai instead. My bf has never tried Thai food (this kid doesn't like vegetables OR spice) so it took a bit of coercing, but luckily in the end he really loved it. 

I'm totally down with any restaurant that has an extra complete vegan/vegetarian menu, so they get an extra star just for that. 

I got the spicy thai basil and asked for extra carrots and it didn't seem to have much more, but the dish was good nonetheless. Yummy sauce.

My bf got the jung pao tofu and the sauce was incredible. Luckily he doesn't like onions so I ate them all and even snuck in a piece of tofu that was really yummy. 

For dessert I usually get mangoes with sticky rice, but this time we went for the fried bananas; a little too greasy for my taste, but wonderfully paired with the ice cream and honey.

I would go here again and I would recommend it to someone who wanted chinese/thai that was cheap and off the strip."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB. I always order delivery from here and it's ALWAYS good. Pad See Ewe is amazing and I love the chicken noodle soup."}
{"text":"Talk about heaven in your mouth! Lol.

My fiancé and I were having the classic argument about where we wanted to eat. 

I like Vietnamese, he hates Vietnamese. 
He likes Chinese, I'm over Chinese. 

Fast forward 20 minutes later driving around in circles and we both agree this is our stop. 

The food is affordable and the portions are large! 

They have a few spots around town. Definitely giving this place a 5 star rating, it's so good!"}
{"text":"3.5 rounded up.  I'm always satisfied when I come here, which is every time I come to Las Vegas.  The thing is that with all the good restaurants in L.V., it's hard  continue coming back to the same place.  The Pad See Eow was the last thing I had, and it was very yummy."}
{"text":"I have been doing take out since they opened and  the food is decent and by my house . However, I dined in and they are the laziest waiters ever. They don't listen they cop attitudes if you want water or anything . I will never dine in again !!! Bump them I'll rather dive further for better service ."}
{"text":"This is my go to place whenever I'm craving Thai! The prices are acceptable and the food is delicious. Crab Rangoons and shrimp padthai will always be my favorite. Customer service is awesome, I've ordered delivery from them once and it came at a reasonable time. No complains so far, I will keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the restaurant.  It is on the smaller size with only 10 tables and tables are pretty close together.  The service was prompt and friendly.  The waitress was very patient as I asked a few questions about the menu as I have a peanut allergy and inquired into the ingredients of some of the dishes.  The food was served very quickly. Our appetizer were the vegetable egg rolls.  They were pretty much what we expected.  Most likely deep fried from frozen pre made.  I ordered the shrimp and chicken with silver noodles.  It was very good with a nice mild sauce.  There was no need to add any other seasoning or condiments to the dish.  I am looking forward to returning to try more dishes off the menu.  Definitely worth a visit plus the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from the Bay Area and have been to Thailand more then a few times. TSNH serves exceptional Thai food. It's nothing for decor. Food, folks and service.
Thanks Ling Ling!"}
{"text":"This place is like McDonalds deciding to be Bachi Burger but still charging the same prices. It's delectible. It's totally hole-in-the-wall, the kinda place I love and want to transport to Montana with me. 

For $35 including tip and tax, I got Chicken Larb, Beef Pad See Eu, Green Chicken Curry, and Chicken Tom Ka. All were fantastic with large portions. The green curry had a potent seasoning (probably an herb that I'm not used to) and so it wasn't my favorite but it was still so excellently prepared. The Chicken Larb was crack, the best I've ever had. Tom Ka and Pad See Eu on point. 

All created within 15 minutes, with fresh herbs, galangal and veg. I'm jealous of those who live so close to this place. I love Thai food."}
{"text":"There's just something about seeing a papaya salad filled with chillis in my friend's plate that always makes me smile. I personally can't eat his \"Can I get anything above level-10 spicyness?\" 

We ordered the \"go-to\" plates: Pad Thai with Chicken and Duck Fried Rice, both were delicious, although I didn't enjoy the cinammon-y taste of the duck. 

The Orange chicken dish had a good amount of crunch, and good amount of sauce where it didn't become my new lip gloss for the afternoon. 

It is a small locale and parking could be a doozy due to the crowds of Spring Mtn. Road but overall definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh/authentic and cheap Thai food, this is the place.  The food is very good. They have a lunch menu which is a good portion and comes with a side and soup! I recommend the orange chicken and noodle bowls! 

The only bad thing I can say about this place is that it is a very small space and it's very crowded at times. Also, there's a funky smell."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp pad thai and veggie egg rolls for lunch.  The egg rolls and the sauce that was with it was yummy!  The pad thai was disappointing- the noodles were clumped together, the egg was undercooked and there were too many sprouts for my tastes.  While I waited for my order I thought it was a bit gross that the girls were busing tables, bringing out food, finishing food off with toppings, and exchanging money all without washing their hands between duties. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Best Thai ever! I cannot find Anywhere as good as this place! Wish they opened one in California! Staff are so sweet and remember what I order when I come in, Tom Kai with no lemongrass lol. Hands down best Thai"}

{"text":"Came here while we were in vegas over MDW because we totally didnt trust the thai places in Henderson. Small place, food was whatevers. I got a thai style seafood noodle dish that came with a good amount of seafood. Bf got padthai, both were whatvers... spice level was on point. Waitress was nicee."}
{"text":"This is not your typical Thai-themed restaurant with the obligatory portrait of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, pictures or paintings of the Floating Market, major temples (Wat), hanging shadow puppets or classical Thai dancers or elephants.  This is a no frills Thai food restaurant, that is decorated with t-shirts sold to tourists visiting Thailand.

The food served here is not refined, but is delicious and comforting. I would describe it as the food one might expect to be served, when tagging along with their new college freshmen best dorm buddy (who is Thai, instead of the Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese ones I actually met back in college) going home for the weekend, with or without the nearly obligatory 2-weeks worth of laundry for mommy to wash.

The service here is excellent when we visited this past Sunday.  It wasn't too busy when we arrived, and the waitress took her time to recommend the various dishes in each section of the menu to try, plus the specials they have posted on the wall by the t-shirts.  I opted for the Chicken Khua-Kai Rice Noodles (even though I really wanted to try their Pad Se Ew) and the portion was decent, and it hits the spot. My friend ordered the Yellow Curry (I like the flavor of the curry and it wasn't too spicy and will probably try it on my own in a future visit).  We also shared the Fried Shrimp Rolls appetizer, that came out piping hot with the Thai Sweet Chilli Sauce, I didn't really care for this appetizer and will probably not try it again in the future.

Price-wise I was expecting it to be a little less, but I am sure their rent is not cheap, and they must charge enough to make it worthwhile to stay and run their business and continue to serve comforting Thai family cooking to locals and out of town guests.

My rating thus far is 3.6 stars (rounding up to a 4).

P.S.  Now that it is summer, I wonder if they have the traditional sticky rice with mango dessert?  Man I love those!"}
{"text":"I like this place always good never had a problem here . Except it just isn't close enough to my house it limits the times I go their."}
{"text":"THE BOMB.

stumbled on this place quite by accident. (kind of. used yelp to find it after realizing a place my friend wanted to go was closed.)

ATMOSPHERE. it's kind of hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for. passed right by it because it's on the side of the strip mall. once inside, expect -super cramped- quarters. basically, you might be bumping elbows maneuvering your chopsticks with the patron next to you. hope you showered today.

CUISINE. hella goodness. hella goodness. i've only been once and didn't try to cram my face full of everything. everything we had was good though. when they say thai hot, they mean thai hot. it goes on a scale of 1-10. i imagine 10 means it chemically removes the roof of your mouth since 7 was so hot my friend was pouring out electrolytes.

PRICE. woah. it's unbelievably affordable. two dishes and a drink -- with a generous tip = $20. you can tell it's affordable. there are like... broke kids in there on dates -- not dutch either.

SERVICE. since the place has limited seating, the service is actually quite good. they're fast. you order; it shows up. you're practically sitting in the kitchen so they don't have far to go.

OVERALL. this is now one of two places that i MUST VISIT when in vegas, the other being ichiza (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ichiza-las-vegas)."}
{"text":"Excellent foods!  I had vegetarian Yen Tao Four soup and a thai iced tea with coconut milk.  I was soooo full after eating that I couldn't order dessert.  The waitress was really nice and we got our orders super fast.  I can't wait to go back and try some of the other vegetarian dishes they have."}
{"text":"Great food.. Super cheap! This is our new place to get delivery for work from now on."}
{"text":"Hello Hello Hello, it's right here, yea, here, I want to say the best Thai restaurant in the states, so far. Only happen to visit once for my Vegas trip, but already dare to say they are good, like, real good. 

Knew it right away when I got in, the homey-look? that's where you'll find the real authentic food instead of the fancy one which usually will give you the american-style, it's a blah I know. 

So yea, I just wish I could go back there again, someday, yea?

I believe I had their Pad se-eu, nicely made. 
Hey, it's a big 5 stars from me, check them out guys!"}
{"text":"30 years of Thai food in Vegas. This one is very close to home cooking. The only thing  missing is the original PUD PED PLA DUK(Crispy cat fish in curry sauce). The cooks could not give me the answer why it is not on the  menu but they will add it soon
. Someone said they are thinking of  opening  2nd one. Archy's did  it  and let the original place dies(death and gone forever)). I hope they are not going down the same path."}
{"text":"Having been to other Thai Style Noodle House locations in town, I knew pretty much what to expect and was pretty excited to have a location closer to me.

The restaurant is cute. Very modern and spacious. So far I have tried the shrimp and avocado panang and the crispy pork and basil dishes. The panang was perfect. Creamy, the perfect texture and flavor. The servings or rice were really generous. We first thought we were sharing the one they brought us and then were surprised when they brought us another plate. The pork with basil was amazing too. Spicy and great flavor. The veggies were crunchy and perfectly cooked.

I'm so excited about this new location and I can't wait until they start offering delivery."}
{"text":"I never have understood the appeal of this particular location. I'm a regular at the Fort Apache location, but on the few occasions I have been here, the service was lackluster and the food was meh. 

After my most recent visit, I can say I will definitely not be back. My fella and I came by late one night when I was craving some noodles. My fella suggested Fuku Burger, but I was adament about my noodle craving so we ended up here. I ordered the spicy noodle and my fella got the duck fried rice. I also ordered a Thai tea for good measure. The tea was overly sweet and way too creamy. I handed that to my fella to finish. Next came our noodles. They weren't nearly as spicy and the texture was a little slimey. I wasn't a fan of that. My fella's fried rice was dry and really lacked flavor. 

To top off a very blah meal, we saw a roach wandering up the wall towards our table. EEEK! I've never jumped up so fast in my life. We quickly headed to the register. Pointed out our discovery to the waitress, paid our bill and left. I really didn't want to stay any longer than I needed to. I have a serious aversion to bugs.

I have to say that there were quite a few bugs outside in the parking lot, so I assume our little friend wandered in through the door, but still. Ew. I'll definitely stick to the other Thai Style Noodle House from now on."}
{"text":"Good food, quick service, unbeatable price. My favorite dishes are the tom ka soup and the duck soup."}
{"text":"My experience here was horrific. The service here is terrible. My green curry was so salty, that I had to ask for them to fix it. When they brought it back out, it was still salty. I asked again, this time I asked if I could exchange it for red curry. The waiter said,\"No, I can fix it again.\" The third time they brought it out; they just added coconut milk and it wasn't even spicy anymore. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"Love the tom yum soup with shrimp and pad tai shrimp as well 
Enjoyable service.  
Started playing football games on the tv"}
{"text":"When I lived in the neighborhood, this was my go-to for pad thai. The service is always fast & friendly and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Last night, I saw Paolo D.'s \"check-in\" to Komol, and I suddenly had a ridiculously crazy craving for their Herbal salad.  If I was pregnant, I would have made my husband drive to Komol just to pick up a week's supply. Unfortunately, I am not pregnant and due to my crazy soccer mom schedule I can't drive their myself. (I barely have time to write this review!) 

Anyways, I was still craving some Thai food so I settled for Thai Style Noodle House for lunch since it is minutes from my own.  I have been here twice, ordering take-out both times.  The restaurant itself is decorated really cute.  but take-out is just so much more convenient for me.  Some of my favorite items are Pad See-eu with beef, Green Curry with chicken, and the Panang with avocado and shrimp.  These dishes are full of flavor and the spice levels are just enough to clear my sinuses and make me sweat/ glisten.  My kids enjoy the chicken chow mein (i know, i know...that isn't Thai food).  There is a good amount of chicken and veggies that they will actually eat!

The items that I did not really care for were the Beef Stew noodle soup and the Chicken Larb.  They were flavorful, however it was just too salty for me to eat more than 2 bites. I chugged my Thai iced tea in seconds, and chased it with a gallon of water. In fact, just thinking about it is giving me a salt headache.

** Note: some reviews state that there is no restroom. There is one around back.  It isn't inside the actual restaurant, but there is one.  It isn't the most convenient location, but there is no need to torture your bladder. **

The service is quick and friendly, the price is very affordable, and it is around the corner so I'll definitely be back.  (at least until Komol starts offering delivery!)"}
{"text":"What a great find, amazing Thai cuisine at prices that seem too good to be true, compare to other quality Thai eateries. Lacking in service a bit but then I guess somethings gotta give :-)"}
{"text":"Little cozy Thai place. I had the pad thai and my friend, the pad see ew. Pretty good. Parking sucks though."}
{"text":"Thai heaven .... The food is delicious... Enuff said. I thought i had to go alllll the way to spring mountain location but not no more.. Awesome that they are here and the place is   Busy."}
{"text":"Can't get anyone on the phone to place a pick-up order. Doesn't matter how good the food is if you can't buy it!"}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch coworkers for lunch. Ordered a Thai style noodle. Chicken was not very dry but could be cooked better. At this point I would have rated the place an average 3 star. Then a friend ordered a large Thai ice tea, and it literally came in a soup container!  adding one star for taking our orders \"literally\" lol!"}
{"text":"I found this Thai place by searching for nearby Thai restaurants and it was a huge success. The ambience of the little place is modern and chic, with personal touches of hand painted art above the booths. The food was amazing. I had the Spicy Thai Noodles with beef and my friend had the traditional pad Thai with chicken. It was all delicious and the flavors were spot on and exceeded our expectations. The staff was super attentive as well. Give this little gem a shot the next time you crave Thai food."}
{"text":"I was shopping in China Town right across the street, they had fish for like 89 cents a pound and it was mid day so I was really hot, n I was going to stop some place to cool down n take a break, I thought of going to Volcano bona place, but then I saw this place in the corner of my eye, and I have add, so I decided to try something diff. Since I have been to Volcano before, they are really good if you ask me. The place is small, walked in looked @ the menu, and decided on the larb beef salad. Total with tax was 7.55. I had Larb Salad before @ this place in Austin Tx. and it was to die for. but this salad was pretty small for 7$, and very plane tasting. It had a decent size of meat in there compared to the rest of the salad but for 7$ they could ad more veggies @ least. Veggies aren't that expensive, and put better dressing or something. I doubt I will be back here. Total loss 8.55 cause I tipped the waiter. They waiter filled my water, n it's not his fault the food sucks. The people there where decently nice. IDK maybe I'm just a picky eater compared to the rest of Vegas, in my opinion good food in VEgas is VERY hard to find unless your spending 50$ @ a fancy casino buffet. Which is why I usually cook @ home cause I can't find what I want else where. Austin Tx. and Los Angles have much better food. Good thing I am moving to LA June 1st."}
{"text":"This little restaurant right across from China Town Plaza has some of the best Thai food in town. With only 8 tables, it is really hard to get a seat here, but once you sit you will understand why. With food made fresh to order and with the best ingredients, it's hard not to want to order everything on the menu. The Thai Noodle House delivers too! Oh and their prices are pretty reasonable also. One of my favorite Asian restaurants in all of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Tried this place on my last day in Vegas. A little small but amazing food. Got the Panang curry. They asked me how spicy on a scale of one to ten. I said 8 and it's making me sweat but in a good way. Delicious. Will definitely come again. Vegetarian friendly too."}
{"text":"This little hole-in-the-wall is a nice getaway from the strip. I was surprised to see how small of a place it was when my friend took me here and it had a nice homey feel. I come from an area with a lot of options for Thai and still was impressed by the food that was service and the wonderful service they provided. The portion sizes are perfect especially after a Vegas food experience (when you're already bloated) and the price is just right. I would say it's about a 3.5 based on what I ordered, but I'll round it to a 4."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and was surprised that they had one on this side of town. Came here for lunch with some friends and it does not disappoint despite the difference in location. 

I love how cheap the food is and everything was great. I went with what I usually get which is the S9 3 companion chicken with papaya salad and sticky rice. It was close to the price of lunch which is still great. 

One of my friends ordered this crispy noodle dish which was really good. She's a regular so they also brought out extra noodles for her because she likes to take it home and make another meal out of it. For the price of it and making it into two meals I thought it was great. Next time I will come back for lunch and try a different dish. 

Overall, the ambience is the same as the other locations. Nice and Asian feel to it. The bathrooms were clean and the service was great. I definitely will be coming back in the future."}
