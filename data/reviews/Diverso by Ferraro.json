{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch before a show at the Tarragon and wow, what a pleasant surprise! Awesome food, generous portions, great service, and an affordable price added up to a tremendous lunch. I'd go out of my way to visit again!!"}
{"text":"went back to another delicious birthday dinner for my friend, all wonderful pizzas (recommend the pizza romantini with whole wheat) delicious pasta, and beautiful birthday cake slice for dessert, have nothing negative to say!"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch prices! I got a Fettuccine ala Romantini for $10! It was an endless pit of pasta! It was simple and delicious and had goat cheese in it! A great place for lactose intolerant folks like myself :) 
I will try their giant plates of salad next time I go!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and had walked by a number of times not really thinking it looked like our type of place.  Last weekend we decided to give it a shot and were pleasantly surprised. 

The pasta special was a squash ravioli with a very nice light cream sauce and excellent flavour.  The pizza was very good and desert was also good.  We found their wine recommendations and service also very good.  This is a place we would totally recommend."}
{"text":"Diverso is a surprisingly good restaurant considering that it is located in the basement (or to be kinder, 'garden suite') of a building on sort of a barren stretch of Dupont.  

The first time I went, I had the margherita pizza.  The crust was really really good but I found the flavour of the rest left something to be desired.  The menu said that it was served with fresh herbs, but the herbs were actually dried and applied in very small quantities and the pizza wasn't very flavourful. That being said, the margherita is the most boring pizza on the menu and when I tried a bite of my friend's that had gorgonzola and olives, it was much more interesting.  So I would say that the pizza is good not great, although it might be pushed into great territory by some of the neat toppings they offer.

The reason I'm giving this place four stars though isn't the pizza but the pasta!  I went for a second time on Friday and ordered the gnocchi in a tomato cream sauce and it was AMAZING.  Fantastic consistency and flavour complemented very well with the fresh parmesan and hot pepper oil our awesome server provided us with.  I will definitely be gong back to try the other pasta dishes.

Another thing I'd like to say about Diverso is that the service is great.  Both times I went, I was served by a man who I think is likely the manager or owner.  He was incredibly helpful, attentive and friendly, really made us feel welcome.  Our food arrived quickly and at 13/entre was a good value.

Diverso is worth checking out!  The interior is surprisingly bright and modern and they have a good selection of beers (including a few small breweries).  Oh and the food is good too :)"}
{"text":"The pizza crust is really good, and the service is pretty good.  The rest is pretty bad.  They low-ball you on the ingredients (crappy olives out of a can, for example).  The price was a little high for what we got.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Nice space, exceptional service and the food is pretty good. We had the beef carpaccio, which was excellent, a spring mix salad (also very good) and two pizzas - the capprese with hot peppers and sausage, and the Giuliana with portobello mushrooms and red peppers. They were good. I wasn't as enthusiastic about them as my friend was, but they were decent and I loved the thin crust."}
{"text":"Good food, great and personable service. Treated my daughter and wife like a queen & princess (which they are)."}
{"text":"My first experience at this restaurant was a few weeks ago. My coworker and I were curious as it just opened.

I ordered a goat cheese chicken salad, which was very yummy - not overloaded with vinaigrette and very fresh.  Since then, I went back and ordered the veal parmagania - it was to die for!! The next time, I ordered a stone oven pizza with eggplant, asaparagus and zucchini.. It was nice and thin, perfect balance of veggies and cheese.. and in whole wheat!!  The gnocci is homemade from the nonna Ferraro - the best gnocci in the city!

I am very glad that this restaurant opened in the area, as it is very convenient for me from my work.

Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place several times and finally decided to go in tonight with my dad who was visiting. The layout of the place is a little odd, but the service from Robert (the manager, I believe) was great. However, we went very early, so it wasn't at all busy.

Everything was fast and delicious...with one exception. The olive oil and vinegar at the table were awful. But I can easily put that behind me given the quality of the rest of the food. Definitely worth a look!"}
{"text":"This restaurant appears to be closed.Too bad as Dupont needs some more restaurants like this."}
{"text":"Divsero is my favorite lunch spot by Dupont!

Their Pizza Marco ($10) is amazing!  It contains tomato sauce, mozzarella, goat cheese, grilled chicken, grilled eggplant, pesto, and fresh herbs & spices.  When I am there, I ask for their homemade spicy sauce and use it for the pizza.  What a great combo.

Their Daily Soup ($4) is great too.  Each time I've had it, I've liked it.  Yes, it changes on a daily basis."}
