{"text":"Its definately a local bar. When I decide that I cant muster the energy to go downtown, and pay full price for a dirty pint glass, surrounded by beligerant 50 year old locals, I will probably be that 50 year old local, whining about my state of affairs. The most absolutely predictable bar around, its only saving grace being its fine eye, or irish luck for good music, as the bands here often put on a show. Grab a pound of wings, and listen to some crooners cover a guess who track, and just remember that you probably will never be back here."}
{"text":"Now it is called... PEOPLE'S CHICKEN (wtf?) http://www.yelp.ca/biz/peoples-chicken-toronto#hrid:YGZBLotKKLNmdiXZYaBSVQ/src:self"}
{"text":"Known by some as Toronto's official \"Cougar Bar,\" I was first introduced to Chick N Deli many years ago while visiting from out of town.  When I moved into the Yonge and Eglinton area a year and a half ago, I was delighted to find that this place was still alive and kick N and, more surprisingly, so were the regulars!  I've been back a few times since moving into the area and it's been a sufficiently good time that I'm cringing while writing this, in fear that I may be spilling my neighbourhood's best kept secret.  The bar lives up to its reputation - the demographic in here is distinctly over-40 - but without the stigmatic, lecherous, cradle-robbing one might expect at first blush.    My friends and I keep going back for the music.  It's a pretty good variety, with a lot of 80s and 90s delivered by live bands on weekends (can't speak for weeknights).  The bands are always very talented, the volume is kept reasonable and the crowd is not the type you need to worry about getting into fights with.  A totally danceable scene even if you're, say, me."}
{"text":"Who would have thought....With an 8 and a 1/2 month old child this does not look like the ideal place to visit so we tried take out.  Not bad at all! You get pretty good chicken wings and a juicy hamburger without the expense of tipping and well tedium of having to watch HOCKEY! :) No offense to the canucks.   Although the previous review said the wings are hot, well not for me. We got the HOT wings and well they were tasty but not HOT as I define HOT. But then again not too many non-Koreans spent there twenties in Korea eating super SPICY food. So if your are Korean or you love HOT HOT food maybe the suicide wings will do it for you."}
{"text":"***CLOSED FOR RENOVATIONS***  To reopen Fall 2011   ****Edit: Reopen Aug 22nd, 2011 all newly renovated. Looks pretty sleek inside, and out. It's now called People's Chicken: \"http://www.yelp.ca/biz/peoples-chicken-toronto\""}
{"text":"This is one weird place.  It is in every respect an \"all comers\" bar.  Many of the patrons look like they just stepped off the set of a Kim Mitchell video.  Unless you live no more than a block away, I wouldn't bother making the trek."}
{"text":"When I moved to Toronto in 2007, I started inquiring about the whereabouts of a Dixieland Jazz Band I used to follow in the early 1970's when I was in Toronto. I used to see them at the Brunswick House, while it still was a dive. The name of the Band was the Climax Jazz Band.  To my great surprise, the Band, with very few personnel changes is still together and playing their energetic Dixieland at the Chick n' Deli. almost every Saturday from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.  They are as 'tight' as ever, a lot of fun and are followed by a crowd with a very broad demographic. If you like Dixieland, this is the place for you to be.  The food is OK and the wings a bit better, but its basically a Cougar/Sports Bar type of place the rest of the time.  Good fun!~"}
{"text":"If you are under 40, don't expect to pickup.  However, the tunes are pretty fun especially if Orangeman is playing which seams to be once per month or so.  They perform covers do well that if you closed your eyes you would swear it is the actual band. I must reiterate though. TOTAL cougar bar."}
{"text":"Stay in Toronto long enough and eventually, someone will say to you, \"You've never been to Chick'N'Deli?  Get your coat.\"  Well, such was my experience.  You can't miss seeing the place, it's got a huge rotisserie chicken above the street-facing sign.  It's got to draw you in, truly.  Firstly, the wings are good.  They're meaty, covered in a flavourful sauce and if you're into the hotter side of things, you'll find that it's a tasty heat, and not a hot-for-hot's-sake hot.  So, that's that out of the way.  The d√©cor is sports-bar-ish, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  It provides a bit of excitement, a bit of electricity to the place.  Oh, and when you go in, one of the first things you'll notice is a large empty space in the centre of the room.  That would be the dance floor.  There's music pretty much every night of the week there from Blues, to Jazz, to, erm, Karaoke.  Pick your nights to go carefully."}
{"text":"So, people actually like this place?   I went there for about 15 minutes on a saturday night. It was PACKED. There was a band playing old songs and these 40-something guys and ladies.  Nothing against 40-something - I'll be 40 something in 10 years, and I really enjoy disco music.   But I think the problem is the place is so terribly packed you can't breathe. I asked for a tequila and decided to go somewehere else. And oh, I couldn't move without being stalked by the regulars - I felt like \"fresh meat\".  Really don't like this feeling.   I paid the tequila directly to the waitress - so, no lines or waiting for the bill - and left."}
