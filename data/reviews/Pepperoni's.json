{"text":"I stop in Pepperoni's EVERYTIME I vist the 'burgh! Absolutely amazing food!  Try the lunch special!...stuffed banana pepper, huge meat ball, and a perfect fresh slice at a great price! All pies are great, and hogies are above average as well!"}
{"text":"A great place for a family dinner or date night.  One of my easy non-fancy favorites is pizza and salad.  Pepperoni's is wonderful-great food and great service.  It does get a little busy on Friday and Saturday nights but the wait is never long."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local pizza place in all of Pittsburgh. The Sicilian is excellent, although it does take a bit of time to get to your table because of baking time.  Other menu items worth checking out are the grispelli (not sure that I spelled that right), the salads, and the hoagies. Really, you can't go wrong.  The dining area is very small (8 tables or so), but outdoor seating is available when the weather is right."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Broken oven - offered a fountain soda for my 1 hour delay on take out, still not ready. Left with a partial PAID order."}
{"text":"Though there's nothing fancy about Pepperoni's, the food is excellent.  The pizza crusts are just the right thickness and texture, the cheese is a bit tough just to make it perfect, and their meatballs are excellent;  make sure to try the wedding soup, as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here all the time. We love there food so much that we even had our daughters baptism party there. It's a house that has been turned into a nice little pizza place. Good food good service and good prices."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good food, but pricey. I love the stromboli. We had a baptism party here, the people are wonderful. Personally, I like the pizza from Mm Mm Pizza and Luciano's better, but the atmosphere inside Pepperoni's is clean and warm. I'm only docking a star because it is more money than I'm willing to spend on a pizza dinner.  You can bring a family here and feel like it's a family dinner.  While I said I like the flavor at Mm Mm and Luciano's better, there is no dine-in facility at Mm Mm, and Luciano's is a basic pizza joint. Pepperoni's is a small Italian restaurant that just happens to specialize in pizza.  I'd definitely go there again."}
{"text":"This was such a neat little place and the pizza was amazing! Also the service was very friendly and helpful. Our server really seemed to care about our opinion of what we thought of the food. Also he got me a new glass when I dropped cheese and pepperoni in my coke... Whoops! This quickly became my favorite pizza for the area. I can't wait to go back and take friends and family."}
{"text":"\"A Unique Family Pizzaria\", exclaims the menu.   I agree!  Stopped by for lunch between appointments in the area.  A nice little house was converted and the inside nicely painted and decorated with a high ceiling and upstairs window letting the more light in.  Hardwood floors and walls with ivy painted around the windows.   An outdoor deck, but not at this time of year.    The place was crowded with some families, young kids and mother's, business people.     Homemade soup, wedding comes in a huge bowl and is very good. Pepperoni's has lunch specials and the pricing is amazing.  Soup, salad (it is huge), and bread sticks for $7.99,  or two slices of pizza with one topping and a drink for $5.99.   Homemade sauce for the pizza.  The menu also has Hoagies & Sandwiches, Salads, appetizers,  Calzones, and Pasta with homemade sauce, and homemade deserts.   Managed to get a few bites of Neapolitan style pizza and it is very good, too.  They do make Sicilian and deep dish pizza, also."}
