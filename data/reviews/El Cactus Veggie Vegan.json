{"text":"Oh, so good! We heard this just opened right down the street from where we live and had to try. Still a little rusty with the decor, but the food and service are excellent. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is Delicious!! They have great variety and things I have never heard of lol I tried the Calabacitas with \"Chicken\" and it was great!! Good portion size, and great flavor! Hidden and tucked into old Henderson, but worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that you only find every five or 10 years, and go wow! Great service, delicious food.  It has a humble exterior but more than makes up for it with the great food and service."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE GOT THE YUM YUMS.        My friends and I ventured too this restaurant on only its 4th day of being open so upon entering we were a little confused as to whether or not it was even open yet, but it is, trust me.        The inside of the restaurant is quite large with plenty of wide open space full of tables, booths, and even a little stage area! With so much empty real estate there is quite a lot of potential on what they could do going forward!      The menu is very exciting!! It contains more than just your simple \"whatever kind of meat, in a burrito, taco, torta etc...\" That you would expect from a Vegas Mexican restaurant. There is actually quite a bit of intriguing dishes that I didn't even know existed which in my opinion gives my adventurous pallet a reason to keep coming back.      I tried the Picadillo, Tacos Asada y Pastor, flautas con papas, y Nachos con chorizo and they were soooooooo good. Each dish had a lot of vegan meat!! (More than they give you at Panchos, not a diss btw because that place is good too) And the flavors were rich and dense!       Since this place is virtually right down the street from me I will be returning regularly until I've tried everything they make... and even long after I've found my favorite dish!      I absolutely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I am vegan in Vegas and love me some Mexican food. I am a frequent flyer over at Pancho's Vegan Tacos so when my wife told me about this place in Henderson I was excited to give it a try. I was very pleased! I had enchiladas with rice and beans and a chorizo street taco. I will definitely be back, probably this week!"}
