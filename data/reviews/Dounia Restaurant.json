{"text":"They have great middle eastern food. The price is reasonable, and the location is convenient to get to. The dinning area is small, so I would recommend making your order takeout. The service friendly and quick.  Personally, I've done takeout from them more than five times, I like the way they make their food, you can tell that it has an Armenian twist to it. I even asked the owner if she was Armenian, and she confirmed that she was. The reason why I can tell is that Armenian's tend to make their food even more flavourful, and in this case you can defenatly taste it."}
{"text":"Visited to get some takeout and got the chicken shawarma plate. It was the best shawarma I have had in Toronto. The chicken was perfectly cooked, and made to order.  I have already recommended it to family. A+"}
{"text":"Bland and overpriced. Not sure why the ratings for this place is high, food was terrible."}
