{"text":"Eat all type buffet. Selection is much smaller than in Mandarin but the prices are lower as well."}
{"text":"Got one of those DM coupons - 2 Dinner Buffet for $21.99. To be honest, can't really expect much for a $11 buffet dinner. Food were all dried out, they didn't refill the sushi bar. Luckily, the owner is from Hong Kong, when she noticed I'm from HK too, she told me if me and my husband want anything, she will give me fresh batch from the kitchen.  (I'm gonna give them 1 more star because of that!)

All I had that night was plate after plate of crab legs, I must have inhaled 2 lbs of crab legs all by myself. They have 2 kinds, don't bother to get the warm ones in the steamer, it's all watery; get the chilled ones with the shrimp cocktail, they are firm and awesome!

Anything else are just Blah... The roast beef is dryer than beef jerky....

However, $11 is a good deal!"}
{"text":"I know the restaurant hasn't been open very long, but I don't understand it.  The two times we were in town and went, it was NOT packed as a place of this quality should have been.  I've seen other buffets that are average line them up out the door, but this, so far, is great food, no extensive waiting, clean and well decorated surroundings and a great buffet selection from roasts, soups, sushi, etc... and a good number of rows of service, all of warm and constantly turned over buffet food.  The batter is a light tempura type in most cases for battered food, not that heavy small piece of meat dipped in a ton of bisquick and fried like a lot of the places have come to opt out for.  This so far is a hidden gem worth the money! You can find them at greatmoonbuffet.foodpages.ca but for some reason, it won't take the link in the link area here... perhaps because of the foodpages part?"}
{"text":"The owner and staff are nice, but that is about all that is good about this buffet.  There is not a great deal of variety despite there being 3 hot tables to choose from.  The food is all dried out (it seems to be stirred often to prevent this), crab legs have no taste (maybe waterlogged?) and they are very conscious about their sushi (they were out often and there was a total of 4 families in the restaurant at the time) despite it trading fairly fishy, not fresh. There is also something called a seafood melt there... looks like lasagna with spinach undernearh. It tastes neither like lasagna nor seafood... so if you are up for a good mystery you can try and figure out what it is and why something that is supposed to be seafood is green like spinach.

If I was to give advice to the owner, it would be to freshen up the food... It is very off putting to try and guess how long the food you are about to eat had been sitting there based on its appearance."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. It was fast and good. Way to many onions in my fried rice and they were kind of raw. Plus half of the fortune cookies had no fortunes..."}
{"text":"The quality of food is really good. The delivery is fast and they have great costumer service. I ordered from just eat and everything was correct and hot. I suggest the Cantonese chow mein it is amazing!!"}
