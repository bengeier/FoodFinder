{"text":"This place was delicious!!  Everything we ate was amazing (we tried 3 kinds of meat and 9 different sides). The staff was very friendly. Will definitely be back even if it's a 30 min drive."}
{"text":"Amazing good food. Awesome people. You have to try this. Wish I lived closer. Made us feel right at home as if we were with family from the south."}
{"text":"I began working in Macedonia in May, and while I don't dine out much during the work week there's occasional times where I want to grab a bite. I drive by Sides To Go literally every day, so it was only a matter of time before I gave it a go.

Today was that day, and it did not disappoint.

BBQ ranks in my top 3 favorite cuisines. Not a snob or amateur pit master, just a huge fan of sweet, smoky, fall-of-the-bone tender meat. However, I think where many BBQ joints go wrong is letting the quality/quantity of sides fall by the waist side. A restaurant putting the classic Southern comfort sides at the forefront (and the name) definitely piqued my interest.

Aesthetic: 4 stars
Small dining area with a TV and patio outside. Greeted warmly by the very nice woman behind the counter. You can see all the sides under the counter which is really cool. Took it to go, was in and out within 5 minutes. Extra sauce bottles and plastic ware at your disposal. I imagine the majority of their patrons take orders to go.

Meat: 4 stars
Went with the Meat + 3 sides for $11.99, a fantastic deal for the quality and serving amount. I've heard their pulled pork and ribs are the staples, but I went with the brisket as it's my favorite BBQ preparation. Very thinly sliced cuts, which I haven't ever had before. This didn't detract from the taste but I thought was interesting. I topped it with their Original sauce that had a sweet & tangy flavor that paired really well with the brisket. Very flavorful altogether, not very smoky, and extremely tender. With the thin cuts, I think this would be best served on a bun.

Sides: 5 stars
The sides were the real stars of the show. I decided on two classics - the baked beans and mac 'n' cheese. These were phenomenal. I was a little weary that because they were just sitting behind the counter that they might taste old or lukewarm, but they were steaming hot and very fresh. Such a great taste to both of these. I also went with the hush puppies, which had a savory taste and nice little crunch to them. Bonus side was corn bread that they throw in with every BBQ plate. I'm normally not big on c'bread, but this was decadent and more cake-like than I've usually had. Great way to end the meal.

Overall: 5 stars
I'm definitely coming back here and it's going to be in heavy rotation when I dine out near work."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times now. Our family really enjoyed the food. Only problem is that some times they run out in the middle of the day and you had your mind set on that one thing. Also called on Saturday before Fathers Day for hours and was told they would be open until 7pm. So we wanted our food hot and showed up at 5pm to a sign that stated they closed at 5pm for Father's Day..... My husband was disappointed only food he wanted for today. Sad ending to an otherwise good day."}
{"text":"Definitely an unassuming location, but trust me, stop in!  Had the turkey ribs (yes, turkey ribs) and they were amazing.  Mac and cheese was great along with the okra.  To top it all off the bread pudding was phenomenal.   Funny that there are other bbq places that get the fanfare but this is awesome."}
{"text":"This place has great southern food for real. I first became aware of these guys last summer  via their food truck. I had the red beans and rice which, were very good but not quite as good as mine. Recently I got a carry out order of the crawfish etouffee and greens my husband had the wing's and everything was very tasty,  fresh and well seasoned.  If you like sweet yellow cornbread you cannot beat Sides to Go so good. Great food good people what more could you ask for?  Oh, I know reasonable prices. There you have it."}
{"text":"Stopped by after seeing an ad in the paper. Very friendly staff, helpful in explaining the menu. BBQ is good, and any of the fried items are made to order. Will be returning to try the other sides."}
{"text":"Came here while waiting for my kids to finish dance class last week. Whoa!  Was not expecting the food to be so amazing. Best ribs I've ever had. Meat fell off the bone. I got the spicy sauce. Brisket amazing too. Sides awesome. Today I was at work craving it all day. Most importantly the owners/staff are over the top nice."}
{"text":"Wow,  some of the best BBQ I've ever had.  Side dishes were great too. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Soooo good! I first tried Sides to Go last year when there food truck came to my work. I am happy they have been able to open a store front. The pulled pork and cornbread are so delicious and every employee is so friendly."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and always had positive experiences.  The staff is very friendly and welcoming and the food is top-notch.  I am very impressed with the quality of their takeout BBQ.  I really wasn't expecting much from Sides To Go, but after reading other Yelp reviews, I decided it was worth a try, and was pleasantly surprised.

The pulled pork and cornbread are especially good and there are a good variety of sides to pair with your meat plate.  Check out their sauces to add some extra flavor to your meal.  My only disappointment is that they were out of their vegetarian entr√©e when my wife and I stopped in the last time (she's not a carnivore).  I can't wait for my next visit to Sides To Go."}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite BBQ restaurants in town.  I had the brisket and pulled pork.  Both were very tender and the smoke flavor was excellent. 

Everything is home made and they have lots of side options.   They even have vegetarian options.  

What sets the place apart for me was the staff.  This is a local restaurant and you could tell they wanted to work there.  Great services and lots of laughter.  It's a fun place. 

It is mostly a take out place but there is limited seating available.  It's not a huge place but they make up for it with a lot of heart."}
{"text":"I wasn't feeling very well the other night, so my husband decided to pick dinner up for us at Sides to Go.  Wow, the food was fantastic!  We loved it and can't wait to go back.  It was the best brisket I've ever hard, and I've had a lot.   there are too many sides to count, we tried 3, with the greens being my fav.  Also, he said that the staff was wonderful, very friendly, helpful and nice!"}
{"text":"Such a nice and friendly atmosphere and very clean. The sides were delicious. The fritters were my favorite."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner! Tried this for the first time for dinner tonite. We had 3 meals. 

I ordered 1 meat and 2 sides. Beef brisket, fried green tomatoes, and Jojo's. The sauce was sweet heat. Overall, generous portions and seriously good. 

My companion also got 1 meat and 2 sides. She got pulled pork, potato salad, and mac n cheese. She got the mustard based. BBQ sauce. She loved it. 

My next companion got 2 meats and 2 sides. He got the beef brisket and pulled pork, mac n cheese, and the jojo's. He got the traditional sauce and sweet heat. Traditional is more smiley tasting. 

Oh cornbread was good too. Overall, great experience. People are nice and helpful. Lots to choose from. This will take more than 1 trip to experience all they have. 

Great find. Close to the house so we will make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place and we will be back! We were surprised at how good it was because we don't know of any great BBQ places near us in Macedonia. It's practically down the street from us and we never noticed it because it's located in a small unassuming plaza. The pricing is great and we had so much food where we had leftovers for the next day. I had the beef brisket and that was to die for, and my husband had the fried catfish. I'm not much of a fish person, but I may consider that as my next meal there because it was so good. The mac and cheese was also great and so were the mashed potatoes. The corn bread was yummy without being too sweet and it was all very fresh. There are so many BBQ sauce choices and it took me a while to select."}
{"text":"This is one of the better BBQ places I have been to in Ohio.  Most places around here are afraid to throw smoke on their meat.  These guys soak it in smoke.  I will also add their staff are incredibly nice and really want you to love your food.

I have tried the following:
Pulled Pork - Great smokey flavor
Ribs - Fall off the bone and great smokey flavor
Brisket - not their best meat, not enough smoke for my tastes.  I think this would be better if they threw more smoke on the brisket and maybe did a bark with a rub
Mac'n'cheese - FANTASTIC mac'n'cheese
Kraut - Not bad, just a little too sweet for me
Sweet potato casserole - Great dessert
Beans - BBQ beans are great, one of the best
Cornbread - AMAZING
Fried Green Tomatoes - The tomatoes were a bit too hard for my taste.  I've had better fried green tomatoes

Sauces:
Hot - It's an asian sweet heat sauce that is VERY unique.  I love it
Mustard - It's a great golden carolina sauce
Savory - It's ok, but I'm not a big fan of these anyways
I'd love for them to do a texas-style peppery sauce like Rudy's

Dessert:
Red Velvet Cake - very good

I'd love it if they smoked pastrami (smoked corned beef)"}
{"text":"I love sides and this place does not disappoint. Wish they were in Columbus. I'd be there every day. Sooo good. You'll see me when I'm back in town. Licking my lips. Bring it!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Texas, Tennessee, all over. This place is amazing and the sauces omg. Their JoJo's are to die for. Their ribs are so juicy. You guys have to come here. I even bought more for home and my family to drop off some for them. Yum delicious I say!"}
{"text":"Best pulled chicken BBQ I have ever had!  I loved the crunchy hush puppies & sweet corn bread. Savory southern cuisine has finally arrived in Macedonia!  I can't wait for the outdoor patio to arrive!"}
{"text":"Incredible neighborhood bar-b-q.  I tried the St. Louis ribs with two sides, the ribs were succulent and matched well with the spicier BBQ sauce available. They were really cooked and obviously stored to perfection, sort of surprising giving the warming trays, but whatever the secret is they've got it down. I was even more impressed by the sweet potato casserole and macaroni and cheese. The mac would've made a great meal on its own, and casserole was balanced, buttery, and perfectly sweet. Will absolutely return. My only complaint is that it's closed Monday and Tuesday and I'm always in the neighborhood both of those days! This area lacks so much in food, it's sort of it's own cultural black hole of chain restaurants and old stalwarts of ethnic dining that really aren't great---and a spot like this should not be overlooked, I hope they gain traction and last for years!"}
{"text":"I had the Po Boy, mac and cheese, and baked beans. Real authentic southern style comfort food. Great serving sizes and reasonable prices. Today was my first visit, it will become a regular place for me. By the way, they are now open seven days a week."}
{"text":"The reviews about STG are not wrong! I ordered the 2 meat 2 side meal. I had shredded pork and the St Louis ribs. My daughter asked about the shredded pork and they gave her a sample. Great helpful and friendly service. The pork was seasoned well with a hint of smoke. It melted in your mouth. The ribs were tender, but didn't fall off the bone. The secret though is the three sauces! There is a tomato based Carolina sauce, a mustard based Carolina sauce, and a honey sirachi sauce. They were all good. If you forced me to choose, I would choose the mustard based Carolina sauce. My sides were mac n cheese and sweet corn. I shared the mac n cheese with my daughter. We both thought it was delicious. Also ordered the peach cobbler. At 4.99, it is enough for two or three people. It was sweet, warm, and crispy.  This is one  of those out of the way BBQ establishments that BBQ fans are always in search of. I will be back for more Sides To Go!"}
{"text":"Had someone tell us about this place after seeing him at an expo. This place is so legit! True southern food, and the location unexpectedly adorable inside and the man is so friendly, makes you feel like you're eating at his house! $15 Buffet on Saturdays or we just ordered a meal and ate in! So so worth it, everything was great. Check this place out for sure! :) pulled pork was my favorite! Wish it was open even more!"}
{"text":"Its a pretty small establishment. They serve BBQ Soul Food. I ordered the two meat and two side dinner and my wife ordered the one meat three side dinner. Altogether we got rib tips, turkey ribs, brisket, potato salad, mac and cheese and fried green tomatoes. They put hot sauce in the batter for the fried green tomatoes which my wife loved. 
One of the more amazing things about this place was the number of options available. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. The food is amazing traditional southern BBQ. Service was not the fastest but would come again"}
{"text":"Great brisket, macaroni and cheese, Brunswick stew, mashed potatoes, and sweet potato casserole! The man working a a great guy to talk to and kept a friendly conversation! We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Wonderful and easy takeout. The turkey ribs are amazing. All the sides that I've tried so far have been great. My only complaint is that it isn't closer to my house."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. Staff was professional and friendly. They were very accommodating to the customer.  The food is spectacular. The restaurant is very nice and clean.  I will definitely be back and recommend SidesTo Go."}
{"text":"Food was not good greens are out of a can serving portion are small food was cold will not be going back at all meat was over powered by smoking"}
{"text":"Yummy food good prices clean space and great ownership.  The foundation of a great start to a great place. Everytime I go I try something new but the rib tips are out of sight good. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Great Food!
I saw them featured on tv and immediately knew it was a winner. They make bbq like bbq is supposed to taste! Friendly staff too!!
Tho you can dine in, its set up for to go orders. I suggest you take it to go and use your sales tax savings to get another side. Veterans park is just 2 blocks away. I got the ribs with 3 sides: mashed potato, turnip greens, and red beans and rice. Comes with cornbread. All were fantastic!
I managed to get sauce on my clothes, but who cares!"}
{"text":"Finally a southern style BBQ joint with a huge selection of sides. I haven't had authentic southern food like this since I moved from Texas. Their bourbon Siracha sauce was sweet and spicy. Do yourself a favor and get the fried okra and the hush puppies.
To add to the great food, the staff was so nice and friendly. They have won some new customers."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful place. I've told anyone I can about it. The staff is incredible, and the food is top notch. 

Reasonable prices, you owe it to yourself to visit here."}
{"text":"On edit:  Went again last night for the fourth time.  I had the Jo Jo's again and they were similar as the last time.  They aren't bad by any means.  I just expect a little more spice.  Took care of that myself by dusting them with my own cajun dry rub.

I still have to change my rating to five stars because everything else is so awesome!  The service is top notch.  One can tell they care tremendously about their customers.  I need to get her name, but she is a perfect front person.  Great attention to customers and the compliments to my son and a friend about how proud she was they both had gpas above 3.5.  No knew else would do something like that.  And the food...well...you really can't get better BBQ around here.  

I hope they succeed for a long time!"}
{"text":"Went in here with my friend thinking I wouldn't be able to get anything since I'm vegan. I was surprised to see they had vegan pulled pork! It tasted great and their baked beans were amazing  Staff were really nice too, I definitely felt welcomed"}
{"text":"At first, we thought that Sides To Go was a carryout only spot. I had left the family in the car to go get our dinner and realized that we could eat in. We were so pleased with the customer service, right off the bat. The employees are so friendly and welcoming. The food was delicious. Literally, everything we ordered was so good. We were in the mood for barbecue and this hit the spot. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, we especially loved the hush puppies. The meats were really delicious, too, with a variety of sauces to choose from. We're originally from Columbus, with an array of barbecue choices; we are so happy to have finally found such a good place so close to home."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! We ordered here tonight and I'm so glad we did. I called ahead to be sure they were open because recently we couldn't get ahold of them: My husband left and went to order to go. The food was amazing! I really love the sauce it's kinda tangy and awesome. My husband said the guy working was super friendly so we will be back."}
{"text":"What a total 5-star find. High five to my Yelp app for leading me here when my family wanted barbeque. First off, the obvious: there's a severe lack of bbq in the burbs. Secondly: the name of this place doesn't do it justice. Yes, they have a million sides, but this is truly some delicious meat.

The restaurant itself is fast-casual (you order the way you would at Chipotle) and you can eat-in or take your food to-go. You can also order pickup through the Yelp app (HALLELUJAH). When we visited, we ordered a slab of ribs and several large sides to go. One large side is $3.99, so there's really no excuse to not try several things. Favorite sides: sweet potatoes, fried green tomatoes (a bit spicy!), mac and cheese and the Brunswick stew. The ribs are d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s...perfectly cooked and available with multiple sauces. The prices are super reasonable, and it makes me ridiculous for all the times I've paid $$$ for sub-par bbq in the city.

All of the sides (and most of the meats) are right behind the counter, so don't be shy to tell them if it's your first visit! Ronnie (I believe that was her name) was so helpful. She let us try tons of samples and recommended her favorite meats. Once we were home with our food, everything was spot-on. We were full after just a few bites and it made the best leftovers. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"So happy that I finally stopped at Sides To Go BBQ. Got the 1 meat - 3 sides meal. Sliced brisket was tender and delicious and got a mixture of the Carolina Red and the Carolina Gold sauces - quite possibly the best BBQ sauce I have ever tasted! Sides were collard greens, mashed potatoes and mac 'n' cheese - all were excellent, especially the mashed potatoes. Speaking of best things I have ever tasted, the included cornbread was definitely the best I've ever had. Not as dense as most cornbreads, almost a \"fluffy\" texture to it. Can't wait to go back and try more of their many offerings."}
{"text":"Sides To Go is located inside of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport (CLE) - post security on Concourse C. It's right next to the Potbelly on Concourse C. It just opened!

NOTE: I correctly entered the address of this location of Sides To Go as being inside Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. Afterward, someone at Yelp has incorrectly changed the address to a non-Airport location. I have reported this to Yelp and requested they correct the address and location back to how I submitted it. So far, they have ignored my request.

Until Yelp corrects this - the correct address for this physical location is:

Sides To Go
Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, Concourse C
5300 Riverside Drive
Cleveland, OH 44136

They do a variety of Cajun and Barbecue dishes. I ordered the Duck and Sausage Gumbo - with no rice - and no sides (apparently it comes with cornbread and a drink) - but I already had plenty of water and am watching the carbs - hence no rice and cornbread.

The Gumbo had a nice spice level to it - very tasty! My only complaint is I'd like a larger serving of it!

#SidesToGo"}
{"text":"Good BBQ, great people.

My wife and I came here for lunch the other day, we've been wanting to try it for a while.

She got the ribs and I got the brisket.  Both were very good - extremely tender, nice flavor, not a real heavy smoke.  I tried both the mustard and the milder BBQ sauces and both were very good.  

The sides were pretty good.  I liked the okra and tomatoes the best - reminded me of the stewed tomatoes I had when I was a kid, though my wife wasn't a fan.  The green beans and the black eyed peas were OK - the beans particularly were kind of overcooked for my taste.

The corn bread was yummy - it was more like cake than bread.  Even my wife liked it and she's not a corn bread fan.

The best were the people working there - very friendly, loved talking with you and even gave us a couple of freebie smoked chicken wings to try (very good, very smoky).  

OK, maybe not the best BBQ i ever had, but one of the better ones around here, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"These people make amazing food. I stopped by on my way home to get something for dinner. They have delicious beef brisket and a lot of sides, hence the name.  I chose creamed corn, green beans and corn bread. Everything was so good! I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time here. Was greeted by a great staff, told us what they have and gave us some samples. The food was very good, large portions. I would recommend and will be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here once and loved it.  We were greeted with great hospitality and delicious food.  The pulled pork was some of the best I have ever had. The selection of side dishes was outstanding too. 
Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Very good food with a large selection of sides.  Very friendly staff.  It was very busy.  I placed our order on line.  When I arrived it wasn't even pulled.  She apologized multiple times and offered a free beverage while I waited.  I felt as if they cooked FOR the people, not simply worked in a restaurant serving food.  She asked everyone there if they enjoy their meal.  I enjoyed my drink while looking over all the sides they offered.  I had the Carolina pulled pork sandwich and greens.  Smoky but not too over powering.  Greens were tender and tasty.  Would certainly eat there again."}
{"text":"I was very surprised by this meal! I got the fried catfish, red beans and rice, collard greens and cornbread. It was DELICIOUS and my fish was piping hot! I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Awesome service, Awesome Food.. just plain Awesome! I haven't had BBQ that good in a lonnnnnnggg time."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place - always a supporter of new and local businesses.  The food was cold (we did take it home, but it was not hot when it was boxed up).  Honestly, the ribs  tasted more like \"leftovers\" than freshly cooked BBQ.  Maybe will try it again because I really want to love it!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious. Real southern comfort food! And the staff is always really friendly and willing to give samples and suggestions. This place is new, but it's doing everything right. The owner has a catering business and he catered the RNC. His food is that good!"}
{"text":"very impressed with this local business opened 6 months ago.   the Corn bread is to die for  nice a thick.  let's talk about the creamy Mac n cheese..  so many side choices and meat choices. The owner is one of 6 local vendors to be selected to serve at the 2016 RNC held in Cleveland. quite impressive!  the sides are their main business and wow are there many.  you can also taste test if you want. love the hospitality."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to stop in Sides to go for quite a while since I drive by every so often and wonder about it. I was always a bit hesitant though because it looks a bit dodgy from the outside. I also wasn't sure if this was more of a catering establishment than a takeout restaurant. Turns out, it's a bit of both and although it's quite small inside, it's very clean and easy to navigate the lunch menu. I came in at noon on a weekday and the place wasn't at all busy, but I was greeted immediately by the woman working there. As I contemplated the menu, other folks started to trickle in and I could see this place getting a decent lunch crowd. Their menu is pretty similar to many other barbecue restaurants I've been to where you can mix and match meats and sides as per your preferences. It was also interesting to see that they had some Cajun/Creole dishes such as etouffee and gumbo. Since the restaurant was fast casual, customers can see most of the hot sides that are being dished up, and I will say some of them looked like they had been sitting out for a while, but I think this is dependent on your overall feelings about food served in buffet trays. I will also say that the sides I tried tasted fresh. I chose the two meats and two sides platter, which is priced similarly to other barbecue restaurants at $14.99. I didn't get to try a whole lot on my first visit, but here's what I did try:
- St. Louis Ribs: not the best ribs I've ever tried, I found them a bit on the dry side, but my platter included about 5 ribs so I felt this was a generous portion. 
- Brisket: again, this was really quite dry and not at all comparable to other brisket I've had at this kind of barbecue restaurant. I honestly wouldn't order this again
- Mac and Cheese: knocked my SOCKS off. I have been consistently trying mac n cheese at other comfort food restaurants and a lot of Northern restaurants just can't seem to get it right. This was creamy, cheesy and not at all gritty like a lot of pre-prepared mac and cheese dishes are. I would definitely recommend others to get this and might come back exclusively for this. 
- Fried Green Tomatoes: I love all forms of fried food, so I thought this one would be a gimme, but to be honest I found the breading to be a bit weird. It was almost a breadcrumb dressing, but not the homemade kind. It didn't have a satisfying crunch even though it was fried to order. It wasn't terrible, but I definitely wouldn't order this again
- Cornbread: this was a solid cornbread. It was slightly sweet and perfectly crumbly without being dry. I am happy to report that this came included with my meal, but even if it hadn't, I would order it again. 
- Bourbon Sriracha BBQ sauce: this sauce was the bomb. It was delightfully sweet, smoky, spicy and tangy. Definitely a must-try for spicy bbq lovers. 
- Honey mustard BBQ: I really liked this bbq as well. It wasn't quite as tangy as other mustard based bbqs I've tried and I thought it paired really well with the smoky brisket. 

Overall, I wasn't overly impressed with Sides to Go, but I was really glad I finally tried it. I am interested to try more sides and would probably return if I was in the area and craving barbecue. Also, I would say if you're a mac and cheese lover you won't be disappointed with the version here! I also want to mention that the service was top notch and although there was only one woman working there when I came in, she was really friendly and managed the flow of business well."}
