{"text":"Great sushi at an even greater price. Was a lil skeptical about not being able to see them prepare the rolls, and it being a take out only joint... but when I say it was really fresh & delicious. I mean it!!  Will definitely be a stop the next (and everytime) I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Decent sushi at an extremely good price. It's a very small shop so we took the rolls to go. For ~$38 we were able to get 5 rolls and 2 udons for dinner. The service was kind of slow at the time but I went with 5 other people who had separate orders. It probably isn't the best sushi in town but you can definitely satisfy a sushi craving given the low price and large rolls. We plan on going again."}
{"text":"I feel like this place must be a secret or something, super quick, delicious sushi at a great price. I like this sushi better and felt it tasted fresher that some decently nice sit down sushi restaurants I find myself at from to time. Keep it up! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy salmon maki lunch special and a mini side salad with ginger dressing for lunch. The sushi had a good amount of fish in it, but it was very small portion. The lunch portion was suppose to be one and a half roll and figured that would be perfect. The roll was not spicy at all, but was able to smother in wasabi. The salad was fresh but I was a bit grossed out by the pickles on it and the dressing was inedible. I would like to fixer his place another chance."}
{"text":"K.O. offers some pretty standard sushi items. They have a modest yet good selection of sushi and soups. They have a couple good vegetarian options like the V3 roll and the vegetable undo soup.

The place is a small take out with no seating directly outside. However, right up the street is Romare Bearden Park! Weather permitting, it is great to sit at the park and eat lunch.

Compared to other sushi joint in center city K.O. is dramatically more affordable. You can easily get full on sushi for under ten bucks. All and all a great place to grab some lunch on the go."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.

Location-wise there really is no place to sit. A couple of bar stools. It's a take-out place.

The food is amazing. The seaweed salad was particularly delicious, which surprised me a lot, considering that it's seaweed. I was also please by the vegan options on the menu. Add to all that the fact that it's super-duper (cheaper than supermarkets) cheap and does delivery--and you know I'm coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place!! After moving to Charlotte, KO quickly became my favorite delivery place. It is so convenient and fast! The sushi is always fresh (lovee the Rainbow Roll) and they even have specials! Their rolls are pretty big and you can customize them if you want (like adding toppings on a pizza). The best part is that you can order online and by the time you get home from a hard day's work, they are already at your door. I would recommend this place to anyone who isn't a sushi foodie, but just enjoys some simple rolls after a long day of work or a lazy weekend."}
{"text":"I consider myself a connoisseur of take-out sushi,  everyone needs to know a lot about something right?

K.O is solid sushi with reliable delivery, good value and unlike most sushi spots...is very easy to order from. My wife and I  have ordered from here three times since we moved to Charlotte six weeks ago and we have been really happy with it.  It is about 40 bucks including delivery for the two of us.

Highly recommend the Hiro, Crunchy and Tiger Rolls."}
{"text":"What a gem! I was in town for business and asked the hotel's front desk clerk for a sushi recommendation.  Totally skeptical when he mentioned a \"good take-out place\" and followed up with \"My favorite is the California roll!\"  Pressed for time, I lowered my expectations and gave it a go.

K.O. is smaller than small, and I almost walked right past it.  Glad I didn't however, because like they say - good things come in small packages. The counter staff was informative and enthusiastic, the menu is overwhelmingly diverse, and the sushi turned out to be some of the best I've had!  Don't pass up the Volcano roll for a different take on a spicy standard, or any roll which comes with their very unique and tasty Angel sauce."}
{"text":"So today after a short shift at work I decided I wanted some sushi. I work at Packard place which is right next door to K.O Sushi so I said hey why not. I got the spicy tuna box and it came up to $7.90. There was a pretty large amount of lives in the box. I enjoyed the sushi! And the cashier was present."}
{"text":"Tilapia is NOT Snapper. Cashier made a mistake while reading my sashimi selection back to me ... said \"tilapia\" instead of \"snapper\", which is what I ordered. Tilapia is absolutely nowhere on the menu, but, for some reason, she said \"tilapia\". Why would she say that? When I asked her to repeat it again, she said \"snapper\" the second time.

I'm very familiar with both types of fish and both, in sashimi form, look almost identical. The flavor was extremely close to tilapia and upon further investigation and discussion with my wife, we're 99% certain we were given tilapia. Look up images of snapper and tilapia sashimi and see what you think.

I wouldn't have a problem with getting tilapia instead of snapper if they told me that I was getting a sub and adjusted the price for the cheaper grade of fish. There is a very, very slight chance that I really did get snapper, but the fact that she said \"tilapia\" leads me to believe that I didn't and that they use tilapia as a sub for snapper and customers aren't made aware of that.

Anyway, the rolls that I've tried along with most of the sashimi are good. For fast food sushi, it's not too bad.

I just have a problem with restaurants who assume diners won't know the subtle differences in specific ingredients. Another reviewer mentioned getting a cheaper ingredient subbed for a premium one in his soup. Therefore, it seems like this is a common practice at this spot."}
{"text":"I think this place is very underrated. They make great sushi! Everything always tastes fresh and delicious, and the service is quick. Online ordering makes things super fast and convenient. Prices are much more reasonable than other places in uptown, and the rolls are substantial, not skimpy like at some other places. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Just the other day I was wishing there was a quick take-out sushi place downtown. I saw this place on Yelp and went down to check it out. 

It's a small place with only two stools for seating, so you'll definitely want to get it to go or have it delivered. The selection of rolls is pretty standard, but varied enough for my tastes. The maki rolls are about 4 bucks, and their \"special\" rolls are about twice that. Maki rolls are pretty much the size you would expect. We picked up a few of those, along with a special roll -Rainbow- that was nice and plump.

The quality was pretty good. The fish tasted fresh and the sauces were tasty. I thought the rice was very slightly undercooked because it was a little looser than expected, but that's really a very minor issue that will probably vary from day to day. 

Overall, I'm pretty happy with it. It's great to have a take-out sushi place downtown. I'm sure I will be going back there many times."}
{"text":"The sushi is great, but I am not a sushi fan.

I ordered their Chicken Teriyaki bowl. Not good at all. Bleh."}
{"text":"This is a very satisfying meal everytime! And I order sushi for take out at least once a week from these guys. Spicy Tuna roll is bomb, also the crab volcano is a must! Honestly try it out its good and its not too pricy. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim while walking along Tryon and definitely am so glad I stopped by. Such a little place tucked around the around next to Jimmy John's. I got the Firework roll ($10) and spicy salmon roll ($4.50); this even came with a free drink. Such a great price and quality is on point. Rolls are 8-10 pieces each, and the amount of actual fish/content (aside from rice) is generous!

If I worked/lived around the area, this would be my go to for quick sushi no question! It was quick and the lady at the front was so patient with all my simple questions."}
{"text":"You should know that the hours posted on their door aren't their actual hours. We showed up hoping to grab some sushi for a late lunch around 2pm. The hours on their door said they were open from 9am to something like 7pm that day. But they were closed. Confusion? I called them through the afternoon, and when I finally got someone, he said their hours were 4:30pm to something like 9pm. I don't even know. So confusing.

There is only street-parking, and no place to sit inside, as well as no bathroom. Patrons get around this by sitting on the floor as they wait for their sushi. The sushi itself is fairly decent quality.

It's a good place to walk to if you're downtown for a quick a tasty bite, just be sure to call ahead and make sure they're actually there before you go out of your way."}
{"text":"I love my sushi however I would not recommend this place unless you are low on time. They are very fast but the quality is not up to par. I would consider this place below average sushi"}
{"text":"It's tough to give sushi in this town above 3 stars. I'm spoiled, I'm from the New York where sushi is incredible and we don't shove cream cheese or mayo into everything and call it a day. 

However, this place is quick, easy, and filling. Makes for a good lunch spot, in a town that needs more variety for lunch."}
{"text":"Super fast takeout place! Don't expect to dine in though. It's a little hole in the wall with cheap and fast service. I got the chicken udon, took it to Amelie's French bakery around the block and was a happy camper by the end of it."}
{"text":"If you're strapped for time but want some very decent, inexpensive sushi, this is definitely the place. Pick a sushi, any sushi. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My husband just told me I need to update my review for KO as I, literally, go to KO once a week for lunch!! I have also Postmates ordered it for dinner here and there. 

I nicknamed KO, Knockout sushi, because it is exactly what I want from a to go sushi place (no tables inside). Quick. Cheap. Simple. Friendly. 

I have gone through rounds of my go to roll. First it was the Hiro Roll. Then Perfect Match was my roll of choice. Next, it was Dragon. Currently, my roll of choice is spicy tuna. The chef mixes some sauce in so it's a bit different than the typical tuna roll with spicy mayo on top. Usually I get a small edamame with it or a mini salad with ginger. I have also tried the salmon and tuna shashimi and it always tastes so fresh. 

Service is what puts KO over the top. The same lady is always behind the counter. Despite there being 15 people in the small restaurant waiting on orders and the phone ringing, she always remembers that I don't like cucumber and I don't need soy sauce. That's service. 

KO, I'll be back....in a few days! 

Pro Tip- Any order over $7 gets a free drink
Pro Pro tip- For the Mon-Fri Uptown worker crowd, go at 11 am or 2 pm or plan on waiting 20-30 minutes....or call ahead!"}
{"text":"I was visiting in Charlotte and needed something to eat. I saw that this place had pickup so I decided to order and boy am I glad that I did. The website is convenient and easy, if used on a laptop or desktop I would not recommend on a phone. And also the sushi is incredibly cheap! My cucumber roll was 3.50 so I was very worried it was gonna be like 2 pieces but no it was MORE than what I usually get from most sushi places. It took a bit for the food to be ready but that is how it is with almost all sushi places. And the taste was just as good. One of the best sushi I've ever eaten in fact. If you are ever in Charlotte looking for something to eat, this is the perfect place."}
{"text":"Meh is a good word (or sound?) to describe this joint.

It's a great place for a quick lunch during the weekdays but I would never come here with a sushi craving.  I got take-out one night for dinner (was pretty desperate for food and hungry).  The sushi here is mediocre.  The quality of the fish isn't anything you're going to be impressed with (can't expect it, with the low prices).

This is a good bring-back-to-your-desk lunch for the workaholics out there.

I will agree with the other Yelp reviewers that it's a great place for the money though."}
{"text":"the spicy tuna roll is really good and the fish seemed fresh. i also ordered the teriyaki chicken and rice dish and that was super good too. the portions are great (8 pieces for the roll) and a mildly hearty rice dish. the prices are great as well and i cant argue with that yo."}
{"text":"My sister came to visit from Houston so after we visited the Bechtler Museum of Modern Art, we walked down to K.O. Sushi for some take out dinner. It's small b/c it's mostly for take out orders but there are two small sections for seating at the windows. I had a Philly roll and sushi rice that was ready in about 15 minutes. There's a flat screen HD TV you can watch while waiting but I chose to catch up on some Creative Loafing reading. I could tell we had just beat the after work crowd b/c as we were leaving patrons started pouring in. 

All in all, a great place for some take home sushi :-)"}
{"text":"I work in Uptown and go here for lunch at least twice a week.  I love the veggie udon soup.  The service is fast and the food tastes fresh.  My pick for \"to go\" sushi in Uptown.  It is not a sit down place so there are no tables but I usually take it back to my office anyway."}
{"text":"Take-out. Their physical location is just a kitchen, phone, and cash register - don't think you'll be eating here.

They are close enough to most of the uptown apartment buildings that you can order online (http://www.kosushi2go.com) and walk down to pick it up 10 minutes later. Ditto for the uptown lunch crowd. The sushi is quick, cheap, and easy. I have no experience with the delivery, but allegedly it's pretty solid too.

You aren't going to get world class sushi at $4 a roll, but it's good value and they make it as convenient as possible. Think sushi meets fast-food."}
{"text":"Live in Uptown or surrounding neighborhoods? Love sushi? Appreciate delivery? KO Sushi needs to be your next phone call. Delivery guys/gals are always pleasant and arrive on their mopeds rain or shine or snow. Sushi is really good for delivery. It's cheap and they even have combo platters for a discount. I usually go with the #11, which comes with 2 basic maki rolls for $7. Spicy tuna and spicy veggie call are the choices. I then order the shrimp tempura and godzilla roll. Make sure to specify how many sets of chopsticks you need as well as your soy choice...fully leaded or low sodium. Order usually arrives in under 45 minutes. Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I was once told that food could be fast, cheap or good, but not all three simultaneously. KO Sushi has proven that person who told me that thing that one time wrong. I eat their Stormy roll with an order of edamame about once a week. My boyfriend gets the Spicy Yellowtail. Not only are we both incredibly happy with our respective rolls, but the cashier remembers our regular order in a nice and not at all creepy way. 

Make a single good decision for once in your pathetic life and go to KO. Tell them that weird couple who come in every week sent you. I don't think you'll get a discount or anything, but it will be funny when they know EXACTLY who you're talking about."}
{"text":"This is not anywhere near the best sushi you will find Uptown, but I'm giving K.O. 4 stars for other reasons.  It's cheap as hell and really quick.  I can grab my tuna/avocado roll for $5 plus tax.  That's an absolute steal.  I should caveat the service by saying I usually grab lunch outside the typical 12 o'clock hour for obvious reasons, but I know you can call ahead to avoid waiting altogether.  I'd rather just order at the counter, get it rolled fresh, then walk over to Romare Bearden park and chow down!"}
{"text":"This sushi spot is average at best. The rolls have too much rice and hardly any fish. I would rather pay extra and get more substance than just eat a bunch of rice. I wish they had some sort of seating. I go here when I need to grab a quick work day lunch. It's on par with grocery store grade pre made sushi"}
{"text":"Stop the rice madness! Too much rice on these rolls. Looks like you guys are now rotating 3 pieces of the lunchbox so that all pieces can fit because the rolls are too big."}
{"text":"This place is great if you want something fast and easy for lunch. Do not expect some fancy sushi here. They only do takeout orders so you can call in and pick it up. The food wasn't bad for the amount of sushi that you get and you really can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"The price is right and the food is dynamite.  The fact that Charlotte has a good sushi place downtown was exciting for me.  They have lots of fresh fish and they even deliver.  If you like sushi, definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Terrible! I threw the majority of my order away. The soup was inedible. The sushi turned my stomach. I'm still hoping I'm not going to get sick from this experience. 
The service was fast, though."}
{"text":"Great sushi at a great price and walking distance from most of Uptown. Particularly if you work for Wells Fargo. Order online, especially during lunch as it gets really busy! Lunch box or any order over, I think $7?, and you get a free soda. Always fresh and always tastes great! I am hooked."}
{"text":"This is really good sushi for a takeout place! The sushi tastes just as good if not better than fancy sit-down restaurants. I usually just walk in the store and order, and it usually takes around 10 minutes to prepare it, similar to other takeout joints. 

I am a huge fan of their special Fireworks rolls. It's got so many fresh, good ingredients, such as tempura shrimp, cucumber, other fish (I can't remember), and thick, grilled tuna wrapped around the sushi rice, topped off with their sweet soy sauce! It's very rich and full of unique flavors.  

Also, try their octopus salad. It's a good compliment with your sushi. 
I would also recommend their Charlotte or K.O. combo which includes nigiri. 

For the quality and price, it is a great value

I have not tried their \"hot\" food yet, such as udon or hasaki plates, but I will keep you all posted."}
{"text":"Finally a reasonable place for Sushi in Charlotte that is actually good. If this place were in San Francisco, I would likely only give it three stars but compared to what I have had in Charlotte this place rocks. It is take out only but they do a good job at it. One nice touch is a little soy sauce tray they give you. Fish is fresh though Tuna is lower grade.

Overall, a good experience

Best Miso Soup in Uptown Charlotte"}
{"text":"Excellent place for lunch in uptown!  The customer service is great, and although there is usually a wait due to the long line, it is totally worth it!!  Love the sushi too!  :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time on Wednesday and it did not disappoint.  The rolls were fresh and delish and you can't beat the price.  

My favorite rolls (that I will be ordering again) are the Perfect Match Roll, Anything Roll, and Tiger Roll.  

This place might have the best sushi in town."}
{"text":"Great rolls. My favorite is the Tiger roll. Good seaweed salad. Most of the girls I worked with frequented this place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Fresh delicious made when you order sushi!  Very reasonably priced.  I hit this spot each time I'm in Uptown and have time for a meal.  Great clean small sushi place - a real gem!"}
{"text":"Five star sushi. This place is a to go place with no sit down tables. Where else can you get high quality sushi for such an affordable price? We got four rolls for $20. You can't beat it."}
{"text":"KO Sushi is one of my favorite places ever.  Doug who works days is super !  I used to work across the street and now I plan my week to make at least one trip into Uptown to get KO Sushi.  I love their Spicy Tuna - and good miso soup too!"}
{"text":"New in Charlotte and my son loves his Sushi and this place is fantastic and knows his order when he comes in. You know a place is fantastic when they can remember a kids favorite order and get it done reasonably soon for a hungry growing boy."}
{"text":"I hesitated at first giving a five-star rating to a carry-out place, but this place is 5-star. The sushi was fresh and the portions were generously cut. We ordered a selection of nigiri and rolls to go. Prices were excellent, particularly when considering the value. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Been ordering here for years and I think their food is good, their delivery guy is awesome.  The service in store is so so. Not really customer friendly.  Along with other bumbled orders , the other day my pregnant wife was denied to use the BR as I placed an order.  Will move on ."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's so convenient especially if you work uptown. It's a take out sushi spot that's fast, efficient and pretty tasty. 

Today I got the spicy tuna roll and the philly roll, both were pretty good. The spicy tuna has a special chef sauce which makes it so much different than other places. I will definitely be back, too bad they aren't open late..."}
{"text":"Update: Last week I was on my way to Jimmy John's to grab a quick sammie and ran into a friend who was downing some veggie udon noodles here.  On his recommendation, I changed my plans and ordered the noodles, too.  They were quite delicious and great for a winter day.  He also said the sushi rolls (the ones I didn't get the first time around) were quite good, too, so maybe I will try sushi at the place again in the future.  But, I will definitely come back here for the noodles. 

It's nice to be able to unban this place from my work lunch spots now."}
{"text":"K.O. Sushi is my go to for sushi in Uptown Charlotte. I have gone there almost every week since my first visit. Why? ... Because it's delicious and fresh, the menu has lots of options, has easy online ordering and all at a great cost. It's a take out spot meaning there's no room for fancy decor or chairs even. So you shouldn't take your date here. But the small square footage affords them low overhead which in turn allows them to price their product accordingly. At least that's my hypothesis. The lines are out the door during the work week lunch rush so order well ahead of time and still be ready for a wait. Any other time, order online and 20 minutes later you'll be stuffing your face with delicious fish wrapped in rice goodness. 4 rolls will cost your around $25-30 and will feed 2 people or 1 really greedy person who wants left overs."}
{"text":"How anyone thinks this is good sushi is beyond me. I take it as what it is: Fast food Sushi on the go.

- Fish are like canned food, but the good kind.
- Service is real quick, to a point it's scary.
- Very simple and easy to use website, easy to get what you want.
- Doesn't taste too good, but doesn't taste terrible.

If you are craving something quick and want some decent but not good sushi, this isn't a bad option. Don't expect too much as it's not that good, and if you think it's good then it's time for you to go to an actual sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi on the run. The portions are pretty good as most of their rolls are 12 pieces, but don't expect anything too fancy. Expect your basic rolls like spicy tune, California and shrimp tempura. The sushi rolls are pre-made so come early to beat the weekday lunch rush. For extra fresh sushi, you can call ahead for pick up."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Even better prices! This is one of our \"go to\" restaurants for sushi, and is definitely the one we order from the most. It's not an option if you're looking to dine in, but is great for ordering to pick up or for delivery."}
{"text":"This is a no frills sushi place.  They are primarily a take-out or delivery sushi place.  There are two small stools near a counter window if you're really needing to stay.

The menu is pretty limited to the mainstays of the American sushi scene.  Don't expect anything fancy on it.

Their seaweed salad was priced cheaper than I expected but somehow it had a salty taste, just slightly, it threw me off as odd.  The calamari salad was also cheap and tasted very good.

I tried some of the salmon and yellowtail rolls as well as ordered a sushi of salmon and yellowtail.  At first I thought the price of the sushi was kinda high for a single piece;  $2.50  But when I saw the sushi, the fish was a big piece, so I was much happier with the price.  Both the sushi pieces tasted better than the rolls to me.  Next time I'm just going to order straight up sushi and not the rolls.

I will say the maki rolls were decent sized in diameter, certainly not your smaller variety.

Quality was OK to good.  I think their fish is reasonably fresh.  They do focus on the mainstays, so they try not to have much to carryover.  In fact, I think I noticed they have a 50% discount after a certain time...was it 3 pm? of any fish left in the cooler, so that they do get a good turnaround.

Overall, I'd say good in a pinch.  I'd put it on par as freshly made grocery store sushi.  Which is definitely a step above grocery store sushi as sushi that sits in the cooler for a while is yucky as the rice hardens.  And the price is reasonable, though I wouldn't go as far to say cheap, but then...do you really want to try cheap sushi?"}
{"text":"It is truly a love/hate relationship with this place. Love the food but not the service. I order shrimp Udon and when I got it, it did not have one piece of shrimp in my \"Shrimp Udon\" but imitation crab. Not cool!!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Charlotte from San Diego, and have been looking for a decently priced sushi with good quality. K.O. is moderately price and the sushi is fresh. I like the fact that it is a take-out place. We had the Dragon and Eel roll as well as the seaweed salad. Everything was great and I will defiantly go back soon."}
{"text":"Still love this place for sushi delivery, however, on a whim, I decided to order the chicken terryaki since there is a $15 minimum delivery and it was terrible :(  There is a ginger infusion to it, but it tasted very odd.  It was only $6.95 but I could only have a few bites and then I tossed it.  Again, sushi is great.  I just wouldn't recommend straying from their main forte!"}
{"text":"The sushi is really good for the price they offer. I had the philly roll, spicy tuna roll, and the spicy yellowtail. All three rolls, while not the best, exceeded my expectations. Both the yellowtail and the tuna were perfectly spicy, ideal in every sense. The philly roll was among the best that I've had. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Fantastic and fresh. Good variety and fast! The \"party pack\" is a great sampler. Veg and non fish options available. Parking for take out is a bit sticky but, worth the walk if you can. Online ordering is complete and effective."}
{"text":"this is EXACTLY what I would want in a delivery sushi place... 

I ordered sushi online at 7:30 tonight. On there website every item had descriptions so I knew what I was getting myself into and I didn't have to encounter any miscommunication issues which typically arise when ordering over the phone. 

the delivery guy appeared 30 minutes after I placed my order. They have a delivery minimum of $15 and they charge a $1 delivery fee. I deducted one star because I think they can either charge the minimum or the delivery fee, but it's really like .5 star because its not a bad minimum or a bad fee. So cheers to them. 

I ordered yellow tail sashimi, the hurricane roll, and the KO roll. My favorite was the yellow tail sashimi; it was fresh and I will definitely order more next time. It was only one piece which sucks but it was a large cut. And it was served on a bed of thinly sliced cucumber which was not only nice presentation but a good little snack. 

They give you nice chopsticks (they seemed nicer then the normal ones) and a little soy sauce dish (wrapped in the napkin). 

I will be ordering from this place MANY more times in the future and if they keep up their level of service and quality I see a 5 star update in their future :)"}
{"text":"Alright sushi. At least they have a few good roles for $5 ish. Good and quick for a pick-up lunch during the work week.

No seating. Takeout/Pick up only."}
{"text":"Went today. Service was fast & the food was great. I got two good sized rolls for $11."}
{"text":"1st time customer: I did an online order for delivery, but I didn't get my food until almost 2 hours later. I did however get half off! Other than that issue, the sushi was great! I will order it again, hopefully without a delivery problem."}
{"text":"quick and very friendly staff.  This is a good value for lunch sushi in uptown."}
{"text":"The portion of chicken plate is too little! Crunchy roll is of reasonable size. It is a clean take out place. I probably will try again."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi we've had, and at an amazing price! We got 2 specialty and 2 regular roles for $25. I would definitely recommend this for a good lunch or takeout dinner spot. We went to the restaurant to order and it was ready in under 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I was walking around downtown Charlotte, craving sushi, and stumbled across this place. I was travelling for business, and alone, and not much in the mood to sit down at a full service restaurant.

I loved the Friday special, 20% off the special rolls, so I got the Hurricane roll and some edamame. The edamame was a tiny bit overcooked, but still delicious. The sushi was fresh and tasty. Quality takeout sushi at a reasonable price. They definitely satisfied my sushi craving."}
{"text":"This has continued to be a solid go-to lunch spot for sushi. Not going to sugar coat this one and say I have tried the whole menu or branches out to any of their exotic rolls but what I have done is ordered the same two or three rolls (Cali, spicy tuna, philly) on a regular basis and each time know exactly what I'm getting and haven't had a bad experience, can respect the consistency here!

2¢- if you are trying to pick up during noon hour plan accordingly to wait or call ahead"}
{"text":"I travel to charlotte for work on a regular basis (will be moving soon) and I've been on a mission to find great sushi in this city. I've been to Niko, which does have a great environment and good sushi, but it didn't blow me away.  Also, sometimes I'm just not up for all that after a long day, which is why I tried KO. 

Now my rating is partially based in food and on convenience because there is no eating in here. As for the food, I would say 3.5 stars, as I didn't like the spicy tuna, but the salmon and yellowtail were great-very fresh tasting! Also the seaweed salad was good but had a little too much dressing on it for my taste, it should be a cleaner taste in my opinion but all in all a good takeout/delivery option at the end of the day. 

What got this place to 4 stars for me was the online ordering. I absolutely hate calling anywhere and placing an order over the phone and I'm glad to see that sushi has followed pizza by participating in online ordering. It's not that the people aren't nice or pleasant (the staff was actually quite pleasant during my pick up) but I just don't like calling, so this place makes me very happy and I will definitely be ordering sushi online again from KO."}
{"text":"This sushi is okay at best.  There are way better options in the area, but the price is right for maki rolls and they have a combo special.  One thing I do like for working in the uptown area is that they do online ordering.  I've never had to wait for my food, I just order online and pick it up.  The service is friendly, but with sushi I'm super picky and this place is good if you want a cheap fix."}
{"text":"yummy food for cheap quick delivery only paid $22 dollars wow that great.  I order a few things the seedweed salad was really good."}
{"text":"Spicy crab lunch box was delicious! I will be making this a regular lunch stop. What was even better is 20% discount when raining! WoW!! $5.60 for a 16oz bottle soda & 12 pieces of sushi. LOVING IT!!"}
{"text":"So I had to try the u-do noodles folks reviewed about here...

Fast...fairly priced....and a funky discount based on weather makes this"}
{"text":"This is a very small takeout place! I was so shocked with the low prices and great quality! Ordered spicy tuna spicy yellowtail and a rainbow roll! The yellowtail had absolutely no filler. It was big chunks of yellowtail. I'm in Charlotte for the next three week. I'll deathly be there at least once a week"}
{"text":"gosh, Charlotte must have low standards in sushi. This place was fairly terrible. Threw away 80% of my order. Salmon should have a taste and rice should be white, not 50 shades of gray."}
{"text":"A To-Go sushi place with incredibly reasonable prices, free delivery (for order $15 or higher), and a sanitation rating of 99.0? Yes please.

I had an avocado roll and a cucumber roll. $2.50 (or $3?) a roll. Can't beat that. The only complaint I can think of is no Inari (tofu skins)! 

When I'm feeling lazy and not in the mood to cook again, I'm totally going here."}
{"text":"I wish they had more roll options but what they do have tastes good, comes at a very reasonable price and is close to the office.

Unfortunately though, the other day they gave me a salmon cream cheese roll instead of a salmon cucumber roll.  That was highly disappointing and annoying since i had to waste time stripping half the cream cheese out of each piece in order to enjoy them."}
{"text":"Probably one of the only decent quality seafood for an affordable price in Charlotte. The lunch maki combo is only $6.50 and included two maki rolls and a drink since after tax you're over the $7 limit. I've had specialty rolls there which are generally pretty good. The seaweed salad is also good but make sure you have floss with you. Tip: after 2 or 3pm all pre-rolled sushi in the fridge is 1/2 off."}
{"text":"Walked by and had a late lunch- pleasantly surprised - for a take-out sushi place the rolls were delicious-fresh and good sized- we had 5 different rolls all were delicious and very fresh- I'm a stickler for fresh :) the salmon, yellow tail, were excellent .... Happy tummy- we crammed into a corner - so the only negative isn't really their fault - they are a take-out and delivery place - not a sit down restaurant - but the quality of the food is that of a sit-down/more expensive restaurant. A plus - my 9yo and 6yo loved their rolls and the udon."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw there was a sushi place in the same building as my apartment! Even more excited when I read all the good reviews and this one will certainly be no less. The quantity and quality of the food is definitely worth the price! It is much cheaper and much better than other places I have experienced lately. Just note that this is a take out place only. There are no tables or anything to even sit on while you wait for your order. I tried calling and ordering online but had trouble so ended up just coming down to order and figured if it took a while I'd just come back but it was ready in minutes. Will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. a small take away place but loved the food.. got crispy and Hiro roll and both were good."}
{"text":"A fantastic place to get take-out sushi! The quality is solid. All products used are good. Generous portions of avocado and ginger. Also, I believe there is a discount off their menu on Saturdays. I hope one day they expand to have seating... it is so good."}
{"text":"Damn. This place is ridiculous: fresh huge rolls, ridiculously inexpensive, and fast. Yes, this a takeaway place. They are probably at max capacity but it is so worth it. This place is a MACHINE."}
{"text":"Great little take out place. Price vs quality, can't get any better. Go for the udon!"}
{"text":"It is hard to believe there was ever I time where I hated sushi because lately it seems I have been on a sushi eating binge. Went to K.O with a friend tonight- we ordered 4 rolls to split between the two of us spicy tuna, firework, Hiro, and Dragon. My total with a coke zero and 15% student discount (grad school is good for something : ) ) came to $14. The amount of food was crazy, we really should have stuck to three. 

The eat-in area is basically two stools and a counter- it was extremely uncomfortable. What made things worse is that we had to wait 40 minutes for our food! We had to check in a couple times and were more than a little miffed that it took that long and that we weren't pre-warned. 

Once our food came out the mood lightened up because we were in cheap sushi heaven! I was extremely impressed with the quality and freshness -you simply cannot beat the price! We barely finished our rolls but we did manage to stuff the last one down...again 3 rolls would have absolutely sufficed as I am in a food coma currently. 

Both of us enjoyed the Hiro roll the best - but all four tasted great.

I will be back...for take out only."}
{"text":"Hubs and I stumbled onto this little gem very soon after we moved to Charlotte a few years ago. Since we lived in the Fourth Ward at the time, we were thrilled to try sushi delivery just a few streets down. 

We've since ordered KO (delivered to our house - just a mile south of Uptown in South End) and every time we get it, the sushi is basic, but fresh and delish! The delivery guy is always nice and he definitely works hard in the rain on his moped to ensure that we get our food in an adequate amount of time. I don't think we've ever waited more than 45 minutes for our food and the one time it was sub-par (wrong items and jumbled from the ride over), they very kindly comped our next order. 

I would recommend the shrimp tempura roll, spicy tuna roll, spicy veggie roll and the Godzilla roll (my personal fave). Per some other reviews, definitely pay attention to the specials - they make this little spot even more affordable than it already is! Just make sure you hit the minimums required for lunch or dinner orders...we never have that problem as we typically eat our weight in sushi. 

Yay for KO."}
{"text":"I waited too long to try this for lunch. Walked up from work and ordered and had my food in about 5 minutes. Got the lunch combo which was one order of sushi and a drink. I got the spicy tuna and it was 12 slices, perfect amount for lunch. I could have used or asked for extra wasabi as it barely spread to all of the rolls. But loved the flavor and the speed. They deliver too."}
{"text":"I order delivery from here every week. It is really good! Especially those special rolls."}
{"text":"Recently opened sushi take-out/delivery place offers freshly made sushi at a good price.  It has all the common sushi selection and the service is fast.  I called in my order and it was ready in 5 minutes.  I had the combo #6 for $10 (8 pieces of sushi of your choice).  I had Salmon, Yellow Tail, White Tuna and Spicy Tuna.  Slices were generous and the fishes were fresh.   It's such a great bargain.  I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The other night during the torrential downpours we were craving sushi. And all of you sushi lovers know how that goes, you could not think about sushi for weeks, but the minute it pops into your head you MUST have it. So we decided to try KO. Like morons, we decided we'd walk over and get it. 20 minutes and one broken umbrella later, soaking wet, we made it back and dug in. We were very impressed!

First and most importantly, the fish and all of the other items inside the rolls were very fresh. We ordered 4 of the special rolls and loved them all, especially the volcano roll - so tasty! Be aware, though - some of these rolls are HUGE! Took a few tries to fit it all in my mouth! 

The miso soup was, well, miso soup (can't really go wrong here, let's face it we are eating seaweed and tofu). The Crunchy Roll was also delicious, as well as the Panthers Roll. The sauces that were put on them made the roll, gave it a little kick. Prices were what you would expect - anywhere from $5 to $9 for the specialty rolls and $4 maki rolls. My only suggestion would be for them to offer more speical rolls to choose from!"}
{"text":"A great sushi spot! This place is a  hidden gem. Sushi made fresh. A large menu and variety to choose from. The best part is they are reasonable. It is a take out spot  so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Finding parking here can be a bit of a challenge, but worth it. The food was fresh and reasonable in price, and the service prompt. There is no dining area, so they only do carryout. Perhaps they also do delivery? Best part about the joint other than the food is that you can order online!

{"text":"GR! yelp address was wrong, this place is ACTUALLY on 3rd street and Tryon (more on 3rd street).

They have some secret February specials that I wish I knew before!
Monday: 10% off special rolls
Tuesday: Free drink with your order of $10 or more
Wednesday: Free drink with your order of $10 or more (delivery not included)
Thursday: 20% off all nigiri and sashimi
Friday: 20% off special rolls (5pm-9:30pm)
Saturday: 20% off all orders
Sunday: 20% off with valid student id
**All specials exclude combo and fax orders.

I thought it would be a nice little walk to KO, but the area is pretty ghetto and deserted at night. I got asked for spare change EEK! I would recommend just getting take out, besides they don't have indoor seating anyway and delivery is just $1.

Love how generous they are with the seaweed salad. Wish the sashimi was a little cheaper, but still a good dinner option. For some reason I can't get my order under $20 ever. It's still a solid and affordable sushi option."}
{"text":"This is a small take out spot so I did not expect much.  Found it very fresh for a good price.  I only order at night. They always make my rolls fresh to order.  They did have a display case it looks like they may fill up to accommodate the lunch rushes so I can't comment on their pre-made rolls.  I am a very satisfied regular customer."}
{"text":"Hello Friends

I've come here many times. Guess I forgot to write a review!!

Welp, again Grumbles and I ventured out on this Wet/Sunny/Rainy day in search of wonderfull BIG LUNCH. 

The 2nd of my BIG LUNCH stop (1st being Jersey Mikes #9). I walked into K.O. today about 11:15ish. Much to my delight, I was the only patron inside. Great, I beat the lunch crowd. 

I ordred the Rainbow Roll - 7.99 = California Roll with 5 kinds of fish (see pix)

It was pretty good. I'll try it again

ONLY thing I DON'T like about this place is the fact they they go behind a secret exit to make your roll. Like, What are you guys doing back there. I would like to see someone making my food. Not just taking my order and vanishing into the back somewhere."}
{"text":"I don't know why, but I love this place. Parking sucks, but if you can get there, it's worth it. Cheap and good. I get the KO Deluxe. It's a lot of sushi for $11. Add the spicy mayo, please. I go in, place the order, they make it, and its to me in 5 minutes. It's a no thrill place. Carryout only. And they don't prepare in front of you. The place is small, and they had to make room the best they could. I saw a few comments about that. If there is an event, good luck parking close. And construction is making it hard. I've risked illegally parking before and been lucky. But I have also skipped the place cuz I couldn't find parking close."}
{"text":"KO has my favorite sushi in Charlotte. It's quick and easy, but they don't sacrifice freshness or flavor.

KO is a go to lunch place for my coworkers and me in uptown. It's take out only, but it's enjoyable to head over to Wells Fargo and eat or easy to bring back to the office. I love their lunch specials: free soda with purchase over $7, 50% off a $20 purchase on your birthday, and the lunch box combo, which gives you more pieces than a regular roll, but not as much as two rolls, which is just the right amount. And it's about $7 to $8, which is super affordable.

My new favorite thing is to call them before I leave the office, and then swing by to pick up dinner on my way home.

Don't be fooled because it's just a take out sushi place. So far, it's the best sushi I've have in Charlotte.

(the only downside is for delivery, you need to order $30 or more)."}
{"text":"Definitely don't get the philly roll. Straight up fishy as hell. I mean, I get there's salmon in the roll but it just tastes like I opened my mouth while swimming at the beach."}
{"text":"This place is good, but not great. It tastes a bit like grocery store sushi. Not bad, just know what you're getting into when you get fast food sushi. Delivery required $20 minimum, but was speedy and easy. I got the Tiger Roll, Dynamite roll, and an eel roll. I was hungry, so ate them all!! My favorite was the Tiger roll. It was a fancier, tasty roll, but nothing to write home about. The dynamite roll was a bit sweet for my liking, but it was still good. The eel roll was blah - very mediocre.  I enjoyed the convenience of delivery, but this is no fine dining and this is no \"great sushi\" if you're a foody. It's just like picking up sushi from Kroger or Publix, or maybe slightly worse.  Not sure why so many great reviews, since it's so mediocre."}
{"text":"I order delivery from here all of the time! Grade A quality fish! The rolls are absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"It's a fast food sushi place with surprisingly fresh food.  

Service is great actually... the dude up front who takes your order and is the general \"face\" of the organization is super attentive, very nice and a little uhmm... what's the politically correct term.... uhh... well if you spoke with or met the guy you'd know what I was talking about - he's really nice!

There's only a high top bar area in a crowded space, so don't plan on sitting and eating here, the entire place is organized to be take out only.  Also - good luck navigating their website, that thing could use some help - it took me 10 minutes to find their phone number!

Tips:  They've got a promotion now where if you buy $8 worth of sushi they'll give you a free can of soda.  They also have a frequent flyer card where you can get a discount if you repeat visit so often."}
{"text":"Love the spicy yellow tail, and my girlfriend loves whatever complicated roll she gets."}
{"text":"Yeeeah I love this place. Cheap, quick and fast like a takeout urban sprawled sushi joint should be. Tuna rolls are around 6 bucks and quite tasty. Although the menu is quite slim, they do offer the necessities. 

Seating is limited to about 4 benches so be prepared to take it to go. Being it's a take out joint, in true fashion they deliver. Mega points there for one of the few delivery restaurants in the area. Not to mention sushi!"}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised with this place that I had never even heard of a week ago. A friend told me about it, so I decided to give it a try despite the modest Yelp rating.

The ordering process was extremely convenient. It was very simple to order online, and you're even given the option of customizing your roll by adding extra ingredients. I didn't take advantage of customizing this time, but I'm sure I will in the future.

I'm always drawn to the specialty rolls, and the first thing I noticed here were the very affordable prices...there were a few specialty rolls for as little as $5.25 and many more for $6.50 or less. I decided to get one relatively expensive roll and one cheaper roll.

My more expensive roll was the Magma Roll for $8.50. It had two pieces of shrimp tempura and crab with baked spicy crab salad on top. This roll was amazing! It came with 8 pieces, and with all the crab salad on top, looked quite formidable. To be honest, I probably could have called it quits after just this roll, but alas, I'm a glutton for sushi.

The cheaper roll I ordered was the Hiro Roll for $6.50. This one had shrimp tempura, masago, spicy mayo, avocado, crab, and cream cheese. Though not quite as good as the Magma Roll, it was still very delicious, and for $2 less was probably better value. It came with only 6 pieces, but the pieces were huge. My girlfriend called out my faux pas of not eating each piece in one bite.

I will definitely be back to check out some of the other specialty rolls (and get crazy with adding new ingredients).

UPDATE: Enjoyed K.O. so much last time, it took me less than a week to return. This time I ordered the Bagel Roll for $8.50. It came with 9 big pieces and had crab, cream cheese, and avocado with salmon and more avocado on top.

Loved this roll just as much as the Magma and Hiro. The pieces of salmon were extremely generous...I can't believe how much fish you get for such a low price!

UPDATE: Tried a new roll today. This time I ordered the Hung Roll with baked salmon, avocado, cream cheese, and jalapeño. There were 10 pieces for an incredibly inexpensive $5.25. It was probably my least favorite of the four rolls, but it was still quite good.

UPDATE: Tried two new rolls today. The first was the Fireworks Roll. It had two pieces of shrimp tempura, crab, cucumber, tobiko, and torched spicy tuna on top with special sauce. It was really good...I loved how crunchy it was. However, at almost $10, it's the most expensive roll on the menu, and to be honest, I think there's better value with the cheaper rolls.

The second roll I ordered was the Stormy Roll. It had crab, shrimp, avocado and a choice of cream cheese or cucumber. It was cheap at only $5.25, but it was the most boring roll I've had from K.O....I don't think I would get it again.

UPDATE: Tried the Tempura Roll today. Nothing really to write home about, but very good value for the low price of $5.50. It came with 8 ample pieces, and the spicy mayo had just the right amount of kick.

UPDATE: Tried the Crunchy Roll and the Shrimp Shumai. The shumai was decent, but I think I'll stick to sushi from now on. The crunchy roll was similar quality to what I've had at Harris Teeter, but for less than half the price. 10 pieces for $5.50 is truly an incredible deal.

UPDATE: Ordered two basic rolls today: Tekka (Tuna) and Salmon. There was a very generous amount of fish in each roll, but it wasn't the freshest tasting fish I've had. The salmon roll was slightly better."}
