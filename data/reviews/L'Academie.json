{"text":"Expérience vraiment désagréable... Me sentir ainsi HUMILIER par un gérant de restaurant c'est vraiment innacceptable. 

 Dimanche matin on s'est présenté au resto mon conjoint et moi avec une promo acheté chez GoYub qui nous donne droit à 40$ de bouffe. Je vérifie toujours très bien les restrictions à l'achat de ces promos et c'est ce que j'ai fait lorsque je me suis procuré celui-ci: IL N'Y AVAIT AUCUNE RESTRICTION sauf St-Valentin et Ferié. On n'était donc au resto avec notre promo hier matin en vue d'essayer le brunch. On nous dit que le rabais n'est pas applicable. Demande de voir le gérant qui arrive avec son air frustré, ne nous laisse pas placer un seul mot et nous fait lever de table afin de nous obstiner que le bon n'est pas valide.... Il devient très arrogant même si nous nous sommes SUPER CALME ET POLIS. Il nous traite comme DE LA VRAI MERDE.... Nous regarde de haut avec son air condescendant et nous pointe la sortie. 

Vraiment incroyable de se faire traiter ainsi dans un restaurant. D'abord, cette promo DEVAIT ÊTRE RESPECTÉ puisqu'une mentionne ne restreint son utilisation au brunc. ET deuxièmement POURQUOI ÊTRE AUSSI AMÈRE et CONDSCENDANT..."}
{"text":"We had a great evening at this location.  The food was REALLY superb.  I had the smoked salmon as an appetizer and my boyfriend  had the coquilles st-jacques.  Both were a really nice size and tasty.  We then had the yellow fin tuna with pepper which was cooked to perfection and the little sauce that came with it really was a perfect match.  The veggies were also al dente.  My bf had the veal San Daniel and it was really REALLY  GOOD.  The sauce was rich and well seasoned and the portion was perfect.  We finished our meal with 2 decadent HUGE desserts : the mille-feuilles and the chocolate mousse.  Service provided by Manon and the restaurant  manager was both warm and efficient. It was really appreciated  especially  since the restaurant  was packed and we did not feel rushed nor forgotten.  Great place!  Will go back!"}
{"text":"I've been several times to this location. The service has always been pleasant.  The mussels as usual were really good. This time we ordered l'italien, delicious (don't breath on anyone after- loaded with garlic!).... instead of my usual roquefort - which are really good. The fries were A-1 as apposed to my last visit when the fries arrived cold. 
- It was only my second time having the pasta. I decided to have the fettucini with smoked salmon.  Sooooo salty, and I traditionally like salt,  and very little cream sauce.  Too bad since the pasta was cooked perfectly but really, forget ordering this. -My previous visit when I ordered the pasta it was also a little short on the sauce, although my friend who ordered the spagetti boulognese said it was really good and it appeared that the sauce was plentiful.  We ended our meal sharing a tiramisu that was amazing.  
-Of course, bringing your own wine is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"Casual eatery of the Scottsdale Culinary Institute in main shopping district of Scottsdale. 

Everything on the menu is prepared by the students. Very reasonable prices with everything priced $12 and under. I had the chicken panini with fresh waffle potato chips and my mom had the burger with a jicama salad. The servers are also students and ours was a bit clumsy, but sincere. Both entrees were delicious, although found my sandwich a bit dry. I think a creamier aioli would have done the trick. 

A photo shoot began at the table next to us towards the end of the meal, so the chef comped us two desserts for the inconvenience. I had the flourless chocolate tort (how could you go wrong with this) and my mom had the strawberries and cream with homemade shortbread. 

I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to eat here, but if I was in the area this a definite bargain lunch place for the quality of food. 
Oh, and they do have a wine list priced around $25-40 per bottle--also very reasonable."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is quite stunning.  High ceilings, modern decor, and the lighting have the place looking as if it's ready to turn into a high-end nightclub at the end of service.  It's surprising that such a beautiful restaurant is attached to the local mall.

While the restaurant is admittedly beautiful, and while the prices are very affordable (and it's BYOW), the quality of the food is consistently sub-par.  I've been to this restaurant 4 times now (lured by the ambiance and prices), and I've been disappointed every time. 

On my first visit, the steak was chewy and the side vegetables were sparse and over-done (soft).  On my second visit, the pasta was just average.  On my third, the appetizers were just passable.  Finally, on my last visit during a dinner service, the veal was over-cooked and the sauce was simply horrendous.  The sauce was a gelatinous yellow mess that looked the opposite of appetizing.  I left more than half my plate full, perhaps for the first time in my life.  If it wasn't for the bread rolls, I would have still been hungry and I would have been a very cranky date, indeed!

In short, if you're a student on a budget and would like to take someone out on a date (who IS NOT a picky eater), and you're in the area, I guess this is an okay place to be. Otherwise, if you're looking for a romantic and tasty night out, I recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I ordered the mussels and they were good. Others in my group opted for veal and pasta. They thought it was very mediocre. The ambience was quite loud."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The food was cold, we have to send 2 dishes back to the kitchen. The taste was very so so."}
{"text":"Wow so disappointing , wanted a bit more upscale but got old cheese that was very stale... Fish was cooked terribly ...cat food manacotti and apparently we were being loud ( there was no one else there) so the waiter gavee the stink eyes....nice 
All in all they can cook an ok steak but that's about it .... Get it together guys"}
{"text":"Really unimpressed.  The restaurant has been going steadily downhill for the past few years. Ordered the mussels and have not had worse before. Tasteless sauce, broken shells throughout so i thought it best not to touch them after a few bites. Waiter never came by to ask how the food was. When the waiter finally came by at the end of the meal I explained how poor the food was he said he would speak with the manager. When he returned he did not even apologize for the food and simply presented the bill. As this was not my first poor experience there, upon exiting I spoke to Frederic, the manager(?) Who said I can come see him next time and he'll do something for me. Needless to say, there will NOT be a next time."}
{"text":"Nous avions une réservation pour 12 personnes pour 20h30 et avions demander d'être à côté des toilettes (pour raison médicales). Lorsque nous sommes arrivés nous nous sommes fait dire que la table n'était pas prête et que de toutes façons les tables ne sont pas garanties..... Alors que nous avions appelé 2 fois pour vérifier et que par 2 reprises nous avions été assurés de la table. Le gérant est un jeune très condescendant  envers les clients, il n'avait vraiment pas une belle attitude et n'acceptait pas de se faire prendre en défaut.  Nous avons attendu plus de 20 minutes debout pour nous faire donner 2 tables au lieu d'une. Wow un partie d'anniversaire où tout le monde n'est pas assis ensemble c'est vraiment pas cool! Donc après 20 minutes nous avons eu 2 tables....et avons attendu plus de 20 minutes pour avoir les menu...et personne ne nous a demandé ce que nous voulions pour boire. Lorsque nous avons commandé il manquait beaucoup de chose sur le menu, là non plus aucune excuse ne nous a été fait à part qu'il était tard. Après avoir commandé nous avons attendu plus de 30 minutes pour avoir nos plats et une serveuse pas plus gentille que le gérant qui au lieu de s'excuser de l'attente mais \" s' estinait \" avec nous que cela ne faisait pas 30 mais que 20 minutes que nous attendions et qu'elle pouvait pas faire des miracles qu'elle avait d'autres clients et qu'un des chefs n'était pas rentré la nourriture était correcte mais sans plus, pour ma part des moules ne se servent pas trop cuites ni sèches...mais bon les autres plats était convenables.  En résumé nous avons été reçus comme des chiens dans un jeu de quilles, avons eu un service pourri et à moitié mais la facture elle était salée pour la qualité de ce que nous avons reçu. !!"}
{"text":"Recently had lunch here. Service was top notch, the food was disappointing and not fresh. My chicken salad had spoiled (rotted ends)  lettuce greens and a spoiled cherry tomatoes. I discovered these items half way thro my very large salad , nonetheless it dampened my appetite and I did not trust the rest of the plate . It was pointed out to the waiter who removed the plate from the table but not from my bill . Coffe was good."}
{"text":"We had gone to L'Academie on Boul. St Jean a few years ago and had found the food to be extremely underwhelming. 
Jump ahead a few years: My sister's surprise party was held there on June 2nd. The food was outstanding, and the service was great. 
Paul was really looking forward to going back. 
We returned tonight on one of our rare dates. 

The food was exactly as bad as our first meal there. My veal didn't taste fresh, the side vegetables were doused in some salty spices and the pasta was DRY. Seriously. It was supposed to be pasta aglio e olio, except they were just dry lol. Someone forgot something. 
My husband ordered the same dish he had ordered last week: veal tortellini with rosé sauce, but it didn't taste the same at all. It tasted like frozen noodles...

Let's be honest. I can understand the food being a miss. No big deal I suppose. It happens. However how it's dealt with makes all the difference in the world. 
I told the waiter the quality wasn't even close to what it had been for my sister's party and that it was unfortunate, especially after it had been so great last week!  He replied that he'd speak to the manager. 

The waiter came back a while later and said, \"I spoke to the manager. There's not much we can do. I guess we'll keep an eye on it. But that's about it\". 
I just said, \"ok\". But what I was really thinking was, \" seriously?!\". 

I'm FLOORED. I will never go back, and I will always let people know about this experience.

{"text":"Over-packed, disorganized and pretty mediocre food. Better to spend a few extra dollars by going downtown to eat.

We were greeted by the downstairs hostess who told us to go upstairs and radioed ahead. Upstairs host had no idea why we came upstairs. Had to look at a paper printout to validate our reservation. Table was not set when we arrived. 

Bread and water was delivered right away, but no waiter showed up for over 20 minutes, even after asking the host to send one. 

Food was very average. Over-salted, and otherwise bland. 

If you enjoy ordinary,  pedestrian food, and lots of waiting for it, L'Academie is your place. 

Treat yourself and go literally anywhere else than this restaurant-in-a-mall."}
{"text":"We came on a rainy Sunday evening when it was not very busy.  Good thing.  I would hate to see how long it would take to get seated and our meals if they were actually busy.  Nonetheless and overall good evening with some highs in the food department and when we finally got our server, things went well.  
Note: Make sure to buy your wine before you get there and bring it in!
We shared some apps, the fried calamari, and it was a little chewy.
For the mains we had a huge portion of mussels Provençal.  The mussels themselves were nice and tender however the sauce was a bit thin.
The meat on the osso bucco was to die for.  Soooo tender and yummy and lots of it.  The pasta was cooked al dente but once again, the sauce was a little thin.
So some great highs that would have merited a resounding 5 stars but for the sauces being a little thin.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"A group of 16 went to dinner on news Years to celebrate a birthday. (The reservation was booked weeks in advance)  Adults and teens. It took 1 hr 30 mins for service and meals came 20-45 minutes later. 4 meals were wrong. 2 were gravely wrong as the recipients were given food to which they are allergic. We expressed our dissatisfaction numerous times. We understand busy but there is a limit to patience. The manager offered an apology and free desert. We noted that we would prefer a dscount on the bill and she began to explain how the service was not their fault and the kitchen made a mistake and we should have asked a waiter and not waited for them to come to us. She also offered a giftcard for a future visit although with 16 of us at the table I don't know who would have used the gift card, perhaps we could have shared it 16 ways??? We asked them to apply the credit to our bills and she said she could not, and continued to explain why this was not really their fault. That's when we really got upset since blaming us for their mistakes is nonsensical . Anyhow, They ended up comping a few meals but the ordeal took over 3 hrs and we spent most of the time waiting for any type of service or even regret or remorse for the lack thereof. We didn't have desert and didnt get a gc. In the end,  the birthday was memorable although for the wrong reasons. The manager,  although likely trying to do well was not equipped to deal with the situation, taking it personally. We are typically not a tough group but this was insane. We won't be  back."}
{"text":"Much better than the flagship location on St-Denis. The mussels were larger and fresher but the fries could have been more brown. My friend was very happy with her pasta primavera. Their regular coffee isn't good. Next time I will try the penne rosee and I hope I'm not disappointed! Conveniently located off the T-Can in the strip mall on St-Jean across from Fairview."}
{"text":"Update:
Brought my review from 4 stars to 2 stars. The last 2 time I went there I had the worse service people. Waitress pointing the finger to ask people for their order, being rude. And last time I was talking with my mother and she went with the water pitcher right in front of my mother's face almost hitting her.

Initial review:
Good food and good service not much more to ask for.
We made an online reservation and it was a breeze.
Only thing I was a bit disappointed is that it's a byob, which I did not know and it was not clear on their site.

Only downside and it's not the restaurants fault was some if the people at one of the other table were really loud. To the point of being annoying."}
{"text":"NAME: L'academie

RECOMMENDED FOOD: Corn and Crab Chowder
RECOMMENDED PEOPLE: None yet
ONE LINER: A culinary student run restaurant up the escalators by saddle ranch in oldtown.

Overall: 3 star
Food: 3 star
Service: 4 star
Atmosphere: 4 star (if you like academic energy)

HIGHLIGHTS:
L'academie is a culinary student run restaurant.  They have one chef and one floor manager that are teachers and one teaching assistant for the chef.  Everyone else is a student.  There were nine people behind in the kitchen, only one of whom was female I noticed.

I love academia, and of course food, so it was fun for me.  I took detailed notes and submitted them at the end of my meal.

They are only open tue - fri, 11:30a - 1p for lunch and 6 - 7:30p for dinner.  They do not close at 7:30p, they simply stop seating people after that, but are happy to seat you right up until that time.

FOOD:
They present the desserts and drinks on a table on your walk to your seat.  They had mojitos as their drink special for the evening so I had a few of those.  The student bartender/server didn't blink an eye when I ordered it strained.  It was perfect for me, not too sweet.

I ordered the barbecued shrimp served with a chickpea, avocado, tomato salsa.  The shrimp was well cooked and the avocado was delicious.  They served me a complimentary taste of the roasted corn and crab chowder.  Spicy and delicious!  Real slivers of crab meat that still tasted sweet despite being in a chowder.  I'd say that is the must try item here so far.

The bread was served with three butters, regular, sun dried tomato and dill.  The dill butter tasted very strongly of dill (though the second pat the bartender gave me just to compare it to was much more mild).  All very nice.

For dinner I had a NY Strip.  This was at best average.  I ate it, I was happy, the red wine shallot marmalade was good as was the cabernet demi, but it didn't sing.

I will be heading back to L'academie again as I just liked how eager the students seemed to be.

SERVICE:
Charisma: my bartender/server was very pleasant, nice and conscientious.
Helpfulness: he went out of his way at all times, above and beyond normal.
Menu Knowledge: he was stumped of a few things like you get when taking a test.  But he was eager to run and find out what he didn't know.

Star Explanation:
5 star: one of my arizona favorites!
4 star: great eats, recommended.
3 star: good eats
2 star: avoid unless with good company
1 star: avoid despite company"}
{"text":"Eating at a cooking school was a novel experience for me, and one I'm glad I did. We did have a really hard time finding the place, since the building number was obscured by a tree. We found it by walking searching and that was when I saw the number nicely tucked away and obscured in the corner. From the moment we walked in though, everyone was very friendly. 

Later I realized I would have preferred to sit  at the counter so I could watch the preparation. But I digress. We were brought bread right away, 2 types - baguette and one with apricots. That with the 3 butters (reg, honey and jalapeno) was awesome. We were brought a second round without even having to ask. So by the time the (very good) crab cake appetizer came we were already stuffed. Nonetheless we continued on the meal like brave little soldiers ... brave little soldiers should be so lucky ... before I get any notes, this is a joke, people ... and actually they were - top chef. last Wed.

I wanted to order a sandwich but was told they only had sourdough bread. That was a bit disappointing - I wish there was more than one kind. However, the pizza I had ordered made up for it. Very nice in what I think of the real Italian style. Thin, grilled crust, light on the cheese and heavy on the flavor. MH had a burger - very good meat, similar to that we had at Joe's. We both ate half and got boxes for the rest.

I really wanted dessert but had no room. I mentioned this and wanting to take it home to the server but she didn't offer the option so I didn't push. I figured it was a sign that the universe was not in favor of this.

The serving staff was awesome - very nice and attentive. In fact I got my water glass refilled more times than I can count - I just kept drinking automatically because of it. Kind of like a robot but it was very sweet. I liked the decor - creative but at the same time not fussy or overdone. I did kind of wish the menu was a little larger - not much, I know they're limited, but just a bit. 

Next time I may come alone to indulge myself at will - no one to see all my little plates! And I'll sit at the counter."}
{"text":"Guess I should have read the bad reviews before going. Best thing is is that it is a bring your own wine. We ordered the mussels and they seemed to day old mussels which were completely dried out. When I told our waitress she just smiled and walked away. I told her again and she said you are supposed to dip it in the sauce (which was salted water) to rehydrate them... Seriously? Needless to say it was horrible."}
{"text":"Malheureusement pas grand chose de positif à dire sur notre expérience à L'académie... Je vais toutefois m'efforcer d'être constructive. Je suggère de diminuer la quantité de vinaigrette sur la salade en entrée. J'ai commandé le poisson du jour (espadon)... les portions pourraient être plus petites et les  accompagnements plus raffinés. Mon époux à commander des pâtes qui auraient pu être moins cuites."}
{"text":"the hours change every so often, so check ahead, but this place is better than most \"professional\" places. they had an unanounced function once during lunch and the hostess told us to come back and she'd hook us up with a free appetizer. so we went back the next day, and not only did she remember us, but she comp's us one entree and the app. plus, the students did a fine job seating, cooking, and serving for us. great prices, regardless of the freebies"}
{"text":"First, I think it's important to remember what L'Academie is: this is Scottsdale Culinary Institute's casual, bistro-style restaurant. As such, every encounter with staff is an encounter with a student, from the host stand to the table service to the kitchen. 

Last night, we spotted the fruit and cheese plate on the dessert table upon our entrance. You see, while the menu is seasonal (maybe to coincide with semesters?), the desserts are changed out more frequently to allow for creativity of the student chefs. The offerings are displayed along with some featured beverages which you are forced to pass as you enter the dining room... a great way to remind you to save room (wink, wink). I guess you could say we had dessert first!

Our \"starter\" featured slices of Manchego, and wedges of blue cheese and a smokey brie bordered by walnuts, pistachios, dried figs, apricots and cranberries and halved red and green grapes. Only real complaint: there were too few pieces of crostini (although we were graciously brought more upon request) and some of the green grapes had browned. Overall, it was a nice way to start the meal.

I had the five onion soup. A velvety potage, the soup's aroma was slightly better than its flavor. A bit heavy on the pancetta and worcestershire for my taste.

The presentation of the crab cakes  was lovely. Three timbales of crab and peppers surrounded a small bunch of fresh greens bound by a tomato slice. The vinaigrette on the greens was a highlight.

L'Academie has a notable wine selection. I was delighted to find Molly Dooker's 2007 The Maitre D Cabernet Sauvignon on the list! Deliciously oaked goodness!

Truth be told, it feels like a cross between a classroom and an average American bistro. But, you know what? That's what it is... and, what better way to support young people who love food as much as we do and want to spend their career bringing it to us?!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Brunch places and this is the first that announces it at one price and bills you another.  When we mentioned it waitress was aware of the problem claiming it was impossible to correct.  Wow!  They should hire someone that changes the misleading advertisement on the net.  
Apart from billing food was OK, Service  was good."}
{"text":"I love the downtown and st-denis branch, never had complaints before but this particular location really lacks in customer service. Things were forgotten. Server wasn't friendly. Restaurant was dead and we still didn't get any attention. PS don't waste your money on the pasta bolognese or the Caesar salad!!!"}
{"text":"My list of positive points on this restaurant...
1. its a bring your own wine 
2. ...... (crickets).....(more crickets..) 
List of positive is complete...but the review is not. 

We went in a group of about 12 people for a birthday dinner, the service staff was first of all unprofessional, not friendly ... when I got there I waited about 20-30 minutes for someone to come open my bottle of wine.. so if you would like to enjoy this feature and the only positive experience of this place..bring your own opener, you will personally send me a thank you letter if you do this.  I asked the server or busboy who brought water if he can open it, he said the waiter had to do it, which he was no where to be found. When he finally came to the table it was to take the order, he refused to open the bottle till the orders were taken, so I refused to give my order till the bottle was open.. I won that game. 

To start I ordered a caesar salad, the portion was way too big for an entree, they should lower the price and portion size on this by half. My main course i ordered tortellini rose , which as you can see in my pictures had a nice surprise of linguini pieces. My favourite part of this service, my mother who was sitting in front of me ordered the chicken plate, she was brought a plate with \"meat\" covered in a sauce with fettucini on the side, when she took a bite she said \"oh i don't think this is chicken\" so she took another bite to be sure ,right after this the waiter came and said to her that he brought the wrong plate , that the plate she had was veal. Now i know were all thinking whats the big deal just bring it back to the kitchen and replace it, especially given that she told him she had taken a bite - but instead I watched the waiter bring this plate , and serve it to the person it belonged to.. enough said. 

In general the food was eatable, given that it might have been someones left overs. 
i tried the brownie cheese cake for desert to satisfy my sweet tooth, it was ok. 

I hate giving bad reviews because I genuinely have a passion for amazing , flavourful food, but this was 100% not that."}
{"text":"Ambience of a cafeteria. Service meh, I realize we were a large group but when a server comes over with a tray of coffee and says \"who wants one\" - well no. I had tuna ($29)  asked for it rare got it medium well - food was very salty. The calamari were ok. The ginormous kids portions are a joke as were the regular pasta portions - seriously how much food do you throw away at the end of the night? The Cesar salad wilted and not good, the pasta Romanoff was gloopy and very peppery according to the person who ordered it. The mussels looked good. Not good value for your money."}
{"text":"A l'occasion du depart d'une colleague de travail, j'ai reservé une table de 10 malgré les très mauvais commentaires sur Yelp. Le décor est moderne et la grande salle à manger est parfaite pour les groupes. Nous avons tous pris des plats différents allant du risotto , au filet de saumon en passant par les pates. Tous ont été satisfaits. Belle présentation des plats avec légumes frais. 
Le service fut impeccable des notre arrivée. Sceaux à vin sur la table, ne pas manquer de pain et aucune erreur de commande. Les prix sont raisonnable et le stationnement est très grand."}
{"text":"We loved it! The food was amazing and the service was wonderful. The different course options had an array of dishes to offer. There were 6 guests at our table and our servers were very attentive. Not only were the courses delicous but the wine selection was too, and so affordable ($20 per BOTTLE). We were all stunned by how well the students prepared our dishes, everything was cooked and presented perfecly. The biggest shock comes when the bill is delivered. $12 for a 3 course/5 star meal is unheard of!!  We've told many about our dinner experience and will be back again. Everyone shoud get to this restaurant asap!"}
{"text":"Kaylie our waitress was great. Personable, knowledgeable and doesn't beat around the bush.

The mussels' sauce was great (Roquefort) but that's to be expected as I order it every time from every location and it always hits the mark. The bread was warm when delivered to the table which is always key. There were a number of the mussels that weren't properly cleaned however. We ordered the lasagna as it's one of the only pastas made in-house. It didn't have as much of the mushroom or meat that the menu would have led me to believe, but the noodles and sauce were great, there was enough cheese, and the dish was good.

Would I have paid full price for this meal ($19 usually, weekday discounts push it down to $14), not really. I would have lacked the \"oumph\". But hey, it's decent food, BYOW, and the location itself is visually pleasing. Looks like a hit-or-miss based on other reviews."}
{"text":"Arrived early to ask the host questions regarding my food allergies, and to my dismay, most of the seafood dishes were off-limits due to shrimp stock inclusion in the cream sauces.  Since this is a culinary institute, the staff cannot stray from the recipes and skills students must perfect in order to graduate.  Lucky for me, there were still a few items I could order and enjoy w/out worry, but I wanted to stay along the vegetarian path just in case Amber wanted to have a try at my dishes.

I was fortunate enough to have Christina and Amber join me for dinner.  I thank you two for taking time out of your busy day to meet me!  I also thank Christina for introducing me to Molly Dooker Cab.  I had a nice Chardonnay.  I must ask Amber which one it was since she also had a glass of it (C., do you remember what we had?)

For starters, we all shared the cheese plate, which Christina already described in her review.  I really enjoyed the manchego and brie on the buttered crostini with the pistachios, pecans, and grapes.  The figs and apricots looked wonderful, but they're on my food allergy suspicion list, and I did not want to risk ruining a great dinner experience with these two women at my side!  For our apps, Christina ordered the wonderful-sounding 7-onion soup; Amber ordered the salad special;  and I had the onion-wrapped ahi-tuna spinach feta salad.  I could have had this salad for my app, meal, and dessert!  (It also had lovely pear sticks and a sweet dressing.)

While Christina was satisfied with the cheese plate and onion soup, Amber and I had other plans!  She ordered the sweet potato gnocchi with a white wine cream sauce.  I had almost ordered this one, but the host talked me out of it.  I had a taste of it and found it flavorful and light at the same time, despite it having a cream sauce.  The white wine helped keep it from being too heavy or greasy.  I ordered the vegetable panini- roasted tomatoes, red bell peppers, arugula, olives, and fontina on pumpernickle with cilantro aïoli and gaufrettes as my side (very thin waffle-cut potato crisps- delightful!).  The panini was a hit!!  Amber said she'd order it the next time she comes here.  Heck, I'd probably order it again along with another dish and share with the table.  The panini and gaufrettes surprisingly survived refrigeration and were easily rejuvenated using a toaster-oven.

Now you'd think all that food was enough, but Amber and I had a sweet-tooth to satisfy, and that we did with the apple fritters coated with cinnamon-sugar and topped with a housemade vanilla ice cream, pecans,  and caramel.  This dessert originally comes with a vanilla-walnut semifreddo, but I had to sub plain vanilla to avoid an allergen.  I thank Amber for sharing this fine dessert with me, although we did think that the vanilla ice cream tasted a little off (I thought it tasted like it sat in the freezer for a long time.)

I plan to visit more often to try the other paninis and menu items."}
{"text":"The host that greeted us at the front was in a full length black apron, very professional. All of the waiters were very professional, and a shout out to the awkward water boy that dropped by a few times. Billy was the name of our server, a very personable young man who very much deserves a raise. 

Okay, so maybe this place is a bit better than a Jack Astor's. We're seated in the window, and are tended to quite regularly. The bread basket that we received was quite small, but after a few times filling it, they figured out that we're bread-eaters. It began to come back full to the brim. The white baguette wasn't sliced all the way through, the outside was crusty, the crumb was perfect, and it was slightly warmed. No wonder I ate so much of it. The whole grain roll was great as well. I'm not a big fan of birdseed bread, but it was quite exceptional. Over dinner, I get more of a background on this place. It was apparently an offshoot of a bunch of chefs that went to school together. So far, this is the best example of everything I learned in school, they're doing everything right. 

Eventually our meals came, a risotto and my chicken fillet in pink peppercorn sauce. His plate of risotto was filled with mushrooms and looked quite appetizing. My meal was a full one. The plate was stylized, and for the better. Two large chicken breasts that were cooked to perfection. Perfectly moist coated in a pink peppercorn cream sauce. Oh, it was heavenly. To add to this, tasty roasted potatoes, a carrot with the green top, three asparagus, and some shredded gourd of some kind. It was very delicious. 

I only have one negative aspect of this dish. Not that there wasn't enough food, because I had to have Uncle Larito help me finish it, but that the peppercorns were overpowering. I understand that it's a pink peppercorn sauce, but the same powerful taste could have come from some crushed peppercorns rather than a bunch of whole ones. While whole peppercorns are nice, there were so many that I had to scrape them off of my chicken and I found it quite unpleasant to bite into them. Every bite had at least five whole peppercorns if I had not scraped them off. It really put me off trying to finish my dish. 

Larito's risotto was exceptional. I am not a pasta fan, but this was perfectly spiced and had very full flavours. Good job!

Over coffees, which were fine, we ordered dessert. I ordered the carrot cake and Larito decided to talk to Billy about which of the desserts came recommended. The carrot cake and chocolate mousse were at the top, next down was the crème caramel and the crème brulee, and finally, the cheesecake. 

Larito decided to go with the brulee. It was quite well done, and was house-made. The sugar was torched perfectly and was made with the richness of extra yolks. It was a little less sweet than I would have liked, but Uncle Larito was satisfied with it. I am sceptical about the cake slice that I received. I adore carrot cake. The cream cheese icing, the moist carrot cake with the abundance of spices that float about the cake is like heaven on Earth. Alas, this cake was not satisfactory. The plating was quite nice, it came with a treble clef drawn on the plate in crème anglaise with the slice next to it. 

The carrot cake consisted of four thin layers of orange cake that were surrounded by a unicorn mayonnaise icing of some kind. There was no cream cheese flavour, not even the acidity to suggest that it had once been cream cheese. The orange cake had no spices, it was just masquerading as carrot cake. If I had to guess, I would assume that this is a LaRocca cake or something similar. 

I would recommend investing in a better bakery to supply your desserts or at least try to make them in house. If this cannot be done, please remove the cake out of the fridge before service. Also, plating with crème anglaise wasn't beneficial to the plate. While the colours matched, this is only half of the battle. Please, choose something that isn't creamy, even a nice tangerine sauce, a spiced brandy sauce would have been wonderful, or even some spice to your crème anglaise would have been quite nice. I was also a little worried as to if the sauce was really a crème anglaise, or if it was the uncooked remnants from the crème brulee. In which case, if it was, I do hope that the eggs were pasteurized in some way. I actually didn't eat the sauce due to the fact that it might not have been safe for me to eat. 

All in all, I had a wonderful experience. I would return, and I do hope that this chain makes its way to Ontario. The decor was fabulous, the menu was well planned, and the staff was amazing. It was a little too expensive for my taste, even though what we did get (minus the dessert) was well worth the price. Great job, L'Academie. You've impressed me."}
{"text":"Just went for lunch.  The reason that I gave them 2 stars is because the restaurant itself is nice.  First impressions,  dirty plate(s).  Bread plate, soup bowl both dirty.  Not horribly but makes you pause.  We ordered calamari starter and myself the chef special ( which was a pork loin in a mustard sauce) and my husband ordered muscles.  The calamari was horrible, sitting in oil, yet cool and slightly raw.  Freezer burn tasting, and overall not tasty, just salty.  When the waitress asked I told her, her response was \"Oh well.\" Shrugged and off she went.  
We finally got our soup- cold dirty bowl.  Left mine uneaten.  Waited quit a while but finally got our main course.  One part on the top of the plate was hot, the rest cold again.  Portions were small( I mean one carrot, 3 baby potatoes, 6 green beans and few small pieces of pork) the only \"hot\" thing was the pork the sauce was bechamel not mustard.  Not finished either.  And I was hungry! 
My husbands was also cold, very small fries portion and not very tasty either.  No bread given to dip into the sauce.  To top it off, they gave him mayo which had a horrible yellow skin on it.  See picture. 
The service was slow ( took well over an hour and it was not busy).  
Will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"As a Cordon Blue cooking school/restaurant this restaurant has big shoes to fill. They do so admirably!  The food, flavors, and presentation are marvelous...there is definitely no shortage of interesting flavor combinations. Even when things aren't to your liking there is something delicious about each dish. For example: The raspberry/cherry sauce on the Black Forest cake was a bit too rich for me....but overall the dessert was delicious. 

Eating at a cooking school, which doesn't look like a school at all by the way, is a novel experience. I'm glad I had the opportunity to enjoy the dinner and ambiance they provided. It is going to the top of the \"everyone should try this\" list."}
{"text":"Last night, after about a month of planning, the surprise party I had organized (with the help of a few people) for my best friend Jess,  was pulled off with much success.

We had dinner at L'Academie in Pointe Claire.  I had never been there before but Jess has been there several times and she loves it.

All I wanted was the escargot but did not think many people would be getting the appetizers so I refrained- with much regret.  Jess let me try one of her escargots and they were amazing.

Ant got the Mussels and I got the Atlantic Salmon.

I must say, I was not impressed and Ant was not a fan either.  It was the first time I did not ask for a doggie bag and I think that is an indication of my feelings toward the meal.  Jess got a dessert for free since it was her birthday but even that was... odd.  They said it was ice cream but it looked more like whipped cream with crumbs put on it.  It was strange.

This restaurant is BYOW and I am glad we brought a bottle to share.  Although, I must say that the atmosphere is pretty great.  It seems to be too formal for there to be the big screens they had but I am happy that I was able to see the hockey score in the background.  The staff is very friendly and I even ran to an old coworker of mine which was a nice surprise.

Overall, I am happy I had the company I did but I don't think I'll be returning to this restaurant.  To each their own though!  If you go there, I hope you have a better experience and let me know!  They have more than one location so maybe going to another one would make a difference."}
{"text":"Qualité très mauvaise pour les prix vraiment élevés ! Très grosse portion qui permet aux propriétaires de nous charger aussi chez pour de la nourriture très normal de très basse qualité !"}
{"text":"The restaurant was beautiful inside. All the white table clothes and wine glasses, and white couch seats, with high ceilings created a very lovely and comfortable ambiance. The bathrooms were clean, and the service wasn't bad. I did however had a real problem with the food though... I went there on a date about 3 years ago maybe, and I still remember the flies that were bothering us, and how bad my meal was. Not only was it not warm, but the sauce had no flavor, it was worse than cafeteria food. I just found my experience so odd, because usually pasta is the easiest dish to make, and I'm never a picky eater. I was too scared to return my plate and ask for a remake, in case I get spit in it or something lol so I just ate as much as I could, which was half, and leave the rest. I'm not interested in going back there really... Maybe I would though one day, since it's been such a long time that they must have improved. I think it was the cheese ravioli with a rose sauce I had. I still loved being inside though, was very elegant, and I like how we can bring our own wine. Kind of noisy though because of all the families with children there, I mean I like going to restaurants with kids too, but it would be smarter to have a different section for customers with kids though, especially since this restaurant is so big, they could do it if they wanted to, and it would please everyone."}
{"text":"I was seated at the bar. A very nice young man was working the bar an provided good conversation.

I was offered a DELICIOUS chicken, bacon, bleu cheese amuse. Yum!

I ordered a pine nut pesto pizza, which wad delivered by the chef! :)

The crust was perfect! Thick enough for structure and substance, but thin enough to \"hide\" behind the flavors of tomato and pine nut pesto.
The cheese was also just right.

Delicious!

I also had the chicken panini, which was fantastic! The bread was a bit hard, but I think I was too busy talking and let it sit too long.

All in all I'd definitely recommend L'Academie if you're in that area of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"L'academie is a beautiful restaurant that serves simple French/Italian food at affordable prices.
Noticeably, if you come on Sunday to Thursday, they have a 12$ pasta or mussel special which comes with salad or soup of the day. 
You get a basket of bread with every meal.

I wouldn't recommend paying full price otherwise because their pasta dishes can be upwards of 18$ which isn't that worth it.

I've tried their spaghetti bolognaise sauce, alfredo and smoked saumon alfredo pastas which were all delicious.
Their alfredo sauce is extremely creamy but it doesn't have that hint of garlic or enough buttery taste to really satisfy me.

I've never had an issue with service, fast, prompt, efficient.

Washroom perks: free dental floss dispenser!"}
{"text":"My wife and I shared mussels Italian and coquille something or the other. The mussels were decent but the coquille was really superb.

Service was a bit slow but not too bad to crib about. 

We sat outside and enjoyed the bistro atmosphere."}
{"text":"You double check if you're in the right restaurant. Did you just accidentally walk into a 5 star hotel? Nope, it's L'Academie. The air is amazingly spacious and the decor is luxurious. But what matters most is the food right? Unfortunately, it didn't quite do it for me. I had the matane shrimp poutine and the gravy was a dense garlic sauce. The shrimps were overpowering and the richness of the gravy-sauce was too much for me. Although I must admit that the fries were good - beautiful golden brown, the perfect kind for poutine. I also tried the duck and mushroom risotto which didn't impress me. The consistency of the rice was closer to congee (rice porridge) and the duck was on the dryer side. The place was somewhat busy. I guess it's because L'Academie can offer a feel of modern luxury at a more affordable price, which is a good thing."}
{"text":"This is quite a nice place, cozy and vast. Lovely atmosphere. Food is great! Staff is great! There is not much to say... Umm yeah, just go and you'll see!"}
{"text":"I have to say for my first time going i tried there sausage, pancetta poutine i liked it will have to try other dishes that they make"}
{"text":"What really bothers me the most about this place is the terrible service overall. We got seated at 6:05PM and our server got assigned to us 35 minutes later. We had to wait for bread for another 10-15 minutes, we had to serve our own wine, etc. Then the food came and while the mussels were decent, people with pastas had barely any sauce with chewy pastas to top this up. The fries with the  mussels were mushy and barely hot. All of this was on a Sunday night with half the restaurant empty. The only redeeming part was our server who was a delight. I had banished this restaurant in the past for similar experience, it is now back on the ban list."}
