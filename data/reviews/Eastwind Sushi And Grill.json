{"text":"One word... GAG!!!

Don't come when they are about to close! Nasty... I feel sick now. Panda Express would have been 100x better... I really feel sick writing this! First sushi place that only had 1 Japanese person and they weren't making sushi.

I want to be fair, that's why I didn't give them a 1 star rating... I've been her before when they were busy and it was pretty good (as good as you expect from a 2.00 a plate sushi) don't expect quality... Not here, no way....."}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch of delicious sushi from the endless conveyor belt of $2 plates. I got a little carried away, but it was really good. The menu looked good too, but I didn't try anything. This one will be in the regular rotation for sure."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 starts because my husband and I come here very often. Is it the most amazing sushi in the entire world? No. But for the price, you cant beat it. It always tastes good and fresh. The service here has always been amazing- So attentive, but not annoying. Always greeted with a smile. They have an appetizer that is sometimes on the rotation, but sometimes we just order it. It's mushrooms fried stuffed with crab- AMAZING! Even if you order them, they are only about $4. We usually order those, get some sake and take quite a few plates off the rotation and end up spending about $40. To fill up on pretty good sushi and a reasonable price, with a drink each, is a great deal- not to mention we have NEVER had bad service here. We will continue to frequent this place!"}
{"text":"Hot. Mess. No other way to describe the fact the sushi belt had no plates as it rotated endlessly, leaving hungry diners staring longingly for some morsel of food.

Service staff was frantic, literally running between tables. We were sat by a frazzled waitress who forgot about  us after dropping off our drinks. After sitting and watching the sushi-less sushi belt go by  for about 10 minutes, we got up and paid for the drinks we didn't even consume. What did frazzled waitress do? Not even acknowledge or apologize for
the lack of service.

I wanted to support this small local restaurant but rest assured I will not be back any time soon, many more deserving establishments out there who deserve the support."}
{"text":"Very so so to go.  Then they did not include my wasabi on top of it!  They said some people don't like it?  What!  Asian food is my favorite but this doesn't rate in comparison to my local Dana Kai in Dana Point, Ca.  Need to work on their recipes!"}
{"text":"It would be nice if there was a paper  menu available for people to reference should they want takeout. Or a website..."}
{"text":"Sushi is all priced very well. You have a huge selection to choose from and for such a steal. Fun environment too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. You walk in, and sit down at the conveyor belt/sushi bar and every kind of sushi you could ever want is available to you immediately. Im all about that instant gratification so I love the see food, grab food, eat food concept. Maybe this is just me, but actually getting a plate of sushi from a moving belt makes me feel really accomplished too.
So while I love the finer things in life like sushi, I am also cheap. This place is still bomb. Every single plate on the conveyor belt is $2 at lunch.....AND at dinner!!!!
There are 2-3 pieces in every plate, and whoever thinks that isn't a deal can't do math.
The only thing I would recommend is if you want some fried stuff like dumplings, wait until it comes out steaming, avoid the ones that have been circling for a while.
The only other thing I might mention is you have to like spicy stuff. They go really heavy on those spicy rolls with jalape√±os and chipotle mayo.
And even though your server doesn't have to bring you plates, please tip them well!"}
{"text":"I love this place my husband and I walk here almost everyday o have zero bad things to say staff was polite, nice and helpful. C'mon! Two dollar sushi plate?!!!? Cannot go wrong with that!! And it's most rolls and specialty rolls so you can basically taste the whole menu! And as for their entrees all great cooled well :) super great job guys!!! Keep it up!! I would bring all my family if I could!"}
{"text":"Great price for what you get. Can't beat the price! Sushi is ok, nothing great but not bad either. Will definitely go back when I need a quick fix."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time on a Friday afternoon.
Small place, cozy and tvs around.
I love the $2.00 plates that come around on the revolving counter.  Just grab what you want and eat.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have a 8 month old baby and it's a great place for my husband and I to go for a quick date. Sushi is great!"}
{"text":"A few people from work go here a couple of times per month.  We've had great experiences and not so great experiences. 

Pros: 
Food is good when it's fresh and not on the conveyor belt too long.
Quick & convenient way to have lunch during the work week.
Great price $2 a plate.

Cons:
Had lipstick on a water glass once.
Hair under a piece of sushi once.
Service can be slow if you're ordering off the menu."}
{"text":"Dollar per slice of sushi. Not all, but most plates had 2 pieces on them. Also 3/4 of the plates had eel sauce them. But the sushi was good"}
{"text":"I love revolving sushi,  and when this place was recommended to me,  I just had to try it.  I was very pleased! All of the sushi was fresh,  two to three pieces each place was the perfect size,  and the price can't be beat.  It's only $2a plate.  Love it! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the strangest places I have ever been in my life.

Let me cut to the chase: The food is on a conveyor belt and it moves around and if you want it, you have to grab it off of the conveyor belt. They have normal tables too and a normal menu, but it seems like that's just for people without the agility to get the real food, or maybe they came in and were too embarrassed to sit at the conveyor belt, but also too embarrassed to leave so they just acted like everything was normal and sat at a normal table, but guess what people: IT ISNT NORMAL AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT.

Also, when we went there was a lot of smoke in the place, and the lady running the joint was very appologetic and said that the fan in the kitchen had broken and that they were getting it repaired immediately, but honestly I think she was trying to distract people and increase the difficulty of getting the food. I don't know why she would do this because she seemed like a very nice woman, but I just have a feeling. Either way, it's gonna take more than some smoke to keep me from getting food when I'm hungry! We sat at the conveyor belt bar thing and the food came around and before I knew it I had snagged 7 plates and was feeling kind of funny from all the saki and smoke and it was a great time. To make things easier every plate was $2 so the math was east to do to figure out if I should keep eating more food or not.

So this place was pretty fun. It's not sushi like at a really good sushi place, but it's not stale old sushi either. I'd say it's a step above sushi you'd get in the grocery store, and the price is reasonable, and holy cow what a time."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised. 
Friendly customer service. 
Great food. 
Family friendly ambience."}
{"text":"Good sushi, and a fun time. A good place to take a casual first date. The staff is very nice. The belt always had something I wanted to try, or have another one of. At dinner on a Friday at 5:30pm it was not crowded at all."}
{"text":"Love this place! 
Great sushi for a great price. 
We visit this place at least 3 - 4 times a month.
Definitely eat here!"}
{"text":"I first enjoyed conveyor sushi at eastwinds. I have since traveled the country and, to my surprise, Eastwinds remains the best conveyor sushi experience. It is by far the best conveyor sushi experience in the east valley. The quality of the sushi on the belt is high and consistent. Pricing is constant at $2 a plate. Find your way here and enjoy!! My favorite: the ocean plate and the crab bake plate."}
{"text":"Always great, come here a few times a year and never sorry.  Prices are low and quality is there.  Come here."}
{"text":"Terrible quality food. Plates were warm. Sushi didn't taste fresh. Everything had fatty dressing on it. Would not recommend it at all. Even the wasabi was not hot at All! Seemed like it was fake too. Do not waste your money here."}
{"text":"Went during lunch time for the sushi bar. They were playing old 2000s pop music which I LOVED. Love that it's $2 per plate so it's easy to calculate the total. There wasn't too much of a variety of sushi, but it was fine compared to other revolving sushi bars, and they were no gyoza going around even tho the sign was there and there was an empty spot for them. The fried rolls weren't very crispy. Service very lackluster even though there was a decent amount of people at the bar. Another group had to hunt down a waitress to pay, and so once she was over there we got her too. Would be great if we were ever apporached of offered refills. The servers were all in the back talking. Either way I think this is great for a revolving sushi place and I would rate this 3.5 if I could. 4.5 if they had better service."}
{"text":"This place is okay. The sushi is very average and the service is a little confusing at times. I worry about the sushi on the rotating conveyer belt...I feel that sometimes it stays out for too long to be safe. I have seen rolls with raw fish on the conveyer belt from the time I arrived that are still on there when I leave. Who knows how long it was on there before I arrived and how long was it there after I left? Also I don't trust it to keep my raw fish at a safe temperature, which is why I won't eat there during the summer. 

It is just a 2 star place...there is definitely better sushi out there."}
{"text":"done eat here. got terrible food poisoning. here last friday. found out my coworker had the same experience twice too!"}
{"text":"Getting a Sushi surprise when wondering around for lunch is nice. Finding one this good makes your day. Solid sushi at a nice lunch price. I also like that they label the rolls on the belt.  

The menu looked complete, but st $2 a plate the conveyor belt was my choice. Good variety and some small portion choices like Dragon an Las Vegas rolls I don't often find on a conveyor."}
{"text":"I always weight the price-quality ratio and this place is off the chart.

Great friendly service, super decent food at ridiculous prices.

The bar has a belt where the dishes are displayed and rotating and each plate is $ 2, yes TWO dollars.

A party of two (good eaters), plenty of food (maybe a little too much), two beers (the draft is $1.99) and a soft drink for $ 27.00

I'll be back soon!

Cheers"}
{"text":"Service was good and ambience is . Sushi yummy!! We order a tan tan ramen.. it's spicy but not tat yummy.. Highly recommended place to go!"}
{"text":"I'm going to have to give this place three stars. The place was cool! A little on the small side and QUICKLY became full and busy. They sushi was pretty good, I think I would only have to \"complain\" because their sushi rolls (revolving sushi) had A LOT of cucumber in it. I guess it's their way of stretching their dollar in order to be able to make the plates only $2. Kinda a bummer. I would happily pay a little more for sushi rolls that aren't 50% cucumber."}
{"text":"This place really lacks the organization from the wait staff (waitress and kitchen staff). Two of the staff were running around, pretty clueless. They seem so overwhelmed. We didn't get water until 30 min. later, no plates and the kitchen staff allegedly lost our order slip. The restaurant is part conveyor belt and the other half is a sit down restaurant. The conveyor belt is limited in sushi dishes, pretty boring for a conveyor belt restaurant. The sushi was ok. The wait staff was the main issue for me. I will not come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is UH-MAZING... really friendly ... $2 plates of sushi .... can get all different kinds instead of just ordering one order , you can get a variety which i like! ... deff recommend going here"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Drunk obnoxious patrons, screaming children, horrible fish and minuscule portions. We were in and out within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious sushi and hand made table side cocktails! Service is excellent and offer a large variety of rolls and other dishes for the non sushi lover. Low prices. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I cannot speak to the sushi but have eaten their steak yakisoba which is delicious! Last night decided to venture out and try their ramen it was very good! Pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for sushi. I love the enviorment, but you can't beat the price. Yummy sushi at an affordable price."}
{"text":"The best conveyor belt sushi I've had in the valley so far, and at $2 a plate, it's good cheap eats. Waitstaff are always super friendly. Portions are great for the price of the food, and it's always clean. Tables and bar seats are cleaned immediately after the customer leaves. The place is usually pretty busy during dinner hours(haven't been for lunch yet), which means there's a high turnover of sushi on the conveyor belt so it's always fresh. I'm always looking for excuses to make the drive from Mesa to eat here. :)"}
{"text":"I am obsessed! That is really the best word for this place! I eat here probably 3 times a week at the least! The Sushi is amazing, and for the price UNBELIEVABLE!!! $2 a plate is out of this world! I love how nice the staff are and they always welcome you back with smiling face! They really care, I came with my mom and they ran out of pot stickers and made a fresh batch just for us!! This is by far my favorite Sushi place in town!!"}
{"text":"Excellent prices and the place is very clean but they need to work on their variety.  I go there often because my son has a class right around the corner and it is just not worth driving home then back.  A few of the rolls are good but they are the same over and over again.  Someone needs to update the menu and add more to the mix.  They also need to put more sushi out as opposed to just rolls.  

You also get the feel that some of the dishes have been sitting on the belt for too long as the rice sticks to the plate.  

This place fixes my sushi lust for a few days but when I need good sushi I have to go to Shimogamo or make the trek out to Toyama or Yasu in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Chandler!!! Prices are reasonable and food is delicious!!! The people who work there are wonderful!! I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely horrendous. I walked in, sat down at an open spot at their bar, and had to wait over ten minutes JUST to ask if I wanted a water, while their wait staff walked DIRECTLY past me four times. On top of that, after cleaning the area around me up, they let a dirty napkin and trash for a straw, apparently assuming they were mine when I didn't even have a straw in my glass. The service overall was horrendous except for the young gentleman who eventually made his wait staff realize how long I was waiting for.

Now, onto the menu. I understand basic operations as a spinnery versus a traditional diner cause you to lose some quality in food, but this is ridiculous. Ordering any of their sushi with a softer core, I.E. spicy tuna, the center is absolute mush. Anything with spice is way too strong and outweighs the remaining flavors that are supposed to be intended for sushi. Some dishes even appear as if they've been sitting and rotating for over an hour, at room temperature. Not proper temperature to serve fish at for an elongated time, as well as no timestamp on their dishes showing as to when they were initially served/placed on the spinner.

I used to love coming to this place. I may come back again, but only if the service drastically improves. Unless I get sick from fish sitting at room temp all day, then that's another story."}
{"text":"First time here and love the food. I'm visiting from Los Angeles where we have a lot of Japanese food.  This place is up there with the best. 

Nice people too. And being from LA, I can't believe how low the prices are."}
{"text":"Good, wide variaty of quality sushi for 2.00 a plate!? Yes please!  Great and friendly service too!  My new sushi place in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Great selection of sushi on the conveyor belt. Very fresh made and ingredients are crisp and tasty. Nice fun spot for lunch. Tables available or sit at the conveyor belt sushi bar. Huge menu also available with bento boxes, soups and more. Will return and try the menu items for dinner soon. Yay I found a new sushi spot that doesn't break my bank account!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi from the assembly line is pretty tasty.  They have table seating or seating up at the sushi bar.
It was unique to us.  The various items would be on small plates with a majority covered to keep them warm.  
We enjoyed the shrimp tempura, spicy shrimp & eel sauce sushi, salmon & cucumber sushi and much more.
The assembly line makes a big circle and the various items served are placed in groups.  Most of the groups have signs identifying what they are and the main ingredients.
(tip: if you see the word \"spicy\" on the sign they aren't kidding)
The chefs are always looking to see which groups are being taken by customers and they'll add more.
The \"chef special\" signs would come around but there was nothing to identify what it was so we passed on those.
Our daughter is vegan so they will whip up something fast for her.  

It's like walking into a dollar store where everything is a dollar.   Except here each plate is $2 and your tab is calculated by how many of the small plates are remaining with you.

My only suggestion is for them to lower the price of the house wine.  At $5.50 it might be more appropriate to have it priced at $3.50.

The customer service was outstanding.  It was our first time there and one of the employees explained the system.

We will be returning again soon!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first experience at Eastwind. The food was amazing, loved the conveyor belt, reasonable pricing!! Seriously good vibes, and customer service was great! Definitely can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great, but definitely better than most go-round sushi places out here.

I've been to the other sushi-go round establishments in the valley and honestly I've hated every one of them. Dry, warm, flat unsavory fish and nasty rice. The sushi here is decent, it's not amazing, it's not worth returning for in force, it's okay though.

Service was okay, honestly you don't really need much of a server here, just pick items and pay.

The one thing EastWind has going is that they offer different, fresher ideas. There are a lot of spicy rolls, customized rolls, rolls with unique flavors and whatnot, but otherwise it's pretty average. The decor and setting is cleaner and neater than most small little restaurants too, not bad to sit down in.

I was kind of surprised how they didn't have any salmon or yellowtail anywhere, those are staples of Japanese cuisine, that's like opening a grill without offering a burger and fries.

Also, they need to fix the sink in the bathroom...the hot handle doesn't work and the cold handle barely works...washing hands with hot water is important people, please work on this*"}
{"text":"Disappointing. The sushi on the conveyor was pretty warm. Some of the signs didn't match the sushi. They forgot my boyfriend's green tea. Everything was $2, which would be cheap if it wasn't mediocre. I can get cheaper sushi somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have eaten here two times, first on the Summer and the last one on Winter. I made the distinction because i found the sushi tastier and a tad fresher on the former than the latter. Maybe my taste buds is sharper during the dry hot season, but the eating experience is definitely more unforgettable. If you are planning to eat here on the cold months, i would recommend that you have a hot green tea with your sushi; it just feel less fishy and bloated with it.

What made me come back and most likely would made me come back again is the enjoyment of sitting on the bar counter and watching the revolving belt with plates of sushi/rolls beautifully arranged for the diner's eye. Two dollar per plate is very reasonable, some have two or three rolls, but the real treat is watching the sushi chef made his magic on his mini kitchen adjoining the counter.

Eastwind is centrally and quietly located in Downtown Chandler and a nice mix from the other restaurants around. The tables are generally well kept and i think the rather dim interior compliments the harsh sun outside. The waiters and waitresses are warm and helpful on sushi/menu-related questions, and also quick on the service. New or expert sushi lovers should give this place a try."}
{"text":"This place is perfect when you're just craving some rolls!  I like the Sedona, the Booty Booty, the Dynamite, the NY Crunch.. waiting to try more next time.  Already have been back.. and YES, everything on the conveyor belt is $2, and Asahi drafts are $2."}
{"text":"I love this sushi go - round style restaurant. It's in downtown chandler and a place my family and guests often enjoy eating.  This place is great if you want tasty sushi that is quick and simple, and low cost. I also order off the menu for bent boxes with tempura, tariyaki or Katsu options. Everything is tasty good here and prices are very reasonable. It is somewhat small so on weekends there may be a short wait but downtown offers such a local and intimate yet family oriented atmostphere, so we don't mind the wait."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Went here last Friday for \"date night\" with my wife. It was a good atmosphere and clean. There is a table that rotates at the bar and several different types of sushi fill the table. As it goes by you pick what you want to eat. As people take things the cooks/chefs replace the items or change the items and the table continues to rotate. All plates were $2 each and you pay based on how many plates you accumulate. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I've been to plenty of revolving sushi restaurants in Arizona and this has to be my favorite! The sushi was fresh  and affordable. Customer was great and the location is in a beautiful shopping plaza. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Good stuff, great start to my nieces birthday weekend she and I both love sushi this place served a great bento-box with a great assortment of chicken tempura and  wontons"}
{"text":"Food goes above and beyond in creativity and flavor.

Upon first visit, there is something to be said about parking. It is interesting, but worth walking over the rubble even in high heels. 

There is a very welcoming feel as you are greeted. The staff is very friendly and attentive. And the rolls!!!! No waiting here you simply pick what you like off of the heavenly rotating appetizing rolls. 

Definitely try the octopus and climax roll. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is really good and the staff is quite friendly and helpful. The place has a rotating belt with sushi on it. With $2 a plate, the small portion allows you to try all kinds of different sushi that roll your way. There are also other options other than sushi as well. They also have a menu to order other things beside sushi. I enjoy eating their fried oysters as well."}
{"text":"Love the sushi here! It's a go to spot if you want decent sushi without the wait. Fish is fresh and each plate is 2 dollars!"}
{"text":"A real enjoyable experience! The rolls were prepared well and tasted great. I went there twice in 1 day. I give the staff kudos for they're attentiveness. I would suggest Eastwind to anybody who loves sushi when in Chandler,Arizona."}
{"text":"Great place for inexpensive sushi. Love the setup (sushi conveyor belt). Every plate is $2, and Kirin pints are $2 as well. They have a proper menu too, but I've always stuck to the bar seating with $2 plates. It's nothing exotic, but well worth the money."}
{"text":"Small and cool atmosphere. The conveyor belt of sushi was fun but didn't have a lot of variety, it started out with a lot of spicy sushi. It's cheap and affordable. I'm not sure if it was the chefs or the menu, but some sushi didn't come out the way we had at other places. We ordered off the menu and ordering something that we had before that was suppose to be fried and warm, came out plain and cold. Friendly and quick service though."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi train and service is great and quick. Not the most exotic sushi, but you don't expect that on a train, right? A hidden gem."}
{"text":"I've been to a few revolving belt sushi bars in Arizona and Eastwind is one of my faves. With $2 plates and everything is fresh, the chefs keep the belt full during lunch hours you can't beat that! 
The music was playing kinda loud and I felt like I was almost yelling but it was bearable. It's located in downtown chandler and parking is a bit of a pain but no biggie we always find a spot."}
{"text":"I LLOOVVEE this place... It is Awsome... The food is great, the atmosphere is very laid back... The staff is very friendly and accomadating... The restaurant is extremely clean, and I erge everyone to to try it.... The conveyor belt takes dining to a whole other level.."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday and it was pretty slow. The issue with that is the sushi is staying longer and longer on the belt, and I am not sure how people aren't getting sick at this place. We decided to leave I would skip this place unless you want to take a chance."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place and their sushi rolls! I'm a big fan of spicy rolls and they have a large selection of different types to choose from. I've gone to other rotating sushi bars in the valley and they all seem relatively the same in price. This place is smaller that others so don't really expect to go here with a large party. I would've given it a higher rating except that they never cleaned up the seat next to me while I was there. I guess it was a good thing because then I wouldn't be bothered with any cleaning materials and smells while I'm eating, but at the same time I didn't like the thought of someone else's dirty dishes sitting next to me. 
I'll definitely have to come back during a weekend night to see how the ambiance is."}
{"text":"$2 a plate for revolving sushi bar. Really fun atmosphere and servers were really nice.. The sushi wasn;t the best, but for $2 a plate- you can't expect the same quality for sushi you play more than double for. I will say the New York Crunch roll was tasty and if you are just trying to grab a quick bite before walking around downtown, it's a nice option."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff!

$2 Sushi Plates!

Lots of choices!

Neighborhood type feel!

I just moved nearby and this will definitely be my favorite spot for casual eats nearby. 

I only had one complaint....the fried rolls get a little soggy sitting with the lids on them going round and round.  Maybe vented lids?"}
{"text":"Ok... Pretty decent revolving sushi joint where every plate is $2. A bargain right?  WRONG!  Every plate is tiny tiny so if you have an appetite, expect to pay $15 to $20 or more per person.  Boooooo!"}
{"text":"Decided to try out Eastwind after a couple friends and I had seen it was open last month.

Recently, I have been addicted to Teharu as it has a similar conveyer belt system but after trying out Eastwind I highly doubt I will be going back to Teharu!

The presentation of the sushi was fantastic!  The Rainbow Roll actually looked edible compared to Teharu's.  In general, they had much higher quality fish compared to the aforementioned sushi joint.

Overall, if you're hungry for a quick bite of sushi, I'd definitely try this place out!

I'll be back!

:)"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. Now there is a new owner and he even added noodles! Great service fresh sushi and the belt was full with all types of yummy rolls. We also had the cheesecake for desert and was the best all around. Was fwd the best it has ever been.  Way to go and hats off to the new ower!! well be back again for sure. only $2 a plate!Amazing!"}
{"text":"Yikes! what happened to this place?  it used to be a great place to grab a quick Friday sushi dinner with the family, now it is pretty nasty. the place is very unkempt and smelly. Not a good idea for Sushi. I guess because of the low price the management feels cleanliness is optional?"}
{"text":"The restaurant has the revolving sushi (if that's what it's called) but you can also sit at tables.  I thought the sushi was very fresh and they had a fair selection.  What I loved is each plate has 2 - 4 pieces of sushi and costs only $2 per plate!  I've already come here twice and will probably be the only sushi place I go to from now on!"}
{"text":"Always delicious. There was a ton of sushi up for grabs at the go-around. Service was fast and friendly. I love coming here for lunch when I am in the area"}
{"text":"The only reason I like this place is because the sushi plates are $2 and you can literally walk in, sit down and start eating. I had the California roll, Climax roll and shrimp tempura. The California was so so. It tasted like sushi out of the supermarket. Super crunchy vegetables were inside (which I can't stand). The climax roll ended up having cream cheese in it when it clearly says it doesn't on the description and the shrimp tempura was \"okay\". It was tasty, however, unacceptably cold. I was hoping to have at least a 3 star experience coming here considering the Yelp reviews say it's amazing. But I'd rather stick to Pearl and pay 7.50 for a roll, at least I know it's fresh and will be delicious."}
{"text":"Great place for good sushi! Very family friendly and nice for a quick lunch date. We've been coming here for years and we love it. Great food, amazingly nice staff and even better prices!"}
{"text":"If you're an indecisive eater or just want to try a bit of everything, then this is the place for you! Items circle around the bar area to all customers on a conveyor belt for them to grab as they please. New items get added every 3 minutes or so and they include a description card so you know what you're getting yourself into! I love how it's not just sushi and includes shrimp tempura, edamame, octopus, egg rolls, etc. so everyone can enjoy themselves. Never fear, all rolls are covered so it is sanitary. Service is prompt and if you let them know what you're in the mood for they will have the chef add it to the conveyor belt!"}
{"text":"I Love this Place! I have a soft spot for affordable \"Bang for your Buck\" locations with quality food. My husband and I drove to eat at the Italian restaurant a few doors down but was welcomed with a Closed sign on a Tuesday. I then saw the banner sign showing $1.99 beer and $2 Sushi. I was like SCORE!!

They have a small menu for $2 but everything on their sushi rotating belt is $2. The service was good and venue is nothing out of the ordinary.

I wish I can take this restaurant home with me to California.. 

Until next time Eastwind Sushi and Grill.."}
{"text":"Seeking out a great sushi spot, keep seeking.  They have Thai and Chinese food on the menu too....hardly anything for us to eat.  Unless you eat raw fish that is not fresh and not temp controlled.  Common sense would have told us not to go...next time we will listen to our inner voice of common sense."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for lunch today and it was just ok. I'm new to eating sushi so I don't have a lot to compare it to. I also play it safe sticking to things like California and Shrimp Tempura rolls. We sat at the bar and sampled some of the conveyor belt sushi. The spicy California roll and shrimp tempura roll were both ok. Some of it wasn't rolled very tight and fell apart. We also sampled the shrimp tempura which was crispy, but pretty flavorless. We ordered the Pad Thai to share and I thought it was pretty gross. It was very sweet and watery and the ingredients didn't seem very fresh. Overall this place wasn't bad, but not good either. The $2 sushi plates lured me in but I could have easily eaten 10 of those which would have gotten pricy. And it got busy on a week day at about 11:30 and the service was pretty unorganized. We didn't get drink refills and had to go to the register to get our check. They could have used another employee or two."}
{"text":"First time eating sushi and the conveyer belt was such a nice way to experience it. Each plate is $2 which includes 3 pieces and has some description of the ingredients. This is super helpful considering this was my first time eve eating sushi and I have several food allergies. The staff was nice but you do not have much interaction with them if you are sitting at the bar. When visiting on a Saturday night they had Sangria and margaritas for $6 and they don't skimp on the alcohol. Great experience and can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"My most favorite sushi place ever. I bring my two small kids here all the time. And no problem if they don't like what they pick out, for 2$ and with a wide variety they can try again and I'll eat their leftover no problem (:"}
{"text":"I went with my friends after church and it was so empty on a Sunday which I was surprised but the service and food was impeccable! Super affordable sushi, can't beat $2 a plate and the conveyor belt offered lots of options! I had a lot of fun there with my friends and we left the place happy and stuffed to the gills! :D Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"It was $2 a plate sushi, awesome!

The service: was sorely lacking here, it was pretty clear that the servers gave priority to the people at the bar as I was not the only table to get ignored. We had to get up and ask for everything, water, straws, food. That was not fun. The plus was that the food came out quick. 

The entree: was so disappointing, it barely had enough food covering the plate it came in, was swimming in too much flavorless broth and the meat nuggets were dry. The side of vegetables it came with had a little bit of cabbage and tough onions. The noodles were the only good part. 

The sushi: tasted great! however dishes that came fried were cold and dishes like sashimi came warm so when my stomach was upset later I was not surprised."}
{"text":"Not very good at all. Revolving tray was always empty, tasted old, very poor selection, and service was to be desired.  So many Sushi places...I'll never go back! 
..after spending over 75.00 for 4 adults."}
{"text":"Great sushi,  great value!   Astrid and Rose are super friendly!  We came here for our daughter's birthday.  The staff fulfilled our request to send her cake down the sushi conveyor belt.  When it arrived in front of her,  the staff surrounded her to sing.  What a great experience for her.  Thank you Eastwind for making her birthday dinner extra special :)"}
{"text":"First impression:  Loud.  They crank the music.  After listening a few minutes it was not English.  Maybe Japanese top 40 music?  Probably appropriate.

They have one of those conveyor belts for the sushi if you sit at the bar.  We took a table and ordered off the menu.  We both got bento boxes.

First came the miso soup.  It had a strong flavor, and was salty.  Not my favorite.

The chicken Katsu in the bento was pretty good.  The teriyaki chicken had a sort of charred taste to it.  I didn't really like it.  The \"steak\" strips were almost flavorless.  Yes, they tasted like beef but very weakly.  Kinda strange.  I didn't try the cucumber salad stuff.  My wife likes that sort of thing so I gave it to her.  She seemed to like it.  I did eat the sushi pieces that were included.  Very little flavor there also.  The calamari salad was a pile of calamari on top of a pile of leaves (spinach, I think).  The calamari was cooked properly, not too tough or chewy, and the flavor was fine.

So overall:  underwhelming.  Not bad, but nothing to get excited about either.  There are some better options out there for sushi and for general Japanese food."}
{"text":"Today is the third time here the first two times i would have given it 5 stars. Its cheap its good. Now the first tine we ordered bento b and it was so good that we ordered it again this time. Yet, this time the chicken was horrible im positive it was old chicken my son had some then when my husband tried it he knew something was off. So we just didnt eat much just tried it. then we have my son miso soup. When we got home my son got the worst diarrhea i had ever seen and me and my husband have the worst  stomach ache. Yeah we will never come back oh and they forgot to give me my ademame but still charged me. I hate to say all this i loved it my first two times there."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I was staying at the hotel across the street, and didn't know where to eat. Although there are plenty of restaurants in the area, I liked that this place had $2 sushi plates on a conveyor belt! My experience here was awesome. Fresh sushi and a pretty good variety. My only complaint is that they are a little on the slow slide for replenishing the rolls when there's a lot of people in there. Other than that, I would highly recommended this place."}
{"text":"If all the restaurants in the area are closed and your super hungry, this is the place for you.
The food is relatively inexpensive but the quality also reflects it. The selection of the sushi on the carousel belt is very low. The food from the kitchen is also not much to talk about. I believe these people stay afloat because they're across the street from the Crowne Plaza San Marcos Resort and unknowing visitors from out-of-state are trying them. The others are locals that are coming from other nearby businesses where the line is too long and \"we\" forget to check yelp! You know the old \"I could of had a V-8\" ad where the person bonks their head, Yup \"I should checked YELP\" BONK! They get bumped to two stars for the nice server we had and that the food was $$. CHEERS!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi place in the Valley of the Sun. Great prices, fresh,  and awesome service.  Overall very happy."}
{"text":"Good fast lunch in downtown Chandler. 
We went there a bunch when they first opened... new owners, new chefs, but same in-store management. The last place we never went to because it was so bad... At first they seemed to have really changed and cleaned things up... 

We eat there once or twice a week getting food of the conveyor belt mostly... at lunch it rotates out fast and the service with drinks and checks is pretty fast. They're pretty attentive and come around often to see if things are okay and will order stuff up if it's not on the blet.. .like everybody takes the gyoza pretty fast but if you want some she'll get it made for you. And at $2/plate you can rip through 6-10 and be pretty full. 
They do have a killer bento box lunch that's pretty big but FYI... they're slow to bring that out. If your friends are doing the belt they'll be almost done by the time you get your bento box out. it's good though and a LOT of food for $8.50.

Haven't been there for dinner... I'd rather go elsewhere for killer sushi but it's a great lunch place and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Eastwind sushi is pretty ok. It's not the best sushi in the Valley by any means, but it'll do a good lunch for you. If you're going to sit at the bar and get plates (only $2/each which rocks), sit near the cooks - you'll get first dibs on everything that comes out. Sitting near the front door creates a more pleasing a friendly atmosphere for big groups, but sometimes the fresh plates don't make it to you before it's picked over! Still, if you ask the waitress or waiter to make something specific for you, they'll make a bunch of them and then you're sure to get what you want! Only downside here is it takes quite a while for drinks to arrive, and then you usually have to ask for you check - tip: ask for your check 5-10 minutes before you actually want/need to leave."}
{"text":"Really inexpensive Japanese food.

It was so unfortunate, they were very disorganized, messed up my order, perhaps understaffed? I saw sushi chef working really hard so I didn't want to complain then.

Price is very reasonable. Each lunch dish is around 6-7 dollars, sushi plate is $2 each on conveyer belt. 

Food tastes decent for the price paid. Only if their service was good..."}
{"text":"An awesome concept with amazing sushi at such great value. There is a variety of sushi, appetizers, and desserts on the conveyor belt. Our waitress was great too!"}
{"text":"First time at this place. Employees did not know the menu, they could not tell me how many pieces came on a plate (conveyor belt) verses ordering it off the menu. Then I was told that I had to order a roll off the menu because they were not busy enough to put it on the conveyor. No catering to the customer... Here is the big kicker... After I was done eating (about 10 minutes later) and getting checked out... here comes the roll that I wanted on the conveyor belt. There was only one other couple in the restaurant. Really??? I really don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Huge menu. Lots of options. The miso soup is delicious. Tofu has a great flavor and texture. The sushi belt had so many options. We tried 15 different plates. All so good. Service was great. Everyone was friendly. We had 2 kids with us and they went out of there way to make sure they were happy. Great find for my sisters birthday lunch. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for several years and the food is always good and the staff are always friendly. Also, really fun for a first date, or to just swing by for lunch."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!  The sushi comes around pretty quickly, so if it passes you up it won't be too long until it comes around again.  Everything seems really fresh, and has great flavor.  Every plate is $2 and worth every penny.  The service is spot on!  I would recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Even though it's a rotating sushi bar,  the sushi is fresh and the noodle bowls are amazing!  Bento lunch boxes are huge and good,  staff is wonderful especially Rose! hidden gem in chandler"}
{"text":"Eastwind Sushi took over after my beloved Sushi Eye in Motion closed.  Some of the same staff was there, however, so that was a welcome sight.  Most of the sushi is exactly what Sushi Eye offered, but now at a cheaper price.  I haven't noticed a reduction in quality, either.  The staff is friendly, the experience fun, and the variety plentiful.  Be sure to try the Eastwind roll.  Delicious!  Other favorites of mine are the Climax roll (spicy tuna with tuna on top...I love tuna!) and the ASU roll (has Jalapeno on top, so great if you like spicy).  Be sure to ask for the spicy tuna poppers, too.  You will like them. :)  My husband loves the tempura mushrooms, too.  I'm actually not completely sure what they are called... it's a tempura friend mushroom with crab.  

This is a great place to go if you want to try new dishes without ordering a whole roll.  If you like sushi, it's worth trying at least once.  For me, it's one of my favorite places and I go back as often as I'm able."}
{"text":"Love this place nice environment, great food, lots of choices and prices that can't be beat. We don't make it out as often as we used to when we lived closer, but it's worth the drive to eat here for us!"}
{"text":"Our last two visits the service has been horrible, and the Food has been warm and out for a long time. You can't read the signs because they don't face outward, so you don't get a chance to really see what you're grabbing. Big hits on a Friday night are not replenished on the belt like shrimp tempura, or fresh spring rolls.

It just feels like nobody really knows what they're doing there and just  rely on their location to be popular while the food quality has gone down.

We are sad to report we have no interest in returning after our last two visits."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Alison T's review. I was pretty disappointed with this place.

First the positives - cute place, clean, friendly service (albeit clueless), $2 plates, $1.99 Kirin pints.

$2 plates consist of 2 small pieces. I don't think it's really a good deal considering how much you need to eat to be satisfied let alone full.

Also, the food was not good. (Eek I just twinged a bit because that sounds really harsh, but it's true). The spicy dumpling soup was inedible. Way too spicy! And I'm saying this as someone who loves even the spiciest of Thai food and the like. And the flavor was gross. Tasted like unfiltered tap water. Ick. I didn't even get to the dumplings.

One roll had cream cheese in it instead of avocado, which it was supposed to have. I also had the Adkins roll, the only rice free, cucumber wrapped roll they had. It just fell apart when I picked it up. In fact, both rolls were just sloppy in execution.

The kids had teriyaki chicken and rice. Chicken smelled bad. They just ate rice and edamame.

I also feel the price point is too high for Chandler. They have their rolls priced at North Scottsdale prices. So irritating. $12 for an Adkins roll? Maybe at Sting Ray at the Biltmore!

$120 for some really mediocre food on a Sunday afternoon? Not happy about it."}
{"text":"Met my son there one night for dinner our first time at a revolving sushi bar.  Very reasonable pricing per plate and lots of choices. Pretty good sushi plus they have Kirin beer on tap and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"The sushi is always delicious and convenient! The staff are very professional and always tend to your needs! I love the fun atmosphere and how close it is to everything! I definitely recommend this sushi restaurant to anyone who loves a nice little hole in the wall that makes good food!"}
{"text":"Granted, it's only $2 a plate but the portion size matches the price and the quality is not there. The pieces of fish on top of the rolls is tiny and of fair (at best) quality. The variety on the belt is minimal. If going conveyor belt, expectations are low and this place is typical. I'd rather get two good rolls elsewhere any day. I had 8 plates for $16 and about 2 rolls worth but they would have been small rolls and barely ok. Was I full when I left? No. Did I want any more? No. Was it awful? No. Will I ever come back? No."}
{"text":"all the sushi plates were $2!! And the sushi was pretty good as well  would definitely come again"}
{"text":"Super yummy place, some plate have 2 little
Pieces of sushi others like the California roll have 4 it depends but they are only $2/ plate, I enjoy coming here the place is always clean, & I can't help but dance while I'm eating every time with the aw some music they play,I love the atmosphere. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"This must be the fourth or fifth time that I come here. I love the concept of a sushi train, when the sushi are fresh of course. It allows you to try different kind of sushi for a reasonable price. 

Eastwind Sushi & Grill is a great place to have lunch, especially if you're in a hurry and don't have time to stay at the table for too long. The sushi are very nice, my favorite is the Baked Crab! All plates are $2 which is very practical when it comes to pay, count your plates and multiply by it by $2! 

The reason why I am only giving 4 stars is because we came twice around 7:30pm and the sushi were not as fresh as they should be. Must be because it's late and they close at 9pm but when I eat sushi, the first thing that comes to mind is freshness!"}
{"text":"Food was good but way over priced,service was excellent even though there was only 6 people there and they have a conveyor belt to grab your food.Staff was nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi at a great price.  It was $2.00 a plate for the sushi so a great deal but the flavor wasn't great and the service was poor.  I doubt we ever come back."}
{"text":"Love this place, sushi is good and great customer service!"}
{"text":"This place worked out so conveniently and I had never been. Definitely met my expectations. Good sushi everything plate is $2 and the staff was super nice! I'll be back! (:"}
{"text":"Really cheap place for sushi and they were pretty delicious. Definitely will be coming back for more sushi!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this sushi place!!

It may not be the best sushi, in all the land, but it is quite good.  And there is no way you can beat, with what you get, the price they offer for it. They have a sushi conveyor belt and all the plates on it are only $2! Even if you don't want just that, they have great prices on their regular entree items.  I also got the chicken terriyaki bowl and it was heavenly.  Another amazing thing, if you like to drink, is that they have $6 Sake Bombs.  That is a deal you can not pass up nor can you get a better one anyone else.  We ended up being there for about 3 hours having a great time on a Friday night. 

Not to mention, their staff is awesome. They took care of us the entire time we were there and seemed like they were having a good time as well. They always smiled and were around quite often to make sure we didn't need anything else. The waiters, as well as the sushi chefs, were super friendly and make me wish we had sushi places like this back home.

I can't wait to come back here when I get back out to Chandler!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"This would be my third spot for sushi since I live in arizona. The review seemed worth a try. I took my niece who loves sushi. We sat on the counter in front if a conveyor belt that serve $2 dish if sushi, tempura, gyoza. Sashimi. I think for $2 it worth to try it if you don't care for what u pay for. Because to me the sushi smell fishy and I don't like that. To me this just means it's not as fresh. But if your taking a group out while on a budget. This would be a great spot. (I included some pictures of my meal)"}
{"text":"Good food, fine service.   Rolls were tasty and the sushi was indeed fresh.  Use to eating sushi closer to the water and this didn't disappoint at all."}
{"text":"$2 all sushi plates which is inexpensive so why not check it out? First and foremost, the restaurant closes at 930pm on weekdays so don't come at 9pm expecting them to make anymore rolls or request food in the kitchen. 

The individual $2 sushi plates sits on top a conveyer belt which moves alongside the bar dining area. Each plate contains various rolls of sushi (i.e., 2 piece nigiri to mini size sushi rolls (2-4 pieces) as well as plates of edamame).  They do have a full menu as well ranging from more elaborate sushi rolls to cooked items for individuals that plan to dine but do not eat raw fish. 

The service was friendly yet the lower star review is based on my prior phone call to the establishment. If I known they don't make fresh food after 9, I definitely would have not visited. The overall quality of sushi was mediocre yet 3 people for $28 is inexpensive.  I would give it a second try if I lived closer and most definitely, never come late in the evening."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. It's not clean which is a huge No-No especially for a sushi place. What should be hot food (fried food) and sushi are stacked... really?  The music plays too loud for the waitress to hear what I said."}
{"text":"Nestled on a side street of downtown chandler with parking to its rear and in front of the store if you can find it. We were in pursuit of a quick sushi spot and had the kids with us. We thought it would be fun for them to go to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant. It was actually perfect for them, each plate is a  couple pieces so they could try it without ordering a whole roll and not liking it. There was a vast selection of rolls, shrimp tempura and even dessert right there all for $2 a plate. Our favorites were the ASU roll and the spicy tuna roll. It was good sushi for the price. I wasn't impressed by the California roll and one of the tempura wrapped rolls I tried went soggy from being covered. Skip those. The music was really loud for lunch time and they actually turned it up louder after we got there. I didn't ask them to turn it down, but I'm sure they would have if I asked. The service was very friendly and the place was clean.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Loved this sushi spot. I will go to a sushi bar when I get back to LA. Deliciousioso."}
{"text":"This used to be our goto sushi  place. It used to be really good. But the last few times, it's really gone consistently down hill and picking up speed. The sushi is never cold and fresh, nor is it hot, but rather soggy and flavorless. And service? Thats a joke. We walked in, stood in the doorway for almost 5 minutes, while the lady poked around on the cash register, and the guy hid behind the potted play the and played on his phone. We had taken a break, after noticing previously how bad it had gotten. I don't think there will be another chance, as I've given plenty."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite place to go for Sushi! Great prices and super friendly service! The sushi here is really fresh, good portions and selections.  I will drive out of my way to come here!!!"}
{"text":"Eastwood sushi is a fun place to go with friends and family. The sushi is delicious and very affordable. I would also recommend sharing the Fried Ice Cream it's to die for!"}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised by the higher ratings. We didn't think it was that great. 

The staff wasn't very knowledgeable about the sushi or the menu items. Anything we asked the response we got was in a bubbly voice of \"I don't know!\" While I appreciate her friendliness and upbeat attitude I felt she should know more about the sushi and the dishes they serve. 

My boyfriend got the orange glaze chicken. It was...okay, but definitely way over priced for what you got. $8.50 for that dish and it was mostly rice and a salad with a bit of chicken. The small salad was depressing looking with the unknown orange sauce (again, the server didn't know what it was but laughed about it). My BF didn't eat it so we're still not sure what it was but it resembled thousand island.

The sushi wasn't good either. Now we do have some friends who loved their sushi which is why we tried Eastwind's but for us it truly fell short. We arrived right when they opened so all the sushi should have been prepared fresh and it definitely wasn't. The Tempura was complete mush and the tastes just seemed truly off. The flavors didn't blend and melt in your mouth at all. I did enjoy the New York Crunch Roll, I believe was the name. It was the one great roll in a line of unsatisfactory rolls. The other sushi rolls were tasteless, mushy and seemed to have been from the prior day.

Our favorite place is Seksun Sushi Go-Round on Ray, just west of Alma School. We have been there over a dozen times and we've never been disappointed. Give Seksun a try!"}
{"text":"$2 conveyor belt sushi.  Great deal and fun experience. I took my 14 year old nephew before a concert and he loved it.  Between the 2 of us we ate 19 plates but it was still a reasonable tab.  My fav was the fried shrimp with fried noodles wrapped around it.  I have never had that before.  Selection was decent.  Service was good.  And it felt like an urban rather than suburban experience."}
{"text":"Plates are decent size for only $2 on the conveyor belt, tasty but heavy on the sauce."}
{"text":"Eastwind is great. I have been to places with the $4 sushi boats that float around but this conveyer system is different. They are 2 piece sashimi or 3-4 piece rolls and ALL the plates are $2!

What a deal. You get so much more variety and there is no waiting! 

There is a crowns plaza hotel and shops across the street so there is a lot of demand for parking. Worst case scenario you park at the hotel.

Sushi was great. I had no complaints. Refilled drinks whenever they were low and they were busy. You could eat here on a 10 minute break since you don't have to wait to order."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to go to a sushi restaurant with a sushi roll conveyor belt so I was so excited to come across this place. It was really good and I love that the style of the restaurant allows you to sample several rolls without spending tons of money. I thought the restaurant set-up was so cool. My first sushi conveyor belt experience was everything I imagined it would be and more"}
{"text":"I always get quick, friendly service and I haven't tried a roll I didn't like! I love the conveyor belt and for those reviewers who say they can't see the signs on it...you can move them so you can see what you are getting. Easy fix. Also, if they don't replenish the one you want fast enough or they don't have the one you want at all the server will go to the chef and request it for you."}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed the food here, as I was in a mood to grab some sushi. I was going to actually order rolls but to my surprise everything I was wanting to order was already on the conveyor . For a person like me with 2 lil ones I like to get in & out a restaurant as quickly as possible. 
I definitely recommend this place and will visit again soon. 
Thanks to the other yelpers that recommended this place. 
I read every review but I'm one that will try a place to make my own opinion .."}
{"text":"I went to Eastwind yesterday evening with my family. The service was fine and the sushi wasn't too bad. The plates are all $2 which is a decent deal! However, many of the plates only came with 3 pieces which feels like such an awkward number to share with people. The conveyer belt moved pretty quick making the environment feel fast paced rather than relaxed. I also wish there was a little more variety, however, my favorite roll was definitely the Sedona roll. 

In comparison to Teharu in Tempe or Ahi in Gilbert, this one is probably my second favorite under Teharu. I think it's definitely worth a try and a cool experience if you've never been to a revolving sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"Good sushi for the price. You can't really complain. I mean it's 2 dollar plates. The Asu, Crunch roll and New York crunch is pretty good."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a revolving sushi bar and so I wasn't sure what to expect.  Basically there is a conveyer the goes around the bar.  The sushi was very good.  Each plate is $2 and contain 2-4 pieces of sushi.  Every time I looked up there was a different sushi option so the food is fresh.  There were even specialty rolls that would appear.  For example, I grabbed the only hot mochi plate since I had never tried it before.

My wife and I didn't dislike anything we tried.  This place is definitely worth visiting.  

Please note that $2 per plate adds up quickly.  I ended up spending about the same as a non-revolving sushi place."}
{"text":"I came here with a few people on a Wednesday night and we were the only ones there.  That being said, we got undivided service!  I believe the place just had a grand opening as well.  The service was great, they played good music and the prices were reasonable.  I tried the sedona roll, lobster roll, and chicken wings. The food was delicious and presented well."}
{"text":"Deliciousl, great prices and best off all you can try different sushi plates for only $2!! :) Try the New York Crunch here! Amazing!"}
{"text":"If there's anything you should know about me, it's that I love sushi. I particularly love revolving sushi bars because I'm scared of commitment with high price tags that can often come with some sushi rolls. Since I've moved to the Phoenix area, I've been committed to another revolving sushi bar but Eastwind has to be my new favorite. At $2 a plate, you can try a little bit of everything, including some chef specials. Not only are the plates affordable, but everything that I had was delicious! I loved that Eastwind had more of a selection than other revolving sushi bars that I have been to. Check it out if you're in the area - there's a dedicated lot next to the Eastwind building but there's street parking a little farther down if it's full. I wish I lived in the Chandler area so I could come back all the time!"}
{"text":"Lets begin.... 2.5 Stars, but since the place was very Clean and the staff was pretty good, I will give them the roundup of 3.

we tried a few of the sushi go round items, lava roll, Vegas Roll, and even tried the mushrooms.. We also got the Pad Thai, and my wife thought it was great, but I thought it had a tad bit much vinegar in it.. Not exactly what i was wanting, I am more of a Pad See ew type..

for the price,,, Great Deal, now if you have an educated sushi palate, you might want to skip this place, though the food was fresh enough, but this place wouldn't even compare to Sushi King, in asia and in Asia, Sushi King was the dumbed down fast food cheap place..,,."}
{"text":"Ok so sushi is my thing and I'm all about it. I do have a few stipulations though.
1. NO cream cheese. It doesn't belong. Do you think they have that in Japan??!!
2. I'm not really about the deep frying. I'll have it on occasion if I'm feeling like a fatty but otherwise, we came to eat something fresh yes? Yes.

That being said, rotating sushi bars are genius! Quick, cheap, and you get to pig out while trying a bunch of selections! Now I think it is important to know what to expect based on where you are going. For example, I'm not going to go to Denny's and order a t-bone then be upset when it is tough and chewy, let's call things like they are people.

But I would say this rotating sushi bar is definitely on my radar. LOTS of choices and all at $2 a piece! Now some may have complaints that the sushi may be left out too long, but let's use some common sense! Watch the chefs put the plates on the belt and take the new stuff they put out! Also, I am happy with the customer service. I did have a little snafu and they cut my bill in half, and on the request I did not hoot or holler, just politely let them know what happened and they were sure to take care of it. Oh and they put Monday Night Football on. Winning in my book.

I'm telling you.... the conveyor belt style restaurants are where it's at!"}
{"text":"Just okay. Every plate on the conveyer belt is $2 and had different variations of the CA roll. But for $2, can't expect too much. Service was good. If you want a quick sushi fix and you're not a fan of the 'ore adventurous stuff, go here."}
{"text":"For the price this place is fantastic. It all really depends on when you go. They keep odd hours so try and time your dinning experience to when they just open up. Otherwise when its close to closing time, the sushi selection dwindles. Good food good price."}
{"text":"I always sit at the bar and the $2 plates are fantastic. I used to come here regularly with my infant every other Friday. It was a great little night out for sushi on a budget. Everyone working there was very friendly. When I moved to Mesa I still made the drive out just to eat here. It would get a 5 Star from me however I knocked one star off for poor service. I have ordered takeout a few times in the past when my family came to visit. Everything was great! However, one time we ordered and suddenly our portions were cut in half from what they used to be (these were regular items we used to order) and another item I ordered wasn't made as described on the menu. The server, who I don't recall ever seeing before, and chef had nothing but arguments and excuses. My baby was in the car with his grandpa for an extended time waiting to get this resolved, so we left without getting our fair share of what we ordered. I have only been back once since then. I would not ever order take out again and I still can't bring myself to go there regularly after that incident. While I will still recommend it, I have to suggest the rotating sushi. At least you know what you're getting before you grab it."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I liked choosing any plate of sushi on a whim. When something delicious scrolled on by- I just grabbed it. What a great idea! It makes for a speedy lunch. I went here with my boss because his kids love the place. Well it just so happens that I love sushi, too! It was cool to check out a different sushi place than the usual RA or Stingray."}
{"text":"BEST rolling sushi place in the valley. I promise you that you won't be disappointed. I've been here over 10 times and each time my girlfriend and I enjoy our sushi. We have never gotten their menu food we just get sushi but each time it is on point. I went to a rolling sushi place in Tempe, will not name where, but I guarantee it is not as good as here. $2 a plate? Can't beat that. Great customer service as well. 5/5 would go any day."}
{"text":"Pretty good place if you want cheap sushi. Every plate is $2. Some may have 2 pieces, some may have 4. Since it's on the cheaper side, don't expect decked out sushi. Most of them were like California rolls topped with something. They have fried sesame balls, edamame, fried mussels and octopus, etc if you want something different. It's my first time going to a place with a revolving table. It's clean there and the people are friendly! I'll be back whenever I'm in town :-)"}
{"text":"This was good pretty cheap for really good sushi it was about $2 for each plate of sushi I would go at night has more sushi then in the day time. I like how they had conveyor belts you can grab any you like and how much you like and is super cheap for a sushi place whenever I go to a sushi place its $6 a plate. For like 4 rolls of sushi or something so you should go there as soon as possible."}
{"text":"My family's go to local sushi place. Love the speediness of the conveyor belt. $2 any plates make it a fun affordable sushi night for the family. Also dad likes the $2 Kirin drafts. Sushi could be a bit bigger...and they could put out more Ahi..but the $2 price sets your expectations accordingly. My daughter and I also liked their variation of Miso soup."}
{"text":"First revolving sushi place I've been to and against my pre-conceived notions me and gf tried it out. It was surprisingly tasty and we loved that we can sit down and try out food right away.

Some of the sauces on the rolls were really thick and I just don't like a lot of sauce from a plastic bottles on my sushi. They had some really good tempura rolls I liked though.

Their beer was $3? for a glass of Kirin which was amazing. I will definitely be back for sure."}
{"text":"the boys love sushi they were ok with this place the sushi was good. The boys concern was that they did not refill the turnaround. they have their preferences but try new stuff too. My only concern was they did not refill often enough. Oh yeah they didn't have the New York Strip. Overall the experience was good. the waiter was good too. very nice experience"}
{"text":"This is going to be my last time reviewing Eastwind. They are so hit or miss but obviously the misses are not bad enough to stop me from coming back and spending my money here repeatedly. Last week I came for an early Friday dinner and everything was delicious. For less than $11 I had five plates of sushi and left full and satisfied. I think I've come here enough that I've learned how to game the conveyor and pick the sushi that's always good for me. Personally, I don't pick anything that's been deep fried because it gets soggy as time goes by and I stay away from anything spicy. I usually love spicy tuna rolls but Arizona spicy is unlike anything I've ever tasted. Not only is it spicier, it's a different kind of spicy. It's a deeper, slow burning spicy that just doesn't sit well with my palette. Also, I think I enjoy Eastwind when I come here less often. So I'll stick to maybe every two-three weeks and I should be good. No more updating my review!"}
{"text":"After a long Sunday of doing yard work, the Girlfriend and i decided to go our for dinner and try out this new revolving sushi restaurant in downtown Chandler. Didn't really order any food, just sat up at the bar and watched as the plates of sushi rolled by. 

Each plate cost no more then 2.00 which is a great price, but the portion of sushi is small. You get 2 to 3 small cuts per plate. The restaurant wasn't busy at all but they had 30 plus plates moving on this conveyor belt?! which made me asked myself \"how fresh were the sushi\".

The Sushi it self was very delicious and jammed packed with flavor. Just took 10 plus plates to fill me up ^_^."}
{"text":"Had the soft she'll crab to start they ruined-it they threw it in deep fat frier, most of the sushi revolves around the California roll,  Not very imaginative,  I would not recommend this place for anyone looking for a guality sushi experience."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite low key hole in the walls. I've seen a lot of reviews saying that this place isn't a good deal because you only get 2,3, or 4 rolls on a plate from the revolving bar. So here's the deal guys let's do some simple math, most sushi places charge $6 to $15 per roll, the average roll has 8 pieces. Now stay with me here, so if you break it down to even 2 pieces per plate at $2 each its about the same if not cheaper then most places to get some sushi. Now if you choose a plate from the bar that has 4 pieces guess what your saving money because an 8 piece roll is about $6 most places. 

Now to the actual taste of the food, its good, fresh and I've never had anything I hated. A great perk to this place is that if you get something you don't like they won't charge you, I went with a friend today and she didn't care for the seaweed salad, they didn't charge her! All in all if you want a good place to eat some quick sushi and not pay a bunch, this is the place.

The staff is also friendly and moderately quick."}
{"text":"First time here fun place great friendly service good sushi for the price we will be back to try a bento box lunch"}
{"text":"Conveyor belt on the bar brings every kind of sushi right up to you! Most of them had covers, it would have been great if they all did. But it was nice to dabble and try all the different kinds. The staff seemed rushed at first, but they were friendly. We will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Q:  Why did the vegan start eating sushi?
A:  Just for the halibut! 

Came in today for some sushi.  We were seated by the conveyor belt, where every plate is $2.00, so we took it as a sign.  Let's just jump right into the review:

While the fish was decently fresh, almost everything came drowning in either spicy mayo and/or unagi sauce.  If they pulled back a little on the sauce, I think it would have been more enjoyable.  California Rolls also seemed to make up the majority of the rolls.  Everything served on the belt was some sort of variation of a California Roll but with the addition of spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, or shredded crab.  I think some simple nigiri would have been nice, especially since everything ended up tasting the same since they overused the unagi and spicy mayo sauce.  The cuts of the fish could have been more consistent as well.  Also, the actual rolls themselves are on the smaller end but two of us shared 11 plates fine. 

All in all, I wouldn't hesitate stopping in again but I don't think I would go out of my way to stop in.  Service was excellent, especially the lady who called everyone, \"honey,\" and the place was clean.  Not a bad place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I like my appetizer before the main roll.  I was realllly hungry, the 'music' was very annoying and really loud.  The ahi was cold and just browned on the edges, not nicely seared.  The spicy tuna hand roll was good.  Go try it and leave a review - maybe I was just too tired and hungry to see their best."}
{"text":"Average to mediocre sushi rolls. Service at revolving bar was okay, because you help yourself. Selection not bad, changed regularly as rotation allowed. Amazing how fast 2 people can stack up 11 plates.
2$ per plate, 2 to 4 pieces on each. Worth what you pay."}
{"text":"$2 sushi plates for lunch? Awesome! And it wasn't just Cali rolls - had many of my faves, like Rainbow, Dynamite, Dragon & New York! Plus edamame, tempura shrimp - even dessert! Boyfriend & I picked plates off the conveyor (cute!) & ate till we were full - and got out of there only $20 (after beverages) + tip. Attentive service, fresh tasty affordable rolls. Definitely come back when I'm on this side of town! Eastwind, can you open a central Phoenix location for hungry ASU students & gov't employees? Pretty please?? :)"}
{"text":"Actually, my mother told me about this spot. She was cracking me up with this story of one of her friends whose favorite sushi restaurant was known as the \"$2 sushi joint\" in Chandler! Hahaha...we had to check this out! Didn't even read the Yelp! reviews beforehand. Joke's on me, I loved it and have been back twice already. Probably the coolest part (everyone agrees) is the conveyor belt that whizzes the plates of sushi past your face while you decide on your selection. There was a sushi restaurant at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, right when the hotel opened up - they had the same type of conveyor system, but they called it an 'Automat'. Nonetheless, Eastwind is a cool little lunch spot, unpretentious and delicious. It may be true that they use alot of spicy mayo...good thing I think that's YUM! I liked the Arizona roll (or was it the ASU?) right amount of avacado, siracha and topped with sliced jalapeno. Nice lunch spot, and a fun time if you sit at the counter. See you there :)"}
