{"text":"I've drove by here several times, I would always see the sign \"$1.00 ceviche de pescado\".  My significant other and I decided to stop by and we ordered a michelada to drink, michelada seemed watered down. For food we had the special which was ceviche de pescado and oysters for $15.00 which was not a bad price but the food was not good. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I came by recommendation and ordered a large cockel de camar√≥n and a tostada de ceviche with fish. First off, props to the owner as he was the only one working and serving everyone and was doing the best he can to accommodate everyone in a timely manner. Anyways, the food portions were thru the roof. Lots of shrimp in the cocktail, and ceviche on the tostada. Mind you the tostadas are only #1.   Props on that!! However, the ceviche lacked a lot of flavor, no flavor if that, very disappointing. And also, the cocktail tasted very much like cucumber only. The tomatoes, celery,  etc were all cut to perfection but, all tasted like cucumber.  I think the reason for that is because he did not peel the Cucumber all the way and did not remove all the seeds...... that is recommended when preparing a cocktail/ceviche dish. ...still debating if I will return as there are lots of places to try."}
{"text":"Me and my family when to buy large ceviche and a large shrimp cocktail and it was bad no flavor at all and the shrimp wasn't even cooked all the way  I will NOT be going back sorry .."}
