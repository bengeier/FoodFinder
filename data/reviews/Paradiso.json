{"text":"My husband and I made a reservation here with Open Table.   We made the reservation about a half hour before going but it was accepted online so we figured it would work.  We arrived and the girl at the front tells us that she can't accommodate Open Table reservations on that short of notice.  We left, frustrated. Don't offer the service if you can't live up to it."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and friendly. We shared the Greek salad and chicken and penne. Both were flavourful without being overpowered by feta and spices."}
{"text":"Save your money - Worst burger I've ever eaten!!

I felt very compelled to write about the experience we had at Paradiso restaurant in Oakville.  We were seated very quickly at a nice booth but it goes downhill from there. 

I shared an order of flatbread bruschetta which was very soggy. The flatbread absorbed the liquid from the tomatoes and pesto and the bread became very mushy. There's a reason why most restaurants use crusty bread for their bruschetta.

My husband had the P.E.I. Mussels in marinara sauce and he noted that some of the mussels were cold.

Now let's get to the main event.  My husband had the sausage pizza, emphasis on sausage as he noticed that there was far too much sausage on it. The pizza was a misshaped mess of sausage, copious amounts of cilantro (enough to call it a salad) and not much cheese or sauce on the pizza. The pizza was $18 but it tasted like it was a $4 frozen pizza. And it was the only pizza on the menu. You would think that they would have your basic margarita pizza on the menu.

My son and I had the Paradiso burger with BBQ potatoes. (Maybe 5 or 6 overcooked medallions covered in a copious amount of pepper).
The burger was made with Angus beef and chorizo sausage. It also had a house made ketchup and honey Dijon mustard along with something that tasted like BBQ sauce.  

When I was deciding on my order, I had asked the waitress if the burger was spicy and she told me that it wasn't. To say that it was spicy is an understatement. My burger and potatoes were so hot that my mouth felt like it was on fire. I'm not one for spicy food, even mild wings seem hot to me. Which is why I make sure by asking ahead when ordering if it will be spicy or not.
Needless to say, I felt very sick that evening. Even my son's burger was spicy, and he had his with just the cheese and no condiments. The burgers that we received did not seem like they were worth the $19 that they charged us. 
I've had better burgers at fast food places.

I think that when a person is taking your order, they should know the menu inside and out. We also had to ask to have our water refilled.

Our experience at Paradiso last night does not even compare to previous times we dined there. It used to be such a great restaurant. My husband and I had one of our first dates at Paradiso and we remember it fondly; The restaurant is not what it used to be.

The menu is very limited (only 2 pages) and not much variety for people with less exotic tastes in food. We would definitively not go back again."}
{"text":"Overall it was good.
They don't tend to care about your folded stroller.
Service is pretty quick but a bit worrisome on the quality side, by also swing coming out almost in an eye blink.
My son didn't like the macaroni and red salsa dish, he said it is yucky, barely ate from in, and he is usually having cooked pasta by his \"nonna\" (Italian grandma).
My Italian friend wasn't impressed of the crab pasta dish, he said it is just OK. His espresso came out \"burnt\" but didn't want to complain about it..
My stomach was a bit upset after the sausage, mushrooms, olives,  sopressata salami, anchovy dish.
The few slices of some kind of speciality bread with olive oil at the beginning was something different, weird from what I've ever got in any Italian style restaurant, sorry guys.
Not really impressed, my friends... Sorry"}
{"text":"My parents lived around the corner from this place for five years and I never once went in.  I'm not sure why it took until lunch today for me to finally give it a whirl.  Both the food and service were great.

We were greeted immediately, seated in a nice booth, and the host kindly took our coats to a hidden coat room in the back.  The fresh bread they bring out at the start of the meal is delicious; moist and unlike any other bread I've seen served at a restaurant.  I wouldn't wish a gluten-allergy on anyone, but I wasn't complaining that my lunch date had to leave all the bread for me.  The only disappointment was that they were out of my first choice (pork penne), but my back-up (a pizza special) was darn tasty.  The price point is pretty typical for downtown Oakville, but the place lacked a lot  of the pretension that accompanies some of the other options.  I would go back."}
{"text":"I went to the downtown Oakville location a while ago with my husband and his friend who was visiting us from the UK. It was a late Sunday afternoon and we brought our 8 month old daughter. We were greeted very rudely and the restaurant hostess (who we think might've been the manager) did nothing to accommodate our baby.  We asked to sit in the other room away from other diners and were told there was a party coming in and couldn't sit there (there was no such party) and we had to beg said hostess for a high chair.  We felt shunned because of the baby even though she didn't make a peep the entire time we were there (patrons were coming up to us saying how well behaved she was). When it came time to selecting a restaurant to host the party after our daughter's christening in December, we quickly ruled out Paradiso and won't return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I've been to Paradiso a number of times and for a variety of reasons.  I probably go at least a dozen times a year, that's how much I like it.  It's my most recent visit this week that has me puzzled.  I was there for lunch with a friend, and we both surprised to see that the menu had changed again, but that some of our go-to dishes were still there. We also noticed that none of the regular servers who greet us by name were there either.  No matter:  We placed our order and received our fresh made Roasted Tomato Foccacia Bread.  If I was only reviewing it and the olive oil it's paired with alone, this review would be 5 stars!

Our Roasted Sweet Potato and Pumpkin Soup with spiced pumpkin seed crème fraiche arrived, and we were warned by our server that the bowls were really hot.  They were, but the soup wasn't much beyond lukewarm.  My fish burger and my friend's Basil Scented Arancini arrived shortly after we finished with the soup, and again, neither were warm - you couldn't even see steam rising off of either dish!  After a few bites, I realized that I had actually been served the chickpea burger and not the Mediterranean Fish Burger.  When I brought it to the attention of the server, instead of apologizing, he asked me if I had liked it.  Not really the point, but at least he had the decency to change the price to what I ate - a whole dollar less!  The initial error was just weird...

I don't know what has changed at Paradiso, and I will give them another try, but it wasn't up to their usual standards and service this time.  Needless to say, I won't be buying my usual gift certificates here for fear that other friends would run into a similar experience!"}
{"text":"I think I really wanted to like this place. Its set in a nice location in a very nice town but didn't impress me all that much... I started this review 10 months ago and just logged back on to my yelp account and saw I never finished....So from what I can remember it was good but there is better in the area."}
{"text":"I've been back to Paradiso a couple times of late and have been impressed. The wine list is great, servers are attentive, and management are flexible and conscientious . I've taken my wine group back a couple times and they have been very accommodating. I love the Antipasto tray yumm!"}
{"text":"As others have mentioned the olive oil is outstanding. Pluses are the location, value and friendly attentive staff. Food is pretty okay, no real \"wow\" factor but okay all the same. The burger is a lump of meat in an egg bun ...  no contrast in textures within (ie no crunch), and the spanakopita is good enough albeit uninspired. 2  1/2 / 5"}
{"text":"As the olive oil goes it gets a 5+. I'm led to believe they make it on premises,  and you can buy a bottle of it to take home.

I usually go with a large group (20+) and they are l always accommodating.  Foods is very good,  service is good and friendly. Haven't tried the whole menu,  but have enjoyed what I've eaten."}
{"text":"When I am in downtown Oakville and want to get a quick lunch. I usually drop into Paradiso.  They have great sandwiches (do not misinterpret - this is NOT a sandwich shop) and mix up the menu regularly with specials, in lauding seasonal cocktails.  I had steak a few times in the past week and a half so I opted for the braised leek quiche.  It was served as an individual round quiche instead of a slice which means more crust.... but the crust was vet nice so I didn't mind. It was served with a mixed greens salad with a balsamic vinaigrette.  Overall this really hit the spot and was light, so I was pleased.  While I kept myself contained on the food side, I ordered a cocktail; a classic....a Queen's Park Swizzle.  This was a disappointment.  Way too much lime juice. It was insanely sour.  I should have returned it, but have been here many times and the drinks have been good so I let it slide.  For a prime example - try it at Middle Branch in NYC!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place only has a 3 1/2 star rating. It is absolutely a five star.  From the moment you walk in the door to the time you leave you are made to feel welcomed and comfortable.  A few things I love about it here....

1). Coat check -  they take your coat the moment you get in and store them in their coat room for you.

2). Monday Date Night -  $60 deal for couples 

3). Food -  Quality is awesome!  

4). Mandy -  Ask for Mandy to serve your table.  She is the best there and goes the extra mile with a smile.  Paradiso; she deserves a raise!!! 

We have been here twice now and will definitely return.  The first time we came, they accidentally served our friend a non-vegetarian version of their vegetarian butternut squash ravioli.  They immediately rectified it and brought a brand new dish and comp'd her meal and dessert.  They felt really bad seeing that she broke a 20 year vegetarian lifestyle with a bite of ground sausage of all meats.  It made for a lot of great jokes the rest of the night though as you can imagine.  Moral of the story, specify that you want the vegetarian version of any dish you order just to be safe."}
{"text":"I went to Paradiso a few weeks ago and still can't get it out of my head. The bread was made fresh that day and couldn't have tasted better. The salad was delicious, even with the vegan dressing they substituted. The main course was amazing... i can't describe how flavourful everything was. My mom, who ate a non-vegan dish, was just as please. I highly recommend this restaurant. Bill came to $60 with a glass of wine but was worth much more! very impressed!"}
{"text":"The appetizer was fantastic, my husband loved his entrée but the crab ravioli was bland too much pasta and no crab.     I will try again but won't recommend that dish"}
{"text":"We came here as group of 4, I ordered Bruschetta for appetizer which I didn't like too much, only because it smells garlic extremely, but go for it if you are garlic lover. 

Then we ordered Roasted Chicken Penne, which turns out to be really yummy, specially taste of sun dried tomato in it."}
{"text":"Good service but the food is just ok. Tried the Moroccan chicken which lacked flavor. Two stars are purely for the service. Not going back because of the sub par food."}
{"text":"Excellent choice on a Saturday night and even with the Jazz fest going on the service was great. Yes it was slow but the place was packed due to the festival. Alex (?) the bartender was very good and was doing a great job with the drinks. My food arrived (crab ravioli) it was delicious with a mountain of crab on top."}
{"text":"I came for a large gathering. They had assorted antipasto which was all quite good. Very nice and attentive staff. 

For the mains, I had the crab ravioli and my wife had the braised beef short rib. We both tried each others' food, and mutually we felt the food was solid, but not much beyond that. The ravioli was supposed to have some spice in the sauce, but I didn't really catch it. It ended up being a bit too rich between the cheese in the ravioli, the cream sauce and the crab. Again, pretty good, but I felt it needed more balance. The beef was good, but nothing special either. I will say however that it had a terrific compote served with it, which would almost bring the dish up to a '4'. I'll readily admit to enjoying bolder flavors, so other may find differently.

Not really a critique, but a heads up that as a 'finer' establishment, the portions are quite small. I know that's a healthier and likely more authentic way to eat Italian, but roughly a dozen moderate-sized ravioli doesn't fill this prototypical 6'3\" North American up very well.

4 on antipasto/4.5 on service and ambiance/3 on the mains

Still, I'm open to trying again and it seems that they have a good lunch menu."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've eaten from a restaurant. My fiancé got the gnocchi with braised beef and I just got the braised beef. It was so tender and flavourful that I was scraping the plate to get the last bits left on the plate. Waitress was very friendly and everything came out quickly. Would go back in a heartbeat (probably will get the same thing!)"}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with friends for dinner and drinks. Tried the braised beef gnocchi. It was good but not great. I was expecting more flavour after 12 hours of braising. The gnocchi was well prepared. Service was outstanding and they were very accommodating to our needs.  3 stars for this particular visit but I've been before and have tried other dishes that were outstanding. Maybe I just picked the wrong dish this time."}
{"text":"The restaurant is bigger than it looks with twists and turns and different settings in each room. We were sat in a cozy corner, but it was a loud restaurant.  The calamari was delicious, with 2 different types of dipping sauces.  I had the Morroccan Chicken Supreme--the flavours were amazing.  And my hubby had Spaghettini Bolognese with veal.  He doesn't like 'funky' foods or new foods--but he enjoyed his meal. It was not very filling, which was fine.  Didn't want to be stuffed on a weekend alone with the kids. :)"}
{"text":"I may be partial since I had my first date with my fiance here and we have returned many times.

Wow...just wow!

First off: they have Hendrick's gin. As a fan of having a nice pre-meal martini and a gin drinker, I'm very happy with any place that has options beyond the 'industrial' Bombay & Tanqueray.

Appetizers we had most recently:
Seared Pork Belly
The Greek (pan fried feta, warm olives, etc)
Seared Ahi

All were incredibly tasty and I still have dreams of having them over and over.

Meals: Their steaks are awesome, but our group had:
- Burger (which includes chorizo - it was awesome)
- Moroccan Chicken (one of their standards and absolutely awesome)
- the 12 hour braised beef gnocchi (Okay, hands down one of my top 5 fave entrees here...yeah...top 5 entrees!  This place is that good)
- Spaghettini, which was good, but fairly standard sauce-wise

Dessert we had the salted caramel pecan torte thing and the olive oil cake. Both were great, but the pecan torte? *drool*

Service is always perfect: you dont' notice them until you need them, and when you need them they are courteous, VERY personable, knowledgeable, and awesome."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance.  Food was very good. The food portions are small for what they are charging. We ordered the feta salad (salty) and tuna tartare. Entré was ravioli and roasted vegetables spanakopita. Overall good but expensive dining experience The beef and pasta dishes looked better."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Excellent food. Gluten free menu and dairy free options. 
Great experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for our anniversary among many other occasions. I can't say enough good things about this place.  The food is amazing, the ambience is great, and the wine selection is wonderful!"}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant was good and reasonable for suburban standards. It is an Italian and Greek restaurant (interesting that they fused the two cultures).  

The baked brie app was delicious so I would recommend that! Also got the greek salad (fried feta and warm olives)... This was just okay.  They have an appetizer platter as well which came with soft cheese, pate, and what they called salmon proscuitto.  This platter was not worthwhile in my opinion. The salmon proscuitto is not actually a thing and just tasted like smoked salmon that had gone off. The pate comes with a thick layer of fat on top... Not for me... Had to remove all that fat first before digging into the jar for pate.

For entree, I got the chicken supreme. The flavouring was nice but it was a little dry.  I also tried the seafood risotto... This was mediocre. The risotto part was a bit disappointing.

For dessert we got the pecan tart, which was good and buttery. This came out a lot larger than expected. Almost looked like a mini pecan pie rather than a tart.

Service was good.. No qualms about the service. Staff was attentive and quick."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I am incredibly pleased every single time. The atmosphere, service, and food are all incredible!!!"}
{"text":"About as downtown Oakville as it gets. aka extremely mediocre food peddled as decent dining. How this place is always bustling is a mystery to me. It's been mediocre since I grew up in Oakville, and having been dragged here on recent trip to the GTA it's no better. Somehow I feel a large swath of the Oakville dinning crowd is afraid to drive into Mississauga to actually taste food with flavor."}
{"text":"Really great location, ambiance, service, and especially the food!
Heather looked after us tonight and made us feel right at home.
Crab cakes, calamari, and blackened cod, delicious.  We've never had a bad meal here but we usually forget to review after.  
We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place, and great downtown oakville location.  I heard the service could be lacking for large groups of 10 or more.  But its a nice spot for a date.  The food and prices are on par with most other restaurants of this type.  The interior is nice, dark and elegant.
