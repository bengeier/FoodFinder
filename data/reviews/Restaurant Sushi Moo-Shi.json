{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants I've ever eaten at.  Fresh,  great service,  small, great experience."}
{"text":"I've been there four times, half of which were average and the other half disapointing. They use lower grade algae, very plastic like feeling and taste. I will not be going back even if it's an all you can eat."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushis. Service is nice and quick. The staff are quite helpful and the overall ambience is cozy and low key. The do delivery and take out. Not too expensive either. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good all you can eat sushi. The decor is ok and the staff is nice. It is often packed so I would suggest a reservation. Bring your own wine btw."}
{"text":"My friend is a local and goes there quite often.  He's a fan. But here's the thing, there's a profitability cap on \"All you can eat anything\". Their price is about $20 for the evening menu so go figure :p  I ordered the deep fried dragon roll and it was pretty good. Mini sushi pizza was decent as well. But sadly the kamikaze roll had mushy rice and the tempura crunch was soggy as well.  The spicy salmon was also mushy in texture.   The salmon sashimi is cut in large flat slices and rolled up to look like a rose. It was decent.  I think that the overall quality of a sushi resto can be assessed by the freshness of their sashimi.    They have a few items on the order sheet that cost extra like the fried bananas, apples, ice cream desserts. Overall, it was just ok for me. I'd rather go higher end and order Ã  la carte."}
