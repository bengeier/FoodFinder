{"text":"Bubbles is a strange little cafe in the northwest that specializes in bubble teas. They also have a selection of daily specials like BBQ pork buns and soups.  My lady ordered a lychee slushie with the customary tapioca pearls, the preparation of said beverage being somewhat labour-intensive - I had ample time to browse about. Of particular interest to me was a lone rack of $2 T-shirts in the back corner - very odd. Long story short, my lady loved her lychee slushie, but alas, I could not pull the trigger on any of the tees, though I desperately wanted to, as beer promo T-shirt season is still months away."}
{"text":"First off, I should say that the service and the people behind Bubbles are great.  The man who runs the place plays great music, is really friendly, is multilingual, and brings the bubble tea straight to you!  He's super-accommodating and was very patient with our group when we took forever just to order 4 bubble teas, and changed our order multiple times.  This place, like the Vietnamese sub place just two doors down, seems to be family-run, with little kids watching TV or colouring books behind the counter.  So cute!

However, the quality of the bubble tea was a little disappointing.  I ordered cold bubble tea and it seemed kind of slushy ... like there were semisolid chunks in it, instead of being completely fluid-like with ice at the top.  The lychee jelly was OK but not anything to write home about.  Something I liked, though, was how I could suck it all up instead of having tons left over -- I'm not sure if that's because they didn't give me that much or because I've finally figured out how to drink jellied-bubble tea the right way, but yay me*!  The flavour was quite good though; it didn't taste fake, like some bubble tea places do.  Their selection is also quite strong, and the midday special means you can get small cheesecake slices (or something else, i forget just what lol) for just $1 extra.

One last thing -- I liked the cartoons on top of the lid!   They're actually cartoons that an English-speaker could read, not something in Chinese or Japanese.  I only paid $4 that day.  Yay me*!

*OK, so I like Brenda Song.  Maybe I could take her here.  And then to the Vietnamese sub place two doors down."}
{"text":"I love bubble tea and Bubbles had 2 great things about it when I went.  Firstly the guy working made me the best Taro bubble tea I have ever had, secondly it was only $4!  They have an extensive selection of flavours and about 8 choices of jelly.  I didn't wait long and they have the sealed lid machine, which I have just recently become a fan of.  My tea was not chalky at all, it was nice and creamy, the lychee jelly delicious!  They offer simple snacks and food, like sticky rice and dumplings, pork sandwiches, noodles, miso soup.  They have other smoothies, ice cream bubble tea and hot drinks.  The place is really open, they could definitely put a few more tables in here, there are only a couple places to sit.

I am so happy I found Bubbles, I plan to frequent it often.  It is definitely a place to get great bubble tea at a great price!"}
