{"text":"The only decent thing is the music. The main courses took more than half an hour to come after the appetizers. Once they came they were really terrible.  This place is in the business of ripping people off.  I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars because of the amazing entertainment on Friday nights. Such a fun crowd of regulars and wonderful singing and dancing. Food was fine, but go for the ambiance!"}
{"text":"Good Motown music playing. Nice ambiance and a good bartender. You can't ask for more on a slow holiday."}
{"text":"We were convinced by the hostess that Chez Eric had excellent mussels and a lamb shank to die for. I've had much better and the attitude of one particular bartender was horrible. We traveled to Montreal to enjoy a romantic first anniversary and ended up being insulted in French by a bartender and its staff while waiting for our 7:30 reservation at the bar. Neither one of us are fluent in French, but we understood what she was saying, including the body language."}
{"text":"This place is a sham, especially if you are an unsuspecting tourist. The ambience is good but the food is inedible. After the long wait, we left our food mostly uneaten. My \"ribeye\" was a rubbery discount cut. The chocolate cake was off a supermarket aisle. Terrible service as well. We politely highlighted to owner who basically told us to screw off. Shockingly terrible."}
{"text":"This is a tourist trap. I made the mistake of going and ordering the lobster bisque. Not only was it terrible (less of a bisque and more of a bowl of water with a hint of seafood) but it was the only thing I ordered and it came out after everyone's entrees. We had told the waitress initially that we only had an hour before a show and she said that wouldnt be a problem but it apparently was since we waited about that long for my soup. My friend's salad was just lettuce and dressing and if that wasn't bad enough, she asked if the chef could add gravy on her fries (for an extra charge) and was denied. She was told the kitchen was \"too busy to make any changes to the orders.\" We will never be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Cancelled at another place because of construction and dirty dusty street but should have gone anyways. Stopped on a whim at Chez Eric and were warmly greeted by kind and considerate staff.  Service was excellent but that is as far as I can go for compliments. The food was terrible. Poorly prepared and low quality with a watery flavorless taste to everything.  There was a live singer but she sang for only 2 minutes and then sat at a table and stayed there until we left.  We would never go back, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 10, for the owners bday special... live music, which was a hit and miss. The restaurant was packed (I'm assuming because of the event and not because of the food)... no one at the table liked their food. It was cold, tasteless and not plated well either. Don't bother!"}
{"text":"If you like karaoke, come here. If you like food, do not. We waited almost two hours for our food and when it arrived no one ate it because it tasted like a leather shoe."}
{"text":"My friends and I had an amazing time in Old Port. We were looking for a restaurant that served crème brûlée. In my naïveté, I was coerced by the host of Chez Eric, as he said they had some of the creamy and decadent dessert. Boy were we fooled. Where do I begin... As we entered the restaurant, our ears were assaulted by the tacky poor-man's Frank Sinatra. Luckily, we were mercifully seated outside in the back patio where we could barely hear him. The patio looked as if the restaurant had just opened for the summer season and had dusty seats and wobbly tables. However, the service was fine and the waiter helped fix the table. We ordered two crème brûlées: one with maple syrup and one without. When we received it, we were shook. I was personally offended by what was placed in front of my own two eyes. The crème brûlée did NOT have the crunchy hard layer of sugar that is THE STAPLE of ALL creme brûlées. Instead, it had a flaky charcoal flavor that deeply disturbed me. Inside, I did not find a creamy vanilla custard. The texture was that of runny tofu and had no flavor. I kept apologizing to my friend who had never tried crème brûlée, saying that this was not an accurate representation of what it should be. This crème brûlée was a CRIME brûlée. The best thing about this restaurant was the water.   **Disclaimer: the creme brûlée was awful but we did not have anything else from this restaurant so we cannot judge this restaurant as a whole. The guests around us seemed pleased, if that helps."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a hot summer day just after 2pm. The service was excellent, the food was not. Food was a two, service and patio a four."}
{"text":"Good location, nice venue... Go here if your taste buds have disappeared and you like MDA Xmas party music (it is shit)! Honestly I don't like leaving bad reviews but it's necessary, the food was so bland, my stake was well done on one side and med rear on the other side.... The drinks weren't good either, I know, how is that possible, the gin martini wasn't right and wine pairing was odd! The crowd was over 60, that explains the music. And bland food... Maybe? The only positive, the service was great, very nice server and barmaid!!!"}
{"text":"Luckily we missed seeing the one star reviews and stopped in. Service was fast and friendly and the food was good. It's not going to knock your socks off, but the fish and chips were quite good, and sitting outdoors on a sunny day made the meal a great experience. Truly excellent fries! Simple fare, reasonable price, perfect location."}
{"text":"Quelle belle surprise!! Tous les restaurants de la place Jacques Cartier étaient fermés alors en me dirigeant vers le marché Bonsecours je suis tombé sur ce restaurant français : Chez Eric. Un menu à moins de 40$ avec un super jarret d agneau et une tarte au citron maison ( il faut aimer le citron bien sûr ...) mais le vrai atout du restaurant : la musique et le service. Bref un bon rapport qualité/ prix et un service personnalisé. Je reviendrais avec plaisir d autant qu on peut célébrer des party sur place."}
{"text":"Fellow tourists, do yourself a favor and go to a place with better reviews because the ones before me are not lying! I'm sorry but I would not recommend this restaurant. They had a host standing outside luring people in and I can see why. The servers were friendly and polite but the food and the decor could've been much better."}
{"text":"We went after dinner for drinks and the Piano Bar. The piano player, his music, and varied taste was extraordinary. The server was extremely pleasant with great timely service. Given the service I would not hesitate to try it for dinner.  A truly fun place!"}
{"text":"I hate to give bad reviews. I really do, but trust the Yelpers- do not eat here until they change their chef/menu/ingredients. This was very bad. Like expired milk bad. I'm so sorry. The service was stupendous (hence, 2 stars), but the food is very bad. Not bland- terrible. :'( also for the money you pay.... so bad. You are better off anywhere than here, I honestly almost threw up when I tasted the soup. And I am NOT a picky eater. I think McDonalds is gourmet. I just feel terrible cuz they have people pulling in tourists from the street, the ambiance is beautiful, there's a piano bar, everything is clean and 'fancy' but the food tastes like sour milk. Don't do it! :( I wish the owners best of luck and hope they are able to change their ingredients. This place has boundless potential.  Oxoxo"}
{"text":"Very good and reasonable choice in Old Montreal PLUS live music (Pick a night when Charlotte is singing)  PLUS great combos...we had the the Osso Buco, Lobster, and Steak Frites...all good, the Lobster Bisque soup stole the show tonight however, delicious...a close second was the Tarte Tatin... A Great new find in Old Montreal..."}
{"text":"We had a very pleasant time. My escargot was very good. My salmon was very good, with a tasty, but not overpowering, dill light cream sauce. My granddaughter's Cesar Salad was good, though she didn't expect the anchovies. Her linguini Primavera was also good. Portions were quite reasonable for the price. Kaya loved her chocolate cake. My cheese cake was good, but not special. Service was good. The terrace was comfortable. If I was alone or with adults I would have stayed for live jazz vocalist. Not sure why it was not more crowded, but it was easy to talk."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant nous avait été recommandé mais nous avons été très déçus lors de notre dîner. La nourriture, à l'exception du poisson, était tout juste passable (légumes à peine cuits, riz servi froid, crème brûlée liquide) et le serveur a fait preuve d'un mépris certain à notre égard. A fuir à tout prix."}
{"text":"Beware! All this place has is ambiance. Our waiter was horribly incompetent. He must have forgotten to put our order in because we didn't get our meal for over 2 hours - at 10 pm - and that was after we inquired about it. Then he brought the wrong meal for my sister - fried fish and French fries when she ordered baked mackeral and mashed potatoes. Then he tried to say that's what she ordered and told her they were out of the mashed potatoes. The meals we did get were uninspired and poorly seasoned. Very mediocre.  The only nice thing about this place was the terrace seating.  Though it hardly makes up for the horrible food and worse service."}
