{"text":"Find another breakfast restaurant! 10:00 am on a Saturday morning and they are nearly sold out of doughnuts, No glazed, no chocolate, no sugar, no cake of any sort. You could have boston cream or some strange looking orange creation if you had to have a doughnut. Doughnuts are out so I order a bagel sandwich. Sorry, don't have bagels either! I would understand if they had big crowd this morning and got hit hard but this is common practice for this place. They are frequently out of product.  The staff is melancholy and not too concerned with getting your order right.  I can't imagine the manager here is going to last much longer."}
{"text":"Awful, just awful! The manager of this store should be ashamed for allowing such bad service! Restroom was a mess, horrible choice of product . This is a new store you expect them to be on their A game if this is as good as it gets I will not be a future customer"}
{"text":"I went to this Dunkin Donuts in Canonsburg for the third time I will not return to this one at all I live very close.  It's the people at the window.  They are clueless. .. the donuts suck they never have any donuts .  I went there today and I end up getting the wrongs donuts nothing i asked for.  I wanted  Boston cream donuts endup  with jelly filled. ..not what my kids like.... they  need to get their brains out of their  backside  and the person who's running the franchise needs to do the same the place sucks.  Its really ashame.  I will take my business to Bridgeville. Paying  too much for donuts then or given to me incorrectly."}
{"text":"I personally find the bad reviews hilarious. If you're going to Dunkin donuts for \"fresh\" donuts or magnificent macchiato, that's your first mistake. They're a chain! Have you tried local? Huntersville Bakery has homemade donuts and more. The Bagel Bin makes fresh bagels daily. I'm not into coffee so I can't help with that. You get what you come for at a CHAIN restaurant people!! The iced tea is delicious :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a regular customer here or anything but every time I do come here, I'm disappointed. The customer service is always poor. This time, I felt rushed and I had no help with any questions. Eyes were rolled and my card was snatched out of my hand and half shoved back into my hand. I'm surprised my iced coffee didn't explode when it was slammed onto the counter in front of me. I also got a sausage egg and cheese croissant which was greasy beyond belief. Like I get that it's in the category of fast food but this was ridiculous. It tasted like cleaner. I'm giving this 2 stars because my coffee ended up being delicious. I'm just overall unhappy."}
{"text":"As always Dunkin donuts has great food!!!! This particular store is very new, spacious and nice.  The wait at the store is phenomenal during peak hours.  Employees very quickly get agitated with the inability to handle large number of people.  Avoid this store during peak hours."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong - I love a good donut & I run on caffeine. I think maybe I just want this Dunkin Donuts to be good but it really has been sub par.   I don't know if it's just me or if it's DnD in general but anytime I try to order an iced coffee- be it with  a little bit of cream & sugar, or no cream & sugar and just a flavoring...it tastes like someone dropped a sugar bomb in my drink. I can't seem to get it right.  I have tried to use the DD Perks program and it seems like the employees are as clueless as I am when I try to take advantage of the \"perks\". My 2Â¢ - simplify your perks/coupons & train your employees on how to redeem/administer them.   1 star for caffeine, 1 star for the kind employee who chased me down when I drove off without my debit card."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here on Sunday the 18th of September at 6:20 PM. They had no Donuts and the two employees were rude to a customer who was in front of me. This lady simply asked if they would be making any donuts soon. The one employee said \"I said we don't have any donuts\". Now I was a little confused. I stopped to purchase a dozen donuts for my senior mother and father in law at Dunkin Donuts....they had no donuts and the servers were rude. They were supposed to be open until 10:00 PM but were they really just going to serve 2 dollar coffee drinks until then? Hopefully they don't make more than 7 dollars an hour. Whomever the owner is needs to get rid of these two. I am going to write the corporate office as my complaint seems to be the norm."}
{"text":"I'm never really a huge fan of DD but for some reason I was craving it this morning. I walked inside and was greeted by an older man at the register. He was very friendly and waited for me while I looked over the menu. I decided to get the WakeUpWrap with bacon ($1.54) and it was ready within a minute. When I got the wrap it was a lot smaller than advertised. It was however cooked for the perfect amount of time because it wasn't too hot or too cold. I'm not sure if this visit swayed my opinion one way or the other."}
{"text":"Service was excellent at this new location. Donut and coffee fresh.  Only negative....and I saw this coming before this location opened....the Parking lot is a nightmare!! It is too small for this building.  If another retail establishment opens there will be nowhere for them to park.  The enter/exit lanes are so small. You can not safely pass side by side.  Seriously, who designed this space and lot? More importantly who approved this parking and drive thru lot???"}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews. I live in Plum and come here often to get a coffee and work in the corner with my laptop. The workers are always friendly to me. The coffee is good. And normally if I splurged and get a donut, that's good too. Is it perfect? No. I'm sure they have some service hiccups but I've hardly ever experienced anything deserving of only one or two stars."}
{"text":"Stopped at this Dunkin for a quick breakfast. It's located on a divided highway therefore you have to turn at the intersection prior to or just do a turn around. This store is pretty small with about 4-5 tables so it has less of a homey, comfortable vibe. Nevertheless there was a woman reading a book.  They appeared to run an efficient drive-thru window as the orders continued to stream in. The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Service was horrible.  There was hardly anyone in the store and the cashier seemed overwhelmed by a simple question about a donut. She also managed to screw up the order.  The place was filthy on the service counters with drinks left behind.  A drive thru  employee seemed more worried about his phone. There seems to be a lack of management and no customer service.  The topping on the cake was when another patron walked up to us and told us about how many bad experiences other people at a nearby school have reported to her here. She has also had bad experiences and thought she would give them another chance but made it clear on her way out the door she's not coming back either. Steer clear if you want good service."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Let's just start off with parking. There approximately 10 spots with 2 other stores accompanying Dunkin'. But that even isn't the worst of it.  My mom sister and I have been going there since it's been opened. We can't even get what we want when asked to order it. Truly Dunkin will never see me put forth my own money toward a waste of something I don't even want. Truly despicable to put it in a sense of words. Just go to Starbucks, they won't waste your time and they will actually give you what you want."}
{"text":"I stopped here early on Saturday Morning after dropping a friend at the airport. I was surprised to find the DD retail area not open. How can pick what donuts you want at a drive through? No bagels were available...the girl tried to explain what was available at 545 AM. I picked 6...when I got home my family said they were yesterdays leftovers...greasy and tough. I expected fresh at 545 AM. I should have went to Bethel Bakery. They may have good coffee but for a Donut Shop it was sub standard. I haven't stopped at a DD for quite some time and I know I will not be back anytime soon. Too bad I can't give 0 stars."}
{"text":"The past two visits to this place went as follows:  A Saturday at 1pm: \"Sorry we are out of eggs and can't make any sandwiches\". Manager did nothing and we left.   A different Saturday at 9am:  \"Sorry we have no Munchkins\". At least this time the manager gave us 2 dozen donuts for the price of 1.   Clearly this place needs better management. Not sure if the fault lies with in-store, corporate or both but how is either of the above scenarios acceptable for a generally reliable donut chain?  Be warned if you are looking for something other than coffee."}
{"text":"Consistent delivery of great products each time I visit (3 times a week).  Coffee is spot on each time and service is quick and polite.   They handle very busy mornings well."}
{"text":"Since opening whenever I order a large iced coffee or chai tea I always say light on the ice. The person always repeats back to me... I ALWAYS get a large cup of ice with not even a filled up drink. They have officially lost my business. They never listen. Garbage franchise!"}
{"text":"I have no idea who gave this older black women named ross that waited on me a job,but They and she needs to be in another industry.  1 st  she was so rude to to this older women in front of me that I thought she was going to cry.  This pore women kept saying sorry because ross was treating her like a 2 year old. 2nd. My turn to get belittled.  I asked for 6 donuts mixed. I started with my picks but ross was not placing the one's I ordered in the box ,so I stopped.  She proceeded to let me know in the most rude way that I only selected 5. I was so taken back. I almost said I was sorry . This woman is in the wrong job."}
{"text":"I didn't notice any reason for a bad review - staff was friendly, place is still new and clean, my order was made fast and accurately (which can't be said about my normal location). Much more convenient for me since this has a drive thru."}
{"text":"I love love love Dunkin donuts it's hands down my fav coffee but I'm super disappointed with this location so far.  First time my drink order was screwed up.,, had to go back and have them fix it. Today  I asked for a iced double shot of espresso in a large cup so I could add my protein drink to it (I do this often) when it came to the window is was completely full... brought by the very curly haired girl...  I was confused and when asked the girl about it she got extremely rude and said she used a lot of ice after explaining why I order a double shot in a large glass she went to \"fix\" it making comments to the other people working  And basically dumped the ice and just gave me half the amount ( of my now watered down espresso... ) when she handed it back I was trying to ask questions for future Incase I needed to order different and she rudely said I just used too much ice...  oh yeah and then didn't give me a straw"}
{"text":"I usually don't leave reviews but this place is the worst! The people who work here are so mean. They yell at each other right in front of you and they yell into the drive through speaker if you can't hear them. I was up at the front window and I could hear the drive through person yelling, \"Can I HELP you??!!\" I turned around to see that the car was not close enough to the station because there was a long line of cars. I ordered a frozen lemonade. It tastes bad first of all, but secondly they came up to the window with a strawberry lemonade and I politely said \"i'm sorry but I think I ordered the original not the strawberry\". The guy looked at me confused and said this is a frozen lemonade. The lady who had been yelling, yelled at him to tell me to pull up front. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We had to take care of some family business in this area but we live no where near here. We stopped for a quick picker upper to get us home and the .87 Pens win coffee was piping hot and tasty. They could of stirred it a bit better for us as the sugar was all at the bottom.  The coffee served its purpose though and helped get us home safely."}
{"text":"It's a Dunkin Donuts shop like most others, so what you see is what you get. I like their dark roast coffee and it's been fresh every time I've gone there. Their hot chocolate is good too. When I take my son they put in an extra dab of milk so it's not too hot and it doesn't water it down like ice does - that's really thoughtful and makes him happy. Baked goods and breakfast sandwiches are average but consistent. Service is average. I've never had any problems.  There are not a lot of places in this area to meet up with a friend besides the bars, so I am very happy they are in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service at a Dunkin' Donuts I have ever had. Person window kept laughing and couldn't seem to hear very well (holiday party today ?) Took several tries to get order right, long wait before we got to the window, did the person in front have the same problem? My donut was hard as a rock and was very old and dry. Won't be going here again. Too bad because I drive by here several times a week."}
{"text":"Eveytime I think I'll  give it another chance, I remember why  I said  I  wouldn't  go back. I attempted to buy  1/2 dozen donuts and couldnt  because they only had 4 available ."}
{"text":"I've been to the drive-thru at this particular DD twice now and I must say it's an odd setup.  During the morning rush I feel just that -- rushed.  The menu board isn't visible until you've pulled up right next to the speaker, and even then its hard to read from your car due to it's size and placement.  I don't frequent DD that often so I don't have a tried and true order.  This most recent visit, I knew I wanted an iced coffee but was told they were out of the salted caramel syrup I wanted, apparently it was seasonal (*sad face*). No biggie.  Until the voice on the speaker chirped \"all of our flavors are listed on the board.\"   My eyes darted around, scanning top to bottom, left to right, and I couldn't find the syrup flavors for the life of me.  I laughed as I asked her for \"that chocolate one on the commercials\" and she clarified it was the fudge brownie flavor.  Sure, sounds good to me! My order included a breakfast bagel sandwich and that was pretty good, as was the coffee.  However, the drive-thru setup could use some re-configuring.  I guess at least now I know what I want to order so I won't have to tie up the line trying to make sense of the menu board."}
{"text":"This is by far the fastest and friendliest Dunkin Donuts around!! I'm always so impressed by how quickly they serve everyone and they always have a smile!! Love this Dunkin!!"}
{"text":"Just so everyone knows, I witnessed the older lady with the blonde ponytail that works in the kitchen drop my sandwich on the floor, pick it up, put it back on the cutting board and wrap it up to give it to me! I literally lost my shit as I demanded for the manager who was a dumb ass and looked at me like I was the problem. This place is ghetto, the neighborhood is ghetto and the people that work here are also ghetto. You want decent dunkin donuts go to the one on route 51."}
{"text":"My favorite one in the city. They always get my coffee right (it's just hot/iced blueberry with cream, no sugar) which doesn't seem complicated but the DD on 51 always screws it up, as do Oakland and Squirrel Hill. I only docked this one a star because they never put enough chocolate icing on their donuts. The drive-thru folks are always friendly, too!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?  Sunday morning, nine a.m. and you guys are selling STALE donuts?"}
{"text":"Haven't had a Dunkin' Donut in years, so we decided to stop in on a whim tonight. Both donuts are stale. They were to-go, and we're not driving back.   Yes, I understand it's later in the evening, but don't sell donuts if they're not going to be fresh. It will be years before we ever stop again at Dunkin' Donuts, if ever."}
{"text":"Always fast, new building, staff is cool and you can sit outside if that's you're fancy.. Baskin Robins and a drive thru."}
{"text":"Classic, but true.   This is the worst Dunkin Donuts I have ever patronized. I attempted to purchase 12 bagels this am and was denied because the had only 26(yes, I counted them) in the bins.  That's a first. Deny a customer the ability to purchase an available product for fear that they won't be able to sell the same product to another customer.    Not sure whether it's the dirty floor, the poor service and staff or the fact that I left without the fully available product that I had intended to purchase, however, I voted with my feet and left.   Thank God for Starbucks and for the Dunkin Donuts in Cranberry Township. These managers know how to run a business."}
{"text":"Dunkin Donuts??? More like ROCKIN DONUTS. There is so much hype in this day and age revolving around Krispy Kreme. Yes they have their whole hot and ready thing going for them but DUNKIN doesn't just give you a donut, it gives you an experience. Hand frosted works of art made by only the finest staff leave you itching for more each and every time. I walked into this DUNKIN Donuts and was immediately blown away by the aromas of freshly cooked dough and smiles. My cashier was such a sweet young girl named Emma who was truly passionate about her job. Before I even ordered she asked me if I was interested in purchasing a medium french vanilla iced coffee with cream and sugar; she READ MY MIND!!! That's how good they are. if I've learned anything over the years it's that there are 2 goals you should try to achieve - 1. Be the best grandma you can possibly be ( bake lots of cookies ;) ) 2. Love what you do and do what you love. Dunkin captures all of this on a daily basis, now that's something special. Roll tide ladies!"}
{"text":"This place SUCKS! Poor management!Rude staff! Nasty donuts (when they have any!) Filthy floors, tables and restrooms! Garbage can filled to the brim! No supplies on counter!DISGUSTING!!!   Always \"out \" of muffins, bagels, etc! PLUS... they want to be DUNKIN! Not Dunkin Donuts, just DUNKIN!"}
{"text":"We have tried to keep giving the location more opportunities to improve their service since they opened.    They are always out of things that we order, the staff for the most part are miserable, the orders are incorrect half the time.    Very disappointed since I generally love DD."}
{"text":"I like Dunkin.  This location is consistently mediocre. Today was the worst. Used the drive up to save time and got the usual cheery greeting asked for a dozen and the girl asked if I wanted assorted I said yes and that was the end of the conversation. Normally I am asked if I want to pick them. Went to window and was greeted by server with box in hand. Pretty sure you can't put 12 doughnuts in a box in the 10 seconds it took to pull around the corner. Paid and left had niether the the me nor patience to stay and have the order re-done, my fault. Later the box shifted and I heard hard clunks inside, not normal. Opened the box to find 2 filled doughnuts, 10 crappy hard rings with various sprinkles, none of them appeared fresh by any stretch. This location has gone steadily downhill since opening, and I gave them a break over the holidays to see if they would turn around. Nope, just getting worse."}
{"text":"Great little DD in Canonsburg Pa. always has fresh coffee, donuts, breakfast sandwiches and other things for noshing.   The coffee is always fresh and flavorful, plenty of donuts, many varieties. Lots of seats inside too.   Lots of parking as well. What else do you want to know? It's a Donut shop."}
{"text":"I LoVe to come in and get chicken salad sandwiches on croissants and carmel machiottos. Tab is always friendly and helpful.  She is also very knowledgeable about the cups when they come in and I like that because I upgrade mine often.   Xander and Janice are also very nice and helpful.  I always see them cleaning when no one is at the counter, which is almost never, and they both always have cheerful happy things to conversate about.   I do get frustrated when the employees don't have everything they need to do their job.  Or when my croissants run out or aren't made at all.  It'd be nice if things were a little more stable for both the employees and the customers."}
{"text":"This location is brand new and only a 2 minute drive from my house, so I was excited to have one that close to home.  I was going to try it when they first opened, but the line for the drive thru was about 30 cars long and down the road, and the line was out the door to go inside, so I waited a week to give them a try.    I've been to this location twice and was very disappointed both times.  I was shocked to find that the selection of donuts was terrible.  Both times I asked for a cream filled donut and a coffee (I went thru the drive-thru both times) and both times I was told that they didn't have any cream filled donuts.  Huh???  It wasn't like I was asking for some obscure, rarely found donut.  I didn't even care what the coating on the outside was...glazed, chocolate, powdered, it didn't matter.  It's the only donut I care to buy, but they didn't have any form of a cream filled donut what so ever either time. I also waited about 20 minutes in line at the drive-thru to find out that I couldn't get a simple cream filled donut.  I wasn't happy.  The 1st time I went here I was pretty forgiving because it was about 1:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday, it was the 1st week they were open so everyone that worked there was probably green and I also assumed that they probably sold out by that time of day.  I wasn't sure if they made donuts all day or not, but I ended up just getting a wrap and a drink.  The wrap was very small for the price and the drink was standard.    I decided to give them another chance 2 weeks later and this time I went there at 10AM on a Sunday.  Now at 10AM on a weekend you'd assume that they would have a full selection of donuts.  Uh, nope.  I asked for a glazed, cream filled donut and a coffee.  They said they didn't have any and then the drive-thru person preceded to try to sell me on a custard donut.  He acted like I didn't know what that was and I should try one.  I explained to them that I only want a cream filled donut, but didn't really care what the outside coating was.  Then he tried to convince me that I should get the custard or a Bavarian cream donut because they were pretty much the same thing.  After 2 minutes of back and forth with the guy, explaining to him that if it wasn't cream filled I didn't want it and him trying to sell me on every filled donut imaginable, I just ended up with a plain glazed donut.  I should have just left but I  ended up being nice and got it because I was tired of holding up the people behind me.  When I got to the window to pay I asked why they never have cream filled donuts and he said that their baker just came in and was planning on making them, hadn't got around to it yet and it would take about 20-30 minutes if I wanted to come back.  I laughed, paid and then left.    I don't think I will ever come back to this location, which sucks because it is so close to my house.  On a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the best, here's how I would rate them.  Selection - 1 Value - 1 Price - 2 Speed - 1 Employee Friendliness - 3 Staff knowledge -2 Quality - 3 Location - 5"}
{"text":"This location must be under new management because it looks like they have a whole new staff and somehow things have gotten worse than before. Still 50/50 chance your order is messed up. I didn't think it was possible but the service is now slower. Plus there's the older woman who works behind the counter that constantly coughs like she has emphysema. They're constantly out of straws and their new thing is they always forget to unlock one of the doors when they open. It's a different door every morning so it turns into a fun guessing game. I downloaded the Dunkin' app just to have as little Interaction with the staff as possible. At this point I'm willing to drive 15 minutes out of my way to go to a new location."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast with no one in line. Heard 2 employees behind the wall complaining about another employee very loudly. Brought out 'my' order finally yet not mine. Had to go back. Again very loud complaining. I was there almost 15 minutes to get a breakfast sandwich. Someone needs to hear how unhappy their employees are."}
{"text":"Nice bright, clean, open, simple Dunky-D. Ample parking with easy ins and outs the second time around the roundabouts. Spacious open patio with umbrella-ed tables and chairs for nice weather, tall windows facing south for lots of light regardless. Plenty of seating available from table to bar height either along the glass or more centrally located. The usual assortment of beverages, treats, and sandwiches are usually available throughout the day. Coffee cake muffin, 2 crullers, 9 donut seeds, and three coffees came up in short order. Fast, friendly, and competent help for our visit, it was a very good day indeed."}
{"text":"\" we don't make milkshakes after 9\" - guy working there. That alone seems fishy, also didn't have enough chocolate ice cream for one scoop. Are you serious? Is that a real policy? Cmon"}
{"text":"I love coffee and Dunkin' Donuts coffee. It is always hot and that's my number one requirement. The employees at this store are mostly all pleasant and nice. I only had one employee who seemed like he wasn't awake yet but that's ok."}
{"text":"Off to a bad start. This was my second time visiting this new location and both times I received service from the same girl. Everybody is pretty young, which I guess you'd expect...and in general everyone was kind of just standing around hanging out. This isn't really what bothered me though, because at least those who were just chilling were somewhat friendly. Now I have come to not expect much in the way of customer service these days, but there's a line and my cashier was definitely on the \"I'm getting on yelp\" side of it.   While I was standing in line the other cashier was helping a couple in front of me and I wasn't even sure my cashier was open because she was just standing there. Finally she says \"can I help you?\" No smile, completely monotone, she didn't even lift her head to look at me! I had to ask if she was even talking to me. To which she replied \"yea.\" Still no eye contact. When I asked what kind of bagels they had (wasn't wearing my glasses so I couldn't see the options), she pointed with the lamest, saddest arm I've ever seen and said \"what we have down there.\" Then when the transaction was over I couldn't even tell because she didn't say anything...not bye, not have a good day, not see you next time, not thank you...nada. No effort or any kind of desire to offer me even the bare minimum kind of service...which, like it or not, is literally your job.   I called the first time a fluke and gave this location a second chance, but without adequate customer service training for their employees I would rather not deal with the bad attitude and spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"DD automatically gets a 3 from me because I'm just personally not a fan of their coffee. Most coffee from chain shops tastes a little burnt but DD really over does it in my opinion.   Past that, I can usually tolerate it bc the people are nice and helpful and the place is clean.   Turning left in PM traffic is a little bit of a challenge."}
{"text":"For a coffee chain, I would say this Dunkin is doing just fine. My coffee order was filled accurately and efficiently, albeit at 6:30 PM.   I was greeted upon entrance, the location was clean, and I had no issues utilizing my rewards program.   I wish Dunkin in general was better coffee, but for what it is, I can't complain.   Positive notes, they had a great donut selection, even later in the day. I was impressed by that, because donuts are usually slim pickings late in the day. They also had the caloric info listed, which I liked.    For the Baskin Robbins component, I love that they post the calories right under the flavor, too. Helpful when trying to make healthier choices!"}
{"text":"When I ask for Cappuccino or macchiato  I'm not asking for half of cup of foam!!! And only 5 sips to enjoy ! They need to train these boys better I came back twice in one day hoping that maybe this time they will make it better but Nop that never happened"}
{"text":"I was traveling from Charlotte to the mountains on 77 and stopped at this Dunkin Donuts for coffee as it is not far off the highway. Two employees were on shift and no other customers were in the store when I arrived. It took a few minutes for one of the two employees to approach the cash register to take my order-which seemed to be an unnecessary wait. I ordered an iced caramel latte which is a pretty straight forward menu item. After waiting about ten minutes at the counter with an unwrapped straw in hand, the same guy that took my order asked if I was waiting on anything. He had literally taken my order and then forgotten about it moments later. He did apologize when I reiterated my order but acted as if it was the first time he had heard of my wanting a latte. It took the guy three times to make my drink. The first time, he left out the caramel. The second time, he dumped the drink out after it was made. It was on the third attempt that he was able to hand off the beverage to me. Mind you, I know about his failings due to his cursing and dropping the \"F\" bomb with every other action behind the counter.   The finished latte was pretty underwhelming. The overly abundant caramel syrup wasn't mixed well and tasted pretty artificial. The drink lacked whipped cream and caramel drizzle on top. I have worked at several Dunkin Donuts as a shift leader throughout high school and into my first year of college. This store is an embarrassment to the brand due to the general lack of service, attention and skill displayed through this interaction.  Train your employees to competently make menu items. Demand nothing less than excellent customer service. Send your employees home if they're too high to function at work."}
{"text":"Fast, clean, and yummy! This is the place we go to every Friday and get donuts. They decorate the place and the donuts whatever the holiday is. I love how there are double D handles. They are so nice and I am becoming part time owner later this week when I buy 10 shares of DNKN stock. I love this place and hopefully this location stays open forever! (I am excited to get an ice cream cake for my birthday)                                  Red's daughter, Maggie:)"}
{"text":"I usually am a fan of this location but this morning they were terrible. I came in to order a breakfast sandwich and coffee. They brought me my sandwich but never gave me my coffee. They saw me waiting here for over 5 minutes and gave everyone behind me their coffee orders but never gave me mine. Never asked what I was waiting on, nothing. I could have asked them for my order but my point is there should be someone to verify everyone's orders. With it being so busy in the mornings the staff really needs to learn how to multitask better, especially since there was one than just me asking for their orders."}
{"text":"I've tried this Dunkin' Donuts several times hoping the experience would improve, sadly it has not. My last experience involved waiting 20 minutes in the drive thru line for 2 coffees and a dozen donuts. When I got to the window they tried to give me the wrong order. In order to get the correct order I waited another 5 minutes for the two coffees. I had to remind them of the dozen donuts I ordered test again before finally getting them. Some major changes need to be made for this location to survive - they for sure need to operate like the one in Murrysville to get people in and out"}
{"text":"Every single time I come here I stand at the register waiting to be helped for 5 minutes or longer while I hear the employees in the back talking. Coming from the food service industry, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt but this has happened too many times now. Today I knocked on the wall twice and then called out for someone to help me after pacing back and forth between the register and the pick up area. It's been an empty cafe every time I come, so there's no reason for someone to not be able to greet and help customers right away."}

{"text":"I adore this Dunkin Donuts location, clean, and very big compared to other locations. They have a lot of donut and drink selections. Simply delicious and quick.  The service is always friendly and fast. They have drive-thru. New flavors of coffee all year. Love their Pumpkin Spice Latte."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would! Terrible customer service. This is the second time in a row that I've visited this location to attempt ordering an everything bagel. The first time (after standing 20 min in line with only 2 ppl ahead of me) they said they were out. Clearly there was atleast a dozen behind the counter in the tray.  No biggie, I left. Second time I go here to get the same thing, put my order in and 15 minutes later they tell me they are out of bagels??? They lady in front of me waiting, her entire order was messed up. I walked out, they are not even competent enough to provide me back my $2.50 and I didn't have another 20 min to waste while they figure it out.  I'll stick to the local bakery or Starbucks. DD must stand for dumb dipsh1ts."}
{"text":"The manager with short blonde hair, is the rudest person I've ever encountered in customer service. She should have been fired ages ago."}
{"text":"Wasn't busy when I went here. But the (for description purposes) African American woman who prepared my drink was snappy, abrupt, and lacked any sense of the value of being friendly, happy, and customer service oriented. She may be the reason I never return after this first and only visit.   After this long of being open, I'd think they'd have hashed out and gotten rid of the bad customer service either by monitoring and adjusting employee behaviors or discharging those not willing to see customer service as the top priority.   The other locations nearby have most all friendly people. This location, not so much.   Hopefully the manager or franchise owner reads reviews and makes improvements."}
{"text":"What a joke the blue shirt shift leader Kim has no respect for anyone employees customers etc I was being waited on when she said to an employee I need u to get me this order now employee said I'm with someone Kim said  get the order now  and I was just left standing there  the main manger didn't do or say anything just walked away probably to hide in office I will stop at sheetz for coffee now"}
{"text":"Nice new large store. Hard to get into with a vehicle. Easy to access if you're walking around the ships though."}
{"text":"Just like every Dunkin donuts around. New location with also a baskin robins. Nice little outdoor seating area and a drive thru."}
