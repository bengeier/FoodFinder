{"text":"If it were to be possible to give a zero star rating on yelp based on tonight you would have received one tonight if not many times before.
A ten dollar cover charge for males only on new years eve. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I had just walked a mile to get to this dump of a bar and at that point after finding out about the cover charge it wasn't a big deal. However let me explain why having a cover charge and not only a cover charge but a cover charge just for males is VERY stupid.
I do well for myself and I have money 10 bucks is NOTHING to me however being charged 10 bucks to be able to drink at your bar? You have got to be kidding me right? The first bar/club I ever went to was in London England (maybe this make me spoiled) the cover charge there fifteen pounds. At the time I was under age the girl at the door just laughed and let me in for free after looking at my passport and just said \"don't make me regret doing this\". The best club I had ever been to was in San Francisco. The cover charge that night was only 25 bucks and that was only because a WORLD KNOWN respected DJ from France was spinning that night.
Where you are located isn't Tempe and the idea of doing a ladies night especially on New Years Eve is not only stupid but you literally ought to be begging for business with very low drink specials. 
Now that I have spoken my peace on your moronic business move let us move on to service.
One of your bartenders was very polite. I ask if y'all we still serving dinner she said \"let me check\" you were and she handed me a menu. About a minute later another bartender came over and asked me as If she hated me\"do you know what you want yet?\" Keep in mind I literally had the menu for a minute at most. I replied with an \" i just got the menu I guess...\" I was cut off with \"just give me your name and i'll come back to you\" again with the same attitude. At that point I closed out and decided to leave. It wasn't worth my money and more important being here was not worth my time.
I am a local. I live in the area. I have had terrible experiences before here in the past. I continued to go here every few months when I get bored (that ended tonight) because it is walking distance and I refuse to drink and drive. The bars in Cave Creek are MUCH better and most of them charge nothing EVER. 
This bar is literally probably one of the worst bars I have ever been to in my life throughout my world travels. That says A LOT."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday night not expecting much of a crowd, but it turned out that it had a lot going on! There were people of all types and ages there; it really is a welcoming place for anybody. They also had a few different activities going on (poker, karaoke, etc.)

Pretty good food for the price! We had the chicken tenders w/fries and the caesar salad with grilled chicken. Both were pretty cheap and were a good size.

Our server was a really sweet and laid back guy. The food came out fast.

All in all, this is a fun place for a quick bite to eat with waiter service. The food is also very plentiful and good, especially for the price we paid."}
{"text":"The staff is great, love the atmosphere and the fish and chips are the best I've had since moving to AZ."}
{"text":"Excellent Food and Staff. Corned Beef and Cabbage is the bomb! A great variety of food from Soups to Burgers. It's all good."}
{"text":"Delicious food, but the worst service. My husband and I have come every couple months for the past three years for the yummy food, but every time they ignore  you (unless your at the bar) and mess up your food order. Most recently we seated ourselves, acknowledged waitress, waited 25 min for service. She took our order writing it down and charged us for upgraded sweet fries. ( we didn't receive those, or our sons food. They forgot that until after our food had been served and had never put his order in. I asked just to cancel his order since I shared my food with him and we were ready to leave, they said they already put the order in an to wait a few minutes. 25 min later and the wrong order again they had the nerve to charge us extra. I love the food and wish they would get a good team and management together."}
{"text":"Terrible service 2x's now. Place has really gone downhill. Both times had to walk over to bar to try and get served. Fight night and random people were charged a cover. Lots of upset customers."}
{"text":"The worst bar you can ever go to.  They have people there who are looking to pick fights, and the bouncers are on roids.  And quite frankly, the food sucks."}
{"text":"Good food, decent selection of booze. Professional staff! The bartenders and waitresses are gorgeous and knowledgeable of beers/food served. Tons of tv's playing all the sports and fights you could hope for. I've been going to this bar for at least a year and have never had a bad time. The owner shows up a lot and you can tell he really cares about his customers,staff and business! I would recommend this spot to anybody and everybody!"}
{"text":"Brian  kicked ass tonight,  glad he was here. he has made a great place to hang out, have good food and cocktails . thx"}
{"text":"The Hangover burger was amazing!! So flavorful and cooked perfectly. I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Better than expected. Very good bar food, excellent bangers and mash! We also had the monster cookie dessert, and it was amazing. We will deffinately go back. Only dissapointment, was the fries were nothing special."}
{"text":"Good food for a good price - the service was really good as well.   

This place is LOADED with TV's so that you can watch them from ANY angle and they were not too loud either!     The atmosphere can be a bit loud though if you wanted to have a good conversation... LOL but that is ok if you know that in advance!"}
{"text":"It ok... Food was so so. Since its in Cave Creek you can spot the snooty women that are older than the husbands.  Will try again on a Non UFC fight night."}
{"text":"I've been staying with my Dad for the last few weeks and hiding out here to do work since they have wi-fi.  The staff are always pleasant and helpful.  My Dad walks over on weekends for a Guinness and breakfast and has been equally pleased.  I've only eaten a few times but seems good for pub food faire (I'm not the best judge in this department as I'm a die hard foodie from the Bay area)."}
{"text":"I like to go to local restaurants. I don't really like national chains. If guys invest in a community I support them.  I like this place better than galleghars  which is east on Carefree hwy. nice staff.  Food is just okay. We were there on free wing day   I didn't eat. My buddy said his salad was forgettable.  Lots of tv's.  Good for sports but by the end of the evening lots of tattoos ,skanks and bad loud hip hop music.  If you want a biker bar go up to Cave Creek and go to the Hideaway 

This is really Anthem. It is a suburb. But it drags in people you would expect in south Phoenix   Wanna be bad asses. And there are always two bikes out front.  They must pull them out from a garage in back"}
{"text":"Fish fry!  I heard that Connolly's had a good fish fry so my friend and tried it tonight.  When we first walked in we were greeted nicely and shown to a table right away.  Our waitress came right away for a drink order and the drinks came quickly.  We both ordered the fish fry  and it came to the table about 10 minutes later.  So far we were really impressed with the great service and looked forward to a nice meal. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  The fried fish was the worst I have had anywhere in any state.  Whatever kind of fish they serve it's absolutely awful.  At first bite I thought maybe the fish was undercooked because it was mushy.  But no, it was thoroughly cooked but very mushy.  We ate most of the meal and when I mentioned the fish texture to our waitress she said other people had complained about the mushy texture too.  She told us the name of the fish they use but I can't remember it now.  It's definitely not cod, walleye, perch, catfish, haddock, or any fish served at other fish fries.  We will probably go back to Connolly's sometime but we'll be smart enough to never order fish again.  BEWARE OF THE FISH."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Irish bars (given my maiden name is very Irish....) and am always up to check out a new one.  I happen to be in this area which is very new to me and was excited when I saw my favorite symbol...the shamrock! I went in on Christmas Eve not knowing what to expect and boy it was busy...I guess some important games were on.  Very loud but that is my fault for not enjoying the games...no stars lost were lost for that.  I notice it is not very clean..I mean it passes a quick visual but once you are sitting there for a minute you kinda notice for the area of town it doesn't really fit. I wouldn't call this a pub or even a grill.  I call it a bar.  With bar food.  Not great.  I had a burger...so soggy it soaked through the bun.  Bleh.  I say pass on by...for the price the atmosphere and food are definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time about two years ago. Loved it. Great music, fantastic and attentive service and good food. I was a regular there once or twice a week. I do not know what happened, but they changed things. We slowly noticed that the service was not as good- slow and sometimes they forgot an order. No big deal, except it kept happening. They used to accommodate small menu changes- like veggies instead of potatoes- but it seemed to become a problem. Portion sizes became smaller. Good service is going to make or break a place. I do go in to grab a burger and fries or a shepherds pie occasionally, but last time the music was funky and louder than usual. (It was also only 4:30 so not sure why it was so loud). I am not sure with the changes in dishes and presentation and new furniture that they are promoting the sports bar, biker bar image, but they need to focus on customer service and not deviating from being a comfortable neighborhood bar that keeps its regulars happy by being appealing to all age groups."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, I'd give it 4 stars for bar fare, but my \"famous\" black and tan burger was well done when ordered medium, small handful of fries, no pickle or other extras just a burger and some fries on a plain old plate. Pretty good though for 10 bucks, and my son's corned beef sandwich had lots of meat (and more fries). Only ketchup on the table so for mustard had to trek around myself because server was way too busy.

Service: everybody including manager looked like they just got home from their day job, didn't change and rolled in to wait tables. Sloppy dress, unprofessional serving skills, an occasional drop by to see if we were OK but certainly nothing special. Atmosphere is fun & active which I liked but service is just OK. A young, uninviting and non-smiling hostess put my group of six guys next to a baseball team of 9-year-olds which according to other reviews seems par for the course.

Summary: I live in Anthem no more than ten minutes away and we have 3 or 4 places just like this right there. I don't see any reason to drive the extra miles, the place is fine as an Irish bar but nothing special."}
{"text":"Great dive place!  Next to my work stopped in for lunch.  Great service.  Nice bartender. Tasty Calamari.  Music is awesome.  Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner & a beer. I watched part of the game last night too. It's a little dark inside. There's pool tables, which is cool. Tv's everywhere with different games on. I ordered the Irish nachos, they were really good! It was my first time there, and I'd return. The bartender was nice and quick. Very attentive."}
{"text":"At Least We Didn't Get Food Poisoning!

That's about all I have to say about this experience.  We stopped here on a Friday night for a bite to eat since we were in the area.  Clearly this is a locals hangout and we are not locals!

What struck me about this place was that they're suffering from an identity crisis.  Here are a couple of examples:

1) Stripper pole on the bar!  Seriously, it's on the left hand side of the bar.

2) Go go Dancer Stage box in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by tables for diners?

3) Pool table in one corner and a DJ Booth in another.  What's going on here?

4) Nebraska Cornhuskers Signage suggests it's a Huskers Bar which is fine but what's with the Chargers stuff mixed with Cardinals?  Which one is it?

5) \"Norm\" posted up at a hightop bar table downing a large draft beer but barely able to keep from falling over.  Clearly everyone knows this guy and no one is concerned that he can barely stay upright let alone the fact that he's talking to himself most of the time. 


The food was iffy at best.  Wings were good.  I ordered the Chicken Philly Cheesesteak and I'm pretty sure they used Ground Chicken Meat.  GROSS!

We will never, ever, return to this place but I'm pretty sure they won't miss my business.  The locals have this one covered!"}
{"text":"Me and some friends decided to try a new place to watch the UFC fight.  We enjoyed Long Island Ice teas, nachos, sample platter and the chicken chimi appetizer.  We had a great attentive waitress.  Cover charge was $5, less than the previous place we went before.  Noise was not bad, plenty of TV screens.  We will defiantly be back with a few more friends for the next fight.  Oh, I forgot to mention, we were able to make reservations.   Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"This grill wasn't really for me. I went with other people who liked loud places like this, but it's not really my style. The food wasn't too bad, but the service was pretty poor. It kept taking a long time for our waiter to come back, although they were kind of busy. Still, I probably wouldn't return here."}
{"text":"On a Monday afternoon it was a ghost town. Our server was pleasant, but not outstanding. 

We had two burgers. Cooked just right & big! Loaded w/toppings. Onion rings were standard frozen bleh.

Tv's were all sports and helped the atmosphere. Overall, I would suggest this place based mostly on the burgers & tvs."}
{"text":"Came in with our biker group. Slow table service. Shared menus, waitress didn't carry an order pad, so that look longer, still."}
{"text":"Waitress was best we have had here, very nice.  Food fish and chips were good and burger good.  Fries better than usual.  The kale coleslaw was a new item for me and it was a hit.  Guinness was warmer than I am used to.  Just missed happy hour by six minutes, darn.  They did accept our entertainment electronic coupon up to 10.00.  Like all the tv's but music was to hard rock today."}
{"text":"This place had so much potential to be a great neighborhood bar. What a disappointment. It's gone from bad to worse in the past 2 years. Wanna get depressed? Go here."}
{"text":"I only go here to have some drinks and play pool. As its close to home. They have tv's for sports and such an okay area outside. Small place. Generally the bathrooms are clean. Staff pretty nice. Prices fair. I haven't ever had any food here. I believe just bar snacks ... I've been here prob 4 times in the last 5 years."}
{"text":"Waaaaay too expensive!!!! Almost thought about going to Azools for a minute. Food is reasonably priced. But liquor and beer is way too much for a dive/ biker type bar. Great lunch specials though."}
{"text":"The only positive thing to say about this bar was the Monday promotion of five free wings with any full price drink. I did not eat those wings, but others said they were Ok and also free. It only happens between 4 and 6pm, but it's not worth making a special trip because the rest of the food was poor. The famous corned beef was like eating shoe leather. It wasn't braised there or cooked there at all, it was sliced and then put on grill. Deli corned beef is usually horrible and this bar should be ashamed of themselves for touting their corned beef as famous. Two other burgers at the table received lukewarm reviews and a lemon chicken soup was missing lemon. This is a locals only place and eat at your own risk because one person (not me) was sick after dining here."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful-very friendly and attentive. The food was delicious (Shepherd's Pie and BLT w/avocado) and very reasonably priced. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great sports bar with good food and service. Nights are a little different, more of a DJ and locals scene. I would not bring my grandmother here. Drink beer and watch some football. They do that well."}
{"text":"Nice higher end b&g. No riff raff, an outdoor seating area and the female staff is very easy on the eyes!!"}
{"text":"I went to connolly's this past weekend during motorcycle ride. This biker friendly bar is a great location for a drink or a bite to eat. I ordered the buffalo chicken dip and it was good. My only complaint was the service. It was difficult to find the waitress but it looked like she was serving everyone so I expected the service to be slower. Overall this is a great bar restaurant of carefree highway."}
{"text":"Shady. . . Keep your receipts after eating here.
Luckily my friend did save his copy and it saved him from three transactions that the server put on his card."}
{"text":"Me and some friends recently went to Connolly's on a Monday night.  To our surprise, it was Karaoke night but, not the normal Karaoke ... The crowd was so much fun and the owners made us feel right at home!  The host was a blast and made all of us in the bar feel like life-long friends!  We sang and laughed all night!  The drink specials are awesome and the food was amazing!  I guess they have nightly specials so I would check it out online to see what each night offers ( www.connollysgrill.com )  We will definitely hang out there again! I've been to a lot of bars but, the owner usually isn't around and if you are not part of the normal \"click\", then you're not welcome .... NOT this bar! The owner was there and made everyone feel like family.  What a great way to do business! Good job Connolly's!!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! Been here a few times and this was the last night we'll ever go there. Husband ordered all you can fish and chips which came out with maybe 3 small pieces of fish. By the time the waitress came back much later, he re-ordered more. After waiting 20 minutes, a nasty woman with short blond hair bought over 2 tiny pieces of fish. Seriously??? I worked in the rest. business and it doesn't take 20 minutes to fry up 2 fish \"nuggets\"! And to only bring 2 fish \"nuggets\" ????  What a JOKE!!! My husband left there hungry! Your cole slaw is nasty also!! And ketchup tasted nasty. We were so pissed we paid and left.

I will give your fish tacos 2 thumbs up. I will miss those.

The 1st waitress who gave us menus and our drink had NO personality. Our actual waitress who we had before was nice. The woman who gave us the 2 fish nuggets came, dropped them on the table and walked away without saying anything. You need to find some waitresses with PERSONALITIES!

We won't be going back to this place!"}
{"text":"Wednesday night... walk thru the doors... and see a bunch of kids climbing around everything... their parents clearly not parenting their kids.  WTF??  I thought this was a biker bar? Minus 1 star.

Drinks are expensive, music is good, and some of the waitstaff look like they need to get off the drugs.  I am all about having something nice to look at while I drink my beer, but... our waitress was a fail on that one for me.  I saw some others that were nice to look at... but they were but-her-face's. (everything was nice but-her-face)

The food is pretty reasonable for a bar and grill.  Nice big piece of chicken... juicy, cooked well.  Salad wasn't wilted.

Wednesday night was apparently a card playing night... not sure what they were playing but there was a pretty good crowd playing."}
{"text":"Nice local bar.  Karaoke on Monday nights is super fun!  A nice place to go with friends for a casual drink to hang out."}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten at Connolly's as an after dinner date night drink spot before we go home. It's always been a blast, just the right amount of busy and just the right music, and a really fun way to end the night."}
{"text":"Great Sports Bar! Brian always goes out of his way to make sure we are good to go! Great people , great food, Great music! Great Bartenders and even great Bouncers! Always accommodating! All The Best Bucky/Cindy!"}
{"text":"You will never know until you walk in that this establishment is so alive. You are quickly greeted by beautiful people that take care of you with great food, drinks, and your needs. So what I'm saying is if you want to have a good time, watch your sports and eat well you should step inside. 


HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!5 stars! Owners and family are way cool."}
{"text":"My main meet up spot for me and my buddies to get together. Drinks always stay filled, food is always good and the prices are fair. The staff is always friendly and attentive. The dining room, patio and restrooms are always clean. The best bar in the area by far!"}
{"text":"Great menu with quality food.  Service was attentive and very polite.  This is a great place when you are up on the great north."}
{"text":"Great live music and great food,  lot's of buzz in the air! A fun Friday night out with my baby,  really enjoying the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in and catch a baseball game.  Ashley was my server and greeted me promptly.  She offered me the specials and was very friendly.  I asked if she could turn the Texas Rangers game on, and she said she would get that taken care of for me.  About 10 min later the manager came by to let me know they didn't have that game.  I asked if they had the baseball package and he said no they didn't.  Seems a little odd since the have all the flags of the baseball teams lining the outside of the place.  From the outside it looked like a baseball sports bar.  I stayed for a bit anyway since I already had a beer.  I ordered the Irish quesadillas and the classic Nachos.  The Irish quesadillas were different with swiss cheese and corn beef. I like all those ingredients, but it didn't come together as well as I hoped. The corn beef was avg in taste and texture. The nachos were avg at best.  Nothing special that made them stand out from other places.  The real disappointment was the beer.  It was flat and not very cold.  The atmosphere was good and the bathroom was clean.  They did have many TV's and a pretty good happy hour.  

I was really looking forward to stopping in, and finding a good Irish pub since I'm new to the area. I took a star off for the warm, flat beer and another star off for not having the baseball package. I might give it another try when football season gets here, but there looks to be much better options around town."}
{"text":"Checked around to see what sports bar had the Big 10 Network, and Connely's the only one anywhere near in N Phoenix. Looked a bit like a biker bar out front with numerous parked bikes and kind of dark inside, but lot's of TVs and low light made for good viewing. Expected country music but it was more alternative, pretty loud, but excellent selection in my opinion. Seemed like a pretty diverse crowd on a late Sunday afternoon. The service was very friendly and prompt. Not a great beer selection, but did have some craft brews on tap along with a number of Irish brews. The burgers we had were excellent and so were the sweet potato fries we had as a side. I highly recommend them. I guess you could call this an Irish pub Sports bar, but pretty hard to label. A lot of TVs and very willing to put on what you want, good food and friendly service, so no labels required."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and really wanted to like this place.  However my last visit was with 6 people and the consensus again was less than favorable.  Bar food was extremely over priced for the quality and taste. Not too mention, it took forever to get service."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Connolly's on Friday night, it was busy but service was great. My husband and I had taken a road trip to Jerome on the bike and stopped by for some sustenance, and a drink for me as I was just fender fluff on that trip! The place was packed and the vibe was energetic, we will go again."}
{"text":"Yikes! The waitress we had was SO horrible. I'm pretty sure she was high on something. It just made for awkward orders and check-ins. We pretty much kept our order easy and quick so we could enjoy ourselves and move on to the next bar. Oh well."}
{"text":"Great place to shoot some pool! Drinks are pretty cheap, foods good and the service is great. I'll have to check them out for Sunday footballllllllll!"}
{"text":"Wow what a joke! Service here is less than desired, waited way too long to order drinks and food. Food is ok,  but price is ridiculously high for what you get. Then there's the price of drinks! Double Crown and Rockstar, not even Red Bull, was $16.50!!! I might pay that in Vegas,  but a hole in the wall Irish sports bar? YGTBSM!!! Sorry,  but I'll take my money to a better sports bar with better food,  drinks and service."}
{"text":"Best Fish and Chips you will ever have~! 

We always go for UFC Fight Night and  ALWAYS have a good time. Staff is friendly, and attentive, until it gets busy. Then you disappear in the crowd. However, I have yet to have any bad service and we go about once every other week or depending on who is fighting, every Saturday night. 

It is right up the street from our house, so its a nice easy drive, and a fun place with a great atmosphere. Everyone in there gets to know each other and its Nice to go somewhere that you don't have a million bar fights, and you don't have a bunch of snooty pretentious aholes hanging out. 

Totally down-to earth and their food is really really good! I have had a lot of things off of their menu, however, my favorite are the Seared Tuna, Beef Medallions, Any of their burgers, and most absolutely my best favorite, the fish and chips. I do not know what they do different than any other place, but holy crap! AMAZING! 

They tote that they have the hottest wings you will ever taste and fortunately, this is the ONLY thing I can complain about. Their wings suck! they aren't hot. They taste like they are doused in Franks Red hot. No I don't recommend them. But they do the IRISH food and drink perfectly and let's face it, Wings AREN'T Irish. So, it doesn't hurt my feelings that their wings aren't great. 

Check it out, relax, enjoy yourself, watch a fight or two and come with your friendly attitude because everyone is cool. 

Lata all, see you there."}
{"text":"One of the best bar I've been to in a while. This my spot from now on. Great cozy place cant say enough"}
{"text":"Nice message from the manager who emailed me, inviting us back, and an apology and a promise to check my complaints about kids in the bar area. We will go again,it was nice to see an owner take a comment seriously."}
{"text":"All in all, this place is your run-of-the-mill sports bar.  TVs everywhere, tons of seats, female waitresses, and drink specials. My group went on wine Wednesday, which I highly recommend. The food is pretty good, but what really made my night, was the \"jalepeno caps.\" Del Taco used to carry these, and I would dream of them when I wasn't in the Southwest. So thanks, Connelly's."}
{"text":"Decent food, reasonable prices.  If you want to stare at a TV and not be able to hear the person sitting across the table, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Environment is OK --- although if you're going to put women in school girl outfits... at least make them semi-attractive.  I know that seems shallow but if the company is going to go the extreme of enforcing the plaid skirt with white blouse unbuttoned for cleavage show as the \"official uniform\" then please make sure it doesn't come with a spare order of muffin top or thunder thighs.

The food is pretty good but the drink specials and the beers on tap are less than mediocre.  I go here when my friends do and wouldn't go if it were up to me..."}
{"text":"Me and a coworker went there during the World Cup USA game and it was a complete mess. I worked in a bar for 8 years, and this was the worst experience ever. Waited 15 minutes for service. Waited 30 mins for food. Then another 30 minutes for the waitress to come back over and another 25 mins to pay. The TVs are too small 42\" TVs are not what anyone wants to watch the game on, and they are mounted too high. The bartender was also the waitress!!! I couldn't believe that Connellys would set her up for failure like that, she could make a lot more money working somewhere that cares about her."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  I am probably biased since I can walk there from my house, but one of my favorite neighborhood bars in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch while back,  ordered a hamburger., it was 9vercooked for my taste, 
The owner, Brian, has invited me back for another burger. I'm looking forward to it. Thanks for listening"}
{"text":"Great local hangout!!!
Excellent place to watch all sporting events.. Must do for St Paddy's day!"}
{"text":"We come here every couple weeks.  It's close to the house and has consistently decent bar food. Service can be great or just okay depending on the waitress.  They often are out of our choice of vodka, Ketel One.  Not sure why a bar that's been here awhile doesn't have the ordering down.  We usually get the fish and chips, meatloaf, or shepherd's pie.  Always good choices.  They are good about having the games on or changing to the channel you want to watch.  Not too busy on weekdays so service is quick.  The only complaints I have are that the bar area smells terribly of stale beer and the waitresses could dress better.  I understand they are going for cute and this is a sports bar but I don't really need to see so much skin."}
{"text":"we were back again on tuesday night for a little happy hour action. i was sad to see the meatballs were removed from the happy hour menu. we ordered wings and the tuesday night prime rib dinner special ($8.99) - we shared both items. the wings were saucier (without me asking!) than they were our last two visits - thanks connollys! the wings seemed smaller than our last 2 experiences though, and they were all bony on the ends .... not very appetizing looking. they tasted fine though. the prime rib was better than i expected it to be. not the fanciest cut or anything, but what do you expect for $8.99? i requested cottage cheese instead of the included potatoes, and connolly's obliged for an additional $1. no biggie. service was prompt and sweet, again. i swear they hire the nicest ladies in the area at connolly's.  i really want to give connolly's a higher rating, but the food's gotta be better for me to do it. come on connolly's, impress me!"}
{"text":"We are a fairly large office in the same parking lot as this establishment. We order lunch on the average of 2-3 days a week. Today we spent $50 on 3 orders. I ordered the mac n cheese. On their menu they state under the menu what lead us to believe that all toppings for the mac n cheese where included. Mind you the mac n cheese was almost $11 dollars. So I get back to the office and we are looking for all good toppings and it was just PLAIN mac n cheese that I could have made for 2 bucks. I called and spoke with the young lady at the bar. I asked her about my order and she stated those were \"upgrades\". I asked \" So you are charging me $10.83 for plain mac n cheese. Her response was a giggle and \"yes\". I went on to tell her about the amount of business we give them, not to mention that we refer our patients there for lunch. This will no longer happen. I will try to reframe from bad mouthing this place. But I will have to repeat this story each time someone asks us about Connolly's."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Waitress was a little slow after checking In the first time. Beer was nice big but NO COLD GLASS. My wife liked the fish & chips and said they were pretty good. This was a Thursday night so the place was not that busy. We were there about 8:00......."}
{"text":"Always a good crowd at night...like the big patio and music videos."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE ever! We used to patronize when we used to live down the street three years ago. No problem then, but after we moved, we noticed a decline. Most recently, Jan. 25, 2018. Four of us ordered different meals, no one shared because we've been there so many times, we knew what to order. Only one of us got violently ill waking up at 12:30 a.m. vomiting for hours, couldn't go to work for two days. It was determined food poisoning. They used to also have the best corned beef in the state, but it was burnt and tasted burnt. How do you burn corned beef? THUMBS DOWN and will NOT revisit ever! Please note servers have always been great, no problems ever."}
{"text":"Meh.  Extremely mediocre food.  Fine if you're looking for a pint or two but don't expect anything spectacular to come out of the kitchen - my husband and I have tried a few different menu items and have yet to be impressed.  It's not BAD, perse, just not memorable.  
Kudos to the wait staff, they're all super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar!  Staff is fantastic and the food is very good.  Did a remodel in December and honestly I was not a fan before that.  Place has upped its game!!"}
{"text":"Always super friendly. Went in there on Saturday and the game was on, they were slammed. They not only were friendly and prompt, they remembered my whole crews name's! Awesome bar."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Went there on a Sunday for football and breakfast.  Had the country fried steak which was delish. The staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Have not had a bad thing in the menu. I love the Chicken Avocado Sandwich.  Also the Irish Nachos! We will
Continue to go and enjoy getting coupons in the mail too."}
{"text":"Beer was good and cold.  The Reuben had very little meat and was sort of soggy.  Also the service was extremely slow. Didn't get water refilled until we were done with our soggy sandwiches.  But the fries were crispy as requested. I say, \"No go\" unless your just going for drinks."}
{"text":"I had a great steak sandwich here. Would like one right now, actually. Its a biker bar with games and sports, plus decent food. Lots of friend bar food but the sandwiches are pretty dang good too. Play pool, drink beer, enjoy food."}
{"text":"Connolly's is a great irish pub. It is a fun atmosphere with a lot of activities from pool to karaoke,  and special events. The wings are really good, and the menu has some really unique dishes. My personal favorite are the chicken cordeu Blue appetizers.  On Sundays during the football season, the owners are active and around, making the atmosphere personal and fun. Great job Connolly's!"}
{"text":"I, like Rebecca, want to give a higher rating, but I have been there twice and my wife didn't care for it.  Irish bar/sports bar is basically a perfect mix of what I like and I thought the food was OK.  I need to go there and just hang out to watch some games sometime.  I've had a chicken sandwich that was just OK and the Wings I had there were OK as well but again nothing special.  They do have Smithwick's on tap, which is my favorite Ale.  I'll definitely go back since I live so close to it, but hopefully next time I'll have a better report."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way home from flagstaff. The only reason i rated it 2 stars is because our waitress was great. I had a burnt French dip sandwich that was truly horrible. How do you mess up a French dip?  It was dry, burnt and way too salty. The salad was ok.  The waitress didn't charge us for the sandwich , which was very nice of her. Apparently the men's restroom was appalling.  I decided to wait rather than check out the ladies room."}
{"text":"Yo! Monday nights with Susanne should never be missed. Great vibe, wonderful service, and just an all around great time. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Meet some friends there  after the ASU vs U of A game because it was a half way point from Anthem and our house. We got there a little before 7 and was not that busy,  but we happened to get the owners/managers daughter as our server and she was so high she could not remember what we ordered half the time. Needless to say not impressed because of her."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero. These guys cannot pour a Guinness if there depended on it. An irishmen worth his salt can wait two minutes for a draft. These guy think it is a dam bud! Don't waste our time!"}
{"text":"Fun sports bar. Food is good. Pool tables, darts and other interactive video games like golf. Music and tons of tvs. Good of you are a sports fan. A place you could bring kids during the day. A couple fun drinks like the secret apple pie, yummy but dangerous."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of choices in this area, which is what I think keeps this business afloat. We've been about five times just because it was on our way home. Every time the food has been awful and the service, while kind, has been spotty bordering on absent. As a bar, it's one of only two in the area, and it's a pretty generic sports bar, so if you live nearby it is convenient. 
Bottom line: Go elsewhere if you can if you're planning to eat. Just for drinking this place is okay."}
{"text":"Nice local pub with (I counted 3 times, each count different) 17 TVs. American fare with a salute to Irish grub.
Decent beer selection. Copper mugged Moscow Mule (the wife appreciates). Unique appetizers. Really aytentive staff."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here several times, couldn't pick a better neighborhood bar! The new menu is amazing, the waitstaff make you feel like friends and family, the owners are always walking around saying \"Hi\" and really make you feel at home. Also, they always have all the games on. Preferred motorcycle parking out front, and the new remodel looks great. Honestly one of the best if not THE best place in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I've been here four times and I'm digging it!  It's so far up north that it's a nice break from the 'watch-your-rear\" Westgate thug-a-dub-dub-gangstafied crew.  If I were a gangbanger here I'd be throwing it up for the NORTHSIDE (carefree highway, baby).

Never had a real meal here but I've had plenty finger food and a few troughs of alcohol!  Finally a bar that has darts, pool tables, and yes, occassionally beer pong.  

I do have to disagree with Chris T's POV on the women in the Scottish skirts....c'mon dude it's women in skirts, bro!  Heck, I'd take a semi-hot girl serving me beerski's over a dude any day!

The outdoor seating is fun, nice televisions outside and usually a good crowd.  

It's a good mix of people.  It's a biker-friendly bar but you will find all types here and everyone seems to get along.  The only thing I don't care for is the setup of the mens bathroom.  It's set up so that when the door opens, anyone looking can see the mirror, which looks right at whoever's throwing a whiz.  

If you're up this far north, it's definatley worth getting your drink on."}
{"text":"Great bar!! Service & food are great.....fish n chips are a must try. The energy is always good. Michelle, thank you for the great service!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Great service! Irish nachos are amazing! Family friendly environment and tins of tvs for sporting events.  Best bar in North phoenix."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of Broncos fans for the AFC Championship game and they did a nice job making us all feel at home, with plenty of shout outs over the PA to get our group riled up.  Connolly's Sports Grill is a pretty comfortable sports bar with plenty of TVs.  The food was decent, but portions are a little on the small side for a sports bar.

Went with an order of the potato skins, which were very small for the price.  There were only 4 of them, but they were good.  Real bacon always helps.  Next up was a chicken philly, made with cheese wiz, like they do in Philly (although other cheeses are an option if you wish).  I thought this was one of the better chicken philly's I've had, chopped up and sautéed with onions and bell peppers, served on a nice soft roll, with the cheese wiz holding everything together nicely.

And now for the joke of the day....someone at our table ordered the fish and chips.  While nobody complained about the flavor of the fish and chips, one piece looked a little suspicious in shape.  Could it be?  Did they confuse the fish and chips order and give us....Spotted Dick?  

As soon as it arrived to the table, cameras started coming out and I knew photos of this \"codpiece\" were destined to go viral.  It was returned to the kitchen from whence it came, as no man nor woman could take a bite.  I'm sure looking at the picture, you all can understand why.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/connollys-sports-grill-phoenix#jCc8G2-5-vXaskiY3YayIQ

We finished up with a pretty good dessert of rolled cinnamon tortillas, deep fried, and topped with caramel and vanilla ice cream.  Overall if you are in the neighborhood and need a sports bar, Connolly's is a good choice."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out on a Sat night when you don't feel like being around a bunch of kids. Nice mix of customers, friendly staff.
Steak from here was surprisingly good...really good. The pours on the drinks are nice and DJ keeps a good mix of music to keep the crowd going."}
{"text":"$10 for a homemade leprechaun meatballs that were actually chicken nuggets cut in half and they added bacon and cheese you get 6 of them for $10 this place is a rip off"}
{"text":"Customer service was seriously disappointing. Took 30 mins before I had to get up myself to ask a host for a server and when we did the girl completely ignored our table. Everyone around was being helped but us. Waste of time trying to come here for a decent meal. We ended up leaving after 40 mins"}
{"text":"Best bar in BFE north Phoenix/Anthem for Sunday football.

Tons of large, HD flat screen TVs showing every game. Get there on time and you should be able to find a seat where you can see every game you want to watch.

Sunday breakfast is mediocre, but cheap. Never been to a sports bar that has good breakfast anyway...  Lunch/dinner items are a little better than your average sports bar.

Decent selection of beer.

Good service."}
{"text":"Love this bar! Very laid back feel but a place where you can still have a good time at. The owner, bartenders and bouncers are all awesome! I come here regularly with my boyfriend, not only do we enjoy the atmosphere but the bloody Mary's are delicious and so is the corn beef and cabbage which generally you can only find around St. Patty's day. I would definitely recommend this place, no doubt!"}
{"text":"Good bar food and a great place to relax and play pool.

The service in this joint is consistently awful. We are ignored and have to ask for the menu, ask for drinks ask for the check and ask for refills. I'm baffled as to why this is acceptable to the owner."}
{"text":"Solid food and friendly staff.  Tried 3 different meals so far and all were on point. Beer on tap is ice cold and mlb package rolling strong."}
{"text":"So much potential....but such bad music. Trying for the club atmosphere when clearly the demographic isn't there. Really wish we could drink some beers and listen to some good music!"}
{"text":"Food was okay... nothing to rave about.   But the service! Oh, the service.  We chose to eat in the bar table  area... the waitress was just shamefully bad.   Ignoring tables ... getting orders wrong... but she came up to the table and proclaimed \"I totally forgot about you guys \", then laughed and said that \"at least I'm honest \".  That was the last straw.   We've given you several opportunities to earn our business, and you've not taken advantage of a single one."}
{"text":"Definitely a wonderful place love the bar tenders and all the waitresses. Very fun and great environment"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last weekend. Had a pastrami sandwich and it was really great. My gf had a pulled pork sandwich and it was also great. 

The kitchen was a little slow but it was clear everything was freshly cooked so it was worth waiting a few extra minutes. There were several items on the menu I would like to try.

I also had a car bomb and a few beers. They have a decent beer selection and the pricing was fair. 

My only criticism is I didn't see a jukebox or a real dartboard. 

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The bar had a great setup.  The bartender was from the night shift and she was not as attentive as I would want.  They had two pool tables and a big outside area.  They even had WiFi was made it even better."}
