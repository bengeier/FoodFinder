{"text":"Friendly staff, awesome Food, nice ambience. The chicken platter and fried calamari is A1."}
{"text":"Great service great chicken love this place! Feeling like im going to my grandma each time!"}
{"text":"Just be sure to eat their Portugese chicken, you won't regret it. The prices are also very reasonable.  Good ambiance, nice place, will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went recently on a late diner with little sis! Place was jam packed as usual. We had to wait a little for a table. The owner was super friendly and inviting as always :) he sat us by a new spot that I haven't seen before. Sorta In the middle of the bar, nice round table! 

We ordered the fried calamari,chicken grillades plate with pasta as the side , and mix grillade ( I think it included steak , lamb, and quail )plate with pasta as well!

Total cost was 60$ I also had a gin soda :)

Food was delicious and the bread was nice and warm for once! Definitely recommend this place.

It was worth the wait. This places gets extremely busy. It sucks that they close on Sunday. You can also order to go."}
{"text":"Ce n'est plus se que c'était! Maintenant c'est plus grand, ils te servent ton poulet à la vitesse de la lumière et parfois il y a tellement de fumée dans le resto que les seul bonne place sont sur la petite terrasse! Pas facile l'hiver à Montréal ..... Mais se qui me déprime le plus c'est que maintenant le poulet ( surtout vers la fin de la soirée ) est sec et trop salée. En résumé je n'y vais plus. Je leur ai donné plusieurs seconde chances ( une dizaine ) maintenant le poulet il n'est plus bon. 
Je sais j'ai découvert le poulet grillé portugais lors d'un de mes plus beau voyage,  dans le seul autre pays ou je me voie vivre à part le Québec. Je suis donc difficile.

Pourquoi 2* : Je n'entre pas dans les détailles mais c'est trop déprimant de voir un endroit qu'on aime depuis qu'il a ouvert changer les petites choses qui font que c'était un 5* même si sont des italiens qui font de la cuisine portugaise! Leur pizza au four à bois a toujours été moyenne sans plus, le saumon trop cuit .... Il me restait le \"bitoque\" mais ça ne suffi pas. Un de mes amis m'a suggéré d'en parler au gérant! Non je vais ailleurs il y a 2 autres resto de grillades portugaise dans mon quartier. Je les laissent mourir. Je me sent trompé en fait il était gentils avec moi juste pur mon argent !!!!! Il y en a un autre super bon dans mon quartier j'ajoute le commerce et on en reparle!!! Et oui le Roi de Plateau a fermé, le Ramados a brûlé .... je commence à penser qu'il y a un complot de la mafia italienne qui veut prendre le contrôle de la business du poulet portugais à Montréal.

PS: je publie ma critique du Lauwrence  sur St.-Laurent la semaine prochaine et toutes mais critique du mois de mars ne dépasseront par + de 2*..... Fermont ces commerces indignent  qui commencent à polluer cette ville de restauration presque parfaite qu'est Montréal !!!!!"}
{"text":"Le poulet est toujours aussi bon mais il y a  beaucoup de sel!! On dirait qu'ils avaient échappé la vinaigrette au complet dans ma salade en accompagnement. J'ai demandé aux autres personnes avec qui j'étais et c'était le même constat. J'avais réservé et nous avons eu notre table pour 6 très rapidement même si c'était un samedi soir. Le gâteau tiramisu maison est super bon."}
{"text":"Someone took me to Da Lillo and introduced me to their chicken/pasta plate. You know, the one where you get half a chicken (a quarter chicken? I don't know, but it's a LOT of food) with a bunch of penne in a rose sauce. I'm normally pretty skeptical about people ordering for me, which is exactly what happened after the dreadful words \"we don't need the menu\"... but thank god it went down that way cause this plate is kind of epic. So much so that I continued eating long after I was full, and polished off the entire portion with a big satisfied orange stained grin. You know, cause of all the spicy sauce I slathered on my chicken? I lost control and finished it in a complete gluttonous trance. Delicious. Then I went back a week later and did it again.

Short term goal: try other menu items. Or not. Why mess with perfection?"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet: best pizza, pasta & grill in town! 

Looking for a quick and reasonable price eat? Come to Da lillo! The portions are generous and huge. The Portuguese chicken is absolutely exquisite, you have a choice of pasta, fries or salad. You won't go wrong with that.

Their pizza is absolutely amazing, tasty and big! Enough to share for 2 people! 

As for pasta, my favourites are : \"à la gigi & arrabiata.\"

Try their red & white sangria!! 
 
Service is a hit or miss but you're enjoying good food, the service is not mediocre but don't be too picky :)"}
{"text":"Location: Quick walk from Station Jarry métro on Rue Jarry. 

Staff: very attentive to their patrons need, constantly keeping an eye out for empty glasses or a glance for their attention.  Then were also kind enough split the 2 orders in half so my guest and I could enjoy each on our own plate. We ordered the grilled chicken w/ fries & salad (pasta was an option choice instead of salad) & The Portuguese pizza. 

Environment: while it's a fairly large dining area the tables are all rather close to each other making it very tight. A number of times I've seen waiters apologizing for slightly bumping a guest while making their rounds through the narrow spaces of the table. Nevertheless, everything was very clean and not too loud considering how close all the tables were. It was consistently busy around 8-9:30pm on a Thursday and their takeaway line was busy too. Yet food was prepared quickly & accurately. 

Food: Free bread! Their pizza menu, while a lot of different options, the variety didn't really seem like much. The pizza was good, nothing spectacular; fresh out of the fire oven and non-canned olives.  Their fries - although haven't been to MacDonald's in months - reminded me of theirs. The grilled chicken was really good. Wasn't too dry like some grilled chicken I've had elsewhere."}
{"text":"À midi.fausse trattoria italo-portugaise.convivial.clientele d'habitues.service rapide et sympathique.cuisine moyenne,le poulet,plat emblématique des portugais à montreal,semblait un peu fatigue..me souviens qu'étant plus petit cet établissement était plus intéressant côté nourriture?"}
{"text":"Endroit très bruyant, et les pizza étaient ok, je privilegierais le fait de prendre à emporter"}
{"text":"It was a holiday and cold outside and I was up on Jarry hungry with a friend and sooo happy to find this spot open. We sat in the back close as possible to the flames of the pizza oven and enjoyed the family vibe - hockey on TV, cute kids eating pasta, waiters and owners greeting a diverse stream of regulars. And then we really really enjoyed the food - we each had a freshly made pizza and loved to note the nice olives, delicious sausage and generally high quality of the ingredients used. Food came out quickly but nothing felt rushed, and the vegetarian pizza was just as good as the meat. I look forward to coming back for the grilled meats and pasta. Truly chill, amazingly tasty, wide smiles place in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The first restaurant that I went to upon arriving in Montreal. The atmosphere is great and oh yeah the food is amazing. You must try their Alla Giggi sauce with the portugese chicken. Now when I go there I dont need a menu anymore. Its a great place to hang out and enjoy great food.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been there 4 times and plan on visiting more often . Great.chicken , pizza is awesome and last night I had the veal Parmigiana which was excellent . All the great great food served by friendly people who will stop at nothing to please you ."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this weekend. I was in the mood for veal parm and shared that and a steak with an egg. The food was delicious, service was very attentive and friendly. I would recommend this place and would go back again!"}
{"text":"If your looking for some delicious charcoal Portuguese chicken, hit this spot. Everything is great here, I usually take the half chicken with a side of there rose pasta.... Honestly there pasta is phenomenal! I would have gave this a 5 star I just don't like that there closed on Sunday. Also check out here lunch menu, everything is under 13 dollars, great chicken sandwiches and they don't  skimp  on the chicken. Will take photos next time I go"}
{"text":"I've gone to Da Lillo a handful of times over the past decade.  Have to say, don't know why I don't frequent this place more than I do.  The food quality, quantity, ambiance and value for money are all OUTSTANDING. 

This restaurant is owned by 2 fellows.  One Italian (Sicilian), one Portuguese, hence the menu is a combo of both cuisines.  I started with the fried zucchini.  Excellent!  Thin, lightly battered, crispy strips of zucchini.  Then had the Lamb chops platter.  Excellently cooked (Medium - just like I asked).  4 good-sized chops (T-bone cut).  Came with excellent thin, crispy tasty fries and a fresh green salad.

Service was very professional and attentive.  Owner always around walking the floor and in the kitchen ensuring everything is running smoothly and customers are happy.

Only a couple of negatives here to note.  Firstly, the accoustics in the dining room are terrible.  Extremely loud.  Difficult to have a conversation without yelling.  However, they do have an outdoor patio facing Jarry St.  Also, all the front sliding window-doors were shut, so in better weather, when opened, would help bring down the noise level I suspect.  Secondly, no Pasteis de Nata on their dessert menu :(  So ended up having a cannolo which they correctly only fill when served, however, found the filling to be a little on the heavy side. Ricotta filling in Sicily is much lighter.

Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant.  Definitely one of the best Italian or Portuguese restaurants in North-end Montreal."}
{"text":"J'ai uniquement utilisé le service de pizza à emporter. Service très rapide et efficace.
Grand choix de pizza originale. Cependant, les prix sont un peu élevés en comparaison à d'autres, mais la qualité vaut le coup."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to stay close to Da Lillo when in Montreal.... this place is legit. I had bookmarked Da Lillo before arriving due to its location and knew I needed to give it a shot. So one night when no one felt like going out, I picked up a couple pizzas and a salad from Da Lillo and brought them back to our loft.... all of the food was fantastic! Their salad dressing was perfectly balances, the prosciutto pizza was super tasty. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been here before and i remember this place was amazing .  But this time it was just ok. Firstly the changed thier fries from fresh to frozen. Chicken was good. Pizza which i ordered was just ok. A lityle disappointed to be honest."}
