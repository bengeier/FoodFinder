{"text":"First time here but service was very friendly. Very good portion and so far one of the best chicken shawarma that I have ate in Toronto. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"I tried to find proper shawarma place for a while. I have been to several around the city, this one is truly the best one I have had. When I am in beaches area I always drop by there. Don't forget to get the chips there they are awesome."}
{"text":"I've had the chicken shawarma, the falafel, the lentil soup, and every flavour of the delicious pita chips made on site.
Everything has been tasty and served with a smile. Great staff and great food at reasonable prices. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Such a gem!! So fresh, and very friendly service. Honestly the best falafel I've had anywhere in the world. It is very sad that they are closing their doors soon! Hope that they can reincarnate in some form or another soon!"}
{"text":"We have dropped by this mid-January. We've had a platter of sort of different shawarma wraps, pita chips, pita with humus and a spin on poutine. Everything was great, very fresh and beautiful. It was just a bit spicy for me, I still loved it, don't get me wrong, but next time I'll ask to tone down the spiciness for me. 
I like how the pita is somehow both soft on the inside and crispy on the outside and I really like the bounty of colours inside the wrap.
I believe the price is fair for what you get. The ingredients are high quality and fresh, and things are properly prepared, without cutting corners. 
Humus is great too and presented nicely as well.
The free cheese comes only in a mousetrap, you cannot get quality ingredients at substandard prices. 
And the pita chips are to die for! I've tied 3 out of 4 varieties: I've skipped on the spicy one :)) 
The poutine came with very tasty meat and sause and feta cheese, it was very nice, even thou I never have fries. It was delightful break from my rules.
This place has a catering menu too!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem!  

I stop by here a little too often for their delicious chicken shawarma and falafels.   There are a few other shawarma spots in the neighbourhood, but their quality and freshness don't even come close to Arax.  Extremely friendly family-run business, which makes it even more of a delight.  Oh, need I mention their yummy homemade pita chips?"}
{"text":"First off, great staff and free pita chips while you wait! 

I saw the sign \"Best Falafel in Toronto?\" and decided to give them a shot. My friend wanted Pizza Nova across the street, but I didn't feel like overloading on carbs after a day at the beach. I got the falafel and a fattoush salad (with their signature pita chips! mmm), both of which I really enjoyed. My friend was curious as she had never tried falafels, and I was happy to give one to her as a good example of what falafels should taste like! I wouldn't call them \"the best,' I don't just throw that word around there, but I would definitely say they're \"very, very good.\" The fattoush salad was good, although I wish they had fresh mint. The guy behind the counter was sorry to say he was out, he usually brings it from his backyard, and added some dried mint - great customer service. 

All in all, very satisfying. I would come back for the service, and the cinnamon pita chips. I'd love to try more of their offerings, next time I'm at the beaches."}
{"text":"These are the best Falafels I have ever had.....the combination of flavours from all of the topping and the freshly made falafels is what dreams are made of. Seriously, go eat some."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly, they try hard, but the fact is that if this place were located in a more diverse area it would be out of business as prices are high (for the dinners) portions are small for what you pay and food quality is mediocre at best. The rice is horrible. Most residents in the area don't know any better and just get falafels anyway but for beach visitors who know better it's a disappointment
I do give them props for their pita chips which are tasty and a good item to sell in the area"}
{"text":"My friend and I tried their falafel today and we were both utterly disappointed.  It was one of the worse falafels we have ever tasted. Falafels were stale and soggy. And no flavor.  I went on the basis of the good reviews on yelp.  And I regret it.  My friend and I both got heartburn as a result from eating here.  Never again."}
{"text":"So freaking good. When I'm visiting family in the Beach, I try to go here at least 3 times before I have to leave the country again. Their pita chips are to die for, all 4 flavours-- Thyme & Sesame, Garlic, Cinnamon and Hot and Spicy-- all SO good. They have sample servings on the counter so you can just grab a taste of each one, and if you want, grab a sack of your fave flave to take out with your meal. 

Chicken Shawarma was so bomb and their red spicy sauce is serious business. I tolerate spice pretty well and hate when things are labeled spicy when they're not. This is a good spicy, one that makes your eyes well up from just a few drops of it!

To top it off, what a great area of Toronto to be in with a shawarma in your hand, parked on a bench watching the waves come in!

See you tomorrow, Arax."}
{"text":"This place has turned over several times (always falafel/shawarma for at least 20 years) but in its current incarnation as Arax it is fantastic. Great falafel and shawarma, scrumptious baklava, fab pita chips to munch while you wait, really nice people behind the counter. I've become a regular - the falafel and chicken shawarma sandwiches are excellent every single time."}
{"text":"Very friendly family business. Definite gem of the beaches! Best shawarma I've had in a long time. Fresh ingredients always and always great service. Worth the trip to the east end. Very filling and satisfying."}
{"text":"I loved this place for three years. Coming here every summer whenever the weather is nice. This place is golden, it keeps getting better and better. Good food, great prices for the portions you're getting. They allow you to add their potatoes into their shawarma now, you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Very clean and very friendly staff!  Creative and tasty overstuffed falafel sandwiches; fantastic pita chips, hummus and baba ganoush."}
{"text":"Excellent shawerma and great service. I remember eating the shawerma and it had the perfect blend of sauce, and the chicken was incredibly juicy and fresh. 

On top of that, the free chips are free. Are you kidding me, that's amazing. 

Love this place and highly recommend it. 

It's like bringing the Middle East to the Beaches."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time and have never had a bad experience. The chicken is fantastic as is the slow roasted lamb. The pita chips and hummus are some of the best I've had. The owner is delightful and works incredibly hard to make customers happy. The rest of the staff are always polite, chatty and welcoming. Love love love it."}
