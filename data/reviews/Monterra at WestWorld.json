{"text":"I was so impressed by the Monterra.  We originally worked with the old coordinator Stacia, who helped us keep within our budget.  She worked with us a great deal on the food and gave us an amazing price.  Later we worked with the new coordinator Madison, who was very helpful and very organized.  She was very prompt in everything and even let us come in earlier in the week to decorate.  Everyone loved the wedding and said the food was the best food they have ever had at a wedding.  I would highly recommend using the venue and their chef."}
{"text":"This place is supposed to cater to events and be able to handle large groups. Last night it failed miserably in this task. My group of 500 hungry people were made to stand in line for hours only to discover that they had run out of the promised food items and were serving Luke warm hots dogs. Very poor planning and execution. I would not go back under any circumstances. No stars."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times.  It's a nice facility that allows for a variety of indoor/outdoor setups.  It's pretty dynamic space.    I attended an open house a couple of weeks ago where they had all the areas of this place setup so you can see the options for hosting.  Weddings, parties, product demonstrations, fashion shows, music events, and much more...wow, I was impressed.  I like how it's located just off the 101, which makes it convenient for visitors from all over the Valley.  Next private event I host, I will have this on my list for consideration.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"We never got our money back for the food that we weren't served at the event last year. Incompetent thieves are running this place, do not book an event because you will regret it. They didn't even apologize for running out of food before serving HALF of the guests. Incredible failure."}
