{"text":"The taco itself is good. I rarely give 5 stars, but I'm glad to give them 5. 
Shortly speaking, if their taco is 10 points, then the Taco Bell is just 2.
Warning: the location shown in Yelp is not correct. For travelers, they don't accept credit cards. Make sure you bring either cash or debit card."}
{"text":"Love their tacos. They are all great. Fish or mahi mahi tacos are my favourite. If you like spice you can customize it with their hot sauce bar. I only wish they were open later on a weekday because it's hard to get there before 7pm."}
{"text":"This place pumps out the most delicious seafood tacos!!
MahiMahi yummie yummie!!
Well done to all involved THANKS"}
{"text":"Great tacos! And yes, the hot sauce is awesome and burning hot! Food order was fast and portion size was decent. Not much seating space, grab the food to go and find a nice patio near by, such as cold tea just across the street, it's pretty much prefect!"}
{"text":"I ate my heart out here. Oh my goodness, so good I am tempted to make monthly trips here just to enjoy their food. 
Had the gobernador taco, ceviche appetizer, and poke appetizer. All three were amazing!!! Well, ceviche I've had better elsewhere and between the poke and ceviche, I would def go with the poke. 
Small place - not much seating now except for a table that sits maybe five. More of a take out place."}
{"text":"The tacos were just as good as (almost) everyone here says they are.

Delicious and easygoing. The small space, long lines and almost no seats might bother some people but this is more like a take-out place anyway. Trust me, it is worth a little wait. Super yummy tacos, can't complain!"}
{"text":"Had the mahi mahi with shrimp taco on the side, with watermelon juice. Decent food!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this spot a couple months ago. Huge size portions of tacos which is a big plus for the price if you compare to the tacos you get at even more hipster joints like grand electric. Even two is hard to finish at five bucks a pop. They were out of the chorizo when I got there which was slightly disappointing since I was super excite to try it. Regardless I got some bomb shit. The classic special gobbler thing is good and the octopus is solid as well. Some weird hours and it's hard to catch them open at times would probably be my only serious complaint. People aren't lying talking good bout seven lives. I should probably be giving this five stars realistically."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp, octopus, and baja fish tacos. They were messy, saucy, and delicious - the fish taco was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside but the shrimp was our favourite. These seafood tacos are $5 each taxes in - CASH ONLY. 2 tacos per person was just the right amount. This is a tiny place with a table for 4 and 2 bars by the wall where you can stand and eat - probably fits 10-12 people comfortably. Two of us came here on a Tuesday night after work and although it wasn't overly crowded, we still had to wait a couple of minutes to stand at one of the bars. I'm sure this place is packed on the weekends. With how messy the tacos are to eat - you'll need a place to put things down and grab some extra napkins. These are the best tacos in the city!"}
{"text":"I just went to this place for the first time recently and all I have to say is that the the food was delicious! I had the famous \"Gobernador\" taco; you can't go wrong with that dish. I will definitely go back to this place again to try their other stuff. ORALE!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in the city!!!

Nothing, and I mean NOTHING compares to Seven Lives. 

I could eat their baja fish tacos everyday if I could.

Unfortunately, they are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays (WHY?!?!)"}
{"text":"When I first discovered this place it was nothing more then a small section in a store. I remember giving these tacos a try and becoming lost for words. I had ordered the carnita and the baja fish taco and had added the spicy sauce to them both. They were absolutely delicious. 

When I had returned to Kensington a few months later I realized the location had moved into a bigger spot (definitely a win) because the tacos were getting popular. The only thing that I would recommend is for there to be more seating area although I know the space is small many people do not want their tacos to go!

This is a hidden gem in the heart of Kensington market and anyone who thinks they know what good tacos are have no idea until they've been to Seven Lives."}
{"text":"Best taco I've had in Toronto. 
Don't expect to be able to get a seat and not wait in line, though. One taco is enough to make you fill.. Get the fish one."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the city ! Baja Fish tacos and watermelon juice !"}
{"text":"Mahi Mahi we try was the only food that's good there ... The rest is not very great ! Also, it's not a very clean place too"}
{"text":"Seven Lives has the best fish tacos in the city!

We came here on a Friday evening right before they closed. Between the two of us, we ordered 8 out of the 9 kinds of tacos available. They thought we were going for a record (the current record being 5 tacos, fyi) but we were just really hungry. In the future, 2 each would be more than enough.

In order from best to not-the-best (because really, all the tacos here are amazing):
1) Gobernador (smoked marlin, shrimp and cheese)
2) Blackened Mahi Mahi (grilled with a dry rub of spices) - this one comes with sour cream and guacamole-salsa-type sauce on top - very messy!
3) Baja Fish (battered and deep fried mahi mahi with cream sauce)
4) Carnitas (slow cooked pork) - we had this the day after and it still tasted great
5) Camarones Fritos (battered and deep fried shrimp with cream sauce)
6) Camarones a la Diabla (spicy shrimp with cheese)
7) Pulpo en Mole Verde (octopus with pumpkin seed mole)
8) Carne Asada (marinated steak)
The only taco we didn't try was the Mushroom and Cactus with grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Even with the almost-guaranteed lack of seats, Seven Lives' tacos are one of the few things I will willingly stand in line for.

Well worth sitting on a narrow ledge while awkwardly balancing a gobernador and a ceviche* in the middle of the park.

*Could probably eat this ceviche daily for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"first visit I had a gubernator very nice, the idea of smoked tuna was a bit strange but it works, I followed that with a spicy octopus also very good both  $5 each."}
{"text":"Good blackened Mahi Mahi taco, lots of ingredients that were delicious. Ceviche was excellent too, had guacamole."}
{"text":"I've been there for lunch a few times and loved it each time!

Food: 
The tacos are just so delicious. They have fresh juice as well - for $2! The Mahi Mahi, octopus and beef tacos were amazing :) Worth noting that the spicy sauce is really (really!) spicy!

Atmosphere:
It's a small restaurant which can probably sit 15 people at most. Always packed!

Service:
Really friendly!

Overall:
Great food and good service."}
{"text":"Have first tried their food at the Toronto Underground Market a few months ago and passed by whenever I have the time to hit up Kensington market.  I am a real sucker for their churros! Yummy"}
{"text":"This place was of course awesome.  4.5 start and one $.

Specializes in fish tacos.  Got there at 6:58pm. Only ordered the salmon and shrimp taco. ($5)  Was very good.

Three tips... They close at 7 pm as did many other places around. And they run a small short order kitchen with two grills.  So everything is made from scratch. It probably takes 10-15 minutes to make these tacos.  Lastly, since it is so good, cheap, highly rated and closes early (7pm), expect it to be crowded."}
{"text":"We decided to try the tacos at seven lives after reading all the hype on yelp. Happy to say, we were not disappointed. To start, the line was long but since we had already expected that, we patiently waited while we tried to narrow down the tacos we wanted to try. Going with the classics, we got the gobernador, the Baja fish, and the blackened mahi mahi. My favourite of the bunch was the mahi mahi... the fish was grilled to perfection, juicy and flavourful. Be careful of using the hot sauce - it is very HOT. We used the Hot sauce on the Baja fish thinking we could handle the heat, but it was a bit numbing for our taste buds, so it was hard to \"taste\" the remaining bites. Lesson learned - will stick to medium sauce next time I return!"}
{"text":"Very overrated.  I had the blackened mahi mahi taco which was very fishy tasting and not tasty at all really . The carnitas pork taco was bland and lacked flavor. The gobernator taco was okay but nothing to right home about. The daily fresh juices are nice tho. All in all, highly overrated,  overhyped, underwhelming taco place. Definitely not deserving of the high acclaim it is receiving.  La carnitas tacos are leaps and bounds better in my opinion. Not one of the tacos I had the stood out as particularly good and the blackened mahi mahi stood out as particularly bad. The juice is the highlight. Would I go back? No, not when I have had way better elsewhere. In short; okay, overrated, very hipster-y, not as good as nearby taco places."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch when I was getting my tattoo done, recommended by my artist. Best fish tacos! Had the octopus and baja taco with a side of ceviche and I couldn't finish it all. It was so good and tasty!! The octopus was the best tasting I've had. Highly recommend this place but be warned, not very much seating and there was a line up to the door when I went. All in all still worth it."}
{"text":"Currently my favourite taco joint in Toronto. Delicious and authentic taste!"}
{"text":"Holy Batman, the lines at this taqueria get out of control! But there's a reason this tiny shop (which seats like 7?) is always slammed: because they are making some mean Baja-style fish tacos. My fav is the ceviche which sits atop two deep fried tortillas and a bed of velvety, lime-spiked guac. So. Ef'n. Good."}
{"text":"Poor servvice, poor food, just all around bad experience. WHY PEOPLE GO THERE IS BEYOND ME"}
{"text":"For a $5 bill you get a taco that is fresh and delicious and feels like you are getting your money's worth. I had the fish and it was amazing. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've had the gobernator, carnitas, and octopus... The Gober is my favorite, how do they make something so tasty? I never want to go to Taco Bell again... 

The carnitas was literally STUFFED with meat, with guacamole and other stuff on top... 

10/10 I would come here again! Bring all your friends too!"}
{"text":"Currently the best taco place I have been to! You need to try their shrimp taco, the sauce is amazing. Definitely worth the visit however, keep in mind that seating is very limited (bench for 4 ppl and other standing area). $5 for a taco, best tacos in Toronto so far!"}
{"text":"A tad small (my only complaint, but hey its Kensington Market) but sooo damn tasty. Don't bother with one- YOU MUST HAVE AT LEAST TWO!  The blackened mahi mahi was incredible!  Highly recommend it.    
Note: very limited seating (around 4) and some places to stand, so either be prepared to stand and eat or savor the food experience somewhere outside - either way it will be an unforgettable. I will be back to taste the others."}
{"text":"Wowza, fish tacos in Toronto. Kensington Market seems determined to make sure I don't leave it until I'm stuffed full! I was lucky to come here on a chilly Sunday, and saw that the line didn't go out the door, like some other reviewers said. Inside, it's crazy busy with counters set up along the side, and only one table by the window with bench-style seating for 6. I love that they use a lot of live edge wood, for their counters, tables and benches - gorgeous!

The tacos are about $5 each, and there's a \"catch of the day\" option. BF and I opted to get 3 of them: the Gobernador (smoked tuna, shrimp, cheese), Baja Fish (battered + deep fried Mahi Mahi with house sauce) and the COTD, which was snapper with mango sauce. Hands down, the Gobernador was the best. That CHEESE!!!! Though all three were pretty darn good too! My only gripe was that it disappeared too fast (sad face)

The wait was only 10 minutes for us to order, and about 15 minutes for the food to get to us. Luckier still, we snagged one of the seats by the window, and blissfully downed our tacos. They have hot sauce by the counter for you to further customize your taco. The \"dine-in\" option is an open taco on a plastic basket.

Cash only! So bring plenty of it, because you'll want more than one, guaranteed!"}
{"text":"Apparently, this is the place to be for seafood tacos, so I had to check it out (along with other good eats in Kensington Market!) one Saturday evening.

My friends and I arrived just before 6 and there was a line-up to the curb. The wait to order must have been well over 30 minutes, plus another 10 minutes for the food.

I wanted to try the ceviche but it was already sold out. We ended up ordering a total of five tacos at $5 each. Each taco came as two tortillas topped with a whole lot of ingredients and sauce. A variety of salsas (mild, medium, and hot) is also provided on the side of the counter which you can add to your tacos. 

The Gobernador, filled with chunks of smoked tuna, shrimp, and cheese, was my favourite. A generous amount of seafood, cheese, and sauce made every bite simply delicious! The blackened fish (grilled mahi mahi), the spicy shrimp with cheese, and the octopus were pretty good, too. I thought the Baja fish (deep fried mahi mahi) was nothing special. Despite being crispy, there was a little too much batter, in my opinion.

Like many other establishments in the area, this taco joint is small. There is only one table, and some counter space. It was a nice evening out, so we stood outside and enjoyed our tacos by the curbside. It got pretty messy but all was well with a few forks and wet napkins available at the counter."}
{"text":"If you like tacos; this is definitely a place to visit.  There's no room too eat and the wait is long, but trust me- it's worth it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite spots in Kensington.  Their tacos are always worth the wait (which can sometimes be substantial).  Their ingredients are fresh and the combinations they put on the tortillas always work.  

Pricewise, you get a good amount of food for five dollars per taco.  As long as this place is open, I'll visit it pretty much every weekend!"}
{"text":"One of the best traditional taco places in Toronto! Be ready to wait for a while as the line starts as soon as the place opens"}
{"text":"Second time here and I'm still a big fan! Had the tuna tacos and the poke with chips which were very tasty. I could taste the burst of flavour from the tacos which probably comes from the spices and sauces used. The poke with chips came with guacamole and raw salmon which are two of my favourite things. Both paired very well with the chips that were slightly salted to give it an added boost of flavour. Though we had to stand while eating, I thought it was pretty worth it! Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Been here many times since the beginning. Yes - check it out. Only qualm - one vegetarian option. The price has gone up. Also that one big chunk of cheese hard to eat when eating tacos sometimes. 

Wish the space was bigger. But, since the tacos are so successful, I doubt they will change this. 

The hottest sauce - is HOT. So don't ruin your taco and avoid or put a tiny bit on the side so you can control it if you've never tried."}
{"text":"The best seafood tacos in the city. A little pricy at $5 a taco, but worth it."}
{"text":"The BEST tacos in Toronto. 
This place is tiny with seating for maybe 6 people at most and standing room for 4, yet it's always packed because the tacos are honestly amazing. The tortillas are warm and the perfect size for the amount of fish and toppings. I had the: Blackened Mahi Mahi and Pepper Marlin, both were delicious!"}
{"text":"I went there seven times, and not once did the the tacos ever disappointed me.

Flavourful and super filling, albeit a little too salty to have everyday. Still worth the $ even with the price increase.

Moral of the story: We need more fish tacos (not cowbells) in Toronto.

Recommendations: Baja Fish, Gobernator, Grilled Octopus, Salmon (catch of the day). The Mexican lemonade thing at the counter where you pay. The other one is the hibiscus drink."}
{"text":"I love this place, they have amazing fish tacos which explains the long line-up and packed house.  The place isn't big and it's not a sit-down-kinda place but for $5 it's the best fish taco in the city with the best value.  Get two tacos and you're good until the next meal.  

Try the spicy shrimp or blackened mahi mahi and it won't disappoint you.  Their secrets to success is the generous portions, fresh ingredients and the sauces and fresh chilies are flavourful and addictive.

if I am not giving them 5 stars it's only because i wish they had more seats in the place where I can sit down and enjoy the tacos."}
{"text":"Still my favorite fish taco joint in the city. Even with the painfully long line today, my deep fried Baja fish taco was still well worth the wait. If you can take the spice, please do try the habanero sauce. 

One thing, I do wish they use more earth friendly take out containers. With the sheer volume of customers, it is inevitable to see so many 7lives containers discarded around the area. If we can all enjoy delicious these fish tacos together in this city without adding more litter to this world, I would say we are pretty close to finding the formula for world peace."}
{"text":"My favourite taco place in the GTA.  Quality and taste is awesome! Tried it several times and they never failed to satisfy my appetite!"}
{"text":"Best ceviche ever! Only bad point is I've returned twice when they ran out and they don't have a functionl phone number to contact then to know in advance. They should atleast tweet it out so i dobt waste my time trying  to park for find out they are out of what i want. Also its Cash only."}
{"text":"45 minutes wait. 
I was intrigued by the continuous long lines. The cheesecake fed my curiosity. It's served warm and is super fluffy. Everybody who lives or visit Toronto should go, at least once."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the fried fish tacos here. The tacos are totally loaded and messy and it makes it very filling. 

Pricing is ok, as others have mentioned though, cash only!"}
{"text":"I don't eat seafood, but HAD to try the ceviche and damn, that was delicious.  I don't' think I'd try it elsewhere, but had to try it here as I kept hearing how delicious it was and the rumours were true. Wish the place was bigger as it's something I like to eat fresh, so if you don't get a seat you are out of luck. Great food, thank you!"}
{"text":"I haven't had any of their food, but I was thrilled to find Dole Whip available at their store! It was like living back to my memories of visiting Disneyland sans the crowd and the crying children. Price is good ($4 for just Dole Whip and $5 for the Dole Punch).

Try their food as well - it looked fresh from people eating around me. It's a true treat around the area...."}
{"text":"Really small store with a variety of tacos. Tried the spicy shrimp and Baja fish. Their fresh papaya juice was fresh, and the papaya meat were chopped up into little pieces. Love their hot sauce. The dressing on the shrimp was a bit too heavy/ cheesy for me, I didn't really enjoy that one. The fish was great though. I didn't really like their tortillas though. I presume it's freshly made with corn flour but it has a distinctly dry maize flavour that I don't like. For that reason I don't think I would be back any time soon."}
{"text":"I've tried every taco here and everything is excellent. You can't go wrong with the Gobernator. Their seasonal watermelon juice is awesome too."}
{"text":"The sauces they have at seven lives tacos are so good and the best! it changed my life. However, I wish they would can change their taco shells. It tasted like tasteless cardboard dough."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Tacos are very big and delicious, two are enough for a filling meal. I'm a huge fan of their mahi mahi. Their carnitas are good but I'd recommend their other items instead. The salsas are good as well."}
{"text":"No word of a lie, this taco joint is the bomb diggity. I read raving reviews on yelp and heard good things from others so I decided to check it out. I'm so glad I did.

The line up for take-out was very long but the chefs know how to get orders out fast. We had a wait time of 20 minutes after we ordered but were out of there in ten minutes. My friend and I ordered the camarones a la diabla tacos (spicy shrimp with cheese). For $5 bucks plus an extra 50cents for guacamole. The taco selection was mainly seafood but that was okay with me.

Note: there isn't much sitting area in the restaurant so take-out would be your best bet. If you're passing by, grab a taco and eat outside on a bench or something. The taco might at first look small for the money but it ends up being very filling and packed with a lot of delicious flavour. (So much that I ended up taking a nap afterwards lmao).

I can't wait to go back and eat different ones. So worth the drop-in and wait. Also a big plus, the cashier (who I assume was the owner) was very personable. Even if he wasn't, he represented the restaurant very well. 

If you haven't gone, you should. Just keep in mind that it's probably not the best place to get seats so go on a nice day so you can feast outdoors."}
{"text":"Seven Lives has opened their new location at 69 Kensington Ave.   I have to say the food was fantastic.  It took me awhile but I finally found true SoCal Mexican food.  I had the Carnitas and the battered fish tacos.  Both excellent!   My wife had the Blackened Mahi Mahi tacos and we shared the Ceviche.  It was just like what we have had in San Diego.  

The new location is great too.  It's small but people move in and out quickly if you are eating in."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite taco place in Toronto. Only negative is minimal seating and fairly long line ups, but I hear they're getting more space soon! In the mean time, I believe certain Kensington bars welcome Seven Lives patrons to eat their tacos there and grab a drink."}
{"text":"so nice. first time i had tacos in toronto that tasted like the real thing. i wish they had more places to sit. my favourite is the blackened mahi mahi. the tacos are fresh, nicely sized and have a lovely flavour. it's rare to get a soft and fragrant corn tortilla in this city."}
{"text":"This is my first time visit because my friend told me that this is a good place for taco. I bought two to share with my friend but end up having to order more. Their tacos are fantastic in terms of taste, flavour and freshness. You camnot find any other place better than that."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff working very hard. I really want to see guys like this succeed as they bring a lot to kensington. However I thought the Tacos were just mediocre and the menu left me wanting a bit more. I only had the Mahi Mahi so maybe I need to go back and try the rest to give it a fair review."}
{"text":"Fantastic baja fish taco, and it is giant! The Gobernador was good too, but not great. I  thought the shrimp was tasty but maybe I'm just not a fan of smoked fish. Will be back, and soon!"}
{"text":"The man who walked in behind us to order walked up to the counter, clapped his hands when he realized he was not too late to place an order, then did a small dance while deciding what to order.  It was like watching a toddler excitedly befriend a small animal.

My excitement wasn't quite that high, but a solid choice.

Fish tacos were good - the fried fish was a bit overcooked and therefore  a bit tougher than I'd like, but good flavor, especially the sauce.  Ceviche was good.  The veggie taco was the weakest link - but it's my own fault for picking the lone veggie option in a menu of seafood items."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place in the summer time after walking around Kensington. The huge lineup outside was worth it. They don't have much on their menu, but what they have, they do it well. Cheap and yummy food, come prepared with cash, as it's cash-only if I remember correctly."}
{"text":"Yummy food and drinks in a cool neighbourhood.

I've been to Seven Lives a handful of times and each time I leave feeling really satisfied. I've tried most the the tacos ($5 each) and recommend the Baja fish, which is fried and served with a cream sauce on top. The juices ($2 each) made in house are also really great - not too sweet or watery. The ceviche ($7) - lime marinated fish served with tortilla chips,  is also worth mentioning, although it was a little messy to eat. Overall, everything tastes really fresh and it's filling too! I usually get two tacos and share the ceviche with someone else. 

The only negative comment I have about the restaurant is the wait. Even during the weekdays for lunch the line can be pretty long (~30 min wait).

Also, note that the restaurant has very limited seating (~10 seats) and is closed Mondays and Tuesdays."}
{"text":"The taco was pretty good, but not amazingly good, and personally I find $5 for a taco is a little over priced. Seating is very limited but it's good for take out!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The Ceviche Tostada and Baja Fish Taco (battered mahi mahi) are my favourite but they are famous for their Gobernado Taco (smoked marlin & shrimp).  Becareful of their habanero sauce it is super spicy.

Lines are crazy long but it is so worth it."}
{"text":"Do not go here hungry. You will likely need to wait at least 30 minutes to get your taco fix and they are not filling. If rating just on taste however, they deserve five stars but considering the whole experience, I needed to take one star away."}
{"text":"This place has good food! And you seriously only need a few tacos to fill u up. I got greedy and ordered 3. I almost didn't finish the last one. 

There is definitely a line at that place always, but that is to be expected at a good restaurant. Their purple drink (hisbiscus drink) was not sweet enough for my taste. Other than that, everything was great"}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego so trust me when I say the freshness, quality and flavors are on point. Literally had a foodgasm while eating the gobernador and Baja fish ones. Soooo amazing. Maybe add lime to the fish but otherwise they come perfect, no additional sauces necessary."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Toronto. Great price. Total dive. Kensington is a great area to walk around and munch on tacos."}
{"text":"Definitely our go to place to try and we got an opportunity once. It was very nice sunny weather, and this place was busy. They have one bench that could seat 6 ppl max.
NOTE: Do not come here HUNGRY!!! $5 for half your hand sized soft tacos. We ordered quite a bit too, and definitely feel I'd fill better at other places for the price we've spent.

Two Gobernador ($5 each)- Has shrimp, tuna and a bunch of veggie and sauces on top. I thought this was alright.

Baja Fish ($5)- To our surprise, this is their better tasting taco. Still alright in my opinion though.

Blacked Mahi Mahi ($5)- This is a bit overcooked and bland to our liking.

Catch of the Day (Swordfish-$5). This was with avocado creme fraiche. This was dry to us as well. We didn't get their $2 Jarritos, b/c they ran out of Mango flavour. Maybe next time we may come back and hopefully get a better taste experience.

We also wanted to try their ceviche which they ran out of =(

Oh well, we can go next door and try 'Dirty Bird' OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH YEEEEAAAAAA!!!! BTW bring CASH!!!! Because 'Seven Lives is the CASH MAN!!!!'

We spent about $30! It could be less if you not hungry, but if you are, then it gets pricey for tacos...They also close by 7pm unless they sold out for the day, then they're done earlier..."}
{"text":"Like others have said before: the best tacos in the GTA. Everything on their menu is delicious. I would recommend the Baja, Gob, or Cerviche. 

Tip: get here early or it'll sell out!"}
{"text":"I always aim to come here when there's a chance the lineup may be shorter, but it's a tough call. Seven Lives is popular for a reason - the tacos are damned good. Fortunately, the folks working here are killer and the wait is never too long. I always get the carnita and baja fish tacos. Love the agua fresca and their salsas are quite tasty too. Summer in Kensington Market is better with a taco."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Toronto. I have been here a dozen times and the food is consistently great. If you are in the neighbourhood I would definitely recommend stopping in for a Gobernador! 

Don't worry if there is a line, it moves fast and it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"best tacos in the city. have the baja if you want your mind blown. they have carnitas if you arent preferential to fish but i highly recommend giving it a go"}
{"text":"The tacos are delicious - no doubt - and the taco included a very generous portion of fish. We got the basa fillet taco and the spicy shrimp one. The basa fish was a tiny bit bland but the fish tasted very fresh. The shrimp was deliciousssss... a bit sloppy since the sauce was dropping all over the place... but packed with flavour and just a hint of spice. The shrimp is definitely a must try! I also loveeee their flour tortillas which tasted very fresh and they double up the tortilla per taco. 

Four stars for in total since $6 is a bit pricey for one taco (even $5 is a lot better) but compared to some of the other taco joints, their tacos are definitely top notch in Toronto. Warning though, there are really no seats in this place, mostly just a pick up and go"}
{"text":"Tacos are alright but not as good as Grand Electric or La Carnita. There are few places to sit and eat your messy tacos and the menu is limited. Try it but then try La Carnita and Grand Electric. You'll see what I mean."}
{"text":"despite the consistently long line ups seven lives delivers consistent delicious mouth watering tacos. so worth the line! my favorite of the bunch is the spicy cheesey shrimp taco. please don't ever get rid of it!"}
{"text":"Great tacos, had the shrimp and smoked tuna and it was delicious. Chefs were having a great time preparing the food but the serving person didn't seem to know which ones were the better tacos. Would definitely go back again. Not too much room in there"}
{"text":"So went there on a Thursday night few weeks ago, around 7 PM.  We wanted to try the pulled pork tacos.  We got last 2, and were excited!  Not only were the pulled pork tacos extremely salty, there were two nice big globs of pork fat awaiting both of us as a surprise.  Guacamole on top was nothing special either.  I know i would have enjoyed Taco Bell more!  If there are delicious food here, we didn't find it that night, which goes to show you the food is not standard in quality."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best taco place Toronto has to offer. I've tried all of their tacos and the Gobernador is definitely my favourite. I usually get one of their freshly made juices to go with the tacos! ( the cucumber juice is a must) . The ceviche is also just as fresh and amazing and is enough to be shared between two people."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I told my wife we need to try this place.  The first time we went to Seven Lives it was closed  :-(  due to the extreme heat wave in TO.  That only augmented our desire to eat there.  Finally yesterday we made our way to Seven Lives and I have to say they serve decent tacos, better than most I have tried in a restaurant here in TO, but that in itself doesn't really mean much as the competition is weak, to mention one, close by is El Trompo with also -undeserved- glowing reviews.

We tried Governador, Baja and Mahi Mahi tacos.  The latter had a sweet taste that we didn't like.  Baja would be a better option but it seems the battered fish was deep fried in a oil that had been used for way too long and fried at a too low temperature, judging by the amount of old tasting oil the batter had adsorbed.  The one we liked the best was  Governador, the shrimps were cooked just the right way, they were really tender, unfortunately the shredded in unrecognizable very fine pieces smoked fish was so salty that I left half of a my second Governador taco uneaten (minus the shrimps :-)
BTW, I doubt the fish is actually smoked, it seems to me they just pan fry it adding a bit too much smoked chili powder, likely smoke-dried jalapeño otherwise known as chipotle.

When you go to most of the so called authentic taco places, the food may not be so authentic but the people serving you try to be authentic in hospitality.  At Seven Lives they don't care about making you feel welcomed, as my wife told me: a stone or rock would have better attitude and be more cheerful and friendly and that goes for the girl that places your order on the counter also.

Will I drive the 50 Km (2 ways) to go eat to Seven Lives?  the answer is no.  Will I eat there again if I feel like tacos and I happen to be near by? Well, I think I will toss a coin and let chance decide for us between El Trompo and Seven Lives.  May be I should find a 3 sided coin and add a third option!."}
{"text":"Get the Baja fish taco and you will feel as if you've been transported to a tacoria in the gulf of Mexico! This place has one of the best fish tacos I've ever had, and I've had many. Worth the line up - cash only."}
{"text":"I've never been to this place but I'm from California and they are closed today on a Tuesday. What kind of taco place is closed on taco Tuesday? Get your priorities straight."}
{"text":"I tried this place at lunch one day.

I ordered the baja fish and octopus tacos($5 each). The baja fish was my favourite. A very solid fish taco. I did not care much for the octopus. There was not much flavour though they give you a decent amount of octopus.

Overall I thought it was a decent taco place, but I like Tacos El Asador a lot better."}
{"text":"There was a lineup out the door when we went and we waited 20 minutes but it was worth it! The tacos are sizeable for $5 and just perfectly seasoned and proportioned with flavour. 

Ceviche was also authentically flavoured with lime but not super sour. Love that the tacos were home made and fried - they added a great crisp texture and saltiness."}
{"text":"Went in last night because I've heard so many good things about them and was excited to try them- no line up in front, but about 3 people waiting on their orders.  Stood at the counter for 5 minutes and no one even acknowledged our presence; no \"be right with you\", no eye contact, no \"just a sec\", no nod, no \"just finishing up these orders\".  Nothing.  It was like we were invisible.  So me & my invisible money left and went to another taco place (cheaper too) around the corner.  They might serve a great taco (I would have loved to try one), but with the amount of taco competition not only in Kensington, but Toronto, they need to learn some customer service.  I've heard a lot of La Carnita comparisons on the food and I rather take my money to La Carnita who have treated me great everytime."}
{"text":"Great food.  
Bad line.  
How do you complain that they're too busy and post a review that will only make the line worse?
Great food!  
Add 10 extra minutes."}
{"text":"Best bet in summer is to take your food to the nearby park to eat it. LOVE the ceviche tacos and delicious fruity drinks! I'd go here every day if I lived closer."}
{"text":"This is a great place. I come here often for lunch and find that two tacos is a great portion. For ten bucks, you really fill up as they load these tacos up. I've tried almost everything on their menu (not the al pastor as I am not a huge fan of pineapple in my savoury dishes), and generally love them all. The carnitas is easily my favourite, but I always have such a hard time choosing what to get as a second taco. The sauces they have are very tasty, I love spicy food, but be careful with their hot salsa as it is HOT. Yet it is nicely flavoured with garlic so if you can handle it, it is a must try. 

I recently started eating their poke and chips when I get a chance with other people. Unfortunately, when I go with only 1 other person, the tacos are too filling to get this, but when I go with 2 others or more, I always push for sharing this as it is really good. I would not think I would really enjoy how sweet they make this dish, but it works really well.

The only issue is space. If I can grab a seat or a section along the wall to stand and eat, I will. Otherwise, I often take my tacos over by the park on Augusta."}
{"text":"OK given that this place already has over 200 reviews, my 2 cents will probably be lost in the sea of rave reviews this place has received.

But let me just say that all those accolades are well deserved.

This place is hands down the best place for fish tacos in Toronto, period.

Yes it's small and seating is limited.
Yes the lines can be long during meals times.

But once those tacos hit your lips all those thoughts fall wayside.

It's just that good."}
{"text":"I dunno.  There's a lot of hype about this place, so maybe my expectations were too high.  We went on Sunday around 3 in the afternoon.  It was the last Sunday of the month, which means that Kensington Market is closed to pedestrians and there are even more people around than usual, and this restaurant was crazy busy.  The person taking the orders was friendly and very efficient which made me think it wouldn't be that long a wait, but it turns out they're very efficient at taking your money and really super, super inefficient at providing the food.  We had a long, long wait for our fish tacos, which were really ordinary.  They use mahi mahi, which is a very solid and not very flavourful fish.  There's a fair amount of batter, and I couldn't help thinking \"this is a Captain Highliner fish stick plopped on a taco\".  The fixings on the taco were unremarkable - some raw cabbage and a white sauce.  In theory you can add your own hot sauce, but two of the bowls of hot sauce were empty, and when I asked one of the people who were preparing the tacos if there was any chance of getting them filled up he made it clear that wasn't going to happen.

This place seems to be a victim of its own success.  It's too popular, they can't keep up with the volume either in terms of preparing the food in a reasonable amount of time or in terms of maintaining consistently good quality."}
{"text":"Best tacos outside of Mexico. Seriously I love this place. More of a place to frequent in good weather so you can go eat in the park. Otherwise, good luck getting a seat.
Carnita was a bit way too salty though - maybe I just got a less than stellar batch?"}
{"text":"I believe that every day should be Taco Tuesday so when I heard about this taco joint in Kensington I knew that I had to go and I must say that this place definitely lives up to the hype.

We arrived on a hot Saturday afternoon knowing that we would be greeted with a line up. We waited for about 20 minutes until our order was taken by an extremely nice lady! A lot of the time people taking orders seem to just be hating their life, but this girl was a nice and cheery surprise. We were very lucky that after we ordered our food, we snagged a spot at the table. If you are there with a friend I suggest that one of you scout out the tables while the other waits for all your food. I was lucky to be the closest to the table when someone left, as I say many other people with their eyes on it aswell.

We ordered 3 tacos: the Baja fish, the Blackened Mahi Mahi and the Gobernador. We also each ordered a Mexican grapefruit soda and the ceviche. To start, the Mexican sodas and the ceviche were both so refreshing on such a hot day. The Ceviche was probably my favourite part of the entire meal! When it comes to the tacos, they do NOT skimp on meat. After ordering all of our food we realized we probably could have stuck with 2 but it was nice to try a wider selection. The Maji Maji was my favourite as it was very light while the Baja Fish came in at a close second with a nicely balanced bread-to-meat ratio. The Gobernador was okay, but definitely not as good as the others--I would not order this again. 

PSA: The hot salsa is VERY hot. I am fairly good with spicy food but holy, this had a kick. We decided to douse the Baja Fish in the hot salsa and it became fairly unedible because it was just so spicy. A bit of it would have been fine, but make sure not to make the same mistake we did and taste it before you put it on everything!"}
{"text":"yo these tacos are the best for seriously oh my gawd these tacos are #1 forever baby!!!"}
{"text":"I love their tacos, they are the perfect blend of originality, quality, and consistency. I have had every single taco on the menu and I can find nothing bad to say about any of them.

And I totally loved them when they first opened, when you can get a taco in 5 minutes and even sit down to eat it. Now, though, you have to wait at least 30-45 minutes and then go to the park to eat it, which is a bit tough as you try to cradle your styrofoam container in your lap while taco juice is dripping down your elbow. I can't find any fault with their tacos, although these days sometimes I just don't want to wait that long to eat them in such an uncomfortable fashion.

Please - PLEASE get a bigger place."}
{"text":"The gobernador is amazing.  Unfortunately we ordered in a group and my order was missed so I had to wait a bit longer.

Wish there was more seating but all in all the tacos are so good it was worth it."}
{"text":"5 stars for tacos. 

Quaint, simple, delicious. Tacos from 4 to 7 dollars, cheap and easy. A great snack, a great meal, nothing fancy. Blackened Mahi Mahi seems to be their tastiest taco. 

If you are Kensington bound, be sure to grab your lunch at Seven Lives!"}
{"text":"A great hidden gem taco place on Kensington market , definitely do try the Mahi Mahi and the Black Merlin tacos with the 3 available salsa choices, the taco shells for sure could be a tad bit more tastier on their own , it lacks a good pinch of sea salt ."}
{"text":"Yes this place is that good. It's in the top three tacos places I've ever been to, out of hundreds and hundreds, having lived in California for years. 

I had the blue marlin and the blacked mahi mahi. Both outstanding. The salsas are great. Two tacos filled me up - and I tend to eat a lot - they're a pretty good size. I could see getting three but only if I had run twenty miles beforehand. Also the guac and chips looked great but I didn't try it - next time."}
{"text":"I went there last weekend and tried the octopus and the pork tacos ($5 each tax included). 
The octopus one was loaded with octopus, salsa and cabbage. I personally don't like cabbage but everything else was REALLY good! Totally recommend it. it said it was spicy but I didn't think it was that spicy so it was perfect for me. 
The pork taco was okay, it was more loaded with guacamole than anything else, but still pretty good. I was full with two tacos and one of their flavoured pop in a bottle (mandarin - for $2 tax included)
The only con of this place was that I went there on the weekend so the tiny place was PACKED with people waiting, they even had people lining up outside the door. They said I had to wait for 20 minutes, but I think I got my order sooner than that. lucky me!"}
{"text":"So. Good. Really fresh and high-quality ingredients including some of the best corn tortilla I have had in Toronto. Also great for peanut / nut allergy sufferers as they have been a nut-free kitchen whenever I have visited (although it's always good to check). I am looking forward to trying their pepitas mole on my next visit.

A little tough in winter because there's not a lot of seating, but still great for a nice snack or quick dinner on the go."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos for $5! Very fresh and flavourful! Venue is very small so many people are sitting about outside munching on this delicious food. Will definitely be back and showing this to all my out-of-town friends! :)"}
{"text":"Seven Lives is our go-to snack spot in the market. My favourite is the Baja fish. Every taco is unique, with a distinct flavour. I just don't like having to remember to bring cash!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best tacos I have ever tasted... I had the baja fish and the shrimp..the baja fish came with two deep fried mahi fish and a whole lot of good stuff.. once your tacos are ready, you have a choice if medium, mild, HOT sauce that you can put on your taco.. hands down you need to try this place!"}
{"text":"Small little take-out (very very dining area like 6 chairs max) taco joint but packs so much flavor in, service is understandable as its usually 2 or 3 people and they can only take so many orders. I had the baja fish taco and I can say its better than Joey's!"}
{"text":"The blackened mahi mahi taco with all of the salsas might be the best thing I have ever tasted in my life."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap and delicious place to eat, I highly recommend Seven Lives. Tucked away in Kensington market, no need to stress about what to wear or how much money you should bring. Just remember to bring cash. $5 tacos, 2 being enough to satisfy, but once you've taken your first bite, you'll want to try them all! Baha, carnitas, and Gobernador were mouthwateringly gratifying. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"We ordered the blackened mahi mahi, Gobernador and octopus tacos. Honeydew-citrus fresca was lightly sweet and good, something different. But that octopus taco...I'll keep thinking about it over the next few days. The flavours were so delicious. Worth the long line up."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fresh, reasonably priced...there's not much else to say except if you want fish tacos, go here."}
{"text":"If you enjoy Mexican food, especially tacos, this place should definitely be on your list to check out.

My friend and I ordered their baja fish taco, octopus taco and pork taco. The portion was generous, and all the ingredients were handled very well. I certainly enjoyed tasting every single one of them."}
{"text":"Fantastic spicy shrimp tacos! I was generous with the hot sauce, which was surprisingly very hot. Loved it. Great little joint for seafood tacos. The cevechi was refreshing and tasty for a sunny afternoon. I also had their honeydew fresh juice, not a huge fan of it, but it was good. I thought a lemonade would've been fantastic with the meal. I will def be going back!"}
{"text":"4/5! This place would have gotten a 5 out of 5, however, the day I went there were no vegetarian options. I checked online and there was no indication that the staf would serve non-veg options ONLY- so unfortunately, some of my friends were unable to try the tacos. So my advice to vegetarians is to call ahead of time and confirm the menu for that day. I had the baja fish taco and it is probably the best fish taco I have had it Toronto. Overall, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really good tacos. One of the best I've had in the city. My only complaint is there really isn't anywhere to eat. I get it's Kensington, but they could maybe put some standing tables outside instead of the benches."}
{"text":"This is the first place I've given 5 stars. I tried 4 of their tacos and loved each one of them. The blackened mahi mahi, baja, grilled octopus and catfish tacos were all amazing. They each had different toppings which went well with the different styles of filling. 

They had some awesome habanero sauce too. Def gave the tacos some extra kick!!"}
{"text":"It's a small place; only a single table. I got two tacos. The marlin and shrimp taco is amazing. Definitely recommend trying that. The spicy chicken taco was a decent, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have tried when coming for a quick bite! The shell tastes so fresh which pairs nicely with the fresh ingredients inside."}
{"text":"Always a line, but it moves fairy fast. These are the best tacos I've had outside of San Diego, California. Got the halibut of course and I inhaled it...  So did my wife. But then I ate faster, so I ate half of her taco as well."}
{"text":"Yup they take interac now.  Today's line-up was not that bad so got to enjoy my fav tacos again. Wish they would open a west-end location ..."}
{"text":"Got the spicy shrimp and the deep fried Baja fish.... The spicy shrimp was flavorful and was dressed really well... The deep fried Baja fish lacked flavor and left me unsatisfied.... My brother got the blacked Mahi Mahi... That was more flavorful.... All in all its an awesome place for a quick bite for a really good price... $5 for some fresh tacos... Yum!!! The place itself is super small and only one table to sit and eat and a corner to stand..."}
{"text":"BEST TACOS EVER! This Taco Stand Just Opened Up And Has Won My Heart With One Bite. Seven Lives Tacos Focuses On SoCal And Tijuana Seafood For Their Creations Made At Their Shop In Kensington Market. They Also Focus On Buying Local, As With Many Of The Dedicated 'Market' Businesses And Also Provide A Friendly Atmosphere. But Let Me Tell You About The Tacos. I Originally Had The Loaded Gobernador (Smoked Marlin, Shrimp And Cheese) And Had A Mouth Orgasm After One Bite. Later Mary Came By For Lunch And We Tried The Smoked Mahi-Mahi...also A Winner. For $5 Even It's A Steal. John, The Owner, Also Says His Carnitas (Pork And Pork Belly) For $3 Is A Popular Buy, And Is On My List For Next Time. I Believe Seven Lives Has The Potential To Become A Legendary Taco Establishment. Come Out And Visit This Toronto GEM And See, I Mean Taste, What I Am Talking About. See You Tomorrow! What's Next?"}
{"text":"Went to check out this place after all the positive reviews and hype. I found the tacos pretty average nothing extraordinary. Firstly had to wait in a line for about 25 mins. There is now tax added onto your meal which based on past reviews wasn't the case. I got the Gobernador and the Octopus taco. I liked the Gobernador but wasn't a huge fan of the octopus. The octopus was over cooked and was chewy. The taco itself was lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"I love this place and I've been here many times for lunch. The flavours are great and it's $5 per taco and I usually get two.  The only thing about this place is that its very small so don't expect to sit down with your taco... and the lines are usually long.  I come here on my lunch break and there have been times where I've had to go elsewhere because the line was too long; for that reason, I knocked off a star.  So far I've tried the octopus, Baja fish,  Mahi Mahi,  cactus and cheese and the ceviche. 

Octopus taco - it's octopus in mole sauce and this is my favourite taco

Baja taco - deep fried Mahi Mahi and I like this one a little better than the blackened Mahi Mahi

Mahi Mahi - blackened Mahi Mahi with some flavourful spices

Cactus and cheese - I like this one the least. The taste isn't bad but the cactus and cheese make this a heavy taco and even though they double up on the corn tortilla, it falls apart and becomes really messy to eat.  Try not to let this one sit too long.

Ceviche - they have daily specials for ceviche so you'll have to ask what the currently have. I had a shrimp and tilapia one and it was very fresh tasting.

Tasty food in a tiny place :)"}
{"text":"best tacos in the city. hands down. super busy but if you just believe that a spot will open up by the time you order & get your tacos then IT WILL. every. time."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is all about. We got the baja, gobernador, and black pepper marlin. 

The baja while crispy didn't offer much flavour. It tasted pretty bland. 

The black pepper marlin was also pretty disappointing in that we can't get much flavour out of it. 

The Gobernador has flavour but the flavour of the tuna is masked by so many other ingredients in this dish that it didn't feel special at all."}
{"text":"Yummy...I only wish they opened alittle earlier. Heading there at 12pm opening, a line was already formed. Its a very popular small taco joint. The food and service is great. Its the taco that will always make you come back here. My favourite is the fish taco and shrimp. Carnitas is also good but I guess I'm a purist and prefer the simple preparation of it.
Portions are big, 2 tacos at $5 a piece will fill you up!"}
{"text":"D-LISH!!!  

Hope the owners will open up a sit-down restaurant one day with lots of seats!"}
{"text":"Order: 
Gobernador: Smoked tuna and spicy shrimp, flavorful and juicy
Baja Fish: Fried white fish taco was fresh and crispy, just like you'd expect from a quality taco shop
Both came with fresh veges, coleslaw and salsa of your choice

Overall the Tacos were delicious, at $5 a pop it's not overly expensive for the quality. The hours for this place isn't ideal for an after work meal so be mindful if you get off work late and want to swing by for a late dinner. They might even be sold out before their official closing hours, so come early!

note: This place is obviously not a sit down place as there's pretty limited seating for most places in Kensington market, but if you just come for the food alone you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yummy taco placo! It is right in the hood which offers a great deal of delicous food ranging from quick to-go-grab foods to fine cuisines. Took an advice from the review here and had a fish and a shrimp taco. If u r in mood to go Mexican, definetely wanna try it here"}
{"text":"Finally, a taco to be proud of in our city!

Carnitas taco is amazing along with the Camarones a la diabla.
Nothing to complain about, except the first time we went, my boyfriend (who is Mexico so spice is in his blood) and I got all ballsy and put A LOT of habanero salsa on our tacos, and it was too hot to handle.
These gringos do it right.  Super friendly and efficient with the small work space they've got.

One thing, which isn't criticism of this place but of the 214 Augusta complex, is that the patio could definitely use some sprucing up and while they are renovating the interior, it could use some love as well. 

Anyway, I hope to see this place evolve and grow and will definitely be giving it my business for times to come.

They also have aguas frescas (horchatas, aguas de jamaica etc.) that change from day to day and are a steal at $1 a glass."}
{"text":"This is a bit tex mex, not quite Mexican.

I had carnitas and they were way greasier than they are supposed to be.  In fact, so greasy that both tortillas didn't suffice.  I used about 10 napkins.  

Mexican Tacos don't have guacamole on them & both of the one's I ordered, did.  

Why are people surprised that they cost only $5.  Tacos are street food in Mexico."}
{"text":"With almost 300 reviews and 4.5 stars this was a place I had to check out.  I was not disappointed... It really is worth 5 stars.  They were very busy and seeing that it was cash only, I went to the bank to get some cash.  At first the crowd inside was a bit intimidating because I wanted to be able to sit and enjoy my food.   The crowd moves quickly ... Both in getting the food and in freeing up space to sit and grab a bite.  There are stand up places to eat as well.  We ordered the cactus and mushroom and the mahi mahi as the carnitas were all sold out for the day.  Loved the prices as jt only came to $11 and included a fresh papaya juice for only $2.  The juice was phenomenal!  I can't believe they only charge $2 for it.  Both tacos were amazing and the salsa too!  Tried the green (medium) salsa and then went back for the hot one.  Both were amazing and the hot one was worthy of being called hot.  Amazing taco experience and would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Tacos are $5+ and extremely tasty. Plan on getting 3 as they are a bit petite but holy cow are they good. Not very much space to sit but the street is packed with plenty to observe while enjoying this treat!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with the Gobernator. I used to avoid this place because the line out the door was daunting, but my friends insisted I give it a try. 

I walked in a few weeks ago and asked the friendly Australian counter staff what his favourite menu item was. He replied \"Gobernator, hands down.\"

I just finished my fifth one since then, and it's too delicious to try anything else. The chewy shrimp, the meaty mahi fish, and the creamy sauce are perfect together. 

After reading the reviews here, I think I'll have to try the Baja fish next. 

I'd give 6 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"You should eat here! I saw someone else posted the menu board, it's simple, delicious and cheap. Although, the prices are for just one taco. There's really nowhere to sit and the line goes out the door but there's a park around the block so if it's sunny out you've got a picnic. I found the strawberry agua fresca way too sweet but the watermelon was fine."}
{"text":"Lots of fish tacos. At $5 each, i think its a bit pricey for me. Tried the blackened Mahi-Mahi which was average at most. The Baja fish taco though was something that I would come back again for. It was cooked really crispy but not burned. Also had the ceviche and the serving was massive and surprisingly tasty."}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is as good as it gets. The flavours and portion totally justifies the price.

Baja fish taco - no place does it as good as this place. I've tried a few other places were great runner ups, but this one wins first place.

Octopus - very interesting, and tasty. However, it doesn't have a mexican taste to it. It kind of tastes like it's been marinaded by soy sauce. 

Blacken fish taco - this was runner up to the baja fish tacos. Although it was good, it was no competitor to the baja fish taco.

Watermelon juice - very refreshing on a hot summer day, but nothing too special. 

My only complaint is that it only takes cash! It's almost 2016... there's no excuse for not accepting debit and credit.

p.s there's only 1 table that can seat 4 people."}
{"text":"Super tasty tacos! They are consistently good - my fiancé and I look forward to getting these as a treat almost every week! Only wish they had a larger location as this place is so popular that not everyone can fit when ordering food and waiting and there is definitely not enough space to sit and eat comfortably. Luckily we live close by so we just order and take them home."}
{"text":"The poke is delicious and good value. My favourite taco is the pulpo (octopus). Service is cheerful and efficient."}
{"text":"Been here twice within 2 months. The sign is a little obscure as we almost missed it the first time. The tacos were sooo good we want to come back everytime we go to downtown. Tried the gobernator, baja fish, pulled pork, halibut, all good. The spiciest sauce was very spicy the fist time we tried. Sweat was coming off the back of the head... but the second time tasted milder...
5 bucks for a taco is not cheap but the ingredients quality n ample portion made up for it.
One complaint,  pulled pork was a tad over grilled but still tasty. Can't wait to go back again. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious and the price is reasonable for the size of the taco. It's snack-size. The only problem is the store itself is so small so there's high chance that you'll to be standing and eating, maybe without even a table."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos. Line can be tough and not much space to eat inside but the quality makes up for it."}
{"text":"The tacos are my favourite tacos in the city. Despite this, since they put ceviche on the menu I don't bother ordering the tacos anymore. Just ate the \"salmon poke tostada\" ceviche special. The best $9 I have spent on food in this city. That much raw salmon in a sushi restaurant would have cost me $45 and tasted half as good. Other restaurants can give up, Seven Lives wins."}
{"text":"Long waits, little seating, messy to eat and sold out items are all perils worth dealing with to eat this excellent food.

I wont get into the \"authenticity\" debate that everyone has their back up against the wall over (honestly who cares if its authentic? the only place you get authentic anything is the original source) but I will say this: the quality of the ingredients that go into each taco is well above any other place in Toronto. Big pieces of real grilled/smoked fish, good chunks of chicken, whole shrimp (tail off) etc. Home made sauces, etc. Doesn't sound like anything different than other taco shop? Try it and youll see what I mean. Not only is the quality and attention to detail there; the flavour is the best in town. You'll completely rethink the taco after eating here. 

$5-7 a taco, youll only need 2."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos I've had in the city :) Still craving some so will be returning again this week! 
I had two of the baja tacos which are the fried mahi mahi.  My coworkers loved the shrimp ones, so I'll try one of those next!
The price is reasonable ($5 taxes in) given the size. For example, the baja had two pieces of fried fish - when I've gone to other taco places in the city, they come w/ only one piece of fish.  The shrimp tacos had at least 6 good sized shrimp. 
There's next to no seating in here though, so best to expect to stand outside to eat your tacos :)
Pretty busy but the line goes fast. PS Cash only."}
{"text":"The mahi mahi tuna taco is by my favourite on the menu. I have dreams about it. The cactus taco- probably will never order again. The baja and gobernardor.. good but not worth enduring the very likely long line and wade of people trying wolf down their food. The poke and chips is a generous portion and definitely worth trying. 

Also be warned the hot sauce is very hot."}
{"text":"I love tacos, and so far this is the best taco place I've tried in Toronto. The only downside is that it gets really busy and there is no seating to enjoy their delicious food! Most of the time have to settle for eating on the bench outside with no table."}
{"text":"These tacos actually blew my mind. If Simon fed me these tacos and told me to do a backfilp, I would have done it (but I  can't do a backflip). 

I can't remember which tacos I had, but as they say, you never remember what people said, just how they made you feel. And these tacos made me feel AWESOME. 

Again, it could be just that I love tacos. I love the format. A bunch of stuff in a wraapping that you eat with your hands? So wonderfully messy. I love it. 

Their guacomole is citrusy and light, their sauces are spicy, and the meat is juicy. Deep flavours to be found here."}
{"text":"This is the best taco place in the city. It would be the best taco place in a lot of cities. Seafood is their speciality and would be the only drawback if you're not a fan, but otherwise this place is well ahead of the Grand Electric's and La Carnita's in the city."}
{"text":"They have the best fish tacos HANDS DOWN in Toronto!! It's always busy and there are so many choices for tacos. You can't go wrong no matter which one you choose. 

P.S Cash only"}
{"text":"Guys. Blacked Mahi Mahi. This is literally the best taco I have ever eaten. I love tacos. I will happily pay $5 for a taco-- even at La Carnita, where you need at least 3 to fill up because they're tiny. I've eaten tacos all over the city. But this... this is perfection. The generous portion of delicious guacamole on top of a perfectly seasoned fish... it's everything you've ever dreamed of. So worth the wait and squishing into a tiny room in Kensington Market. Amazing."}
{"text":"There are some things i don't like about this place. Such as the extremely limited seating(there is one table that seats four), and it is a bit overpriced. However, the tacos are de-lic-ous. Especially the gobernador, my knees buckled when i took a bite. I also ordered the cactus and mushroom. Don't get it. It pales in comparison to the big gob, which is only $1 more."}
{"text":"What an awesome spot with an awesome story.  I loved the fish tacos.  Not the biggest fan of the blackened catfish taco, but the other two fish taco were da bomb.  Keep on, keeping' on."}
{"text":"Um.... what do I say that hasn't already been said? 
Tacos are dece but they aren't even genuine mexican I don't think. Dude wasn't mexican so idk. Anwyays its 2 expensive ."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that I have never been here before!!!! Went for the first time yesterday, had the famous fish tacos, and Mmmm they were so good. Def recommend this place. Two tacos were filling. Its a pretty small place thou"}
{"text":"I heard so many good things about Seven Lives that I had to try it out. We went there on a Friday evening around 7PM and the tiny place was still very busy. The place is set up for takeout orders even though they have a few tables and a countertop. The guy who took out order seemed to be impatient and pointed it out that they would close at 8PM and we should hurry to order our tacos. I was not very impressed with the \"courteous\" treatment as we had 1 hour to order our tacos. Anyway I had the fish taco and the pork one. It was not memorable at all. I had better tacos at Grand Electric, Pancho & Emiliano, and even Against the Grain.
 
We share our table with a father and daughter duo. I pointed to them that they should try, Pancho & Emiliano (a Mexican place two blocks down). They shared a fish taco and came back to give me the two thumbs up.
 
It was ok but I honestly don't see a reason to come back there. I can find better street food at other Kensington Mkt vendors."}
{"text":"The spicy shrimp taco has rich creamy cheesy spicy sauce to die for. The shrimp is fresh."}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5/5.

This shop is tucked away on Kensington Avenue. It's a small space, with limited seating. Best visited in pairs.

My friend and I had the following items:

1) Mango and Strawberry Agua Fresca

I've had Agua Fresca in Mexico, and I'm sure it's not fair to compare, but this one was very light on the fruit profile. For $2, it was at a great price point, but the freshness of the fruit in question didn't sing out to me.

2) Daily Ceviche

I enjoyed this dish. Tonight it was prepared with Shrimp and Tilapia, and the lime used to marinate the seafood added that zippy zing that is so necessary in ceviche. I also liked the mashed avocado smeared on the Tostada. Nice play on textures!

3) The Gobernador (Smoked Marlin, Shrimp, and Cheese)

This is the #1 ordered item on the menu here. However, I personally found the smoke on the fish to be quite overwhelming. Marlin is an inherently oily fish, and perhaps the smoke was used to mask that, but it just didn't work for me. Combined with the shrimp and cheese, it was a hodgepodge of flavours that didn't complement each other.

4) Blackened Mahi Mahi

I love the rub on the fish! I think there was cinnamon in the mix, which lent a sweet flavour to the fish. I've never seen that before in blackening spice. Very unique! 

The portion sizes are substantial as many reviewers have pointed out before me. 2 Tacos a person is plenty. 

There's a salsa station where you are encouraged to top your tacos. I tried the Habanero and Pasilla salsas. Truth is, I think they overwhelmed the fish. I would skip them the next time around.

Grand Electric still has my favourite Tacos in the city. I think their flavour profiles are a little more well thought out, and complex."}
{"text":"Good fish tacos, even better shrimp tacos! The hot sauce is perfection! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"There is a lot of mediocre mexican restaurants in Toronto.... ahem el catrin....cough cough ...bad bad.....

This place is not.. a little shop inset in kensington. These cats know tacos.... The Gobernador and the Blackened Mahi Mahi are crafted with fresh accompaniments. There is a reason there is always a line, don't fret the line is quick and the taco's are reasonable and as good as you will get in Mexico (and I said it right)"}
{"text":"Tiny tiny place with nowhere to sit and always extremely busy. A taco place that is not owned by a Mexican but close to authentic mexican food. The shrimp tacos are my favourite and they have good choices of sauces and drinks. i wish they had a more varied menu but i would still come back for those shrimp tacos if i feel like standing and eating."}
{"text":"I tried the shrimp taco and the dish taco. The shrimp taco was cheesy and wonderful. The fish taco was crispy and fresh. I loved them both and would recommend this place to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"These have to be the best tacos in Toronto. So good and messy. 
They're best eatten standing outside in the street while the taco juices drip all over the place. I especially love the fresh juices, when they have them. Very light and refreshing a good balance to hot tacos. I've been there many times and they keep me going back to Kensington market."}
{"text":"I was never a fan of Mexican food until I had this!

The carnitas taco was amazing! I'm not a big fan of pork normally, but this was my favorite. It was packed with flavor. The salsas are amazing too. Plenty of heat with amazing pepper flavor. 
The fish taco was good, but paled in comparison and I usually prefer fish tacos. Only disappointment was not being able to try the other tacos as they sold out."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience.  I ate here based on the reviews and ordered 3 tacos. I found they all had to much sauce, conflicting flavors and to much stuff inside each taco.  Good high quality tacos are a less is more approach and let the fish do the talking. I would not recommend or return."}
{"text":"This place is in the heart of Kensington Market, it is small and I rarely get a table when I go, but the tacos are fresh, so tasty and delicious.  Service is always friendly and relatively fast considering the consistent line up.  The camarones a la diabla is my favourite taco by far.  Yep, they are expensive for $5 a taco, but the taco itself is huge and super filling so at most you would eat two, that's a $10 meal, sounds good to me.  Also, during the summer they make agua de fresa with local fruits from the market like watermelon or strawberry or limes - super refreshing!  Worth the line up and worth scarfing down while standing up or sitting on the side walk as you people watch."}
{"text":"The best quality mexican styled seafood ceviche ive had in toronto. The ceviche priced at $7 is def a must-try dish along with the baja tacos priced at $5. The ceviche is slightly small for two people but filling for one person. The battered fish in baja tacos is crispy and perfectly fried. The only downside to the restaurant is that it allows only stand up and can get easily over crowded. Def a ideal place for a quick flavorful bite on the go!"}
{"text":"Always a favorite! Greatest hole in the wall restaurant: ) and real corn tortillas.  Everything is great, just needs more seating and open more often"}
{"text":"Basically the best taco in Toronto. The Gobernator (not sure about the spelling) was delish! Beware of the hot sauce...... it's really, REALLY hot."}
{"text":"The tacos were definitely great, but I'm not sure about \"best in the city\". Definitely flavorful, decent value for money, and filling. A good piece of advice would be to be careful with the spicy sauce! The hottest one has ghost pepper in it and a little will go a long way. My main gripe with this place would be the size - it can make you feel a little claustrophobic since there's nowhere to sit, but I guess that's the case for a lot of Kensington market spots. Service was good, even though we paid with mostly change."}
{"text":"Mahi Mahi and Baja FTW! And their daily fresh juice is the killer. You can't go wrong with it!"}
{"text":"You MUST try these tacos. Chowed down my Carnita Taco ($5) before I even remembered to take a picture. It's a HUGE portion for one taco and the meat is amazingly crispy let alone the delicious guac. Worth every penny and worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp tacos and they were delicious !! Well worth the wait. The only con is that it is a little pricey - $5 per taco."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos! I tried the blackened mahi mahi and the baja fish. Both were very tasty and I don't have a favorite. If you like avocado get the blackened mahi, if not get the baja fish. I expected to have very little room to eat, and I was right, but it wasn't offensive. I just stood there amongst other standing folk, ate my tacos like a champ, and left. Bing, bang, boom. I love the surrounding area, and it's easy to duck in here for a quick bite. One taco will do for a snack, two for a meal."}
{"text":"I remember I had eaten here a long time ago, and it was Baja fish I ordered.  My impression was it tastes absolutely delicious.  The ingredients tastes quite fresh and well balanced.  The taco was loaded with piping hot toppings and it was sumptuous for a fish taco.  The hot sauce is great and can burn you up if not prepared.  I didn't come here very often because of the usual long line up, and there was not much standing area inside and felt very crowded inside with the line up.  Had this another day during lunch time when line up wasn't too crazy.  Still took a good 15 min wait.  Ordered grill octopus and catch of the day.  This time around the impression is still good, but not like the first time.  The taco is still loaded with topping, but something doesn't feel right.  First of all the octopus didn't taste that fresh and it was overloading the tortilla made it really messy to eat.  The catch of day was good but not memorable like first time.  Maybe I should have stick with Baja fish and gobenator.  Overall it's a good place to grab a quick bite provided the line up is not crazy."}
{"text":"Tacos were amazing. Baja fish taco is by far the best one there. I can't remember the other ones I had but be sure to get this one at the very least. The space is smaller as they only have one or two tables for sit down. Dishes are fairly large so no need to get a ton of these. Wish the store was open for longer but you can see why it's only open for 7 hours or so....their food runs out because of how busy it gets!"}
{"text":"Had the blue marlin taco - was PHENOMENAL.  The Guac was as good as Chipotle and the marlin was grilled to perfection.

The flavour was rich and had the right amount of seasoning.  Not too salty not too flat.  DON'T ADD EXTRA SALT!!!

Overall for $6 - totally worth the hype line up."}
{"text":"It's a good snack place outside of the peak hours (i.e. lunch time) when its impossibly busy. The place itself is very small but generally you may at least snag a spot at the standing counter to eat your taco by the time your order is ready. The tacos are a little to saucy in my opinion, but they taste good. The Gobernador is a personal favourite, but I also enjoyed all the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Tasty tacos, however they were tiny. I'm 160 lbs and bench 225 lbs, and two tacos were barely a snack. Definitely could easily end spending 20+ here. 

Also watch out for the hot sauce, cried all the way home."}
{"text":"Good tacos, (exceptionally good tortillas) and good value. The portions are huge. Very limited seating and some of the flavour combos are a little off (Octopus and pumpkin tahini especially). The Mahi Mahi is blackened with a strange spice rub...with cloves? Really the only two good ones were Baja and carnita. The sauces however are excellent. Not my favourite taco shop for sure,  but it is pretty good."}
{"text":"Tried the Baja fish taco and it's just as good as everyone says.  Hot sauce is amazing!!! Great kick to it.  Will definitely be coming back regularly"}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos are to die for. All tacos are delicious. My only complaint is that the shop is small and often there is a line up out the door with no place to sit or stand and eat. This is troublesome in the winter months. Definitely worth a visit though, even better if the weather is warm!"}
{"text":"Baja fish taco & gobernador = amazing. Also had the real fruit juice (honeydew) at the counter (had real pieces of fruit floating in my drink). All were delicious. Came back a little while later for blackened mahi and the carnitas and they were good but not as good as the Baja or the gobernador (but still plenty tasty). Really nice lady punched in the orders/handled the cash register. I am doing a taco run in the city and I have to say that these were better than the ones I had at grand electric."}
{"text":"Finally hopping on this bandwagon! Definitely been meaning to try this place and finally got the chance to try out this place last Sunday. It's a tiny little shop in Kensington Market and you can easily miss it if you aren't looking out for it. Be sure to have cash as this place is cash only! 

This place was packed on a Sunday at around 1pm and it was definitely a party in there. Get comfy and cozy with the other customers since you will be in close proximities with others. Despite being packed the line was moving quite quick. The cashier was super friendly and patiently took my order- the service was wonderful considering the long line. Waited for a bit and got my tacos- I had the Gobernador taco and the blackened Mahi Mahi taco. I also noticed their ceviche looks amazing! They had their own sauces with different levels of spiciness. Deciding to brave it- I got ballsy and decided to top my taco off with the hot one. Beware when they say it's hot, it is HOT. Their mild sauce was also quite delicious.

They have a use two corn tortilla for each of their tacos and I found kept the taco together. Using corn tortilla as oppose to flour tortilla used by most places, really did make a difference in its taste and made it overall feel less heavy.

The Gobernador was properly my favourite out of the two, it was extremely flavourful even without adding the hot sauce. Now with the hot sauce, it's a whole different story- it definitely kicked it up a notch. This one was the favourite out of the two- the shrimp and the tuna just went together perfectly. It does come with jalapenos so it's slightly spicy.

The Blackened Mahi Mahi came with guacamole (unlike other places that charge you for extra) which paired nicely with the fresh tomatoes and cabbage.

Will definitely be come by again, since they are one of the best place for tacos in the city. I found it affordable compared to some of the taco places that aren't as good and is more expensive."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and love absolutely everything I've had. They usually have something new to try and I'm never disappointed. My favourites are the Octopus and smoked marlin tacos...can't remember their official names. They are very friendly and happy to make anything gluten-free."}
{"text":"Ok this is one of my favourites,

After reading many reviews, I wanted to know why this place gets such good reviews.

Tacos are one of my favourite things to eat, and the reviews I read are right. The tacos here are amazing. I hade the shrimp tacos, to die for, my boyfriend had the fish tacos, I had a bit and it was so good, and we shared a ceviche ..... Yummy!

The only reason why I am giving it a 4 and not a 5 is because the place is always super busy, long lines and not enough room to eat. The place is very small, I had to eat in my car. 
I hope one day they decide to open up a bigger location with a larger eating area. I would definitely go :)"}
{"text":"This small and friendly Kensington taqueria offers a sea food heavy menu. This was without a doubt the best taco I had this side of the 49th. The tacos are big and tasty. The juices are delicious and reasonably priced. There is very little seating but the flavor justifies this slight inconvenience. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I lived in southern California for almost two years and I know good tacos - Seven Lives is AWESOME!!! So glad they popped in Toronto. Everything is delish and the staff are great! Glad you guys are open everyday now. yay!"}
{"text":"Delicious fish tacos but not a lot of room to eat them in the venue."}
{"text":"Had the blackened mahi mahi and the battered shrimp and if I had the money I would walk back there this second and buy them again.

Delicious guac and the (homemade?) hot sauces are FINALLY hot enough"}
{"text":"This place was definitely worth a visit because of the hype.  I've been wanting to try Seven Lives on many occasions, but usually give up after seeing the long lineups which always snakes along the street.  You know a place is good if they always have a lineup no matter which day.  I even attempted going during off peak hours to no avail, except for one lucky Friday afternoon, I was finally able to taste the terrific tacos.

I met a friend there and she was smart for arriving a little early, but because I was running a little late she had ordered first, so she can snag a table.  I arrived shortly after she placed her order and lucky for me, there were only three people in line ahead of me.

I ordered the Gobernador (smoked tuna and shrimp), blackened Mahi mahi and Baja fish tacos, I was definitely not disappointed.  Everything was cooked nicely and seasoned well with the right amount of garnishes. Probably the best tacos I had in my life!  No wonder why so many people don't mind waiting in line for the scrumptious tacos. It was absolutely worth the wait in line!  I was just lucky to get there before the actual long line formed.

Tacos were reasonably priced at $5 each, plus the freshness of the ingredients and the tastiness of each tacos made it a great deal.  Three tacos were definitely enough for me, but if you don't have much of an appetite two orders of tacos will be sufficient.

I have been to many taco places, and I can now say that Seven Lives has to be the best one by far.  Now I can see why friends insisted I eat here and did I mention it was definitely worth the wait!

Come and get your tacos while they last as they do sell out quick and don't forget to bring cash!"}
{"text":"Upon the recommendation of our teenaged son, we went to Seven Lives yesterday. We ordered the shrimp, blackened mahi mahi, pulled pork and the baha fish tacos. We found the shrimp taco to be absolutely delicious. The Baja taco's were a hit. One person who had never had fish taco's before absolutely devoured this taco. She loved it so much that she had a second one. The blackened mahi mahi was good but I found there was an aftertaste to the fish. The pulled pork was very good. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I hate this restaurant. 

I hate how this place has ruined tacos for me.  I can't get tacos anywhere else without being disappointed.  I hate how this place is a black hole for your money, sucking you in, constantly reaching into your wallet while you stand on their chest high tables, helpless to the smell of Gobernador's and their delicious salsas.  I hate how I no longer dream of my girlfriend, but of their tacos, lining up single file into my mouth.  I despise how every bite of a taco means less taco on my tray, that the happiness my throat is feeling is limited as the taco is not an endless entity but just two tortillas with whatever the hell they put into it to make my life complete.  I hate that they don't take debit because I cannot spend all of my savings on these tacos.

Enough of the hyperboles though, this place has some really good tacos.  I was initially turned off by the price of each taco as they are $5 each before tax but then $5.65 afterwards.  The tacos are worth it.  There will most likely be a line and there is only one table to eat it with shelves hanging off the wall to eat off of.  I dread the inevitable line and the limited seating, but the tacos are worth it.  I love these tacos.  I wish I was a taco from seven lives.  Eat here, I am confident that you will like it but if you don't then I apologize but damn I really like it here.  Good stuff Seven Lives.  5/5."}
{"text":"I previously had the octopus and grill fish tacos before and they were $6 or $7 for 2. That was a few months ago.

I came back last weekend and they increased the price: $5 for 1!! Just FYI... It was a Sunday afternoon, so there was a line and the place was really crowded. But the wait wasn't long, maybe 15min in total. I finally ordered their famous deep fried fish taco. I am normally not a fish taco kind of person, but their menu is pretty limited.... Anyways, I see why everyone likes their fish tacos! Amazing! My friend who loves fish tacos also says that it's one of the best in the city. Another friend had the cactus taco (vegetarian) but it was just ok."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have had north of San Francisco!"}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos. The price point is okay but those tacos are definitely worth it. The sauce in particular adds quite a bit of a kick which really lift the tacos to a different level."}
{"text":"AMAZING! One of the best taco spots in Toronto. The food is fresh and so good. I always get the Gobernador. Their freshly made juices are also very good. definitely worth the price and wait!"}
{"text":"The most incredible thing this great city has to offer. When you enter the establishment you feel like you're in the presence of something special, waves of happiness wash over you as you place your order and watch fellow Foodies devour their coveted delicious tacos. Gobernator is my go to, can't go wrong, homemade hot sauce is a must. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yummy tacos! Made right then and there. Small place but it was OK because it wasn't during the busy times."}
{"text":"The place was easy to find and is located at street level. Mostly standing area with one large table able to seat 6-8 people at best. The cashier was no fuss which I don't mind but make sure you know what you want and pay accordingly with cash. The wooden floors are layered over existing tile and there was a hole 1 ft wide near the large table. It goes about 2.5 inches deep so if you're not paying attention you can trip while getting your sauces.

Food: the meat (chicken) was seasoned really good for me and freshly cooked. Although the meat to tortilla ratio was good it can't justify the 6$ price tag on it. If you buy 2 you would expect it to fill you up at the cost of 12$ plus tax but it seems more like something that could tide you over until you eat your actual meal lol. Also their system of serving people is by grouping the orders of many customers and pulling out the ingredients in batches. It seems like an efficient system that keeps the ingredients cold and avoid cross contamination but during peak times and added stress it really slows down the service. So be patient when buying and expect 8-15 min wait during peak dinner times. Also I noticed a disparity between how hard one worker was trying to piece together the orders while some cooks acted more lax because their only job was to remember what to cook and put it in paper trays so it kind of made me feel bad to contribute to the 1 overworked employee. 

 It's not the be all end all taco place and the only taco place in Toronto or the surrounding GTA but it's good points is having alot of variety on the menu with well cooked meat. I would give it more than 2 stars but it matched other typical taco places (that offer the same for 1-2$ less) while the prices were too high if buying multiples."}
{"text":"Went to kensington twice this week just to try this place during the coldest days of winter. It was def worth it.

I had the carnita and mahi mahi. Both were good and very filling. Lots of flavour in the tacos and lots of fresh ingredients. Having had tacos from grand electric, Buster's sea Cove's fish taco and gourmet gringos, I have to say their mahi mahi wasn't the best i've had. But the Carnita was great and a steal at $3. 

The place was quit difficult to find. It's a great hidden gem."}
{"text":"They are THAT good.  Large enough that two will fill you up,  and the fish is not at all underwhelming (as is often the case at TO quick service restaurants). Tried the Mahi Mahi and the smoked tuna and shrimp. Big line,  cash only,  little room to eat... But boy that's a good taco."}
{"text":"So here's the real deal !!!

This place is the bomb.  
Taxes are included in the price 
The owner is a Rad dude who grew up in California. Taco stand capital of United States 
If all you had was four dollars to your name every day you could live off the amount of food received an one taco from this place. 
The quality is great for what it is 
The amount of food for the price can't be beat. 
The Vibe is Kensington at its best. 
Short wait times but when it's not it's still worth the wait. 
I'm a big guy and two of any of these bad ass TACOS fill me up so much I need a wheel-barrel. 

The Real Truth 
Glenn"}
{"text":"it's hard to describe just how much of a gem this place is, but I'll try - it's where God decided he wanted to live.

taco heaven. that's what this spot is.

the tuna and the octopus are to die for. plus they have specials every couple weeks. 

well worth the line up out the door. every single time."}
{"text":"If there is one place that you'd go to get tacos, this is it. They specialize in seafood tacos, but there is a vegetarian option if you need one. Personally I always order (and highly recommend) the octopus one.

Some places often overcook octopus and make it difficult to chew and it'll feel like you're munching on rubber. But Seven Lives seems to know just the right amount of time to do it so that it's easy to eat and deliciously flavored. Just as a fair warning, a lot of their tacos are already spiced so don't go overboard with the seasoning afterwards!

And they don't fill up their tacos with veggies like the way a lot of other places too. Every time you take a bite, it's filled with meaty goodness, so no cheeping out on the protein here!

I don't recommend going in with a large group since there isn't much seating indoors, but if you're lucky, you'll be able to snag one of the tables by the window. Most people are content with eating their tacos standing up inside of the shop anyways so if you're too afraid to go back into the cold, it's perfectly acceptable to eat your taco there."}
{"text":"I have been told that Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos was the best tacos place in the city. It was good, but I do not think it was the best. These tacos were more like Canadian version tacos, I thought. They put many ingredients like Americans do. It was tasty, but it was different from tacos in Mexico."}
{"text":"Had the Baja and the Octopus. Just ok. I had high expectations based on reviews here. I thought Rubio's was much better. But alas, there isn't a rubio's here....yet."}
{"text":"Its a nice small place in Kensington market. The tacos have a really good reputation. 

I got the gobernador taco and it was exceptional. I would definitely recommend.

There is one veggie taco for those who don't eat meat.

The downside to this place is that its small. You really can't sit down and eat here for a while. You have to order and eat quickly. 

This would be a really cool place if it was larger/renovated. But you really can't turn down the food."}
{"text":"Best chicken tacos I've ever tried, they are super spicy even without the hot salsa. 

Only downside to this place is that they accept cash only"}
{"text":"There isn't a better Taco in the city. 

When these guys get it right (and out of about 40 visits they've only mildly disappointed twice) the taco is LIFE CHANGING. I mean it. It's so darn good, you can't believe you've never had it before. They treat their staff really well, they make UNBELIEVABLY good food, and they are cool about it all. I even had a soup here that was so good I had to buy a second bowl to eat the next day.

Honestly: YOU. NEED. TO. EAT. HERE. 

It's THE BEST TACO IN TORONTO by far, hands down, no contest. Everything else pales in comparison, and must bow down. 

Seriously, stop reading this review and go and eat something at 7 Lives."}
{"text":"Deserves the hype
Tips:
- Don't come with large group (small inside, not much seating)
- CASH ONLY
- Two tacos is enough, I got three and had to take it home"}
{"text":"Hopped in for s quick snack while we picked up groceries in Kensington market. Ordered fish tacos that were delicious. Limited seats so we had to stand but no biggie since we weren't there for long. Place is tiny and focus is likely take out. Lots of staff in the kitchen to keep things rolling. I would return and recommend you visit"}
{"text":"The joint itself is not very big, a few tables for standing and eating and one table to sit. If you have a place nearby, your best bet is probably to get take out! The menu is pretty simple and easy to read on the big chalk board right by where you order. After getting recommendations from a friend who claimed their tacos were the best in Toronto so far, we were pretty excited to give them a try!

Blackened mahi mahi taco -grilled with a dry rub of spices ($5). What a super tasty taco with the perfect amount of dry rub on the mahi mahi. There was a hint of sweetness in the taco that I couldn't quite place my finger on. 

Baja fish - battered deep fried mahi mahi with cream sauce ($5). This taco tasted like your classic fish taco. The batter was very light and the mahi mahi tasted very fresh.

Camarones a la diabla - spicy shrimp with cheese ($5).
The taco portions were very generous and quite big compared to some of the other taco places we've been to. One taco is the perfect snack size and two tacos will fill you up pretty quickly and make a great meal. A word of caution though, the tacos are pretty messy to eat with all the sauce and fillings. One bonus is that the taco has double tortilla so you won't have to worry about your taco ripping mid meal. 

If you have a taco craving and you are in the Kensington area, definitely stop by and pick up a taco or two! If you are feeling particularly hungry after, walk around and get a churro for dessert! There are so many Mexican restaurants in Kensington market now!"}
{"text":"Petit bouiboui hyper sympathique. Nous avons particulièrement aimé leur utilisation de la pieuvre."}
{"text":"I've been to Seven Lives a few times and each time the tacos are solid.  That said, I do have a few gripes with this restaurant: very little dining space, the wait for food can sometimes be very long, and $5 for one taco is pretty pricey.  

I have tried the baja fish, the gobernador and the pulpo en mole verde tacos - they're all delicious!  The baja fish is crispy, flakey and moist.  The gobernador is packed with a generous portion of flakey fish and sweet shrimp.  The pulpo is nice and chewy without being too gummy."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes, all the hype is TRUE. This is the best taco place in Toronto, maybe even Canada, maybe even the world."}
{"text":"My favorite taco joint in Toronto hands down. I love this place. You might even call it an obsession. I read the great reviews on Yelp and heard great things from friends so I finally tried it out a few months ago and I can't stop thinking about this place. I have been coming every other week at lunch and wish it could be more often. There is usually a line up out the door and this isn't a sit down kind of restaurant but I still love it. There is one communal picnic table and ledges for people to stand and eat as well as benched outside in front. The service is quick and friendly. The kitchen is in full view so it's interesting to sometimes to watch the action while you wait for your food to be ready. My favorite is the ceviche tostado and  all of the seafood tacos which is almost the whole menu. It's about $5-7 an item which may seem like a lot but it's totally worth it because they are so generous with the filling and everything is so fresh and tasty. If you like Mexican food and haven't tried this place out, you gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"Delicious tuna and prawn taco. Their hot sauce is extremely hot...loved it!"}
{"text":"Baja  fish tacos are filled with big pieces of fish.
prepare for long line ups on weekends"}
{"text":"YES. Get a Baja original fish taco. IT's the best! I go quite out of my way sometimes to get these babies. Crispy delicious freshness. DO IT!
The line  is long  . But it moves fast  
Well worth the wait .."}
{"text":"I get tacos from here every time I'm at Kensington market! Delicious tacos and great energy from the staff. My favourite is the grilled octopus taco - great texture and flavour.  

There's one small table for seating but mostly standing tables for you to eat. It's good for a quick snack or meal. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"A treat for all. Grab your cash and get over here (at a non-peak time). 

One doesn't get a medal for admitting they love tacos, but I love tacos. Seven Lives focuses primarily on fish/seafood tacos that burst at the seams. The restaurant itself bursts at the seams; it is very rare to see it without some sort of line, especially during the summertime. 

Recommendations? Spicy octopus taco for a hit of heat behind the meaty octopus texture, never overcooked. Shrimp or the famed Gobernator with shrimp and smoked tuna is always a good accompaniment. But truthfully, I always ask about the special of the day and end up coming away with that. Sometime it's a steelhead trout ceviche tostada, and other times it's a taco with wild salmon and specialty accoutrements. 

I find that the most enjoyable way to devour these is by ordering them to go and bringing them over to park off Augusta for some unparalleled people-watching. In the winter, it is tricky to find the same bliss, but the tacos are still worth a detour."}
{"text":"We're regulars here -- the Ceviche is always a winner, as is the Baja fish taco.  There's always a line up at lunch time on the weekends, and it's well deserved."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it's always consistently tasty! I usually don't like fish, but I always find myself here when in the mood for tacos. It's almost mesmerizing watching them make them with fresh ingredients!

My favourite is the Black Pepper Marlin, but you can't really go wrong with any choice. Don't forget to add salsa-- really adds a kick! A cup of their fresh juice can always counter the spice."}
{"text":"So for the longest time my idea of a taco was Old el Paso-- hard half moon shells that you buy from your local grocery store-- but no more. Since coming here I've been forever changed. The tacos are generously filled to the point where they use TWO tortillas. When it comes to portion size especially with someone whose eyes are bigger than her stomach, the number 1 usually does not apply to food, but believe me when I say 1 is goooooooood enough. Go for two and your mouth will be happy as the flavours hug the shores of your mouth, but your stomach-- well you'll find out. 

You can't go wrong with 5 bucks a pop (as in tacos not soda, just so we're clear) which is another guilt free reason why you should, would or, could get 2. 

I have yet to return once more and try the rest of the menu and their beverages. So far my mouth has gone for the Gobernador (its easier to spell than pronounce) and the Octopus (not my fav but good). 

Will definitely be back fo shoooooo."}
{"text":"Fantastic mushroom and cactus tacos. It's a summer treat! 

Last time I ordered, it was a little too oily, but it won't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly service. Not an eat-in place. There is one table and a stand up bar around the perimeter."}
{"text":"Best taco in Toronto.  Always a line.  The fresh juice is always great.  Must try the octopus taco."}
{"text":"Shrimp and Baja fish tacos were delightful. To die for. Like you would fight your grandpa over the last one. So delicious that it didn't matter that there were barely any surfaces to place your tacos on (very limited seating but quaint). I'd just stand there with the taco in my hands while the spicy sauce dripped down my face, devouring it like a person who hadn't seen food in lifetimes. It was that good.

I travel 1 hour + 45 minutes on bus, subway, and streetcar just to eat this once a week. I come from a faraway land of Taco Bells and Tim Hortons. I pledge allegiance to Seven Lives!"}
{"text":"A must try in Toronto!! I'm not sure how authentic they are, but the tacos are delicious. The price is on the higher side but they are super filling so you don't need more than two unless you have a major appetite. The tortilla chips are unbelievable and you get a huge bag! Service is good but the tiny shop can be a little overwhelming."}
{"text":"Had the best tacos I've had in Toronto here. I highly recommend El Gobernador which is their top selling taco. One thing to note is there isn't many seating areas so make sure to snatch a seat as soon as you walk through the door."}
{"text":"The best taco I have had. Long wait though.

Only one vegetarian option, would have liked to have more vegetarian options."}
{"text":"So yummy!! Super fresh and flavorful! I live in the New York area and this is SOO MUCH BETTER than any mexican food I have had in the U.S so far. 

My favorites were the Baja Fish taco and Ceviche tostada. The Baja Fish was coated with the perfect amount of batter which was fried to a golden crispy shell while the fish inside was dense and meaty. It was an extremely satisfying taco. Ceviche tostada was an explosion of flavors. The seafood was tart, sweet and spicy whereas the guacamole underneath was creamy and mellow.  The two provided a nice contrast. I will come back to try more! I highly recommend this place!

However, it's wise to plan ahead if you don't want to wait. I would come on a weekday and avoid the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Came here 8 minutes after they opened and not only was there a massive crowd, but they didn't have a single vegetarian option and were sold out of many of their options. Was visiting from Chicago and paid to park to try this top rated spot and was super disappointed."}
{"text":"New favourite taco spot! Mmmm! Tried the carnitas (pork & pork belly) as well as blackened mahi mahi.  Both were super tasty!  Great portion sizes and prices.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Seven Lives is hands-down the best taco place I have tried. 
5 stars for quality, taste, portion and price.

All of the other taco options around the area (La Carnita, El Trompo, Mexican Salsas, Rebozos, etc.) do not even COMPARE to Seven Lives. The portions at the other places are smaller and either cost the same or more even though you get less. (They're also not as tasty.) What would fill you up with 4-5 tacos at other places would fill you up with 2-3 tacos at Seven Lives.

My favourite is the baja fish taco and the ceviche. (Although the deep fried shrimp, carnitas, blackened mahi mahi and everything else I tried was really good as well) I really like how the fish is fresh, flavourful and not overcooked. They also double-shell the tacos which keep everything from falling apart (since they stuff them pretty full).

This is not a fancy place, it is very small and it doesn't have a lot of seating; however, the quality of the food speaks for itself.

They close at 8pm and run out of certain tacos sometimes so go early!"}
{"text":"Super tiny place with one table and some standing area. No washroom and they don't take debit/credit. They also close at 7pm not 8pm! 

Between 2 people, we had 2 octopus tacos, 1 carnita taco and poke n chips. We were very hungry in the beginning and we were super full! They give generous amount of octopus for each taco. Poke n chips were really good but could have more poke for the price.

As you can tell from the photos, if you are looking for some authentic tacos that you can get from the local Mexican restaurants, this is not the place."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are to die for! The Crema sauce that they are served with....wow. This is a great place for quick take-out. The tacos are huge and priced around $5-$6. It gets super super busy though and is really small so it can get a bit hectic inside. All part of the experience!"}
{"text":"1: Poor
2: OK
3: Good
4: Very Good
5: Excellent

Baja Fish Taco 4.5/5.  

Blackened Mahi Mahi Taco 4/5.  

Tasty. Pricey."}
{"text":"The goodness here is real. 

It was first taco experience for me after hearing of hype. 
Flavour, portion, and price were good.

Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty amazing. Had two different tacos, as it was a Sunday afternoon and I was still feeling my Saturday night, but man, were they ever delicious! 
So much so I wish I was able to eat more - but that would have been a bad idea.
If you're ever headed to Kensington Market, come on an empty, and settled stomach."}
{"text":"absolutely the best Mexican style ceviche in the city and worth the inevitable line ups. The tacos are great too but I can't NOT order the ceviche so I almost never get a taco. We come here pretty much every weekend and try to get there right before they open up so we don't have to wait too long
a true Kensington Market gem!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about Seven Lives.

It is handily my favorite taco joint in the City, and for good reason. 

The portions as massive, the homemade salsas are great, and the tacos are fresh and delicious. 

The marlin taco is absolutely amazing and will have you questioning whether or not you're eating meat, the shrimp taco is cooked perfectly and the sauce is delicious, but nothing tops their carnitas.

Unfortunately, they often do sell out of carnitas early (before 5:00PM), so get there around lunch if you want to try them! I've been lucky enough to get them once, and it may have been the best taco I've ever had.

Also, they make a great homemade lemonade, so I also recommend grabbing a glass of that.

You should also note that there is not much seating in the restaurant, so be prepared to eat while standing or taking it to go."}
{"text":"One of the best things I ate while visiting Toronto. The line was a bit long, probably took me about 20 mins to order and get my food but it was pretty good. 

The spicy shrimp and cheese is a must order. It's simple, but pretty unique and I haven't really had a taco like that elsewhere. My friend ordered another taco, I forgot what it was, but it was really good too. Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"This review is for the owner so I hope you read it.

Your food is good.

Your customer service is somewhere under the table. 

In a word: TERRIBLE. 

I do not care if you are from California and have tried Tijuana tacos. Man does not matter. Even in Mexico the taqueros in the street are way nicer and do not make a scandal for a lost taco. 

Plus you do not even cook the carnitas the proper way. I tasted them.

 You almost kicked me out pushing me because your staff can not even hand the right orders. Plus your girl there was trying to make me pay for an order that was not mine. 

P.S The place smells like toilet, the one downstairs that is not even available for clients. 

Well this is what happens when hipsters try to sell good food.

Cheers."}
{"text":"My roommate hooked me on this place a few months ago, and it's become our Saturday afternoon tradition to come and buy a couple to either drip all over ourselves at a nearby park or slurp back along the crowded counter inside. THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. We are taco fiends and so far this little shop still holds the title for both of us. My absolute favourite is the octopus, but so far there hasn't been a single one that I would label \"meh\", and at 4-8 bucks a pop, you can't really go wrong. This is not a sit-down establishment, and you should prepare for a line at all hours of the day, but it's very worth it."}
{"text":"Hands down! This place deserves great rating. Great tacos. This little taco shop inside of Kensington market is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after all the hype I have heard about it. Verdict: it's pretty good but imo it's overpriced. I had read reviews saying that the servings are stuffy so I was thinking for $6 a pop I would get a lot for the price, but when I received my tacos, they were tiny. I got the gobernador ( yummy), spicy shrimp (good) and baja fish (good). I mean they were all pretty good but not crazy crazy good to go across town for. And yea once again, for $6 I think the servings should be a tad bigger."}
{"text":"By far the best tacos I have ever eaten. My fiancée is the one who actually introduced me to this little heavenly place in the Kensington Market. If your craving a taco, you need to head to Seven Lives! Trust me, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Best seafood tacos in toronto! It is super tiny and they have no place to dine in and the food doesnt travel well. There is always a line up. Always.
 If you live in the neighbourhood,  have a car to eat in, or want to enjoy this food picnic style, it is the best flavours you can imagine. We love the ceviche and the Gobernator tacos best."}

Rating: (10/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (10/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness

My Experience:  

Hands down my favourite taco place in Toronto. $5 for a big serving of delicious and fresh tacos. I've been eating with them since their early days as a food festival vendor at TUM, to their first, smaller location in Kensington. After all this time, they finally found their rightful spot and lay claim to the throne of Taco supremacy. 

Every taco has been a hit for me, but Gorbernador is their staple dish, but I always try out their daily specials, which are always in rotation. Baja fish and Mahi Mahi are great choices as well. There are also a varying amount of hot sauces available, with hot being quite spicy.  

There isn't too much seating at the location, so weekends can get pretty busy. There's a small table and some standing tables. Also note that there are no washrooms available for customers. They also only accept cash, so come prepared. 

I've enjoyed tacos throughout the city, from the smallest joint to the fanciest spot. Although the others are good, hands down, Seven Lives is the best of the best."}
{"text":"Tacos are out of this world. Drove from Pickering to try it and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The octopus taco is the best! I love how they pack it with filling and normally don't skimp out :) Lots of flavour packed into these snacks."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I Tried the Mahi Mahi, the salmon and shrimp, and the pork and they were all great! Make sure you bring cash and be prepared to stand because it's a small place. No complaints here though!!"}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos were good.  Fish tacos had too much sauce and batter, fish was mushy, and tasteless.  Cuilacolche has way too much corn and was soggy.

On top of that service was meh, the staff was not friendly, there was nowhere to sit and the stand up tables were dirty.  It wasn't really even busy."}
{"text":"They feature seafood tacos. The size is pretty big. 2 is sufficient for a meal. I had the shrimp and grilled octopus tacos. Both are delicious."}
{"text":"Drools......
How I am drooling for a taco from seven lives right now.

Worth the wait, worth the squishy environment - so worth it!

They are as quick as they can get when it comes to service - after all they are serving tacos with fresh ingredients.

Amazing hot sauces from mild to spicy! Loved them all. 

Flavours are so on point, my two favourites were the carnita and the Baja tacos! But we tried all of them and they were all good, two tacos is good enough for a meal, and super cheap for the amount these guys stuff these babies! 


Cant wait to return."}
{"text":"Authentic, fresh, and lively little taco shop in Kensington Market! 
We ordered the blackened mahi mahi and baja fish. While the baja fish tacos were scrumptious, juicy nuggets of flavor, the mahi mahi was a little...off. It was WAY too salty and overseasoned that we didn't care to finish it. 

The interior is a colorful, lively atmosphere, but it gets cramped very quickly with little to no room to move. Service was fast and friendly, though."}
{"text":"Fish tacos done right!... although the restaurant is very, very small (just one 6-seats table, and some standing room), you have to go at least once and try the tacos here. They really fill them up with fish, shrimp, octopus, or whatever you have ordered... they are cooked as they are ordered, so you are guaranteed to have a fresh taco in front of you every time. In summer you can ask for take out, and then find a park nearby in Kensington Market to enjoy the food at your own leisure. I love to come back and try different things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Toronto hands down. The ceviche is also solid. Be prepared for line-ups."}
{"text":"I come here a lot now. Best tacos in the city. It's almost always super busy, but service is great and quick. Cash only! You can't go wrong, but carnitas, Baja fish and mahi mahi are excellent!"}
{"text":"Ive been wanting to come here because of the high reviews, I have tried the Baja fish, chicken and shrimp tacos. I tasted it  and I felt that there was nothing special about the taste,  I have tasted better tacos than this.  Maybe my expectations  were too high for this taco place."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the city by far. Tasty, fresh and fast. Menu changes a lot which makes for an adventure every time!"}
{"text":"Best taco place in town!!!!Best taco place in town!!!!Best taco place in town!!!!
Important staff must repeat 3 times."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. If you go you must have the gobinator. Portions are very fair , I only had two and was full. Only downfall is the limited amount of seating - only one table to sit down at, because of this I wouldn't recommend to groups wishing to have a dinner out together. The tacos are all $5 each and they only take cash."}
{"text":"For first timers to Seven Lives Tacos, this is what to expect to ensure a better eating experience:
* Expect line ups on weekends unless you come on week day around 4pm.
* Some items may be sold out later in the day
* Limited seating. Stand inside eating or stand/sit outside eating. Expect overcrowding during busy times. Many Kensington Market eateries are like this.
* Cash only so bring $$$$. No special orders.
* No washroom. Go before you go there.
* Two tacos and a drink is enough for a meal
* Get napkins and wet-naps to clean messy hands
* Sample mild, medium and hot sauces before putting on tacos. Hot sauce is not for the weak. It's for those who can handle Armageddon Sauce at Duff's Chicken Wings. It will burn out your stomach lol. You have been warned!

Hopefully, you will enjoy your tacos more after being informed of the above.

I ordered the Poke 'N Chips and the Gobernator Taco. To drink, I had a bottle of Jarritos Strawberry Soda. The Poke 'N Chips, consisting of Hawaiian poke raw fish served on nacho chips, was a tasty dish combining the 2 popular dishes. It was not salty. Same for the Gobernator.The Mexican soda had natural strawberry flavouring and was a good change from all the local soft drinks I have been drinking.

Previously, I had the Blackened Mahi Mahi and the Grilled Octopus Tacos. I enjoyed both tacos. They were not too salty as other reviewers may have said. The octopus was not chewy. The lemonade, made in house, was refreshing and not too sweet.

I plan on trying the other tacos on the menu."}
{"text":"Great shrimp tacos. Quite messy, and very crowded but worth it for the flavors from the sauce and meat and seasoning inside the taco. Easy and cheap bite to grab."}
{"text":"OMG! This place has the best tacos!

Mr. H and I went here after having read some pretty great reviews and we were not disappointed. We reached there on a saturday afternoon and here was already a line but that only made me more excited. They have a daily fresh juice which was honey dew melon on the day i went and it was superb. I definitely recommend people trying it. Between the two of us we ordered 5 tacos, the gorbonador (don't think the spelling is right, but the taste sure was), the spicy shrimp (this was soooo good!), the mahi mahi (good but a bit too much sour cream, it diluted the flavours), the daily catch which on that day was a swordfish special (yum!) and the carnitas (good). 

They have three salsas on the table to chose from, hot, medium and mild. Be careful, the hot is very hot! (I'm an Indian and I'm saying that!) But I still loved the hot and medium salsa, it tasted very different. Keep in mind they don't have a large seating area and it's cash only. We had to stand at the counter and eat our food, next time I'll just get it to go and walk it to the park near by and eat. However, I did find the place to be a bit pricy, it was $32 for 5 tacos and 2 drinks. $5 a taco is not that cheap and if I were very hungry I might have wanted more than 2, which means I would have spent $15 without drinks and tax. I wish they would rework the pricing.

I will definitely be coming back but not as often and I would like to due to the price."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Seven lives on a Thursday afternoon. The line was fairly short, and out food was made quite promptly. The price was reasonable, but I only realized after I got my taco that I was not given back correct change by a few dollars and (partially my fault to be fair as I did not check) I did not want to hassle the cash counter. The tacos themselves were good, I got the gobernator and it was very flavourful. My friend got the pork carnitas, but I found that the meat was too dry for my liking. Both the tacos were good but did not stand out to me.That being said I will definitely come to try the other tacos."}
{"text":"Location: It's in Kensington market, accessible by streetcar or walking, and is surrounded by many different restaurants (in case you get there at like 12:01 and don't wanna wait 15 minutes in line to order)

Price: All tacos are around $5 or $6, depending on fanciness level. 

Food: The tacos are delicious! They're fully stuffed with veggies, guacamole, etc. and held together by 2 tortillas. The meat is very tasty, especially the carnitas. The baja fish is quite good, except it's pretty oily and can't compare to Bareo Coreano or Playa Cabana. 

Seating: The line is very long, and there's only 5 seats. So either come early or take it to go... Or stand ominously over people who are sitting until they leave. 

Overall: Good value delicious tacos with a long line. Best time to come is around 11:55am, 5 minutes before they open."}
{"text":"Omgg I had no idea fish tacos could be this good. The Gobernator was really good, and the blackened Mahi-Mahi was outstanding. I seriously hope they open more."}
{"text":"I had the gobernador taco, and it was great! I put some of the mild sauce, it was spicy in a good way (I'm not that used to spicy food). I can't wait to try the other tacos!"}
{"text":"I visited them on Friday after reading rave reviews and it still blew my mind. 

The place is not a proper dine-in restaurant. It has one table that may accommodate 4-6 hungry and salivating beasts (don't believe me..go see yourself turning into one by the time you get your hands on your order). Others may either have to stand up at another corner or they have to out an eat.

The line was starting out the door on Friday evening. The menu is simple. They have 6-7 different Tacos. 5$ each. 

I absolutely adored blackened mahi mahi taco. It was grilled without any batter just with the spices and and it grilled well. It was served with avocado sauce and pico di gallo. The dry rub really helped with the flavor.

The baja fish taco was nice too. It was hot and crunchy. But i felt that it was a little bland (personal quirk; nothing wrong with the dish). The sauces added on the top don't make up for the lost flavor in my opinion.

The food was highlight of the great weekend I had.


Are you still reading, lazy fellow? I thought you would already be on your way."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm hooked! The price is reasonable, and I enjoyed the fish taco. My only hesitation is that there is limited seating, so I had to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"The tacos here are very tasty - I love the baja fish taco the best. Go for lunch or a snack, and then walk around Kensington market. The only downside is I wish there were more tables and chairs."}
{"text":"Tasty tacos but not worth the price or the line-up. They charge $6 for a pretty small taco."}
{"text":"I support the hype! Super impressed by everything at this hole in the wall joint! 
- great price for the huge portions and generous seafood and meat in every taco ($5 per taco but they are pretty filling and definitely gourmet) 
- REALLY delicious corn tortillas! They doubled the tortillas on each taco so it holds together nicely without being too carby since they're very tender tortillas. 
- careful, the hot sauce is really hot! 
- Baja fish tacos were piping hot and crispy, with generous filet size! Freshly battered and fried to order 
- also really enjoyed the octopus and super flavourful smoked tuna and shrimp taco 

Authentic flavour and delicious! Too bad you can't sit and have a beer - it's truly designed to grab and go, or stand and eat."}
{"text":"When more then half your friends on yelp give this place 5 stars, you have to put this as a priority! It did not disappoint. The tacos I had were probably the best tacos I have tried in the city. Add the hottest sauce to take it to the next level. Star of the show was the pork shoulder taco. Keep it up! 

Note: cash only and don't forget to tip!"}
{"text":"Divine is the only word I can say that describes Seven Lives. So delicious. Went this afternoon it was packed, luckily got the seats near the window and ordered 4 tacos:
Blackened Mahi Mahi
Spicy Shrimp
Gorbonator 
Special of the day - Swordfish 

All were delicious and I kind of overdid it with the hot salsa (my mouth was burning by the end of my meal). Unfortunately they were out of the fresh juices (today was cantaloupe) and the cashier said they just ran out of 40 litres of it!! 

Anyway all in all, great great food. I will come again :)"}
{"text":"After all of the hype it was just ok. I was pretty disappointed. The fish was good but the pastor was gross. Long lineups. I wish we'd gone to Rasta Pasta next door instead."}
{"text":"This place was long overdue to visit and I am glad, I finally made it! 
The tacos are the best I've had in Toronto, reminded me of Mexico! So fresh, so delicious! 
Can't wait to visit again"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and ordered 2 tacos -- the blackened mahi mahi and the baja fish taco.  Both were outstanding, and I enjoyed how you can dress your own tacos with mild, medium, or hot salsa, and lime.  I would break down the restaurant like so:

taste: 10/10 (probably the best fish tacos I've ever had)
environment: 6/10 (a little crowded)
price: 7/10 ($10 for 2 tacos)

The above numbers average out to 4/5 stars, but because Yelp stars are generally inflated and the fish tacos were the best I've ever had, I'm giving this place a 5."}
{"text":"The tacos - MUY BIEN! Excited to return here to try the other tacos on the menu. 

I ordered the Gobernador (smoked marlin, shrimp, and cheese) and it was delicious - packed with so much flavour! I added both the medium and mild salsa and a touch of lime, which I highly recommend to elevate the taco. 

Not only was the food delicious, but the service is amazing and the staff are really fun (They saw me taking a photo and they all smiled for a photo!). This restaurant is definitely more of a take-out restaurant, with very little seating. They have two benches inside and two outside. There is also typically a line out the door, BUT it does move quick, so it's worth the wait! 

Tip: The tacos are very messy, so get the napkins and wet wipes they provide near the forks and salsa."}
{"text":"This spot used to be amazing back in the day now it's just good new management higher prices lower quality there's a lady with jet black hair a bit gothy looking usually works cash ... She knows how to make you feel unwelcome with very little words and that's a skill"}
{"text":"I've been to Seven Lives a couple of times now, and lets just say if I know I'm going to get Seven Lives Tacos at the end of a week, I cannot contain my excitement for the entire week! It's THAT GOOD!!

I've had the Blackened Mahi Mahi, Baja Fish and Cod. I've been wanting to try Carnita but it's always sold out! But that's ok, more excuse for me to come back again. :)

Hands down the best tacos in Toronto!! And unlike other reviewers that say it's all hype.. not at all! The amount of filling and flavour you get per taco is so immense that they have to double tortilla the taco. And don't even get me started on their hottest hot sauce. That combine with the flavours of the tacos.. HEAVEN!! I hope they remain this good forever!!"}
{"text":"Have tried tacos all over the city in the past two years. No where beats the flavour, quality and amount of ingreds in the taco. By far my fav. Spicy shrimp...amazing. 
Would love if they had more seats!"}
{"text":"good service. a good meal and great value we will certainly be going back."}
{"text":"Spectacular tacos.

The Gobernador (\"Gober\" for short) mixes tender, juicy shrimp with some strongly-flavored smoked tuna.  First on the menu, should be first on your order.

I also tried the pulpo (octopus was a little chewy as expected, but tasty) and baja fish (battered and fried, tasty but a little heavy).

Lots of an especially good taco white sauce (sour cream-maya-lime-whatever) here.

Friendly place, figure on standing at the rail as there's only one table.  There's often a line, but it moves."}
{"text":"Was so full but had to come here for one taco because of the amazing reviews, and I'm glad I did!!! I got a barbacoa taco and boy was it delicious. The shrimp in it was probably the best tasting shrimp I have ever had. Not even a big Mexican food fan but I will surely be coming back here when I am in Toronto next, and hopefully with a bigger appetite!"}
{"text":"Me and my friends loved the tacos. However several hours later we all got food poisoning. I'm pregnant and it's not good for my baby. I'm in so much pain right now. The tacos were good not so sure about the cleanliness/ food hygiene of the restaurant. Cannot put myself through this again so will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Good tacos, QPR and friendly service at the counter. Fave taco was the shrimp and cheese one. Repeat: Perhaps"}
{"text":"had to try because of the glowing reviews on yelp. First of, 214 Augusta was a bit of a pain to find. This address isn't solely theirs, they share it with a Jamaican food stall, and a churro store. It's a brilliant idea actually if you want to try out a business.

I tried the gobernador and mahi mahi. Definitely interesting, definitely good. I was expecting a much bigger flavor explosion because the taco itself was packed with a variety of ingredients but wasn't the case. A bit of a mess to eat but overall it was alright."}
{"text":"The Gobernador is amazing!!! Really loved it! Their house sauce is to die for.
I also ordered the baja fish which unfortunately came out a bit dry but still good.
Be aware - not a lot of seating available. Most people do take out. Make sure you grab lots of napkins, it's definitely a messy eat."}
{"text":"This is an incredibly small but extremely busy restaurant; expect to wait around 15 minutes but it is definitely worth the wait. The baha fish tacos were delicious and the strawberry lemonade was very tasty. I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my Gob! LEGIT best tacos everrrrrrr. 
What an amazing foodie meal, to start 2016 with. 

In light of 'semi-healthy' New Years resolutions, we narrowed down to 4; Gobernador, Camarones a la Diabla (Spicy Shrimp), Blackened Mahi Mahi, and Baja fish. Every single one of these were amaaaaaazing. 
Jam packed with flavour and relatively cheap. 

3 free salsas; mild, medium and hot. If you're a fiend for (really) spicy, you'll love the hot. 

Definitely recommend the Gobernator and the spicy shrimp! These two are going to keep me coming back!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Toronto, hands down.  There is a long wait, no seating at all, and it's still worth it."}
{"text":"i think if you came from soCAL, this would not be such a big deal but we are in toronoto and a pretty trendy part of toronoto. so expect good food to be more expensive *overall, the east coast is more expensive on food!* tacos are $6 but are really filling. 

regrettably, i did not order the gobernador taco which is their signature. instead, i opted for the carnitas and beef tongue. really delicious and on par with la - fresh handmade tortillas and made to order meat. it comes warm, and bold, and tender meat. 

there is a line even at off peak hours, but it moves fairly quickly. do come in for a bite if you're missing your mexican food mix.

No real seating area... and CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"just tried their ceviche many times and loved it each time i managed to get some as many time, there were sold out when i went"}
{"text":"Holy macaroni!! These were the best tacos I have ever had. I got the carnitas and the gobernador. It came up to $14 for the two including tax. Two tacos were the perfect amount. The wait wasn't too long considering there was a line inside the store. The inside is really small, so expect to eat and then leave right away or take them to go. They really do stuff the tacos but there's enough of the shell to keep all of it together. I definitely will come back for more and to try the rest of the flavours!!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best tacos in downtown Toronto at a reasonable price.

Ordered the shrimp, octopus as well as the baja fish tacos, and they were all delicious and served promptly. The receptionist was friendly, and helpful.

The only qualm I have about this place is that there are not many seats available, hence some people might have to resort to standing, which is bearable but not the best.

Also, it is CASH ONLY, so please be prepared when visiting."}
{"text":"Great tacos! Very good price and great amount of food.

Only downside is if there was a bit more space to sit down.

Its the best taco shop you can probably get in Toronto at a price of ~5 dollars a taco."}
{"text":"***CASH ONLY***
Tiny restaurant with very limited amount of seats/standing area but definitely worth the hassle! 

They have amazing tacos - very flavourful, freshly made/fried, lots of veggies on it and beautifully presented for ~$5 each. I usually order the Baja fish, blackened mahi mahi, shrimp tacos. Their ceviche is also amazing - sits on top of a tostado shell but eat it quick because it does it soggy.

People there are super friendly. Overall, I really enjoy this place and I'm coming back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Down right delicious tacos. Would especially recommend the spicy shrimp and cheese!! I came with my girlfriend, she ordered it and I had the carnitas.  The carnitas taco was really good too, but I took one bite of my girlfriends seafood snatch and I was ready to propose."}
{"text":"My favourite taco place. Moderately priced tacos, last time I went it was 5$ plus tax.  So delicious. The Baja fish taco is amazinggg. I always recommend this place. It's a cute little place too, not a lot of places to sit, but you can stand off to the side or eat it outside, as many do. Make sure to grab a bunch of napkins and a fork because it can be messy."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in 5 months, looking forward to hundreds more. Excellent tacos! Everything is awesome!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummyyyyy. I got the Baja fish tacos and my bf got the spicy shrimp... We meant to share but we loved our own so much we gobbled it up without making a switch...

The Baja fish and tacos comes with two pieces of fish. It seemed small but turned out to be very filling! I can't speak about the spicy shrimp only that it smelt delicious, like I said my bf didn't share! :( 

Looking forward to going again!"}
{"text":"This place has changed management over the year and the new menu is horrible. They are right now riding on the success of their previous menu!

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! 

I am very sad to see their menu and food go down the drain!"}
{"text":"Me and my GF visited Toronto during our trip to Niagara and being the foodies we are we had to visit Kensington Market. Seven Lives might be the best place to get food in that area. Now Seven Lives menu can be a bit strange but if you get nothing else make sure you get their chicken taco. By far the best taco I've had, the seasoning they use on their chicken is A+. It was so good that we ended up stopping by 1 more time before leaving Toronto that day. It can be extremely busy in their so order and move to the side. Do not be deterred by a long line. It is worth the wait !"}
{"text":"I'm no expert on Latin cuisine, but this felt authentic.
I was feeling peckish in Kensington and stopped in for a quick taco. 
The cactus and mushroom taco with grilled cheese caught my eye. I've never eaten cactus before (as far as I know) and it was the only option without fish or meat. When I got my one taco order, which came quite quickly, I was excited to see it smothered in guacamole and salsa. The cactus was cooked down to a nice soft texture and combined with sauteed onions, mushrooms and jalapenos that gave it a pleasant kick. The biggest surprise for me was the grilled cheese. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the grilled slab of salty chewy half melted cheese was absolutely delicious and was an exquisite counterbalance to the spice of the meal. 
The taco was messy which made it both a fun and challenging dish. I ended up attacking it with two forks in order to tear up the grilled cheese and the taco shell (which had a nice corn flavour). It was a nice small restaurant, and I would come back to try their other tacos in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Kensington Market. I can see why they claim this as the best place for tacos in the area. My friend from Barrie was gracious enough to bring me on a tour here. I hope to bring my daughters back here!"}
{"text":"More tacos please! My favorite stop in Kensington Market.  Absolutely the best tacos in Toronto. Fresh, delicious, made to order food. Sure, there's no seating, and there's a (fast moving) line-up, but biting into the tacos here reminds me of growing up in Southern California. Increíble!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! Great price too, $5 each which is a steal for such great quality food. Make sure to bring cash as they don't take card although if yu forget there is an ATM right across the street. Downside is minimal seating and it's usually packed if you go at lunch time, but definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Their tortilla chips have a fresh, spicy twist to them and are fantastic. Their pork taco is a bit greasy but delicious. The chicken was great and I look forward to trying the fried fish. I tried the beef cheek and head meat and it was more like head cheese/jello than I had hoped so pass, but if you're into that, you might love it. Fast, fun, small menu with a great vibe of loving what their doing."}
{"text":"AMAZING TACOS!! I could eat these everyday and never get tired of them. Many options for spicy and mild. I see why this place was recommended in every Toronto blog. Very small restaurant but they get everyone in and out fast. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"excellent portions for the price, in comparison to many of the other establishments that have hopped onto the taco wagon (mm...taco wagon). double layer corn tortillas and mounds of filling that you can barely wrap up. octopus in the PULPO is tender. the GOBERNATOR is shrimp and smoked tuna and a real party in your mouth in both texture and flavours. the smoked tuna super closely resembles pulled pork -- trippy!

definitely go on a nice day so that after you squeeeeze your way in and squeeeeze your way out, you can enjoy your tacos in the park and watch some dope Frisbee gurus show you how it's done.

solid tacos here; looking forward to trying out the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Got Camarones a la Diabla--which was appropriately spicy (a rarity)! I haven't had enough homemade tacos in my life to have a relevant opinion on Seven Lives, but let me tell you eating that entire damn taco was a religious experience and I would have happily devoured more had my mouth not felt like it was on fire."}
{"text":"I went back recently and it wasn't as good as I remembered. Tacos seemed just a little bit dry and less flavourful than last time. Still really good though, but no longer mindblowing."}
{"text":"I'm not a big seafood eater so I got a carnitas taco from this joint and it was one of the finest tacos I had ever enjoyed.  I usually prefer my tacos to be fairly simple with just whichever filling you want with a bit of onion, cliantro, and salsa.   These loaded tacos however hit the spot amazingly well and are bursting with incredible freshness and big-time flavour (even though it wasn't really all that heavily spiced).  If they ever opened up a bigger venue with more seating, I would drop by even more often.  But when the weather is nice and you want to eat on the go, this is one of the finest places around in Toronto."}
{"text":"Insane line ups for tacos, gets really crowded for lunch no matter which day of the week you come at. If you're looking for a quick snack that isn't McD their Baja or beef taco is great at $6 a piece. For a more filling option expect to get at least two tacos. 

Much more bearable to go to them on a pedestrian Sunday. They seem to move faster."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I have ever had! The Baja fish taco was outstanding and a must if you eat here, the fish was incredibly fresh and the slaw on top just added to the intense flavor. The space is small so make sure you get here early."}
{"text":"I literally am drooling before I get inside this place, the tacos are amazing and it's usually pretty busy here. You'd think it's a little pricey but once you see what you get and you devour your tacos, you will not regret it. It's a tight place and I wish it was able to expand for more seating but overall this place is the bomb to go for tacos! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"2.5 STARS
I came here well after the lunch rush & there were only 2 people in line ahead of me. Placed my order with the cashier & waited patiently. I've heard during peak periods you could be waiting up to 30 minutes easy for your order. Luckily my Baja fish taco was ready in 5 minutes. 

The haddock fish was hot, crispy plus the pico de gallo & cabbage slaw on top added flavour & juiciness to every bite. They also have homemade hot sauces (mild, medium & hot) on the counter for your pleasure. For me adding both the mild & medium is perfect since the mild is too mild on its own. Even though everything tasted delicious, it's certainly not entirely authentic more Mexican inspired.  

Is it worth your time & money? Debatable but it's a nice light snack if you need to eat and run."}
{"text":"It's awesome. I love it. I come here regularly.

My favourite is the octopus and a seafood ceviche but they try to be known for the Gorbernator.  They had it printed on a front window \"Home of the Gorbernator\" and some people think that's the name of the place. I don't recommend it because it has tuna (high mercury, recommend by health officials not to be consumed by women who are pregnant or who may ever BECOME pregnant) and is smoked (carcinogenic).

The fresh homemade juices are generally lovely.

Drawbacks: frequently, there are long lines and, always, there is minimal seating.

A prediction: 7 Lives becomes a franchise or opens more locations."}
{"text":"Really good fish tacos. The Marlin and the Mahi Mahi were a little spicy but good. The Baha was great and I loved the Hibiscus tea.
The lines are insanely long! But the staff is very nice :)"}
{"text":"The salsa here is great and flavorful, and the lineup is always long...

Food? It's fish tacos are subpar at best. They were dry and not juicy. The fish all seemed to be overcooked. Good fish taco needs to preserve the fat and juice of the fish so that it will give you that rich mouthfeel. Also, without the salsa that you can put on top, the tacos were kind of boring. 

I can't judge the non-fish tacos since I didn't try them. But I did try all their fish ones. I think fish tacos are trickier to perfect than the meat ones. It's easy to make meats taste good. Also maybe I have been spoiled by the emerging Mexican food scene in Philly and the Mexican food in CA.

Overall, I think this place is overhyped. But, hey, taste is subjective so try it for yourself before coming to a conclusion."}
{"text":"This is a must-go place if you are around the Kensington Market area!
Everytime i go to Kensington market i must eat there.
They have really tastey tacos and at a really good price !!
Each taco is about $5 and these tacos are big!! You can get full just eating two of them.
I always get the Baja fish taco and the Gobernador taco,their tacos are very fresh.
Sometimes they would have the tamarind soda which is so hard to find elsewhere! 

The line up could get a bit long at times though so just be prepared to wait in line. 
The store also only has 1 table so you would most likely have to stand and eat or take out."}
{"text":"Was considering writing a long and fantastical review, considering I don't often give out 5 stars, but it is not necessary.

If you're considering eating here, eat here. It's that simple. Amazing food.

Was my first time and I had the Gobernador and the Baja Fish."}
{"text":"So going to go against the grain here somewhat and say that this place is less then stellar. Heard a lot of hype about this place and was actually very disappointed. Ordered both the Baja and Pork tacos and on a chilly Monday afternoon in February. Okay so the place is small but charming. Has a nice vibe and the service was friendly however one can not make it on good service alone. Not even close to a taco you'd find in California. As a result is my findings;

Pros:
*Quaint and hip joint in Kensington Market
*Good service
*Very affordable prices considering the quantity of the taco was plenty
*The pork tacos were fairly decent
*No lineup as reported by others but might have something to do with the fact that I went at 3:30 in the afternoon
*Fast service, didn't wait too long

Cons:
*Bland taco shells, greasy and tasteless baja fish
*Again the fish tacos were a major disappointment as they were deep fried which is a Huge no-no, talk about artery clogging goop
*Tacos are were quite messy and were way overloaded with dripping sauce
*Cilantro mix/sauce was bland
*No parking!
*Cash only"}
{"text":"Tacos are wondering and filling. The Camarones taco is no joke, it definitely is spicy (or maybe I just have very low tolerance). Thank goodness for the free water. Very tasty and the shrimp are plump and juicy. The Baja is like a fish and chip type of taco, can't go wrong with fried fish! They give you a huge fillet as well. The Gobernador with seared tuna, shrimp and cheese was definitely messy. I was imagining Japanese style seared ahi tuna..but the tuna was in small shredded pieces so they fell all over the place. 
It is excellent comfort food and you can expect to get your hands dirty!
The watermelon juice was refreshing. 

Seating is limited. Two small tables and 3 countertops for maybe 3 people each. Twice I've been here, and twice I've been able to score the countertop...overlying the garbage bins. So maybe strategically wait and grab a spot before ordering."}
{"text":"Best darn tacos I've had in Canada, hands down."}
{"text":"Small portions but it's a $5 taco so this is standard size. I got the Baja fish, which was alright. Sort of plain personally. I also got the shrimp taco, which I really enjoyed. I normally don't like seafood but I'd definitely get the shrimp taco again. 

I was feeling adventurous so I tried all 3 sauces they provided (mild, medium, and hot). Mild was a good spicy, medium was tolerable hot spicy, and hot was killer. I literally started crying and had to ask for water 

Honestly even medium sauce was pretty spicy. I'm decent but not that greatest with spice, so just a warning for those who come if you're not good with spice. Because the hot sauce looked REALLY appetizing but don't let that fool you because it burns! I'll stick to mild from now on"}
{"text":"When friends from out of town ask for food recommendations in Toronto, I always talk about Seven Lives. 

Every taco place I go to, I always order fish tacos and I can say that this place has the best I've ever had. The portion size of Baja fish is so big that they give you two shells so it doesn't break in order hold the size of the battered fish + other toppings. Even though the taco is $6, it is well worth its price as the portions are much larger than other taco places. 

I usually just get one Baja fish, their chips and guac (a generous amount of fresh chips in a brown paper bag), and their delicious watermelon juice to keep me stuffed.

However, you must note that this isn't really a sit-down place. There's one table, an area of the shop to stand, and a bench outside. Additionally it's cash only, so remember to go to the bank beforehand!"}
{"text":"Delish tacos for five bucks. what more can you ask? We ordered the baha fish taco and spicy shrimp. Try and give your tastebuds a treat. Be prepared to be overwhelmed by a huge lineup if you decide to pop by at noon though. Little sitting space."}
{"text":"Pros:
* Rotating menu, sometimes has interesting tacos like shark (which I actually didn't enjoy but some might like it) and octopus
* Pretty tasty tacos on their regular menu
* Average-reasonable price

Cons:
* Gets quite busy, line out the door
* No seating, no bathroom (which you will need to wash your hands after the messy meal), only standing counters which are often filled
* Very unnecessarily greasy sometimes. One of my tacos was DRENCHED, DRIPPING grease

Conclusion: 3.5 stars
* Not my favorite taco joint, but it was worth trying once or twice"}
{"text":"Baja Fish taco is a personal favourite. 

The least pretentious hipster taco place I have been to thus far. 

Not that I have anything against the pretensions of hipsters, it can just be a little off putting sometimes.

All the tacos are excellent. Reasonably priced at around $5 if I remember correctly. Cash only (would not qualify as adequately hipster if it wasn't)."}
{"text":"I liked this place but honestly based on the rating I was really expecting more. The Baja fish taco I got was good, but not amazing. There are definitely imo a few other places in Toronto that are better."}
{"text":"Gobernador fo lyfe.  This place is always packed, for good reason.  Best tacos in the city."}
{"text":"Seven Lives Tacos is a lively small taco stand/restaurant with one table and stand up bar. I opted for the takeout option as it was so busy. I had a shrimp taco and a panko breaded Baja fish taco. I found the shrimp taco to be a bit heavy with a lot of melted cheese but quite liked the Baja fish taco. Would have liked a bit more slaw on the fish taco but as there are no substations allowed this wasn't possible. The only options to customize your taco are the mild, medium, or hot salsas offered.  So rating as a taco stand, it was quite good but if you are looking for a more relaxed sit down meal with service, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"First bite in and I knew this was a five star place. The service here really good too. We came on a Sunday afternoon at 2pm. Line was short. The cashier was really nice! For such a fast paced restaurant she doesn't feel like she's trying to hurry on her customers. We ordered the gobernardor and one of their daily juices, mango and orange. The juice was so good. It tasted so fresh. 

On the side they had home made hot sauces. These were also really good! I'm surprised they make them in house. Shows that they care about their condiments! 

The taco itself was amazing.. $5 and it had four pieces of shrimp, a huge bed of smoked tuna, and a mountain of melted cheese. Their house sauce was also amazing. One bite in.. And I knew this is probably the best taco I've tasted in Toronto. I don't have too many places to compare to.. But this is definitely now my favourite and I will be craving this!!!! Such a savoury taco.. With loads of ingredients. Although the mountain was huge.. we managed to eat it without making a mess or having it fall apart.. It was a perfection of a taco :).. I just finished it 10 minutes ago and I'm already craving it again.. The hot sauces were also amazingly fresh!!"}
{"text":"Octopus is my favourite, but gobernador and baja fish are the most popular ones. It's $5 per taco, and it's very filling. There's usually a long line at lunch and very limited space for seating. Best to get takeout and eat in the park!"}
{"text":"IF YOU ARE READING THIS, GO TRY THIS PLACE OUT. During my visit to Toronto, I was recommended to go try this place out by some locals and man it did not disappoint. When you first arrive there's usually a line and hardly any seating, but do not let that deter you from dining there. I noticed that the tacos were quite pricey (around 6 dollars) each. They had quite the selection of meats and flavors to try and a nice strawberry lemonade. 

I ordered the chicken taco and strawberry lemonade and tried the catfish, pork, and spicy shrimp taco. They were surprisingly larger than I expected. Like two tacos for one person should be plenty to keep you full. First off, the strawberry lemonade was perfectly sweetened and had more of a strawberry flavor than your average one. The only downside was that it wasn't as cold as I'd like-- there was no ice. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the tacos. Every meat was well seasoned and perfect. The catfish and spicy shrimp were probably my two favorites just because the catfish was cooked to perfection (which you don't see very often) and the spices on those shrimps were SPICY. The pork and chicken were also amazing, but didn't have that X factor that the shrimp and catfish had in my opinion. I would go here every day if I could cause those tacos were hands-down the best tacos I've ever eaten in my life."}
{"text":"I think the tacos are ok.  Not bad but not great.  Maybe its just my preference.  But definitely value in it, as the prices are very good."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town. The Gobernador and Ceviche are winners. Really, anything on the menu, you can't go wrong. 
It's a small place, but don't let the crowd and cramped space deter you from getting some mouth watering $5 tacos. Your taste buds will thank you for it."}
{"text":"My favourite place in the market! I regularly walked past the old location on Augusta and memories of the most recent taco I had there with their delicious home made green chili sauce would come flooding back, making it impossible for me to resist the urge to head in for just one more. With their new location just a block east on Kensington, at least now I'll have to make the effort to walk a block to get my fix. So far I've tried the fish, octopus, and carne asada and they are all equally delicious making it difficult to choose. The new location was easy to spot as I rounded the corner from Baldwin heading south along colourful Kensington due to the people spilling out of the small shop. Everything looks spiffy, including a neat TACO sign behind the counter (see my pic). Eating that carne asada (marinated beef) taco at the new spot gave me an epiphany with a rush going thru my body as I could clearly feel the hot sauce setting off a buzz as I ate it with my eyes closing spontaneously. Absolutely wonderful! The beef had the best flavour that I've experienced in recent memory. And the fresh juice was magnificent. Only $2 for a satisfying glass of fresh mango juice, simply amazing! With value like this in a restaurant, it is easy to see why big chains rake in huge dollars with their cheaply made food and fancy marketing. Another fine addition to Kensignton, Seven Lives keeps me happy!"}
{"text":"The reviews sum it up. It's delicious... I mean, after all, it is tacos. The fish tacos were delicious, as were the non-fish ones (though I think I would pick the fish if I had to choose one).

The lineup was a bit messy. Considering how long we had to wait (lunch on a weekend), not sure if it was truly worth it."}
{"text":"Get the Gobernador! The smoked tuna is so unique and tastes amazing, easily one of the best tacos! 

Place is usually ridiculously busy, which is its one drawback...but if your patient you shall be rewarded!"}
{"text":"You wouldn't think kensington needs or could bear another taco stand, but with  ceviche that is almost better than sex, and delicious shrimp tacos and daily juice combos (cucumber lime!) I say:  don't walk, run to Seven Lives."}
{"text":"I've have the supposedly best tacos in New York and nothing compares to these tacos. They're bursting with flavour and perfectly balanced combination of textures. I've gone back again and again and have never been disappointed with their fish tacos. The portions are incredibly generous too for $6/taco.

Would not recommend the pulled pork tacos though. They were oily and tough."}
{"text":"Located in Kensington Market. It was packed on a Sunday.

Pros:
- Decently priced
- Good service
- Tastes good.

Cons:
- Wait is really long.
- CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"I had their cabeza (beef cheek) and spicy chicken taco. There was no seating space so we had to stand and eat. It's a little expensive considering there was no seating arrangement and it's cash-only. The spicy chicken taco was good. They also had variety of sauces that one can drizzle over the tacos"}
{"text":"Always try the ceviche and the carnitas! =D Always my go-to! However, the baha is pretty nice as well as the squid! =) be prepared for long lineups!"}
{"text":"Best fish taco in the city. Watermelon/strawberry juice also awesome. Ceviche seemed ok to me but as I'm no expert on this dish can't really make a comparison."}
{"text":"i had a $5 octopus taco with all the fixin's here* it was delectable.
the friend i was with liked it so much that he took a photo to reminisce with a travel-to-LA buddy. pretty good, yah?... especially, while Toronto has recently stepped up its taco-game, we all know mexican food tends to be better south of these cold borders.
service was good. 
*stall was presentable. curious about how they do in the winter without much standing (let alone sitting) room.
try'er!"}
{"text":"First of all let me just say that I ordered 2 tacos - the fish taco, and the octupus taco as I'm a huge fan of octupus. The fish taco was fantastic; fish perfectly crunchy on the outside, soft on inside, great toppings.  

However, the octopus taco was one of the worst dishes I'd ever had.  The smell was atrocious and almost rancid.  The texture was so unbelievably chewy that I couldn't even swallow my FIRST bite before calling it a day with this one.  Stay away!  In their defense, the price should have been a huge red flag for me. You simply cannot get decent octopus at $6.

We also got some chips and guac which was perhaps my favourite part of the meal. The guac was so fresh and delicious, and the chips were a perfect accompaniment."}
{"text":"offering food in a tiny place is such a clever idea to attract people. There is always a line up. 
Even though it is busy, the service is quick n good, which earns one extra star.
I had the baja fish and gobernador. Gobernador was very delicious and flavorful! Liked the smoked marlin in it. Baja fish was good, but I've had better fried fish tacos at la carnita (In cod we trust). You can also choose any sauce you like. 
The tacos were tasty. 
Cash only. I think they should probably put more chairs since they are charging $5 a taco, otherwise many people are just standing there wolfing down their tacos in order to get out of the crowd."}
{"text":"Man can these guys can make a taco!!!  Honestly the best I've had in Toronto and I've run the gauntlet of taco joints all over the GTA in search of Cali quality tacos. Seven Lives is that shop.   Their Baja fish taco is literally my favorite thing to eat, period.  Fresh fish nicely cooked in a perfectly seasoned batter with great texture.  What sets the whole thing off is the home made selection of salsas.  The hottest one (my fave in terms of flavor profile) is a five alarmer so go easy on that stuff, but do drizzle it on everything you buy.  I wish I could put the words together to truly make you realize how good this place is.  Despite being busy the food is always consistent.  Love this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"$6 for tacos but it was really good and I can see why the line up was so long. Got the Baja fish tacos and devoured it pretty quick, even though it was a bit messy. The size is decent, with a good amount of fish and veggies, but the tacos were double layered which is a plus. They have a couple other flavours to choose from. The gobernador also caught my eye which has smoked shrimp and cheese, will definitely come back to try when I'm in the area. Also, this place only accepts cash!!"}
{"text":"heard great things about this place. Checked it out tonight. To be honest one of the better Mexican places ive been to in a while and  at reasonable price. Not alot of seating which is awkward but other then that great food and thats what it should be about!  Ill def. be back!"}
{"text":"Oh holy crap! Best taco's I've ever eaten, everything was excellent! Try the spicy shrimp if you would like to see the face of god."}
{"text":"Read about those tacos, my son was craving for some tacos, we gave it a shot! We took the pulled pork tacos and by 5:30pm they were out... Don't expect side dishes, because they don't have them neither... Two tacos is plenty of food for an adult..."}
{"text":"Easily the best fish tacos in Toronto. They are almost as good as the fresh tacos I enjoyed in either California or Maui - the home of fish tacos.

It's easy to walk by the Seven Lives - its just a small restaurant in the Kensington market area. The restaurant is tiny - only one table and some wall shelf seating for about 6 people.  They also have two small tables outside on the sidewalk. If you arrive during a busy time (which is most of the time), you will need to get your tacos to go. Be careful, they are very hard to eat on the go (ask my shirt!).

Tacos options include: Blackened Mahi Mahi, shrimp, octopus, Marlin and Pork. I had two Mahi Mahi taco and they were incredible. The fish (and all other flavours) are pre-marinated and really fresh. Taco toppings included tomatoes, guacamole, onions, lettuce, sour cream and house sauce. You can also add mild, medium and hot sauce from bowls located on the counter. Each taco is wrapped in two soft grilled tortilla shells. Tacos are $5 each and worth every penny. 

Nothing is made in advance - each taco is cooked fresh to order. A key factor in the incredible taste but can mean up to a 30 minute wait to get your tacos (they tell you the approximate wait time when you place your order). The restaurant and front sidewalk is packed with people waiting for their order. 

The taco is ultimately worth the wait in my opinion... but you need to bring your patience (which I don't usually have unless it's for food). I recommend placing your order and then going around the corner to Thirsty & Miserable for a quick beer while you wait.   

They had this big jug of fresh Strawberry and Guava juice on the counter. I highly recommend you try this - it's really good and refreshing. I think they change the juice flavour daily. They also have original Mexican Coke. No alcohol on the menu. 
   
GO TRY THESE TACOS NOW. I will be back for sure... and I'm already looking forward to it.

{"text":"Absolutely the best taco in toronto!
So flavor and really good price.. wish they have more seats"}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --

This is my second time going to Seven Lives Tacos. I remembered the tacos tasted very good during my first visit (around a year ago) and I always wanted to come back to try it again. We were here on a Saturday afternoon after the Jays game. There was a huge line up in front of us (more than 20 people in line). That day was 30 degrees and there was no ventilation there. The entire restaurant has a strong scent of fish and sweat and the experience was very unpleasant. 

-- Food and Drink --

We ordered 3 Baja Fish Tacos and a grapefruit soda. As expected, the baja fish taco still tasted incredible! I liked how their batter wasn't very thick but still very crispy. The fish was very fresh. The salsa sauce complemented the mahi mahi perfectly. The taco shell wasn't soggy!
I love the grapefruit soda! It was very cold and it taste like a mixed of orange and lime soda. 

-- Overall -- 

The waiting time was way too long (around 15 - 20 minutes to wait outside to order and another 15-20 mins to wait for the food). It's not a bad idea to pick a weekday non-peak hour to go there. I would go back for the food for sure."}
{"text":"Just wanted to update my review... to confirm these are the best tacos in TO."}
{"text":"The following are changes to the menu effective May 15, 2017. The price of fish has substantially increased.

Gobernador - Changed fish from smoked tuna to smoked marlin 

These tacos are no longer on the menu:
* Catch of the Day
* Black Pepper Marlin 
* Blackened Mahi Mahi - Price of this fish has sky rocketed due to lower catch rates
* Mushroom and Cactus 
* Poke 'N Chips - Salmon

These tacos are added to the menu:
* Cuitlacoche - Corn smut and black bean.
* Cabeza - Beef head meat. No meat from the brain. Meat from cheeks.
* Adobada - Spicy pork and pineapple 
* Pollo Asado - Grilled chicken thigh

I ordered the Cuitlacoche and the Adobada. The Cuitlacoche is corn and black bean in some stretchy  cheese in a double blue soft shell torilla. It's suppose to be better than the Mushroom and Cactus. I wasn't impressed. Vegetarians might like this. The Adobada is spicy pork with 2 pieces of sweet pineapple, guacamole. The pork was OK, but not spicy in my opinion.

Overall, I didn't really enjoy these 2 new tacos. I will try the other new tacos just because they are new on the menu."}
{"text":"Fav fav fav taco place right now! I'm really impressed with the quality of the tacos they cook up for only $5 each--had the carnitas and the grilled blue marlin, which were both amazing; so flavourful, moist, rich and very generous on the amount of meat they give you! Each taco ended up. being more filling than I thought, which was a great surprise.

The one missing star (would've been only a half star if they'd let me) is only because of the waiting time. Since this place is super popular, the wait for your food can get quite dragged out, and they don't really make the tacos according to what place in line you ordered. I got my tacos after 15 min, the bf got his after another 15.

There's not a lot of seating so we had to take our tacos to go.  My tacos got a little soggy because of this delay but they were still good. The food was worth the wait. Will definitely be coming back to try every single taco on the menu. They were that good."}
{"text":"The Carnitas were sold out but we were lucky enough to get our hands on the Baja, Gobernador and the Blackened Mahi Mahi before it was all gone.

All 3 were delicious, but my fave was the Baja. It was crisp on the outside and flaky on the inside. One of the better fish tacos I've had. The layering of flavours was excellent. It was a Mexican fiesta in my mouth.

The only down side were the sauces labeled at the front, usually \"hot\" means kinda hot and is catered to the masses, this was not that kind of hot. After a few heaping spoonfuls and a few hours later, my insides are still burning, but well worth it.

Seating is limited with long lineups, but if you can look past that, it's worthy of your time."}
{"text":"lunch with the kids. shared the gobenador (sp?) and baja fish tacos with chips and guac. 10 minutes wait in stuffy heat was worth it.  staff were all super friendly, singing to the music. great vibe and food deelish as usual"}
{"text":"I'm still a fan of this place but some changes have occurred since my last review.  

1. Prices no longer include tax.  
2. The baja fish didn't taste as moist and flaky as I was hoping (but the size is still very generous).
3. There's poke on the menu but it may just have been a special.  
4. The line is crazier than ever.  

What has stayed the same?

1. 3 kinds of salsa (mild, medium, and hot) and limes for you to add at the end of the counter.  
2. Wet naps are provided and you will surely need one or two.  
3. The ceviche is always sold out whenever I go."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon around 12:30-1pm.  When i arrived, there was already a line up.  Waited for a good 7-10min, i didnt mind because there was live music and it was a nice sunny day.  Service was straightforward and quick. Time it took to make the tacos was quick too.  I got the cobanator and baja and the strawberry lemon drink. Portion for the two tacos was very generous.  The initial bite of the Cobanator taco was fresh and tender and juicy, and the baja was also juicy and tender.  Would i come back again? Yes i would, given the price per tacos were fair, $6.00 before tax per taco.  The drink was $3.00 before tax, refreshing and simple and good to wash down the taco down.  Overall, fair price for a juicy, tender, fresh, flavourful taco.  

Definitely a must try if you happen to stroll around Kensington market and feeling hungry.  

This is cash only, make sure to bring enough cash to try at least  4 - 5 different tacos as it is worth the try."}
{"text":"This is my only place for seafood tacos in Toronto. 
Huge tacos for the $5 hefty price... I could never eat more than two. 
The Baja and Camarones tacos are better than in California!!! Give it a try and you'll get hooked just like I did!"}
{"text":"I doubt I need to be adding a review to this place because the internet has already basically blown up with taco happy Torontonians happily stuffing their faces with Seven Lives' fantastic fish and meat tacos, but I am gonna throw my voice into the hot sauce stoked fray because I really, really like these tacos and because I can almost never make it through Kensington market without getting one or six and eating them all by myself on a stairway like a deranged, starving seagull. 

For a snack.


But I digress.

These are my favourite tacos in Toronto. I particularly like the blackened mahi mahi and octopus, but you cannot really go wrong unless you don't order anything. Do not be put off by the sometimes absurd lines, complete lack of table space and brusque service--- taco paradise is so worth it. Do not be intimidate by the sometimes absurd crowds, either. Fight your way into the corner and claim the additional hot sauce you love and deserve. 

You're welcome."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here two Sunday's ago and I'm already thinking of going this weekend :) 

This is a really great find! Fresh, made to order, great hot salsa! 

My favourite is the ceviche and second to that is the baha fish taco."}
{"text":"Didn't like the long lineup but what can you expect from toronto food. 

Great tacos, I liked the Baja, the octopus, and the Mahi mahi. Their ceviche was killer and I normally hate ceviche. 

Great place for a quick meal if you're in Kensington. Must eat in toronto"}
{"text":"These tacos are pretty filling--two are a solid, rib-sticking meal. I always get the Baja and either the catch of the day or the carnitas. Their agua frescas are usually pretty solid, but I'm not a huge fan of over-sweetened drinks. (My favourite is their cucumber mint.) There's usually a line when they first open, so get there a few minutes early or wait until the crowd dwindles and maybe head in around 1 or 1:30 for lunch."}
{"text":"I decided to give the place i try after finding it on yelp. Let's start off with a long line up out the door for these yummy tacos, the service was great the asian cashier girl had such a positive attitude and the food was good. I would consider it more like a snack rather than a place to get dinner because 2 Baja tacos ($10) didn't really fill me up but it tasted great. This is also not a place where you can sit and eat either, there are limited seating and benches outside for such a busy place (warning you guys) I mean if it wasn't busy i'm sure you could sit. Overall cute, friendly, and a tasty place."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Seven Lives for sooo long but every time I walk by, there's a line up.  It's a small, small space, and I don't do line-ups very enthusiastically, so I've never gone in.

This Sunday, though, we were walking through the market and just by chance, there was no one lined up, and I was like, \"OK, we gotta got tacos.\"  My boyfriend was a bit unsure at first - \"Tacos for breakfast?\" - but once we were in and the line instantly formed behind us, he realized it truly was a lucky break.

We tried the tuna/shrimp taco and the blackened mahi mahi.  We both like the mahi mahi better even though I didn't think it had as much fish.  Both were quite good though, and they happily removed cilantro from both which I always appreciate.

There is basically just standing room and where we got a space was right on top of the garbage cans, so not really a relaxing meal if you're looking for that.  No washrooms for guests, so you have to go around the corner to Moon Bean Cafe.  

I would go back to try other tacos, overall good experience."}
{"text":"Really and must have while in Toronto. Small but delicious and friendly staff. There will most likely be a line to get in but it'll go by fast just be patient and it'll well be worth the wait. 

The tacos specifically the mahi mahi were excellent and the ceviche was fresh and just the right amount of acid. Beware of some of the hot sauces they are very hot."}
{"text":"Likes:
- Solid tacos - 5 stars. They're made fresh to order, but yea get the baja fish.

Dislikes:
- Atmosphere - 3 stars. Seating is extremely limited, there is only one small table inside, a small L-shaped standing table and 2 benches outside. I'm not a fan of standing while I eat, so had to knock off one star.

Tips:
- Menu items are frequently sold out, so go early if you want more selection, especially on weekends or holidays.

Seven Lives is one of those places where we always make an effort to stop by for a mid-afternoon snack. However, we haven't had a full meal here since we usually have lunch / dinner plans whenever we go downtown. They rose their price from $5 to $6 per taco plus taxes, though the price is still pretty reasonable for the amount of food they give. 

Baja Fish Taco - It is very unlike me to order the same menu item repeatedly from any food joint. But since I don't visit enough, I always end up getting their ridiculously good baja fish taco. The huge piece of flaky haddock is bubbled in a light crispy batter, and the slightly creamy yet refreshing coleslaw cuts the fattiness. Adding the sweet and tangy mild salsa plus a few wedges of lime just completes the meal. The taco is quite messy to eat, so be sure to grab a fork and lots of napkins. 

Octopus Taco - The other item we always order is the octopus taco, which is surprisingly tender and it's my husband's favourite. The protein is nicely contrasted with chopped celery stalks and onions, which adds a nice texture and slight herbal and peppery flavour.  We saw them throw in a few drops of Maggi seasoning sauce, which is similar to regular soy sauce, except it's richer and deeper in flavour, almost as though the soy sauce had been roasted. I personally prefer the baja fish taco over this, but the tender octopus is definitely a strong contender, and they give you lots of it.

We've also tried the blackened mahi mahi before, but it looks like it's no longer offered on their menu.

Next time we go, our goal is to have enough discipline to try out their other tacos!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick bite. Tacos are made fresh in front of you. Service is friendly and quick. I've always had a good experience here. Only downfall is there is no washroom. But they have a great selection of different taco toppings and spices"}
{"text":"This is a 3 star review because of the wait time. 

I have been here twice in the past few months and both times I've had to wait in a lineup for over 20 minutes, which has a negative impact on my overall experience.

The tacos are very good. I like the Baha fish, and I've also had the octopus which was quite tasty, but nothing special. 

If you're prepared to wait a while, The baha fish taco is worth it."}
{"text":"This place is everything people have described in reviews before me and so much more. I tried the gobernador and the spicy shrimp which is my fav! I think I had dreams about it. It's $5ish per taco and they also have fresh juices available but I missed out on that this time.  
It's a small place with very limited seating but there's some room to stand and scarf down those delicious tacos. I'm definitely coming back here to try the octopus, the ceviche (which looked like a very generous portion), and my fav the spicy shrimp. 
If you haven't been, go now but be prepared to wait in a line up. Trust me, it's worth it."}
{"text":"There's not much I can say that the others haven't already said. Delicious tacos--especially the gobernador!--and the aguas frescas are a must-try."}
{"text":"Seven Lives, will you marry me?

My search for the perfect taco is over. I will be undyingly faithful to Seven Lives for eternity, forsaking all other taco joints.

While walking down Augusta, I almost stopped into their old location, not realizing that they had moved. On my way down Kensington Ave, I noticed that they had a groovy new storefront on the east side of the street. Since I was headed to the bank machine and had missed my lunch earlier on, it was simply fate that I fell in love today!

There still isn't a whole lot of space, but they have some stools by the window and a nicely carved wood picnic table in the corner. The guy at the counter could not have been nicer. I asked if they had the Lengua (tongue) tacos and he mentioned that they only have them as a special once a month or so, but he did suggest the octopus taco, so I ordered that, a baja fish taco and I had to try the ceviche. 

When my name was called I carefully regarded the massive tacos that seemed larger than the last time I had been there and proceeded to slather them in delicious hot sauce. I doused my ceviche in a healthy amount as well. 

The tacos were absolutely crammed with fish and I wasn't sure how to go about picking them up being that they were very hot, so I began with the ceviche. I almost fell off my stool and fainted with love! The tender pieces were marinated in enough lime to be give flavour, but not so much as to be nothing more than fish swimming in a pool of lime.  I used to tostada on top to scoop up mouthfuls of the beautiful hot pink pickled onion, sweet shrimp and tilapia. and was delighted to discover that the tostada that all this deliciousness was sitting upon was slathered in a layer of guacamole.

I'm not a girl who is often at a loss for words, but I'm not sure how to accurately describe my adoration for these perfect crescents of toasted corn, stuffed to the gills with so much flavour and texture.... I felt like I was doing something illegal, or that surely, these were too good to be true and that someone was going to come and take them away from me. 

I might have given the stinkeye to the guy who sat down next to me waiting for his food.

Two of these tacos and half the ceviche was enough to fill me up completely. I packed up the other half of the ceviche and brought it home to my boyfriend who may now want to marry Seven Lives instead of me.

What a tangled web we weave when the love of a taco is involved. I won't say that this place is cheap. It cost me $19 on the nose for 2 tacos, ceviche and a strawberry mint drink (which was delicious and not too sweet). But it was more than enough to fill me up. 

Okay, so maybe marriage is a bit extreme, but Seven Lives can be my high class taco gigolo any day of the week."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite taco place in Toronto! The Baja fish is my favourite but the Gobernador and octopus dish are also extremely delicious! I always make sure to stop by whenever I'm in Kensington. 

The restaurant is quite small and always very packed so beware! Servings are also on the smaller side so maybe buy 2 tacos if you're really hungry. The tacos itself are quite messy to eat as they are quite packed full so be ready to get your hands a little dirty.

Overall, one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto and would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was told, you HAVE to try the Gobernator. So I ordered that and the Baha one. I hated the gobernator....but I did love the Baha. I will definitely go back to try a couple of the others, The lineup went pretty quickly and I didnt have to wait long, so don't let the amount of people deter you. The 2 tacos were plenty to fill me up, both generously filled with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Came here one sunday afternoon. The line was outside the restaurant, as always. Ordered the Baja and carnitas tacos. Each for $5. The carnitas was only ok. The taco itself wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"What an experience.   The ingredients were fresh with the perfect mix of spices.   

I stopped in when they were offering a special Cajun catfish that was as tasty as one can imagine.  Their chicken tacos were equally as delicious.    Seating is limited, however I managed to hover by the door eating while standing and my suit survived the ordeal - although not the smartest of choices.  LOL 

Advice: portion sizes are large, two tacos were more then enough for me."}
{"text":"It's OK. We tried four different tacos (smoked mackerel & spicy shrimp, Carnitas, spicy shrimp & cheese, and Baja-fried haddock) and none of them blew us away. Guacamole and seasoned blue corn tortilla chips were good. Looked like they were struggling today as they screwed up our order leaving one taco off originally and messed up at least three other orders that I saw. They were also out of salsa at lunchtime!!! It is an extremely small restaurant with seating for about 4 people and a couple of small areas to stand up and eat. It is CASH ONLY and will only do a dollar-for-dollar conversion between USD and CND, which is a rip off when conversion rate today is $1.35 US to $1.00 CN.  Luckily we found an ATM at a bank within a 5 min walk."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. One of, if not the, best fish tacos I've ever had. Ordered the Baja and the Catch of the Day, which happened to be a grilled Swordfish with avocado. In both cases, the fish was generous, with one large portion of each filling up the entire tortilla, with a blend of sauces well balanced to enhance but not overpower the fish itself. The hot sauce you could add to it was also on point. The Baja was delicious, but the swordfish taco was on another level...just wish it was part of their regular menu. Soft tortillas, but double layered so that there was surprisingly minimal mess.

Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the price; At $5 a taco that's a little steep. Also the ordering can be a bit slow as the restaurant space itself is small and there is essentially no seating. I'll be able to forgive that though because they cook all the fish to order and deliver you consistently delicious tacos."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place! I love the atmosphere and that every bite of a taco here is full of flavour. They have delicious California Baja-style tacos for the right price. For first timers, order the Gobernador and your dreams will come true! Seven Lives is a Kensington market favourite."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best taco in the city. Every taco was delicious and unique compared to other places.

Get one of the freshly squeezed drinks too, they're refreshing in the sun and helps kill the spiciness if you went with too much of the sauce.

Would have had 5 stars if the space wasn't so small and very very limited seating. Food is definitely a 5 star though."}
{"text":"I had two wonderful tacos today. The Baja Fish taco was very fresh, with generous amounts of mahi-mahi. The Carnitas were excellent, and it seems like they brown them before putting them in the taco which is a nice touch. There is no seating inside, aside from a bench table combo. There are counters you can stand at. I walked here from my downtown hotel and thought it was worth the mile."}
{"text":"Came to this place after listening to a friends recommendation. Great tacos and amazing staff. Daily special was also great, not to forget the blackened cod. 

Erica"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  The place is very small and can get crowded fast but the food can't be beat.  I ordered the baja taco, grebenador taco and the ceviche.  The tacos were pretty good but the star of the show was definitely the ceviche!!  I can't wait to get back and to try more ceviche! The portions are very generous and the juice of the day looked interesting.  I will definitely get that the next time."}
{"text":"Tiny burst of awesomeness!
Tried the octopus and blackened mahi mahi taco, just divine!  Amazing beverages!
This place is very small, so grab and have a lovely walk around Kensington Market! Will return to try the shark, the ceviche and the cactus-mushroom!"}
{"text":"By far the best food I've had so far downtown. I've been trying all the places within 1km of Spadina and Queens and this is the best one in terms of taste. 
It's a big costy if you're a big eater ($5 for a taco tax included, I can eat 3-4). But even so the cost to value ratio is still very good in my opinion. I personally like the grilled pork one the best. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The place is tiny but the tacos are so tasty. I was lucky to get some tacos and try a good variety of the menu before it got even busier and I was not disappointed. Even though I had to enjoy them in the car. This place is definitely one of the gems of Kensington market. It's probably a must try if you're in the area. It's definitely worth the wait. The fish is amazingly fresh and offer fresh crisp ingredients in the tacos. One of my favourites was the Baja fish taco. The batter was like light but it was still nice and crispy. Whenever I'm in the area again I will definitely go back and try even more of the menu. Didn't get to try the ceviche the last time I was there and I've heard such good things about it. This place is a must try in Kensington market."}
{"text":"Seven Lives lives up to the hype! It's delicious and fresh! I tried the Baja fish and the ceviche. Get there early as they run out! 5:30 on a Thursday evening I snagged the last ceviche and they ran out of the poke and chips before I was able to sample any :( On the list for next time."}
{"text":"Decided to check it out after hearing some great reviews about this place!  I ordered the Mahi Mahi Tuna taco and the Carnitas.  I really liked the Mahi Mahi Tuna and found the Carnitas to be over cooked and no lacking flavour.  They have different types of hot sauces and really watch out for the really spiciest one!  The person informed someone else that it burns your lips but I thought I would be fine with that spice level!  Sure I was wrong, it was burning hot and my mouth was literally on fire!  Can't remember how many liters of water I drank while I was eating my tacos!  I will definitely go back to try other tacos and maybe reduce the amount of really hot sauce on the tacos!   Expect long line ups!"}
{"text":"The taste of the taco was pretty good but the presentation was sloppy. Also, the whole restaurant seemed quite dirty. The service was quite rude too. I expected more from such great reviews."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos. I haven't had many tacos, but these are definitely the best I've ever had. They have three different types of salsa that you can add, and the spicy has a really good kick to it. Just don't overload because the spicy is really SPICY."}
{"text":"yum!!!!! I got three tacos, not realizing how big they were. Two is definitely a very filling meal. I wanted to finish all three though because wow! They were great. Pictured here is the carnitas and one with shrimp!"}
{"text":"I went to this place because of the fantastic yelp reviews but in reality I found this place to be overpriced and not so good. Each taco is $6 and trust me a single taco is not filling enough. The seating is also extremely limited. The only good part was the fact that the ingredients are fresh."}
{"text":"Wish i lived closer so i could eat this more often really delicious and fresh fish tacos! the energy in this place is so cool too its very quick and fun i highly recommend it if you're in the kensington market area!!"}
{"text":"Great fish / seafood tacos. I wish that they had more meat options. Mole. Carnitas. Barbacoa."}
{"text":"Everyone in this city LOVES tacos! So this is THE place to go. Although it's small, and the lines can get lengthy. It is worth it! There's tons to be offered in Kensington Market but Seven Lives steals the show. 

I have tried the Baja Fish (makes me drool, thinking about it), the Gobernador (smoked tuna, shrimp & cheese), the Camarones a la Diabla (spicy shrimp) and the Pulpo Enojado (grilled octopus). All of them deserve trying. 

I can be full off a 2 tacos, which in my opinion is great cause it's not expensive. They double layer their tortilla wraps which i don't personally like so I just take off one layer. 

Try going at non peak times or right when they open so you don't have to wait long."}
{"text":"Probably one if my fav taco place in North America! Really good choice if you're looking for a quick bite. Really cheap for 1 big taco ~$6! There are 3 sauces mild medium and hot. The 3rd one was really really hot even for me who like spicy foods. 
I tried the spicy shrimp and blackened mahi mahi. The shrimp is da bomb! I dont usually prefer shrimpt because of the fishy smell but here, nothing smells fishy and it's very soft! The mahi mahi is also good but not as good as the shrimp"}
{"text":"Look. Let me get straight to the point. This was the best taco that I've ever had in my life. Normally when I get busy with a new meal, I like to savour the flavours bite by bite, taking my time to appreciate nuance. When I took a bite of this gift to humanity I went through the following: giggling to no one in particular, doing a little jig to the music playing across the street, saying the lord's name in vane, etc, etc.
I ordered the Gobernador. When you undoubtedly order the same, you'll be handed a flour tortilla taco starring: smoked tuna, shrimp, red onion, and cheese. You'll start questioning if this little thing is going to do anything for your hunger. I'll be honest, this will not replace a meal, but the experience will be more than sufficient. If you can handle the heat, take my advice and add some of their house made hot sauce. Don't go mild. Go hot and EARN the bold pairing of spices with the succulent smoked tuna and juicy shrimp! Killer meat combo.
In summary, if you happened to be walking by Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos while on the brink of death from dehydration, and then were served one of these masterpieces, you wouldn't drink water and risk washing these top shelf flavours off your tongue. Respect it. Go."}
{"text":"I don't care how many times this has been said, but I just want to add that this place got the best fish tacos in town. The Gobernator is great with the smoked marlin that eats like a meat, served with shrimp. Also really enjoyed the Baja, salmon and blackened Mahi."}
{"text":"$5 each for the tacos. They are generously sized. I ordered the cheesy shrimp (I think that was the name) and the baja fish. 

The shrimp was - eh, okay. The fish was great - highly recommend!  For the price, $5 is a bit much for one single taco. I didn't give them 5 stars because the tortilla isn't that great. It's a bit dry and hard. 

Also - this place always has a line in the weekends but it's worth it. Definitely try to come earlier before the line and before things are sold out! Will be back for more to try other items when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"i am converted.  I have never cared for tacos (i've been to la carnita) and always felt like taco bell could satisfy me.  but no more!  This place gets super packed so be prepared to wait in line.  Also, there's practically no seating here.  SO worth it though.

I tried the baja fish taco which is the deep fried mahi mahi.  MY GOD.  it is so good. Instantly made me want to go and have fish and chips.  Also, when ordering, I'm a super picky eater so I had a few things I didn't want in my taco and the guy behind the counter was really cool about it and attentive.  bonussss.  I also had the blackened mahi mahi taco.  Kinda sweet with some random spices, but also really good.  I love how the tacos are $5 with tax already included. another bonusss.  I would come to just buy the mahi mahi (fried or not) on a plate if they served that.   Also, the guac they put in the tacos is amazing. The only complaint I have is the actual taco itself.  My friend said it's made of corn (I have no idea) but it's really not that good and it left a smell on my hands after eating it.  I need to come back and try all of them!  I'll be dreaming of the baja fish taco tonight."}
{"text":"The best fish tacos in TO, Period. 
Does it seem a tad pricey for a taco, yes. but boy they are good. I have been here more than 3 dozen times and have always had their fish tacos. Whether its the gobernator or the blackened mahi-mahi, they are always on point. 
"}
{"text":"Based on the fantastic yelp reviews, my friend and I just had to check out this place. I appreciated the heads up from a reviewer about this place only accepting cash. I got the pork shoulder taco and baja fish taco. The fish was great but it had more batter than fish so, half my taco was just crispy batter with toppings inside a tortilla. The pork shoulder...was... 
AMAZING! It had so much tender meat and a nice balance of fatty bits. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! I will definitely go back for that taco and for the friendly service :)"}
{"text":"First visit was over the lunch hour this past Thursday. Clearly the word is out about this little hole-in-the-wall taco joint as there was a non-stop lineup during our visit. Line moved quickly and we actually obtained a spot at the standup eating area along the wall.  The place is slightly claustrophobic with so many people jammed in eating and in line, so hopefully they'll make some adjustments to the logistics.  
I had the sliced pork with cilantro and pineapple. 2 tacos (all are $5 each) filled me up, so the value is certainly very good. The pork was tender, savory and delicious. The taco shells are corn-based and doubled up - good idea s they do tend to disintegrate the longer they are in contact with the filling!  My colleages had the other pork taco and one of the fish tacos, and both declared them delicious.
This is a great addition to Kensington Market's lunchtime food offerings!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Spicy Shrimp Taco my favourite but everything on the menu is delicious! Service is always really good as well! So glad these guys got a spot of their own"}
{"text":"I was disappointed by all the hype over this place. The $5 tacos were okay.

I'm glad that I got to try to place as I've been wanting to go here for a while.

If you get the shrimp taco, they don't skimp on the shrimp. My boyfriend really enjoyed these. The place is super tiny so it's more than likely you won't find a seat unless you come earlier or not during the rush. I ordered the mahi mahi taco, which was good with the fish cooked well. I liked the mahi mahi taco the best. The Octopus taco was interesting, the octopus had a meaty chewy texture. 

Not the best tacos I've had, but good if you want something to eat that's cheap, filling, and in the area."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I have ever had, period!
The selection leans towards the California style taco, but that's not a bad thing. Expect fabulous flavours, perfectly cooked ingredients, and getting maximum value for the dollar. My favourites are the pulpo (octopus) and the camarones (shrimp), but the mushroom and cactus or carnitas (pork) aren't far behind. Mmmmmm, tacos! And get the fresh fruit juice for just $2 - how can you go wrong? The menu includes plenty of gluten free options so everyone can enjoy the fare.
Okay, the place is small and a bit of a dive, but who cares? If you need to have your tacos served on china and your drink in Riedel crystal, this place is not for you. You have to be willing to eat with your hands and take what space you can find, so don't get too fancy here. Me, I would push my way through the crowd any day for more of those tacos!"}
{"text":"I've searched long and hard for fish tacos that would match up (or even beat) all the fish tacos I ate in California in a span of 3 years, and I think I've finally found them. They didn't beat them, but they did come pretty damn close. 

I had the Blackened Mahi Mahi and the Baja Fish. I also tried a bit of the Gobernador and the Mushroom and Cactus. 
-Blackened Mahi Mahi: my absolute favourite. The dry rub on this taco was great and it had a bit of a kick to it. I've also been a bit of a guac snob, but I decided to eat it since it was on the taco and I loved it.
-Baha fish: amazing, but very messy! Not too salty with the crispy coating, which was a great thing.
-Gobernador: loved the smokiness of the marlin. It added all the salty flavors that the taco needed. 
-Cactus and Mushroom: there was a heap of cheese on top of the cactus and mushrooms. Need I say more?

I also decided to have their juice of the day which was cantaloupe. Super yummy!

Why not 4 stars? They ran out of the carnitas and salmon, there's a lack of seating and and no booze, but I still had a great time! I will definitely be back :D"}
{"text":"A tad expensive for what you get, but what you get, is really good. Gobenador taco with smoked Marlin and spicy shrimp gives you a flavour of what to expect."}
{"text":"I'm from the U.K. We don't do Tacos well. On the whole.

This was my first Taco experience in Canada and I was not let down. Came here on a busy, warm Saturday afternoon. There was a queue [I think you say 'line'?] of about 6 in front of me but it moved quickly. I ordered a mushroom and cactus taco to go. Was told it would be about 10 minutes or so which was nice to know because it let me go do a bit of vegetable shopping. The service was great. To say they were busy was an understatement but they were still flashing out the smiles, despite having to deal with the demanding woman next to me who was firing out questions that her eyes could have answered for her:
(Demanding woman: Where are the forks? 
The voice in my head: Try the pronged, plastic utensils in the container 30cm in front of your face
Demanding woman: Where are the napkins?
The voice in my head: If you couldn't see the forks then you'll never find the napkins, they're in the container kissing the fork container)

To the food. It was great! Lots of flavours going on, lots of colours throughout [whilst I would always take taste over presentation, I like it when my food is visually interesting]. There was an option of fresh sauces to choose from, ranging from mild to hot. As a North American taco virgin, I only made two mistakes when I left Seven Lives Tacos. I didn't take a fork and I didn't take a napkin. Forgive me if you passed me on Kensington Market with guacamole dripping down my English chin, I'll know better for next time. a.k.a next week no doubt."}
{"text":"Personally, I have never been a huge Mexican food fanatic here in Canada. 

Truth be told, I lived in Mexico for a few years and I find 98% of all Mexican restaurants to be not only overpriced (I have ranted about this many times before), subpar but mostly, just not authentic.  Most \"Mexican\" restaurants fall into one of these three categories. 

And SLTYM is no different. Sure, it is a taco joint. Sure, they are tasty, but I assure you, they are not authentic. By a long shot. Smoked tuna in tacos with cheese? Sure, that's authentic. 
;-|

The truth is, there are very few restaurants in Toronto that I would call authentic, however for the sake of not sounding like a broken record, I will deviate, from my usual rant and say this:

As far as tasty food in the shape of tacos, SLTYM is pretty good. I had the Gobernator and a few others and it was great, I liked the flavour. It is a fast food joint, to which you will often find a line up and the place will be packed. A testament to their making of great Mexican similes.

They are not expensive and if you are in the area and want to try something very tasty, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"They're all great but the pulpo is out of this world - they've gone back to the original recipe but I kinda miss the grill octopus they had in between"}
{"text":"This is truly a contender for the best taco I've ever had. They're mostly fish tacos though they do have pork - and it is one of the best bites of pork I've also ever had. Love the Cajun mahi mahi taco, spicy shrimp...all of them are really are 5 star. Everything is super fresh and try their homemade juices. Also, I love the corn tortillas and even the smell it leaves on your fingers."}
{"text":"Best Tacos in Toronto!!! It's always busy so be patient.... they are worth the effort! Bring cash... everything is amazing on the menu with the exception of the cactus taco."}
{"text":"Food is amazing the flavor that these tacos have is unique and very tasty! Wish the restaurant had more seating.. I'm not to find of standing and eating but none the less it's bomb"}
{"text":"FISH TACOS.

I first heard of this little quaint store when I was just wandering around Kensington. It is packed! It was not so much a friendly seating area. It was definitely more of a order stand or get out and go type of dining experience. 

The tacos was great. I never had fish tacos before...but for the portion and price of it was certainly a bit disappointing. I was not full after ordering two tacos that were bite sized...I even ordered a drink. I was a bit frustrated as I was quite hungry and was expecting a bigger portion. However...for a first time thing the tacos were quite delicious. Buttttt.....if you wanna be full you might have to dump in around thirty bucks if you have a bigger appetite like me."}
{"text":"I cannot explain how absolutely delicious the tacos were. My friend grabbed them after work for us and they were amazing. I don't even know what ones we had but both were fish. And both were AWESOME. They also gave us Hibiscus tea for $1 because they were just about to close. Great experience!"}
{"text":"This place is just okay. Not quite sure why it gets such crazy hype. The flavours are good and authentic flavours. Two tacos are large enough for a meal. But it wasn't crazy cheap nor particularly innovative. 
The gobernator was dry and the octopus was too chewy (sign of being overdone )
I'll come back once more to try the Baja fish and the cactus but I don't expect my mind to be blown. 
Ok. Not throwing my money at them."}
{"text":"Customer service is pretty shit here. The food is decent. Tasted a lot better the first time around when they first opened. Now it's a monster and quality has gone down. I guess quality doesnt follow volume just like other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I am thankful that I found this place. There is finally a place in Toronto where I can get my fill of good mexican food. Took a walk over here with the girlfriend and the dog and decided to try a baja fish taco and a ceviche. The fish taco was great, nothing to go crazy about and definitely not as good as the fish tacos that I have had in California. The great thing about it though was they they were very generous with the servings of fish which is what I really look for in these restaurants. The ceviche was by far the best thing I have had in recent memory. I had very low expectations and I was shown something that I will remember for a while. There was a very generous serving of guacamole and seafood and both were very fresh and delicious. This was much better than other ceviche's I have tried even from California. To top it all off, this place has mexican coke, something I never thought I would find in Toronto. Look forward to going back here."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever experienced!  I've had the fried fish tacos and the garlic shrimp tacos.  OMG, the flavor is amazing.  These tacos are huge and come out hot and made to order.  There will be a line outside before they open, do show up early or be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Seating (probably the biggest/only trouble with eating here):
Indoors - There is an L-shaped table ledge where you can stand and eat. I guestimate that about 7-9 people could eat along it. Also, there is one table where you can seat about 6 people. My friend and I opted to sit outdoors instead of sharing the table. 
Outdoors - There are 2 tables with 2 chairs per table. I feel that I should mention that the table was a bit sticky, but I'm pretty easy going so it didn't really bother me. I just avoided resting my arms and hands on the table.

Food:
We shared 4 tacos.
All the tacos featured really fresh and vibrant ingredients which translated to great flavour. We appreciated how each taco had its own unique, complex flavour.

Baja Fish - having the fish deep fried really adds a nice crunch
Gobernador - the cheese mixed in with the smoked marlin provided a really good base of flavour. The shrimp were quite fresh and tasty on its own.
Catch of the day (snapper) - The snapper was grilled nicely and added a nice meaty, flaky texture to the taco.
Carnitas - I personally would take a pass on this one. My friend and I agreed that the spices used on the pork were not appealing and were really pungent. I honestly think that a choice of salt and pepper seasoning would have made the pork taste better. But the guacamole on top of the pork was flavourful and really fresh.

All in all. I'd definitely come back here to try the other tacos. $4-$5 FLAT for a loaded taco is a pretty good deal. Everything was really fresh and flavourful. After the meal, it was pleasant to have my hands smelling like tortilla. Ideally, I'd like to come back during off-peak hours though."}
{"text":"My party of 3 ordered the Pulpo en Mole Verde (octopus), Baja Fish, Blackened Mahi Mahi, and Carnitas tacos + ceviche!
After being out of the country for two months, I missed Mexican food more than anything and this place definitely satisfied my craving. 
The portion sizes are larger than meets the eye with 2 tacos easily filling an average girl like me, and the prices are affordable. Lingering at $5/taco and $7 for the ceviche, I would say the quality and taste of the food is worth it's price. The carnitas was quite generously loaded onto the taco and topped with fresh tomatoes and guacamole. It was my first time trying octopus in a taco and while thinking it would be an odd texture, it turned out to be rather tasty (perhaps even my favorite one)! 
The one downside to this little shop located in the middle of Kensington is that it doesn't offer many seated areas (just one picnic bench inside and two park benches outside) so you may want to keep that in mind for larger parties/personal needs."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Toronto. Try most of them and you'll find the one you love.

My true love is the gobenador... so damn delicious.

Btw ... there habanero sauce is extremely spicy so beware! It's so good though, I'm always in tears once I'm done my food 5 so worth it)"}
{"text":"My friend suggested that we go to eat tacos at her favourite taco place - Seven Lives! I had super high expectations coming here because 1) I've never had tacos before 2) the line was long (good indicator of delicious food!) 3) yelp reviews were through the roof!

I got the
Carnitas - braised pork shoulder
Pollo asado - spicy grilled chicken

The food took around 10-15 minutes to prepare because of the long wait line but they employees were working to keep up with the pace. I put mild sauce on my tacos and had a seat and was ready to inhale my food. First impression was that they put lots of meat in it so you're getting more than enough for what you're paying. Second is that the tacos are greasy (so avoid if you don't like oily stuff). Third is that the food was piping hot!

I did like the tacos but they were okay and it didn't blow me away. My friends enjoyed their tacos and suggested that I had chosen the wrong options which maybe they were right. I would definitely consider returning to try their more popular tacos."}
{"text":"I'm giving four stars with hesitation.  Part of enjoying food is have a place to eat.  We were forced to stand in a hot crowded room.  The chicken taco had bones in it, one star.  The three others we tried were pork, spicy shrimp, and spicy pork with pinnapple.  All at least 4-5 (the pork shoulder had a lot of fat on it) stars except for the the tortillas.  They needed additional grilling and fell apart.  We tossed them and ate the filling.  Because of the rush eating we won't we back."}
{"text":"Seven Lives serves up (albeit slowly) some good west coast style tacos in the heart of Kensington.

With little counter space, this small place has a menu of 9 different tacos, priced at $5 each ($4 for the vegetarian option). I tried the blackened mahi mahi (grilled tuna) and the spicy shrimp w/ cheese tacos on my first trip here, and I'll echo other's opinions that they do a fine job here. Double layered toasted, soft taco shells, and cooked to order with great flavours. Of the two, I preferred the spicy shrimp as it was pretty flavourful (read: spicy) and dripping with goodness (tip: grab some napkins). I'll be back to try the octopus!

Be warned that there may be long lines, and the orders come out rather slowly.

Now, if only someone will make a burrito ala SF's El Farolito, I'll be a happy camper :)"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos but this is more of a grab and go kind of spot. I haven't had a bad taco here yet. I think they are cash only so be mindful of that."}
{"text":"Seven Lives? Well, of course! It's a delicious take out place. It's not really a restaurant since the seating space is very, very limited. If you haven't you should pay a visit. Whenever I go I pick up two tacos for myself, usually a gobernador and a squid taco, and go to Kensington Park to sit down on the grass and eat. It's a bit more convenient to have take out here now that they take debit/credit. 

The tacos are on the big side, quite loaded up. Each one is wrapped in two maize tortillas.  There's a bit of cream in the sauces that go in them. The tacos here are pretty similar to seafood tacos I've had in Mexico.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great price for crazy yummy and filling tacos. I love the Mahi Mahi and Baja Fish Tacos. And can't beat that price! Just wish they were open longer."}
{"text":"Mmmmm mm good fresh tacos! Had the battered haddock and it came w fresh chopped tomatoes. Perfect blend of textures. Very small store with minimal seating area but space for standup tables. Would def chk it out again!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favourite place to go in Toronto/GTA for tacos. Each taco I've had from this place for the past two years has been PHENOMENAL. I can't even pick a favorite taco because they're all so good but my top 3 definitely include the gobernador, the baja, and the camarones (spicy shrimp). Each taco is extremely flavorful, never dry (moist and saucey without being soggy), and stuffed with filling. For $5, you cannot go wrong -- I usually get full after 2 just because of how generous they are with their fillings. Cannot rave about this place enough -- JUST GO!

Warning: their hot sauce is no joke!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic here. Really good. I have some minor quibbles. The tortillas were dry and not great quality. But what goes into the tortillas. Magic!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a few people over the years and finally had the opportunity to check it out. Although the space is quite small and limited in seating, their tacos are worth the standing up while eating!

Tacos are $5 and cash only. Good thing the bottom of my purse was of full of change.
I ordered the gobernador, grilled octopus and hibiscus juice. My brother ordered the baja fish tacos and spicy squid. 

- Gobernador was my favourite out of the four. 
Tuna with shrimp and cheese! The flavours were nice and blended well together. 

- Grilled octopus was a little overcooked and chewy for me but it was nicely seasoned.

- The Baja fish tacos was nicely battered and stayed nice and crispy till the end without sogging as per my brother. 

- The spicy squid had a real nice spice to it without it not being overwhelming and also was full of flavour. Hibiscus juice was... different ... but it paired quite nicely with our tacos.

Definitely would return for the gobernador though!"}
{"text":"Let's just start off by saying I am a San Diego, California native. Somehow I found myself living in the country side of north New York. I'm guessing not many people would think New York even has a countryside? Anyhow, here in the north country. We literally have NO REAL FOOD. Now you know with the border so close, I had to make a trip out to Toronto! And I literally came out here JUST for food. That's how real the cravings are. 

THIS PLACE RIGHT HERE. Is THEEE BEST spot for authentic, street tacos or tj tacos (what we call It in San Diego lol) I have been away from home and real mexican food. Not that Tex Mex stuff, for months. I mean like close to a year. How can anyone survive without having food like this?! 

On to the food, we had to save some room you know. Since our whole trip to Toronto was based around food lol. My husband and I ordered three tacos to share. Knowing I could've had like three to myself. We ordered a fish and 2 cabeza tacos because I didn't want to share lol.

These tacos are huge. If you don't know what cabeza is, who cares. Order It anyways, because it's Bomb af lol. No but really, cabeza is the meat from the head, cheek. Face? you know, It sounds weird but it's delicious. The meat was super soft and tender, sounds so cliche but It literally MELTS in your mouth. They also had homemade salsas which paired perfectly, choose your heat! I loved them all, the hottest one was actually really spicy. But I'm into that kind of thing. 

On to the fish taco, this came out so hot and fresh. It stayed crispy and flakey while I was finishing up my cabeza taco! I wish I was back there, eating one right now. If you've never had a fish taco, what is your life?? It had the usual cabbage slaw, nice white sauce, fresh tomato onion pico. The flavors are so well balanced and dance in your mouth giving you a taste of everything. 

Basically, don't give It a second thought. Go for It, try something new. You won't regret It!"}
{"text":"In a cramped little shop in Kensington Market, Seven Lives Tacos is putting out some of the best tacos you'll ever try!

Jostle your way through the crowds hanging about and place your order (cash only). On recommendation, I tried the carnitas (pork) and octopus tacos. The carnitas tacos was one of the best I've ever had. Grilled corn tortillas stuffed with tender juicy pork edged in a dark flavorful bark and piled high with a multitude of flavorful toppings. Simply amazing! The octopus wasn't my favorite. A bit tough, chewy even and with a celery-heavy dressing that was almost overpowering.

That said, it was still better than most tacos you'd find elsewhere. As for their carnitas, I would fight Toronto traffic both ways for one of these. It was that good."}
{"text":"If you're going to the market, THIS is definitely the first place to visit. During peak hours, the line may be long but  it is worth the wait. The taco seem bit expensive, but worth every penny for me. Every bite is explosion of flavors. I got two tacos, the baja fish and spicy shrimp & cheese. Both tacos had bold flavors but does not overpower the protein. I would definitely come back again!!!"}
{"text":"TACOS are large. Store is small.

I liked it- they had different hot sauces."}
{"text":"Amazing. Best fish tacos ever. We're tourists and were told to try Seven Lives, and it was worth every step we took to get there. It's a small place so we took ours to go and ate outside."}
{"text":"Seven lives is super busy with neverending lineups and some of the tacos sell out if you come later in the day.

Ordered Baha Fish, Adobado (spicy pork and pineapple) and Pollo Asado (spicy chicken)

The good: for the most part the ingredients are spectacular, super fresh, tasty, and the various topping/spice combinations that they put together are a perfect, well thought. The pork and chicken were both cooked and seasoned to perfection. It was sooo good. When paired with the toppings... wow, so good

The bad: their soft taco shells don't do the rest of the ingredients justice. They give two tortillas per taco, and I found them a bit dry and too thick. Also, the baha fish taco was underwhelming for me, it was mostly fried batter. Maybe I got a bad piece as others rave about it. It looked more like fish and chips put into a taco shell. Finally, cash only and seating is pretty much non existent

4 stars"}
{"text":"YUM!! Can't go wrong coming here. Seven Lives sure knows how to do their tacos. 

I tried:

Baja (fried fish with tomato and white sauce topping)
Mahi mahi (blackened fish with guac and salsa)
Gobernator (mish mash of fillings)
Octopus

I've listed the tacos in order of preference. The baja was so good!! There are hot sauces and limes available to put on the tacos, but I think the tacos were all flavourful enough by themselves. I put some medium hot sauce on the octopus. 

I'd definitely get the baja the next time I come back. And probably the mahi mahi again too. I want to try the shrimp and catch of the day as well.

Only thing is there's always a line, and they aren't open that late on weekdays. But I'd say it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Cash only. I was surprised they didn't accept any cards, debit, credit.

You get a couple of sea food options, baja fish, shrimp,.. one beef option a couple of pork and one vegie.

Long line any time of the day, no space to sit, a counter which u will not be  able to use , outside there is a bench which ia full, so u better walk and eat, which is part of Kensington Market culture, so if u looking for sth fancy u r at a wrong place.

One Taco is not enough for a meal, 13$ for two is a bit overpriced. The quality of the food is good, fresh ingredients and very tasty. So I would get one and explore the rest of this heaven."}
{"text":"Not sure what's the hype about this place. It's \"A-OK\", but not deserving of 5 stars. I must say I have had better fish tacos elsewhere in downtown Toronto. Can't judge other kinds since I didn't order them, but baja fish is always what I order whenever I visit a known taco place.

Went over this past weekend and as expected, it was packed. Luckily, we were able to find a seat after ordering. We waited for 5 minutes and were told that the fryer was broken down. Then we got told that it's okay for now. Immediately after, they crossed out the baja fish box on the menu. I guess we were the last ones to have their batch of baja fish for the time being until they fixed their fryer? Waited around 15 minutes more for our tacos to arrive. Had it, it's not bad and definitely not as amazing as some of the reviews have claimed here. 

Would I return? Yes, if I was in the area and craved for a quick snack. I wouldn't purposefully come here for fish tacos."}
{"text":"some of the best tacos I've had in Toronto. Always busy make sure to go earlier in the noon. Love the staff very attentive, and they seem to have a low staff turnover look is always a good thing"}
{"text":"I just ordered the Baja fish taco I don't see what the hype is about. It was mostly batter and very little fish and drenched in oil! 

I picked up the taco and oil was pouring out from the other end. 

I'll never come back here again. Much better taco spots in Toronto. I actually love the tacos at grand electric on Queen. $5 each and they are beyond delicious."}
{"text":"I was so happy to finally be able to eat here because while I lived in Toronto they were doing renovations for the longest time, and now that I'm back, I'm glad to see it's open again.

This is honestly the one surprise that I didn't expect to find in Kensington Market, which is already chock full of amazing food. It's small and has barely any seating (a definite con, but also a backhanded pro maybe?), but it's got food which will light up your taste buds and make you feel happy and satisfied in a way only truly amazing food can.

I would suggest ordering two for a person (with an average appetite), because they seem bigger than they are, and the price is definitely affordable for the amount of food you're getting. 

WARING: THE SALSE VERDE AND SALSA ROJA ARE HOT AND TOO MUCH WILL MAKE YOU SEE GHOSTS, SWEAT BALLS, AND FEEL LIKE YOU'RE MAY GET A HERNIA. USE WITH CAUTION"}
{"text":"I always drop by Seven Lives whenever  I visit Kensington Market.  This is the to-go to place in Kensington for food. 

The tacos are so good and full of flavour! They are reasonably priced because they are actually really filling! The ingredients are always fresh and tasteful.

It's always so busy here and there's always a line of people waiting. The place is a little too small with limited seats however. The tacos are definitely worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"Located in Kensington Market, this restaurant is quite tiny. There wasn't much space to dine inside, and there was 2 benches outside to sit. 

We came half an hour after opening time and there was already a line. 
I had their catch of their day (rainbow trout I believe) and after eating it, I understand why there was a line for this place! The fish was fresh, fatty and cooked perfectly! There was some skin on the fish and it added some crispiness to it. My friends tried their octopus tacos and thought it was kind of chewy.

I thought my taco was amazing and full of flavour. $5 a taco, I would return to try the others. $2 for lemonade is also not a bad deal.
Definitely recommend this place for tacos!"}
{"text":"A true gem in Kensington, love the Blackened Mahi Mahi and Gobernador. Flavourful, perfectly portioned and 5 per taco, it's an excellent snack or pair a few for a meal. Compliment that with a chilled fresh Agua Fresca, delish!

Cash only and limited seating. Rotating fresh catch of the day. Different hot sauces for flavouring. Don't wait, haul yourself here for one of the best taco places in TO :)"}
{"text":"Visited this place on a random weekday... We came at about 2 pm and was able to order right away. They made our Baja fish taco fresh. It took maybe about 20 minutes to make. I felt the fish was thin so the batter really made the fish nice and crispy. Yummy."}
{"text":"The tacos are incredible. The flavours work so well...and the menu has enough options that of the four of us each got smth they loved. For me that was the carnitas taco. So juicy...enormous too! The guacamole was the only thing I would not try again...a but bland.
Atmosohere is great, it's always super busy and there is only a small table inside so in the winter you will probably grab and go.
Can't wait to go back for the ceviche tostada."}
{"text":"As a Mexican I'm confident enough to say that these tacos are in my top 3 favourite. (Competing with restaurants in Mexico)

The place is too small and no sitting space at all. There's usually a huge line too.

Definitely worth the waiting!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best taco place TO has to offer - on $5 per taco one might say the price is steep, but these babies come in real SoCal style of double taco shells! For dinner 2 tacos is more than enough and i usually get insanely full. 

The famous gobernator consist of smoked marlin, shrimp and cheese - if you like seafood and especially smoked fish - this one will send you to food heaven. 

Seven Lives restored my faith of tacos in TO!!  
Beware though - they don't open everyday and when they do they close at 8pm, and seatings are very limited. It also gets messy to eat sometimes because the delicious juice will gush out as you bite into the taco like a hungry monster."}
{"text":"I dream about these tacos all the time! Tucked in the heart of kensington market. If you do not go early, expect a line up! Their tacos are huge. Definitely two will fill you up. Their baja fish is really good and their spicy shrimp is also reaally really good. Definitely also pick up their watermelon juice as well.

They also have a small salsa selection (from mild to extra hot) at the pick up. I believe their salsas are home made and they taste really good!"}
{"text":"Since my friend and I shared some fried chicken at Dirty Bird next door, I still had a bit of room to try some legendary tacos at Seven Lives. I wanted to get their signature fish taco, except they had sold out for the night and only had a few meats remaining.

- Pollo asado taco: chicken was literally melt-in-your-mouth heaven. I haven't had chicken this good in a really long time (then again I've been mostly cooking my dry chicken breast for the past few weeks, so my standards are pretty low. But that said, the chicken was so delicious and flavourful). It was a bit messy, since the filling easily falls out the front and back of the tortilla (probably didn't help that I was walking and eating at the same time haha), but it was worth every bite. 

I hope to be back at Kensington Market soon so I can try their signature fish tacos! I guess I'll try and get there earlier, instead of right before they close, and hopefully they'll have some left :)"}
{"text":"You end up paying $9 CAN for one taco if using American cash which is pretty lame, and they mislead you with California paraphernalia all inside as if they're US currency friendly. That hassle plus the long line plus it's 20 deg hotter in the place than out and mehh"}
{"text":"Delicious! The wait is long but is it worth it. By far the best tacos in Toronto. The tortilla shell is soft and more tasty than other homemade tortillas we have tried in the city. Love the wide selection of fish and seafood tacos. There is very limited seating so be prepared to eat outside or while standing."}
{"text":"My fav taco place!!! Even though the line is crazy but ita well worth it!!! If you like fish tacos you have to come here n try it out! Their Mahi Mahi ia my favorite!"}
{"text":"This is a must if I am ever in Kensington market. I've had most items on the menu so far, and I love everything about them. There is a really great kitchen team, and the open concept makes you feel like you are part of it. The ingredients are always fresh and the fish has always been cooked to perfection. Delicious!

The only thing I don't like about this place is the line up, and the lack of standing/sitting space. Otherwise, amazing!"}
{"text":"These tacos are amazing especially their different pepper sauces. 5 Stars for the Tacos.

Make sure you check the times they close and you must have cash on you because they don't take credit or debit smh."}
{"text":"Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos is located on the east side of Kensington Ave between Baldwin and St. Andrew right in the heart of Kensington Market.

Their name is larger than their dining area.  Their dining area basically is a stylish log type 4 seater and... that's it.  There's standing room off to the right for maybe 6 max?  This place is small just like many other places in Kensington where space is just a premium.  They do make some famous tacos however and they're famous for a reason.

I've been here a few times and only now am I writing a review.  Their food is a good benchmark to compare other places to because they have a way of doing things that makes them a little different from other places.

Tacos here are around 7 bucks a piece.  It sounds a bit expensive for a single taco but when you get a single taco here it's not really a single serving - well it sort of is and it isn't.  By definition they're giving you a single taco, double packed tortilla but it's like a third of a plate of food put on top of two tortillas.  To me, I can't really call it a taco if I can't pick it up and begin to eat it and here you just can't do that.  If somebody wanted to do that I'd honestly like to see them try.  If you did (I'm imagining here) you'd lose two thirds to three quarters of your filling in your attempt.

What am I trying to say?  I'm saying what is served here at Seven Lives cannot just be picked up and eaten like a normal taco because they give you a little basket of food on top of 2 tortillas.  If you don't eat what is on top of those two tortillas, you won't be able to pick up your taco and eat it.  To put it another way they pack a lot of food in that basket and by definition, it's not a taco until you eat most of what is inside that basket.  

Personally I would actually be happier if they took everything in that basket and made 3 tacos (6 tortillas) out of it all instead of a single triple  packed would be taco.  My personal critique is they put too much into a single taco.  I'm not complaining because what they make is so good but I just wish it was spread across more tortillas to make more tacos instead of just having one.  I'd pay more to make it a 3 pack instead of a single, would you?

This place though there's no option for that, at least not on the menu.  I don't think I'd ask for it either.  They do however make some amazing tacos here, if you want to call them that. 

Carnitas are superb as well as I love the octopus.  I've had one of the beef cheek before too.  There's lots going on in this little place and they keep things going on in Kensington."}
{"text":"I'm vegetarian, only option was mushroom & cactus tacos ($4 each, but pretty big, I ordered two and felt it was enough). I really liked the tacos: lots of mushrooms, toppings were tasty, guac was good.

EXCEPT, customer service was poor, and on top of that, there was an oriental girl with short hair working there that seemed to be in a horrible mood. She gave me a very dirty look at some point, and when she saw that we pulled a chair from another table, she rolled her eyes. I kept worrying if she had 'sabotaged' our tacos... 

Because of her, I will try the many other taco places around Kensington before going back there."}
{"text":"My go to place for quick tacos! Don't expect an eat in restaurant... They have pretty much one table and a couple of stools by the window. But that was ok as I took it out and ate at a park nearby instead! 
Back to the tacos, they have a pretty good variety of stuff. They have a lot of seafood choices and a couple of meat choices for the carnivores out there. They're portions are big in my opinion and everything on the menu is pretty much $5. I ordered 2 tacos - baja fish and carnita. DELISH! as mentioned, they're pretty big tacos so the amount of fish and meat I got on each of my tacos were quite significant. Along with the toppings that go with it. And you add your own level of heat. They also double up on their thin tortillas which is genius because it didn't make it overly thick and bread-y but the first tortilla made a great barrier for all the sauces and juices from soaking into the second tortilla! 
If I lived in this area, I'd be in trouble as I would literally eat there everyday (but I guess weekly would suffice :D)"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite fish taco in Toronto. Crispy. Light. Flaky. Tasty.
Service is speedy.
Staff is friendly.
Love that they have a choice of salsas.
And unlike other taco places in the city, they were willing to change my order for a food allergy."}
{"text":"WOW. You won't be able to comprehend how good these tacos are until you give it a try yourself!

My boyfriend's sister brought me and my boyfriend here, she had been here a few times and could not get enough of it. I normally don't eat tacos from restaurants because I feel like homemade tacos are just as good or even better and I've also had a few restaurant tacos that have been disappointing. However, this place has proved me so so wrong. These tacos are worth every buck you pay and every minute you stand in line. The tacos are $6 each, I ordered 2 and it was plenty of food, though if I had more stomach space (and more money), I would have loved to get all the tacos on their menu! I ended up choosing the baja fish taco and the spicy pork and pineapple taco. The tacos have two layers of tortilla, which is very necessary when you see how much filling they put in it! The baja fish was fried perfectly and the fish meat was flaky and moist. I don't know what sauces they put in it, but it all went well together and every bite was just as good as the last! The spicy pork also paired very well with the diced pineapples that added a nice refreshing sweetness. After I finished the taco, my takeout container still had a lot of pork pieces because they really pack the tacos full with ingredients. My boyfriend and his sister both got the baja fish and the octopus taco which they really enjoyed, however my boyfriend accidentally put way too much hot sauce on his tacos to the point where it burned his mouth so please use in moderation! 

If you are looking for a life-changing moment, go to Seven Lives Tacos!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here a long time but was always scared of the crazy line up! Finally, I mustered up the courage and went inside..and thank god I did. 

My cousin and I ordered two tacos each which is good if you want a meal. We both had the baja fish, the spicy pork and the grilled octopus. I definitely recommend the baja fish. The spicy pork and grilled octopus is also delicious too! 

One bad thing is that there are literally no seats, either stand by the counter to eat or sit on the bench outside if it's not already taken!"}
{"text":"All the tacos are amazing.  My favourites are the shrimp tacos and the octopus in the green mole sauce (but they changed it)."}
{"text":"For years, I have been a die-hard fan of Grand Electric but I finally gave Seven Lives a shot.... I think I found my new taco spot. I got the baja fish and blackened mahi mahi. Where do I start... I love that this place doubles up on their corn tortillas. The portions are big and they don't skimp out on fillings. I can go up and grab as many lime wedges as I want (as opposed to bugging the waiter for more and more limes every time they walk by). Tacos are $5 a pop and I was full off 2. The space is small and seating is limited, but if you're okay with eating and standing then definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I went here for one taco so I could try other foods in Kensington. I ordered the baja fish taco. It was delicious. One of the best fish tacos I've had  

There is no seating so if you are going, don't intend on having a sit down dinner."}
{"text":"Fave taco place in the city! It's usually rammed when I go and sometimes tacos are sold out. But I love getting the cool mexican sodas as well!"}
{"text":"The secret is to do it one thing very well. That's this place. When we FINALLY got our Goberdenader and Baja tacos, they were sublime. Seems there is Always a line which made me want them. Very small. Not really good for eating in. No one seemed to mind. Just wish there was a little more instruction as it seems mass chaos in figuring out where the line is. Took us about 45 minutes. But I would probably do it again. I didn't think I would like the cheese on the Goberdenador but I didn't notice.  The pickled onions added great balance. I am still thinking about them.  It all worked so well. I would have loved some the secret sauce that was on the Baja. But the little salsa bar was great. Only reason it's 4 is that is just takes too long. Go here."}
{"text":"Everything is good but know this:
-cash only 
-tiny space, expect a line up 
-nowhere to sit and eat 
-the hot sauce is very deliciously hot 

We ordered the baha fish taco and the mixed seafood ceviche tostada. Both were excellent, very fresh, and good value - gourmet taste. 

Also very good that the inside is air conditioned"}
{"text":"The best taco place in the city! If there is a long line (which is always) it is definitely worth the wait"}
{"text":"Blackened Mahi Mahi is killer ! Totally amazing and only $5.00.  Better then from 
the Food trucks I've tried in California ( and I thought those were the best ). Cool little place in a hip spot.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Hands down THE best tacos I've ever had. I had the baja fish & gobernador *drool* I would come more often if it weren't for the location (too small and difficult to get to)"}
{"text":"hands down no messing around best damn tacos in the city.also very consistent product everytime.(big props I know cause i work in the industry too, consistency is a tricky part) i've recommended this place at least a hundred times and so far none of my friends have been disappointed.if you haven't tried this place yet you is missing out son. 69 kensington is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Blackened mahi mahi. That's all. Do not expect to sit because it's so good you'll be running to grab another one in no time, that, plus the slim probability of being able to find a seat (expect to eat while standing). 

All other taco joints please stand aside."}
{"text":"This place actually blew my mind.  I never knew tacos could taste so damn good but it could.  I think I found the meaning of life."}
{"text":"First time visit. The staffs are friendly and efficient. It was a long queue, 10 people before my turn. Waiting time wasn't too long.
Baja fish taco were excellent!
Sadly, lemonade was sold out."}
{"text":"Seriously?! I've been coming to this place for years and I'm shocked it's taken me so long to write a review.

This place is a m a z i n g... Hands down the BEST tacos in the city and trust me it lives up to the hype! I bring people hear all the time and talk about this place and no one has yet to disagrees that the tacos are the best they've had (Ok, I lied on friend argued that his abuela makes better tacos... but to be fair grandmas are the best cooks and that's homemade food lol) and the food is consistently good. 

Faves here are the carnitas (it comes with super tasty guac), baja (always fried to perfection), and my ultimate fave the Spicy Shrimp!!!!! They got rid of it in the summer but thank god they brought it back, along with slightly higher prices ( from $5 to $6) but in all honesty it's a small price to pay for delicious and filling food :) 
Ps. The house made salsas are also great! The spicy is suuuuuuper hot, but unlike some hot salsas it has great flavour and taste... but use sparingly as again it's super hot lol"}
{"text":"These tacos are the best tacos I've had in Toronto. 
Completely satisfies your taco cravings and hits your personal, and deepest taco spot. 
My first visit to their new brick and mortar store was during pedestrian Sunday. The lines were long, sun was bright, the orders were plentiful, flowing, and the wait time was 6-10 mins. An extreme case I assume, but even so, the tacos came out in their mound of glory; fresh and perfect. Diced tomatoes, onions, sauuuce, on top of the most crispy, battered fish. 

For a flat 5 bucks, you get a decent sized, double shelled taco full of punched up flavor, and fresh condiments. I opted for the Baja fish, went back in line 4 mins later (after downing my first) for the shrimp. Both equally delicious (even better with a drag of their salsa verde). If you're a fish taco fiend, I'm telling you, look no further or anywhere else. It's right here."}
{"text":"Hubby  and I are native Californian's and absolutely love Mexican food! We actually sought out Seven Lives and El Trompo (read the review for that as well). Tacos here are authentic and fresh with awesome flavors. We stopped and had tacos at El Trompo first (wished we would have drank less there to have more room for tacos here). We only tried two flavors: carnitas and grilled mahi mahi, both were delectable. Try the juice of the day as well...fresh and tasty! If you love Mexican; don't leaveToronto without stopping here!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food here. Definitely by far the best tacos we've had in the city so far.!  I ordered the Baja fish and blackened mahi mahi and my boyfriend ordered the Baja and Gorbornator. Both fish tacos were a perfect mixture of an explosion of flavours and left me wanting more! My boyfriend inhaled his before I even had the chance to steal a bite so safe to say he loved his as well.  My fave was the mahi mahi and his was the Gorbornator.  Place was packed, but an organized chaos. Seating is very limited and cash only, but service is pretty quick considering. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Huge portion and good food, they are very busy but the bad part is they also get sold out of some of their menu items."}
{"text":"Amazing! Grab tacos, eat in the park. Cheap and better than most taco places in the city!"}
{"text":"Must have been an off day before because the chicken and shrimp tacos I just had were as good as they've ever been. Perfectly grilled and caramelized chicken cut into perfect cubes, thin sliced pickled carrots and a crema sauce. The spicy shrimp is my go to and it was perfect.
The salsa macha was also a nice touch."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype!!! 

Best tacos I've ever had. Ever. Before this, my impressions of tacos were: expensive, small, never enough. After eating at Seven Lives, I'm happy to say that I am looking forward to eating more tacos that are cheap, big, and filling. 

It's already been said before, but try the Gobernador. Sooooooo good. I got that one and the Baja fish. The Baja was good but the Gobernador is a tough taco to follow up. 

The place is really small. Like ridiculously so. I'm pretty sure it can only hold like... 10 people. Any more and it would be a fire hazard. I normally don't say this, but I think that it actually adds to the charm of Seven Lives. 

So many people had said good things about Seven Lives, and I was scared that I had set my expectations too high. But honestly, it's just that good. 

10/10 will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Despite being to Seven Lives a handful of times, I always forfeit review writing in favour of a food coma induced nap.
 
After a disappointing taco night on Tuesday, I urged bf here to fill my taco cravings for lunch.  

Atmosphere: loud, trendy, crowded with people ordering, waiting, and stuffing their faces. Maybe a total of 10 seats?.. so if you get one, consider yourself lucky!

Service: 
The guys and gals behind the counter are friendly and almost more importantly, efficient. Despite the line up, they work quickly to cook each order fresh. Cooks hand off to the pass, where each taco is dressed and presented with a smile. I really like that you can see the prep area- for the sake of transparency. 

Food:
Today, got the gobernador [$5] (smoked marlin, shrimp, onions, delicious) and the mahi mahi [$5](blackened and topped with housemade slaw/salsa). Both were made the second I ordered- served hot and fresh in little plastic baskets. 

The biggest problem with the tacos at Seven lives is that they're so stuffed with hot seafood that one has to start eating with a fork before being able to pick it up real-taco-style ... tough life, eh?

The food here is worth awkwardly hovering, holding the basket with one hand, inhaling  tacos with the other."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a few tacos. Small menu, small place, and cash only. 

We ordered the Baja fish taco and the gobernator. 

First off, the Baja fish taco was delicious. Served with a huge chunk of fried mahi mahi fish, house sauce, and cheese. The fiancé really enjoyed it. 

The gobernator is served with smoked tuna and shrimp. It was topped with pickled red onion and honestly, I can't remember the rest. I kind of inhaled it. The gobernator was so hefty that two pieces of tortilla were required to keep it from falling apart. Although, towards the last few bites, I was fighting to keep the taco together. 

There are a lot of seafood options like octopus and catch of the day. Only one meat option (pulled pork) that was sold out for the day and cactus and cheese as their vegetarian option. 

Can't wait to try the other tacos when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Did not disappoint. Best tacos I've ever had got sure. You can taste all the freshness in it. I add the Baja fish and my friend has the grenador or something like that. But we're streaming hot and amazingly flavourful. Our orders were finished so fast but quality was definitely not lacking. I've never experienced so many different flavours that harmonize so well between a tortilla. It's was crunchy and moist and tangy and savory and streaming and refreshing. Getting hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Kensington Market. This place is busyy! Plenty of locals stopping in. Tacos are a little pricey about $5 or more/piece. Yes, prices listed on the board are for 1 taco. I got 1 of each of the shrimp and cheese and carnitas taco and both were delicious! Shrimp and cheese was the right amount spice and flavor. Carnitas was juicey and not dry at all. 

Storefront is tiny. There is one table and the rest is standing counter space only. I suggest taking it to go if you don't want to stand and chow down. I do appreciate that they provide wet wipes for post meal clean up."}
{"text":"One of my favourite taco places in toronto! Tucked into one of the many gems in Kensington! 

One of my favourite things about these tacos is that they use the blue tortillas! The tacos that I've tried are amazing ! I really like the fish tacos here. They taste so fresh and the flavours go so well together! 

If you're downtown in the Kensington area looking for a place to eat, mark this on your list !!"}
{"text":"Portions getting smaller and the price are increased. I think its too much for very small portions of tacos. I dont think I will come back there again"}
{"text":"Completely lives up to the reviews. 
We lucked out and the line up wasn't too long. Be prepared that you'll have to use the standing tables if you don't luck out and get one of the two proper seated tables. 
I will definitely be going back to try out the entire menu!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the fact that the tacos are $6. As a snobby Californian, that's a lot to pay for a taco, even accounting for the exchange rate. 

For $6, though, you do get a pretty good taco. We got the Gobernator, which came out very hot but obviously fresh. Flavors melded together pretty well, though the small fish bits and large shrimp pieces were hard to keep together into bites.

There isn't much eating space inside, but the tacos are quick to eat, so there will probably be enough turnover for you to find space."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

I only tried one taco from here so my rating could change. The gobernato was two small soft tortillas wrapped around smoked tuna, shrimp, and cheese, topped with shredded lettuce and some salsa.

It had a good flavor and texture, even though I wasn't partial to such a combination. But this place is worth coming back to try other options, not the best tacos ever, but I think pretty good. Simple, easy, tasty, and filling."}
{"text":"I've had several people tell me to go here..plus, there's always a line-up outside of it...so is it worth it?  Well I definitely thought it was good.  You need 2 to get full.  But one will do for a snack.  no sitting space..well a couple of stools..but it's always so busy, you're better off waiting until the weather is warm so you can walk out with it.   
I think i'd have to be in the mood for the wait and the lack of seating.....I am in kensington market a lot and there's sooo many places to eat."}
{"text":"food is fresh and excellent. good service. would give 5 stars, but its always super busy. but definitely go! foods awesome and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Delicious! 
Always happy with Seven Lives, the Gobernador is my ABSOLUTE favorite. Bursting with flavor and juices, that smoked tuna and cheese combo omg, I need more."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about how the fish tacos would be, cuz we had had lots of disappointments in Toronto.

The first impression of the staff was awesome. When I paid, I had a great \"human kindness\" experience. The cashier gave me back the extra 20, I gave him by mistake...

I noticed that they actually had Mexican pops and \"aguas frescas\". But the big deal started in the menu. I wanted to try everything... And after my 3rd time there, I did it!!! 

I can say with confidence that there is not an item in the menu, that I could consider bad or average. This place is a guarantee of satisfaction.

I almost  cried when I smelled the tacos for putting salsa on them. The salsas looked exactly like my grandmother's ones. The habanero salsa is my favorite, but you need to be careful with amount you put in, especially if you ask for tacos that already include chili peppers.

Every time I've tasted those tacos, I've been transported to a gorgeous Mexican Beach.

This place just needs to get the liquor license to be perfect for me. I wouldn't care to eat there standing up, while drinking a cold one.

For sure you'll say \"mmmm\" with every bite!!!"}
{"text":"My favourite taco place hands down! The lines can often be long but trust me it is worth the wait. My picks are usually the spicy shrimp and the baja fish - they're both honestly so bomb. And if they have watermelon mint agua I would highly recommend. I've been coming hear for years now, and the quality is just as good as when I first found out about the place."}
{"text":"So you own a taqueria. That is good news for Toronto. Now, you can either choose to grant out of goodwill to vulgarize the decor with lame persuasion of kitschy sombreros here and there on the wall. They chose instead the SoCal way; a state flag, a surf board and modern representations of the Dia de Muertos.

We had the Baja and Grilled Octopus. I did not fancy much the Baja as it was simply a fried battered fish. The latter one is succulent. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely brilliant. Their fish tacos are literally the best I've had in TO, and believe me, I've tried a LOT of places in the city. Both the fried fish ones and the blackened ones are absolutely delicious. The only reason I have given this place 4 stars is because they're not open late enough. They shut at 7, and have run out of ceviche every single time that I have been there. 

Seriously, this place is AMAZING. 

It's usually quite crowded, so I wouldn't recommend this joint for a sit down meal with old friends, or for a date. Go there for the food! You won't even have time to catch a breath leave alone chat, in between delicious mouthfuls of heavenly tacos :)"}
{"text":"Long wait at times, but SO worth it every time!! I've never had a taco here I didn't enjoy. Fresh, delicious flavours. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The reviews speak for themselves, this place has amazing food and is definitely worth a visit when you're in Kensington market. 

FOOD:
I got the gobernador and the cactus and mushroom tacos. My favourite part was probably the cheese, which complemented the flavours of the tacos exceptionally. 

SERVICE:
I went around 3pm on Friday and the line was to the door, but the wait wasn't long and I got my tacos in about 15 minutes. 

ATMOSPHERE:
The space is quite small with just enough seats to maybe seat 10 people, so I would recommend taking your taco to go."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've ever had. This place really made me fall in love with fish tacos, which I never really cared for before. Their ceviche is a pretty big portion, and tastes very fresh. I have to be honest I don't remember the other two tacos I got since this is a very delayed review, but trust me you will not be disappointed. Try to get there before the lunch time rush so you won't have to wait too long. Their home made drinks were both very refreshing and tasty. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Rated best taco place in the city,  and COULD NOT AGREE MORE!!!!!!! When your teeth have the the treat of devouring one of these pieces of art, you'll think you've gone to heaven.....the explosion of quality, authentic flavours cannot be compared with!!!Don't let the teeny-tiny store size deceive you, inside the little shop with only one table and a window ledge to eat on, you will find taco glory!

I came at around 3:30ish, and man it was packed (where although it's not always fun to wait for food, a massive line at a restaurant almost always means your in for a delicious, worth-the-wait meal). My boyfriend and I ordered 3 tacos to split: a pork taco, shrimp and cheese, and a battered haddock. All were exquisite and very filling!!!  It's likely because there is sooooo muuuuccchhh meat and filling in each one. 

This would be a great place to visit during summer, as you can order your food and simply eat it outside (since it'll likely be packed as usual inside the store). This truly is the best taco joint in the city, and strongly encourage trying it out! :)"}
{"text":"Been here on two occasions and I can't say enough good things about the mahi mahi and Al pastor tacos. The meat is nicely seasoned and almost melts in your mouth. At first you're annoyed because this place only takes cash and there's no friggin place to sit. But once you manage to score an empty bench (or an actual seat) - all annoyances are gone and the tacos are like envelopes of love from your favourite grandma (minus the cash and grandma). Tacos are packed and overflowing, so you might wanna grab a fork or two before you chow down"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmy ! I had the spicy chicken and vegetarian tacos..... space is super tight and line ups are crazy. Worth the wait"}
{"text":"I stopped by this small shop upon the recommendation of a friend of mine.  And, it was a delightful experience.  We only stopped to get a quick bite so only tried one taco - the Gobernador.  Although a bit pricey at $6, it was well worth the taste.  

This taco was filled with smoked marlin and shrimp.  The smoked marlin was done in a way that it reminded me of pulled pork or some kind of chicken.  As a non-meat eater, it was a good taste of what I'm missing out on. 

There's different types of salsa you can add on your own as well.  Even though we only ordered one taco, it was wrapped in 2 tortilla shells and became quite filling.  A wonderful place for a quick snack or an actual meal."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos I've had in the city. I love fish tacos and seven lives certainly lives up to the hype. The blackened mahi mahi is the stuff of dreams. The fish is so tender and everything in that taco has been thoughtfully placed. The texture from the silken guacamole is enhanced with the crunchy cabbage and onions. I really cannot say enough good things about this amazing place. I also love the catches of the day. The line up sometimes appear long but they move very quickly. The sauces are great. I like to add the spicy and the medium but you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The tacos here were awesome! My husband was making fun of me for wanting to get tacos up north, but these definitely compare to the tacos we've had in California! Amazing!! And the hibiscus tea was also delicious. Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I love tacos! And I especially love pescetarian-friendly tacos! Lots of choices for those who enjoy seafood tacos and they're always delicious. Been here over 10+ times over the last few years and have always left licking my lips in delight.

Solid 4.5 stars. The 0.5 star was docked for the long lines and small space. Not so bad during the warmer weather, but not the best during winter when everyone's shuffling about in their puffy coats."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre but the service was awful!!! He wouldn't accept our order because there were too many people??? You should have a sign that you have a max order. And finally he was I don't have time for this and ended up taking our order and then when I asked for a to go cup for salsa HE SAID HE DIDNT HAVE ANY when a few seconds earlier he had given it to the guy before me. Disgusting attitude."}
{"text":"I was super impressed with the tacos here.  They are SO GOOD!!!  Everything is made fresh right before your eyes.  I am definitely going to go back again!  There isn't much seating but they were so welcoming and friendly that it didn't matter."}
{"text":"Some of the BEST tacos I've ever had.

I love how the double up on the taco shell

I came on a Saturday around 3-4 pm, the wait was 20-30 mins for a taco! and they are curtious enough to let you know beforehand. it's a long wait, since the store was PACKED and you had to stand around, seating is super limited to none. funny thing is, it took almost 30 mins to get the taco and probably only 2 mins for me to clobber it. 

Why I think it takes so long, they make the tacos order by order, there is nothing much they can do about it, there is 1 person making fries, 1 person grilling the meat/shells/frying, 1 person putting the toppings on and 1 cashier. The place is tiny, don't think they can fit more help.

wow the tacos was delicious! it's full of flavour and great toppings, It was worth the $6 parking to get my $5 tacos, will be coming back to try the rest of the flavours!

tacos are $5 each tax included

wish they opened late. especially on fri/sat? please?"}
{"text":"Kensington market itself is already a spectacle.  Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos is a good spot to fulfill your taco cravings, and if you did not have taco cravings, trying their tacos will give you future cravings.  We had only one taco, the catch of the day which consisted of trout.  We took it outdoors because it was quite crowded inside.  They only had one table and some ledges so if you were expecting to sit in, then you will be disappointed.  If it is wintertime, I don't know how it would work out.  Perhaps it is more dead during the winter.  We went when it was warm outside so taking it out was no problem. Lines were spilling everywhere but I noticed that the workers were super efficient and had telekinetic teamwork.  They were able to have everything under control which is a plus.   Overall, the taco was decent."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to go to this taco place for forever and finally got the chance to go today! Got the Baja fish taco and the pollo (grilled chicken), both were AMAZINGG! Each is $6+tax and I don't normally eat a lot and two was enough to fill me up. The place is quite small but service was quick and prompt and they have free water that you can get yourself. Overall, a very good taco experience"}
{"text":"After going to this place twice, I was starting to wish I had an undo button for my life."}
{"text":"Love their Baja fish taco. I love that you can top with any level of spicy sauce you want. Best yet that it only costs $5 per taco. I usually get full with 2 tacos. Its such a tiny little shop (more like a fast food joint rather than sit down dining). we often have to squeeze in the benches to share a table or we just walk around outside and sit on the curb on the street."}
{"text":"Love the food! Had spicy shrimp and the Baja fish. 
Spicy shrimp was a tad sloppy and dripping sauce but nonetheless the flavour was definetly worth it . The Baja fish was more fresh in terms of ingredients and was like a taco almost, I thought the sloppy shrimp had more flavour and less fresh ingredients but it's about preference. I enjoyed both very much. 

The atmosphere was absolutely crowded! That's pretty much my only downfall. Too packed, end results, the food is more rushed and not as put together (sloppy like). 
 
Overall I'd Def come back and bring friends but it would have to be in the summer where I can leave with my food and enjoy some elbow room and grub."}
{"text":"Love it. Portions are satisfying, probably 1.5 would be the perfect amount. Food is flavourful. 

I think it's a great little date place not to sit and talk but to share/experience some tasty food together."}
{"text":"Best taco place in the kennsignton market. Affordable and has a variety of flavours. My favourite would be the fish and shrimp taco. Only downfall is that there is not much seating options. You would have to stand around or get take out."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.
Very cheap and perfect taste.
I suggest to everyone who want to eat a very good tacos."}
{"text":"Great Tacos, awesome salsas and most importantly a few cool dudes put music on and making food. Amazing people. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been here so many times. Today they didn't have carnitas so that sucked but they are amazing and the time and the price is legit amazing. Must go."}
{"text":"These are the best fish tacos I've tried in Toronto! Super fresh ingredients, and lots of them. The guacamole is superb. This place gets unbelievably busy at lunch, so try to come early unless you like long lineups"}
{"text":"I've been here many times, especially one summer when I was working nearby at Toronto Western Hospital. It gets pretty busy so expect a line, but so worth it. It only makes it more exciting when you are handed your tacos; two corn tortillas loaded with fish and toppings. The salsas are perfect for adding a little acidity and heat but note that the habanero one is quite spicy! Favourites include the blackened mahi mahi and octopus. $5 might seem steep for a taco but they are pretty sizable and super tasty. 1-2 tacos should be enough for a meal, I think most people would struggle to finish 3. Plus, being in Kensington there other yummy eats to pick up as you walk around!"}
{"text":"Tip:-

Top notch food for the money.

Be prepared to stand in a line anytime of the day during peak meal hours.

Outstanding flavors and great quality.

CASH ONLY!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their baja tacos... at first wasn't sure if ordering one was enough to fill me but trust me the portions are a good size.. even my boyfriend was fairly full after one taco. Will definitely travel to Kensington market again for these! My advice is to go there early as the line up can be long with limited seats."}
{"text":"Small busy place! Only one table that seats 6 and a standing ledge for a few people.

I tried the cactus and cheese and mushroom. I never had cactus before and it reminds me of bitter melon; it's cut into strips and has a soft texture. I'm surprised to find it a little sour.

The tortilla was double lined and has nice flavour, though it got soggy quickly because there's so much filling. There was mushrooms, cilantro, diced tomatoes, onions, lettuce, avocado, and a huge chunk of mozzarella i believe. There's probably sauces and more ingredients but I can't tell what they are. It was messy to eat (like how tacos should be). This is was pretty filling taco for $5. 

This place is okay. It has decent portions and savory tacos. Despite having tried cactus for the first itme, the only thing that stood out for me for this taco was the cheese; I would rather choose a fish or meat taco next time.

I also wish they had a website; it would be nice to see their ingredient list in detail and a overview of who they are & their history as a company."}
{"text":"Delicious but pricey ($5 per taco). Had the shrimp and baja fish. Decent protein portion though, so points for that. Watch how much salsa you put because it's SPICY."}
{"text":"The baja fish tacos are amazing. The tacos are large and will definitely fill you! It's very popular so be prepared to wait a little bit, but it is worth it! My boyfriend loved the gobernador but said the grilled octopus was not something he would get again."}
{"text":"good value, awesome food...needs to get a bigger place!"}
{"text":"Their fish tacos are by far the best ones I've ever had. I enjoy the different spice levels you can add to make every taco exactly how you want it to be. Expect a lineup as this place is very busy and only takes cash."}
{"text":"I really love this place!! My roommate and I frequent this place when we head towards Kensington which is quite often. We love the gobernador, blackened mahi mahi, Baja fish, and the various agua frescas. We have tried the other selections, but these are my favourites."}
{"text":"Delicious food. 
We ordered the mahi mahi, gober, baja, pork, spicy shrimp, two juices/sodas and one watermelon mint juice.

Overall really loved the juice, gober, baja, spicy shrimp and gober. Mahi mahi was good too but a bit too dry.

Took off one star just because of the waiting/crowding/lack of seating."}
{"text":"I woke up and ran 5 miles. I had read about Seven Lives and wanted my first meal of the day to be here. Unfortunately that wound up being around 3 p.m.  I was famished.  The blackened Mahi Mahi taco was the single best taco I've ever eaten, closely followed by the taco that closely followed it, the Camarones a la diabla.  Do. Not. Miss. These. Tacos."}
{"text":"After what seems like forever, I can finally take this off my Yelp bookmarks. Did it live up to expectations, not quite. For whatever reason, I thought it'd be cheaper than it was. Tacos are now $6 each. They're rather large tacos, but they're still not the cheap eat a good taco should be. This place is super busy, even right after opening.  We had the octopus taco and the beef cheek/head taco. Both were good. The octopus was a tad salty, but with the tortilla, it was alright. 

They have one table, and then two bar counters. I'm not sure whether there used to be bar stools for the bar counters, or their bar counters were made for really tall people. I'm 5'4, and I did not enjoy trying to use the counter to eat. I ended up just holding my taco basket in one hand, and my taco in the other. 

I'd say this is a nice taco. Like a gentrified taco. I was hoping more for a street meat kinda taco. Oops. This one was still good, it's not something I'd have every day."}
{"text":"I've heard it's very difficult to catch this place open as Seven Lives supposedly closes shop when they run out of ingredients for the day. Lucky me though, I got to order their grilled octopus taco on a busy early Friday evening!

I love T.O's cheap eats, and this place is no exception. The grilled octopus taco was delicious! Unfortunately, it was difficult to pick the taco up since it got soggy, but eating it with utensils didn't deter from the experience. For the price, you got a good amount of octopus on your taco.

Hopefully, I'll be lucky enough to catch them open the next time I'm in Kensington!"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed my first lunch at 'Seven Lives Tacos'. 

I ordered the Baja Fish Taco and the Blackened Maui Maui Fish Taco. They were topped with fresh pico de gallo, cabbage, guacamole on a fresh flour tortilla.

You could tell these Tacos were made with LOVE ;)

The Tacos were delicious but there were a few draw backs. 

The tacos seemed to lack some flavour. The combination of the fresh toppings and the fish were wonderful but it still lacked in flavor. 

There is very little seating. There is a counter top (for giants) around the side wall and window if you can reach it...

Good Tacos but not the best...

CASH ONLY....."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Toronto in my opinion, (my baseline is Playa Cabana) however there is minimal to non-existent seating so it's a stand and eat or takeout type of joint. Standing and eating takes some extreme skill though as you'll probably get sauce all over yourself if you're a newb.

My favorite is the octopus although every taco is delicious in a different way. Don't forget the 3 hot sauces (hot, med, mild) as that gives some great kick as well. Like most popular places I would suggest going on off hours to try to grab a seat and avoid lineups."}
{"text":"These are completely authentic and extremely delicious.  There is only one other taco place in GTA that is on par and its at Keele and Eglinton.  We have found the quality at both are on par with the best tacos in Mexico and far superior to the average tacos in Mexico.  WE LOVE THESE TACOS!!!!  Ps - there is only very limited room to eat in at a communal table or counter.  Not fine dining, but very delicious and really fun!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a snack and ordered the Baja Tacos which was small for $6, but delicious. 

Always rammed, looooong wait for food and very limited seating, but the staff was nice and the food was good. Just he prepared to wait (no one seemed to mind the waiting)."}
{"text":"Came back here with out of town guests as part of a food tour of Kensington market. We ordered the Gobernador (which like previous visits did not disappoint). We also ordered the Baja fish taco and the Carnita taco. The Baja fish taco was hot, crispy, yet the batter was quite light with the perfect amount of crunch. The pork carnitas was really really good! I was expecting the pork to come shredded but it was nicely grilled meat with a nice slather of guacamole. This experience elevated my rating from 3.5 to 4 stars. Will definitely return!

(85/100)"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of tacos.... And these ones give the others a run for their money! I had the octopus and the Baja fish, both 5$ each so it came to a very inexpensive meal! Small menu so it's easy to pick.. Small place in general so don't count on somewhere to sit if it's busy. 

The octopus was amazing! Very flavourful and cooked perfectly. I will definitely be getting that one again.

The Baja fish was deep fried and had a fresh salsa on top, which made it light and I could have probably eaten 2 or 3 more! 

Definitely recommend if you're nearby, or even if you aren't... Worth a trek out!"}
{"text":"great food, great price. garlic habanero salsa to put on all my tacos. done. Only miss was cash only/debit cards."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco place in Toronto and one of the best tacos I've ever had! I've visited three times now and they are not only delicious, they are super consistent! My favorites are the blackened Mahi Mahi followed by the shrimp and cheese! 
Blackened Mahi is sooooo well seasoned! The taco has a crazy amount of flavor and everything is so well balanced :)! The shrimp and cheese has a great kick of spice and I notice they take the time to clean the shrimp very well - much appreciated. It's cash only but totally worth a trip to an ATM for some tacos! I find two are filling enough but I always opt for three anyways! It's that good."}
{"text":"Made it here as the 7th stop of our 7 restaurant hopping afternoon last night. Made it 30 mins before closing time and it was perfect time to order, eat and catch our breath before getting up again. The tortilla was great, not too greasy but definitely enough good grease lol We got the baja and octopus (they were out of cerviche :( apparently a big seller, next time I'll make it earlier)

Both were great and stuffed to the brim. Their salsas were delicious, the hot is actually hot! It's a serve yourself type of salsa bar with limes and cutlery. I definitely needed the forks because the taco had so much filling I ate half of it before i could close it. 

Not a lot of sitting room (4 seats)but more standing room with wall tables. The staff was friendly and personable. Definitely going back :) Carnitas and cerviche calling my name! They also have good sodas, guava and pineapple flavor."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos at a great price! Winning combo... And the ceviche is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Seven Inches Tacos Y Mariscos is the place I used to run in Toronto, but it went out of business because it was numerically inaccurate, so I'm glad that a similar (but similarly fake) business has popped up in its wake. Owned by Marisco Hargitay, this taco place is in the flowery hipstery awesome Kensington Market, and it could not be any more white if it tried... and it has tried... and found it impossible. 

I got a very very angry private message because I said this place is not Hispanic. I mean, it almost is in a fusion, Americanized, Canadianized, whateverized way. Whether an actual Hispanic person owns it is not the point. People who come here for traditional Mexican food will balk. If they know what it is. Still, if you come here for San Diego style Mexican, or just something tasting good, then maybe it's ok.

What to get: Gubernador (shrimp taco), Fish Taco, Horchata.
What else: Get a beard and some tats, or you won't fit in.

I'd like to give it a 5 based on food alone because the Gubernador, while being nowhere near as good as German Marisco's Truck in San Diego, is really quite yummy. The fish taco is good too, and the Horchata is excellent.

Unfortunately, wait times are insane in a crowded tiny little room, the people that make the food are not Mexican (and it shows), neither are the customers (because who wants to eat food appropriated from your home country's food, but missing the mark in terms of authenticity), and the product... well let's say it's a very good Canadian-ized version of Mexican fish tacos, but not really authentic, and while it is delicious and perhaps worthy of a 5, I prefer authenticity, especially when everyone in their (clueless) reviews is raving about how authentic this stuff is. Sigh. 

And sending me hate mail for my honest appraisal of it too. Sigh again.

You know it's not authentic by the stuff that goes in it, to put it bluntly. The ingredients are fancy, hipster, and gentrified. It's not Mexican. But it's \"inspired by Mexican\" and it's pretty damn good.

The reason it doesn't score 5 is three-fold:

(a) it does bother me that people think it is something it isn't, and rave about its authenticity despite thelack thereof.

But moreso:

(b) the prices are way too high for what you get. There is no way people should be charged this much for a couple of tacos. A Mexican place just wouldn't.

And also:

(c) the service was pretty awful. Hurried, annoyed, unfriendly, business-like. If you're going to charge me this much for faux-Mexican street food, at least be nice about robbing me blind.

All those criticisms aside, it's still really good food and worth trying. Just don't expect authentic. Love it for what it is - an expensive Canadian knock-off - and then maybe it'll be worth it.

Now I've used up seven lives today so I only have two left. You'll have to excuse me. Meow."}
{"text":"All Hail the best taco joint in the Tee Dot!!!!! 
The Baja fish taco is life changing and their nachos are next level. Not a place to visit if you want a nice sit down meal BUT the best food places never are. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of great things before coming here for some great tacos. Seven Lives is quite the hotspot for tacos and is well known in the Kensington Market neighborhood for that eclectic tacos. It's small shop with standing room only and no seating. It's mainly designed for a quick eat and go or takeout food. Make sure you bring cash as they only take cash as method of payment. I got the Gobenador with the Marinated Shrimp and Beef. Tacos are about $6 each and they have different sides that you can add to your meal. For the price you pay, you get a decent portion size and quite the delicious flavorful taco. If you are looking for really really good tacos, this is the place to be at. The HYPE is REAL!!! Now that I know how great their tacos are, I'll definitely be coming back over and over again. Overall, a great taco place and I will be back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Great tacos! I really like the simple and effective menu. 

I haven't eaten many 'legit' tacos before and I must say I am impressed! These are delicious. They were fresh, creamy, and tasty. We ordered the Baja fish/blackened mahi mahi/Gobernador/catch of the day - Haddock. I was doing a food crawl and didn't expect that much food! These are HEFTY tacos (in a good way!)

Notes:
- My ranking of the tacos I ate: Baja fish-mahi mahi-Gobernador-haddock-octopus. I just like the crispiness of the battered fish with my tacos! Haddock was just grilled I think so it was really similar to mahi mahi which was also grilled. 
- The Gobernador was really interesting, the smokiness of the tuna and shrimp adds a whole level of flavour. 
- There's also unlimited salsa, which is awesome!
- Double tortillas ensures firm tacos which means it's not all falling apart on you. Plus!

The place is pretty difficult to find in the dark but it was a small blue coloured place. Came here on a Saturday evening and there were a couple of people here all occupying the tables/ledge. Fortunately this is more 'fast-food' in the sense people just grab a bite and eat it fairly quickly so we managed to do the same. 

EDIT: Didn't expect to come here twice in a short period but I ordered the ceviche and the octopus taco right before closing. They were okay, wasn't anything special although the octopus was nicely spiced and tender. The ceviche was light and was a nice change, there was a very generous portion! The fried tortillas were definitely sitting there for a while as they were coldish and had a faded fried look."}
{"text":"Overall, the tacos were really well made - I was super full after having two of the three tacos that I ordered and I was struggling to finish the third. 

The best taco of the three that I had was definitely the Carnita - the pulled pork was tender and was melt in your mouth good! I wish I could say the same about the blackened mahi mahi and the baja fish tacos. I found the blackened mahi mahi to be way too salty for my liking. The baja fish was also salty. I was a bit disappointed because everyone who has ever been to Seven Lives has always raved about how amazing it is and I've been wanting to go there for the longest time. I did end up picking out some of the meat so that everything else that was in the tacos countered the saltiness of the fish and they ended up tasting a bit better (sad that I had to get rid of some of the meat). 

Despite the salty fish tacos, the tacos, as a whole, were really filling and will put you in a bit of a food coma if you have had too much of them! I look forward to coming back again and trying out other items on the menu. Hopefully the tacos that I'll be getting won't be too salty on me."}
{"text":"Returned here for my first time in a few years and have to say I was disappointed. Still a very long wait but the end result was not what I remember. 

I ordered two tacos the octopus and the spicy pork and pineapple.  Like everyone has pointed out the tacos  are large so it was definitely enough to satisfy. The quality of the toppings however has decreased.  The octopus chunks were small and not very tender.  There didn't seem to be much else on the taco. The pork was a similar texture and there wasn't much in the way of additional interesting toppings like there used to be. The tortillas themselves were pretty average. 

I'll give them another chance to see if they can get back up to a four or five star but will definitely go with a different order."}
{"text":"First thoughts before ordering: Wow, two tacos for $10. This seems kind of pricy, but okay...

First thoughts after eating: I can't believe they packed all of that food into two sets of tortillas.

There's usually a line that goes out the door at Seven Lives and it's justified (unless you have a short lunch break). The seafood tastes fresh and the food is full of flavor. There are a lot of competing restaurants in Kensington Market, and Seven Lives ranks among the best of them.

My only issue is that there's nowhere to really eat inside during a rush, but holding your other tacos while eating is great for your core."}
{"text":"OMG Taco Tuesday was taken to whole new levels, I think ti also takes debit, but the 5.00 per option is correct. It was great had the baja (crispy goodness with a huge amount of topping and very big piece of fish) and the blackened mahi mahi. Blackened is not often my thing but the guac sold me and it was so worth it. The thing was so large I was worried I'd gotten guac in my bangs. No joke! These are huge for the price and filling. Not to mention amazing. Go during the week to reduce the wait, or go and wait and still be happy."}
{"text":"What you see is what you get. Great Mexican Tacos, tostadas and ceviche. Fantastic food, flavours and value!!"}
{"text":"One star down for running out of carnitas around dinner time :( Baja fish was still quality though so I'm not that disappointed. They were actually open this time and did not run out of ingredients. I tried to go twice last time and they were closed before their closing time.

Anyways, this is one of my go to spots for tacos. Affordable and delicious. Baja fish does not have an after taste, no fishy smell, nicely deep fried, and a hefty portion with the green garnishes."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon and there was a line waiting outside. It wasn't too long a wait though - maybe 15-20 minutes. Reviews say to get the Baja fish or octopus. I ended up choosing the octopus even though I wanted to try both (but I wasn't that hungry and was saving room for ice cream after).

The octopus was REALLY good - definitely one of the best tacos I've had. All their tacos cost $5 each and they also have ceviche, poke and chips, and more. My friend (who's a Toronto native) says this is one of the top 3 taco places in Toronto and I believe her! I'd love to come back again and try their Baja fish taco and ceviche."}
{"text":"It's not often I'm blown away by Mexican food, but I went back here TWICE in ONE week, which says a lot about how much I enjoyed the food!

The place is REALLY small, so be prepared to wait in line - but it is worth it!
Try a variety of their tacos; they are all very fresh and piping hot, and you can add 3 different sauces on them...the hot sauce is REALLY hot so don't pile your taco with it like I did! (My tongue burnt after for the entire day)! 

Their agua frescas are also delicious, I tried the pineapple one. 

Can't wait to be back next time!"}
{"text":"The line was out the door from 3-4pm on a Monday. We tried to wait it out but eventually decided to join the line.

We got the grilled octopus, gobernador, and the catch of the day. They were all great but I especially loved the cheese and flavors in the gobernador. I usually don't like charred food but the fish was better than i expected as well.

Each taco was filled very generously and grilled perfectly--it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"My all time favourite taco place! For $6 you get a fairly good sized taco, 2 make a meal for me. My favourites are the gobernador (smoked tuna, shrimp and cheese) and the baja fish. They also do fantastic vegetarian tacos, I've had both the cactus and the corn. The only one I wasn't a fan of was the octopus. The ingredients are fresh and flavourful and they often fill the toppings up so high I have to eat some of it with a fork first!

There isn't a lot of space to sit inside as its a very tiny shop so I usually stand outside to eat or get them to go. If you come during peak times, be prepared to wait atleast half an hour. This would be the best place to get drunk food but sadly they close pretty early (8pm)."}
{"text":"THE BEST TACOS

This place is always busy with a line out the door with very little seating inside and a few standing spots. Get ready to eat with very little elbow room and no place to put your jacket or bag. While others hover around for your standing area with sauce all over your hands. But its worth it. It also has a very \"toronto\" vibe located in the awesome area of kensington market, it feels local, with an eclectic mix of hipsters, kids in strollers and yuppies coming here. 

The Gobernador has so much stuff - shrimps, tuna and cheese - whats not to like. And double corn tortillas are the only way to go if you're gonna do tacos right. Their ceviche is tangy and the portion is large, a small mountain of mixed seafood with lots of lime juice and onions with a tostada hat. They also have a hot sauce / salsa bar - DELISH! 

Wash it all down with their daily aqua fresca (the day I was there it was cantaloupe) sweet and refreshing with the meal."}
{"text":"The good: 
- cheap tacos that are stuffed with goodness
- variable flavours and creativity in their dishes
- gluten free if you want it
- fresh, hot and right to order
- two is a huge meal

The bad: 
- usually a huge, noisy, zoo of a line up
- nowhere to sit (but hey, who can blame them, their rent is cheap which keeps the tacos cheap)
- their ceviche -- it's just not very flavorful or interesting

Avoid the mexican sodas if you're not into super sweet things because they're way sweeter than Canadian/American soft drinks."}
{"text":"Not sure if they changed owner or not, but I was a bit disappointed after yesterday's visit. The menu got changed, I don't see the blacken fish or mahi  mahi on the menu anymore. It's now seems like an Asian own restaurant, all workers are Asian. Last time when I went, my taco was filled with big chunk of guacamole , didn't get that at all this time. Maybe it's a cost saving thing? But I feel the quality goes down and wasn't lift up to my expectation anymore."}
{"text":"I have to say I've had better at Playa Cabana, la Carnitas and Grand Electric. Perhaps the only thing where Seven Lives beats the others is the serving size. I was stuffed after eating two tacos from here but I definitely needed more at other places."}
{"text":"We ate here when visiting Toronto, and let me tell you these tacos are some of the BEST I have ever had. 
We went here on a Sunday and Kensington Market was packed. The food, however, is worth the wait (15 minutes).  

The dining area inside is tiny, so you can either get your food to go, or do some people watching at the counters that face outside. 

Some recommendations: 
Baja Fish Tacos! 
Mahi Tacos
Pork Tacos 

They only accept CASH so be prepared! Expect to pay $4-$5 per taco. They are stuffed and very filling and are worth the $$ you pay. Kensington Market is wonderful, and food places like Seven Lives are a big reason why."}
{"text":"The greatest taco place. People will talk about grand electric, carnita, Wilbur, don't listen to them. If you want a taco in Toronto this is the place to get it. It's fresh, the sauces are amazing, and everything on the menu is phenomenal. I'm a huge fan of the baja and the blackened mahi mahi."}
{"text":"THE BEST TACO'S IN TOWN! Plus taco's are $4-6 each and full of good stuff! (recommendations: baja fish taco or pork carnitas and if they have it, cucumber watermelon juice made in-house)"}

I had eaten tacos from another store in the area and was feeling pretty full, but after seeing how high the reviews were I had to make a stop and take a look at what it was that made this place so good. I was definitely not disappointed.

We had the gobernador, the Baja fish taco, and the grilled octopus. Out of all these I enjoyed the octopus the most. The flavours were the best out of the three and the texture of the octopus was just right. The Baja fish taco was crisp and lightly battered. The Gobernador, was my least favourite of the three, but still much better than other fish tacos.

Having not much space to eat was the main drawback for not going to this place first, but the food definitely makes it worthwhile to go. 

In spite of being one of the last customers of the day (sorry), they were still polite and friendly. I was more than satisfied with the service.

I would recommend this place as one of the best taco shops in all of Toronto."}
{"text":"Although they always recommend the gobenador (pronounced: go-ben-a-door) I always get the blackened mahi mahi. Also, if you're into octopus get the taco with the octopus. 

If they say something is spicy and you don't have a tolerance for spicy things, stay away. It'll be spicy. My sister eats chilis with lots of things and it was spicy for her so she needed me to go back in to ask for water (which I didn't mind because it gave me an excuse to go back in. He even remembered my name when I came back in!!!)

I just wish it wasn't cash only and had more seating...but you know...you can't have it all."}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times and was never a disappointment!
Although the space is small and always packed, it's worth the wait if you've never tried it before"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! All of it. This place offers 3 small tables, so don't expect to be able to sit down. Their tacos are small, but very flavourful. Ingredients are well marinated and fresh. This is a fast food joint. One of the best in the city. If you love tacos, you have to come here."}
{"text":"Tried the Gob and Blackened Mahi Mahi, both were amazing but the mahi mahi was definitely the favourite. 
Watch out though, the tacos are messy to eat and seating is very limited!
For $6/ taco, portions were not extremely large but it was definitely delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos de carnitas, the best I've tried in T.O 

The camarones a la diabla are really great, spicy for those who are not used to spice! 

The tostada de ceviche it's fresh and big 

I ate one of each and was really really full."}
{"text":"Baja fish taco speaks to me. I only need to eat 2 tacos to call it a day. Great portions and price!"}
{"text":"Tiny, tiny place with one take and stand-up dining, this pace offers great tacos. With options of fish & meat tacos. We had the Blackened grilled Mahi Mahi, fried fish tacos, Gobenator.

The deep fried fish taco was so delicious. I added a little bit of mild sauce on the taco and it was a jammed packed hearty and fresh taco. They don't go cheap on toppings here at all. In fact, they use two small soft shell tortillas to support them.

The Blackened Mahi Mahi is delicious with raw onions, guacamole and tomatoes. The fish is fresh and juicy and my second favorite.

The Gobenator filled with shrimp and tons of veggies as toppings. It's more savory and very filling. My third favorite, but still good.

The reason this gets a 3* and not 5* is because 1) they have no washroom, which is a shame, since you're eating with your hands. Also, by law, you're supposed to allow customers to use your bathroom. Saying you \"don't have one\" is a lie.

Our server also was in la-la-land and wasn't really paying attention when we were asking about the tacos l tacos favorite. We had to repeat ourselves 3 times as she stared out the window. Really weird."}
{"text":"The fish taco was great and I loved all the toppings, esp the pickled onions. There is usually a line but it goes fast.  Not much room to sit, but it takes no time to devour.  We crowded around a small table and made it work."}
{"text":"Tacos were large and quite tasty but worth the sweaty summer wait with no space to sit? Ehh

We arrived 10 minutes before opening on Thursday and there was already a line forming. Tacos are 5 bucks each which is pretty expensive but they are quite stuffed so for a girl like me, makes a filling lunch. 

My boyfriend got the Baja fish and octopus and I got the carnitas and the shrimp/tuna tacos. My carnitas taco was great, I had to fork up some filling in the beginning so I can eat the taco with my hands. The salsas and the veggies taste so fresh and complemented the tacos perfectly. I'm not a huge fish fan but I also enjoyed the shrimp and tuna taco. It was pretty indulgent with the cheese but I would've preferred less sour cream.

Warning...the octopus taco is very very spicy and I'm no wimp to spicy food. I was kind of put off that the description didn't even say it was spicy but I was at the point of almost tears trying to get over the fire in my mouth. I had to chug most of the water bottle.

I wouldn't say this is a must have for my next Toronto Vacay"}
{"text":"First time here, had the Gobernador, Baja fish & Carnitas($5 each), all were amazing and delicious. Very limited seating(one table for 6 inside and a couple of small tables outside so prepared to stand & eat. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Finally got to try out possibly the best tacos in town. I tried three different types: shrimp & cheese, fish, and spicy chicken. First of all, $6/taco may sound pricey compared to other places (considering this is not a dine-in resto). Tacos are big I could only eat 2. I can usually finish 3 or 4 tacos easily. Generous amounts of proteins and other garnishes. You can also fix your tacos with three different salsa and fresh lime wedges. I loved all the tacos I tried. My fave was shrimp and cheese. 

-Food: very good 
-Service: friendly and quick
-CASH ONLY
-Highly recommend take-out (one table for six and a bar that can fit six people, but you can only stand)
-Be prepared to get your hands dirty (they have wipes)
-Long Lineup"}
{"text":"Minimal seating
Had baja fish tacos 
Best tacos downtown that I've eaten so far
Price was fair
Cash only"}
{"text":"My sister and I were craving some tacos and Seven Lives was rated pretty high. I'm super pick about what tacos I get and my favorite kind of taco is anything with fish on it. The pictures on yelp and reviews convinced me to give this show a try. Seven lives is located in sort of the hipster part of Tonronto. It's a super small location so it's hard getting a seat since there's only 1 table and a few standing room space. I managed to get the bench outside. There's also a line at this place but it goes by pretty quick. All the ingredients they use are local and fresh so they charge $6 for a taco. Kind of expensive but they give you a big portion! I was actually pretty full from it. I wish they had smaller tacos and charge less for it because I would get more tacos. I would recommend the baja tacos they're delicious! My sister got the al pastor which came with a big chunk of pineapple. The tacos were really good and if your'e in the neighborhood you should definitely go there! Even if it's our of your way I would come here! They are also cash only so be prepared!!"}
{"text":"Long line-ups, crowded small downtown street (do not recommend driving there!)... but all for fresh, (very affordable) and Really yummy tacos. They do sell out of menu items, so getting there earlier in the day is probably a better idea if one wants more choice. 
Staff work so hard, non-stop, just wanted to say Thank You! Stay awesome"}
{"text":"Really good taco's but a little expensive. $5 dollars at taco seems like a decent price but your going to need at least three to be satisfied. I tried 3 different tacos and only the baja fish would I say is amazing and a must try."}
{"text":"Back for more (third time now I think?), and it's all fish taco this time around..  Perfect as always, and holy carp, have they increased the size of the fish itself?  I can't go below 5 stars on this.  Still my fav taco place in TO."}
{"text":"Messy Tacos...ya i said it and you thought it too lol This place is wicked!  Love the open kitchen so you see how the gears work and they work well.  

Got the Octopus and Baja tacos along with a Mexican cola.  It was really messy but I love that.  

Will be back many times.  Great job guys!"}
{"text":"This is definitely as good as it gets when it comes to tacos.... and I've eaten a lot of tacos in my day. Be prepared to wait however if you visit at peak times - it is a very small place. Also note that there isn't much room to sit and eat inside. The Gobernador is definitely a must-try! it's my Go-To taco every time. Great excuse to walk the streets of Kensington Market while you're there."}
{"text":"Can I just say that Seven Lives made my whole Kensington Market trip worth it . Baja Fish is the crowd favorite but fish not really being my thing I thought the Al Pastor was the Best ever !"}
{"text":"Recommendation: 

+(1/2) Price vs Portion: You will need 2 tacos which run at more than 10$

+1 Taste: More meats and flavour than other taco places

+1 Comfortable place to eat: Cool vibe"}
{"text":"While I enjoyed the tacos it was at as amazing as the reviews made them out to be. One was too salty (blackened something something) but the shrimp one was on point. They were large and very filling. Downside is it's a small joint, and when it gets crowded there is no where to stand, never mind to eat. That could be a bit frustrating. Luckily, my experience was we found ourself a little corner by the trash to eat.

Cash only. And no atms near by so be ready."}
{"text":"I created an account on this website to review this place.

I had been on here to read about what to expect from these tacos and all I heard were good things (for the most part). I absolutely hate hyping places up and finally after weeks of saying \"I am going to check this place out\" and then being severely disappointed. Hoping that I had not over-hyped another joint via reviews and expectation, I finally made it out. Not this place. The tacos were absolutely angelic; I had the Gobernador (smoked marlin taco) and the Baja fish taco (and at a later date, the Octopus taco), all of which were easily some of the most delicious pieces of food that have ever entered my buccal cavity. The salsas on the side were a nice touch and at $5 a piece you will be hard pressed to find a better deal for something so delicious. 

Go there ASAP."}
{"text":"This place has excellent fish tacos. There isn't much seating and it gets packed on the weekend. No booze. I feel like they should move their table at busy times or just get rid of it, as the table just amplifies the weekend clusterfuckedness."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in the city as far as I am
Concerned. They recently upped their prices but still worth it imo. Come early and with time as it is a small place with minimal seating and lineups in the summer time. 5/5 Cash only be prepared"}
{"text":"Really, there's nothing I can say that 380 other rave reviews haven't already said.
I'm only writing this review because I feel like I owe it to the establishment for the many fantastic tacos I've had at this place."}
{"text":"Fresh, substantial, flavourful, consistent. Best tacos in the city. Just go. And bring cash. And check their hours first."}
{"text":"Only problem is they close way too early, no space to sit, and cash only.

Love the pork, blackened mahi mahi, deep fried fish taco. Portions are huge. Get em!!"}
{"text":"ONLY TAKES CASH. When you give USD, they only offer 1 CAD to 1USD. I think thats a total wrip off..."}
{"text":"i felt so pricy
just one taco for 5 dallas

but yeah it was delicious
(i ordered first one of the menu board)"}
{"text":"Not the typical Mexican taco joint: Seven Lives serves up tacos with unique fillings like octopus, beef cheek and corn smut. Don't knock it if you haven't tried it, being adventurous will bring you delicious rewards.

WE SHARED:
Camarones A La Diablo - generous amount of bouncy, meaty shrimp swimming in a medium spicy sauce and crema: a tasty start.

Cuitlacoche (corn smut, black beans and cheese) - The flavor was over powering. I enjoyed it more scooping it up in small amounts with the chips. Hubby said it would taste better paired with meat. We paired it with the beef cheek and head meat and scooped it up with the chips: hubby was right, YUM!

Cabeza (beef cheek, head meat, grilled onions, guac and cilantro) - The meat was tender with pieces of fat scattered about: pretty good.

Pulpo (grilled octopus with celery) - Tender with a slight chew to it, some bits had char. The celery threw off the taste so I picked it all out. Would have tasted better with some salsa but they didn't have any take out containers for them.

Gobernador (grilled marlin, shrimp and cheese) - seafood was good, it had a sweet and smoky sauce.

Pricey street tacos (hey, I'm from California) but at least they're stuffed to the point where you'll probably need a fork to scoop up the filling that spills out of the ends.

They have one nice wooden table with benches by the window that can seat 4-6 people and also skinny bar tables along the walls where you can stand and eat. The person taking the orders was so disinterested and looked liked she didn't want to be there. Best for take out orders as you tour Kensington Market."}
{"text":"I came here a little past noon on a Friday and this place was packed! The storefront is a pretty small area, so when you cram in a small tables, a couple of chairs and long line-ups, it is really crowded here. Reading the Yelp reviews prior to coming set the bar very high, but unfortunately, I was definitely disappointed. 

I ordered a Baja fish taco and a grilled octopus taco while my friend got one Gobernador and one cactus and mushroom with grilled cheese. While they were very flavourful, the tacos themselves were soggy and in my opinion, there were way too many toppings which made them a mess to eat. The batter on the Baja fish was pretty soggy as well and the octopus definitely felt way overcooked and too rubbery. The Gobernador was apparently okay, but the cactus and mushroom, again was a disappointment. The cactus and mushroom taco comes with guacamole, which is not listed in their menu - so if you don't like guac, make sure you know the cactus/mushroom one comes with quite a lot of guac on top of it.

People typically get 2 tacos for a lunch, which would come to $9 or $10 + tax (all tacos are $5, the cactus and mushroom one is $4). $5 for one taco seems a bit on the pricey side in my opinion. Also they only accept cash!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I still haven't gotten tired of this place. These are the best tacos in Toronto- better than Wilbur Mexicana, Grand Electric, you name it. 

The space is tiny so be prepared to stand and eat or find another bench in Kensington to sit on, but the tacos are well worth it.

My favorites are the Gobernador and Carnitas. Yum!"}
{"text":"On taste alone this place is fantastic. However there are like so many taco places now that you gotta compare the whole package.

It's a place you can come in the summer, takeout cause there aren't many seats.

They are quite quick to provide the tacos, they are overstuffed to the max. But I found it tough to hold onto and eat as a result.

Definitely get the gobernator, it's definitely the best. I'd skip the mushroom-cheese one, unless you are vegetarian of course.

The seating is limited, so you gotta fight or stand behind seated folks to get a seat."}
{"text":"Very, very favourable tacos. Even though the line is always long and the store is almost claustrophobic, it is pretty worth it. There's nowhere to sit and I basically chugged down my water after a few bites because I wasn't ready for the spiciness of my tacos. I'd love if they put on the menu which tacos had spice to them; I'm a fan, would just like forewarnings! Minus one star for the small space and lack of more detailed descriptions."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos.  I got the catch of the day and the carnita.  Tacos are $5 each which is a little pricey for the size but very filling and tasty.  They ran out of ceviche and said to come earlier next time (I was there at 7pm).  Orders take about 10-15 minutes  (they were pretty busy) but it's worth the wait.  Be careful with the hottest hot sauce, it almost blew my face off.   Love the simplicity of the menu.  Any more items and you venture beyond the capacity and scope of the restaurant.  Very friendly staff.  I'll be back for ceviche!"}
{"text":"It is good but overrated!

Cash only, limited seats, huge lines, dark and cave like atmosphere. These are Taco's and they are good, just not good enough to get past the first 4 points."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Go here!

My favorite is the spicy shrimp and cheese taco, but the others I had were also good and filled with sauce. You do not come here to sit down, as there are only a few seats and it's not comfortable. This place serves 5 dollar tacos, I got about 4 - 5 which was too much. I think 3 is perfect. Anyways, I am giving this place 4.5 stars because everything is great, food and service is quick. They are very busy. It would be nice if they can some how expand and have normal seating."}
{"text":"I had the best baja fish taco of my life here! And I get fish tacos everywhere. It was so flavourful and delicious and was very filling. 
I had an octopus taco too, which was pretty good. I also tried a bite of the spicy shrimp taco and this was amazinggg. I will definitely be returning for more! Yummm"}
{"text":"FINALLY came around to seven lives - now i can stop thinking about their fish taco! i usually just go elsewhere that's more convenient since Kensington is a bit out of the way for me. i had heard that they have the best tacos in the city but now i truly understand.

i ordered their baja taco and they immediately made it fresh, took around 10 mins. i appreciate that they layered the tortilla - the fish was perfectly fried and crispy, a good portion but a bit too much batter in my option. however, overall it was so delicious! i LOVED that they had the perfect about of coleslaw, some tacos have too much, but it was a great ratio - adding the perfect crunch! their salsa had the right amount of heat and flavour! i can eat very hot, so i very much wanted to take the hot one home with me! the taco is $6 AND it's a big taco not a tiny little 2 bite taco, so definitely worth it. the prices of other taco joints in the city are pretty much the same for much smaller! my only wish was that they were a bigger joint and they had more space for dining it - but again, not a big deal and not their concept. i very much enjoyed my taco and can't wait to be back for more baja!"}
{"text":"I never had much enthusiasm for tacos in the city, especially when it and other Mexican/Latin American food became trendy in town as of late. And I know next to nothing about fish tacos. This is Toronto damnit, not California nor Mexico! Yet somehow I have developed a habit of stopping by Seven Lives after a cheap Chinatown haircut.

This is a tiny-ass takeout taqueria in Kensington Market, with one table inside, some bar seats along a window, and a couple more tables outside. On a typical day, the number of people lining up to place or pick up an order far exceeds how many are dining in, and you thought your streetcar ride was bad. Despite the sardine crowds and a long wait time, this place still manages to churn out grub efficiently, with a turnaround time I find quicker than many busy trendy food trucks I've seen in a foodie festival. Decide what you want, they take your name and you wait 'til you're called. Hello? Is it me you're looking for? I can see it in your eyes...

Awaiting crowds can always pass the time for their fresh  made-to-order meal to be ready by watching the kitchen staff at work in the tiny kitchen behind the counter. It's like theatre.

The constant crowds aren't here for no reason. The popularity of their Baja style fish tacos speak for themselves, especially when you find that even two or one taco is filling enough, and each can be had for $5 each. Five bucks or less for anything decent to eat in this city is getting rare.

The 'gobernator', which comes with shrimp and smoked tuna, is a popular choice. As is the Baja fried fish. They stuff those tortillas with a liberal dose of seafood, guacamole and other fresh fillings, and it goes into your mouth with a stuffed, fresh yummy finish with little fish aftertaste. Help yourself with a liberal dose of their three hot salsa sauces on the counter while you're still here.

Hell, as someone whose only other major taco experience is a Taco Bell years ago (or that halfassed attempt at homemade tacos via a free Old El Paso kit), enjoying a Seven Lives taco feels like upgrading from being a landing gear wheelwell stowaway to sitting in business class on a flight to Mexico. But this is ultimately street food we're talking about, yes?

Their ceviche ($7), pretty decent too, and is served with a corn tortilla chip. As is also the drinks they have from that counter jug for $2 a serving. Be sure to serve them cash only.

{TTC: 505 streetcar to Spadina or the 510 to Nassau. Then in typical Kensington Market fashion, determine how to reach Kensington Ave at Baldwin St.}"}
{"text":"The tacos taste so good. I love it there. I also love their spicy salsa. Its very hot so i make sure not to spread too much. I love their gobernator and their baja fish. Their lemonade is amazing too. You can tell its freshly squeezed lemonade-or at least it tastes like it. The only thing about seven lives is that they only accept cash which in my opinion is a but of a pain because i hardly carry cash. But Over all its great!"}
{"text":"Had their grilled octopus taco. It was all right. Nothing special. But the hot sauce! It was quite hot! Loved it. Will definitely go there again to try their other items."}
{"text":"Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos is located in Kensington Market (mini outdoor district with food and vintage shops) and specializes in Southern California style Mexican food. Sometimes I even question why I flew all the way to Toronto to try something I can get back home, but hey I can never get sick of eating tacos and this shop is one of the more popular food options in Kensington Market.

This is a really small taco shop with few long pub tables. The chances are you will have to stand while you are eating your tacos. Each taco isn't exactly cheap - CAD $6 PLUS tax (about USD $4.75) and there are 9 different taco options to choose from. Their tiny salsa bar is right next to the cashier counter and salsas weren't exactly memorable.

***

Baja Fish (fried haddock; CAD $6) and Gobernador (smoked marlin, shrimp & cheese; CAD $6): Two tacos were enough to fill me up. Each taco came with double layered corn tortilla. Baja Fish was definitely better than Gobernador and I can see why Baja Fish is on Yelp's review highlights. Not the best Baja fish taco, but it was lightly battered and tasted pretty good. On the other hand, I wasn't too impressed with Gobernador and it tasted somewhat bland.

***

Yes there are much better taco shops in Los Angeles (e.g. Tacos Baja in East LA, Ricky's Fish Tacos, Guisados, etc), but I would still recommend Baja Fish taco and I wouldn't mind re-visiting this place if I actually live in Toronto. A solid 3.5-star."}
{"text":"These were the best tacos I've had in North America. We've been to reportedly the best places in Santa Barbara and San Diego and the seafood versions here still topped the list - particularly the grilled octopus and the spicy tuna, shrimp and cheese tacos."}
{"text":"I ordered the gobernador taco and it costed $5 + tax. I know $5 for one taco might seem really expensive, but it's actually very filling and tasty. I only ate one taco but felt very full afterwards so don't worry, you're getting your money's worth. The tacos are a little messy because they really fill them up, so if you can find a table or a bench to eat at that would be best. Otherwise get a fork - you're gonna need it.

Definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for some tacos but don't know where to go."}
{"text":"Every time I look at this picture I crave it.

Got one Camarones a la Diabla. Double layering the taco = smart choice, balances out the dough with the large amount of topping. Beware the spicy salsa is actually quite spicy. Shrimp was super flavourful and the cheese was a great touch. Price was kinda steep for the portion size but it's WORTH.

Lines are always very long for good reason. I rarely visit Kensington Market but I'll definitely be trying more from this place whenever I come."}
{"text":"Best taco place in Toronto hands down! No argument. Baja fish and pulpo tacos are amazing, although you can't go wrong with any of them. Also worth trying are the poke nachos, which come with sizeable chunks of fresh salmon. Can get really crowded so best to grab takeout."}
{"text":"If you like fish tacos, you have to come here. Even if you don't, you should probably give it a try, because their food is AMAZING.

Honestly I don't remember what I got. It had grilled fish, pineapple, and avocado and it was amazing. Everything was super fresh and you can taste it. The flavours meshed so well together. 

I think about coming back here at least a few times a week, but it's so darn far. There is always a line up and/or a huge crowd of people waiting for food, no reservations, only one table for sitting. 

$5 a taco, the habanero sauce is legit spicy and might leave burns on your insides. Just kidding, but come eat here. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Been here twice within 2 months. The sign is a little obscure as we almost missed it the first time. The tacos were sooo good we want to come back everytime we go to downtown. Tried the gobernator, baja fish, pulled pork, halibut, all good. The spiciest sauce was very spicy the fist time we tried. Sweat was coming off the back of the head... but the second time tasted milder..."}
{"text":"I went here last summer.  Sure the tacos are fine.  But I didn't see the big deal of them.  The lineup is stupid.  You eat standing up like a savage.  This is yet another prime example of over hype.  It's a taco people!  So many better options out there and you don't have to eat standing!  If you want that experience go to the subway at 9am and bring your breakfast burrito and eat it while you whiff the armpits and farts of the people next to you."}
{"text":"Had the cactus taco, super sour. Not to my taste. Very busy on weekends, no place to sit. I don't think it's worth the hype."}
{"text":"Amazing baja fish tacos! The fried fish was light and a really tasty dressing on top!"}
{"text":"Oh my yum, my boss just brought these tacos in for my team for lunch and holy heck let me just say these tacos are AMAZING! My review is based solely on my consumption of the fried mahi mahi taco and the reactions of my colleagues, which were rather expressive. 

The mahi mahi was the perfect consistency and texture - firm and flaky, and full of flavour without tasting fishy. To be honest, I had never really had fish tacos before this and I am now officially on team fish taco. Sign me up. This is a winning team. World series here I come.

I'm not actually sure how much these tacos cost but apparently they're quite affordable. Regardless, I know next time I'm in kensington I'll find it impossible to walk past Seven Lives without grabbing me a mahi mahi. Folks say that's not even the best thing on the menu, but I don't even know how I'll try anything else when the mahi mahi was so yummy yummy."}
{"text":"Wow... i was very impressed.  Only $5.... I loved the Gobernador... The Mahi Mahi was tasty but Gobernador was tops... lots of shrimps on pulled pork... mmmmmm... can't wait to go back... :)"}
{"text":"Excellent taco stand with great food to go along with good prices and service.  I found about this place from an article on Blog.To.   I had the Baja fish haddock tacos and they were among the best tacos I had anywhere, and that includes those made in Texas or California.    

There is very limited seating and it is cash only.    But I am not going to let that cost them a five-star review by making Seven Lives out to be something that it is not.    I would strongly suggest this establishment if you are craving for tacos, enough said."}
{"text":"Probably my fav taco place in toronto so far! Got the baja fish taco and it was a pretty decent size. The fish was super crispy and the flavours went really well together. Wish there was more seating (there was literally one table) and had AC, but other than that their tacos are amazing"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this gem almost on accident after going to Kensington Market and desperately needed a place to eat. After finding Seven Lives on Yelp, I decided to try it with a friend and I was blown away. I ordered the Baja Fish Taco and I can easily say that this was one of the best fish taco I've ever had (certainly in Canada). The fish was perfectly fried and the toppings were so well done, really aesthetic as well if you're interested in photos (check out the photo I uploaded on Yelp). The menu consists of all fish tacos and has a range of options, as well as salsas to top the taco with.

The restaurant is quite small and as such, not much seating and always crowded. I personally took the taco to go and ate it while walking around Kensington, which is a great hang out idea on a nice day. The tacos took awhile to cook but again I think it was worth it, as you can tell they really put the time into every taco they make and theres usually a number of people waiting for their food as well. While the price may seem expensive (~$6), the taco was quite filling and quality is very high, so its well worth the price.

5/5. This is a must try in Kensington Market."}
{"text":"What a hot place!!!!! There are full of crazy people and hot sauce. Everyone came here, wait for more than 15 minutes just for a tacos. Can u imagine how the little restaurant can be too crowded to find a place to stand? Just go to Seven Lives to check it.

I was a little full when walked in because I had  take a small portion of Jerk chicken in the Rasta not far away from the Seven lives. The friendly stuff recommended me the Garbonator Tacos. It was so great!! There are smoked tuna and spice shrimps in only five dollars! The medium sauce was the best for the tacos since it already very hot.

 Ohh!! Don't forget to try the juice they provided!! I personally prefer to papaya than cucumber but it all depend on your own taste. The iced and fresh juice with a hot tacos would be a best meal~~

Definitely go back and try some other flavors~"}
{"text":"This place is worth the line up! I come here every time when I'm in Kensington. Try the baja fish and fish of the day ones. It seems expensive but every taco is filled with content. The sauce and complementary vegetables they use are different for each fish/meat so each flavour tastes very different. 

Be careful about their salsa/hot sauce because some of them are painfully spicy."}
{"text":"Always packed without enough sittings inside. But packed because they are good.
Tried the Baja fish and Carnitas. Pretty good I would say.
The only complain I have is the door doesn't stay close by itself. And people eating there have to constantly get up and close the door whenever people walks through it.
Summer will be better I guess."}
{"text":"I can't say I'm too cultured in Mexican food but this is my number one place to go for that (none of that Taco Bell quality). 

The food is actually really filling, but it is a bit of a small portion. Nonetheless, the flavor pops and the smell makes you drool. 

Gabinator: I actually have no clue what was in here. Shrimp? Sauce? Stuff? It's just beautiful and its a mouthful. 

Baja Fish: Essentially the fish of fish and chips wrapped in a nice hot soft taco shell. 

If you plan to come here, COME BEFORE RUSH HOUR. There isn't really much room to sit, but it's a really good place nonetheless. 

Each taco is $5 AND TRY THE HOT SAUCE."}
{"text":"I've had Seven Lives Taco bookmarked for the longest time and wanted to try it out since I have read many great reviews!

Came here on a Sunday afternoon, was expecting the place to be packed and fill because of all the great reviews. Surprisingly it wasn't as bad as I thought, there were a couple of people waiting for their food and just 2 customers ahead of us in line.  The menu was very condensed, not too much to choose from (which is great, so I don't have to hold up the line) but enough for me to decide which one I wanted to try first. 

The cashier was super nice and friendly, greeted us as we walked up to the cash register. We ordered what we wanted then stepped to the side and waited for our order. We got the Gobernardor as well as one of their daily squeezed juices, mango/orange. They make fresh juices everyday and oh yea, you can tell it's home made as soon as you take the first sip!

The wait wasn't too long for a taco, less than 10 mins, since they make it fresh right when you order it! As you pick up your taco, you can choose to add hot sauce to it, they're home made in smaller bowls, each labelled the spiciness of each and what type of hot peppers they contain. I tried the mild as well as the medium sauce, it was amazing! The spiciness of the mild was just a little tingy giving you a tiny kick as you eat your taco, the medium was a little bit more leaving your tongue a little after effect for a couple of mins. 

The taco we got was big and filling! Although it didn't look a lot of food, but it is filling for one person if your not a big eater. The taco was saucy at the bottom, filled with smoked tuna and other toppings, then lastly topped with 4 shrimps (the sizes of the shrimps were not small at all).

I would definitely come back again to try other tacos which they serve! Also, each taco costs only $5 which I find a good worth of your money and fresh drinks are only $2 each! Looking forward to coming back and trying other tacos on their menu."}
{"text":"I might be the only person to meh this place, but meh. Not great for veg options, and I disliked the gobernador. can't speak for the other tacos."}
{"text":"Baja fish taco and shrimp/pork were good, the octopus one was weird. High quality but a bit slow as its a busy place. Not much seating room"}
{"text":"If you're looking for fish tacos, you can't go wrong here.

The Baja fish is a personal favourite, but everything on the menu is top notch. The fresh garlic habanero salsa at the counter is amazing if you don't mind the heat.

Sure the taco's are only $5 each, but they're so good I usually can't help but wolf down 2, 3 at a time, and it ends up being a relatively pricey lunch. But you definitely get what what you pay for.

Beware, this place is pretty much always busy when it's open, and it is tiny. So don't expect to be sitting comfortably while you're stuffing your face with delicious fish tacos."}
{"text":"Better than Grand Electric, La Carnita and Playa Cabana, IMHO. Quick and friendly service, and they let you customize ingredients/toppings. $5/taco but they're filling so 2-3 per person is enough. Not a lot of seating so it gets crowded, but worth it!"}
{"text":"The taco scene in Toronto is really taking off as of late. This place sure beats growing up on Taco Bell! LOL

I would be more impressed with this place if I had not been to Grand Electric on Queen W. However, with that said this place is solid 4 stars! The Baja fish taco was fresh and tasty but I do find that the portion is a bit odd; one is never filling enough but 2 is a little overwhelming (you will be eating a lot of taco shell). The shrimp taco is OK I would say. It's also not the most comfortable place to chill or even eat (patrons just kind of stand around and eat).

Still, a solid 4 stars for serving pretty good food but I've had better."}
{"text":"On one of my adventures into Kensington market, I decided to go try out some of the new mexican restaurants that have popped up.  Seeing how this place had people almost out the door (and it was 2PM) I had to see what all the fuss was about.

The little shop is just that... little.  It seats maybe 8 people and that's about it (there's hardly any standing room).  Apparently they just opened there the day I went as they told me they had just moved from their old location.

The menu is pretty simple, you'll notice a very seafood orientated theme (although there are non-poisson options).  I personally got the Gobernador (how can you not? It's on the window!).

Holy mackerel!  or rather marlin!  The Gobernador is probably THE BEST FISH TACO I've ever had.  I wish I was eating it right now while writing this.  The Gobernador is a smoked marlin taco with shrimp inside; It's absolutely ridiculous.  Make sure you're packing some napkins because it won't be a clean fight with this taco."}
{"text":"I've been on a search for a good taco al pastor since having my first taste in Mexico in 2002. I have searched up and down the coast of California (where I am from) and all over Toronto. I can say with confidence that these are the best tacos al pastor I have had outside of Mexico. I've been back over and over again since discovering they've added these to the menu. Besides the tacos al pastor, everything else on the menu is as good or better than my favourite taco stops in Cali."}
{"text":"Two gobernadors and a mexican green apple soda hits the spot every time. Excellent food and great service. I just wish there was more seating."}
{"text":"I couldn't get enough of their tacos! So I went back to get my craving fixed. I ordered two of my favourite tacos (shrimp and octopus). Shrimp taco was delicious, messy but heavenly. 
However, the octopus taco was overly salty this time, prolly twice the amount of salt sprinkled. I ate the octopus on its own and it was okay but when i eat the taco as a whole, it was pretty salty. Not sure what went wrong but other than that, I left this place happy as ever!"}
{"text":"What happened guys? This place used to be amazing. Now you've abandoned most of your fish tacos for shitty Pollo tacos full of grizzle and switch to taco shells that are gritty and dry.  It's so sad... once the best, now behind all the rest. Good job at becoming mediocre."}
{"text":"After being informed that a long line up can form before this place opens for their business, the little budget foodie group that I often hang out with got the best spots in the line by arriving about an hour early before seemingly obscured eatery opened its doors.
I decided to take a few pictures in the area before getting my spot. This place needs to put up a really noticeable sign for their store because I walked right past it up kensignton avenue to baldwin street and when I decided to head back here I still couldn't spot it until after I looked at my map app a few times and saw one of my foodie buddies standing infront of the store. It was a Saturday and people did not start lining up until about 20 minutes before 12pm, proving the rumors about the line up. Being some of the few at the front of the line was beneficial because our orders were taken swiftly and the food was served promptly.
When I looked at a pic of their menu on Yelp, I already had my mind made up to try out the Baja Fish (Mahi Mahi) taco. The taco served in a red basket with a checkered lining was light and the fried fish was not at all greasy and the vegetable garnishes also countered the grease from the fish. However, I do wish that I could have gotten a distinct taste of the fish and the cream sauce on it. I think the real stars that day were the three different hot sauces, each heat level made with a different type of pepper. It added a bit of zing to the fish especially the medium.
I will probably go back at some point if I want to brave the line up as I'm curious to try the \"Gobernador\". And my fellow foodies also raved about the Agua Frescas.
This place seems to be the spot where if you really need to satisfy your cravings for some \"local food hub/street-food style\" type tacos that are of the comfort-food variety then go check out Seven Lives"}
{"text":"Seven Lives Tacos is a hot spot at Kensington Market!
During the time that we ate here, lines kept building up (even though we didn't come here during prime time) I really like the cat logo for this place :D

For drinks, we ordered the Mexican sodas:
* MANGO
* GUAVA
* GREEN APPLE

Best. Fruit. Sodas. EVER!
We loved it!! We ordered an extra soda afterwards because we liked it so much :)

* BAJA FISH
(Battered & Deep Fried Mahi Mahi | House Sauce)
My favourite taco out of all - the deep fried mahi mahi was so crispy.

* GOBERNADOR
(Smoked marlin taco | Shrimp and Cheese)
Shrimps were delish!

* CATCH OF THE DAY
This was just as tasty but when comparing this the catch of the day taco with the deep fried mahi mahi, the mahi mahi wins by a mile :P

Friendly tip:
Their hot sauces are ranged from mild - regular - spicy.
Spicy was EXTREMELY spicy for us (We died a little trying this sauce...). So be warned!"}
{"text":"Seven Lives is consistently a great place for lunch. Located in Kensington market, this place gives you quite possibly some of the best tacos you can have in Toronto at a great value. 

The Gobernador, a smoked tuna and shrimp taco, and the Baja fish tacos are great choices. The only taco I wouldn't recommend getting is not surprisingly, the Mushroom and Cactus taco. It ended up tasting pretty bland, and the cactus tasted like mushy green beans.  All the tacos on the menu are priced at 5$, including tax, and expect to be full after eating two tacos. Seven Lives doesn't skimp on the fillings. Each taco comes wrapped in two corn tortillas, stuffed with seafood, and dripping with sauce. You can also help yourself to mild, medium, and hot sauces as well as limes on the side.

In terms of drinks, Seven Lives also offers Mexican sodas and different types of fruit drinks every day for 2$ (also including tax). They've had everything from watermelon-mint, pineapple-coconut, and hibiscus. The drinks have always been great!

As a note, the place is small and cash-only. Expect a 20-30 minute wait during peak lunch hours. However, this place is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Ordered the mahi mahi, Gobernator  and the ceviche.  

The ceviche was the stand out of the group, absolutely fantastic. 
The mahi mahi was decent but the gobernator was dry and rather disappointing."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here before the store opened, and there was already a short line, we didn't need to wait too long as we got there early but the line became longer behind us.

I cannot comment too much about the service as there is minimal interaction, but the staff seem nice and friendly.

The size of the establishment was quite small, there is very little standing space while waiting for your food, and even less sitting space.

As for the food, I order the Baja fish, and the Marlin. Both tasted excellent, if you love fish like I do, I would highly recommend the marlin in particular.

Overall, the prices ($5/taco) were good, the food better, and I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend today, thinking that one hour before closing would allow us to avoid a crowd. But when we got there, it was full, and only continued getting busier!

The menu is very limited, but each taco has its own unique flavor. I really like the Baja fish for the sauce that they use. It is also quite big, and I think it's worth the $6 that they charge for. After two tacos, I feel satisfied but not full. 

The tacos taste great, but they are definitely quite messy. I don't recommend sharing these tacos with another person, especially considering there's no sink or anything to wash your hands (at least when I went there)."}
{"text":"These are the best tacos I have ever tasted outside of what I make at home.  I went to Grand Electric and I found those tacos to be expensive and meh.  These tacos are loaded.  Sure it's $5 and now, boo hoo...It's plus taxes!  But these are still tacos with lots of fixings.

Highly recommend the Baja fish tacos.  The carnitas as also delicious but if you go there later on in the day, don't expect to get any because they sell out on nice days.

Wish they were open every day.

Oh, on the weekends sometimes they have specials so ask about it.  It's on a small board by the cash register but who really reads those!?!  :P"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever. And great value for seafood especially. Only downside is they are a little hard to eat without a seat and there is very limited seating. So eat and run and everything is good."}
{"text":"Moved here from San Diego and have been missing fish tacos ever since, until I found this place! They are absolutely delicious and pretty close style-wise to what you'd get at a So Cal taqueria except for the choice of fish--I've never had mahi mahi at an actual taqueria before, it's usually tilapia. However, the tastiness of the tacos here make up for that. I will definitely be back many times."}
{"text":"Tacos are probably one of my favorite eats. I love the flavors & I love the messiness. I'm always in search of a good taco place and kept hearing amazing things about seven lives in Kensington Market. I had my cousins coming in from out of town and decided to check it out. This is only getting 1 star because I have to give it a star. I will never step foot in here again. I'm not sure if it was my experience or this is how they operate and people have not had good tacos. 

I walked in to a very very small shop. There was one picnic bench and some window seating. My cousins grabbed the bench and I waited in line. The line moved fairly quickly and finally it was my turn. 

I ordered Guac and Chips, and everyone got 3 types of tacos. Chicken, Beef and Pork. I've heard the fish tacos are what has made them famous but I'm allergic to fish. 

The chips are guac were good. Crispy Chips and Garlicky Guac won my heart. Moved on to the tacos. Every single taco had crazy amounts of fat. The Chicken had gummy bits, and the pork and beef all had HUGE chunks of fat in them. I couldn't eat it, and neither could my cousins. 

Also a side note; the tortilla kept falling apart with every bite, it was such a disaster. NEVER COME HERE. I would go to Playa Cabana which has amazing pulled pork tacos with ZERO FAT. 

Keep Eating, 

Angela ."}
{"text":"The most close to Mexico you will feel in Toronto! Authentic tacos for a really affordable price. They sell out really fast so if you want to have the full experience don't go there after rush hours!"}
{"text":"Gobernador and diabla are so delicious but if u want meat try the \"Carnitas\" or \"chicken\" the place is small but service go faster so don't worry u will enjoy"}
{"text":"Crazy line up! I was there around 2 pm, I was about three people behind from the door and I still waited 45 mins to get my food. I can't even imagine how long it would be for the people behind me. By the time I got my food, it was still a long line up....consistently, like it doesn't get shorter. 

With that said, would I do it again? Maybe. Depending on my mood, I guess. 

The food was amazing! The Mahi was cooked tender and we'll seasoned. The Baja, it tasted like it was in the fryer a bit too long. It was almost brown, tasted almost burnt.

I also got the hibiscus. Seems like a lot of people are getting it so I joined the bandwagon. I realize it's not for me. Though it was nice to have something to drink while waiting for forever. 

Also, their \"medium\" is a lot spicier than I anticipated. I can usually handle a medium, but this tomatillo salsa was too much for me. It's still good, but be wary lol. 

Overall, great place. If I didn't have to wait oh so long and had a good batch of fried Baja, I'd give it a 5.

Oh, I also heard the carnitas was sold out. It's interesting how it sold out early on the game. So I guess if you enjoy pork, try to get that since it's so popular.

Edit: for the past few Saturdays I've passed by here, I noticed the line is the shortest around 1pm.  Could be a coincidence, but that's what I've noticed so far."}
{"text":"Dang good tacos & deceivingly big too. Can be a long wait and there's very limited seating, but worth it. We often get them to go and eat on the curb."}
{"text":"These are the best tacos I've ever had.  Period.

At $5 a pop, they're not the cheapest tacos, but you gotta pay for what you get... and it was extremely worth it.  5 thumbs up.  If I lived here, and got to sample the menu more, I might even consider this 5 star."}
{"text":"Taco-me to paradise! (Terrible pun but that's what happened) 
A friend recommended this spot to me and yes it took insane convincing of hungover friends and a long long walk but I would redo it again for the tacos here. We ordered the pork, shrimp and chicken tacos- added dollops of their spicy sauce and enjoyed every bite. This spot is tiny and we were lucky to get the seat outside on a warm day in spring- it was one of those perfect moments. Yummy food, warm sun, and a belly full of mojitos from the previous night. 

The restaurant was my highlight of Kensington market- I highly recommend this to everyone and I'm not even the biggest fan of Mexican. One thing for sure, this place has converted me and I can't wait for my next trip there. 

They only accept cash so bear that in mind, it's more of a fast food and my only interaction with the staff was pointing ebulliently at the menu. However she didn't flinch while we finished their sauce inventory of the month so I'm sure they are friendly and accommodating. 

Love this place and will definitely be going their too often."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in the city! No place to sit inside so if it's busy you'll likely end up eating outside standing. Most of the different meats taste really good, but definitely have one of the baja fish tacos while you're there."}
{"text":"This is the best fish taco you'll ever have. I'd be here all the time if it wasn't for the crazy line ups."}
{"text":"Super authentic. Love how they double up on the fresh corn tortilla. Fresh ingredients. Best taco ever."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had anywhere and I'm not even a huge fan of seafood. Take caution when using the hot sauce - it's actually quite hot relative to what most restaurants in Toronto will call hot."}
{"text":"Best chicken taco of my life and I don't even eat tacos. I've been trying to find a replacement in the states but there's no comparison. Worth the wait and money."}
{"text":"Baja Fish and Carnitas are really good. At lunch the lineups get pretty ridiculous but thats expected. Tacos are a bit expensive ($6.00/Taco) and I only gave 4 stars because they don't mention on the site or facebook page it is Cash Only. Would have been nice to know before hand."}
{"text":"The Baja Fish taco is as good as it gets, but the Gobernador is even better. Smokey, greasy (but in the best way) and generously portioned, the flavour stays with you for a good while. Friends tried the carnitas and the spicy shrimp and enjoyed those a lot as well.

The tacos are on the more expensive side, being $6 per taco but they are larger than most tacos you can get in the city. The tortillas come stacked with ingredients that will inevitable drip and drop, which you can then eat with the forks they provide. 

They have 3 salsas available at three different levels of heat: mild, medium and spicy. All have unique flavours and appearances and are great on whatever taco you choose. Being a huge fan of spicy foods, and therefore, good at tolerating heat, the spicy salsa was very spicy while still packing a lot of flavour. However, I'd have to say the medium salsa, the green tomatillo-based one, is my friends' and I's personal favourite.

This place is a must-try whether you're a local or a tourist."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredibly tacos. I wish they had half stars, because this place is a 4.5, only losing the half star because they don't have any sides.

I enjoyed a carnitas taco and a baja fish taco. The man working there was kind enough to advise me to only order two. Three would have definitely been too much for me. The carnitas taco was perfect. The pork was superb and not fatty at all, as carnitas often can be. The baja fish taco was also great; I loved the tangy sauce they put on it. After a few bites I added some of their homemade salsas, which were fantastic. The habanero garlic  was awesome, but definitely has a pretty serious kick to it. If you can handle the heat then you have to give it a try. 

Excellent experience overall. I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"I will never understand the hype this place receives.  I'm not even sure it's the best taco place in Kensington.  The tacos are definitely hip and interesting, but in terms of actual taste they're nothing too special.  If I'm craving tacos in Kensington, I'd rather head up the street to Tacos El Pastor for more traditional goodness, or heading up on College a bit further to La Carnita.  If I'm hunting down the best tacos in the city, I'm taking the trip to Grand Electric instead,"}
{"text":"We are from the \"deep south\" so we have high standards when it comes to (tex)mex.  This is not as good as they do it in the South but it's probably one of the better taco places. The fish taco was quite good.  I think they use a different cheese than they do in the South and the shells were not as fresh as what I'm used to. Otherwise it's quite delicious."}
{"text":"To keep it short and sweet, it don't get better than this!

Baja fish and gobernador are regular highlights, and the octopus one is surprisingly excellent too! And don't underestimate the diminutive size of these tacos - they're surprisingly compact and heavy, and two will be more than enough to fill you up. Unless you're a beast. Then you can order as many as you want."}
{"text":"Yeah you can't get better fish tacos than this in Toronto. The Baja fish is just phenomenal, with just the right amount of fish and salsa, with a perfect, light fried fish. The octopus is fantastic - rich, chewy, and 8 kinds of awesome! The spicy shrimp? Scrumptious!

I'll have to try the ceviche next time.

Get there right at 12 when it opens to avoid the lines and get a seat! (there's like 6 seats and a few standing seats. It's a small place that packs real quick!"}
{"text":"I never leave kensington without having a taco here. In the several times I've been here, have always received extremely fresh and flavourful tacos!"}
{"text":"A very small place with just one table and some standing bar area. 

Tacos $5 a pop, tax included 

My fav was the spicy octopus. Love the tiny octopus pieces, soft and cooked perfectly. 

Baja fish was a good fried fish as well. 

Blackened mahi mahi was a bit dry for my taste."}
{"text":"Baja fish taco is the bomb! It's the best taco I've had in my life. 

Expect you won't be able to get a seat at this place, usually super packed and there's only 6 chairs-ish. 

Be careful with the habenero sauce, I scooped some and it's spicy as hell.."}
{"text":"Finally crossed this off my \"to-eat\" list. I would by lying if I said this was not one of the main reasons I ventured out into Kensington market. My only regret is having a 3-course meal hours before coming here because I would have happily devoured 3 more tacos had that not been the case. 

I went for the Blackened Mahi Mahi taco and it was excellent. However one thing to keep in mind is that there is limited seating available given how busy this place gets and more of a grab-n-go kind of place."}
{"text":"Believe the hype! This is thee best taco I have ever had in my life! I feel like I have been deprived of actual real tacos this entire time. Long lines and a bit costy for one taco but worth it! Mexican style and freshly made, no complaints! Best taco I have ever had!"}
{"text":"I was REALLY disappointed with the Baja fish tacos I received. Really disappointed. 

Maybe it was an off batch but there was no fish in my tacos. It was actually just a hollow log of fried batter in both of them!!! Why oh whyyyyyy would you serve that to someone?  I got them to-go and would surely have sent them back had I dined-in.

The carnitas taco and homemade salsas were very delicious but I spent over $20 for three tacos and was so not satisfied afterwards. Boooooooooo. Two hungry thumbs way down. :(

My Dad (who lives out of town) and I were really looking forward to trying this place after reading all the great reviews. We even got there 20 minutes early and waited out in the freezing cold (with my impatient 2 year old) just to try their food. Unfortunately after this bad experience I don't think we'll be back......."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch and ordered the following:

- Baja Fish tacos
- Gobernador
- Jarritos Fruit Punch

the one star was for the Jarritos fruit punch!!!

the tacos - WAAAAAAYYYYY TOOO SALTY!
service - could be better 

PRO TIP: cash only and don't plan on eating there as they only have 1 table

WILL NOT BE BACK!!!!"}
{"text":"I would probably say around 3.5-4.  I am not a taco expert by any means but I will give this review my best shot :P

I got the spicy shrimp taco and the spicy octopus taco.  I like spicy, and these were not spicy enough for me, even though I added their medium heat salsa verde.  I should have gone with the spiciest but it said habaneros and garlic, I guess the word \"habanero\" scared me a little.

I don't have anything bad to say though about the shrimp taco.  It was flavourful and I got a lot of servings of shrimp that were medium sized (at least more than 5 pieces).  There wasn't anything that really stood out to me though.  It was a well-rounded taco.  The octopus taco was interesting, I think there was a slice of cactus in it? But if I was blindfolded, I wouldn't have known that there was cactus there. I should mention that it was a huge serving of a lot of stuff, a lot of it was falling out as I was biting into it.  The octopus was pretty tender, but probably because it was sliced into very small pieces (which obviously helps).  

My only complaint about the food is that my octopus taco seemed very oily.. I don't think it was sauce. I wasn't a fan of that. The waitress could have been a little more friendly as I asked her opinion on what I should order but it didn't bother me too much.

I would come again to try out their fish tacos."}
{"text":"I can't say I loved the grilled octopus tacos. I will probably return to try fish or beef tacos and give this place a chance"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite taco place! 
I love the location and the tacos are amazing! Flavours are really good and the hot sauces that they offer are are actually really spicy! 

I would highly recommend this place. The only thing is that the location is quite small and there's limited seating but other than that is was really good!"}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying the baja fish taco here and WOW.  Amazing.

My friend and I came here just after 12pm on a Saturday.  Mind you, they open at 12 and there was already a line.  The place gets pretty crowded but the line goes by quick.  There's only one table but the walls are lined so you can stand and eat.

I've tried fish tacos from all the chain restaurants and the Mexican hot spots (La Carnita, El Catrin, Grand Electric etc.) but NOTHING beats the fish taco here.  I'm so glad I finally got to cross this off my bucket list.  It really does not disappoint.  The tortilla, the fish, and omg the house sauce.  I really think the house sauce is what makes the taco so good.  These tacos are pretty big too.  I was well satisfied with the one taco (but would've been totally full with a second).

Seriously, GO and try it."}
{"text":"We had to order and receive our food outside for some reason, but regardless, eating the food was quite the experience! We ordered a brisket meat taco and a baja fish taco (for $5 each) and waited about 10 minutes to get them. The brisket was delicious and melted in your mouth as you ate it, but it did have a lot of fat content for those looking to eat healthier. The fish taco was a perfect blend of fish and coleslaw and tomatoes. Although one of my favorite taco places will always be Antique Taco (shoutout to Chicago), this place definitely has great food quality and taste."}
{"text":"The best tacos I have ever had in my life! I love their fish tacos. Such rich flavours. One of my favourite food places to walk in and just get 3 tacos."}
{"text":"We've gone maybe half a dozen times in the past couple months. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Took a friend who loves Mexican to Kensington Market so I of course had to stop here.  As so many others have said these guys know what they are doing with a taco.  There is always a line but it moves at a reasonable rate.  Not a lot of space to sit/ stand to eat so you need to rely on others to eat & go because these tacos are seriously messy (NOT first date food!!  lol) but go, just GO you need to eat here."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best tacos I've had in my life. I could eat here every day. The line was pretty long and the inside of the small restaurant was very crowded but the tacos are well worth the wait. I loved the beef cheek tacos the most. The Gobernador taco was incredible with shrimp, marlin, and cheese. The Baja fish taco was also great with perfectly fried haddock. The carnitas taco had flavorful pork. The sauces were also all on point. Pro tip: this restaurants only accepts cash and will only exchange USD to Canadian dollars at a 1:1 ratio so you will end up overpaying if you only have USD in hand like I did."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by Yelp for the first time! Not the best tacos I've had, especially for the price of nearly $6 for just one. Small menu but small place so it makes sense. Got the Carnitas which flavour wise, the meat was perfect and juicy, but everything else was literally nothing to write home about (I'm on vacation!)."}
{"text":"My favourites are the baja fish and the spicy shrimp. (The gobenator is not that great in my opinion but to each their own I guess.) The many people I've gone with gave this restaurant a mediocre rating but personally I give it a 4/5. I certainly thought it would taste much more marvellous because of the yelp reviews. (It may have been the the medium salsa that somewhat dampened my numerous taco experiences here.) Regardless I will be coming back to give other tacos a try :)"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos, highly recommended, Try gobernador, or anything with shrimp or fish in it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fish tacos!! The tortilla and the sauces oh my goodness heaven.... so fresh and so amazing!!! My sister introduced me to this place and we get ultimate cravings for their tacos! Great portion size and all in all a good experience!"}
{"text":"Definitely the top 3 taco places in town. They do not skimp out on the meats for these tacos and are absolutely freaking delicious!!! Beef cheek and head meat taco was amazing. So crispy yet tender and it came out piping hot! Baja fish taco was also to die for. Only have good things to say about this place. Will most certainly be back! 

One minor thing I will mention, which isn't a deal breaker but is a bit strange is that when you order guac it doesn't actually come with chips. All places I've been to come with chips so it was a little odd when we only realized the chips were sold separately when they passed us our order."}
{"text":"Seven Lives is a great place for seafood tacos. Everything here is shrimp, mahi mahi, octopus, tuna or similar. Some choices are more flavourful. Everything runs the risk of becoming soggy fairly quickly.

A few other points


* the line gets long and moves slowly. Show up just before noon (closed M and T) for the best chance of getting a seat at the one table or not waiting too long

* Cash only

* they do fresh fruit juices. You will see the jugs on the counter. Be sure to ask because it may not be what it looks like. They are generally very good and quite original.

* tacos are 5$ each. Most people probably order 2."}
{"text":"This place is dope. If you haven't been here yet drop everything you're doing and get over here. Now. Hurry! That is all."}
{"text":"Came here with the wife on a weekend - was extremely busy. Waited in line for a good 15-20 minutes. One table, nowhere to sit or even stand and eat. All the food I saw come past me looked good - pretty typical taco fare. 
I got the Gobernador, the octopus, and the Carnitas. Wife got the mushrooms & cactus. 

Gobernador - ok, nothing to write home about. Mostly tasted of smoke (think heaps of chipotle chili powder) and canned tuna. 

Octopus - the girl at the counter really sold me on this - however it was not good. I had two bites and chucked the rest in the garbage. I'm big on seafood but this just tasted like something fished out of a stagnant puddle.

Carnitas - wish i had eaten this one last instead of first. was tasty, pretty decent for carnitas although i've had better lots of other places.

Wife's cactus & mushroom also saw the garbage can after two bites. Very unfortunate waste of $25. No idea what all the hype is about - I am sure one of the several other taco vendors in the area are just as good if not better. With no line, and places to sit."}
{"text":"Theres a reason why this place is shown as one of the top rated seafood places in Toronto and its for a good reason. The seafood is the star. Got the diablo shrimp taco and octopus taco. Both were amazing. The heat in the diablo shrimp and salsa (believe habanero salsa) were on point. I am from Northern California and felt this was better than some food I have gotten here."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening after eating around some other places in Kensington. The shop is small and has some standing room to eat at. Unfortunately I guess I came close to closing time, as they were out of the carnitas and poke. Ordered the Gobernador and Blackened Mahi Mahi.

The tacos came out packed. Hard to even pick up and eat! So it's a good thing they have some forks handy. The Gobernador which was a smoked fish and shrimp taco, was saucy and a little spicy. I thought it was quite interesting and tasty, but a bit too spicy for my girlfriend. The Blackened Mahi Mahi taco came with a nice big solid piece of fish which was also quite good. Topped well with lots of ingredients, tacos are ~$5 each."}
{"text":"The tacos are, hands down, the best tacos I've ever had.  100 stars on a 5 star rating system.

The restaurant gets very busy with long line ups and the ordering and dining experiences leave something to be desired.  Get a second location of good size with some seating and it'll be perfect."}
{"text":"I was worried, mainly because I was totally in love with Agave y Aguacate, and I didn't know if this place could compare to the deliciousness that was once there.

I came here with fellow Yelper, Jason C., for our... mid-day snack. We both ordered the fish taco (I can't recall what it was .. I think it was baja), and it was SO DAMN GOOD. What else is awesome is that they have Mexican Coca-Cola, and that there's an actual area for you to sit down and devour the taco.

I'm actually glad that I got to hit up this place before I left San Francisco. I will definitely have to come back for more tacos."}
{"text":"Had heard great things about this place so I decided to check it out with a friend.

Not many places to sit inside but there are plenty of interesting places to take a seat and people watch outside on a nice day.

I was a little disappointed at first as I wanted to order the Carnitas but they were sold out. Instead, I got the spicy shrimp taco and the baha fish taco what was deep fried mahi mahi.

Both tacos were excellent but my favourite was the spicy shrimp. I will definitely be taking a trip back there for that one.

Only thing I would like is if there were more tables to eat at in the restaurant, but it is a little bit tight in there. My friend said it was unusually busy the day that we were there so maybe I'll have better luck next time. Still, this was not enough to deter me from coming back."}
{"text":"Probably the best fish tacos I've ever had. Get the Gobernator and whatever else the employees recommend. They're all amazing. The only complaint is that the space is small, and it's typically pretty packed, so I had to squeeze into a corner to eat my tacos while standing with a friend, but I expected as much so I'm not docking any points for that."}
{"text":"Indeed a flavour mixture of 7 different culture in perfectly balanced combination from taco to taco. caribean, mexican, korean, japanese, chinese, italian, and greek. At least, from my palate, these are the flavours i tasted when I ordered the shrimp one and the beef one. 

Haven't tried the others but this place is already on my to-go store and I will definitely try every single flavour before summer ends! Too bad Yelp wouldn't allow more than one review from one person XD."}
{"text":"Keeping this brief...

Both the pulpo and carnitas tacos were excellent. I never thought I would say this in Toronto but the servings were very generous. One taco is enough for lunch, two is definitely enough for dinner. $9 total for both.

As mentioned below, service was aloof at best.

Will definitely head back at some point. More of a 3.5 stars than 3."}
{"text":"best taco place in the city hands down.
Once you eat here you won't ever want or need to get tacos anywhere else.

you won't be getting a tromba maguerita while you're here but you'll be eating the best taco for price and quantity/quality of anywhere in the  city"}
{"text":"Been in this place twice now and I find their food to be really tasty and good variety. My favourite is definitely Blackened Mahi Tacos. My only beef with this place is the dining place which is very limited. However, this is a common issue with restaurants in the Kensington Market."}
{"text":"We had the Poke 'N Chips,  Gobernator and Blackened Mahi Mahi.  The tacos were delicious,  but the chips with the Poke were waaaay too salty.  We could see half the chips were white with salt.   

Also,  eating while standing is fine,  but eating while over a garbage,  not so much.  And no public restroom,  after getting hands covered in sauces.... 

Would only take out from here again."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the city! I am no expert, but I always feel satisfied after eating here. I have tried the Baja Fish (Fried Haddock), Gobernador (Smoked Marlin Shrimp and cheese), Carnitas (braised pork shoulder), and Cabeza (Beef Cheek and Head Meat)...I would reorder  all of them! There is usually a line up, but totally worth the wait! I do suggest going early before items are sold out."}
{"text":"Hell. Yes. Best tacos I've ever had. Tried the Gobernator, Camarones, Carnitas, Pulpo, and Mahi Mahi. Each had its own personality so it's easy to tell that there was effort put into designing each one, and then executing them very well. If I lived in this area, my waistline would be in a lot of trouble. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Holy crap, these are the best tacos I've had aside from Mexico. I've coined them life changing tacos. I trekked here in the rain to see what all the fuss was about as I was visiting from NYC. The hype is real. Just do it. I got the octopus and.....the cabeza. I don't eat a lot of meat but the guy working there said cabeza was his favorite, I trusted him. He didn't let me down. Absolutely delicious. Seven Lives, can you come deliver to ya girl in New York City?! ;-)"}
{"text":"I mean I've only been back in the Toronto area for a few months, and I've definitely visited Kensington Market these last few months, it was one of my favourite places even before I moved to the UK. So how did totally miss seeing this place? It wasn't until a friend who recently visited Toronto from the UK, but only moved there 6 months ago, originally from Toronto, said she was definitely craving this place when she suggested a meet up. 

I love fish tacos, something about that battered fish in a tortilla... has a certain je ne sais quoi, it just makes me happy and I feel like I must get it whenever I see it as an option. With that said, I got the \"Baja Fish\" and the \"Gobernador\" tacos. The Gobernador is filled with smoke tuna and shrimp along with cheese, lettuce and tomatoes and their salsa - yummy! Taco/tostada choices are mostly on the pescetarian side, with one vegetarian option and one meat option. You can tell they use fresh ingredients and the fish was nicely fried to golden brown, shrimp was not overcooked, everything tasted as it should.

This is not a \"restaurant\", it has a nook of a table, and bar style seating, at most probably seats about 10 comfortably (6 at the table, 4 on the stools). Most of the people had them for takeaway. If you're with a small group, make sure to share the table.

I also enjoy their pricing, it's $4-7 for a taco or tostada, when I say $4-7, it means $4-7, and not $4.52-7.91, so no fuss, no muss. Nice whole dollars! 

Staff were friendly and cautious. I say cautious because my friend has an absolute dislike to avocados and had asked for no guacamole, the order taker ensured the expediter saw that the order was without guacamole, but one of the items she ordered has avocados in the salsa, so the expediter confirmed with my friend whether she was just against guacamole or avocados as a whole. I really appreciate this kind of attention to detail. 

I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Two tortillas is not enough to keep my hands clean from the stuff inside each taco..  too full of goodness. If you think five bucks is not worth for a taco, think again (I though so too, which I regret now). you get your worth."}
{"text":"After seeing how highly rated this place was, I had to give it a try! First appearance, it's a small little hole in the wall joint. Very simple and small, only one table for seating! As for the food, we ordered the carnitas and baja tacos. First impression was the portion, definitely bang for your buck and made fresh to order. The flavours were amazing, ingredients were obviously fresh. Only downside, both tacos fell apart. The carnitas were so juicy, it made the soft tacos mushy at the bottom which made it rip. Had to use a fork to eat (Can't decided if that's a good or bad thing!). Overall, this is a great spot for an on-the-go snack or quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos for a marvellous price, 
I've honestly tried tacos all over the GTA but this one takes the cake. 

Their Black Mahi Mahi tacos are a must if you ever come here, also try the cactus tacos those were pretty bomb as well. 

Highly recommended if you're ever in the area, very reasonable prices and be sure to try their different kinds of chilli salsa. Just one warning for the garlic habanero chilli sauce, it is a massive build up of spiciness so go easy on how many scoops you put on your taco! 

This place can be absolutely packed at times also so try going before prime time dinner or lunch times."}
{"text":"Wow, how this place has grown. First it was at TUM, then a  stall at Kensington, to the stand alone store. I no longer live in this city. I've came back for a taco in March when I was last in town and the octopus was good. Today I came back for the blackened mahi mahi and it was still yummy. The carnitas taco was unimpressive. I will no longer order that from here. I was happy for the business to see a line up out the door today. Bravo! I will be back for 2 or 3 things on the menu when i'm in the area but this is no longer my go-to place for tacos in TO."}
{"text":"These tacos are so good that I forgot to chew. The meal rendered me totally speechless - so, so, delicious and probably the best tacos I've ever, ever had (you see, it was so good that I can't even think of words to describe it).

We came here on a Saturday around 11:30 AM, and there was quite a lineup. We were hoping to beat the crowds, but unfortunately, we were told that lineups are common at this particular corner of Kensington Market's world. We stood in line for about 20 minutes before we got to the front and ordered. Keep in mind that space and seating are very, very limited. If you don't grab one of the small number of seats at the communal table, you'll very likely have to stand while you eat (but trust me, you won't notice you're standing after you have a bite of these tacos).

We ordered 3 tacos: the carnita, baja fish, and the blackened mahi mahi. We also ordered 2 agua frescas (delicious juices). Let me just say that these tacos will give you all the feels you can only be so lucky to find in nothing more than a stuffed tortilla (especially at this price). The meat was so tender and juicy, there were all sorts of flavours I couldn't figure out - sweetness, a tang, a spiciness - all combined to be one huge perfect party, in a taco. The baja fish taco was superb - not too fishy, but still super flavourful and powerful. The salsa has a nice smokiness to it that I've rarely encountered. Everything was so well cooked and melded perfectly together - so pleased with our meal. 

For two people, our entire order (3 tacos and 2 drinks) cost us around $21. Really decent price point - if you decide to go, please head over early to avoid the lines! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what it is but their tacos are out of this world. Everything is packed with flavour!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite taco places. Its a tad pricey but still so worth it !t Every item on their menu tastes great. Small space but lucky its in the heart of Kensington Market. If you need your taco fix, this is the place."}
{"text":"This place by far exceeded my expectations! I typically don't like tacos at all, but was convinced to try this place out based on the reviews. We ordered: the gobernador, baja fish and the spicy chicken. The baja fish was good but nothing crazy. It definitely needed the lime. I liked the coleslaw in it. The chicken was good as it had guacamole. But the star was hands down the gobernador!!! There was so much flavor in every bite. It was pretty oily but so worth it. I'd for sure go back and just get this taco. 

In general, the place is very small so more for takeout. The order took about 10 minutes. They did run out of the guac and carnita but we went pretty close to closing time."}
{"text":"I don't really understand all the five stars reviews. This place is overhyped. I too attended because of the positive reviews but in reality there is nothing really special about this place. The tacos are VERY SMALL considering the price and the overall taste is mediocre. The tacos could definitely use some more flavour. I tried three different kinds including the baja fish which was the best of the three. However this taco still lacked flavour. If you want some flavourful authentic mexican tacos i suggest you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good stuff but cash only. Blackened mahi mahi was my favourite. Carnitas was good but quite fatty. Mushroom and cactus was also surprisingly excellent. Be prepared to wait in line and then wait again for food to be prepared. It's also good to know that most options are fish or seafood. There is one meat and one veggie."}
{"text":"Mahi mahi tacos!! That's all I gotta say.. Put a little medium salsa on & grab a hibiscus drink & ur set!"}
{"text":"Went here during my first trip to Kensington, and found their tacos to be just pure deliciousness! I tried their daily special - blackened cod with mango/pineapple salsa, and for $7, it was the right proportion and flavours! The only down side is there is always a line-up and barely any space to eat indoors, so we ended up eating on the street. 

The place offers a variety of vegetarian and meat options, and has their own take on the authentic Mexican tacos. Best to park nearby and walk here as part of your Kensington market loop. Also remember to bring cash and they don't accept credit cards! 

Definitely coming back for some more another day!"}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos.

Though they are pricey, maxing out at $5 per taco depending on your choice, I haven't had anything else like it. The Gobernador is a solid choice, as was the spicy shrimp. The wait can be a bit long, and in that tiny restaurant, a bit trying.

But it's worth the wait, goddamnit. The tacos are that good."}
{"text":"It's like a taco addiction! I went yesterday and absolutely had to come again the following day.

Day One: Grilled Pulpo Mexicana Taco

Day Two: Blackened Mahi Mahi Taco

Up next: Ceviche!

The flavours that this taqueria is dishing out is dynamite! Great seafood, top grilling skills, fresh sals and homemade agua frescas!!! The tacos come loaded with all sorts of goods; crunchy cabbage, creamy guac, crema, queso or straight up grilled peppers and onions.

The counter-service atmosphere is bustling, friendly and energetic. There's not much room to eat with one table, but you can nestle in shoulder to shoulder with some fellow taco gorging pals at the little wooden bars made for standing and eating.

The hot sauce is SO good but also sneaks upon you with some major heat! The medium and mild salsa are great too, I tried all three!

This place is tops and will definitely make all of your taco dreams come true! 

You'll be back for more (just like me!)"}
{"text":"All the tacos I tried at Seven Lives had a delicious main protein. For example, the blacked mahi mahi was well cooked fresh fish and the dry rub gave it a sweet taste. The carnitas had that delicious porky flavour and were not dry (a big problem for pork). Meanwhile, not only were the shrimp delicious and had this bite to them, but there were plenty of them in the taco. 

However, in most cases the main ingredient is covered by a mountain of other stuff, such as guacamole, Pico de gallo, cream sauce and lettuce. By themselves, these additions are just ok. The lettuce is just lettuce, the guac does not hold up to ones at a great mexican restaurant, the pico de gallo is rather generic. So, they are a step below the main protein. 

Furthermore, the combination of the ingredients in the taco does not always work. I find that the stuff added to the main protein detracts from the taco by making the mahi mahi, carnitas or other fish (the delicious ingredients) harder to taste. Why make it more difficult to taste the best thing about your food? The one taco that I tried where everything seems to work together is the shrimp and cheese one. The sauce is cheesy, creamy and goes great with the shrimp. Those two ingredients are 'the stars' of the taco and are not overwhelmed by anything else added to it (only red and white onions). 

Therefore, my conclusion is rather simple. If you enjoy having your taco with a bunch of things in it then you will probably love this place, many people do. However, if you prefer more clean flavours with your taco than this place might not be for you. Either way, the overall quality of the food is good and there are interesting options. Even if you don't find the food amazing, you will still probably enjoy the experience and be glad you tried it. I give it four stars as its better than ok (three stars), but not amazing (give stars)

Tacos tried: 
Gobernador
Baja Fish
Blackened Mahi Mahi
Camarones A La Diabla (shrimp and cheese, btw its not spicy at all) 
Canitas"}
{"text":"If I have seven lives, I would love to eat at this place before I lose all my lives. This local taco place will have you wonder what you have been missing in your life - LEGENDARY tacos. 

We came here for lunch on Saturday. There was a huge line up already forming and they just opened the store!! As we slowly progress inside the restaurant, I can feel the humidity from the grills they were using. It was a little uncomfortable to be staying in the store for a long period of time. This place is meant for people to order takeout. There was a water station so go help yourself with some refreshing cold water! 

The staffs were exceptional! They gave a fun & welcoming atmosphere. You can tell they really enjoy their job ! :) 

We tried their \"Gobernator\", there were grilled shrimp, smoked marlin & cheese! I was skeptical at first because the taco was made with TWO tortillas. I thought its going to taste very doughy but I was sooooo wrong. With all the sauce & seafood which came with the taco,  the two tortilla shell was needed. We also put some mild sauce for some kick to the taco! Oh yahhhh... each bite was jammed with sooooo much flavour!! By far, this is the best taco I ever had!!

Now, I understand why this place is sooo hyped up! Their tacos are beyond delicious! I'm definitely coming back again and I'm going to try other tacos on their menu!"}
{"text":"This isn't the best tacos I've ever had but it is the best tacos I've had in Toronto. There was a small line when we got there but we ordered pretty shortly after. Then the wait for the food took a good 15-20minutes. We had originally ordered the baja fish, octopus and diablo shrimp tacos however we ended up getting two variations of shrimp tacos and the octopus taco. But because of the long wait, we didn't bother correcting them. 

I have to say the filings in the tacos were really good. The octopus was kind of dry so I wouldn't order that one again but the shrimp tacos were really delicious. I love the burst of flavours the tacos had and the small crunch that came along with it. I wasn't too big of a fan of the taco wraps they had - I thought they were a little thick and too starchy for my liking. The best tacos I've ever had was the no 1 taco shop in Chelsea market in NYC, and this definitely does not top that. But if you're looking for a good taco place in Toronto, I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"It was around 1pm and there was a lineup which took about 15 minutes before it was my turn to order. Got the Gobernator which was smoked tuna and shrimp in a taco for $5. It was good but didn't really impress me that much. I saw many people leaving with an orange coloured drink so I got one myself. Turns out its a pineapple drink and it was awesome. it wasn't sour at all and was a great refreshment on a hot summers day. There was like 2 tables for indoor seating so its more of a take-out place. Food its good, the drink was great and the wait was long."}
{"text":"Good food, good price... What more can you ask for? The tacos are loaded, and my favourite was the baja fish. I was stuffed with two tacos, so don't underestimate the size! There's no room for sitting, so take out may be a better option. Cool place."}
{"text":"a small, sweaty space
oft-busy - avoid peak hours!
also, bring some cash

i was blown away
by the cabeza taco

i've a deep longing

but six? still worth it

beware, the HOT sauce
habaneros equal death
i died trying it"}
{"text":"We went during one of the outdoor Sundays where you stood in line and paid cash for your food outdoors. I got the salmon pineapple, and my husband got the fish. The fish taco was much better tasting. It was as good as the ones we had on the beach in California. The only downside is the high price. $6 for one taco is steep."}
{"text":"Amazing, always feels like a treat to eat. If you don't like the shrimp tacos or the gobernador, you're a soulless sack of dirt.

P.S. Merry Christmas"}
{"text":"Ho mama. 

I've never had a fish taco before Seven Lives. That garbonator taco is something else; filled to the brim, layered with different flavours, and then served in semi soft (presumably pan fried) tortilla. 

Garbonator has so much in it, half of which I couldn't distinguish. Oozing cheese at the bottom. A shrimp chowder-looking filling. Fresh tomato. Man, I really want to describe this thing in detail but I think I scarfed it down too fast. 

And those fresh salsas? Damn.

You're gonna have to just go.

Edit: It's gobernador!"}
{"text":"Extremely yummy tacos. I would recommend ordering two per meal, to be greedy! They are huge portions. Friendly counter staff but the demand is off the charts on weekends. I would definitely recommend getting them to go, remember to ask for small containers for your dose of hot salsa! Would not recommend not \"homemade lemonades\" though, nothing special and are very pricey."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of incredible. The value you get for your money is really unparalleled. I can't believe the amount of fish they put on the tacos for $5. Everything on their menu is extremely good, so it's hard to choose what I want every time I go in.

Although this place is small, there isn't much seating, and there isn't really decor, these factors quickly become irrelevant when you eat any of their tacos. I've tried almost every restaurant in Kensington Market by now, and this is definitely in the top 3."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place 3 weekends ago. I thought it was great and decided to try to come back about a week later. When I got there, the shop was closed with a \"sold out\" sign at the door. I was slightly annoyed that I had walked there, hungry, and wasn't able to get anything for lunch. I didn't know they could run out of food and close early! Then I realized it was 2:30PM. Not sure why I would ever think it's a good idea to go get lunch at 2:30PM, but that's when I was there. So I was left to only be annoyed at myself for getting there too late. 

This week, I made it a goal to get to Seven Lives before 2:30PM. Heck, I would go at noon even! When I got here earlier this week for lunch, the place was packed. It made me appreciate why it's possible for them to be sold out. I placed an order for a blacked mahi-mahi taco and a fish taco. I was told that it would take about 15 minutes. So I went outside and walked a little bit to grab a can of guarana to have with my tacos. By the time I got back, it was perfect timing, as my order was ready (it was slightly sooner than 15 minutes). I added hot sauce to it, and lunch was on!

At $5 a taco, the lunch was $10. I think that's a nice price point (for tacos in Toronto).

So how was the food? The mahi-mahi was good. I'd have it again, sure. But the fish taco was amazing! The fish was battered and then fried. The batter was not soggy and not overly crispy...just right. The fish was soft and tender. Without a doubt this is my favorite place for tacos in Toronto. It's maybe even my favorite place in N. America, outside of California. People ask me if I can really say I like it better than Grand Electric. I can."}
{"text":"Unreal tacos for very reasonable prices. The spicy shrimp is out of this world. A hidden gem in Kensington.  You definitely need to check this spot out."}
{"text":"The good: the best tacos in Toronto, hands down. Every time I get a cut at crows nest, I always make sure to come by seven lives for a taco. This place is ridiculously good. Honestly, all the tacos in the menu is recommended. Perhaps...

The bad: the only bad thing is choosing which taco to eat, when they are all soooo yummy.

The ugly: not much seating. So either stand and eat or walk out and eat. 

Neutral: if you haven't been here, I suggest you make your way and try it. I am not a huge fan of tacos but this place blew my mind. Warning on the spicy sauce, as a guy who can tolerate his spice, those seven lives spicy sauce are the definition of hell on earth. It made me sweat and bring on the tears. Great for takeout, not good for dine in. Expect huge waits during lunch hours."}
{"text":"We've been here twice. The Baja was amazing both times. Food was served quickly even though place was packed. We're definitely going back - I'm getting a Baha craving just writing this. It was really good."}
{"text":"After hearing  all the rave reviews about this place, we saved it for a day when we woke up, didn't eat breakfast so we would be starving, and went immediately when they opened. there was already a line around 11:45 so we just bit the bullet and waited even though I hate waiting in line. everything we ordered was so tasty. we took it to go and ate on our hostel's roof since there was no seating by the time we ordered (which was just shortly after 12). If you get here as they open, definitely worth the trip for some pretty amazing fancy tacos. It can get a little expensive but the tacos are all really fancy so we felt we got our money's worth."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had. Everything is delicious. I drool just thinking about their tacos. At about $5/taco it usually only takes 2 to fill me cuz they really load those things up! I've tried the Gobernador, Baja fish, and once they had shark as the catch of the day. All their ingredients just work so well together and everything is always fresh. There's always a line out the door especially when the weather's nice. Not much seating room but there's lots of places around that you could just get take out and eat in a park or something. It's messy so be prepared with lots of napkins!"}
{"text":"spicy shrimp taco was amazing. I would of liked to try the pulled pork taco but it was sold out. Will definitely go back again - can't beat $5"}
{"text":"Fast stop in Toronto today and everyone told me to try the best tacos in town....they didn't disappoint.

The fish tacos - holy moly - crispy, fluffy, delicious
Basically, if it were socially acceptable, I would have eaten the entire menu. No joke.

Can't wait to come back to eat the rest of the menu. Judge me. I'll only smile because I'll be in heaven"}
{"text":"Best joint in the city for fish tacos! I've tried the gobernador, the spicy octopus and the Baja and the Baja is my favourite one. Amazing sauces - very spicy so beware how much you put on! Love the ceviche tostada as well but the Baja taco trumps everything!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered 4 items....the Gobernador, Baja Fish, Pork Carnita and the Mushroom/Cactus taco.  We both agreed the Baja was the best taco we've ever had....period.  The other tacos were stellar too but seriously folks...try the Baja.  All this for under 20 bucks - and we left stuffed. Great customer service too. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Came here after all the hype, and it did live up to it all! I came on a thursday afternoon after work, and there was only a two person line (so not even a line). Food took about 10 minutes from order to in your hands, which wasn't a bad wait at all. They had small benches outside were we were able to sit and enjoy our tacos, but they definitely aren't for long sits. I ordered two pork tacos, and the portions are generous. The ingredients are fresh, and they are paired with nice salsas/coleslaws. They are constantly making tacos, which probably helps with the freshness factor. They have different hot sauces that you can add to your taco, but beware, hot is VERY HOT! I am no stranger to spice, but I couldn't even taste my second taco after the hot sauce I poured on, so beware! 

I would definitely come back for more tacos :)"}
{"text":"Do you know how on TV shows, when a character sees the love of their life, there is a sudden glow of white light and the sound of angels making that \"ahhhhh\" noise?  That's what happened to me here.

More practical information:
- Two tacos make a decent meal.  I recommend the blackened mahi mahi, although I've still not tried one that I didn't like.
-  Roughly $5 per taco.
- For those of you who have read older reviews before this one, Seven Lives is no longer a stand inside a building with other restaurants on Augusta - it has a stand-alone location now at 69 Kensington Avenue.  Seating is very limited though."}
{"text":"This is a great taco take-out place in Kensington! The portions are huge, comes with two layers of corn tortillas.  The Baja (haddock) taco and the spicy shrimp were what we ordered.  There are salsas ranging from mild, medium to hot that you can add to your tacos. Beware, the spicy is VERY spicy--actually, I'm not so sure whether it was the salsa or the spicy shrimp anymore but my tongue was definitely on fire. They had sold out of the carnitas, so next time, I'd love to try the other tacos, including the mahi mahi, carnitas and shrimp and smoked tuna!

You can sit in and eat here as well, but there are literally no more than 6-8 seats available.  This place gets pretty crowded too, but the line goes quickly.

Overall, great stop for tacos in Kensington!"}
{"text":"i don't know toronto it's still hard to beat the taco places in nyc. if you can't close the taco and eat it I have a problem. also stuffing the cactus taco with onions is just gnarly. tried the marlin soft taco was a extremely mediocre as well in taste. Overall, overpriced, no where to sit, and surprised it doesn't have a cash only option for full hipster marks. Toronto this is so deprived. I know I stand alone here haha."}
{"text":"I love this place, great tacos for $5! I like the Baja fish and Mahi mahi tacos the most. The portions are good too! The joint is a small fast food style place with not much seating and a standing area. Located in the awesome Kensington market area, you definitely want to stop by if you're here!"}
{"text":"One of the best tacos ever and I am from California! My tacos was stuffed with savory meats and topped with creamy guac. Although this place is small as af and offers literally no sitting, I would love to come back here for more tacos. The store is CASH ONLY and gets pretty packed really easily. More than 7 people in the restaurant and you are shoulder to shoulder with someone else. Most of their taco prices range from $5-$6 Canadian dollars, which is roughly $4 US dollars. Not going to lie, this is a pricey place for tacos, but I just loved these damn tacos too much. My mouth is literally watering from the thought of these delicious bad boys. The meat was so fresh and juicy UGH I swear I died. I wish I could have ordered more, but the small eating area made it easier to just leave with an enjoyable experience than to wait in line and lose my dining seat. The store only has one small rectangular table that can seat 4 people and a bar area. I can see this place going crazy during weekdays and weekends, but luckily I came here when it was raining and frigging cold. This place also has no bathroom soooo ;(

Bottom line: pricey tacos, but well worth it! I highly advise tourists to come here if they are exploring kensington market!"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Great prices! I'm a happy customer. It's really as simple as that. Now if only I can make the crowd disappear when I visit."}
{"text":"Came here with D and his sister,  who was visiting Toronto.  Every time I pass through Kensington,  this place is always packed.  I thought the tacos here was fresh and it was good.  But I have been to another taco place that was closer to home and just as good if not better.  Prices wise I think it is en par with other taco places in the area.  I guess if I was in the mood for tacos and if I was in the area,  I would come here.  I am not a fan of the cramp space though - it was hot and stuffy and just couldn't enough my taco cause I could barely move and rushing to finish my food so that I can get out of there.  I would get take out instead of eating there."}
{"text":"So much hype around the place and while I thought the service was great (the servers were very friendly!) the tacos were okay.

Ordering two is definitely enough for one person.. well, one hungry girl :P

I thought the baja fish taco tasted pretty fresh but the pork one I had was a little bland.  I tried my friend's Carne Asada (steak) taco and it was well done with good seasoning.

The store is very small and it's probably better to get the tacos to go while wandering around Kensington market :) Worth a try for taco lovers"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Ceviche is one of the best i've had. Tried 4 of the tacos. Shrimp, Marlin, Baja fish and grilled mahi mahi. Highlights were the shrimp and baja fish. All excellent though and very flavourful!

Ceviche is a must try."}
{"text":"It was good. I wish tho i had been warned of how spicy the spicy sauce was. My first bite felt nothing but pain so I had to scoop out the rest of the spicy sauce. The taco shell was noticeably yummy."}
{"text":"I tried this place once in kensington market where i tried a bunch of other places as well. Seven lives is one of the best tacos  i ever had starting with the blacken mahi mahi which is a sweet succulent taste with a bit of acidity and also i had the octopus taco. I can eat these all day for 5 bucks a taco really good deal and you can tell it is fresh because they are cooking it right in front of you. Im really impressed by their tacos beats taco bell any day. I still have to try La carnita but this place for sure makes a really good taco.Also i really like thier pico de gallo i know pico de gallo is really simple but they kick it right out of the park. It is so flavourful, i can eat almost 1000 tacos. I will definitely come back here"}
{"text":"Amazing Tacos! A must for any taco lover. I've only been once, but plan to make many repeat visits to Seven Lives. 

I had the Gobernador and the Baja fish - both I would highly recommend... Totally worth the line-up... :)"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos on the cheap in Kensington Market!! I like to stop here for a snack whenever I'm shopping in Kensington. Their tacos are the real deal - 2 corn tortillas, generous and piping hot filling, 3 kinds of flavourful salsas. I like the carnitas and the fish tacos (mahi mahi plus there is a 'catch of the day'). Tacos are $4-5 each mainly. They also make their own juices, though I've never tried them. The place is tiny with very little seating space, which can be tricky in the winter (last time I went, there were a bunch of us standing around trying to eat our tacos without making a mess! But they do give out handi-wipes!) so it's more of a grab'n'go kind of place. People here are always nice. Glad to see their business doing so well!"}
{"text":"Not a taco expert. But this was just delicious. I am a dan of street food and this one goes high up there my top 10 in the world and it is just a 10 min walk from my home . Can't wait to try it again"}
{"text":"7 Lives Taco
 
Small taco place in the Kensington Market area.
 
Location: This is a small hole in the wall in the Kensington market. North of St Andrews, West of Dundas. Forget on-street parking, but there is a green P parking near by. Parking after 6 is less then $10 till the next day. 5/5 stars
 
Atmosphere: It is a very small place. The kitchen and the entrance is no more then 600 sq feet. They have a small dinning table that seats about 6 comfortably. Other then the table, they have shoulder high table top without any stools to sit on. And they have 2 benches outside. This place would be packed all the time if they had seating. They always have a lineup, so beware of the wait. 3/5 stars
 
Service: You are always greeted with a smile here. Even though they are busy, and there are massive lines, they put out their foods quickly. Very helpful in the choice of tacos, if you like meat vs fish, spicy or not. And the drinks they serve. 4/5 stars
 
Food: Only one word comes to mind; AMAZING. one thing is for sure, you will not leave here unsatisfied. I have tried everything on the menu at least 3 times. The fish taco is fresh, the taste isn't overly powerful. Carnitas is delish, but easily their best seller. They are constantly sold out, so if you want to taste this dish, be there early. 5/5 stars
 
Price: When they first opened up, he prices were $5 per taco. Reasonable price for these packages of yummyness. But they have raised their prices to $6 per taco. Not sure when this too effect, but I won't be going there on a regular basis 4/5 stars
 
Overall: With the prices they charge and the minimal overhead cost, I bet this place is making some good money. I do understand it sucks to not sit and enjoy your meal. Specially when it can get messy. But you can always have it to go and enjoy it in the comforts of your home. 4/5 stars

{"text":"Overpriced or maybe our need to make a new category for fine dining tacos. But they're good, very good."}
{"text":"This place really \"wow\" me ! Everything looks attempting on the menu. I love seafood !  Most tacos are soft shell tacos . was lucky got the last ceviche - seafood of the day marinated in lemon juice ! The seafood was steel head fish , shrimp , scallop . Think of it like a seafood salad with diced of tomatoes and onions, chopped parsley served on a bed of avocado purée and two pieces of house made taco shells .

The ingredients are super fresh . If you worry about ceviche taste fishy I gonna go ahead and tell you this one is fishy at all . It's refreshing and the crispy taco is the best part , it's freshly made and has a robust sweet corn flavor that is . I can't help asking for an extra one but only told it's all gone for the day. . The avocado puree works so well with fresh diced tomatoes and the hot sauce really kick in .  The only thing is the ceviche was marinated in the lemon juice for rather long due to the volume they go through. So the seafood was almost cooked and the l3Mon ju8c3 is rather pronounced .  

Never been to Mexico myself but I'm so happy whenever there is a place like this I just feel blessed living in Toronto which embrace diversity and have good food from everywhere around the world.  Can't wait to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"I really love these delicious tacos, been coming for so long! You do get a decent amount of meat but it is getting quite expensive, around $6 per taco. Also the place is not big, so it can be a bit difficult to find a place to eat in the winter, when i don't wanna go outside. But overall still my favorite taco joint in town!"}
{"text":"Bang for buck, the portions are generous & the price is about $5/taco. I enjoyed all 3 tacos that we tried, definitely enjoyed the Mahi Mahi most but would also recommend the octopus and Marlin. They were sold out of the ceviche unfortunately so I would try the next time."}
{"text":"Even though the tacos are amazing here, that's not the only reason people come back. 

Seven Lives has a great crew that makes the small space cozy and fun. Each piece of decor carries the Mexican style with a touch of edgy. Does that style exist? Idk. If it does, they've got it. 

Bumping reggaeton with the occasional R&B notes from the cashier. I could dance. I wanted to. 

On to the tacos:
I had the Baja and Cabeza while my party had the Huitlacoche and the Octopus. 
Baja - fried haddock, milky batter with a crisp outside. Classic vegetables with the picco. Just a solid fish taco. 
Cabeza - beef head and cheek. Tender, falling apart, almost minced, deathly seasoned with probably cumin and s&p of what I can guess, but dang! So good. The cilantro added a nice contrast so that you wouldn't get overwhelmed with beef. 
Huitlacoche - corn fungus. It just shouldn't be, but it is, and it is good. Like an earthy mushroomy corn with black bean paste. Such a good bite. I wouldn't have it alone though. Not quite filling. 
Octopus - I can't remember the actual name obviously, but they charred the octopus just slightly so that it wouldn't be chewy, and you'd get the smokey flavour. 

The salsas are awesome. I used to have a high spice tolerance in high school but this far down the road, I can barely deal with some McD's spices.... still so tasty. I mixed the medium and the mild and squeezed the lime. 

Thanks for warming up a cold winter day. Worth. It. Always is. Above the other taco places in the area, as it seems, the people want their seven lives."}

One thing that's important to note when considering tacos is that there are different styles of tacos, all of which diverged in the states in which there was a large influx of Mexican immigrants. Of the American tacos, there are two major styles: Tex-Mex, and California Mexican.

Seven Lives serves up California Mexican tacos - a style of taco that emerged from the bountiful amounts of seafood surrounding the state. Remember: Mexico is not a country that is known for their seafood, and the most populous city in the country, Mexico City, is smack-dab in the middle of the country - meaning that access to good, fresh seafood is limited. 

American tacos are different from the traditional Mexican tacos, but that does not make them any better or worse. In my opinion, this fusion of styles is one of the things that make food culture so wonderful. Dissemination of ingredients and techniques native to areas new to immigrants can create fantastic new ideas, and has been directly responsible for some of the greatest food innovations in history.

To me, the most important ingredient in a taco is the salsa. My favourite thing about Mexican cuisine are the complex spices, which often complement the seemingly simple dishes. Seven Lives has quite possibly the best salsa that I have had in Toronto. Had the spiciest one, and there was certainly a kick. Tried the Adobada and Baja Fish, both of which were absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Cheap, filling and fresh tacos in a variety of flavours! I keep getting baja fish tacos $5 from here and they're so good! There are 3 different salsas that you can put on your tacos - all delicious! I keep wanting to try their other tacos but I always make it an hour before they close so they are usually out of more popular items by then. Tip: come earlier for more choices!

There are usually several people in line here since the staff make the tacos on the spot, so pack some patience with you as wait. Usually about 10 mins wait until you actually get your food, which isn't too bad! Also only a handful of seats but that's not a big deal since you could always eat it at the nearby park."}
{"text":"I've gone with my spanish and latin american friends, and they all say that it's not the authentic tacqueria, but it does the best modern tacos that you'll ever eat. The carnitas alone is enough to shoot this place to stardom, but their other tacos are all delicious as well (I like the octopus and fish tacos, personally).

Hardly any room to actually eat there, which is a shame. But I would gladly stand in the street and drip taco juice all over my hands and shoes if it meant being able to eat here."}
{"text":"Came here on the word of a few friends who said that this place had some pretty killer fish tacos. They were right.

Ordered the black-peppered marlin, mahi-mahi tuna, and octopus tacos. Initially I thought that $5 for a taco was rather expensive, but it made sense once I saw the portions of ingredients in the tacos and the size of the tacos themselves. These tacos were basically one of those where you don't really know what else they put in it while you eat it, and afterwards can only really recall having a lot of different unfamiliar flavors and textures throw at you at once. But that's ok. 

Would recommend this place if you're in the area and need some seafood to get you right, but wouldn't recommend during peak meal times when the lines here can get pretty crazy."}
{"text":"Was walking around Kensington Market and stumbled upon this place. We ordered a Gorbernador and omg amazing. My eyes widened and I was smiling the whole time. It had cheese, smoked tuna, and shrimp. By the time we left and returned an hour later for more, the store closed because they ran out of ingredients. It's always so packed and I can see how that might happen!"}
{"text":"After hearing so many pleasant reviews from my friends, particularly this one friend who vowed his life on it, my boyfriend and I decided to go by Seven Lives when we were walking through Kensington Market.

Let me say that this place holds up to all the amazing reviews! The staff were pretty nice and the little joint was cute and small.

If you're coming with a lot of people then this might be bad news because there isn't a lot of seating. There's tables you can stand by and a small sofa and table by the window. It's small but that's probably where some of this place's charm comes from.

My boyfriend had the gobernador and I had the baja fish~ the tacos were $6 for one which seemed a bit pricy but when you look at the taco you'll be surprised! They put a lot of filling and the taco is stuffed! I wondered why they offered forks on the counter and I know why now! It's to pick up the pieces that fall out of the taco!

When I bit into the taco my tastebuds were taken to some utopia. It was so fresh, flavourful, and amazing. Each bite made me want more and more and I will be coming back to try the other kinds of tacos they have!

They also have three homemade salsa (hot, medium, and mild) and I really love spicy things but I decided to mix the medium and mild together and it was amazing!

I highly recommend this place if you want fresh, flavourful tacos in every bite :)"}
{"text":"Have only been here twice but both times the food was pretty great. The tacos are very substantial compared to the typical Toronto tacos although they are also slightly more expensive to match ($5 a taco). Expect to wait in a line!"}
{"text":"Heaven really is a place on earth. 

I have been here on a few separate occasions and never has it failed to leave me with a happy stomach and hyperstimulated taste buds. The lines could be a pain to wait in because this place is tiny, but it is 200% worth it. They really don't skimp on the fillings - from the actually protein to the guac and toppings, they like to load it up! I usually get a carnita and an octopus taco (forgot the name) but you really can't go wrong with any option. I'm hungry just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Bring cash!!!

Must try: ceviche (runs out early)/ carnitas/ blackened mahi mahi/ baja. The ceviche portion is enough for two and the tacos have doubled up tortillas.

The staff here are lovely and always helpful. We've always been lucky enough to nab the window bench seats every time! Don't be discouraged if you see a line out the door, the wait is worth it.

This is my favorite taco joint in the GTA- worth going very out of the way for."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! The gobernador are beyond doubt the best tacos I've ever had. And don't be put off by the price, these babies are huge!!"}
{"text":"I came here and tried the Gobernador, Baja and blackened Mahi Mahi tacos..they were all delicious with the perfect balance of spices..priced at $5 each.

My favourite was the Baja taco, perfectly battered and fried topped with coleslaw. The tacos were slightly messy to eat as it broke apart; no problem them, plastic forks and napkins are all over the store which was appreciated.

I also tried the aguas frescas (watermelon flavoured I believe?).. it was very refreshing, light amount of sweetness and only $2 for a decent sized cup.

The storefront is quite small and there are barely any seats, two benches outside the store and a window bench/two chairs inside..some standing space along the walls. Do bring cash though, thats the only thing they accept!"}
{"text":"Damn good. As everyone says, there's extremely limited seating and it's busy, even on a cold, rainy day. Regardless, the wait was short and all the employees were sweet! The atmosphere was cheerful and alive. 

Ordered the Baja fish taco, carnitas and chicken. Didn't get a chance to take a picture bc I was so busy scarfing it down. The Baja fish was by far the best (and messiest-I ended up eating it w a fork. Help yourself to the wet naps they've set out for sure!), but they were all taaaasty. I guess $6 is a lot for one taco, but they are REALLY stuffed, which is what I was before I had even finished two. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!

Went during lunch with co-workers and was not disappointed. The tacos we got were Black Pepper Marlin, Baja Fish & the Ceviche Tostada.

The place was packed when we got there, which tells you just how tasty their tacos are!
Definitely will come back next time."}
{"text":"Woah! That's one serving of ceviche!?! And did you say that it only costs $7!?! No wonder the line up was huge!

The seafood was perfectly seasoned and the fried corn tortillas tasted so fresh. Loved the honeydew agua fresca. I think I need to take some home next time and turn them into freezies! Also tried the octopus taco (pulpo), delicious! And the chorizo and scallop taco (take a pass).

I will definitely be back...with friends...or just order for them and eat it all..."}
{"text":"Not my favourite fish taco by far. I got the Baja original fish taco and found that I was just chomping on greasy batter with very little taste of the actual fish. 
The only real flavour I got was from the toppings.
Fairly small location with no real space to sit - not a big issue as that's sort of the feel around Kensington.
The line was long but went by fairly quickly.
2 stars only for customer service, and cleanliness of the place."}
{"text":"Given the California flag on the wall and the baja fish taco on the menu I'm assuming the owners are from California. Baja fish taco was a very good version. Huge piece of fish. Liked the flavor in the spicy shrimp taco but it was wayyyy too saucy. Not sure of the reason for that. Green salsa added a ton of flavor and that orange salsa is not to be messed with.....crazy spicy. Cash only. Surprised to get a solid Mexican meal in Toronto."}
{"text":"Hole-in-the-wall. By far the best tacos I've had to date. The spicy shrimp and cheese is bomb! The chips and poke, not so much but ymmv. There's usually a line and it's a small spot with little room to dine in. The restaurant accepts cash only. My recommendation is that you arrive right when they open, do your thing and get out. This is not the place to catch up at length."}
{"text":"I decided to eat my way through Kensington Market by small items from a bunch of different restaurants this was my first stop and by far my favourite!

The place itself is super small with mostly standing room to eat but they have additional seating in a unit across the street which also serves alcohol and soups. I decided to just eat my 2 tacos standing by the window people watching and I don't regret my decision at all. Kensington Market is a great place to people watch and there's no better way to do it then enjoying some good food. I had the Baja Taco and the pulled pork taco. 

The pulled pork taco was good although it just wasn't exactly how I like my pulled pork but I find I don't like much pulled pork from restaurants as I like mine spicy and not BBQ-esque. The Baja though was amazing! If you only want to have one Taco I recommend the Baja it was cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly! I can't rave enough!!!

The tacos here are HUGGGGGEE! So 3 or 4 will fill up most people! The staff is friendly and efficient you don't have to wait too long for your food! I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place. I am so glad that I came by here for light lunch!

This place was very tiny, almost missed the sign! 

The service was warm and welcoming. A young lady took my order (one baja fish taco) and I waited for my order by the side(where there were different hot sauces on the table). 

The taco was very good! I liked the crispy and hot baja fish, freshly cut vegetables in bite-size format, and warm tortilla bread. I added very hot habanero hot sauce out of curiosity. Oh! The hot sauce was really hot! I felt like there was a fireball in my mouth!

Each taco is $5, so lunch can get expensive. However, you won't regret your order. I can't wait to go back and try other tacos!"}
{"text":"Seven deadly sins...one of them is \"envy\" or \"jealousy\".  

I'm jealous of Bill Gate's money...   

I'm jealous of Brad Pitt's forever good looks...

And after today I'm jealous that there's no Seven Lives Taco in the burbs!!

On one of our rare trips downtown we really wanted to try the tacos at Seven Lives Tacos-Y-Mariscos and so did half the city it seems as the line up was out the door.

The menu is small but simple with the focus on Baja style tacos.  Each taco is $6 plus tax which seems like a lot but these are not the run of the mill Taco Bell value menu tacos.  They are double shelled fat juicy works of art that explodes in your mouth.  Each taco we had was fantastic from the carnitas, beef cheek and head, shrimp, fish and octopus were all fantastic and extremely satisfying.   Salsa, tomatoes, coriander, etc...all combine wonderfully with each and every protein given.  I can see why many call this the best tacos in the city.

The place is really small with some seating but when its crowded you will be eating outside savouring these delicious packages of satisfaction.

We really can't wait to come back the next time we are down.  

Curse you downtown Toronto for Seven Lives Tacos and double curse you Brad Pitt for your boyish good looks!!  

Oh so sorry!  My jealously is showing it's evil head again!!"}
{"text":"Runner up for best tacos in the city.  Grand Electric still wins it for me. Very very limited seating/standing room so it's best if you just want a quick bite.  I wouldn't recommend if you don't like fish/seafood overall, but if you do, the Gobenator is a must!"}
{"text":"The best tacos and the only place I would eat tacos to be honest. Fair price and not a long wait.. This would have been a 5 stars if they have table to sit down and eat."}
{"text":"Pros:
+ Tasty food

Cons:
- Very small place
- does not accept credit cards

Ambience:
4 coworkers and I went there for lunch.  The whole place is very small, likely 5 by 5 meters and was packed.  We had to push to get to order the food.  By the time our food was ready, the place was half empty.

Service:
Does not accept credit cards, so that is half a star off automatically. 
While we were waiting for the food, they did come and clean the counter tops so they do keep the place clean.

Food:
it is $5 plus tax per taco.  I ordered two and was was satisfied by the quantity and quality.  Tacos have definitely been well designed, each one had ingredients that complimented the meat.  


I would recommend this place if you want to a quality taste food and don't care about having a place to eat it."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good.
I don't go often anymore. Maybe once a year because I don't live in the area but it seems to be getting worse each time I go back. The place used to be packed at lunch time, but I didn't even have to wait for my taco today which was kind of telling compared to how it used to be

The menu has also changed, and no longer has the blackened mahi mahi taco which was my favourite. It seems like they tried hard to keep the prices around the same, while sacrificing some things. If you want a fish taco your only option now is the Baja fish, which is actually haddock. No guac comes with that one. It also was a bit of a hot mess and lacked a lot of flavour. Thankfully I put some hot sauce on mine as most of the flavour came from that.

To be honest, I can't see myself coming back here because its a little out of my way. Its still filling and a reasonable price, but you can find better tacos in the city."}
{"text":"Just ok for me.  This place has been bookmarked forever, I finally just got to go today, and it was a bit overhyped.

Tacos were $5ea, but fair sized, no skimping on the ingredients.  I ordered 2 and it was enough for a late-lunch.

The Pulpo (octopus) was well cooked.  However, neither the batter on the Baja, nor the fish itself, was seasoned whatsoever, so it tasted bland.  Tasty toppings on both tho, so that sorta saved the Baja.

Line was not that long, but actual wait to order, then for your food to be ready, was quite long.  Maybe 20mins in total.  Barely any seating, so don't count on \"dining in\".  Doors wide open, so on a hot day, it'll be hot inside this tiny place.

I'd only go again IF 1) I was in the immediate area, 2) felt like tacos, & 3) there was no line whatsoever."}
{"text":"So good that I've been here 3 times and will surely go again. Seven Lives makes delicious fish tacos!! Especially the baja fish! Everything is freshly made and they have a good selection of different salsas ranging from mild to super spicy. I would have given them 5 stars but the down side is when its busy there isn't anywhere to sit. Luckily people are in and out so it doesn't take too long before you can get a seat."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this place, it's an excellent go to if you want to be full for around $10. I would suggest getting two tacos. 

The last time I went I had the blackened mahi mahi and the special which was a snapper taco. The blackened mahi mahi was excellent, whereas unfortunately the snapper was a little too heavily salted. I've had the gobernador, baja and carnitas, to be honest you can't really go wrong with whichever combination you choose. 

The only thing I would advise is eating the tacos as soon as you get them. I live less than a 5 minute walk away and unfortunately the tacos don't travel well, all the delicious juices tend to gather at the bottom soaking through the soft shell.

I've also had the ceviche before, it's a generous portion of fresh white fish and shrimp on a giant corn chip (perhaps tostada?). I would almost suggest halving the price and halving the amount of seafood, as after getting about half way through I had had enough - it's not that it wasn't delicious, I was just ready for another flavour. 

Finally, watch out for their hottest hot sauce - it's a spicy number!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!! I got the two fish one mahi mahi and the Baja taco and both were well worth the long wait and the crowded clausterphobia ;) I love this restaurant I find the staff there incredibly kind considering they are always so so busy. The tacos are well made with a lot of good ingredients, it's stocked and choc full of everything.

There really isn't a lot of space to eat your tacos and you have to be aware that the line ups can sometimes get ridiculously long. I would recommend going during a time when it's less meal time (avoid the 11:30-1:30 rush)"}
{"text":"The fish tacos are somewhere between food and a spiritual experience... Its that good! The octopus taco was a tad rubbery but flavours made up for it."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Yup.  That's it.

Octopus taco and Baja fish taco.  Double delish.  Great trio of sauces to choose from.

Two downsides and neither really matter.  1) if you manage to snag one of the few seats - you will be marinated in the smell of frying by the time you finish your taco/s.  On the flip side - everyone who sat with us was as nice as the counter folk, so not really a problem.  2)  so much fish/octopus that the corn tacos aren't really needed. Next time I'll just ask for the innards.  

Good good food."}
{"text":"delicious! loved it-- ordered baja fish and blackened mahi mahi. baja definitely better then mahi mahi.  

also thought it better then grand electric. though atmosphere is quite different. more of quick eats, vs. grand electric is sit down bar with loud music.

this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Seven Lives and I am so happy! Great experience! The food was so fresh and amazing. The portions were great. I will make this a weekly ritual now. 

See you soon,
Cheers."}
{"text":"Good quality tacos for $5 each. They are generously stuffed and flavorful. I will definitely go back here for more tacos. This would be a great place during the summer (eat your tacos outside), as there arn't many seats in this popular joint."}
{"text":"We walked 1.5 miles from our hotel to get to this place.  The neighborhood was very.... Hippy-ish.  Trash in the streets. Marijuana in the air. 

Tiny place and a tiny menu. Not necessarily a bad thing. Mostly fish tacos and seafood items.  They stay busy as well which is a good thing. We stood in and stared at the menu until our turn.  The menu didn't real appeal to us. We were just going to settle with the $5 fish tacos.  By the time we made up to the counter, debit card in hand, we were hit with the \"cash only\". 

We left. 

Maybe another time. 

Good thing the Dirty Bird Chicken and Waffles place next door was open. We swiped our debit card there."}
{"text":"These tacos are tasty, but not really authentic. I usually get the fish tacos (baja and mahi mahi). Service is friendly even if it is slow. I've been here three times and the wait has ranged from 5 minutes to over 20 minutes. It all just depends on how many other people happened to get a taco craving at the same time."}
{"text":"I can't... Actually some of the best tacos I have ever had. I had the blackened mahi mahi and the gobernador, highly recommend the gobernador"}
{"text":"Octopus taco is amazing 
Also order pork adobado which was good 
Tacos are large, 2 is probably good for most people"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Toronto for sure! Been a few times and never disappointed; plus service is good. Avoid weekends if you can as there is a line-up and if you come later in the day, they're usually out of one or two of the tacos. Portion is good and only $5/taco. Worth it! (Cash only is the only negative thing, but there is an ATM across the street)."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Toronto!! It's a must try if you're a fan of mexican food.

1 taco is ~$6 but you get a lot of meat. It's stuffed with ingredients and they dont cheap out. I loved the one with pineapples and the first one on the menu (one with cheese).

The place is tiny and there is only 1 table and 1 wall table thing. They make the tacos after you order to expect to wait around 10 minutes.

The hot sauce is actually extremely hot..."}
{"text":"BEST TACOS IN THE CITY!! 
I've been to seven lives many many times and finally got the time to write a review on them. 
A small little joint in Kensington Market that makes the best fish tacos. 
My go to is the gobernador and the mahi mahi. You can't go wrong! 
Also, the catch of the day always varies by never disappoints. Note that there is very limited seating and is more of a take out place or standing and eating kind of place. The tacos are very very filling. 2 is good to fill you up. If you're starving, get 3 and it will be plenty. 
Also, the salmon poke nachos is so good!!! So fresh! It's definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best tacos I ever had. I had the gabornador and spicy shrimp and both were incredible. Spicy shrimp was def my favorite. Tons of flavor and well priced"}
{"text":"Mmmmm this place and the other one across the street are so good. The octopus taco is what I recommend. The meat is sooo tender and the sauce is so flavourful. I suggest getting two. Great for grabbing and sitting in the park with (if you bring napkins). There's really only one or two tables inside so it's rare to get a spot."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a small meal after going to Rasta Pasta. This place was packed! There's no AC in the shop either, so it gets pretty hot with all the people packed in. Only one 6-person table, the rest is a counter for standing.

++ Gobernador ($5)- smoked marlin, shrimp, and cheese taco. Large taco, smoked marlin was a little drying, but the salsa helps. Really flavorful though.
+ Poke and chips ($10)- salmon poke, chips, and guac. Poke was good, but the chips were sprinkled with sugar. Not really a fan of that.
++ Aqua fresca ($2)- flavor of the day was watermelon mint. Super refreshing in the heat!

Only cash and debit accepted."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and worth the line up! It's best to eat it fresh but to-go allows you to savour it as messily as possible in private :)

Must try: Gobernader, baja fish, and the camarones a la diabla (spicy shrimp)"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has been so consistently been recommended. Tacos are $6 each - cash only. I tried the baja fish taco and the cabeza. The meat in the cabeza was nicely cooked and seasoned and there is a lot of it in the taco. The fish taco is fried, but was very overcooked and not fluffy enough. The toppings on both tacos were great and went well, but the tortilla ruined it for me. 
I have definitely had better tacos elsewhere for this price point.
Also, we went around 4pm on a saturday and the ones we wanted to try (chicken and beef) were already sold out. There was a line out the door and you'll have to stand to eat."}
{"text":"Shrimp with cheese is my favourite. There's nowhere to sit, but it also doesnt really matter because there's enough space for people to stand. The only problem is its CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"so what concerned me with this place, I've been here once. The whole time i was waiting for my order I was watching the chefs cook. I noticed that the little fridge they have the fish in was open the whole time... as someone with a food handler certificate i know how dangerous this is. Fish is a very tricky food item and has to be kept at the right temperature. 

Th blackened mahi, mahi was good but the ceviche i had (which is raw fish) was very very fishy (you know when you eat fish and it has that very fishy taste?). I knew it's because it has been in the wrong temperature. I didn't finish it after taking one bite i actually spit it out. 

I can see myself going back for another chance maybe... but i think they should definitely keep an eye out about keeping that fridge closed when it's super busy!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Try the cactus taco.  And afterwards, get a mango and tajin Popsicle across the street at the Paleteria."}
{"text":"ed the first one on the menu. The Gobenador. The service was fast even though there was a line up. he tacos that I've tried are amazing ! I really like the fish tacos here."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever haddd :'D

Although they have limited seating, the location is amazing so you can eat while wandering around Kensington Market.

..the wait was approx. 5 mins for us. It can get quite busy, so I recommend going a lil' early so you don't have to wait as long. We ordered the Carnitas Tacos and Camarones al Diablo ($5 each).

I'm a hot sauce lover and I can def say that their hot sauces... are quite hot. lol, so go a lil' easy before trying the hottest sauce they have. Otherwise, you won't be able to taste your tacos :P

Highly recommend this place if you're looking for delicious, flavourful tacos!"}
{"text":"Wow what a crowded place and the lines were so long...seems a little  unclean too. However, I liked their open concept of making delicious food informant of the customer. 

Their hibiscus infused drink was quite thirst quenching in the heat of a Friday afternoon. The mahi fish taco was quite fresh and worth the weight...succulent fish nicely breaded."}
{"text":"Tha bomb!

The gobernator is the show stealer. The Baja taco is nice too. Not much seating so just stand on the side counters and enjoy. Rustic and crowded. The best tacos in town. Period."}
{"text":"Amazing (non-Mexican) tacos. Lovely people and amazing atmosphere. A bit overpriced but I'm not surprised with the new taco trend that has taken over Toronto in the last two years or so. The pulled pork is delicious."}
{"text":"This place has been suggested in Toronto for awhile. Always passed by it, always a line-up. Today I finally got the opportunity to have it for lunch. I wasn't sure what to expect; I was looking forward to all the hype. 

I ordered the Pulpo (octopus) and my friend got the Baha Fish.  Be advised they only take cash. 

My taco looked delicious upon receiving it. However it was not edible. The octopus was overlooked and tasted like rubber, there was so much filling for such a small soft taco, everything was falling apart. If I wanted a fork and knife meal I would've gone for it. 

I am appreciative that it is fresh to order, but there is hot, and then there is scorching out. I couldn't hold my taco nor get a grip on it; when I tried the filling would come out and i couldn't hold it without using a napkin because it was that hot to hold. 

I've dined at all sorts of taco places, and never had such a struggle and disappointment. I tried my friends Baha fish; the flavours weren't for me.

Thankfully Seven Lives has a paletta/ice cream place where I was able to refresh my palette."}
{"text":"My first time and I'm in love!

There was a bit of a line-up at 2pm on Sun, but the line moved fairly quickly. Most people took their order to go so I had my choice of sitting outside or inside.

I ordered Spicy Shrimp and Baja Fish Taco and both were equally delicious! Very fresh and authentic Mexican flavours!

At $5 per Taco? Can't beat that!

A must visit!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best (Fish) Tacos you can ever have anywhere in the world ! I don't say that lightly, and it took me a while to wrap my head around the concept of fish tacos but once you try there Diabla and Gobenador, life will never be the same. 

Please @7lives open more branches, one on queen west preferably so I can have these everyday ! Keep up the great work guys"}
{"text":"I work near this place and everyday I'm tempted to not pack a lunch! I've tried lots of taco places and this place is certainly #1. I highly recommend: gobernador and blackened mahi mahi! Those are my favourites :)
They also have baha (good classic), octopus (for the adventurous! It's good!), marlin (for those who like a dense fish!), carnitas (another classic) and the catch of the day (which is always an interesting surprise) 
If you're going for lunch, be sure to get there early! The line gets long!"}
{"text":"I've been to several other popular taco places in town (Grand Electric, La Carnita, etc.), but these are the best I've had in Toronto.  The only downside is that unlike the other restaurants, where there is room to sit and have a drink, this place has no booze and only a few tables.  The tacos are so worth it though.  And you can always drink beer with them in the nearby park."}
{"text":"Lots of hype around this place. Went when it was absolutely pack.  I hate lines but I am willing to wait for a good taco.

Pros:
Good Food
Decent size taco

Cons:
A little expensive ($5 no tax from what I remember)
SLOW at providing food.  Cash is quick for some reason but it gets so crammed inside. Had taco sauce spilled on me from another patron."}
{"text":"Very nice Tacos. Once you try it, you gonna be addicted. Staff are friendly and good vibes. Spicy shrimp is my favorite!! Price is reasonable but they only accept cash. You gonna prepare for it. And also since they are always packed, seats are always taken. I'll recommend you'd better take it to go."}
{"text":"Probably the best tacos I've ever had. Very big portions but you would expect that for seven dollars a taco. Every taco I had was great. The gobernador was amazing! The one complaint I have is they love to charge you the tax but good luck ever getting a receipt. I would expect that from a convenience store ,not from this place. You're already charging a premium for tacos no need to keep the taxes everyone is paying."}
{"text":"My sister and I dropped by in a craving for fish tacos. 

Came face first with a little shack that can hold no more than 10 people at a time and a HUGE lineup. Whatever, we wanted fish tacos. 
Affordable as all hell and crazy yummy. Most def worth the 25 minute wait time."}
{"text":"This place is constantly a zoo and I'm not entirely sure why. For a takeout joint they sure aren't in a rush to serve customers. I've gone on multiple occasions trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. The tacos are unwieldy and inconsistent in preparation (I've gotten very overcooked fish tacos). All in all I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there but if you are craving a cheap meal grab yourself a taco or two. There are definitely better cheap food options in the general area but sometimes you're only in the mood for a taco...

They are cash only which is hella annoying so just a heads up about that."}
{"text":"Seven Lives is a must stop when browsing Kensington Market. Note, this is a cash only business. Also, come early because the line goes out the door and into the street during peak hours.

We tried the smoked tuna, Baja fish, Mahi Mahi, and grilled octopus tacos. Across the board, the tacos were refreshing with so much flavor. Normally, I'm not a fan of corn tortillas yet these were perfect!

They also have three hot sauces: a mild, a medium Serrano, and a hot. Be careful with the hot; it is very spicy but has lots of flavor.

These tacos are neck and neck with Los Tacos No. 1 in NYC's Chelsea market."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for a very long time and was glad to see some space for our small group of 3 people. The place is small with half of its space taken up by the kitchen and prep areas, aside from one medium table and standing bar seating for another 8 people there isn't much room to move around.

The food is where this place really kicks off fantastically fresh amazing dishes that are ready quickly. Considering that this is a place that has 15-20 people in line at any given point that's an exceptional feat. Had the marlin and  beef both were seasoned perfectly and we're  great. Couldn't be happier,  but some extra seating would be nice."}
{"text":"Ridiculously amazing tacos! Everything on the menu is fantastic.. Spicy Shrimp my fav.."}
{"text":"After 3 years of finding this spot on yelp I been there many many times their taco are always delicious and reasonably priced, it lost 1 Star is because it's always so crowded and no where to sit and eat or stand and eat."}
{"text":"I think we found the best tacos in Toronto. Great tasting big tacos for a reasonable price. Faves were the mahi mahi and baja fish. Gobernador was a bit too salty for me. Cool drinks available too to wash down the tacos. Only open for lunch or early dinner, but awesome place."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to visit this place on a Saturday. The line surprisingly moved fairly quickly. The cashier was very friendly and cheerful. 

Ordered the baja, gobernador and mahi tacos. The fish in the baja taco was so tender and juicy with the batter being crispy still. Fairly large tacos for the price of $5. Be prepared to have a messy eating experience! I only wish this place was bigger and had more seatings."}
{"text":"Talk about fresh!  It's tastes delicious especially with 5 sauces you can try. I recommend the blackened Baja fish.  Tip:  cash only place."}
{"text":"I've had many a taco in my life, and I can safely say that Seven Lives has the BEST TACOS EVER. Don't be disappointed by the line going out the door. It's worth the wait! If you're visiting Toronto/Kensington Market, Seven Lives is a must. We ordered two Baja Fish tacos and thought it was pricey for $5/taco, but once we saw the fish portion, we understood why it's priced at $5. It's a whole meal in one taco! The fish was lightly battered and crispy and stayed hot the entire time.

The only downside is that there isn't much space inside to eat, so if you see an empty seat or counter space, grab it! The next time I'm in Toronto, I will definitely return here to try another taco flavor."}
{"text":"Tacos taste great; fresh, new ingredients, fast service.  But it's $5 for ONE taco; girls can get by on one taco, guys will need at least 2 my husband (big guy) had 4 and he was full.  That's $20 for a meal of tacos.

Tacos are street food for common people.  One of those street foods that are cheap and hearty. Except here....  

I'm not impressed by the cult-of-taco at this place, but I'll hand it to them, great food, good ingredients, way to attract a crowd!"}
{"text":"HAND DOWN THE BEST AFFORDABLE TACOS IN THE 6! This place looks like a hole in the wall in Kensington market but its such a good place. A must try is the fish tacos and the carnitas!!!"}
{"text":"+++
- These tacos are soooo filling, you can get by with one
- That Gubanador was the Real deal Holyfield, the fish taste is totally anonymous too
- Baja fish, does however have a fishy taste, but that doesn't take away from its goodness

+
- Shrimp taco is good, but not as good as the Gubanador and Baja Fish

-
- LOOOOOOOONG lines

TIPS:
- Don't be fooled if you come through and the line is short, there's just people lingering outside because inside is small and cramped"}
{"text":"Food was great but got really really sick after eating here. I had the fish taco and lemonade, and I don't know which was the cause. Nonetheless, the tacos has a very good size compare to grand electric and Carnitas and taste better I think. Just hope it was cleaner so I was not sick.  So I took one star away."}
{"text":"Gobornador is 4 stars. The smoked fish is surprisingly sweet, the shrimp kind of bland but with salsa and lime is pretty solid. 

Octopus and celery was 3 stars. Octopus has great non-chewy texture. But. Meh. 

Spicy shrimp is 3.5. Cheesy, spicy, and delicious. 

Ordering is efficient. Pay cash. Grab your tacos. Add your salsa, eat up."}
{"text":"Mmm now one of my favourite taco places!

I got the blackened mahi mahi taco for $5, decent price for the quantity and quality. The fish was super flavourful and fresh and combined with the toppings and sauces, and the perfectly crisp taco shell - it was delicious! 

Everytime I eat tacos, I make such a mess. But these taco shells weren't that soft that it would rip, making everything fall out.. But it wasn't that hard to make it inflexible for me to wrap all the yummy goodness to stay within the shell. Thumbs up. Also, a nice touch in providing wet wipes !

The aguas fresca was a pleasant surprise for $2. I've spent more on shitty beverages. I got the pineapple one and it had lots of pulp in it which I loved (means it's actually made with real fruit!) and it had just the right amount of sweetness. Good value for your money."}
{"text":"Found this gem walking through Kensington. I did hear that it was rated #1 in Toronto so of course had to give it a try. 

Their tacos are delicious!! Be prepared that they are not normal size. I got three and it was too much. They are doubled taco'd because they have so much flavour packed into them. 

I'd suggest either taking out if you live close or eating on the street. The first time I ate in doors and some of the customers get really cranking if you sit there even a second longer when you are done your meal. But either way the food is great! 
Go for all the toppings they have on the left hand side. Very much worth it. 

Make sure to bring cash."}
{"text":"Good tacos, 2-3 should fill u up.  Get the governor, spicy shrimps,  n fish tacos.  Missing 2 starts cause they were out of disk of the day,  ceviche, and water. ...bottle"}
{"text":"I've been here twice already, and I'm salivating to go back! I've had the Baja fish taco, spicy shrimp, Gobernator, and the blackened mahi mahi. Other than being a few bites (that's what a taco is), I can't rave about how flavourful and balanced these fish tacos taste. One bite and you get a bite of the perfectly cooked fish (or shrimp), with the toppings that perfectly balance the protein. I've also had the Melon drink, which literally tastes like pureed melon (with no added sugar). This is THE best fish taco bar none in Toronto!"}
{"text":"We drove for two hours from Buffalo to Kensington to hang out, but more specifically to get tacos from this place. Got the Gobernador, the Pollo Asado and the Pulpo. The Pulpo was by far, hands down, the unanimous favorite. It was so tender with a little toothsome resistance and was the best cooked octopus I've ever had. This place is nearly impossible to eat at though. It is so tiny and there are so many people that you end up stuffing your meal and leaving. Definitely detracts from it as I barely remember the other two tacos, though they were phenomenal. I can't subtract stars for that, though, as I'm well aware how much exorbitant rent sucks in the city. I can't overstate how damn good the Pulpo Mexicana is though. Get it."}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular. Popped in after a haircut in the market, and I couldn't have been happier. Super casual, not a lot of seating, loud and crowded. But the tacos were phenomenal. I opted to try the carnitas, baja fish and octopus. Everything was fresh and flavourful, the fish was perfectly crisp, octopus was tender and charred, and the pork was melt in your mouth. Double tortillas just because the portions are so hefty, I'm not sure I could give a stronger yes."}
{"text":"Passable but not remarkable in any way. I would say take a uber and go to taco 101."}
{"text":"Not sure why people rave on and on about this place. I've eaten here and have lined up for ages only to be disappointed with the tacos I ordered! I've had much better shrimp and Baja fish tacos elsewhere."}
{"text":"VIBE 
Now that Agave Y Aguacate is gone, it's taken on another life (hey, see what I did there?). I got the chance to stumble upon Seven Lives' first day. The staff were excited to move up from the TUM ranks and settle in the hot and hazy building where you get your churros. And yes, there is one big table at the back to scarf down. 

I ATE/DRANK
There are a few popular items and the tostada was sold out. I went on the suggestion of the marlin and shrimp taco. Everything was so fresh and it was a pretty hearty portion. I would probably get another taco and make a meal out of it. 
The cucumber lime juice was refreshing and tasted like-surprise!- cucumber. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Many more incarnations to come."}
{"text":"I've had many tacos but this place was hands down the best! Small venue but phenomenal quality!"}
{"text":"I took my date to Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos.

We had two each of Pollo Asado, Cochinita Pibil and Camarones A La Diabla tacos. They were absolutely delicious (juicy and flavourable)! One of the best tacos in the city! Also, service was great.

I made my grumpy date smile with these bad boys!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and big portion for a really decent prize. Plus if you're into hot sauces, they got a big variety."}
{"text":"The tacos are worth the hype. Very fresh and delicious. The mahi mahi is unbelievable. The toppings are great and they have a few salsas you can add as well. Fairly priced but barely and sit down room. Worth checking out for lunch or takeaway, let it be known, it is always busy."}
{"text":"Baja fish taco is one of the best in Toronto with their special hot sauce on the side. 

Looking forward to trying their Ceviche next time!"}
{"text":"The catch of the day was the grouper with apricot sauce. I think the Baja was much better. Does anybody else get a stomach ache after eating here? I've eaten here twice in afterwards had uncontrollable diarrhea."}
{"text":"When I came across this place on yelp, I was taken aback by the amount of reviews and great ones for that matter. I was really looking forward to trying it.

When we got there on a Saturday afternoon, there was obviously a really long line of people. We were trying to figure out what to order and definitely wanted the pork taco, since it was the only meat offered other than their multitude of fish tacos. Unfortunately, once we got to the cashier...we were informed that they were out of a bunch of tacos. 

We ended up getting the baja and the mahi mahi tacos. We had to wait a little while, but that was to be expected considering the huge lineup of people waiting to order and pick up as well. The atmosphere was really nice and felt authentic.

As for the tacos themselves, I don't think I can agree with the majority of the reviews here. I found them kind of bland even after putting some of their spices on top. I've been to a lot of taquerias, so maybe my expectations were a bit high. That being said, the ingredients were fresh and there were nice chunks of fish. Just a lack of flavour...

If you want to have a great Kensington market experience, then sure stop by. But I didn't find the tacos worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE the food here!!! Honestly, I don't mind the wait, the line up, everything. The food is perfect tasting and priced, and you really only need one to feel super full, at least for me. The drinks they make here are also exceptionally tasty, so I definitely recommend it! I just wish they had more/better seating, I always get a little scared when accidentally stepping backwards into that hole right by where you wait."}
{"text":"The Haddock tacos are huge! Definitely worth $6!!! Best taco I've had in Toronto so far."}
{"text":"The BAJA fish taco is really good!!!! And it's $5 no tax! I especially like that they have a choice of sauces to put on after, and that the spicy one is actually really spicy! :)

It's delicious and Id come by any time i can :)"}
{"text":"it has a great place to grab a on the go bite. The section are amazing. I really like the squid taco it was so delicious."}
{"text":"I don't normally eat Mexican food, but these tacos were simply fantastic! The blackened mahi-mahi taco was one of my favorites, featuring slight caramelization from the char. I also really enjoyed the Gobernador. Really looking forward to trying the octopus taco. Word of warning: they're not kidding with the spicy sauce, that stuff BURNS!"}
{"text":"I didn't know tacos could taste this amazing until I came to Seven Lives. Now tacos everywhere else are disappointing in comparison.

I just got two tacos: the \"Gobernador\" and the pollo asado. They were both absolutely delicious: tender chicken and fish, creamy melted cheese, tons of spices... I could rave about them for hours. Suffice to say they made my whole day.

Two unfortunate drawbacks to be aware of. Firstly, the restaurant is quite small, so it can get quite cramped while you're standing around waiting for your food. There's not a very good system in place. Secondly, the food is pretty messy, so you'll need extra napkins. But I can forgive these faults because the food was so good.

Seven Lives is a must-stop eatery in Kensington Market. Come here for a life-changing taco experience."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the city! Try the tuna one. It sounds unusual as a taco flavour but it's sooooooo good."}
{"text":"These tacos are some of the most incredibly flavored and packed tacos I have ever had! For $6 a pop, you don't get a small ass taco, you get a decently sized double layered tortilla stacked with whatever meat you choose and delicious sauces. Definitely provided generous amounts. 

I ordered three tacos; marlin, spicy shrimp and the octopus taco.

Marlin taco was grilled, topped with a sweet mango slaw.

Spicy shrimp tacos has cheese in it, but isn't cheesy, it's more of a background with the cabbage, shrimp was grilled and a good kick spice in their sauce.

The octopus was chewy but not super tough, topped with cilantro and a white sauce.

They have some salsa by the counter, but I don't think you need to add anything to these amazing creations. Place is definitely tiny, with only one table and a few spots to stand but you best check this place out if you out here in Toronto. Cash only!"}
{"text":"I  couldn't  wait to  experiment with  this  location  after  finding  it on Yelp and seeing all their  photos  on instagram.  I got The Geographer (gin,  of course ) and it was  extremely   delicious .  We then got the octopus, lamb ribs, and some duck  dish ,  together with  some rice. Every  meal  had its own  individuality  to it, whether it's the meat-veggie  combo , or the spices and flavours of the  dish . Every  very first  bite was  almost  like a surprise, and  consuming  here was  a great deal  of  enjoyable .  The wait time for each  meal  was reasonable.  Whatever  is  implied  to be shared so it  felt like  I was  continuously   consuming ! The  parts  were all on the  smaller sized  end and if you are  a big  eater,  watch out for  your wallet!!   Something  I  also  liked about the  place  was the interior  decor ."}
{"text":"The Gobernator is the best fish taco I've ever eaten. 
Don't get just one, you'll be back in line for more!"}
{"text":"All the tacos tasted the same to me, a lot of guacamole and salsa to the point I couldn't differentiate the different tacos. It still tasted fresh and if youre in the area it may be worth it."}
{"text":"Came here during the awkward between lunch and dinner lull and avoided any sort of lineup. We shared four tacos between the two of us and definitely left satisfied. The tacos are loaded and made to order. The Baja fish and octopus were particularly good. The carnitas and mahi mahi though good, were relatively less impressive."}
{"text":"People rave about these tacos, and I have given them a shot twice. I always request that onions be omitted, and they do a great job at following my request. It sounds like a simple enough request, but believe me, many food establishments struggle with the concept. Unfortunately, they seem to depend on onions to give their tacos that kick of flavor that they need, and as a result, my tacos have tasted bland. This is why I prefer the tacos at La Carnita and Grand Electric, because every time I order their fish tacos, the lack of onions does not affect the taste. But then again, at Grand Electric and at La Carnita, several of their tacos don't even come with onions. 

What I do love here is their lime juice. It is fresh and crisp; exactly what you need on a hot afternoon."}
{"text":"BEST TACOS IN TORONTO! Fully loaded, flavours on point, double CORN tortilla - perfect. Maybe not authentic, but delicious. We used to come in here all the time for the camarones a la diabla taco (spicy shrimp) but unfortunately they took it off the menu because they weren't able to keep the taco pricing consistent at $5 and keep making money off the item due to rising price of shrimp. EXTREMELY sad about that - I would have been happy to pay more for that taco. I used to make the trip all the way out to Kensington just for this taco so I hope management decides to bring it back :("}
{"text":"I agree with most of the good reviews about this place- amazing tacos. Tried the carnitas, fried fish and a mix of tuna and shrimp and they were delicious!!! I was surprised at how large they were! If you are in the area- definitely stop by and try them out!"}
{"text":"AMAZING TACOS! We are from Detroit,Michigan and we came in for Labor Day weekend and found this hidden GEM. They were about $6 Canadian for each taco and they were well worth it. Each taco was just stuffed. Small seating area and tiny spot but it was just amazing! My favorite was the Baja Fish Taco and the Beef Cheese and Meat Head taco. Great spot and it won't disappoint. Must try"}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the best tacos I've ever had. And I mean ever had. This place is absolutely a hidden gem and needs to be explored by all those who pride themselves on knowing good Mexican food. The shrimp taco was so delicious and tasty. The blend of flavors was absolutely delightful. The steak mix taco had a great kick of flavors. I appreciated the contrast between the two tacos as a pair."}
{"text":"Good place! Shrimp tacos are amazing. Prices are really low. It's definitely worth checking out while you're in Kensington market area. I don't recommend mash room and cactus tacos."}
{"text":"fish tacos are my favourite food and these are by far the best I've had in Canada. Do it. Now."}
{"text":"High quality taco! Nothing to complain about at all.

All the ingredients are fresh, stuffed to the brim. The flavours blend so well too, every bite is fun. 

The owners are also super cool. It's a cool place for sure. 

Nothing more to add, go try it!"}
{"text":"These tacos were pretty good! I ordered 2 different tacos, chicken and spicy pork. They were extreeeeemely flavorful and filling. I got 2 but didn
t realize how big the tacos were. If you're pretty hungry, 2 should be enough. They don't skimp out on the protein either. It also has two tortillas! They have many different options that all look amazing. And they have sauces on the side, I love spicy so I was very delighted that the one labeled hot was actually very hot. I would say it is definitely worth the visit!!! 

This place does have a couple drawbacks though. For one the sizing, there isn't really a place where you can sit down and enjoy, they have a bench outside and 1 table inside. It's also cash only which sucks as I'm not from Canada and didn't have Canadian dollars. They were also out of a lot by the time I got there, guac, chips, sides. (around 7 PM). 

All in all I would go back just to try more flavors. Tacos are kind of my thing so I definitely recommend. :)"}
{"text":"STOP READING AND JUST GO. (Wait, it's CASH ONLY. Also, it only has a few seats so it's not the best place if you're looking for a sit down restaurant. 

Gobernator:
- Smoked marlin, shrimp, and cheese
- The shrimp was cooked really well and not chewy nor dry

Adobada:
- Spicy pork and pineapple
- Tender pieces of pork

Strawberry Lemonade:
- Not too sweet and not too sour, overall pretty good and refreshing
- They also have other sodas at the restaurant or drop by other places nearby for a horchata or a smoothie

Over the years, I've tried many of the different tacos here (Baja fish is also delicious!) Seven Lives is the perfect place for a quick bite for lunch on the weekend or as one of the must stops if you're on a Kensington food tour. It has never let me down!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype. 

Stuffed from eating hand-pulled noodles just an hour before arriving at Seven Lives, we couldn't resist. We packed ourselves into the tiny place and gladly waited in line for what was about to be an incredible food experience.  I ordered the carnitas and my husband got the Camarones a la diabla (spicy shrimp with cheese), our orders were up in lightning speed. We grabbed them excitedly, walked across the street and stopped on the sidewalk to dig in. 

My carnitas had great flavor, was moist and dripping with juice. And there was a generous amount of meat. The seasonings on the pork had the perfect balance and amount of heat, complemented by the tomato-y salsa and delicious soft corn shell. An order comes with two tacos--I could've eaten four easily, they were that good.  

My husband loved his fish taco and said it wasn't greasy or over-fried and dressed with a nice sauce that had a kick. Unfortunately, I was unable to try it because I'm battling a shellfish intolerance right now that I hope goes away soon.   

If you on a weekend, expect to wait in line and don't expect a seat."}
{"text":"Even with living is San Diego, as I do, you'll have a hard time finding tacos this good. Great spread to choose from, nothing will disappoint. Refreshing, fresh and delicious agua fescas to compliment the food will make your day! Very nice selection of salsa. Would eat here on the regular if I were closer. Excellent!"}
{"text":"THE HYPE IS REAL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!!!

If you are ever in Toronto, you need to go to this place. The tacos are mouthwatering good at a very fair price!  

I got the Gobernador and lets just say... I have no idea what that word means but it is angelic. The moment the Gobernador entered my mouth, I was at the mercy of the flavours as the sauce trickled down my face. I was shameless and that was when I believed love at first sight. 

I am excited to return to try the other choices especially their ceviches! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Came on pedestrian Sunday so their star taco was not available. I ended up getting a grilled mahi mahi which was humongous (for a taco) and filled with flaky fish. It was a little messy to eat but delicious. Place is tiny with only one table and mostly standing bar area, so it can get crowded."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here FOREVER, as this place has great reviews.

Place appeared quite busy but the line itself wasn't that long on a beautiful Sunday afternoon, maybe 5 minutes. I had to get the Gobernador, since it was loudly advertised on the storefront glass window. 

Very impressed with the shrimp on the Gobernador, juicy and plump (and bonus - had the intestines removed!). Great ratio. Double layer of taco tortilla, which is a great choice, as the fillings don't seep through the flour. The smoked marlin didn't taste very fishy to me - if anything, it kind of looked at tasted like beef or pork. They are pretty hearty and filling, bigger - if not nearly double the size than your average Toronto taco (think Playa Cabana family, El Trompo, Grand Electric). Just one was fine for me if you're not that hungry. For a bigger person, two would be alright, three if you're hungry. A little spicy for my taste, however. 

This is definitely a takeaway place as there are people trailing out the door and I found it just too cramped to eat in or even on the benches outside. Be warned - you'll bump a shoulder or two trying to adorn your taco with some tasty condiments and lime. Can't speak too much to the \"ambiance\", so to speak. Walk two minutes and find some empty steps in the wonderful expanse that is Kensington instead!

Advertised as 6 bucks plus tax, ended up being over seven dollars each, curiously. Cash-only. Best tacos in Toronto? Debateable, but you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"If you are in the Kensington Market area, definitely stop by and grab a taco. It's more of a \"snack\" place. Very limited seating. Grab and go. Taste is not lacking."}
{"text":"If you're hanging out in Kensington Market, there's a big chance you'll walk by and see a long line snake out from inside this small taco joint. 

We walked by on a summer weekend and I was shocked when we could actually see the cash register. Needless to say, we made a quick decision to drop in and see what all the hype was about. 

Grabbed a \"catch of the day\", carnita (pork), and some ceviche. Took a little while, but it was fine since it was like 40+ degrees out and we were waiting underneath their tiny air conditioner.

Slathered on some of their homemade sauces, and asked for the \"hot\" one. I want to warn you that this stuff is potent. I mean, REALLY potent!

All of the tacos were good but we really liked the fish tacos. Lightly battered, just enough greens and pickled goodness, and of course the \"burn your face off\" sauce. Ceviche was very fresh too, with some really nice citrus elements, and hunks of seafood in the mix. Unfortunately by then I couldn't feel my face, but i would order it again. 

Quick Pro Tip #464: Grab a bunch of napkins because the stuff is messy! Also, there are very few seats inside, so you'll want to scope out a good leaning post nearby."}
{"text":"Tried the Baja fish taco! The fish was super crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Tasted very fresh and light. Portion seem small though. Next time will have to buy two or three. :)"}
{"text":"There's always a line up at this place and the hype is real. 
Best fish tacos I've had. I had the blackened fish taco, the fish was well seasoned. Double shell taco, plenty of toppings and full of fresh ingredients. The different flavours were all prominent giving it a bit of depth. 

Someone leaving the shop said \"that's the best taco I've ever had in my life.\"  I agree."}
{"text":"Very good fish tacos in Kensington Market. Get a fish tacos for 5$ each. My favourites are the  gobernador, blackened mahi mahi and Baja fish. Their freshly squeezed juices are also a delight to drink on a hot summer day. The place is not really designed for sit down eating as it is quite cramped. Also if you go around on a weekday lunch be prepared to wait in line for at least 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I've been to few of the taco joints around the city and Hands down this is my favourite one. In terms of value, this place is exceptional for the $5 price, portion size, taste and freshness! The spice bar offers Hot, Medium, Mild. Caution the HOT is spicy and if you put too much you might end up crying! Definitely don't plan on kissing anyone and wash your hands after if you don't want a surprising burn. My recommendations are order 1 for a snack, 2 for a meal. Top ones for me are in order - Baja, Carnita, blackened mahi mahi. For seafood loves opt for Octopus or shrimp tacos! Summer hours are extended to 8pm. Plenty of bike or car pArking with a public parking lot Green P around the corner or TTC street car on Spadina. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"The best seafood tacos in Toronto. period. 

It is a fast food concept tacos place, very limited seating, limited standing space, always long line up. Yet service is friendly. But I still come back for the delicious tacos!!

I also tried the ceviche and Poke 'N Chips. Poke is highly recommended if you want something other than tacos."}
{"text":"Taco-bout a tasty spot! Don't matter what you order 'sal-sa good! Something-something-something avocado. 

But yeah, this place is superb. Before eating here, I had no idea that cactus could be so damn delicious. There's also a seafood taco which will melt your taste buds with flavour. In short, these tacos are so good that you'll taste colour and hear flavour and your senses will never be the same but that's okay, because you'll always remember these tacos."}
{"text":"I always make sure to stop by Seven Lives whenever I'm in Kensington Market - hands down one of the best tacos I have ever had. Baja Fish was crispy on the outside and perfectly flaky inside. Cabeza was tender and tasty but also very messy so load up on the napkins. Tried the Cajun Catfish during my last visit since it was on special ...and still wish it was on their regular menu. 

The place is small with limited seating and can get very crowded. The lines can get overwhelming during the weekends. Make sure to bring cash as it is cash-only."}
{"text":"I tried Seven Lives a couple of years ago after someone told me \"it's the best baja fish taco they've ever had\". Wanted to test that claim. Fast-forward two years - I've tried many different taco places around the city (La Carnita, Wilbur, Tacos el Asador, etc). Seven Lives remains my favorite. I was also in San Diego recently (the home of the fish taco!) and had a chance to try a few taco places there. Seven Lives is definitely comparable.

I would stick with the classic Baja Fish taco if it's your first time, but do make sure to try the rest of the menu. Their salsa bar has only three options, but all are very tasty. Beware of the hot one - it's hotter than you think :) Prices aren't the cheapest, but worth it for what you get. 3 tacos should be filling for the biggest appetite. 2 is a good amount for a light lunch or dinner.

It's a pretty small restaurant (one table for seating). Most people stand or get take-out."}
{"text":"I'll start with the cons:

Really small and cash only. It takes a while to get food sometimes because it gets so packed. 

Now for the pros:

The food is good. It's on par with some authentic places I've been to in Los Angeles and San Diego, it wouldn't be the best out in SoCal, but this is Toronto! 

So I got the pineapple juice, a fish taco, an octopus taco, a cactus taco, and a carnitas taco. I thought the carnitas was a little dry and lacking flavor. That was my least favorite. The octopus was interesting, I didn't really like the celery aspect. The fish taco was excellent, pretty standard but very tasty. My favorite was the cactus taco. I've never had anything like it, but it had the perfect amount of spices and balance. 

I liked this place a lot, and I'll probably be back when I'm up in the area again."}
{"text":"I think there's a bit of a taco craze going on in Toronto right now, not that I mind.

Stopped into Seven Lives on a Wednesday night for dinner.  We got the Baja, Cajun and Octopus tacos (all $5 each) and was able to snag the last serving of ceviche for the day ($7).

Seating is limited so we took our order across the street to the patio at Cold Tea.

I love the Baja taco and the Octopus was delish as well but the star of the show for me was the ceviche.  It had huge chunks of lobster and shrimp - perfectly seasoned, mixed with a nice serving of guacamole.  If it wasn't the last order of the day, I would have scampered back across the street and got another order.

Definitely will be back for more of that fantastic ceviche and the tacos aren't too shabby either."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's legit SoCal style (coming from someone that's lived there and has had real Mexican tacos). 

The octopus taco really surprised me as I'm not usually a fan of the texture and tends to be very chewy when cooked elsewhere. However, they make it right here. It's very soft and blends in very well with the sauce and pumpkin seeds. A definite recommend!

I've also tried La Carnita and Grand Electric. They are awesome in their own right but if you want real authentic, down and dirty Mexican-SoCal tacos this is the place to be. 

This place is not a good dine-in. They have seats but very limited, maybe 6-7 indoor and 4 outdoor. Great take-out option.

Also making it a goal to try every item on the menu. Two tacos will fill me up good. Three would be pushing it. So far, I've tried the octopus taco and baja fish. They also have daily specials (they go real fast!)."}
{"text":"Neat little place to spend your $20 in Kensington. Get three tacos and two pops. My personal favorite is blackened mahi mahi generously lubricated with fresh lime juice and green mild sauce in combination with Mexican cola. Carnitas is second best and all others are usually out of the menu by the time I make it there. So, hurry up and trade one of your lives for a taco, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh and quite large/filling for a taco! Came here on several recommendations from local Toronto friends for a Saturday lunch and it was right before a huge line formed so I didn't have to wait too long. I had the Baja fish which people recommended and also the chicken. The fish was super crispy and fresh, and the chicken was seasoned nicely and great as well. I'll have to come back and have some more before I leave!"}
{"text":"Really cool space, but the tacos themselves weren't great. I'm not from Toronto so I can't compare to other places in the city, but overall flavours didn't quite hit it or blended oddly when put together. 

The pork was very well cooked but under seasoned.  Staff was friendly and service was prompt."}
{"text":"Visiting friends here in Toronto. They too live great food and were raving about this place 2 days prior to our arrival.
Quite simply a fantastic taco joint!! 
Very simple menu.
Friendly staff.
At 11:50am we were #6 in line. Once in the line grew fast!
Fresh and clean tasting.
Simple and tasty batter on the fish. 
Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Tldr: Solid, fresh, tasty seafood tacos, reasonable price, friendly staff, would recommend 

Oh boy this place is legit. Seven lives serves fresh, delicious tacos with unique flavors. It's not your ordinary beef, pork, or chicken taco joint. Their tacos focus on seafood like shrimp, fish, and octopus. What's neat is they have a \"catch of the day\" taco option, so that's definitely something to look forward to if you're feeling adventurous. 

I personally like to get the Gobernador (Smoked tuna, shrimp and cheese) and the Pulpo Enojado (Spicy grilled octopus). Both tacos burst with flavour when you bite into them, as the toppings dance happily together with their respective creamy and zesty sauces in your mouth. I would also suggest adding a pinch of lime if you want that extra acid.

Service is great, and the staff are super friendly. I would also suggest to keep this place as a take-out joint because there's practically no space to sit down. Prices are reasonable, would recommend to any taco lovers out there!"}
{"text":"!!~~~yum~~~!!

the baja fish is truly one of the best i've ever had! only thing that sucks is that they are so small. a proper meal would need minimum three tacos.

oh -- and be very fucking careful with the habanero hot sauce yikes it totally ruined my meal last time never encountered a hot sauce so spicy i think the employees were laughing at me when i asked for more water with tears running down my face and why don't they have horchata?!

they should get some horchata poppin -- the hibiscus tea is good tho too, very into that"}
{"text":"I come from Texas, where excellent tacos are a daily thing and the standards are high. That being said, OMG the Diablo shrimp tacos. I'm only in Toronto for three days but I'm making sure I get back to have some more. $5 a pop- not so bad either :)
Cash only!!"}
{"text":"Jam packed on a Sunday afternoon so be prepared to grab and have a place in mind to eat your tacos in peace. Tacos are made with two grilled soft tortillas so there is a nice texture to them. I had the Baja Fish and it was delicious, the batter is light and the fish isn't overpowered by the other ingredients. They have house hot sauces on the side that provides a nice level of spice to your tacos. Although delicious, two tacos comes to approximately $11 and is not at all filling."}
{"text":"After hearing the many raves for this place, I finally got the opportunity to try this place.  It's a small and mostly standing room only that specializes in Baja style seafood tacos.  Seeing how I loved the tacos when I went to San Diego, I was hoping this would bring me back to those I had by the shore from a great food truck.  I would say that Seven Lives is probably the best taco in Toronto... does it compare to San Diego or Antique Taco in Chicago?  Not quite... but Seven Lives is definitely worth the trip.

We ordered Baja Fish, Spicy Shrimp, Goobernador (which is smoked tuna, shrimp, & cheese).  For these 3, it was $20... comparing to SD and Chicago, this was really expensive.  I was able to get better tacos, more refined, and more of them.  I would pay $9 and get 2 or 3 tacos at times.  Back to Seven Lives, I love how everything is freshly made... there is a constant line up and they're deserving of it.  The spicy shrimp was probably the best as it packs a very flavourful punch without being too crazy hot.  Shrimps were just the right chew and not rubbery.  The Baja fish was nicely crisp and fresh from the fryer.  It was good .. the sauce was the only thing really flavouring the whole taco.  I think the Antique Taco was better because it has multiple components adding the flavour and textures to make it amazing.  For the Goobernador, the smoked tuna was really good... it had that true smokey flavour while still being very meaty... if you didnt tell us, we may have guessed it was pork.  

Overall, this is a solid taco and possible the best Toronto has to offer.  Just be ready for lines and walking about while eating your fresh and good tacos.  Hopefully not in the dead of winter!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I was thrown off by the hype, but it was not at all as good as I was expecting, especially with some calling these the best tacos in the city. That being said, both tacos I had were decent, with ample, filling portions, but they were simply not tasty or memorable enough to rave about. The Gobernador was easily the best of the two, with the smoked tuna seeming more like pulled pork than tuna, however the shrimp was unevenly cooked, leading to an awkward hot/cold temperature variation when biting into the little guys. Overall though, still a quite enjoyable taco. The octopus taco however was quite disappointing. The meat was over-cooked and rubbery, while absent of much addition flavour. After having a superb octopus taco from the Buster's Sea Cove food truck, I was expecting something similar, however this fell far from expectations. I immediately regretted not getting the spicy shrimp taco instead. The small space had a perpetual line-up, but it moved quickly enough to not be a major issue. The staff seemed to be on the ball, getting orders out ASAP."}
{"text":"Tasty seafood tacos in Kensington for a good price. Stopped by at 6pm on a weeknight and it was thankfully only about 10 minutes to wait, order, and get the food - though the line was already snaking out the door by the time I left. I got the Blackened Mahi Mahi Taco ($5) and it was generous enough that I had to eat some filling before I could fold it up. The fish was fresh, crisp and tender, and I liked the double layer of corn tortillas. This was more than I expected for a snack so I think two tacos would make a good meal. 

The service is fast for what it is, but there wasn't much space to wait for the food. Seating was limited to a table for 4-6 and it was pretty difficult to squeeze in. I can imagine it getting pretty stuffy and crowded during the summer, but I'd love to go back and try the other flavours."}
{"text":"Seven Lives continues to be the standard for fish tacos. No matter where I go, I always compare it back to the coveted Seven Lives taco. After having these, other places will likely disappoint, so I would not come here if you expect to have decent fish tacos elsewhere.  The Baja Fish and Gobernator are my top orders, and 2 is usually enough (so you can stuff yourself with other goodies in Kensington). The ceviche comes open-faced on a hard shell, which is difficult to eat with a plastic fork and usually a mess...so I've only attempted it a few times. The self-serve hot sauces on the side have plenty of kick (the first time I put too much and couldn't taste the fish). Still one of my favourite places in town.

Service is usually quick, even if the line goes out the door. Seating can be awkward as it's by the wall or a shared table inside. There are a few patio tables outside when it's warmer. Opening hours are sometimes erratic, but when it get it you'll love it."}
{"text":"It's a good little joint which serves nice tacos. They're not out of this world amazing tacos, but good tacos. This place is great for a quick little bite when you're wondering the streets of Kensington Market and craving Mexican food. Their tacos are not as good as Barrio Coreano, for instance, but they're cheaper. The staff is friendly and fast. I will probably be back next time I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about this place, finally got a chance to try it.

Black Pepper Marlin, Gobernador, Baja Fish ($5 per taco)
The Black Pepper Marlin is a grilled marlin with avocado sauce. The Gobernador is smoked tuna mixed with shrimp and cheese. The Baja fish is deep fried mahi mahi with cabbage and served with house sauce. The Baja taco was actually my favorite - the fish was really crispy and love the sauce. All tacos overall were really good and flavorful. The Black Pepper Marlin was my least favorite though, think I just wasn't liking the fish itself. The tacos look small but they are actually quite filling as they are stuffed with ingredients. 

Pulpo a La Mexicana ($5)
Grilled octopus tacos, this was really tasty and flavorful.

Note: Their hot sauces are quite spicy. Mild is good, medium brings out a good kick but I heard Spicy is extremely spicy. Unless you can really handle spicy I don't think you should go for it."}
{"text":"4.5*
I have been to Seven Lives more times than I can remember. The little shop is always busy no matter when you visit, but the turnaround is pretty quick and the food is often worth it. Be prepared to eat standing up or take your food to a nearby park as seating is extremely limited. 

The two items that have never disappointed through the years have been the famed Gobernador (shrimp and Tuna) and my personal favourite The Blackened MahiMahi. The latter is the best tasting MahiMahi I have had anywhere (trumping anything I tried in Hawaii).
There is often a catch of the day which has been a hit more than a miss in my experience. The trout and octopus have been particularly memorable! The marlin is the only taco I have found too salty/ seasoned and along with the cactus or carnitas is not something I would order on the regular. 

Overall, an amazing place to grab a quick lunch on a weekday. Come prepared to order, don't ask for substitutions, and indulge on some of the best fish tacos north of Cali!"}
{"text":"Had the Baja fish and Gobernador taco and both were excellent.  The Baja crunch factor made it stand out more than the popular Gobernador.  Will have to go again and try the other options on the menu.  

Crowded, standing room only.  Good option for takeout, or a quick bite - not for lingering."}
{"text":"Believe me - it's the best taco in town.
I've been really loyal to them since I started having their taco a year ago (long before they moved to 69 Kensington Ave.). Their Baja fish taco is especially amazingly done - however, you shall just try everything else in the store. The daily special is highly recommended as well since they make that with the freshest ingredients they have.
Oh, also, get the homemade special juice. You will not regret of paying that 3 dollars, believe me. (My favorite is the mint watermelon juice....damn good)

One thing tho - the tacos are not that filling to me. Seven Lives is a shop about the flavor - it doesn't make you that full."}
{"text":"I don't think I'd line up to get their taco, however, if there's no line (weekday evenings), I'd happy to get some. There's no space to eat in and most clients took the food out. Service is pretty friendly too."}
{"text":"Still dream about their fish tacos...delicious, reasonably priced and quick service. Will return!"}
{"text":"Very nice Taco place. I'd recommend the fish tacos. Unfortunately gets quite busy and there is limited searing  (one table only). Still a great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I really don't understand the rave for this place. Maybe it takes seven lives to come up with the money to afford to eat \"street-style\" tacos here. Each taco clocks in at a whopping $6 and a grown adult needs 3-5 to be adequately satiated.

I am from Southern California, I have eaten at Oscar's, and this does not come close to what one can expect from a fried fish taco. The breading here is way too heavy-handed and the perfect taco does not need a thick line of mayo to enhance its flavor. The rich, buttery texture of the fish itself should be enough lubricant for its journey down the esophagus.

The wait here is ridiculous and there aren't even enough sidewalks outside so by the time you find a spot to enjoy your extravagant street tacos in Kensington, they will be cold."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place out because of the hype. I got the Baja fish taco, shrimp taco and the mushroom taco, The tacos were ok. Honestly, nothing special. I've had way better in Toronto. We waited 20 minutes in line. They service is extremely slow. There are no bathrooms, no air conditioning and they charge you $0.20 cents for using debit when my bills was over $20.00. I found this weird for a establishment like this. Overall, I don't think I would come back. For the price, you can get better tacos at a sit down restaurant that actually serves you. I didn't feel this place is special and definitely not worth the wait when there are several other Mexican and taco places in the area."}
{"text":"Took us so long to find this place, but when we did, we ordered 1 of every taco and shared. We talk about this place to any visiting Toronto as a place to check out."}
{"text":"i had to come back and review again since i finally had the chance to get the famous taco they make. It was so yummy. i will forever compare all taco places to these. so much flavor, very good. I also had the mahi mahi, also nice; didn't love it as much but tasty.The sweet sauce was kind of got old fast. I also got the Baja one again it is also my favourite. i wanted to try the spicy shrimp, but was sold out....my bf got the same as me except he has octopus and said it was good, big chunks which was nice to see. i love this place. just need to find one closer to home."}
{"text":"Hands down best taco I've ever had in my life (and I've ate a lot of tacos).  We are from New Jersey and we visited Toronto for a weekend.  We went here because of the great reviews on yelp and it's something we will never stop talking about every time we get tacos."}
{"text":"Over the top delicious tacos! I am a huge taco fan and these are definitely some of the best (and uniquely flavoured) tacos I have had. Be prepared to wait for a while though, there's always a lineup out the door!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait when you get to this restaurant. But, trust me when I say that the wait is WORTH IT. 

These tacos are beyond unreal, and extremely filling. Dare I say, they are the best tacos I've ever had? I courageously ordered three tacos the first time I ate here, and couldn't finish the third, even though I desperately wanted to! I was honestly just way too full. I've tried the Baja fish tacos and the Gobernador, which is my favourite. I initially thought the ingredient combination was a bit odd - smoked tuna, grilled shrimp and cheese, but I decided to order it because of the yelp reviews mentioning it. This is the best taco I've ever had. The flavours are big, and the ingredients are fresh. 

I also love their fresh juices. Don't miss out on these either!! 

We will definitely keep coming back here."}
{"text":"Stood in line forever for this. Is this the only taco place in town? Im not impressed by their tacos. Kinda pricey for how small it was. But maybe bc im use to the the Mexican town in my area.

I got the ceviche &  thought it was ok. Just regular ceviche, nothing stands out for me. I also got tbe catch of the day,  and i felt like the fish had a weird taste but thats just me,  i have a sensitive taste bud. Was kinda disappointed by this place w all the hype. They also ran out of fresco when we got to our turn =( very busy place & I'm sure alot of ppl love it. Just not for me"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait and tight space. The Baja fish taco, salsas and guacamole are delicious. The place is in a cool area to explore too!"}
{"text":"OK --- as far as taste AND size AND value for money goes --- I award 7 Lives the best taco in Toronto.  Now that being said, every time I've gone by there is always a line-up and it is pretty cramped in ther"}
{"text":"Wowza, fish tacos in Toronto. Kensington Market seems determined to make sure I don't leave it until I'm stuffed full! I was lucky to come here on a chilly Sunday, and saw that the line didn't go out the door, like some other reviewers said. Inside, it's crazy busy with counters set up along the side, and only one table by the window with bench-style seating for 6. I love that they use a lot of live edge wood, for their counters, tables and benches - gorgeous!

The tacos are about $5 each, and there's a \"catch of the day\" option. BF and I opted to get 3 of them:  the Gobernador (smoked tuna, shrimp, cheese), Baja Fish (battered + deep fried Mahi Mahi with house sauce) and the COTD, which was snapper with mango sauce. Hands down, the Gobernador was the best. That CHEESE!!!! Though all three were pretty darn good too! My only gripe was that it disappeared too fast (sad face)

The wait was only 10 minutes for us to order, and about 15 minutes for the food to get to us. Luckier still, we snagged one of the seats by the window, and blissfully downed our tacos. They have hot sauce by the counter for you to further customize your taco. The \"dine-in\" option is an open taco on a plastic basket.

Cash only! So bring plenty of it, because you'll want more than one, guaranteed!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for quite some time now after hearing good things about it from friends. The tacos were amazing and I would definitely go back to try other menu items. This time I tried the Baja fish taco and the gobernador shrimp taco. I highly recommend the gobernador. It was full of flavour! 
The tacos were $5 each with tax already included in the pricing. I had two and i was stuffed. Their drinks are inexpensive as well. $1 for bottled water and $2 for Mexican soda. 
The only thing about this place is that it is a very small space with only one table, and a few table tops for standing. As well, this place is not open everyday. So make sure you check before you go! There were several occasions I wanted to head downtown to try, but they were closed. Also, try to find free parking around the area while you're down there. There is free parking for 1 hour."}
{"text":"For just $5 you can have amazingly delicious fresh prepared fish taco.  I wouldn't recommend ordering carnival here as their specialization is fish.   Their ceviche sells out fast so get there when they open. 

Love the staff there they're all friendly and easygoing. They handed me a few slips to make my own orders to just hand it to them when I order next time."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall place. Tiny place but worth the wait. The shrimp tacos were amazing."}
{"text":"Best taco's I have had in the city. Far better than places like Grand Electric or La Carnita, and much cheaper for what you get. 

Only downfall is that this is more of a take-out place, and nowhere to really sit (they have a few chairs in and outside). But if you are keen on getting some great tacos and not looking for a sit down meal, this is where you need to go.

Quick service, friendly staff who are more than willing to pass along some recommendations, and inexpensive. The tacos are quite big and they do not cheap out on ingredients. After two I am full. Prepared quickly and you can add your own amount of heat with the in house sauces available for you to add on. 

A definite stop for me every time I am in Kensington, or just craving some tacos :)"}
{"text":"Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos started out as a pop-up shop founded by Sean Riehl, but has since become a dominant force to be reckoned with in Kensington Market. Small crowds of people consistently line up here for a taste of Baja-style taco goodness on a daily basis.The Gobernador is one of the main draws, featuring smoked tuna, cheese, and scrumptious grilled shrimp. The whole taco lineup is quite stellar, to be honest.

A cash-only policy and limited seating aren't enough to discourage hungry Seven Lives fanatics. Background music and chatter among patrons and the friendly, outgoing staff here make for sufficient amusement while you anxiously await your order. 

Fresh ingredients and flamboyant flavour combinations make for a delicious meal that is hard to rival in the city. Tacos are approximately $5 each, and just two will fill a lot of space in your tummy. Spicy salsa is available and it's also quite good. You must try this place out at least once, whether you're from the city or just visiting."}
{"text":"The Gobernador was the best, and by far. If the lineups weren't so long, I'd make it a fact to go more often."}
{"text":"Seven life taco is the best taco place ever!  I refused to have taco until my boyfriend brought me here!  They are AWESOME!  I get the octapus taco every time I come here. 

However, when I came here last time, they used squid ink for taco shells. This time it was different, just normal tortilla shells."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall taco shop in Kensington with delicious tacos. Had the shrimp and fish tacos, loved it!"}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy! The best tacos in Toronto. My favourite is the Gobernator (smoked tuna, shrimp and cheese). The spices are perfect and the shrimp is nicely cooked. Fresh and authentic. The line ups are long but well worth the wait. I wish I could eat here every day; it's that good. Service is super friendly. Awesome possum! Pro-tip: Cash only. Pro-tip 2: Be ready to order. Nothing is worst than being an indecisive jerk and stalling the 45 min line. If you're not sure, go with the Gobernator."}
{"text":"This review is completely against the grain but I feel really mislead here. I had been waiting forever to try this place out and the hype has been everywhere.  Long time fans of Grand Electric we had high expectations for this joint. 

The service was pleasant. We ordered 1 catch of the day: snapper, 1 Mahi mahi, 1 Baja fish and 1 carnivals. The best was the baja fish .... everything else was just ok and the carnivals were crazy overly salted. The only thing I can say is that these tacos are damn huge and cheap. Lunch for 2 at 20but including a drink is amazing but I wasn't mind blown and we both just left with shrugged shoulders wondering what the big deal was. 

Sorry. Not sorry. Grand Electric still wins for ever."}
{"text":"--- Summary ---
Amazingly delicious authentic tacos here. I would definitely come back again.

--- Food ---
First time coming here, I tried the popular Gobernador for $5 (smoked marlin & shrimp and cheese). Super delicious, one taco for $5 is a good portion as well, quite filling!  

There are 3 spicy sauces to choose from (from mild to hot). The hot one is super spicy, add a little at a time or start with the milder versions. They have complementary ice and water if you'd like. 

--- Atmosphere ---
Note that there's only one table inside (6 seater). Also, no A/C inside the small establishment. But that's okay, as most people have it for take-out. Good service. Long line up, but it moved pretty quickly."}
{"text":"4-stars because, yes, I am a fan, but I'd find it difficult to say these are the best tacos I've had in Toronto. 

We decided to check it out, because it has great Yelp reviews and, well, there's a line-up if you go at pretty much any time of day. We were already in Kensington Market so we thought, why not? 

The line-up can be slightly intimidating, but we were in and able to order in probably under 15 minutes. The menu is pretty simple and consists primarily of different tacos, mainly (if not completely) seafood based. As far as I remember, they have shrimp, tuna, baja fish and octopus based tacos, but there are definitely a couple more.

We went with the Gobernador, which is shrimp and smoked tuna-based, and the Baja fish taco. We had to wait about 5-10 minutes for our order, then took the food to the nearby park to enjoy.

The tacos were good, pretty flavourful, slightly messy. A friend used the hot sauce they have on the counter on her tacos, and she said it was extremely spicy and made the taco difficult to eat, so be careful with that! If I had to choose, the Baja fish taco was probably slightly better than the Gobernador, but they were both great. Both tacos were $5 (cash only). 

Overall? Great, but probably not my favourite place for tacos. I can, however, understand the hype!"}
{"text":"Seven lives is awesome.  Try the Gobernador.  It's so good, you can't go wrong here, but the Gobernador is a cut above the rest of the tacos."}
{"text":"my favourite taco place in all of toronto!
they have super limited seating, friendly staff, and delicious food. it can get pretty busy at peak times but it's entirely worth it if you can find a seat in the restaurant or take them to go. 
the gobernador - which i had no idea how to pronounce the first few times - is DELICIOUS and for someone who isn't crazy about shrimp that's saying a lot.
they also serve juice/agua fresca (i believe we had watermelon-lime) for like $2 which was an awesome complement to the tacos!"}
{"text":"The tacos here are some of the best in Toronto, especially for the price (looking at you La Carnita). The service is great, but it can get crowded in the small restaurant. Expect to sit on a curb somewhere outside, but at least you will be surrounded by other taco lovers down in Kenginston Village."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick snack while walking through Kensington market, this is your place! For $5 you can get a delicious fish taco like mahi mahi or baja fish. I love octopus so I got the polpo taco and it was really yummy. They had run out of ceviche and from other Yelp reviews this seems to happen quite a lot- must be a popular choice. It's a small little snack place but there are stools so you can sit and devour your taco on the premises. If you're hungry, you might want to order 2 and then it's a bit more expensive. Kensington market is a really cool area with lots of vintage shops, coffee shops, juice stalls and places to eat- definitely worth checking out if you're visiting Toronto!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I didn't have The Gobernador or any of their other seafood tacos.. but I was not impressed. I ordered the Carnita which I had to wait 10 minutes for, despite the fact it wasn't busy at all. 

The service was very terse and unfriendly which really did not endear me to the experience. 

The taco was ok. The slow-cooked pork wasn't very tender and didn't seem fresh. Aside from that I discovered a ridiculously large hunk of white fat in the middle of my food which sort of grossed me out. 

Honestly, I've been to La Carnita twice and both times it was to die for. The sort of food that makes to collapse a little as it hits your tongue. La Carnita is also 5 dollars a taco, which I don't mind paying for as its a sit down place, unlike Seven Lives.

It just didn't do it for me"}
{"text":"All I have to say is the food was freeking nice The Baja fish is just sweet 
I will be going back for more."}
{"text":"Just a quick update - after a brief closure due to plumbing issues a week and a half ago that lasted only days, but was frankly unbearably long for this Seven Lives addict, the team threw open the doors again and did so with not one, but two Catch Of The Day items that are worth noting!

Previous Catch-Of-The-Days included the salmon with tamarind sauce, which does brief stints on and off as a fully-fledged item on the regular menu, and a shark which may be the only misstep I've ever tasted here.  There's been tuna, but I've missed it every time it's been around.

Anyways, this past week they offered Rock Sole Tacos and Haddock Tacos, which if they've been offered before, I've never been so lucky as to encounter.  I'm not usually a sole fan - I often find it to be a bit too fishy for my tastes.  Not this sole though, which while flavorful was perfectly balanced with guacamole, diced red onion, tomato, and a little crema.  The flavor was substantial, but not overpowered, and the fish was cooked to a pleasant firm texture with plenty of grilled-bit goodness at the edge of each succulent morsel.  Very good.

But the haddock!  Ohhhh, the haddock!  Fluffy pieces of diaphanous white flesh, mild in flavor but delicious, and grilled to a delightful crisp on the exterior of each piece.  The fish was cooked perfectly.  It was doused in what was either a lime crema, or a basic crema then spritzed with lime.  While the sole carried just a drizzle, there was a fair amount here lending a cool and creamy zing to frame the crisp pillows of haddock.  A bit of Guacamole and tomato lent more framing, while sliced strings of red onion brought another level of crunch, playing nicely with the crema and the fish.

Call ahead.  Ask if they have the haddock.  If they have it, go get it.  God, I wish I was eating it right now."}
{"text":"Tacos are packed full of flavour, the only other tacos in Canada that rivals seven lives is my Mexican friend's home made tacos. 

The experience is further enhance as you watch passersby watch with envy as you chow down on those delicious juicy tacos and make a big mess of your face."}
{"text":"BEST TACO OF MY LIFE---

This is no joke. Tacos have recently become my obsession, and when I heard this place had \"great fish tacos\", I knew they must have other \"great\" tacos too. Because I hate fish. 

So with high hopes I ventured into Seven Lives, and lo and behold there on the menu was CARNITAS TACO. With no hesitation at all I ordered and was more than satisfied with the delicious arrangement of tortilla, pork prepared to perfection, avocado, and other yummies. They had some stone bowls on the counter full of hot, med, and mild sauces. I chose hot and med because what's the point of mild. Lime slices we also available for the taking, of which I did indulge. 

All I can say is that I really love tacos, and if you really love tacos you should go here. AND if you really love sea food you will probably like this place better than me."}
{"text":"I've tried most of the menu now and have yet to be disappointed. My favorite is the ceviche and the octopus taco. Great value for your price and overall very yummy!

For those of you who have never been, the store is very small and only has one table with seating for around 6 (if you're open to getting real personal with your neighbors). There are ledges for eating on around the perimeter of the restaurant, but those are always packed too. Great for a casual bite to eat bit definitely reconsider if you're looking to impress your date's parents"}
{"text":"Delicious! The octopus tacos are to die for. This place is lined up for a reason!"}
{"text":"Seven Lives has AMAZING fish tacos, get that for sure!

Weekends can be fairly packed, although they do have bar-style tables for you to work on your food."}

{"text":"I had been wanting to try out Seven Lives Tacos since it opened...

I was never lucky: Either I was downtown on the days that it was closed. And one time I was here on a Wednesday which it supposed to be open but it was closed for renovation! 

And finally I made it here...  But I had an upset stomach from the fried chicken I ate earlier for brunch.... why me!!!

I admired the Blackened Mahi Mahi Taco that my friend ordered for me. It looked delicious and sadly my stomach was turning. The torillas looked soft and chewy. The fish was grilled without heavy batter, just the way I liked mine. 

I guess I needed to come back again next time when I am in Kensington Market. I promised myself while I watched my friend ate my taco..."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos but the lineup is usually horrendous. Baja fish was my favourite. Go if you can get in without waiting too long."}
{"text":"Seven Lives is delicious. There's always a line and for good reason. 

Their seafood is a must try! The baja, octopus, or mahi mahi, or haddock are all good. You don't get quite full off one, or two, or three though so be sure to order a variety of things. Still a cash only shop and the place is pretty small, if you want a seat, good luck. I'd recommend grabbing a couple and eating it while exploring the rest of Kensington."}
{"text":"Yes! Come here for seafood tacos, fruit infused water and ceviche! 

My personal fav is the gobernador which contains smoked tuna. For $5 you can grab a loaded seafood taco. Try it with their salsas as well. They do sell out and are busy on the weekends so be prepared to wait. As well, there is not much seating inside."}
{"text":"So good. Amazing. best fish taco, hands down. Stop reading yelp reviews and just go eat a damn taco!"}
{"text":"This place is actually a hidden (literally) gem as it is in a bakery store with a bunch of other restaurants so do not look for Seven Lives Taco outside because you won't find it.

Once you enter the interior is very cramped and quaint. There is a small chalkboard menu with some of the greatest tacos I've ever had. I got the Blackened Mahi Mahi and the Pork Belly for $8 dollars no tax. There was a jar of green liquid with a bunch of limes which was the cucumber lime juice and it's a dollar for a cup. I didn't try it myself but I will next time! The tacos looked really small so I was kind of disappointed at first but once I took my first bite my eyes rolled back into my head and I kept telling my friend through all the taco in my mouth that \"THIS IS AMAZING!!!\" Once he took a bite of his he had the same reaction. The two tacos actually filled me up. 

Oh there aren't any seats except for two tables in the back which all the restaurants in that building share. 

But anyway you HAVE TO GO!!"}
{"text":"They need to lighten up on the cheese and sauces. The meat and fish are fresh and well-seasoned/marinated so there's no reason to drown it in a litre of oddly creamy mole. Tacos are still fantastic but less would be more."}
{"text":"So picture this: one Asian girl walking down the streets of Chinatown holding a takeout container of tacos in one hand while voraciously and shamelessly stuffing her face with tacos with the other. This is what Seven Lives reduced me to today. No, it wasn't my first visit (how could I legitimately call myself a Toronto foodie otherwise?) but my last one was during my pre-Yelp days, so I thought I needed a refresher. Trust me, I won't be forgetting this experience anytime soon...

THE PULPO (OCTOPUS) TACO DOE. I picked up a chunk of octopus first and just ate it and my eyes bugged out in pure shock and delight. Then taking my first bite of the actual taco... just pure ecstasy. I was walking down the street in Kensington Market and I couldn't even control myself, I just had to close my eyes and let my eyes roll into the back of my head without any regard for my safety or oncoming traffic. The octopus was perfectly grilled, so juicy, so flavourful, so chewy, so delightful, so heavenly. The sauce and the celery and cilantro in the taco perfectly complimented the octopus. They also filled up that taco REAL GOOD with octopus... it was falling out of my taco and all over the place (luckily just into my takeout box, not a SINGLE chunk of octopus was wasted on my watch!) but I loved it. More more more more more my stomach begged.

The Gobernador which I had afterwards was good, but for me all the flavours kind of blended in together - the sauce, the shrimp, the cheese, etc. It was pretty tasty but I would have liked it more if the individual flavours were more discernible or more complex. Also I was still riding the high from that octopus, so I guess nothing else could just compare. Still, a solid choice off the menu.

I also love that the tacos are double-shelled.... MMM more of that corn-y, dough-y, carb-y goodness, I like that. Great texture, not too thick but not too flimsy, and not too dry.

At $5+tax/taco I think it's a bit pricier even compared to some of the sit-down restaurants, but whatever, I'll gladly pay $5 to experience that sheer joy again. I've eaten a lot of good food around this city, but haven't felt that level of satisfaction in a while. I'll be back for you, my precious pulpo!!!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I trekked here during a winter storm and needless to say, it was SO worth it! They were closing early for the night because of the weather, but said they'd finish up our order and then close the kitchen. The staff was also very helpful in making suggestions. Amazing service!
I tried the Blackened mahi mahi and Gobernador tacos. Both were delicious in their own unique way.
The Blackened mahi mahi tasted sweet and sour. I love that flavour combination so I really liked this. Moreover, I think the mayo or cream sauce toned down the flavours so it wasn't too overwhelming.
The Gobernador taco had shrimp, tuna and tasted distinctly spicy-sour. Usually, I exercise my sweet buds but this was also superb!
For $5 a taco it isn't expensive. But like another person mentioned, you will need at least 2 to be filled. However, they are generous and load up the taco so expect spillage as you eat it. Furthermore, the taco shell itself was very unique. The taco was soft, but appeared to have 2 layers so it made it easier to grab all those goodies without breaking.
Loved this place and the food. My only bone to pick is that they should have more seating available. Tacos are a bit messy, so I'd prefer having napkins around when I mess myself up."}
{"text":"I love octopus, which is tako in japanese, so a taco of tako seemed like the right thing to do... To be honest, the celery with the octo was not my cup of tea. The blackened catfish was tasty. The pork w pineapple was splendid. Great corn tortilla. Love Kensington."}
{"text":"Wow!! Mind blowing flavour!! I had the gobernador and I loved it. Though a bit pricier than other local taco places the taste was amazing. 
At $6 per taco you are paying dine in price for a take out meal. That being said the food itself is better than most dine in. 
Your call. 
Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"If you want real tacos than seven lives is the place to go. Now I'm not much of a fan of seafood. Seven lives has officially changed that. The first time I tried the spicy Diablo shrimp and I think I died. I went back and tried the Baja fish and boy did I die again. For those of you who enjoy spice and good kick this is a must try. Their perfect blend of spice and salts is like a party on your tonque, and the sauces are the perfect touch. That line is so worth the wait. For a small busy place it's fast, friendly and very clean. This is a definate must try for seafood lovers and non seafood lovers. Seven lives has created a true gastronomical experience for tacos."}
{"text":"I moved to Toronto about six weeks back and of all the places I ve food explored, seven lives remains to be on the top five of my favorites. The tacos here reiterate my belief that keeping  food simple is the best way to anyone's heart."}
{"text":"Came on Friday after work and it was pretty packed. It's a little dinky looking taco shop. Didn't have to wait long to get your order but the cashier girl was super rude and had attitude. I got two tacos, baha fish, and some other taco of the day, it was peppered fish and super spicy. They have quite a variety of tacos to choose from. They costed around 4.50 each. They accept only cash and debit. They have a few sauces for you to pick from at the counter to put on your taco separately. 

Maybe I'm not a taco expert but I didn't find the tacos particularly special. I thought they were alright, has quite a bit of seasoning and really messy to eat lol, prepare to grab lots of napkins. The waiting time for the tacos felt like it took foreverrrrr. The two tacos were pretty big in portion I think and it was enough to fill me up. 

There's no where to really sit except for one small table enough to fit 5-6 people and it tends to be communal. There's places where you can stand to eat too."}
{"text":"Service was great. It's super packed and they close early but the workers are super friendly. After seeing the reviews, I got super excited to try the tacos. It was really good but maybe because of the crazy hype, I expected mind-blowing tacos. If you go in there with low expectations, it's great. But I don't see much difference in the taste with other well-known taco places. FYI I had the mahi mahi"}
{"text":"Toronto deserves a good taco joint, and Seven Lives' fish tacos are good enough. 

I ordered a Blackened Mahi Mahi taco, a Gobernator taco and a ceviche.  Both tacos came in double soft corn tortilla.  I liked that the Mahi Mahi fillet was grilled not fried, and that the fillet was big enough to provide fish taste and texture to the taco, as opposed to some tacos that the garnishment overwhelms the fish.  The garnishment here was fresh and fine, not great.  The Gobernator is Seven Lives' house taco.  It is like The Works, meaning a lot of ingredients and flavours.  The one I had, the smoked tuna was quite salty.  I didn't taste the shrimps.  I really liked how big this taco was.  Two of these would make a meal for me.  The ceviche was not flavored in a way I like a ceviche.  This was not the balance of flavours that I am used to.  Some might enjoy it more than me.

What I really like is that the fish is the focal point of the taco.  There is a lot of garnishment in both tacos.  It makes the tacos more enjoyable yet not overshadows the fish. Great that Seven Lives hits the balance of ingredients.  Could the fish taco be better?  The garnishment could have a hint of acidity or I could have sprinkled more lime juice.  They could use garnishment that has more texture, yet I prefer simple garnishment anyway, so this is not a big deal to me.  And maybe if the fish is fresher, but this is not possible as long as Seven Lives use Mahi Mahi, which, to the best of my knowledge, is a Caribbean/west coast fish.  So yeah, this taco joint is good enough.  And rocking it at $5 each is a deal compared to some Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos is still delicious after all these years. There was a special ceviche ($7) at the store that day. It was slightly too acidic for me. However, still a party in your mouth - fresh guacamole, cucumber, tomato, seafood, pickled vegetable and herb! 

Can't complain."}
{"text":"Just great food.  Not much room to sit, but it's the best taco take-out place I've been."}
{"text":"I have been reading my fellow yelpers raving reviews of Seven Lives (which my darling friend calls \"Seven Sisters\" for some strange reason) for a while now, so I was super psyched to finally check it out today. Yes, it's insanely busy, yes it's pretty much standing room only (they have one table with enough seating for six but standing room for around ten) but the tacos... Omg the tacos. My gold standard in T.O is Barrio Coreano but I'd like to announce my new favourite taco is from Seven Lives. I had the Gobernador and the Octopus tacos. Each taco was $5 and to be honest I was so stuffed I couldn't finish my meal. Now you may be asking yourself - why only four stars if you just said it's the best taco in town? Excellent question. If I'm rating an experience as a whole, having to stand and eat tacos is very difficult, and in this day and age if you're going to charge five dollars a taco you should consider being more than just a cash-only establishment. I get it, it's Kensington and it's busy and maybe I'm just being picky ... but I'm allowed to be. 

tl;dr - best taco in town."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. Hands down one of the best on the go fast food taco joints in the area. You're not coming here for the seating, service  or the atmosphere...you're coming to grab a bite and take it with you. With respect to that, they've really nailed it! 

This place is a go to for me..especially in the summer months. One I keep coming back to. Tacos made..simply. Which is exactly how they should be executed. This is street food. Point blank. That's what makes it so lovable.

Also...you're in the market EXPECT to pay cash!!!"}
{"text":"Bad service bad service bad service!!!!!!
Totally discriminative. Refused to take order for 8 people, everybody present in line. Can't believe it. Sorry a$$ whole we can't change our skin color for your tacos."}
{"text":"Cheap tacos. I mean, cheap AND deliciously tasty. This place is definitely a gem.

First, a warning: this restaurant is not a sit down and chill place. There's actually only one table, so you have to be very lucky to have it. No, what you want to do is get your tacos and drinks and go sit somewhere outside, enjoying the sun.

We've tried the Baja fish (amazing!), the blackened mahi, the gobernador... or, if you feel real dirty, the pork belly taco. Yummy!

Bonus points for selling Mexican Coke. Pretty rare here in Canada, Mexican Coke is a treat. For those who aren't in the know, Mexican Coke is still manufactured using sugar cane rather than high fructose corn syrup. Makes a huge difference in taste. I very rarely drink Coke, only whenever I have a chance to have the Mexican version.

If you're in the Kensington area market, stop by and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good service and amazing food. Seriously the best tacos I've ever had - and they're a great size too. A must for anyone with a love for tacos"}
{"text":"Seven Lives is not your typical Mexican restaurant or your local Taco Bell. In my opinion they serve one of the best tacos in Toronto. It is located at Kensington market in the heart of Downtown, I grew up there so it gave me a lot of memories when I visited. It is a place people must try and visit, especially in the summer. I had the Carnitas taco, Spicy Shrimp taco, and the Poke 'N' Chips, alongside with their homemade lemonade. All the flavours went well together, and it was one of the best tacos I had like I stated before. I enjoy the Poke 'N' Chips a lot, the flavours wet very well together and it also came with fresh salmon. The price was reasonable for the portion that was given, and each bite I had was very delicious. One downside about this place is that it closes really early, and it is always hard to get to downtown during rush hour just to make it for these tasty tacos. Another bad thing about this place is it is not really dine-in friendly, there is barely any room to move around in the restaurant. This is why I recommend to go in the summer with the nice weather you can enjoy it outside the restaurant. Overall, with their friendly staffs, and tasty food I will most likely come back. 

Environment: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Food: 5/5
Drinks: 5/5

Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"Food: I love the tacos here - probably the best in the city! The only reason I didn't give them a 5/5 is the limited vegetarian selection - the mushroom cactus taco is delicious but I'd love a bit of variety once in a while. The ingredients are definitely fresh - so fresh that they can run out if you visit at the end of the day.

Service and atmosphere: It is a TINY place that is always full, with only one shared table and some standing room. Be prepared to get cozy with some strangers or be eating on the street. Especially difficult since the tacos are overflowing and can be quite messy... Also, beware - they only take cash."}
{"text":"I had my first ever taco here and now I'm s big fan of tacos because of them although I can't find better ones in NYC. 

Staff was fun and very nice, the place is cute and small. Just love it!"}
{"text":"This place was super crowded when I had gone during the summer but it was worth the wait. For the price you pay, you get pretty good portion and you get a choice of 3 different hot sauces/salsa to put on your taco if you'd like. 
The octopus taco and the Gobernador both were really tasty and made fresh to order.
Only con is that there is really limited seating and they only take cash. Other than that, I would definitely come here again! :)"}
{"text":"I was with a group and we were looking for great eats during our short stay in Toronto. This was by far one of the best places we could have possibly found! We most definitely got a bang for our buck!

The tacos are extremely flavorful, and a mouthful of yum. The menu choice isn't large but you really can't go wrong with anything. I had the fried mahi taco which was superb! This is not your average taco place.

Do make sure that your prepared to wait in line, and if you end up as the caboose just know that it will all be worth it in the end!

P.S. Make sure to get three tacos if you want a full meal!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Great spot. Small and quick for tacos! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"So delicious and they were super accommodating to my dairy intolerance! They were super busy at lunch though and we had to wait awhile to get our food (1 hour)."}
{"text":"What to try?

Their tacos. (More than 7 taco varieties though!!)

It's a very simple menu and I tried the first one on the menu. The Gobenador. The service was fast even though there was a line up and it is a very small shop. Not a lot of seats available inside but ppl were in and out pretty quick. Def not a place to just sit and chat for long periods of time. I thought it was nice they gave you two taco wraps for each order. It's almost like they knew you might need a second wrap to keep the sauce and ingredients in the taco. I thought the gobernador was alright. Wasn't wowing but it was good for its price. Nothing really stood out for me with the taco even though the server said it was their most popular one. It wasn't a gourmet meal so I shouldn't be too picky. It was def unique in the sense that it was a taco you can't find a lot elsewhere where it's a grab and go kind of soft taco unless you go to El Catrin or  La Carnita. I think the next time I go, I'll try the fried baja fish. 

Last tip? 

Bring cash! No credit card unfortunately. Don't forget to add the additional sauces that are on the counter giving your taco the extra kick it needs for a tastier bite."}
{"text":"Plus:
The food is good
The staff is nice.

Minus:
Tacos are quite overpriced. 
There's usually a lot of line up and no enough space to seat."}
{"text":"I like their tacos, full of flavor and quite big. There are usually line-ups and very little seating so consider eating in the park."}
{"text":"Hands down best tacos I've had. There isn't much seating area, you're lucky if you get the bench.. otherwise there is a stand against one of the walls or 2 benches outside the storefront. This place is CASH only and tacos are $6 before tax. I would get full from two tacos. Baja taco is my favourite one! I would come back for sure if I'm around the Kensington area. 
Should go when it's not peak hours, line up can get pretty crazy!"}
{"text":"Tiny restaurant primarily for takeout. They have 1 table and few counter space. $6 tacos, any flavour. Line up out the door but moves quickly. I had the fish taco which was fried halibut. The batter was crispy and not greasy. The topping was really refreshing and complimented the fish. My friend had the octopus taco and really enjoyed it as well. I'll have to return and try the other tacos."}
{"text":"My first lunch in Toronto!! I was surprised that there was a short line before it opened at noon on Thursday. The food must be good :). 

We ordered the Gobernador and blackened mahi mahi. It was delicious. The filling was creative (sort of fusion tasting) and well seasoned. It was a nice welcome meal for me. I enjoyed every bite I took and it left me craving for more. Service was fast, I got my food in less than 5 mins. If I could, I would try all the tacos there :D. 

One thing I negative I would say is that I think it is slightly overpriced. The amount of food I got doesn't justify $6 per taco. We had to stop and get nuggests on the way back home. Even so, I enjoyed my experience here."}
{"text":"Came on Sunday when they have the pedestrian street for the market. Ordering was smooth and the person taking my order was pleasant. There was no wait at all.

But when I got my food (I ordered four things), I asked for a container because I had to bring it back to my group around the corner and I couldn't carry the food in four separate paper plates. The person bringing out the tacos was a complete asshole. He refused to give me containers, and outright lied saying that they didn't have any containers. I was speechless and another patron even tried to help me by saying that he saw the containers in the window. This guy still would not help at all! So I asked him just for a bag at least so I could stack up the paper plates so I could at least carry the food back, and he finally went in and threw two containers at me and huffed away. COMPLETELY RUDE and unnecessary.

I understand that Sunday is different because of the market, but that's no reason to act so disgustingly to a paying customer! And it wasn't even busy. I was honestly shocked at how this guy acted.

Aside from that, the specials for that day were the squid ink and fish taco and taquito. Both were mehhhh and wayyy too expensive at $5 each."}
{"text":"I heard other Yelpers rave about Seven Lives and had to come and try it. I had the shrimp and the octopus tacos. They were $6 each, which I thought was a little pricey considering that it was a sit down restaurant. When I get the tacos however I can see why they were pricey. The tacos were very generous sizes with a lot of shrimp and octopus. The blue corn tortilla was double layered and very flavourful though I'm not sure if the blue corn is what they normally serve. There's a salsa station on the side where you can add things to your liking. I liked the shrimp one more than the octopus but both were excellent. I was decently full after only 2 tacos. 

Tip: it's cash only, there's not a lot of seating, usually a line."}
{"text":"Tacos were the bomb! Loved the blackened Mahi mahi and the other varieties. I wish they would've mentioned how large they were and I could've saved a bit of money and carrying around the full taco I didn't finish. 2 is more than enough as I'm a smaller girl. The place is small but cute and they play throwbacks that me and my friend were jamming to while we ate the deliciousness! The girl at the counter was friendly-ish. A bit pointed in the way she spoke considering the vibe of the place. Also a bit condescending. Sucks they were out of the homemade lemonade but overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"Worth the line up. Worth the cramped interior. The tacos are absolutely bonkers. I normally go with the grilled octopus and roll the dice on the catch of the day. I've introduced a number of friends to this place and each has been impressed. Definitely going back for more....hopefully tomorrow."}
{"text":"Let me just say, this is my current favourite taco place in Toronto. No bougie vibes here, and the lack of seating is kinda great. I read that they were trying to capture the west coast taco stand picture, and it has come across well. 

+Love the double shell
+Prices are great for how huge the tacos are

-Tacos are actually so big it's hard for those with small hands and small mouths to eat this. I support this, but it also kinda sucks when all the meat is falling out of the taco. It can be messy!
-The ingredients aren't as fresh as the west coast. I didn't really need to state the obvious on this. You can't mess with the west coast sun.


Like I said, current favourite taco place."}
{"text":"TACOS! TACOS! TACOS! 

My chant when tacos are for dinner.

They were a bit over price but definitely worth it!! They were packed with flavors and overstuffed with ingredients!

I ordered the spicy grilled chicken taco. It came with guacamole, sour cream and pickled carrots. That taco was overpacked with so much yummy chicken that my double layer corn tortilla broke! That's how you know it was the bomb.com

On the side they had three different flavor and levels of salsas: mild, medium and hot.

The hot definitely was SPICY, but made the tacos even better. 

Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"These might be the best tacos in the city! The fish and shrimp tacos were to die for. We stood at the shelves along the wall to eat, which was fine for grabbing a bite while exploring Kensington Market. That place seems to always be busy, so be prepared to wait about 20 minutes total."}
{"text":"They should really consider renaming this place \"Siete Vidas\" 

Anyways, located in the Kensington Market on Kensington Ave. right next to Rasta Pasta (review coming soon). As all the other spots in this area, it gets kind of stuffy in there, but they hook it up with hand sanitizer, I love any place that does that. 

Tacos

The Gobernador: Is this really named after Arnold? Anyways, I must admit at first taste the rating made sense. You get it all, the shrimp, marlin and cheese. As you eat more though, you begin to dissect the freshness of the ingredients and the shrimp lacked it. 

The Black Pepper Marlin: Dull. Needed more flavor attached to it. Although the marlin itself was more fresh than the shrimp. 

Agua

De Jamaica: Needed more concentration, light in taste and flavor.

Recommendations...

Change the name, change your shrimp distributor, add more flavor to marlin taco, more hibiscus to the hibiscus drink, a long shot with this one but go with handmade tortillas?  

Don't get me wrong this place isn't bad, but things would be a lot better if I was running this taco shop. The base is there though, it really is.

P.S. Your salsas are actually pretty good"}
{"text":"Each taco has unique flavors.  I had the Gobernador which has smoked Marlin (yummy) and the Camarones (spicy shrimp)  These tacos are made with soft thin tortilla's and they have a lot of sauce so they are hard to handle.  I ended up using a fork to pick up most toppings that fell out.   This is definitely a place to check out for a Taco fan."}
{"text":"Baja Fish Taco: fish size was good, the batter is on the thicker crunchier side, and it came with lots of fresh veggie toppings.

Pulpo a la Mexicana Taco: the octopus meat was really well seasoned and had almost a smokey taste to it. There was a good amount of meat and the fresh leafy vegg toppings with the creamy sauce complimented it well.

Overall, i found the 2 tortilla per Taco to be quite thick (even individually), there was lots of toppings and seasoned well, but $6/taco is quite steep. 

The place itself is crammed most times and there was limited seating and no containers for the salsas. 

I'll most likely come back to try some more, but I've definitely had better tacos elsewhere"}
{"text":"We were in Kensington on Sunday and the restaurant/fast food location was lined up out the door and the line never got smaller because people just kept coming for the tacos.

We were down in Kensington Wednesay and it was lunchtime so we dicided to try it. The line up was crazy and the wait to order was about 15 minutes, then about 10 minutes to get the food. Well worth the wait.

I had the Gonernador and my husband had the blackend mahi mahi. Both were outstanding. Jam packed with food and if you want extra spice, there are pots on the front counter.
$5.00 each. What an inexpensive lunch for two.

We will definately go back to this take out restaurant."}
{"text":"So tasty!! Tried one shrimp taco and one fish. At first I was thinking that for the price they were awfully small, but it was packed with dleliciousness."}
{"text":"tasty tacos with generous portions and a good price. What more could you want? Maybe some more seating, but it is a small storefront, so what can you do?

The tacos are great, which then makes me have a hard time choosing because I love them all. But the gobernador taco is pretty tasty. Prices include tax, which is nice. Staff is all friendly, and they can make some changes to most of the tacos to accommodate food allergies (i.e. no dairy or gluten)."}
{"text":"The gobernator (smoked marlin and shrimp) taco was disappointing."}
{"text":"Was walking through the Kensington and passed by! My boyfriend and I had a taco each, as there weren't really places to sit and we just wanted to have a quick bite. I had the beef tongue and beef head meat taco and my boyfriend had the grilled octopus. THEY WERE AMAZINg. The taco was such a good portion and crazy flavourful. They pack so much meat into the taco! A definite try but keep in mind there isn't much space to sit!"}
{"text":"One of my fav taco spots. My must order are the fish tacos!! Don't forget to add that spicy kick"}
{"text":"Get here early the lines can be long. I've been here a few times and have only order their famous Gobenator shrimp tacos and they are a explosion of flavor. Do forget to dress it up with their house made hot sauces on the side  of the counter for those that can handle the heat.

The only small issue  I have  is  their Tortilla skins. I know they  double their skins to help with breakage, but the crazy amount of toppings they put on which I love doesn't help the skins from getting soggy and breaking and it gets messy at that point. I guess the key is eat them right away  not way like 30 mins later. 

Overall solid tacos for $5"}
{"text":"Came here from New York, and I saw that this restaurant was highly liked so I went to check it out. I ordered the Blackened Mahi Mahi togo. The taco was the average size, and not super stuffed. The taste was decent. It did not have that seafood taste for some reason. I would come again if I had a chance to try other foods on the menu, but this was just okay for me. I love your guacamole though!"}
{"text":"Fucking delicious. 
Best fish tacos I've ever had. Long lines are worth it. Obviously there's a seating issue, so don't expect to be comfortable--especially in the winter."}
{"text":"Poke is on the rise... so why not try the one here?

Recently tried the \"Poke on Chips\" and it was a huge portion, and served with deliciously marinated salmon. Not your traditional poke, as this is served on nacho chips, and special sauce, and their amazing guac. But it is oh so good.

All thoughts from previous review still stands! Still love 'em."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in Kensington for grabbing a quick lunch. The portion size is generous given the price. The food is fresh and full of flavour. Don't be late else you'll find them closed!"}
{"text":"Very nice - I'm very happy to have finally made it here because I'd been craving a good fish taco like crazy!  

The tacos here are $5 each, double-tortilla-ed, and sort of on the small side.  I need to eat 3 to be full, but then again, I have a massive appetite.

I liked the agua fresca (and the price is right at $2/cup).  The first time I had pineapple - it was nice and refreshing, though it kinda reminded me of sweetened, diluted pineapple juice (which I guess is what agua fresca is, anyway).  I liked the chunks of pineapple pulp, though the superthin straws made it kinda hard to drink.

The next time I had a hisbiscus agua fresca.  Interesting, although it didn't taste floral at all - it tasted more like a slightly tart stone fruit, like plum or something.  It was ok.

Here's the rundown of the tacos I've tried:

Baja Fish - Tasty, and they were pretty generous with the amount of fish inside, which was nice.  The batter was beautifully seasoned, which made them stand out because a lot of places that serve fried fish don't do so.  I felt that the batter could have been thinner, however.  I liked the condiments and veggies inside - shredded cabbage and a couple sauces.  This was good.

Gobernador - The smoked fish and the shrimp worked well together.  Smoked fish in a taco was totally new to me and I liked it.  The shrimp was fresh and good quality.

Camarones al Diablo - The spicy shrimp was nice.  I didn't see the face of God, as a previous Yelper attested, but I really liked it.  The sauce was savoury, slightly tart, and a little bit spicy.  I also love how fresh and high quality the shrimp was.  I really dislike how some places have brined/baking soda-ed shrimp, which makes the texture weird.  The shrimp here is dense and fresh and meaty.

Pulpo - The octopus was very nice!  Grilled to perfection and not overcooked to a rubbery mess, which is very easy to do.  There was plenty of octopus inside, which I really appreciated, and it was simply and delicously spiced.

Catch of the Day (Red Snapper) - Probably my favourite.  It was spiced to perfection, grilled just right, and beautifully flaky.  There was also a generous amount of fish inside.  Loved this so much.

Tips:
*cash only
*they sell out of certain ones and lineups can be long - go at odd hours if you want a seat and go early if you want to be able to choose any item
*apparently dogs are not allowed in the restaurant
*unless you're a heavy smoker/have no nerves, I wouldn't go for the hot sauce - it was so hot I couldn't taste anything afterwards, even after I skimmed it off my taco! @.@
*it can get messy, but luckily they have forks, wet naps, and plenty of serviettes available

I hope to try their ceviche one day!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Went in the summer time, which is the only time I would recommend as the restaurant had no place to sit or stand so you just have to take your food outside. Worth the wait. The ceviche was the best I've had. All the tacos we tried were delicious. Then take a walk down the street to the churro place."}
{"text":"Mouthwatering tacos filled with so much flavor that will leave you wanting even more! A hidden gem found in the heart of Kensington market in downtown Toronto, Seven Lives is a must visit if you're in the area! 

I had the pollo (chicken) taco since the beef and pork were sold out, but wow was it delicious! Sure it was a bit messy to eat but flavor and texture of the chicken with the soft tacos with their special sauce was such a treat to devour! I'd recommend having one taco for a snack, two tacos for a medium meal, and three tacos if you're famished! Best go with friends so you can each try ordering something different and share a bite. 

Because this is a small, sidewalk style restaurant, expect a line up stretching out the door. Second, there usually isn't enough space to eat inside so best grab enough napkins, then eat outside and enjoy fresh air! That's a dining experience you can \"taco\" 'bout with friends! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Good place to fill your gut after a night of drinking.Tacos are actually are big and hard ...unlike in Meeeko where it soft and easier to handle. Oh well, we're only about 500000km from Zijuatanejo. I support this, but it also kinda sucks when all the meat is falling out of the taco. It can be messy...but who cares? I'm half smashed when I come here anyways.-A current favourite taco place."}
{"text":"WOW!!! Seven Lives is nothing short of amazing. I selfishly held off on reviewing this place for a while because the word was getting out way too fast and with it the huge lineups at peak hours, now I've just decided never to eat their at peak hours.
These guys are worth the wait though and will blow you away with some of the best tacos I have ever had. I know that the taco has become very trendy as of late and that a few places in the city are serving up some great tacos but none are as amazing as Seven Lives. I have officially worked through the entire menu and I can honestly say that you can't go wrong no matter what you decide to order but the Blackened Mahi Mahi and the Smoked Marlin and Shrimp are not to be missed.
My only problem with this place is that it's so close to my work that I find myself eating here 3 to 4 times a week."}
{"text":"Yo this is the business. As I mentioned before I am a taco connoisseur. The tacos here meet my high fvckin standards. Me and my girl got pretty much a sample of the whole menu. We got 2 spicy shrimp 1 tuna and shrimp 1 Baja fish and 1 blackened fish taco. All of them were on point. They were authentic gourmet. They were pretty big tacos for corn tortillas and 2 will fill you up for sure. They only con is they are expensive at $5 a pop. Other than that they were excellente."}
{"text":"Great tacos. $6 each but they put a good amount of meat/seafood, have tried most of them and all worth it IMO.
Cash only and small sweaty shop though"}
{"text":"This review is for Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos, (416) 393-4636, 69 Kensington Avenue, Toronto, ON M5T 2K2.  

Now these are REAL tacos.  Not that cardboard stuff you get from what is slopped in a bucket at Taco Bell.  I have never heard of this place but I like stirring up conversations and while renovating my home, during lunch time I was eating with the trades people and we were talking about some of the best restaurants in Toronto.  And the only restaurant that had 2 different trades agree on (the A/C and railing installers) was that Seven Lives Tacos has the the best tacos in town.

Just take a look at some pics from their site at http://sevenlives.restaurantsnapshot.com/ and you can see that the pictures just explode with taste --- and the way it looks is exactly how it is . . . out of this world!

While I am at it, kudos to the trades that recommended Seven Lives Tacos to me.  They were:

Toronto Air Conditioning & Furnace Repair, 35 Ormskirk Ave., Toronto, ON M6S 1A8, 416-962-5678, www.acandfurnace.com.  They list themselves as doing air conditioning repairs in Toronto, furnace service and stuff.

And the other guys were from Toronto Custom Railings, 111 Elizabeth St.,  Toronto ON M5G 1P7, 416-451-5052. www.torontocustomrailings.com.  They list themselves as doing glass railings in Toronto, railings in Etobicoke and such.

Because of their recommendations I now have a new favorite for tacos which I desperately needed because I used to live in Los Angeles and as you can imagine they had some outstanding tacos there, but I could never quite find anything to compare in Toronto.  But now I did and I am one happy camper because I an crazy about Latino food."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos in all of Toronto, if not all of Canada. Seven Lives is a small shop in the middle of Kensington Market surrounding by countless of top rated spots. However, through it all, Seven Lives stands out as the very best. Here's why:

1) Food: Their menu is small so know anything you order has been perfected by heaven itself. I ordered the carnitas taco, which was great, but the winner was the beef taco. It melts in your mouth. The ceviche is also amazing. 

2) Efficiency: They are used to the popularity and have created a system to move people through fast while still maintaining good customer service. It's cash only, but that doesn't slow them down.

If you love Mexican, this place is the ONLY place to go in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is so f'ing good and it will def live up to the hype. I would travel 1.5 hrs from the GTA just to eat this and will not regret a second of spending time on the streetcar.

My personal favourite is the Octopus. It is so tender, juice, marinated to perfection and the perfect chewiness. The sauce in there will not disappoint you either.
Other personal favourites are the catch of the day (usually really good), carnitas and the baja fish. 

If you love spicy food, the spicy hot sauce is definitely one of the best I've tried. Just beware that it is really really really spicy and you don't put too much in your taco."}
{"text":"This place probably has the best tacos I've ever tasted in my whole entire life. The Gobernador (smoked tuna and shrimp) got me lost for words and I was just like MMMHHHH and MMMMMHHHH the entire time. You can really taste the 'smoke' of the tuna, though I feel it could be jussttt a little softer (the texture felt like somewhere between tuna and pork/chicken, but it doesn't really undermine the overall taste). The shrimps are perfectly crispy and seasoned. The green peppers, onions, and mayonnaise bring all the flavors together. The tortillas - I normally pay attention to the texture of the tortilla but I can't recall anything about it right now lol maybe cause the meats steal all the attention away. Probably the best food I had in Toronto and will definitely be back to try the other flavors the next time I visit the city."}
{"text":"Had their deep fried (I think it was baha) fish taco.  Very generous with the fish and toppings. Liked that they had various levels of spicy sauce for you to add on yourself.  Be prepared to get hands covered in delicious taco juice!"}
{"text":"This tiny place in Kensington Market will surprise you for on all fronts.  Food taste, quality, value, speed of service, repeat customers, rave reviews...on and on.

I've never seen this place not busy.  Often, they run out of food before the close and that's that!  Better luck next time.

The place is crammed, has only one table and a thin shelf around the storefront that acts as standing room only dining.  How does this place keep people coming back with such a hard to dine experience?  Read my first paragraph again!

The owner and brainchild of the place did live in California so this is the genuine Cali-Baja-Taco experience.  He also put together a medley of other protein servings too.  My fav is the Baja Fish but when they run out, it's a free for all as I'll take whatever they have - as they are all good!

Lucky for us, I found out that they are opening a larger restaurant with seating, maybe a bar, and more capacity to not only hold more people but more food - so they don't run out!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype. Best tacos I have had: period. OMG the line is huge. Though sun baked, we stood defying odds. And it was so worth it. Best fish tacos : gobernador, cameron diablo. Also the carnitas. Thr freshness and spice , aroma and texture are mind blowing. Bring cash as its cash only."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious tacos. Standing room only in this place, but get a taco to go, add your choice of salsa (or don't because they are delicious either way,) and enjoy a piece of heaven. The guacamole is also a must. Tacos were large so for me, one was more than enough."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Super friendly and the food's great! Those who get seats are super lucky... but even if you can't get a seat, the food still tastes amazing. Definitely earns it's 5 stars!"}
{"text":"So good!! The Baja Fish Taco was amazing and I also loved the Habanero hot sauce they had at the front. I put a little bit too much and as a result, shed a few tears from how spicy it was. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I found the tacos here to be quite overrated in light of all the positive comments that I have received about the place. The spot is small with limited seating and no washroom. 
I tried the mahi-mahi, carnitas, and gobernator tacos. The mahi-mahi was nice, but all three were overly salty and the smoke in the marlin (gobernator) was overwhelming. The tacos were filling at $4-5 a piece, but I would not call any of them one of the best tacos that I have eaten."}
{"text":"Delicious shrimp and fish tacos.  One of the best I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and very fresh. Each taco is pretty big (and a little more pricey than you'd expect), I had 2 and was full. Not much seats."}
{"text":"In a simple way, these are probably the best tacos in the whole city. Every single person who likes tacos and mexican food should come here. Prices are great, you eat two tacos for about $10.00 which is enough. You can eat more just because they are so good that you can't stop thinking about one more. 

The place is very small and most of the time you have to eat standing up. However if you manage to sit down in the only table they have, you will make new friends as usually the table is shared between 5 to 6 people and everyone ends up talking. Every time I go I meet someone there and every person I ever talked to there, says exactly the same: The tacos are unbelievably good! Go!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the fish&shrimp taco which was amazing. The pork taco was not good. I felt sick after eating it, the meat smelled weird and was dry. A bit pricey for one taco in my opinion but they're quite large so 1-2 was enough for me."}
{"text":"Amazing little place in Kensingon Market. There is usually a long line, so try to avoid peak meal times. Trust me, it's worth the wait!!! The spicy octopus taco is delicious (but don't go at the end of the day because they run out). There is not a lot of seating though, so eating your goodness packed taco standing up can get messy!"}
{"text":"Super busy, almost no seating, but WORTH IT for the Adobada pork taco! I was very surprised to find something i loved as i am not a seafood or fish person, and that is what this place is known for, but i will be coming back very shorty."}
{"text":"Just go and get the Gobernator. 

I just came back from Mexico and I can't say this is exactly what I had on the streets of Mexico City, but regardless I was pleasantly surprised! Lots of flavor and worth every penny! There is so much going on, I honestly couldn't tell I was eating tuna and shrimp, it really tasted like meat which I actually enjoyed. 

The one problem is that one taco won't fill you up, even though there is a lot piled on."}
