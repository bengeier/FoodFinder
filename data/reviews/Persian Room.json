{"text":"One of our favorites restaurants. Slightly higher priced than some restaurants but definitely worth it.  Portions are very generous and food is fantastically flavorful.  Nice ambiance too, think casual elegance.  The rice is the best anywhere around.  They also have some additional unusual varieties of rices for those who want to be adventurous. The multiple protein plate options on the menu give a nice variety.  The koobideh (spiced minced meat kabob) is so delicious here.  Something really nice is that you can get koobideh as a side order to an entree which is a great deal and allows you to try multiple things. If you have not been to the Persian room definitely make it a priority to experience this wonderful place!"}
{"text":"They are usually very friendly and the restaurant is a very nice environment. However, the last couple of times I went in, it was very busy and the service and food was not that great."}
{"text":"It can be a hit or a miss. For me, the first time I tried their food I did not like it at all, but I went again a couple of times and it has been absolutely delicious. FYI, the portions are HUGE!"}
{"text":"As close as it gets to my mama's cookin"}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch there on a Saturday and no lunch menu available..The food is bland especially the lamb which growing up in a Lebanese family I know how lamb is suppose to taste. The portions are huge but when the food is just so so who cares how much you get. The hummus is good and I ordered cucumbers with it. My wife is a chicken person and she said the taste was so so. I am glad we experienced the Persian room but we will not go back.."}
{"text":"As a young Persian far away from my mom's delightful creations, I can say this is one of the best Persian eateries I've been to to satisfy my cravings. The Kabobs are without a doubt on point. You'll never get the flavors you'd get eating kabob in Iran, but it is as close as one can get. I've had their beef-stews as well, which I enjoyed a lot. The flavors and contents to Stews are very unique by region, and I'm picky going off of my mom's cooking, but PR gives you pretty neutral stew dishes that could satisfy any Persian or non-Persian who has previously enjoyed home made Persian cuisine. I love the fact that they offer good tahdig, the warm bread, have different Doughs (drink), and also Persian ice cream... These are very important points that make this restaurant to be my favorite in the valley. My American husband loves it so much that he often offers to eat here ;)"}
{"text":"Pretty much the only place to get a decent Persian meal in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing atmosphere, and INCREDIBLE food! We are very picky with our middle eastern food and this place was the absolute best we've ever tasted. We would definitely recommend this to all of our friends. The chicken and the beef were both tender and delicious as well as the pita and the rice. We came to Scottsdale for 4 nights and we already went there on our first two nights and are definitely thinking about returning!"}
{"text":"The decor is really tacky but don't let that make you not want to try the Persian room.

I had the chicken kebabs and they were good. The best part of the meal though was the rice.

Servings are huge. I took the rest of mine to go and had lunch AND dinner the next day!"}
{"text":"You have to get their pistachio ice cream! I LOVE it. I've had it since I was a little kid and it's amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious!! :) got seats within five minutes of arriving. Service was top-notch and atmosphere was great!  Portions are huge, can definitely get one order for two people.

Not an ideal place for kids but perfect for dates, family gatherings, or any special occasion :)"}
{"text":"Coming from LA, I'm very picky with Persian food. Tried this place yesterday. The food was good. Our waitress was great. The place is nice and not too loud. The kashkebademjoon appetizer is out of this world. Whoever makes that, has gotten the recipe down irooni style."}
{"text":"Visited The Persian Room for our Special Anniversary and were pleasantly surprised.  We were greeted warmly and offered a very romantic table for two on the first level.

We started off with the Chicken Eggplant Barani and with the hot pita that was served made for a very satisfying appetizer.  Two Entrees we ordered were the Chicken & Koobideh Barg and the Gheimeh bademjan.  Both were very flavorful but the Barg was certainly by far much better.  We upgraded our rice to the Zereshk  as per the prior reviews and it was wonderful.

Overall we have a great time.  The next time we might just decide to order an appetizer and then share an entree since it truly is alot of food."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Scottsdale.  I've been coming here for over 4 years and love everything on the menu.  Having traveled to the UAE and loving the culture and food this is one place where the food is rich is taste and not in price.  I am regular with my Family and have never had an unpleasant experience. I luv the chicken shish and beef kabob and have to have the yogurt and cucumber (mast-o-khiar) with my dish. If there is ever a problem, I would definitely let them know and they would make it right. The managers are friendly, kind and always willing to help you decide on a dish. I can not say enough about the food other than if you enjoy fish, beef or chicken you are in the right place.  I live in N. Scottsdale and the service is always impeccable!!"}
{"text":"we took a weekend off, we live in tucson, got a nice hotel in phoenix and tried a couple of new to us restaurants.

this place is both eye-awesome and taste-amazing.
we watched them make the bread, walked around looking at the walls and listened to conversations in a half dozen languages...wow.

obviously a place for Iranians to eat.
genuine tastes, lots of food, mint on the table, a bit overwhelming.
waitress answered our questions with a hint of a smile, we tasted everything carefully, sniffed the air and loved everything.
thanks."}
{"text":"Great tasting Persian food. The quality of food is just great."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and it's always consistent in taste and service. The food is always delicious and the quantity is plenty. I highly recommend the yogurt with cucumber - mast o khiar - and the Persian room special (steak, chicken and koubideh)"}
{"text":"We were seated 45 mins after reservation...Food was good but not worth that kind of wait & aggravation. Service barely adeauate."}
{"text":"If you can get past the golden curtain rods, wall to wall marble and abundant chandeliers....hey no one said Persians were ever known for their decorating(!)...the food is delicious!  Very authentic - I want my koobideh with a raw onion and basil - and this is how it is served.  The food is what it is about and the food here delivers.  The bagoli pollo is by far my favorite and is closely comprable to my grandmothers - but of course, Aziz's is always the best. :)  Seriously go - and if you have never had Persian food - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Will not be going back ! I booked a reservation for my engagement and it was all bad experience for me ! Baddddd service , they were so rude  ! I spend so much money for cold food and dry rice . I did a package and it was all different when I got there . I don't recommend for anyone to do a reservation at Persian room ."}
{"text":"Great food. Staff was friendly and helpful. The food is authentic. As Persian food goes, it's very good and the quality is excellent. Some folks complain about speed but we didn't experience anything out of the ordinary. Persian food just takes a bit and they do a great job with the presentation. Portions are huge which is kind of an Iranian thing. Nice place with great atmosphere. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. But the service was poor.  Waiting time for food was longer then expected for a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"If you want to go to a place that serves you more delicious food than you can possibly eat, try the Persian Room. It's the best I've ever had!

{"text":"The kubideh platter was amazing. The meat was tender and juicy. Service was great and they were really friendly. Dish was $15 but so worth it. Would come again!"}
{"text":"The best kabob (koobideh) in AZ.  We always get either the beef koobideh or chicken koobideh with rice and greek salad.  This dish is fantastic.  We go here several times a month.  The best beverage is the homemade doogh (flat, no soda).  They start you off with bread and butter and a side of cilantro or basil leaves and onion.  Very good restaurant."}
{"text":"We used to frequent this restaurant every year for Christmas as it was one of few open. Unfortunately, due to their racist policies, we will never return. It was understandably packed so I understand not being able to be seated, but the manager told us we wouldn't be able to order takeout... even though 3 of the meals were being brought to the VA hospital for Marines. The reason was because 'we have 3000 Persians in town to serve'. I couldn't believe he actually said that. Never returning and neither should anyone else who is against racism."}
{"text":"Sultani was amazing .. We came here Saturday night for dinner and food was amazing , but it was super busy and quite abit of wait but well worth it ."}
{"text":"Yum, yum in my tum!
Very cool to find authentic and yummy Iranian food in Arizona. My family noshed on it enjoyably.
Rich black tea, chewy homemade pita served with fresh basil, onions and butter. The butter was kind of odd--a concession to Americans?-- Usually you find feta.

Anyway the zhresck pulo (rice with saffron and sour barberries) was tangy and sweet, tasty witht the chicken kubideh kabob (zesty herby ground chicken kabob). We also had the beef kubideh,and classic chicken and beef kabobs, served with buttery basmati rice.

Also good was the Kashk Bademjan appetizer, a savory dip made with roasted eggplant, garlic, mint and yogurt whey, (really it's creamy and good) tasty with the pita.

Better than Reza in Chicago, equal to other persian food I've had, but great to find authentic ethnic food in glitzy Scottsdale.

There was a group of women near us, and they let their young kids play and wander around  near their table as they chit-chatted--a slight nuisance, but nothing too detracting. Service was slowish but attentive, but the place was packed. Enjoyable nonetheless."}
{"text":"The Persian room was a very nostalgic dining experience, starting from the ambiance, setting, and music. The food was exceptional, being familiar with Persian cuisine and trying flavors from Iran to many Iranian restaurants this place has great traditional flavors, great taste and authenticity. We tried the tadigh with both stews, both being really good. For entree we had lamb shank, koobideh, chicken kabob which all were pretty tender, lots of flavor and delicious. However the bakhlava was a bit on the sweeter side. Overall it was a great dining experience. Nice setting, Fantastic food, fair pricing."}
{"text":"I am very big fan of Persian Food, and love the food at Persian Room. Have been here several times and enjoyed the food every time. Lamb Shanks is our favorite. 
Although their food is great, their service is less than average, each time. More recently, I tried to redeem my groupon worth of $40. The waitress, Ludima, deducted just $4 from the bill instead of $40 and I almost overlooked it. Upon notification, they gave refund of $36 and with such an insincere apology backed up by the statement \"No body is perfect\". Dissatisfied by such rude behavior. Their less than average service is the primary reason for my rating."}
{"text":"The best. I mean yummy Persian food. I truly miss it. My folks loved it too. I hope to be back again when I am in town. My husband used to take me here for a romantic dinner date. The food was divine."}
{"text":"Super oily food that will give you a heart attack! Staff have a bad attitude and are very rude."}
{"text":"Good service and very good food.  We had a combination plate, a stew, and an app and it fed four adults perfectly.  The rice could use more flavor."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  We were in the area on vacation for 3 weeks and came here 4 times, it was that good!  First, I want to address the bread that other reviewers have mentioned.  They do use pita bread at lunch, but after 5 pm, they serve the authentic Persian bread - made hot and fresh!
The bread is served with fresh herbs and onion - so tasty together.  
At my visits, I tried a few different things, including koobideh, beef barg (filet mignon kebab), loobia polo and koobideh.  I was never disappointed.  The koobideh was flavorful and delicious, the barg was so tender it melted in your mouth.  Your dinner comes with a HUGE side of basmati rice  - so delicious!  I did substitute different rice sides a couple times - once with the albaloo polo (sour cherries in the rice) if you've never had it, you've got to try it - it was awesome! One night I substituted the baghala polo (dill weed and fava beans) - also delicious!  
Bottom line is - food is amazing, huge servings, service was always pleasant an quick - my favorite restaurant in the area!!"}
{"text":"Treated some dear friends to dinner at The Persian Room last evening m(their first time, but certainly not for my family and me). Of course we asked for our favorite server - Lucy - and like all previous times, she truly delivered. As always, excellent service and attentiveness without any intrusion to our meal. While the food is consistently GREAT, Lucy always makes the entire dining experience EXCELLENT for us. Thank you so very much Lucy - you sure know how to treat all your guests to the best time possible while dining at your restaurant and we will always look forward to seeing you again and again !!!"}
{"text":"Kaybob was excellent.  Server friendly.  Always a great experience.   And my wife's side of the family is Persian!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant for all people who want to taste the best and original Persian food. Persian Room is the best of the best restaurants in Arizona. I went to that restaurant many times. Persian Room has everything that makes it an authentic restaurant. They have best Kebab ever, but they call it \"Kobbideh\". Kobbideh was served well done and with white rice !!"}
{"text":"Service was great and server was informative. The bread is amazing. 

Portions are huge and the filet and chicken dish with the basmati rice was fantastic. 

We had a party of four and everyone loved their dish. 

Very surprising interior based on the exterior. 

I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome place and food!!! When we arrived to restaurant and stepped out of the car, we saw many fancy cars parked by the place and that gave us a very good impression of the restaurant before we entered it. When we entered the restaurant, we were warmly welcomed and seated, and every staff member went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. Despite the luxurious decorations and classy furniture in the restaurant, the atmosphere of the establishment was easygoing and heartfelt. The whole place was clean and all the waiters and waitresses were very accommodating. Once we were seated, a plate of vegetables consisting of mint, onion, butter, flatbread and cups of water were placed for us. After that, the waitress who was serving us gave us the menu and some recommendations for what to order. 
We started with appetizers of hummus and yogurt. The hummus was made of mashed chickpeas blended with tahini, olive oil, garlic, lemon juice. The yogurt dip was flavored with garlic and topped with raisins. We ate both of them with their bottomless homemade flatbread that was fresh and served. We had to be careful not to eat too much of the appetizers because we wanted to save room for the main entrée, but we could not get enough. 
After that we moved to the main dishes that took decent time to prepare. We had chicken shish, which was a plate of thick chunks of boneless chicken breast marinated in a special sauce and skewered with bell peppers, onions and tomatoes. It was served with basmati rice. The other dish that we had was lamb shish kebab, which was basically a plate of thick chunks of marinated and seasoned lamb loin skewered with peppers, onions and tomatoes. This dish was also served with basmati rice. I liked the chicken more, it was tender and juicy, while the lamb was a little bit hard to chew."}
{"text":"great food - chicken, rice, bread..
very large portions
priced just rite
decor is gaudy, but its okay good food made up for it.

YUM YUM YUM"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The meat was so juicy and succulent. Every bite was a flavour explosion in your mouth.. A must try for someone interested in having an experience with flavorful food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The hummus is delicious and their chicken never lacks in flavor. The staff might not be the greatest and that's the only reason I'm giving 4 stars rather than 5, but the food definitely makes up for it. I have always recommended this to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"The interior design is pure awesomeness. Fancy curtains, old-school stairs, huge (wood if I remember) tables and chairs. The bathrooms were also very nice. If a place looks this good the food quality doesn't matter as much, but the food didn't disappoint either. It's not cheap (very well worth their prices though). I promise that you won't be hungry by the time you leave the door. As others mentioned, their portions are HUGE! I tried some type of Fish which came with rice, salads and more, and loved it. 
Service was also great. I appreciate the waitresses not bugging us every 2 minutes. Definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food . The lamb loin with saffron rice, dates and lentils were delicious. We also had hummus and eggplant appetizers. You will enjoy this restaurant.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. 
Their complimentary bread, butter and basil is just fantastic.
I usually get Chicken Filet Sultani which is probably the best in their menu."}
{"text":"Persian room definitely doesn't disappoint.  I have been to this restaurant quite a few times and I always leave full with a takeout box."}
{"text":"Definitely very surprised at this place! Loved their food, very tasty and filling. Their meat is juicy, moist and flavorful. We ordered several of the big plates to share and it was well worth it. Their rice tasted delicious. Also ordered the hummus and eggplant dip which was very tasty. Only downside was their flat bread was bland even with the butter. The butter was bland too. It's also pricey so all those I deducted a star. I'll be back when I'm in town though!"}
{"text":"Food was great, but HORRIBLE service!
Walked in the door, I wasn't even acknowledged for the first 5 minutes. Hostess was on the phone. Didn't even say \"hi\" or \"be with you in a minute\" I just stood there until 1 of the waiters finally sat me down.  I'm not gonna get into details. Just work on your service."}
{"text":"The food is so very delicious and gets a Five Star rating, for that alone. The service is so so, but you'll be able to look past it once their fillet mignon melts in your mouth. 

I recommend the koobideh beef especially. It just seems to dissolve into amazingness in your mouth. And for dessert, try the Persian ice cream. Yum. 

A combination platter will feed four easy, though the menu says it's for two. My husband and I had so much left over that it served as a lunch and dinner the next day. 

One more tip, don't be shy to try the free appetizer. The bread is made fresh in a tandoori-like oven. Spread some butter on it, add lots of basil leaves and some onion and enjoy."}
{"text":"Delicious food! We started with the Kash O'bademjan which is an eggplant dip and it was very good and a big size. I ordered the Zereshk polo and it was so good as well as the beef koobideh. It was very flavorful."}
{"text":"If you live in Scottsdale, or travel there for work or golf, you owe it to yourself to spend an evening at the Persian Room. It's the culinary equivalent of a warm, loving hug from an exotic brunette.

I was seated with a lovely Persian who walked me through the finer points of the menu. I can't guarantee this will be your experience, since I brought this particular guide with me, but she confirmed that the dishes were authentic and well prepared.

We enjoyed signature items like the savory carbonated yogurt, delicious crispy rice, and heavenly filet mignon skewers. The portions were ginormous, and the flavors rich and clean. We nearly cried when leaving behind as much food as we did, but we couldn't fit the platters in our carryon luggage.

We were placed near a soothing water element in the two level restaurant, which I've heard is decorated elegantly and subtly. I didn't notice because I was entranced by my dinner companion."}
{"text":"If you planning to go on a busy day then I would recommend you to reserve seats before.We tried combo platter lamb shish & chicken,Rice is so good and especially baklava is a must try if you haven't tried before .cheers"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places around! 

We went the first time on a saturday at 7pm and it was very crowded and service was average.

We came back in a week day for lunch and it was amazing! The food is tasty and proportions are good.
I love the bread they make there. It's freshly baked and comes out hot and ready to eat!
Grilled ground beef (they have lamb and beef ) is nicely cooked with spiceS.
You can upgrade the rice you order as they have a variety of rice types (with dates or raisins....)"}
{"text":"The service was absolutely terrible I've never waited so long for food at any restaurant. The water was not refilled on a timely basis and also there were dirty tables right behind us with no one attending to them."}
{"text":"This place is bomb!  The fresh bread they start you out with served with basil, cilantro and a whole onion was simple and my favorite.  Best Mahi Mahi I've ever eaten.  Dolmas were perfect.  Just all around impressed.   luxurious atmosphere with good service.  So good!"}
{"text":"Love this place! 
Someone comes in from out of town - I take them to the Persian Room. 
It's your birthday? Let's go to the Persian Room
Graduation - Holiday party - bad day... you get the idea.

People think you have to dress up, but I've seen it all from fancy dresses to laid back shorts (I'm in the shorts!)

I suggest the chicken filet kabob, hummus with the pita bread - just my opinion."}
{"text":"Recently had dinner at the Persian Room.  The loin spring lamb was not good, neither was the ground lamb.  I've definitely have better. The Greek salad was served with a yogurt dressing.  Why?  The rice is very bland and the add on skewer of Mahi, Mahi was nearly the price of a meal full meal, one skewer was $15.  I've given it two stars for the hot Naan bread.  We are not Persian so we were seated under the stairwell facing a pillar!  If you are a meat eater, go to Fogo's Brazilian Steak House.  The tender lamb chops, fillet, prime rib and garlic steak is excellent and their warm cheese bread and polenta sticks are extraordinary. The salad bar is fantastic!"}
{"text":"My husband surprised with reservations at the Persian Room.  WOW!  Such a treasure  in a suburban setting.  Incredible portions and the food was delicious.  There is a market next door that is magical baking fresh pita in a brick oven.  
Pleasant surrounding , attentive service and authentic food.  YUM!"}
{"text":"the koobidehs are the best.  only thing worth getting there.  service is great for the most part.  one tall persian guy there with bad service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really good.  The food is awesome and service is really good. You have to get their lamb, humus, and their different rice."}
{"text":"Group of friends threw me a birthday party here.  I had a pretty satifying experience. The food was the typical Persian food that you find in the US. Not authentic but close enough. I can't compare it to the Persian food that I've eaten in Tehran but it was pretty good. I tried the skewered lamb though I'm not sure what it was named on the menu - probably the Soltani something I think. The staff was friendly, we all had fun and I'd probably come here again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Persian restaurant in the valley.  I always come to eat whenever I visit the area.  The food is exceptionally delicious.  Has a variety of choices.  It is  spacious in size and well decorated.  Reasonable price. Friendly staff. My favorite dish is Kebab Sultani. Very tender beef. If you come for lunch. Choose from lunch menu. Much cheaper and approximately same size portion. Plenty of car parking"}
{"text":"Inconsistent. ---On one visit for dinner, I was wowed by ghormeh sabzi (sauteed chunks of beef, parsley, chives, cilantro and methi leaves simmered in a special sauce with kidney beans and dried limes). On a return visit, I tried the ghormeh sabzi, and was a bit disappointed. The dinner version had seemed perfect --with tasty meat throughout --but the lunch version had an excess of watery gravy and just two pieces of meat). 

I had tah dig (crispy and crunchy crust of rice) at dinner with ghormeh sabzi and it didn't seem as tasty as that made by Persian friends.

I tried gheimeh bademjan (sauteed chunks of beef with yellow split peas, onions and dried limes simmered in fresh tomato sauce, topped with sauteed eggplant), at lunch, and was disappointed to find just two pieces of (very tasty) meat. 

Per my lackluster experience with the lunch versions, I would order dinner versions no matter the time of day, and/or have a discussion with the wait staff about what to expect (maybe the pot of stew was towards the end, and the meat just happened to have run low that day, who knows?) 

The fessenjan (sauteed chicken and ground walnuts simmered in  pomegranate sauce is not as good as elsewhere (friend's, or my own). I did try it at dinner.

Before each meal, diners are served very tasty hot bread, butter, raw onions, and basil.

Torshi, a traditional offering of marinated vegetables is probably an acquired taste (I didn't care for it). The waiter cautioned me against ordering the homemade yogurt drink (yogurt, soda water, salt and mint), but I ordered it and enjoyed it (it was enough for two people it was so big --but my companion didn't like it). --I like yogurt drinks (e.g., lassi), though.

I have heard the hummus is good here and plan to try it.

At my most recent visit, we had several pieces of dirty silverware.

Wait staff was attentive and efficient.

Environment is quite relaxing, with fountains, lovely lighting and windows."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for a long time and glad I finally made it! If you haven't been here yet and wanted to try some good Persian food, this is a place for you, BUT, come hungry, the plates are huge, one dish for one is meant to share for two.

This place has really high-end interior, with a fancy stair to the 2nd floor. You can call it classy, or I don't know, they are trying...

Food was delicious! Eggplant hummus started very well for us, we could taste only a hint of eggplant, but good enough! Two of us also shared a plate of lamb and chicken with rice, both meat were nicely marinated, yet flavorful, and so tender! And the rice was very fluffy. Maybe we had too much hummus and pita, even with just one order of entree, we still had leftover. Again, portion here is big!!!

Will definitely come back for me, but will always come with friends!"}
{"text":"I love food and people who know me can confirm that. But what I like is really great food when it comes to Persian dishes. I have been to Persian Room about a 20 times in past 10 years. I used to go to it when it was a hole in the wall with a different name (forgot the old name). I now compare all the Persian restaurants to this one. Their food is even better than most Persian restaurants in Iran. As I recall the owner was very picky about his dish and would not allow you to order your food rare or well done. He cooked it the way it was intended to be cooked. They have great decor (and building), wonderful service and awesome food. I have tried most everything on their menu and I don't know of anything that I didn't love. Every Persian restaurant should be measured against Persian Room. 

I moved to Seattle several years ago, but every time I go to Scottsdale, I make sure to visit Persian Room. My sweet sweet Persian Room. I wish you were closer. Hey (Persian Room owner dude), why don't you come to Seattle and open a restaurant. Your only competition will be Caspian Grill, but you can get way ahead of them if you have a nice decor and bring all your great foods and keep the prices the same as in Scottsdale. Open a place in Newcastle, WA. Pleeeeease (with sugar all over it). 

Well, that should explain how much I like Persian Room"}
{"text":"Love the Persian Room. Excellent appetizers and they make their pita fresh in the dining room.  The fresh basil, butter and onion they serve with their pita is delicious. Great service!"}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner. We had a 6:30 Rez for 9 people. When we checked in they told us they were not taking reservations for Christmas. I made my reservation 3 weeks ago on opentable. This is the third year we have done this. Hostess said to show them my reservation and when I checked my opentable account it was gone. Then I saw email from 11:30am stating restaurant cancelled the reservation. It was an hour minimum wait and I was with 2 diabetic s in our group. No apology or anything. Could not believe a place would do that on Christmas to a big group or any group for that matter. Lucky we found somewhere else that took us in and was very accommodating unlike the Persian room. It's to bad as we have been coming since it was a tiny place in West Phoenix, then another location in Scottsdale and finally this location. Liked it better when they were appreciative of the business."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place.. Best hummus in the world. 

The service can be hit or miss, but as soon as you start eating you forget about it.. Yes, it's that good!"}

{"text":"Food is tasteless, very bland. Server tries hard to rip you off, Charged me for an extra meal i didn't even order!!!! Then after mentioning this, i get no apologies but another additional charge onto my regular order. This place is unethical,avoid old blonde waitress at all costs !!!! Very unprofessional and lack business ethics. Horrible service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Persian food here! 

Paulina, our food runner, was excellent as well! Very friendly and a treat to engage with!"}
{"text":"This place has really taken a turn in the worst direction. As a family  we used to enjoy coming here for the ambiance customer service and great food. I went here last night and had to wait for 2 hours to get a table. This was after the hostess quoted us 40 minutes of wait time. there was no server where we were seated on the 2nd floor and it took another 20 minutes just to get water, we had to call over another server from a different section just to take our order. Once the food arrived at our table we needed more water and there was no server around so I had to get up go to the bar and fill up the cup myself before going back to the table. When broughten to the managers attention, the manager blamed it on the newer server who is also managing the bar is that he's just not experienced enough right now. The problem in this situation is with him the manager because he needs to do a better job of managing the restaurant. I do not see myself ever coming back here and I encourage other people who value their time and money to not support them either"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here.  I've driven by it for years, and finally was invited to go with some friends.  We were seated right away and given a bread, onion, and basil (I think) dish.  There were four of us, and we ordered two of the specials for two people.  There was so much food, and it was amazing.  HUGE portions of rice though.  I recommend saying that you don't want one each.  The meat was prepared perfectly, and the dishes were great.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"One of favorite places to go! Ambiance is nice and the food is delicious. Try a combination platter! Best Baklava too!"}
{"text":"This is my wife's favorite place to eat in Scottsdale.  She loves the rice.  How do they get it so fluffy?  I really like the filet and the gyro."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the decor & food at the Persian Room. lots to take home.

Already 10 minutes passed ...Now when I asked how much we have to wait they said couple of minutes as The Manager is personally looking into it .... Unfortunately we waited for 20 more minutes and guess what they were asking us to wait further if we need to get the pitta bread... Huh !! What a waste of time ..."}

{"text":"We have had persian food all over.  Living in Arizona this is our go to place for great persian food.  Make sure to get either the sultani or koobideh plate. Generous portions, excellent flavor and well priced.  Other things to try: tahdig with two stews, mast mouser, kashk bademjan.  very good food."}
{"text":"The best Persian food I have had in the country.  A fabulous gem right here in The Valley rivaling top Persian restaurants in NY, LA, Chicago.  Lucky to have them here.  Management is absolutely committed to quality food and a quality experience."}
{"text":"This place has the best Persian food.  Get the combination platters so you do not miss out on all the amazing food and flavors.  To top it off a fantastic staff who is very nice and wants to make sure your experience is amazing."}
{"text":"Usually great service. The only thing I will order is the chicken barg with the rice that has dates and lentils in it, but that's only because  I love that dish so much. 

The hummus is great. The only downside is the fresh pita is only made after 5 sometimes after 530, otherwise the pita is not as good. 

 Nice, calm atmosphere. Not the type of place to go if you're looking for a fun dinner. Perfect for families or small gatherings that want to enjoy a conversation over a meal."}
{"text":"I won't be back. Their grilled lamb was served to me cold. We tipped the kid that was our waiter out of pity."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour! We got free hummus at the bar too. Great deal and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Wow, my boyfriend brought me here for Valentine's Day. It is very unique and the food is really good.  Homemade fresh bread with cilantro , basil and onion. I thought that was the weirdest thing ever but it was so good!!!  Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Holy moly this place is good. The server started us out with a pita basil and onion appetizer. We ordered dolmeh, (perfection), hummus (divine) and we split one of their combo platters of filet,  chicken and tibbeh with a rice dish and cucumber salad. Everything was fantastic and the server was very informative and helpful. 

We finished with the baklava and the homemade ice cream. The baklava was the best I've ever had. The ice cream was the only thing I tried that I didn't like. It was pistachio and rose water. Just not my thing. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the best persian food I have come across here in Phoenix so far. Anything you order will not disappoint. My favorites are the Koobideh, eggplant hummus, and I love the rice. There are different kinds of rice you can get just the plain bazmati,  Zereshk which adds barberries and another one I like is Baghala which adds fava beans and dill. It is a bit of a drive for me but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Went last night for Valentine's dinner, and was seriously disappointed. I've been a frequent customer over the years, and never once experienced such a mess. People who'd made reservations were waiting with the walk-in guests. Which... What is the point of making a reservation if my table has not been reserved for my party? That was strike one. After 30+ minutes of waiting, we were escorted to our table upstairs. And that was a mess in itself. The bar was completely packed, people literally had no room to stand/sit. After a significant amount of time waiting for a waiter to arrive, he finally came. Ordering was easy, and the food came quick (surprisingly). But our requests for water and bread were so delayed. I had to stop midway through my meal because I needed a refill and the waiter wasn't around to know that for a solid 10 minutes. Downstairs was absolute chaos, with the poor waiters having to weave through a group of 40+ people in that lobby area. All in all, I'm pissed about the experience, and my family and I agreed we're done with this restaurant after going there for years. For the amount of money they rake in per party, I expect a hell of a lot better."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good Middle Eastern place and this fit the bill.  Hummus was awesome and kabob was really good. Lots of food, enough to share dishes and try out new things. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Been visiting the restaurant for the last few years everytime we go to the area. The food has improved the last couple of times we been there.
At one point we decide not to go there any more because the food was not the best for the price and the enviroment that they were trying to present.
They have improved the quality of their food and we will be going there next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in town.  The food is authentically prepared, they have generous portions and the restaurant is big and comfortable.  I go there often and always like the food.  Try the hummus and chicken kabobs !"}
{"text":"We've lived here for over 5 years and literally down the street, but this was our first trip to the Persian Room.  We made reservations, because it was our anniversary, and were seated promptly.  Our server Nicole took our order and we were off to the races.  We ordered the hummus, shirazi salad and the shish kebab combination.  Everything was excellent.  For desert, Nicole brought out the delicious rosewater infused pistachio ice cream to say Happy Anniversary!  Prices are very fair and the portions are large.  

We were very happy to have chosen the Persian Room to celebrate our 23rd wedding anniversaary."}
{"text":"I live in LA but make sure to stop by Persian Room whenever Im in Phoenix area. I feel like the quality has degraded over the past few years. I never forget how their kabob tasted like the first time I tried them, they literally melted in my mouth but today, i tried their Soltani but the kabobs tasted like average kabob places in LA."}
{"text":"Got the Persian Room special for four! LOVED IT. Fresh everything, bread, meat, rice. The Eggplant humus dip is a must try for starter, and deff try the fresh leaves they give you with the raw onion. I loved breaking the leaves off and eating it with the humus dip. Really authentic and family oriented. Fresh homemade food!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. .. we always come here for special occasions.  The humus is very good,  along w the large platter of filet chicken, beef filet and koobideh with rice. We've been here many times and the food is very consistent!  Love it!  Reason for 4 stars is I find the wait staff not as friendly & courteous."}
{"text":"The dinner plates are huge. Very. Big. Portions. Ask your server for recommendations on both food and wine, very knowledgeable. Happy hour only valid in the upstairs bar, not on ground level dining room."}
{"text":"MENU PLATE #18 is perfect if your not into middle eastern food too much but want good quality rice chicken and kabob"}
{"text":"A Comment from an oregonian: Very delicious food, I tried chicken fillet sultani, and it was awesome. My wife ate tahdig with fesenjoon and ghormeh sabzi, that was awesome too."}
{"text":"ok if arizona had more of this business we would be at the place every day we love it .... great food you must try or dont and eat food that is the day to day average..

  i know that this will be around forever i hope i have to travel 45 min to get to the location... 
\"\"\"\" good food."}
{"text":"Went there last week for the second time.  I felt i should give them a second try before I give them a bad review.  Luckily, the experience was much better the second time.  The food is tasty and some items are very large portions.  The big problems are with the staff.  Make sure you grab and hold your server to make sure you have their attention or there will be mistakes with your order.  The soup/osh (sp?) is ok but very small portion for the price.  I got the combination kebabs which was chicken, ground beef and filet and it was perfectly served over basmati long grain rice and grilled roma tomato. My friend was encouraged to order a dinner salad with her \"Persian pasta\".  She thought it was very bland.  But what surprise us was that when the pasta arrived, there was a side of salad with it.  This trip, the server was very prompt which was a 180 degree from our last visit.  But couldn't help being troubled by his hipster attempts and over the top familiarity which included winking at me or giving me thumbs up as he is walking away to put our order in.  I would not consider this to be a Fine dining establishment but the food is tasty so I recommend it.  Depending on what you get and portion sizes, priced can be considered a bargain or too high so ask to make sure you choose correctly.  We both liked our meals flavor and had we gotten better service, I would have given the place 5 stars which is huge considering the horrible experience I had the first time."}
{"text":"My bad review is a result of the service I received. After searching and searching for the perfect spot to eat in North Scottsdale, my friend and I decided to try out the Persian Room based on reviews and word of mouth; we specifically filtered it to find a place that was \"good for kids\" as we both had young infants that we were bringing and we made sure to bring them before the dinner crowd incase one of them got fussy. While we were ordering, our waitress proceeded to pull the menu from my 7mo old because she didn't want her playing with it stating \"don't chew on that\" ( and she shouldn't have been, it was dirty... Regardless, that was MY job as a mother to notice and remove it from my infant) with such attitude and when my baby proceeded to get upset, as any 7month old would if a stranger yanked something from their hands, she stated \"OMG what a good little girl\" with such sarcasm that I was literally speechless. This was extremely offensive and it fits right into the stereotype that is snooty scottsdale. Our night was ruined and we made sure to leave ASAP.

We will NEVER be returning, with or without our children."}
{"text":"We love the Persian Room for special dinners, birthdays, valentines day, etc.  it does not disappoint and we have been eating here for at least 8 years.  The food is awesome both in portion size and quality.  Most recently, our chicken was so moist and flavorful that it was the star of the meal.  The freshly baked pita is always wonderful but the real accolades should be given to the special rice.  The barberry rice is splendid, the cherry rice exotic and flavorful, the dill and bean rice very light and delicious.

I am gluten free and most things on the menu can work for me.

The only reservation I have and wish I could have awarded four and one half stars was that our waitress was a little too intrusive.  We know she was striving to be friendly and do her job well, but she was just a little too chatty and we we would have preferred it if she left us to ourselves a bit more.  This is an anomaly, in our experience, however, and may be due to the fact that we were early diners and she had nowhere else to focus her energies.

The dining room is very beautiful, don't miss the ceiling and the fountain.  We have never been upstairs but that is probably very luxurious as well.  

Prices are very good and value for money on portion size.  We always take home enough for at least one additional meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! The chicken, steak, and rice is so delicious that we have made this place a tradition for my birthday! However, service is always somewhat cold and aloof here and we had to ask many questions our first time since we weren't sure about the flat bread and onions. Now that we know what we like we don't let the servers get us down. I would suggest making reservations but even then you'll have to wait because they're a little disorganized."}
{"text":"Had the filet kabob and it was delicious. The bread is amazing too. My daughter loves the fountain.  Nice ambiance"}
{"text":"The ambience was good, upstairs bar is a very different feel than the main area downstairs...great place to be a little more casual and watch a game, etc

First thing to know: the portions are very big! That's not a bad thing, but don't be surprised when they bring your plates!

The hummus and eggplant appetizer was very good, with the bread. The Koobideh and Chicken Shish were great entrées!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, yummy food and friendly staffs. My first time at this place, have gone to many Persian restaurants before in NYC. This place is very different ,very good. We were at phenix for a week, went to Persian room twice."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous!  My wife and I ordered a combination platter so that we could sample different menu offerings.  Included were barg (fillet mignon), chicken fillet, and koobideh (ground lamb roasted) served with basmati rice and grilled tomato.  The menu stated that it was for 2, but the platter, really a large tray, was enough for 3 or 4.  We ordered a side of cucumber yogurt which was perfect with the main course.  It came with tiny currents and finely chopped pistachio sprinkled on top--absolutely delicious as a dip for the warm pita bread and meats.  We also recommend dolmens, stuffed grape leaves, as an appetizer .
We were seated right away, waitress was friendly, food came out hot and well presented."}
{"text":"My brother and I did an epic roadtrip across North America from San Francisco, CA to Washington D.C. and we were on a quest to try chelokabob everywhere along the way. Our first lunch stop was in Pheonix, AZ and my research led me to the Persian Room.

The ambiance was reminiscent of some of the best chelokabob houses I've been to, with opulence leading you into their perfectly lit dining area. With the fountain outside and the beautiful glasswork and staircase inside you would expect the prices of the food to be high as well but things were very reasonably priced. Being the first chelokabobi on our trip, we wanted to do things right but not overload ourselves so we ended up getting lunch plates.

Before our main courses were served we were given complimentary sabzi and noon (bread and herbs), which may seem trivial but being that chelokabob is basically rice and kabob, having some herbs to start off with is a necessity. Lunch was served and HOLY COW the lunch plates were gigantic. Imagine the same portion for a generous helping of chelo and kabob, but half of the rice was replaced with house salad. My ONLY gripe was that the dressing was put on the salad in the kitchen instead of leaving the dressing on the side. I can't complain really since I could just as easily had read the description on their lunch plates and said dressing on the side.

The chelo was executed wonderfully with it being not too mushy or slippery nor too dry. The salad and sabzi were incredibly fresh and flavorful. The kabob I must say made me worry..... I was worried that we had gone to such a GREAT kabob house that everywhere else would pale in comparison and the rest of our epic journey would suck. The kabob was executed FANTASTICALLY and left us in awe that such tastes welcomed us into Phoenix. If I ever visit Phoenix again I will be sure to visit the Persian room again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, portions are large so if you aren't a big eater you might want to share."}
{"text":"Food was just okay. They serve dinner on serving platters which is way too much food. Waiter was obnoxious and became extremely annoying as the evening went on. Felt like he was rushing us and just wanted us to pay the bill and leave. Not sure we will go back."}
{"text":"Ordered at 10 am for a 5 pm pick up... I showed up at 5:15 thinking I was late and feeling bad, just to find out the hadn't even started making my order yet... Had to wait 35 minutes. 

It's unfortunate because their food is good but the service not so much.. There is a reason people call in advance so that they DON'T have to wait."}
{"text":"Upon arriving on a Sunday the parking lot was packed with several people walking in and out of the place. After checking in with the hostess, we were promptly seated. Due to the number of people coming in they were short menus initially and apologized for the inconvenience. 

We were promptly served some water and bread. The bread came with butter basil, cilantro, and onion. The waiter explained the various things that you could do and how to mix and eat the items. 

After taking our tables orders, various restaurant staff helped us through the night and were very attentive with refills for drinks and providing more bread. The food arrived in a timely manner considering how busy the place was."}
{"text":"Nice food. We went there for the Persian new year and I ordered lamb shank which was super tender and tasty. Koobideh also seemed to be awesome. The dish is too big (even) for me to finish, and almost everyone of us brought something back in box."}
{"text":"Crowded for lunch, and that was good to see.  Free appetizers of fresh pita bread, white sweet onion, and basil and cilantro and butter is incredible. I had Beef Gyros, and my wife ordered Koobidah, which was very tasty. Service was good, ambiance good, and I look forward to going for dinner in the very near future."}
{"text":"The food is always great, but the service isn't great. We had a waitress today, Ludmila, who was scolding us like we were children because we didn't tell her to separate our checks in the beginning. Then we tried to make it easier for her and wrote down exactly what each person had and then she told us we made it \"more difficult\" for her. Then she went around and did exactly what we had done. I get that it might be annoying, but she didn't have to be rude."}
{"text":"The food is stellar, a great place to go if you enjoy authentic Middle Eastern cuisine. The service has been bad on more than one occasion. It often takes much longer than it should for servers to bring bread and drinks to the table, and food comes out sporadically. By the time you finish waiting for the rest of your party to get their food, yours is cold."}
{"text":"The waiting time is ridiculous long for everything during lunch time,  we even needed to wait for 45 minutes for the food, 10 minutes for a to go box, then another 10 mins for the plastic bag, another 20 minutes for the check, etc....and the restaurant is not even half full...

I was not even talking about other stuff the waitress screwed it up."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of middle eastern and this restaurant tops the list. I have been here 4 or 5 times and it's consistently good.   Beautiful ambiance with a big chandelier at the entrance.  there's a small area up the winding staircase with a bar and tables  that are a little more intimate, and the main floor has both booths and separate tables.  dress up or casual.  Everything is very very fresh and the service is good.  big plates of fresh basil with every meal and wonderful fresh baked pita bread.  My favorite is the fava beans with rice... yummm!  The rose water ice cream was crazy good!"}
{"text":"This is a very fancy restaurant with prices that are about $20 per main course. overwhelming good service and waiters and waitresses have good tastes. I would go here again."}
{"text":"Had the lamb shish kabab.  It was fair.  Not seasoned very well and the lamb was marinated too long, poor texture. The cherry rice was good and the service excellent."}
{"text":"Best kabobs I've had (other than my mom's)!  This includes Persian restaurants in London, NYC, SF, Dallas, and Houston.  I was blown away.  We had beef koobideh and lamb kabobs.  I wish I lived in Scottsdale just to eat here regularly.  Great service and food.  I would recommend to Persians and non-Persians alike."}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Mediterranean Restaurants in Arizona, aside from other states and overseas. The Persian Room is, by far, one of the best in Arizona, if not The Best. You will find a mixed crowd there and it is as casual as you want it to be. From large parties celebrating an occasion, business meetings, families, couples and friends, everyone is welcome. Now back to the food...I have had several dishes including the Chicken Filet Sultani, Barg, Sultani, Naderi, and Gyros, and all were wonderful. All seasoned well and very tender. To start off, the Tah Dig (crispy rice) topped with Gheimeh stew is delicious. You can have that alone as a meal, but most parties start with this as an appetizer, along with Shirazi Salad. Most meals are served with Basmati Rice and you can choose Shirazi Salad to accompany it. If you go after 5pm, you will have the opportunity to try their freshly baked pita bread, as well. My absolute favorite entree is the Koobideh (seasoned ground beef and minced onions). It is the best I have ever had. Just be forewarned, the portions are large. So be prepared to take half your dish home, which is just as good the next day. All in all, the service is wonderful and the food is outstanding. If you have yet to try Mediterranean food, why not start with the best...OR try someplace else and then try The Persian Room to compare. You can thank me later. ;)"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of ethnic foods! This place had great good, It was easy to be seated without a wait. For a first time try one of the platters that offer a little taste of the different dishes. My favorite was the beef stew style dish, I am unsure what their name for it was but the meat  was very tender with lots of flavor! YUM!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, service, food- everything here is so good. I live in Virginia but visited Scottsdale for a couple days, and I can honestly say this place has the BEST  food ever. I'm typically not a fan of most Persian restaurants but this place is straight up amazing. My food was cooked perfectly, the workers were super nice/ helpful, and I'm seriously looking forward to visiting again when I come back to AZ."}
{"text":"Others seem to love this place, unfortunately my experience wasn't the same. Came in and waited nearly 5 minutes just to be acknowledged and was told I should be seated shortly. After 15 minutes of waiting and watching other folks come in and I was still ignored by the host, I gave up and left. 

Normally I wouldn't write a review like this, but this is my second experience. I was here two months ago and had a very similar experience where I was ignored and ended up leaving to find another place to eat."}
{"text":"I have been coming in for years now and have always been treated with great service but not this time. I had called in trying to place a to go order, Vanessa had picked up the phone and began to take my order I had a few questions for her because I wanted to order something new. all I got back was attitude, I could even hear her talking to people in the background. Owner needs to do something about customer service- attitude is not professional."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Excellent service.  Nice ambiance.  Good prices.  I could go on and on but the five stars and use of the word \"Excellent\" are pretty self explanatory.  You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Prepare to be stuffed!!

When you sit down, you get a plate of herbs, butter, raw onion and a basket of incredible fresh baked pita.  If you're avoiding carbs don't even smell the pita bread, you'll be off the wagon in minutes - it really is that outstanding.

As others have mentioned, the hummus is excellent as is the hummus and eggplant delight (they blend the eggplant into the hummus, it isn't chunky). Side order of mixed vegetables is huge and super fresh, all cooked to a nice firm/tender consistency in a flavorful tomato broth.

I've had the veggie kebab a few times, it has hints of spice and has the flavor of being grilled over charcoal - so delicious!!!  It is also huge and comes with a mountain of basmati rice, easily a meal for two people.  Friends have raved about the beef and lamb dishes with the lamb koobideh receiving especially rave reviews.  The prices are extremely reasonable for the quality and quantity.  Service has been mostly great with only one visit that put me off a bit.

It's better as a lunch spot in my opinion, they have tons of kids in here at night so the idea of fine dining kind of goes out the window.  Not a good wine selection (not good at all) but that's to be expected.  Parking is kind of a nightmare, they have very narrow spots so be prepared.  

You don't have to love, like or know anything about Persian food to enjoy what they have to offer, don't miss out!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to Persian room but it's a joke now. Went there yesterday for Mother's Day, waited about 10 minutes to be sat which was not a biggie. We were sat and given water right away. Our server, Alex, looked/ acted miserable. Put a smile on your face your job is really not that hard, no one forces you to work here. Anyways while we were waiting for our food to arrive we noticed a party close by that had just been seated get up and leave, leaving their water and pita bread behind. Inside of bussers bussing the table the hostess decided to seat another family at that same table with the same waters from the previous families still on the table. I watched the hostess giggle and smile at each other after the family sat down with no understanding of what just happened. The hostess looked like they were all going clubbing had the shortest dresses on. I'm sorry but there's a bunch of families around you, Persian room isn't a young hip place it's meant for families...put some pants on or at least a longer skirt. I just got really bad vibes from those girls. The food was subpar. I got very bad stomach pains at night from the food. Won't be going back because I'm just completely disgusted."}
{"text":"They are usually very friendly and the restaurant is a very nice environment. However, the last couple of times I went in, it was very busy and the service and food was not that great."}
{"text":"Persian is my favorite cuisine and they have the best koobideh I've tried as well as excellent fresh pita, hummus, and baba ghanouj. Prices are high because the portions are large, and they are not a place to go if you want to eat healthy or share (they charge to split). They give basil and onion with their pita which pair well with the hummus. Very good food, but a little too formal imo."}
{"text":"I'm Persian  (i came from San Jose CA to visit my friend and they took me to Persian room) and this is the best Persian food outside of Iran and CA! Try the koobideh  you won't regret it! very flavorful, delicious food."}
{"text":"The Persian Room was a great choice for our rehearsal dinner, and they were quick to accommodate our group of 30+ with a week's notice. They placed us upstairs, and we had the whole area to ourselves.

For 30$/person, we got soft drinks/sodas, a couple of appetizers, plenty of rice, and multiple meats. The appetizers we got were: shallot/yogurt dip, hummus, and tadig w/stew. I usually love tadig (have had it previously as well), but this time it wasn't nearly as good. Maybe it's because the stew wasn't served on top of the crispy rice? I'm not sure.  The other appetizers were fine.

There was a long lag between the appetizer courses and the mains, but it was worth the wait. Everyone loved the meats - chicken kebab, chicken pieces, beef kabobs (koobideh), and whole beef pieces. Everyone was served individual enormous plates of rice as well.  The rice is addicting! There were also a couple of grilled tomatoes as well.

They packed all the leftovers up for us, and there was about 6 or 7 boxes for us (breakfast the next day).

4 stars: excellent mains, provided options for vegetarians, service, accommodating on short notice.

minus 1 star: tadig not up to regular standards, would have appreciated a group menu (were told that it doesn't exist?) to make choices."}
{"text":"I have never tried Persian food before.  But, I'm on vacation!  I have to do something different.  The Persian Room was easy to find and park.  I am a gluten intolerant, vegetarian, so that can make finding a good place to eat a challenge.  I called ahead to find out if I could find anything gluten free.  The pitas and the pasta were the only problems.  I couldn't pronounce my choice so I pointed to it and my waiter helped me out.  They immediately brought us a plate of pita bread, butter, a large, peeled onion and some nice raw basil.  Since I couldn't eat the pita I experimented with buttered basil leaves with the onion.  The onion was too hot for that.  So, I saved it for my takeout to cook at home.  I ordered an appetizer of dolmeh.  It was a nice little plate with 6 dolmeh, lettuce, lemon slices and peppers.  Our meals came soon after finishing that.  The portions were large and tasty.  Our server was very nice and helpful.  The prices weren't bad either.  I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Best food in Phoenix!  Meats perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Most impressive is the chicken which is usually dry and over cooked but here it's perfectly cooked, still juicy and delicious."}
{"text":"The service was not fantastic, however the food was pretty good. I felt they kept avoided my husband and I and we kept trying to get the attention to order, but the kept walking by us!"}
{"text":"best persian restaurant I've been to in the US..
Great service 
very clean and classy 
delicious food
fresh bread from oven
Hummus is A MUST HAVE"}
{"text":"I'm kicking myself for not coming here sooner. We came on a Wednesday and the place was almost full. You may want to make reservations. We started with the Dolmeh (stuffed grape leaves) appetizer. Best I've had. Similar to what you'll taste at Greek restaurant but better. My wife had the Chicken Koobideh and I had the lamb version. Huge plate with two long strips of tender and very tasty meat. It came with rice that was perfectly cooked but lacked a little flavor. The bread that comes with the meal is delicious and plentiful. For dessert try the baklava and tea combo for $6.95. Huge portion of baklava and the most fragrant tea. We were also given a sample of Persian ice cream which is vanilla flavored with rose water and saffron. Out waitress was very friendly but some other attendants were less personable and all business. That's the only reason I can't give Persian Room 5 stars. Great value. Will definitely repeat."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Crowded so have to make reservations. Hummus is best in the city, favorite dish are the lamb shanks but chicken sultan And gyros are also very good.  Fish kabob is amazingly moist unlike dried out sponges in other restaurants."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place was the decor. Food, service, everything else is so average. I was really expecting more. It wasn't horrible, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is the best in middle eastern food in the valley.  Lost count on how many times I've been here.  There's not a single bad thing I can say about this place.  They do get extremely busy on weekends so please stop your complaining on service.   The food is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"My foodie friends ate here.  They said the food was awful, and they couldn't figure out why it was so busy.  One of them got food poisoning from the chicken koobideh.  She spent several hours in the bathroom getting over it.  Nice!"}
{"text":"We went for Shish Kabob.  Had been to The Flaming Kabob on Baseline and Gilbert Road but did not like the interior atmosphere.  While the Persian Room was beautiful inside, the food was not even close in taste or quantity to The Flaming Kabob.  At the Persian Room we received one skewer of Shish Kabob for $22.95.  At the Flaming Kabob we were given three skewers for $17.95.  The size of the Lamb chunks on the skewer at The Persian Room were half the size of those at the Flaming Kabob.  We will return to The Flaming Kabob from now on."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Ate at a the bar because the restaurant was so busy.  Bartender was really nice and very attentive.  Had an appetizer plate with hummus, yogurt, grape leaves and salad and the hummus and yogurt was some of the best we have ever had!  For dinner we shared the chicken breast kabob in which the check was very tender.  Pita bread also tasted home bread.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The decor is gorgeous and it isn't too loud inside. We ordered the hummus and this is reason enough to go there. It was delicious and they gave us a large amount of pita. The Lamb kabob was delicious too, and it came out very fast! We had leftovers and we ate them all the next day."}
{"text":"Refused for a to go order on new years eve. If they don't have enough catering why keep the restaurant open? 
Restaurants can't refuse to take to go order. It's very bad service. The manager refused to make more reservations, I'm really disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food overall. The chicken breast is dry but if you order the thigh meat - it's INCREDIBLE. We visited a few times and the food is ALWAYS good. 
Giving it only 3 stars because the service sucks. Consistently. But we already go there knowing we'll be ignored by the servers and served someone else's dish from time to time so if you lower your expectations in regard to service you can really enjoy the good food."}
{"text":"I sure do miss the pita bread that was served here in the past. They now serve flatbread and on my recent visit it was mostly burned, While I like the food, he chicken shishkabob w vegetables came out with mostly burned onion and very little green pepper. Maybe that's because the large plum tomato took longer to cook than the small pieces of other vegetables.  Someone in the kitchen was off this night."}
{"text":"I love taking visitors here because the decor Is beautiful and the food is delicious. It's a bit pricey so it's not something I'll eat too often, but it is well worth the visit. The yogurt and cucumber appetizer is delish as is the hummus. The bread is amazing! Try not too get too full off of it before the main meal because the food comes in big portions. Their lamb dishes are one of my faves. But I usually get one of the combo plates to share with a friend and to try a bit of everything. Would def recommend!"}
{"text":"Having Persian friends in LA take me to some insanely good places to eat whenever I've headed out that way, I've been a little tentative about trying out Persian food here in the Valley. Safe to say, the Persian Room is a definitely a great place to satisfy my hunger whenever those cravings hit me. 

Just so you know up front, this is not some casual, mom-and-pop ethnic joint that you can enjoy in your shorts, flip-flops and Cartman tshirt. This place is what they call \"fancy\". Or \"fine dining,\" if you will: chandeliers, white tablecloths, marble fixtures, water features,  wine list, classical music, high ceilings, etc. But don't let this description and north Scottsdale location intimidate  or turn you off, though. The waitstaff is anything but snooty, and neither is anyone eating there. The servers are pretty friendly, unpretentious folk who will answer any questions you may have about the food. 

And the food. 

Man. I may be biased because I'm a sucker for good Persian grub, but if you haven't had any, I strongly recommend checking this place out whenever you feel like a nice meal out. One of my favorite Persian dishes is zereshk polo, which is saffron rice with barberries. I got it served on a platter with a long skewer of tender, marinated chicken fillets and a grilled tomato. All done really well. Now, I'm reserving star #5 for checking a few other dishes out later, since some of those LA Persian restaurants definitely were out of this world, but this would definitely get 4+ stars from me for now. 

Dishes here may not be the cheapest grub around (entree plates run from anything in the low 10's to the low 20's), but if you want to treat yourself to something besides a steak for once, I'd strongly recommend this joint. 

And besides, they serve Persian ice cream, which is kind of like vanilla ice cream mixed with rosewater and pistachios. Now can you go wrong with that combination, eating it spoonful by spoonful while relaxing in some shmancy air conditioned dining room while you've temporarily escaped the stifling heat? I'd say you can't.

So what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Excellent food, it was very busy so we had to wait a while to be seated. Wait staff was nice we did have to ask someone other than our server for small plates to eat a shared dish on. The parking was a little difficult and the area outside of the resturant was a little dirty with beer bottles in the parking lot. All in all it was good."}
{"text":"This was my first Persian restaurant; thought that it was very good.  Great flavors, the meat was done just right.  Help was good at explaining what to order.  Will return for sure.  Note: it's a ton of food.  Sharing is advised."}
{"text":"Great Persian food. Be prepared to be totally satisfied!"}
{"text":"Combination kabobs are excellent. Wonderful treatment of rice.  Definite value, with a nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place was a total beauty!!  From the palace looking building till you walk in. This place had a soothing ambience, rich ethnic setting and has class.

 The food is as good as a place, but i warn you, make sure you come with an empty stomach and a large appetite. The food here comes in large proportions where its good to share with family and friends. 

First thing I had ordered where the lamb shanks and it was a win! They serve alcoholic beverages and mixed drinks made by the bar tender. Yes, they have a mini bar downstairs and i think upstairs as well. I Never got the chance to go to the 2nd level but to my understanding it was a lounge area.
The server we had was polite and so was the busser.

I would most definitely like to come back for another visit just because the experience was outlandish."}
{"text":"real excellent food, good service (could be better) and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"We loved Eddie, and his very appeasing accent. He was very good and so comedic. Great service, great food, and great ambiance, and would recommend this restaurant to everyone. He made for a great evening and we loved his accent and comedic ways!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My family & I have been going here for years and the food never disappoints! The flat bread they bring out at the beginning is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Great rice, hummus was very good and great bread. The chicken is very juicy and flavorful."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. The number 49 was perfect all around. The lamb kabob was a little tough so I recommend getting it medium rare or skipping it altogether. The bread is heavenly along with the fresh basil and onion they bring out. Really thought this might have been the best food we had while in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS. It's beautiful inside and the service is good. But real talk about \"why\" i chose to write a review. It's 2017 -- enough with bringing out water glasses with straws without asking. Not only is this the desert (where water is already scarce) but by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean. ENOUGH WITH THE AUTOMATIC WATER! While you're at it, let's all stop sucking together and dump the straws."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for great Persian food.  I've been coming to this place since 2008.  They have a variety of great dishes.  One of my favorite dishes is the Tah Dig. Its a appetizer and great to share with. Its delicious with the cucumber yogurt dip. My go to dish is probably the Koobideh.  Its  mixture of ground beef with various seasoning, its awesome with the jasmine rice.  On this night I decided to go with the Loobia polo & koobideh which is in this picture.  Overall we had good customer service and the food was delicious as usual.  I would recommend this place

One strange encounter during the night though, I can't stop thinking about, I just have to share.  So I arrived around 7:30 and put my name down for 4 people.  I was told it's going to be a hour or hour and 20 mins wait.  I told them that is fine.  Well my fiancee told me that her younger brother and his lady will be joining us.  So a total of 6 now.  So I went back in with my lady and said, can you make it a table for 6...Then they proceeded to say, \"We can seat you right away.\"  That was strange.  If we wanted a table for 4, the wait was over a hour, but if we wanted a table for 6, we were seated right away...Interesting.

Regardless, that aside the meal was great and we received good customer service."}
{"text":"The Persian Room is very elegant.  The service is good and the food is excellent.  We will definitely come back, the lunch price is very reasonable and
portions are generous"}
{"text":"Thankfully, the Persian Room has met my expectations successfully, and proved to be a good representative for a Persian/Iranian Restaurant in the west. I recommend this restaurant for many reasons, one of them; they are sticking with the same kind of food in I.R. Iran and you would enjoy the seasons on it without any kind of spices and the service there are very friendly and they would be more than welcome if you asked them about their culture. However, the restaurant is a little bit pricey so you better go to it when you are hungry to exploit every penny you throw there."}
{"text":"WOW GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE. We had great service at persian room the food and spetizer was amazing. this is the place I will Recommend to friend and family"}
{"text":"Best Iranian food I ever had , service always perfect and food always fresh , and Vanessa she did great service , I will always come back"}
{"text":"Finally got to get out to the Persian Room came here with one of my buddies for lunch super fancy inside love the decor that kind of scared though I was expecting the foods to be super expensive at least a lunch wasn't I want that chicken sutan or something like that it was chicken kebab and  ground beef patty on a kabob with rice and salad or 15 bucks chicken kabob was flavorful and cooked perfectly and not dry but was very moist beef heart very Bland moist but had no flavor didn't really like it price was great like the flavor the texture everything so it was okay  the portion is huge it's more rice salad but still it's huge I finished half of it and couldn't go no further I would recommend sharing the plate with somebody else I also like the bread was quite delicious pretty sure they make it in house and the side of onions and greens nice touch service was horrible or just understaffed not sure which had to wait 20 minutes for a table even though there was 20 tables open finally got sat took awhile for them to come and greet us and not one that came to table was friendly they all had scowl looks on their face all they can answer was yes and no questions very short with you overall pretty decent place I probably go back especially for the lunch pricing really"}
{"text":"Excellent waitress, tasty food! The Eggplant Hummus was really delicious and the lamb was tender and flavorful. The only complaint would be how long the hostess took to seat us. She answered phones for a good ten minutes before even saying hello! She stopped to help a few men first so me and my friend were confused. It wasn't busy so once she sat us our waitress was awesome. The food was delicious and the Naan as well. I'll definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and dinner!  Portions are generous and ambiance is great and classy.  It feels like you're near the Mediterranean...excellent service and friendly wait staff.  We absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and the Persian macaroni was very tasteful! Our server was also amazing and so attentive!"}
{"text":"In all honesty, having had a very long history in eating middle eastern foods with middle eastern friends and locally owned restaurants in my home town of Houston. I can honestly say this was the worst place I have been to.

The food is very limited in variety and flavor. The silverware is laid out on the table itself, which is very non-hygienic. When asked for new silverware, they placed it all on the table again, and went through a mental brain freeze when told why I wanted clean silverware.

I am the least picky of people I think, but I for the higher price that I paid for this restaurant after positive reviews - I am upset that I did not get good service or good food.

The meats are made rubbery, the rice is made in bulk and with little seasonings, not even saffron is on it (very common spice among these foods). 

If you want a good middle eastern place to eat, do not go here, where you are pirce gouged and not given good utensils.

I believe most here have not had the opportunity to eat at a real authentic middle eastern restaurant, where it's very affordable (avg. should be about $9 a meal), and with better hospitality.

Go elsewhere and save your money please."}
{"text":"Been here a few times over the past few years. Poor service. They rush you outta there. No complimentary anything for celebrations. No smiles from waiter. Food is ok, not the best & not the worst. The only outstanding thing about the Persian Room is the fresh bread & fresh basil. In conclusion it's time to try a new dine in middle eastern restaurant for sure!!!!! You guys need to step up ur service game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for the memories."}
{"text":"1. Careful - the chairs have wheels.
2. Don't mess around. Go straight for the meat.
3. If there are two of you, go for the platter.
4. Of the chicken, get the kabobs (succulent thigh meat)
5. Must get koobideh
6. Mist get lamb shish- medium well
7. Must try the homemade yogurt drink-- preferably flat.
8. Tip well. Thank me later."}
{"text":"I was extremely underwhelmed.

The decor fit a higher end Persian restaurant and the service was average. I am not normally a fan of basil but the basil and onion with their homemade bread was good.

We started off with the hoummos and eggplant but they messed the order up! As the entrée, we ordered the Tour of Persia and a large Greek salad with a skewer of chicken. The portions were good but it all went down hill from here. The rice was undercooked to the point that it frequently got stuck in my teeth. The chicken was undercooked,  as well,  but was seasoned well. The salad was extremely poorly cut and was difficult to eat because of that. 

Then at the very end they kept both appetizers on the bill, even though we only ate one! 

I had heard a lot of good things about this place but I won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The best Persian food in Arizona, hands down!  That being said, there are only a few Persian restaurants in Arizona anyway.  But still, I'd compare this place to anywhere in LA/OC.

Great atmosphere too.  Clean and classy."}
{"text":"Great persian food.  Bread is homemade in fron of you.  Portions are huge, my wife and I always share.  We have been here at least 12 times and food and service are always outstanding.  Food is always great.  We usually have the combo dish (filet and kofta) with rice.  This is plenty for 2 people.  Also, their chicken is amazing.  Never dry and always well marinated.  The lamb dish is pretty good but not the best in town."}
{"text":"I recently have team members in town from out of state.  I used to eat here all the time, so suggested it for the team dinner location.  I used to make the drive from Chandler to have dinner here, and was always impressed with the food.  The chicken or beef koobideh is always a favorite of mine, and another is Ghormeh sabzy but I always ask for it to be served with crispy rice.  Yum.  I honestly think that you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum, YUM. What can I say? I love lamb. The Persian Room is the perfect place to go on a quiet date, a family get-together, whatever. All of the food is absolutely delicious. There are all different types of rices you can order with your main feature; my favorite is the one that comes with sour cherries.

The service is always great and everyone seems to be genuinely happy to be there. You should try the eggplant hummus with the fresh basil and pita they bring out. So, so good. Service and food times can take a little longer here due to demand, so I'd make sure you're planning on making an evening of it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Persian Room about five times over the last two years.  It is a nice restaurant but can get a bit noisy on Friday and Saturday nights. Therefore, we prefer to go there for lunch over dinner.
There is a regular menu and a lunch menu.  If you order from the lunch menu (an item with meat such as a chicken kabob) it is not that much less to order a larger portion from the regular menu and then have some to take home for lunch the next day.  My point being, the difference in price between lunch and dinner is not great enough compared to how much less meat you receive.
We stopped ordering the ground lamb and beef kabobs because we found the spices were more and more lacking as time went by.  Also, we found the beef and lamb kabobs to be mushy, they don't have the nice crust on them the chicken does.  
If you want meat, I recommend staying with the white meat chicken which has always been  moist and tender.
We usually get 1/2 salad and 1/2 rice.  Otherwise, you wind up with a big pile of rice, much more than you would need for your meal.  It looks like you are getting a lot of food, but if you take the rice off the plate, not so for the price.
Upon arrival, you are served an ample amount bread with fresh herbs, butter, and a fresh white onion to wrap up and enjoy.  My husband and I always look forward to this.  It is a wonderful type of appetizer with a beer!
We find the service slow and lacking a bit each time we go, but are used to it now and don't go there to eat when we are on a time schedule.
The hummus is very nice - creamy and plenty of it for the price.
There is a dish on the menu that is an appetizer stew of types served on a bed of crisp rice.  We found the rice to be so crisp and hard we could not eat it.  The idea is the sauce from the stew penetrates the rice, but there was not enough sauce for this to happen.  I have noticed other Yelp reviewers commented on dishes with sauce also - not enough.  We tried this appetizer twice thinking one time the crispy rice issue may have been a fluke, but both times the rice were so hard it was if they had never been cooked in the first place.  Not worth breaking a tooth over!  
The grilled tomato does not come on all kabob platters, if you want one, be sure to ask for one.
Therefore, due to the inconsistency with the kabob seasonings, because of the slow lunch service (meaning receiving the check so you can go), and portions and because some of the dishes are not quality controlled consistently, I gave them a four-star raring."}
{"text":"Persian Room is that type of place you go back. I actually never dined in, always go takeout and boy, are they amazing! Takeout food is usually subpar, but at Persian Room, it's probably as good! And the garlic yogurt! They give you a whole container of it, so you have enough for the leftovers the next day. That place is simply perfect!"}
{"text":"Locally owned cuisine that is unique compared to all the \"beige\" in SoNoSco (south north Scottsdale lol). As an Armeek (Armenian-Greek), I am pretty familiar with middle eastern food. And this place measures up relatively well! One indication is all the Persians and Armenians that frequent this restaurant! Don't be shocked by the raw onion and basil that gets placed on your table right away--this is traditional; pair it with a buttered bread--delish! Anything you order here is good but go for the skewered meats!"}
{"text":"Attentive service and plenty of good food. Veg friendly. Maybe 2.5 dollar signs, although the happy-hour discounts are significant."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday for a nice lunch. The place was packed, the food is delicious and the ambiance is wonderful. We had a very polite server and busser. They were on point with everything, not just our table but all tables. We had the Tour of Persia which comes with barg (filet mignon), koobideh (beef), Cornish (BBQ chicken) and gheymeh bademjan (lentil bean and beef stew) served with Zereshk polo (white rice with barberrys) and Basmati rice. I also ordered a side of gormeh sabzy (green herbs and beef stew). The meats were very tender, the Cornish was the best I have ever tasted besides that of my friend. The food was enough for four in total so we had left overs which I was very pleased with and happy to take for lunch the next day. This is a place I could eat at daily and never tire of."}
{"text":"This place became frequent on my check-in's for two reasons :

1. This place deserves stars for the interiors and also for their staff prompt and responsive service. Little expensive place for the main menu items but they have good lunch specials. 
Many places, portion of food they serve in lunch specials will be little less but here you can see good portion which is definitely more for one.

2 . Coming to the taste and quality of the food, they are the best in the valley for Persian food. Their meat is very tender and fresh . Their spice levels are acceptable for all taste buds and also can be customized.

I would recommend this place who is looking for a elegant place and tasty food.

Best Deal : Sometimes they appear to be on Group on , which is a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, wonderful service.  I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant and would love to got back"}
{"text":"I went back here to give this place another try after the last fiasco, this time for lunch with a groupon and we went when it just opened for the day.

The service was a big improvement, prompt, friendly, and the check came out correctly. This is why I upgraded the review to 2 stars. The food was not good, though, so I cannot come back.

I ordered zereshk polo (which with barberry rice). The chicken was waaaaaaaay oversalted and tasted like it was swimming in oversalted pizza sauce. I couldn't eat it. Though I have had barberries in my rice before and like the dish, at this restaurant the rice tasted more like Uncle Ben's instant rice instead of delicious basmati rice that I specifically come to a Persian restaurant for. Not good... AT ALL.

My husband ordered a beef gyro and while portion size was good, the beef was as bland as could be. Overall, we enjoyed basically the fresh basil, onion, and bread, which was the free part of the meal. We will not be returning. We'll go to Pars restaurant instead next time."}
{"text":"Been there over 6 times, love the food and enjoy every bite of it. For their price, it is a large amount of food that you can eat and have plenty to take home to. Place might look a little old, specially the tables and chairs when they squeak as you sit down. And no, I do not weight 500 pounds... Their Koobidah  (ground beef), Chicken Kabob, Lamb shank, and Burberry rice are my favorites. Service is very slow and some of the servers can be borderline rude and can take forever to serve or come back for refills. So, I hope they will read these reviews and do something about their service, it will be a shame for this place to have lesser customers when they serve such a great food. Once the service gets better, I will be sure to give them 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"I have been here several times, and I'm from Southern California.  The only time we're in the area is for work.  I travel with about 5 Iranian coworkers (I'm Iranian as well) and this is one of the best Persian restaurants we've ever been to.  Who knew we'd have to go all the way to Scottsdale for amazing Persian food? 

The atmosphere is very elegant and the service is very friendly, even for a large group."}
{"text":"I am constantly on the hunt for good Mediterranean food and that extra creamy hummus (does anyone remember Shish Kebab House at 43rd Ave and Olive? RIP) . We went to the Persian Room for lunch on a Monday. We had good service and fantastic food. The waitress wasn't super friendly but she was prompt, got our order right and kept our drinks filled, which in my world qualifies as great customer service. More importantly the food was great. The HUMMUS WAS DELICIOUS. The koobideh was well spiced and there was a chicken, beef, or lamb option. I overheard what must have been the owner/manager patiently explaining a variety of menu items to a customer who had not had Persian food before. I drove miles out of my way to go to this restaurant because I had heard such great things. This will definitely be one of the first places I go when I am home in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We come here once a month and we feel like the service is declining. The food is still amazing. Yesterday we were in at 815 and of course knew what we wanted already. The waiter said he put our food in at 822 but it didn't go through. We finally got our food at 910. The waiter was so nice (rashon). The manager, however, only took 4$ off of our bill. He might as well have not done anything. Learn how to treat your customers!! Whatever manager was working on 3/2 at 9 pm - he sucks"}
{"text":"You know how there are places where you enter and you are like \"Wow! since when did I start making such amazing decisions\" This was one such place.
Ambiance: Perfect, complimenting that \"fine dining restaurant\" tag they have below their name. The noise level was moderate. I don't remember the music.

Staff: Very very pleasant people, very concerned about helping us make the best choices in food and drinks. Coming up to us every now and then to make sure we liked everything and cater to what else we needed.

Food:
They serve house pita(unlimited and on the house) and a salad to start with. Which is so delicious that you can fill your stomach just with that. I couldn't stop on it and had to take most of my main dish to-go.
Appetizer: We got the Hummus which was right amount creamy and right amount granular. 
Main Course: I ordered the lamb shank, which tasted brilliant. Lamb cooked properly and the soup really yummy. It came with rice which had fava beans mixed into it.
My friends ordered the Chicken Kebab and Chicken Shish which were great too. 
Drinks: We got their Homemade yogurt drink which had yogurt, soda and mint in it I guess, and tasted just wow. We also got their \"Peach Pear-Fection\" cocktail which my frain said was good.

In all a brilliant place. Would recommend it to everyone looking for a family meal, date night or just to hang out with friends for good food."}
{"text":"It's above average, does not live up to my expectation having experienced outstanding Iranian grill in California. Portions are generous. Fresh baked flat bread is fantastic. Chicken koobideh is very good. Beef koobideh has been minced in a food processor and does not have a traditional texture of a koobideh, but it's very tasty. Chairs and tables are due for a refinish."}
{"text":"Great persian food in the heart of Scottsdale.  It was one of the best persian restaurants I've eaten at and that includes a lot of them in L.A.  Great appetizers, kabobs, home made bread (see my photo) and it seems really popular because it was busy on a Sunday night.  My husband is Iranian and is a great cook and he loved it.  I don't really agree with Ann on the location being weird.  It is on Scottsdale Rd. not far from the new Scottsdale Quarter, shopping and other restaurants."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now, going back the second time hoping that it would be a better experience.  It wasn't, really.  

The decor is very over-the-top.  Original, I guess, is one way to put it.  When we arrived, they were very busy.  Didn't seem like they were handling the many patrons who were waiting for a table all that well.  We were finally seated and ordered.  Service, overall, was spotty and a bit slow.  We ordered an appetizer, which never made it out.  We mentioned this when our meals were brought to us, and it was removed from our bill.  The meals themselves were pretty good - be prepared for tons and tons of rice (over half the plates of our main dishes were rice).  Wish there was more meat than rice, but the lamb loin that I had was pretty good.  My wife enjoyed her chicken (and heaping mounds of rice).  

Probably the most unique item I had was the desert.  I have a sweet-tooth, and found their original Persian ice cream to be quite tasty.  It had a hint of rose petal infused with pistachio, and I really enjoyed it.

Though it's close by to us, I don't know if we'll be in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"The food was a little bland for my tastes, but this was the first time I had Persian food so maybe that's part of the deal. 

I sat in a broken chair and told the staff about it. They suggested \"don't worry about it\".  I had to grab a chair from another table. Outside of that, the service was good. 

The portions are huge and it was fun trying a different type of restaurant. If I go back, I will sneak in some tobasco..."}
{"text":"Five stars for delightful service and very good food. The area isn't exactly a hot bed of middle eastern cuisine. But, the PR makes the grade with ample servings of tasty meats and vegies. Four of us celebrated a bday here. We ordered two platters for two each and we had enough food for two for the rest of the week. Fresh ingredients seasoned well for al those tastes this genre is known. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Persian food YOU MUST COME HERE. This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley, and I always take out-of-town guests here (and they always love it). 

No offense to Brian, but I don't really think it's fair to compare Persian Room to Indian food  (although I agree Tandoori Times is great for Indian cuisine). Persian food has very different flavors and its even very different from food in Arab countries. I love their stews, some of which have dried black lemons in them, which give a great, earthy, sour flavor. 

Try the rice with the barberries -- it's really good. Although, if you go with a group, make sure to get their appetizer platter. They hummus and eggplant mixture is AMAZING, as is their fresh bread which they serve with butter and fresh mint.

If you're adventurous, try the chicken fessenjaan, which is made with a pomegranate walnut sauce -- it's a very unique flavor.

As a side note, Persian Room catered my wedding this past fall. It was such a bargain, compared with other caterers, and the food was absolutely delicious, from the beef to the chicken to the veggie stew and salad. Everyone loved it."}
{"text":"This place looked pretty nice from the inside and they weren't kidding when they said that the Tour of Persia would be able to serve 3.  For 2, it was a bit overwhelming, but I think we dented it pretty well.  The Basmati rice was very complimentary to the meat dishes.

We switched the barg for the fish, but otherwise the cornish, beef koobideh and gheymeh bademjan was okay.  I could have done without the gheymeh bademjan.  It was my first time having it and it was only okay.  The koobideh was a little greasy, but the cornish had a great lemon tang to it."}
{"text":"I have been here so many times when I lived in AZ. I'm statisfied everytime I came to this place. Great food, nice atmosphere, good service."}
{"text":"The perfect business or executive lunch. Speedy lunch service at a great price and the atmosphere will most certainly impress. Cannot recommend any scottsdale or phoenix restaurant more highly for lunch service. 

The portions here are truly large and the meat is very high quality. The Persian Room is certainly a gem in the East Valley, with comparable quality to Los Angeles' best. 

Great wine and desert selections, especially the roulette. It is very light and goes great with tea to complete that perfect traditional Persian feast!"}
{"text":"Looking for large portions sizes and upscale decor? This is the place for you! You don't have to be familiar with persian food to order, the menu lists and describes every dish. We got the veggie platter and the mahi mahi. The vegetables were cooked just right so it wasn't too soggy. The fish meat was juicy and delicious.  We saw a lot of families with children as well as couples on dates so it can be used for all occasions! I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a fancier place that can do family style eating so everyone at the table can sample several dishes."}
{"text":"The food is bomb except for the eggplant appetizer. Barf. The meats are so good. Always been consistent. The waiter really irritated me. He would get two stars max! We had a huge platter of food left to take half the size of our table and he had us pack it up in to go boxes. We spent $90 just me and my husband and two young kids. The very least he could do is take it away and pack it for us. They used to do that a few years back. I was thoroughly annoyed. I still gave him 15% although I didn't want to. I don't want to jip the other staff. We got one drink refill and he checked on us maybe three times in 90 min. If they are reading this tell their waiter to get his head out of his arse. Put a freakin smile on his face. We were one of his very first tables at 4:30."}
{"text":"So sad to have had a negative experience here after so many good ones. 
Today was less busy than any other day we have visited the restaurant. 
The waitress came to our table to ask for our order and bring check. I between we had to ask passing servers for service. 
When we the bill came we tried to use our Groupon and were told that we could not use it. When we have the waitress our debit card to pay the waitress overcharged our card. (Ludmila) was the name stated on the receipt. 

We are now currently waiting for her to return to our table to fix this issue. 

Two stars were due to the food and other servers being awesome.

General manager \"Carlos\" came to our table and treated us as it was our fault for groupon a being used in previous visits. He didn't even apologize for the waitress overcharging is just dismissed what I was saying and said it was an easy fix\"check your bills when Ludmila is your waitress.

Update: after having to show him we have been there many times with positive experiences, the general manager attempted to show us some fine print which even he could not find. He ended up letting us use the groupon with a heavy emphasis that it would not be allowed in future visits. Next time Carlos, how about a sorry about the inconsistency, and sorry for our server overcharging you. Don't blame customers for a waitress not checking up on a table and having your patrons flag down servers for service. 

Last time coming here!"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing,
We eat there at least once a week,For many years.
Definitely a place to go for people who appreciate good food and service."}
{"text":"Everything is very delicious as always, not my first time and definitely NOT my last! The portion are huge so don't be afraid to share. It's great for kids and family night dinners. Food is always fresh & delicious!"}
{"text":"The Persian Room would definitely come to mind if I was looking for a restaurant for a group dinner. Their portion sizes are large & the food is tasty, making it a good deal, especially if splitting the bill with multiple people!

My husband & I ordered the Chef's Special Combination Platter which came with chicken filet, chicken koobideh, & fish kebab, as well as Sabzy polo & basmati rice. My favorite thing on the dish was the Sabzy polo; the rice had a unique flavor with the parsley, dill weed, garlic, & cilantro. Both types of chicken & fish were well seasoned and tender, we enjoyed them all. The only reason I felt like the dish was lacking as a whole was due to everything being dry.

Although the menu listed the Combination Platter as a meal for two, we had enough for both of our initial dinner meals & then also to enjoy two more times. It was a lot of food!

Overall, our feeling was that we would return to this restaurant to try other dishes. The only drawback was the wait time. We were initially told about 45 minutes but it was really closer to an hour and a half. We had driven quite a ways to the restaurant which is why we waited. This was on a Friday night, so maybe other nights are better."}
{"text":"My wife and I had heard great things about the Persian Room and decided to give it a try.  The service and ambiance was very satisfying and commendable.  We were not as pleased with the food though.  We found the rice accompanying our dinners to be somewhat bland.  My wife had the basmati rice and I had a rice with dates and raisons that was supposed to be a specialty of the house.   My lamb loin was overly gamy and my wife's chicken dish was not as flavorful as she would have liked.   Dessert was a very good baklava and homemade ice cream"}
{"text":"Delicious Food

Food was so tasty and the portions were gigantic. There were four if us and we ordered a sampler for 2 and added an extra dish. We left with enough food for lunch the next day. 

The restaurant was packed and there were lots of people standing waiting for a table. Lucky we had a reservation or else we would have been waiting for a long while. Even with a reservation, we waited about 10 minutes. It was very loud from all the patrons talking and children yelling and screaming. Definitely not for a quiet romantic evening but if you are looking for great food and an energetic vibe, this is the place."}
{"text":"The chicken kebab and yogurt dip were delicious, but the service was insufferably slow."}
{"text":"We were at the Persian Room last night. They must have been having an off night. First of all, they were packed. Even busier than usual. Things didn't go right from the get go. Starting with my Grey Goose Vodka Gimlet that was brought out in an unattractive tumbler overflowing with ice cubes. This is a $13 drink and my expectations were higher. I fished all the ice cubes out of the tumbler, but then decided to send it back. It was brought back in a Martini glass which it should have been in in the first place ... the bread that was brought to the table was only warm. Usually, it is piping hot. We then ordered the Chicken Eggplant Borani which we have had before and loved. This time it didn't seem so good. The chicken didn't seem quite as moist as usual, but the eggplant was cooked perfectly. We also got an order of Dolmeh which we thought were unremarkable. Finally, we ordered the lamb shish kebab. Unfortunately, the lamb was barely warm and had to be sent back to the kitchen to be reheated. Our server was a very pleasant young woman who did the best she could under all the circumstances. The circumstances being that the restaurant was simply too crowded. Not sure what the answer is. Perhaps they need to consider opening a second location. Finally, this place is kid-friendly to the extreme. Full of families with kids ranging from a year old to their teens. Frankly, it didn't add much to the \"ambience.\" If you are looking for an adult dining experience, this likely isn't it unless you want to sit in the bar upstairs. All in all, it was disappointing and we're not at all sure we will be back."}
{"text":"I was absolutely wowed just walking in. Extremely fancy eastern feel all over from the table tops to the walls and high ceilings. We didn't have to wait too long to get seated and served as busy as it was. Very attentive service and amazing food. Overall I was left speechless, definitely stopping by next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"The best Persian restaurant in the valley, even better than any other Persian restaurant I have visited in LA."}
{"text":"Disclaimer.... I don't know jack about what Persian food should taste like.

That said, I've tried a bunch of things here and never had a meal I disliked.  I'll pile on the list of compliments for the bread, butter, basil onion starter...yum.

I've tried all the various koobidahs (sp?) and yum yet again.

And then there's the rice.  For me, most if the time rice comes with one of my meals and I see it as something to take up the extra space on the plate.  Not here.  The rice is well cooked and typically combined with fruits and stuff (in idea what but damn it's good) to the point where I enjoying as much as the meat!

But the best part for me is just walking into the place.  Not the decor, which is a little over the top, but the smell... Oh my god, it is like you just walked into a spice market, it is incredible!

My best recommendation, if you have a friend that is into Persian food, or better yet a Persian friend, bring them along as your food shepa.  Absent a little knowledge the menu can be intimidatingly vague.

I will be back again for a wonderful dining experience that is outside the norm for me."}
{"text":"Great food! brought my sister in-law and my mom lunch for mothers day and we had the appetizer sampler and the sampler platter with all the different meats and basmati. Awesome food!"}
{"text":"Place wasn't as 'stuffy' as I feared (I envisioned red velvet and gold tones everywhere, for some reason!), and the dining area was pleasant. Service was good without being over-bearing (the waiters seem professional, not high-school kids bugging you every 2 minutes asking you if everything is ok).  I had the lamb; it was tender, but somehow lacking in flavor.  Next time I'll try the cornish game hen, that sounds fantastic.  Funnily enough, I found the rice 'overpowering' - too much 'stuff' in it; I like my rice to be a bland counterpoint to the other strong flavors, but in this case the rice had more flavor(s) than the lamb!  

The location is a bit strange, but I'm getting used to that in Scottsdale - fine dining in the shadow of a hotel parking lot ... I'll review again after I try the chicken, and hopefully bump up the rating!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! The service was excellent, very nice fine dining establishment, and the food portions are enormous! A plate for one will easily feed two, the shared platters for two will feed four! I love lamb, but finding a place to serve it and to do it right is hard, here it was done just right. Personally I find this to be an excellent date place to introduce someone to new cuisine."}
{"text":"I think this place is ok. I have tried it a few times and I think there is a better food from Greek gyros. 
Which I love by the way.

{"text":"High end and authentic is all I can think of in regards to the Persian Room.

The ambiance is just spectacular for a weeknight dinner with friends, or even for couples.

All the appetizers are definitely worth trying, and the staff seems like is always wating to refill your drinks and the delicious pita bread to no end!

The entrees are amazing. The lunch portions are huge with rice and salad, and the dinner portions even bigger! I've eaten at a lot of places, but I can never seem to finish my entree! Ah well, that just means I can enjoy more at home =)

The price is a bit higher, but it's to be expected if you want to dine on food with class."}
{"text":"Persian Room is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. It never disappoints!  The hummus so yummy. We love the koobideh and barg. And the fluffy basmati rice is amazing."}
{"text":"Ticket times were a little long but overall the service and food was good. I had the Lamb Loin and the Saffron rice was unlike any other recipe I tried. We will return again."}
{"text":"It has been a long long time since I have been here. I'm glad I made it to a dinner here to remind me of the goodness tastes of the platter!! 

For a table of 10, we were seated in the upstairs area- which is common for a large group. Reservations can be made through OpenTable or calling in. A bar sits at the top along with a couple more large groups and small 2-4 off table seatings. 

Appetizer: Persian Room Appetizer Platter to share with the table. Combination of dolmeh (stuffed veggies in a grape leaf) , hummus & eggplant, yogurt & cucumber dip, and torshi (pickled veggies) a fun shareable platter. $15.95

Combination Platter: I shared the Chefs special platter (serves 2) but really could be made for 3-4 depending on your appetite. This includes the chicken filet, chicken kubideh, fish kebob (mahi mahi) sabzy polo (\"dirty rice\"- sprinkled with some cooked scallions and dill) and basmati rice. We subbed the chicken kubideh with beef kubideh. Both rice were large mounds of rice sitting on half the platter. Other half of he platter were aligned with a row of each meats and 2 grilled Roma tomatoes on each side. My favorite was the beef kubideh, then the juicy chicken filet and then the fish. $36.95 

Because gratuity is already added the server wasn't as attentive as he could be. Waters were not filled until the very end of dinner."}
{"text":"This is the only place that my daughter enjoy eating her chicken .
Have to say that their plate it is kind of huge especially when you must try the khash bathenjan ,so it is always good to share it with someone .
It is a right  place when you need to eat gluten free plate with a very soft meat .
the environment very welcoming ,So impressed with the new servers crew . 
We were so excited to see the same server \"Raheem \" he helped us last time and we were lucky to have him again he is so professional who made each visit to this place enjoyable ."}
{"text":"Food here was a revelation. Never had Persian food before (I know, odd, since we're from LA), but we were up for something different...decided to give this place a try, and...yum! They start you off with a basket of flat bread and a plate of raw (but super mild) onion, butter and fresh basil leaves -- weirdly delicious way to begin a meal. Hubby had the Cornish game hen and I had the lamb koobideh -- both juicy with incredible flavor. Both come with a grilled tomato and huge mound of rice, which is just, well, rice. Portions generally are enormous, so everybody leaves with left-overs!

Service is warm, friendly and efficient. They do a big business here, with lots of big groups, seniors, families -- quite a range -- so it's pretty loud. Decor is super kitschy, so you're not there for the scene, but we'll definitely be back, and probably do takeout."}
{"text":"I book to take 16 of my team members - everything starts of well. The first issue - they have two servers who divide the table by half and take order. They forget one main colleague and don't bother to take his order. Even water refill isn't provided. Secondly I had a gift card purchased at Costco that they wouldn't take. I wish i can give them a minus 5, terrible service."}
{"text":"Words cannot begin to describe how pleasantly surprised I was dining here. I was on a business trip and my hotel was conveniently located down the street from this restaurant. In short description, quality meets quantity. The warm bread they serve before the meal is fantastic, the rice is astounding, the meat is flavorful and juicy, the ambience is superb, the servers are attentive, and the portions are absurdly large. They certainly give the best Persian eateries in the country a run for their money. I am already looking forward to my next dining experience here."}
{"text":"You can learn a lot about a restaurant by how well they execute the \"little\" things. I found out about this place by asking a colleague while doing some work in Scottsdale, at first I was a little bit puzzled regarding why it is that they exactly recommended going to this place???

Here is one of those little things that got botched: When I call the restaurant for an order to go, I got put on permanent hold! Nothing makes me more furious than when I get sent into cyberspace-hold. But I looked at the clock, it was getting late and I thought to myself \"I sure would like to order some to go food and call it a night.\"

So I called back. This time they took my order straight away (nothing fancy, just an order of chicken shish kebab). They informed me that it would cost $19 and would be ready in 20 minutes.

Fast forward 20 minutes and I'm there to pick up my to go order. As I'm paying, a young lady walks up with my order to go. My timing was perfect! I get back to the hotel only to realize that I have someone else's order! I call in and inform them that I have someone else's order, and they say that they just realized the same thing! So this is the second little thing that a restaurant can and should be able to execute on. Young lady apologizes profusely, and agrees to run over my correct order to the hotel. No problem, I'll meet you in the lobby.

Five minutes later the young lady arrives and again apologizes profusely, and informs me that she has thrown in an onion with my order! I probably would have preferred to have had a dessert item, but I guess an onion will do - Yes, that's a picture of a quarter raw onion?!?

The chicken shish kebab is delicious, the rice is on point, they don't have any salad in the dinner (which I thought there would be?) but all in all this is a good four star experience. So why five stars then? When a restaurant makes a mistake and owns up to it, that goes along way in my book and it should in your's too. If you're in the area give this place a shot!

Satisfied? Yes

Return? Yes

Advocate? Yes"}
{"text":"The best authentic Persian food in AZ, everything is so good, and the staff are always friendly. We eat here 2-3 times a month!"}
{"text":"Great place for food! It's the best place to get Persian food in the Phoenix desert. While the spices used can sometimes be a bit repetitious as pointed out by other Yelpers, I think the sheer portion size of each dish makes up for the ironic blandness.

I ordered the barg filet mignon and koobideh (ground beef) dish which comes with rice as with most of their entrees. This dish was full of flavor, and as with most things served at the restaurant, it comes out with some chopped onions, fresh basil and cilantro, and butter with pita bread.

Man, they serve too much food! What's there not to like?!

I guess the only thing I can find criticism for is that they advertise this place as \"fine dining\", yet every time I walk in, I see people wearing shorts, jeans, t shirts, whatever. I mean, maybe the establishment tries to market themselves as \"fine dining\" to get people to spend more money? I dunno, but what I do know is that this place is NOT fine dining in the slightest. I actually think labeling themselves as such hurts them, especially when people call in to make reservations, show up, and find that they still have to wait a bit.

Anyway, as far as the food goes, it's good. Well seasoned, filled with flavors you don't find in American food, and balances out with the robustness of the fresh basil, cilantro and onions.

I will suggest getting the Turkish coffee after your meal. It's served in a tiny cup and is basically a really rich espresso shot, served with a couple sweet wafers. It gives you the right kick to feel awake after your large meal!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to eat. This place is close to authentic, dimly lit, and nicely put together. Staff is accomodating and helpful. Very tidy. Love their fresh naan with cilantro, basil, and onions. I always look forward to those whenever I come here. I love their koobideh as well with Basmati rice and grilled tomatoes. Driving here though is kind of a pain since I live in the West Valley. If I lived closer, I would come every week."}

{"text":"Food was okay but the portion sizes were ridiculous. One meal could serve 3 people and have everyone feeling full! I personally likes the rice the best, the meats were so so. The hummus appetizer also wasn't bad but I've had better hummus."}
{"text":"Our family's first time dining here. Not a good experience. Food are over cooked. Table is too small but they serve huge plates and server ware !! Our table was too congested to be comfortable to eat! Chairs are dusty! 
Too pricey but food was not great!
Server were not friendly. We hated this place. Definitely not coming back and will not recommend."}
{"text":"Over priced ! Waitress not that nice either ! He didn't seem to care for his job. Not sure what his deal is. Maybe bc we has a groupon ?"}
{"text":"This place has my favorite food in the Phoenix area.  And, if you like grilled meats, hummus and rice you will love it, too.

Disclaimer: I'm not a connoisseur of the depth of traditional Persian foods - I'm just a regular girl who loves her meats, veggies and rice. 

If it's your first time I HAVE to recommend you try the Barg - beef or chicken, they are both amazing.  The meats are tender and full of flavor.  The hummus here is one of my very favorites and the dipping bread they make on-site is perfect - even whole grain recently.  As for the rice, if you like tartness (think cranberries with a twist) I recommend upgrading your rice on the dish to the Zereshk - it's amazing.  The little red spice they offer on the table (Sumac) has a very slight lemon flavor and accents both the meat and the rice wonderfully.  I also sometimes order the koobideh - think meatloaf with lots of flavor.  I've not liked that in many Persian places but here is it very good.

The only hazard I have for you is that the portions are huge, so plan to have leftovers.  Highly recommended!"}

{"text":"Came here with my family.  Delicious food.  Everything tastes fresh and is served hot.  Fresh baked bread made close to our table.  Would go back again."}
{"text":"I love Persian food!  Best ever is home made, but this place does a very good job.  I had the Chicken Filet, very tender.  I switched out the rice for the loobia polo, (green beans & beef rice) - which was delicious.  My sister got the baghali polo with the mahi, she loved it!  The polo was great, I thought the mahi was just a little dry.  My husband got the chicken fesenjoon, which was delicious, and my brother-in law was in heaven with the chicken koobideh. It was his first time eating Persian food and he absolutely loved it. We ordered the tahdig, but ordered it dry (with out stew), next time I'll get it with the stew!
Service was good, food was delicious- portions are huge!!  It's definitely worth it!  Check it out!"}

{"text":"Was new to AZ so I was delighted when I found the Persian room! The food here is out standing!  From Kabibs to Beef Saltani it's incredible! The service is great as well. Fresh made Saj bread or pita bread is to die for.. Great cocktails there as well. They're pretty standard cocktails so don't expect mixologist there to know it all. All and all the food here is fantastic. I've never had a bad meal there. The beef that they serve is the best I've ever tasted. Just keep in mind on weekends it gets extremely busy and to be expected when your serving up the best in Persian food. The proportions are always generous too."}
{"text":"Came here with a meet up group of probably about 16 people. They sat us upstairs and brought us a weird appetizer of onions, basil and bread. Then left us for about 45 minutes before one of our group members decided to flag a waitress down to start our orders. It took us another hour to get our food. They brought pretty much all of our food at the same time instead of bringing it in sections. Our drinks were not refilled and mine was taken downstairs to be refilled and never was brought back up. One of the members asked for a second glass of wine and never got it. I gave the establishment two stars because the food was pretty decent but the service was terrible"}
{"text":"This was my first time having Persian food so I wasn't sure what to expect (I have no idea how this was my first time, my roommate is Persian ...) 

The decor is really pretty and totally sets the mood for the meal. Huge staircase in the middle of the room, flashy decor, it was awesome. 

On recommendation from the waiter we ordered the cornish and a beef shish kebab. (The food came out SO fast, so bonus pts from me). Both were very good! I usually prefer beef to chicken, but this time the chicken stood out more to me. It was marinated really well and perfectly crispy. Both came with whole roasted tomatoes and a heaping pile of rice. We had dolmeh as well, which I always love. 

We snagged bites off of our friends plates further down the table. By far my favorite was the lamb kebab. It was fantastic. 

Overall a fun, different place to try out when you're looking for a new cuisine!"}

I recently celebrated my birthday there and they easily accommodated 20+ people upstairs. The menu makes it easy to pick from. The drinks are reasonably priced. I love the hummus with the house made bread. You will always have leftovers and it taste just as good the next day. Awesome flavor, friendly staff. Only disappointment is poor parking. The place gets crowded quickly so be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"My husband and I were the only Caucasian Hispanic couple in the joint so I guess we got the visitors (non-ethic related) plate--one that was bland, skimpy, cold and had a hair in it.  I can't help but to notice that the BAD food is for the Gringos. 

Sunday was busy, we dressed casually and got the the bad joke about my hubby's t-shirt from the waiter. There were plenty of casual exercise wearing families there.
I would have been very upset had I felt like I dressed for a special occasion and received this Extremely Bad Food. 

Big deal on the decor, the inside looks like an over the top gaudy and old fashioned ethnic restaurant. My husband and I would have rather eaten at a fast food (forbidden for us) restaurant! 

Lamb was a cheaply cut, marinated in water and pounded to separate the grizzle. A measly 4- 1 inch pieces that aren't even 1 inch solid chucks of meat. 
Seriously, I can cook Persian food MUCH better.  The plate made the portions look large.  

The service was fast but the portions misleading and a TOTAL ripp off.

The waiter never checked on us. 

And how do you eat chunks of raw onion with basil and bread? Who wants to be around someone after eating raw onions--GROSS! 

I would give this zero stars but the yogurt dip was the only good thing.

Last Christmas it seemed like half of the staff that we had grown to like for so many years just got up and left. 
After our favorite staff members left the quality of this place went downhill, now every time we go back we hope that the old Persian Room will miraculously reappear. The new management and waitstaff don't make you feel warm and welcome anymore, even the owner Naser used to be so friendly seems to have a very different attitude as well. It seems like the general manager Carlos is constantly trying to correct mistakes that occur in and out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Best Persian food we meatlovers have ever had and we eat Persian whenever we can. Meats are grilled to perfection, rice is fluffy and plentiful, with multiple options to choose from for both. Portions are large, family style and readily shared. Lunch is a great value with salad included. Filet, chicken tender and koobideh are our favorite meats, with adas polo (contains dates and lentils) and loobia polo (contains green beans and chunks of meat) being our favorite rice options. The chicken/eggplant appetizer is delicious with crispy fried onions on top. We've been here at least 10 times over several years and the service and food are consistent - we have never had a bad meal. We wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to friends who have also found a new favorite."}
{"text":"I consider my self a bit of a food snob :). I have high standards growing up in NYC where we have a variety of cultures and a lot of competition. I also grew up in an Italian household with a mom that really knew how to cook! I typically try to find places where the food is excellent and the food quantity is healthy (big) thats number 1. The price has to be  reasonable thats my second criteria ( hate getting ripped off by expensive meals that fail to deliver high quality)  and the great service is third for me ( if the food is good and the price is good you can be rude all day and I won't care) . The ambiance, location or view typically doesn't matter much to me since some of the best food is served at \"dives\" or locations that are not so visually appealing or in the best parts of town. 

I explored a wide variety of restaurants  both family owned and chain in this city and I can say with confidence that Persian room is very close to the top . This place offers it all. First the food is excellent the portion size is enough for the biggest of appetites (like myself) , you will leave here stuffed! Two, the service is outstanding, extremely professional and they don't use \"teenie boppers\" (kids) to wait tables that are not familiar with the culture, dishes etc.The restaurant is extremely  beautiful and filled with paintings and music of the Persian culture. If you walked in you would think you would need deep pockets but the prices are extremely reasonable and affordable for both lunch and dinner. 

My favorite food is the Kefta or known in Iran as Kabob Koobideh with half rice and half salad with big chinks of feta cheese and a really good house dressing. The basmati rice is cooked to perfection and is always an excellent accompany to the meat. This place is perfect for a date to introduce people to the Persian cultured food, work lunches or dinners or family. Either way you will leave satisfied, very full and plenty of money still left in your pocket!"}

{"text":"i have been visiting this restaurant since i moved to AZ. it was very delicious at first, but the quality started to drop down a lot with time. lately, they were always been serving me an almost frozen food especially lamb shank. lightly warmed up, and very cold from inside. 
i was very disappointed and frustrated. also, what really bugged me was that i talked to the manager about this issue and i proved that to him, but he did not show any type of courtesy such as 10-15% off for their low quality food. NOT EVEN A SMALL DISH of desserts."}
{"text":"Wow ... just, wow! I couldn't have been happier with my experience at Persian Room. The service, the food, the wine selection, the ambiance, everything was pretty much perfect.

And it's a good thing too, because my first visit was to take my mom out for her birthday. She loves Middle Eastern food and is gluten intolerant, so the meat and/or veggie kabobs and rice-focused menu was perfect for her (and my vegetarian sister who was also with us). It is really hard to find a restaurant that appeals to people with varying dietary needs/choices and this one suited us perfectly.

I had first heard about the restaurant when it was briefly profiled on PBS. The food sounded fantastic and the space looked gorgeous! More on the traditional-fancy side, it offers a grand staircase in the middle of the room that goes up to the bar area. The first floor has a few booths and several tables (which were almost all taken at 6p on a Sunday, with large families and older couples). 

Our stellar service started when we were asked if we wanted a table or a booth. So simple, but a great gesture to ensure your clients are most comfortable. Our server was excellent about offering suggestions and explaining items when I told her I was pretty unfamiliar with the food on their menu. She offered the info that their (enormous) entrees are very flexible - if one comes with two chicken kabobs, you can ask for one chicken and one koobideh, and you can halve your side of rice (it's huge) and fill that in with a Greek salad. Fantastic, though it meant we took another 10 minutes putting together our order. 

I ended up with the koobideh kabob (ground beef mixed with garlic and onion and spices) and the polo rice, it was great. Mom got the filet kabob (replacing 1 of the 2 with a chicken kabob) and traded out the regular basmati rice with a specialty rice that included raisins and dates. Sister went veggie kabob and a side of the same specialty rice. None of us had a single complaint. Pita bread was fresh and delicious, cucumber/yogurt dip was tart and refreshing.

We had given our mom her bday card at the table, and when the server came by to clear our plates, she asked if it was a bday celebration and offered their Persian ice cream (vanilla ice cream with rose water, pistachios and honey). Seriously, was she great or what? We said of course and baklava for sister and I to share also. The ice cream came out with a candle and syrup \"Happy Birthday\" and our baklava came out sliced in half for us. I know, it's small stuff but it all added up and just impressed us again and again. (You better try that Persian ice cream if you go, it is incredible).

One last awesome move on the server's part - when she saw us dividing up the leftover pita in out to-go boxes, she offered more of their \"good bread\" (that they don't start serving until later in the evening) that was fresh out of the oven. She brought us out a stack of it wrapped and ready to go.

I repeat: Wow.

p.s. I have to admit I immediately get on the offense when I go to a restaurant that doesn't have an entrée below $13 on the menu. I get very \"who do they think they are?\" Then I'm like a hawk for all they ways they fall short of their price-prohibitive ways. And this place blew me away, worth every penny by way of portion sizes, service, quality and atmosphere.  To give you an idea (I always like knowing costs of stuff before I commit - champagne taste, champagne of beers budget, you see), we ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer dip, a small Greek salad, three entrees and one dessert, and the total was just over $100.

p.p.s. I don't call myself Lauren \"Longest Reviews Ever\" V. for nuthin'"}
{"text":"Excellent food, love the Onion and hot bread with butter they bring out, i usually dip it in hummus...usually i order the Barg Which is really tender filet Mignon- this plate alone can feed 2 people..nice decor and great service."}
{"text":"It was a hot day and we had been sightseeing for some time before we went to the restaurant. Walking in, the glass doors were an interesting architectural detail,and  the restaurant itself was bathed in low light with few patrons. It was early for dinner (we had been advised that reservations were not needed for the time we were considering and they were right).
Upon sitting down a basked of freshly baked flat bread and a dish of cilantro, parsley, basil and mint together with sliced onion were put on the table. These were inhaled.
There were 4 of us and so we were able to sample several dishes. We ordered 2 appetizers: humus and Tah dig with ghormeh sabzy, which is one their stews. The crunchy rice flat (Tah dig) was well executed and was served with a very tasty stew of beef pieces, beans and herbs. It could easily be an entree as it is quite generous. I had been eying that stew, but did not get it as I was already sampling it. Then we ordered: fessenjan, lamb koobideh, vegetable kebab, and substituted for the rice adas polo, sabzi polo and shirazi salad. The food was excellent, well seasoned, good presentation, but way too much. I sampled all the dishes and, although I had ordered the lamb I would have been quite happy with the fessenjan which had just the right sweet sour mix. I did not eat my \"plain\" rice, but shared the sabzi polo ordered by one of our party. 
All in all I would definitely go back, order less food as the portions were huge and that might allow room to sample some desert."}
{"text":"You definitely won't go hungry here!! The atmosphere was nice. The people were even nicer. It can be casual but you might want to put on something a little more special to dine here, plus it makes you feel good to dress up. The food was outstanding! The value to portion ratio at dinner is insane, I suggest fasting before eating here. You will get two large meals out of it. I was so hoping to try dessert after Yelps recommendations but I will have to control myself next time to fit that in. The bread is delivered to your table shortly after coming out of the oven & is warm & delicious. There were a few large groups that had laughter oozing from the tables which made it a fun experience. We can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Love the decor and ambiance as you walk in.  We were seated upstairs and it seemed a bit quieter than the packed main dining room.  The grand staircase up to the second level is quite a statement piece for the room.  The food was fantastic, and the portions were huge.  I apologize for not remembering the dish names.  Appetizer was braised meats over crispy rice.  Braised lamb was succulent and full of flavors.  Traditional kebab and grilled meat and vegetables were amazing....served with saffron rice of course.  Cocktails were a bit strong, but hey I guess that's better than watered down.  Planning on coming back for lunch."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner one night during the week. We started off with a few appetizers including the ta diq (sp?). It was so delicious; I've never had anything like it! Everyone's entrees were huge and delicious. Can't wait for my leftovers!"}
{"text":"I enjoy good Persian food. This place is good.  Cherry Rice misses the mark, but everything else is tasty. Very affordable too."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food! The best is the yogurt dip, dolmades, and the non-carbonated Duke with mint (yogurt drink). Plus kubideh and chicken kebab is awesoeme."}
{"text":"Good food and nice ambiance. Pitas are made fresh there and soft. I have chicken dish here it was yummy and enough for one person."}
{"text":"Best Koobideh in town! We've been coming here for years for my mom's birthday. You get what you pay for. I usually can't finish my entree and have some to take home. Definitely the place to try if you haven't had Persian food!"}
{"text":"MARANA/TUCSON LOCATION: I'm adding this only for this specific location since there is no yelp set up for this new location yet. However I'm told it is the same owner. 

Here goes.... we had GREAT service, hence the review is not about service. The young man was very knowledgeable about the menu especially since we are vegan. We love Persian food. But the vegan concoction that sounded so amazing on the menu was literally the worst thing I've ever smelled or tasted. The description of eggplant with okra and mint, in a subtle tomato sauce with herbs sounded like heaven come to earth. Well. This was horrible. They forgot to mention the dehydrated and rotten limes they put in the sauce to rehydrate and the horrid smell thy should only be smelled coming out of the restroom. 

No chef should ever send something out that s/he hasn't first tasted and smelled. If it smells like dirty ass, and tasted like I'd imagine dirty ass would taste, well... as they say, it's probably dirty ass. 

This place needs their chef to have cooking lessons in not just vegan food but food that shouldn't smell or taste like ass."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times now.
Very good service, and the food is amazing. It's a little bit on the pricy side but you get big portion as well.
We've had mixed platter and chicken and beef kabob along with rice and grilled tomatoes.
It's a huge place so it gets a little noisy and there are a lot of people around but still not bad a place. If you are looking for a quiet place may be you can ask them to get you a table on the side."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, wish I could say the same of the food. The food didn't have enough salt or spice, and generally did not meet our expectations."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here regularly  since we moved to Scottsdale 10 years ago. It was one of the first things we fell in love with when we moved here. The service and decor are first class. We just love the feel of a high end Persian restaurant. 

Of course the most important thing is the food and it lives up to the requirement and beyond. We always have left overs and they call to me from my refrigerator all night.

This is hands down my favorite restaurant in town"}
{"text":"A group of 7 woman chose to dine at the Persian room.  We came from all over the valley, from Goodyear, from Chandler, etc.  How excited we were.  We all had heard such wonderful comments about the restaurant.  We went on an Saturday night, reservations at 6. Assumingly, their busiest night, so they should have been well prepared.  What a horrendous experience we had.  It started off well.  But we noticed right away the service was slow.  When I was finally able to flag someone down to take my drink order, I was informed they could not make a mojito as they did not have any mine.  No mint?  A middle eastern restaurant without mint? They tried to push their signature drink on me, but I was not interested.  I had already been informed the drink was overly sweet.  Fine, I just stuck with water.  Another attendee ordered a Pear Martini that she had to send back as it tasted like cough syrup.  She ended up with one of their signature drinks.  Dinners were ordered.  For $17.00 I received a large plate with 3/4 of it rice and what looked like one skewer of chicken.  Looking around, the plates of the other attendees looks pretty much the same, a small portion of meat and 3/4 of rice.  The entire time we were there [approx. 3 hours] not once were our water glasses refilled.   Not once did the waitress come over and asked how everything was, did we need anything.  Not once.  After dinner, the dinner plates took an extremely long time to be removed and not all the plates were removed.  Two of the woman ordered the Persian Pastry, only to be informed by the waitress they were all out of it.  Did the woman want something else?  One woman ordered baklava and the other ordered another item off the menu.  What she received was not what she ordered on the menu, but instead another item was brought out, having been told once again, the second dessert she ordered was not available either.  Two of us women decided to order an after dinner coffee, with a shot of Kahlua and whipped cream. They were brought out iced, and in a whiskey glass.  What?  I informed the waiter I wanted hot coffee.  Got my hot coffee, luke warm, and again in a whiskey glass.  Really?  I wanted a cup of coffee, and I get it in a whiskey glass?  Another woman at the table just wanted a cup of regular coffee and it took the waitress over 15 minutes to bring her the coffee.  What, did they have to pick and grind the beans?.  Meanwhile, dirty dinner plates remained on the table.  Finally, we all had enough.  Once of the woman took charge after the waitress was bringing by the checks.  She wanted to speak with the manager.  During the 1/2 hour, many discussions took place, whereas the manager was very condescending. [Makes you wonder if that is how he speaks with his customers in general, or just us because we were woman]. They were understaffed that night.  It's a Saturday night.  It is the restaurant's responsibility to make sure they are staff and the customers are attended to.  He offered to give a $30 dollar gift card for us to come back.  Come back?  That was laughable.  We are never coming back and cannot wait to tell our experience to our friends.  The manager then comes over with the two desserts that were initially ordered?  Where were these the first time around?  Oh, the waitress did not know that they did in fact have the desserts.  Would we like them know? No!  What we want is our check and some compensation for our horrible experience.  \"We could box up the desserts and you can take them home\".  
What part of no did he not understand.  After much insistence he did comp some of each of our checks, but the full gratuity was left on.  No way.  We were not leaving a full tip.  The woman was a horrendous waitress and full tips were not given.  Never ever ever going back!!  The show Mystery Diners would have had a field day with this one."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Persian food in the area. The beef barq is my favorite but have been here several times and all of the dishes are amazing! The only thing I dislike about this restaurant is the environment. The decor is very over the top and the servers have acted snobby each time. Food is overpriced, but still so delicious."}
{"text":"I came here last week for dinner wanting to like this place so much, but it didn't turn out being that way.  What I will say positively about this place is the ambiance, decor and service.  I could not complain about any of those things.  
   
   My friend and I began with the pita bread which was actually quite delicious.  Then we had the dolmades.  Those were good as well.  So far the meal seemed as though it was going to be promising.  My friend ordered the lamb shanks.  Two size able shanks in a bath of bland broth.  The rice that came with it wasn't great, but it was a hell of a lot better than the rice I received.  I ordered the lamb koobideh.  Ground, skewered, broiled lamb that tasted like typical frozen breakfast sausage that you find at any supermarket.  This was served with Basmati rice that was just blah.
   
   Based on my experience here with mediocre entrees I have no desire to go back again.  I should stick with Gordon Ramsay's advice.  If a restaurant has pictures of their food on the menu, run!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for almost 2 years and last week i was very disappointed by their Hummus serving. They are charging the same amount $$ for half of the serving. How cheap is that!!"}
{"text":"We stayed home in Scottsdale for a week and went to the Persian Room TWICE! The food is pricey but very good. Our waiter, Raheem, was so good that we requested him for the second time as well. If you go to Scottsdale, you must go to the Persian Room."}
{"text":"Wow. Beautiful, elegant, and most of all, delicious. Friendly staff excellent middle East food / Persian / Iranian. The nann speaks for itself"}
{"text":"Holy Moly this place is good... My only advice is to order a dish to split and maybe and appetizer. The portions are huge. Service is wonderful. Seating area is beautiful and the fresh baked bread is unbelievable."}
{"text":"Eric peek the nigh manager, was so roude and he yell at us and yelled at the our servant, the food was good and our servant was so good but i didn't like how he treated us and i didn't his like attitude, the problem was about 8 dollars because we were there we figured we use our group on coupon later we meet friends so we decided to join the tables, we paid on saperate checks look like they had a coupon as well and the server already redeemed it, he made a big deal about it, we told him we just joined the table we didn't know that we can use one per table and still we paid separately so its not like 2 coupons on the same bill, anyway he could've just told us nicely and dealt with it more professionally and wait for us to leave, i like to come back but not with this customer service, our bill was 120$  and their bill was about the same so 8 dollars is that big to tell us we are loosing money here and was so furious about it."}
{"text":"Bad service , bad food. My waiter got my order wrong then insisted on making me a new order for the mistake. 
As I was walking to car the box felt lite so i decided to see what was inside and these guys couldn't even give me rice. Just chicken. Couldn't get my order correct the first time then can't give me rice with my food? Rice must cost as much as gold I guess. Never coming back."}
{"text":"We had a reservation at Persian Room at 6pm. The food was good but The service!!!

The waiter was all over the place. My mother in law ordered tea..20 min later with an another request she got it. My food and my friends food never arrived when I mentioned to the waiter he made it look like it's our fault. And start asking what did I ordered. We got our food 40 min later then all people at the table.  

People had to get up and go serve water themselves. I asked for sugar 2 times...unsuccessful ! 
We wanted to order a desert for my brother in law birthday but after 3 hours of waiting and horrible service we desired it's not a good idea. 

To the owner/manager DONT BE CHEAP and hire more servers. I know for sure we are not coming back!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is very formal, usually packed on weekend nights. Have a reservation, definitely. The food here is AMAZING! Try hummus, DA BOMB DOT COM. Okay, maybe I'm getting a little ahead of myself. For an entrée, I usually order the Cornish hen, which comes with saffron rice and roasted tomatoes. The portions are pretty big, so if you have a child with you, I recommend that you share because the plates are huge. The waiters are kind and there's a place where you can watch a chef making the pita bread. Show your kids. Happy dining!"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and elegant decor. The parking lot is extremely small for such a large size restaurant. I was lucky enough to find a spot but the person I was meeting had to park near a nearby village inn. I also saw people walk from nearby hotel parking lots. The food was good and the portions were huge. The mixed drinks were perfect. The waitress didn't write things down and forgot about the appetizer but once it was brought to their attention, it was brought out immediately. The people in the restaurant were helpful and polite asking if we needed more drinks and water etc through out the evening. This is definitely a place to make reservations because when I got up at one point I did see quite a bit of people waiting. ( we had reservations for a Saturday night) now as far as what to wear .. Anything goes! Love it! This restaurant reminds me of fine dining in Los Angeles because people wore whatever they wanted. I was wearing jeans, blouse and heels and blended just fine... There were people in polo shirts and shorts, suits and dresses and people who wore athletic clothing. It's definitely a nice restaurant and deserves to be dressed up nicely for as your sitting in an elegant setting. However, it was my first time going and I had no idea what to wear. I would recommend this restaurant to others, the food, service and overall experience was great!"}
{"text":"Large portions, nice people. I recommend the streak and chicken with-rice more than the pasta. Love the all you can eat bread with fresh herbs."}
{"text":"Excellent, lunch or dinner. Atmosphere is suitable for either - classy. Not terribly expensive. Food is delicious, and not your standard fare. Kubideh's my personal favorite, but the chicken dishes are great as well.
I'll continue to go back."}
{"text":"I am probably biased when I review Persian Room. We've always gone in a large group and the service is usually incredibly slow (not sure by chance or purely because of service). The food is hit and miss.. the portions are pretty sizeable. I wouldn't call it the greatest place for vegetarians.. Those food options are not good.

My favorites: 
1. Persian room appetizer platter: Combination of dolmeh, hummus & eggplant, yogurt & cucumber dip, and torshi.
2. Chicken Barg
3. Chicken Kebab"}
{"text":"I love the food! My favorite is the chicken kebab, it's juicy and delicious.  You gotta try this place, it's casual to fine dining, you see it all. 
I suggest starting with the hummus then and entrée of your choice (can't go wrong with anything) and ending it with he ice cream! 
The bread alone is fantastic, I love it with the basil they bring with it. The house hot tea is delicious as well. 
Today our service sucked but I'm assuming she was new. Any other time the service is good."}
{"text":"I have been to the restaurant a number of times.  The food is always wonderful!  The portion sizes are very generous.  For example, if a combo platters *says* it feeds two people, it will really feed 4...  I have been here with friends that hail from the middle east who vouch for the foods authenticity  as well.

Their service is really excellent also.  For example, today I ordered take out.  It was ready *exactly* on time and they even took the time to show me everything I had ordered before I left so that there was no doubt they had gotten my order right (they had it perfect!)  Now that's good service and attention to detail!

Looking for something different?  Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere, and it's a must visit every time I travel to Scottsdale. The people who greet you are warm and engaging. I've always been seated quickly, even when the place is jam packed. The decor is very nice and smartly themed. I could eat this type of food every day and be very, very happy. Everything I've ever had here has been absolutely delicious. The wine list is impressive and reasonably priced. The hummus is of course outstanding. But the star for me is the Sultani dinner (filet/koobideh combo). The filet is soft and absolutely rich with flavor. I always get the lamb koobideh and it is the best I've ever had. The portions here are huge, including the large amount of delicious rice that comes on the side. I can't recommend this place highly enough!"}
{"text":"being persian and living a hour away from persian food is so hard - love going here ! great food and atmosphere"}
{"text":"I don't know why I don't come here more often.  They have a pretty good deal for happy hour.  Our last visit was for our International Super Club night.  I ended up coveting the dishes around me.  My hubby had the fesenjan, and it was really good.  He called it a persian mole.  Monica had a grilled chicken dish that looked delicious.  The tahdig was so yummy with all the hummus and baba ganoush.  I think their happy hour is until 8p.m. and they offer specials upstair on their drinks and appetizers.  I guess I need to make another trip to the Persian Room very soon."}
{"text":"I've been to Persian Room 10+ times and I can say that the food here is great, the portions are even better, and the ambience is nice for celebratory occasions. However, while this place has its upsides, it also has its downfalls. 

1. The Beef Koobideh is outstanding and will melt in your mouth. The Chicken Sultani is also incredible, if you're looking to eat chicken and not beef. I'm not a fan of beef, but I still get the Beef Koobideh every time. It's THAT good. However, they lack consistency in the flavor of their food. While it's always good, there are some days where the food tastes (much) better. 

2. Do not come for the service. I've had good service at Persian Room I think just twice. The waiters don't come to check on you, sometimes you have to remind them to get you water, you have to flag them down to get the bread + basil and onion plate (which is provided as an appetizer and probably the best part of the whole meal), you have to try and ask any server that passes you for to-go boxes, you have to ask them to get the check, etc. They are usually crowded, which could explain the poor service, but I've also had poor service during the off-peak hours I have been here. 

Coming during non-peak hours is your best bet. I'll probably be back and I definitely do recommend this place, but your dining experience might not be all-around perfect."}
{"text":"Arizona has let me down when it comes to American food. I've decided to try Persian because in Houston there's so many delicious places I love. My favorite place in Houston is called Kasra and I was hoping it would be like that.


The place is definitely grand with all the chandlers' and beautiful décor. I was excited because this place was packed on a Wednesday night with Persians and Middle Eastern people. I was thinking this must be the hot spot!

I ordered hummus and filet beef hoping it would be flavorful and delicious. The hummus with eggplant dish was chucky and cold and I can't taste a thing as far as eggplant and seasoning. It was extra calories wasted. This dish would of been better if they had garlic mixed with it. The herbs that came with it was all wet.... Real Persian place would make sure it's spun dry or else the bread will be soggy.

When my dish came out it looked great like in the pictures but I was disappointed again with Arizona food.. The beef was not the best quality and wasn't cooked to my liking. The seasoning was off and it tasted like dry grilled beef. 


I would not recommend this place to anyone who had good Persian/ Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"I'm a loyal follower of Anthony Bourdain.  From his best selling book Kitchen Confidential, to his early TV career on the popular Travel Channel show No Reservations, to his current gig as host of the CNN hit show Parts Unknown.  Yeah, Bourdain can be a jackass & a blowhard sometimes, but when it comes to exploring food culture in all corners of the world, there are few better at telling that story better than Bourdain.  Such was the case on his Parts Unknown visit to Iran a few years ago.  With so few Americans having set foot in Iran, it was fascinating to see his interactions with local Iranians & to get a glimpse of the food culture that permeates both at Iranian restaurants & in Iranian homes.  It was a haunting, controversial, & beautifully complicated episode that's worth your viewing time if you ever get the chance.  The takeaways I got from the show were that regular Iranian citizens aren't that much different from you & me, & that Iran's food culture is one I'd REALLY like to explore further.

Tonight was actually my second visit to Persian Room since viewing that Parts Unknown episode.  My Aunt brought me here the first time as she herself is one of the few Americans who has spent an appreciable amount of time in Iran.  According to her, Persian Room is about as close to authentic Iranian food as you can get in the valley.  I remember sharing a stew & some kabobs with her here & really enjoying it.  Tonight for my second trip I joined my wonderful fellow Yelpers for the monthly International Supper Club UYE event.  Big thanks to Monica as always for putting this monthly event together, & a huge thanks for choosing Persian Room as our goto spot this month.

Persian Room is an elegant, but relatively relaxed restaurant with Persian decor & artwork from floor to ceiling as well as a couple of a giant chandeliers to match.  Its actually a two story operation with the majority of the sit down restaurant on the ground floor and the bar area with additional seating upstairs.  For our large Yelp group, we got a table upstairs right next to the bar.  The restaurant can cram well over 100 here on a busy night (emphasis on cram as the tables & chairs can be a tight squeeze in places).  The first thing they'll put in front of you is butter, basil, raw onion, & a bowl of Iranian bread called Sangak.  Trust me when I say this is a starter not to be taken for granted.  Grab a piece of warm sangak, spread a little butter on it, put some basil leafs and onion in there, roll it up & munch away.  Its a delicious & surprisingly refreshing snack to start your meal.

As we were here with a large group tonight, I lobbied to see if I could get two other Yelpers to go in for Persian Room's largest most sharable dish.  That would be the Tour of Persia.  The specs on this monstrosity: humungous kabobs of ground beef, cornish game hen, filet mignon, & two kinds of rice (Basmati & Barberry).  Plus a side of their Gheimeh Bademjan stew.  When they say it serves three they mean it.  Fortunately, I found a couple willing to go down the rabbit hole with me on this one.

The stew contains sautéed beef, sautéed eggplant, yellow split peas, tomato sauce, onions, & lime.  The broth in the stew was pretty flavorful & I liked the texture of the peas.  The only thing I actually wasn't too crazy about were the beef cuts.  A little too fatty in spots actually.  Now for the platter.  Let me first say the two rice selections were phenomenal.  It's said no one does rice like Iranians do, and they aren't kidding.  The Basmati rice is long slender white rice topped with saffron, while the Barberry rice (known in Iran as Zereshk Polow) is long grain rice mixed with saffron and barberries (which taste like dried sour cherries).  I could've eaten both of those piles of rice until I was sick.  The filet mignon & ground beef kabobs were both fantastically seasoned, ridiculously tender & flat out delicious.  The cornish game hen was also tasty, though I'll admit I probably would've preferred their chicken as the hen simply didn't have as much meat on the bone as I would've liked.

The Tour of Persia costs about $60 when you include tax & tip, so between the three of us it was $20/person.  Considering the amount of food & the qualify and creativity of the food, it was a pretty good value.  Not everything on the platter was perfect, but the piles of rice & beef kabobs alone were worth the effort.  If you're looking for good individual dishes, my favorite is probably the Naderi Sultani.  Almost a miniature version of the Tour of Persia with a combination of chicken, filet mignon & beef kabobs with basmati rice.  That personal sized dish will set you back about $30 including tax & tip.  The majority of dishes here are closer to $20 in price so you don't have to go all out like we did to have a good meal.  Persian Room may just be a glimpse into the complex & fascinating aspects of Iranian cuisine.  But my what a delicious glimpse it is."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional.   My friend had grape leaves which were not great.  The rest of the group had various chicken dishes which were superb.  The baklava is the best I have ever had.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place for both food and atmosphere.  It's a great place to share dishes with friends.  The servings are generous so everyone can get a taste of something different."}
{"text":"I love this place! For appetizers the kash ke bademjoon, mastkhiyar is amazing! Love that they have wine specials on sundays . I recommend the lamb koobideh and the mahicheh lamb with baghali polo. The chicken kabob can be better and the gheyme stew wasn't that great! Overall love the food and staff is great and the owner is very friendly and helpful anytime I have interacted with him! They also do pickups so we always order koobideh to go!"}
{"text":"The best Persian Kabobs I ate in many states that I have visited. Very tasty and fresh marinated Kabobs sided with saffron basmati rice is highly recommended! Dont forget to try the crispy rice with two stews as an appetizer!"}
{"text":"I have been returning to this restaurant for a littler over 10 years.  The quality is excellent and the food taste is consistent. Waiting staff is attentive and prompt enough.  The portions are large and one dish can be easily split for 2 people, or have enough for doggie-bag for another feast.

The noise level is rather loud, but then there are multitude of diners especially during meal rush hours. This is not a place for impressing someone for the first meeting. The establishment is perfect for family style dining and large group banquets. 

They actually make their own pita bread on the spot and the taste is phenomenal. My favorite is either Chicken & Fillet Sultanni, or Rack of Lamb. I do like to finish off my meal with their Turkish Coffee and it too is excellent.

Price is on the higher side, but the value couldn't be better."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. You can never go wrong ending up at Persian room when deciding where to dine. Their complimentary bread and butter is just the icing on the cake. I definitely recommend Persian food to anyone and everyone who is looking to try some Persian/Middle eastern food. The customer service is decent, the staff is friendly as well. I love dining there."}
{"text":"The Persian Room serves a standard middle eastern food menu, in a nice, upscale setting.   That being said, I have had better food at fast food joints (Pita-whatever) in Chicago.  The best thing about this place is probably the decor.  It makes for a nice place to take someone you are trying to impress.   However, the food is not spectacular.  I had the beef kabob plate, which I found to be a little overcooked (too long, over too low heat).  My friend's chicken kabob was well prepared, but nothing spectacular.   The portions were generous, and we could have easily gotten by with just one entree.  The hummus w/ eggplant was very good as an appetizer.

Overall, a nice setting for a restaurant and decent food, however you can probably find better middle-eastern food at 1/2 the price."}
{"text":"Nasty! Nasty! Nasty! The worst birthday of my life! Went to the Persian room and order a veggie dish from the vegetarian menu and it was so disgusting I almost three up! The smell was intoxicating! If you are a vegetarian please go else where this place is gross!"}
{"text":"Yum!  I have driven by this place so many times and finally met a coworker here for lunch last month.  The decor is a little dated, but still nice.  We were welcomed by the staff and the service was excellent.  The prices were really reasonable, the portions were generous and the food was absolutely delicious.  The beef kabob was moist and flavorful and served with everything I like.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place.. wish they had grilled jalapeños which should be a standard in Persian restaurants.. nevertheless I'll be coming back many times for sure.. TV and bar upstairs if you're dining alone"}
{"text":"The only time I've had Persian food was when our friends who are from Paris and Iran had dinner parties. I was so impressed with this place. The food was presented just as beautifully as my friends did it and the taste was amazing. I had the white dish and it was cooked perfectly and the rice, WOW!"}
{"text":"The kabob and food is ok, but they add food fillers and additives which makes you bloated and nauseated. Furthermore, they are a rip off restaurant. A group of us decided to eat here and they quoted us a fixed price for the buffett, soft drinks and deserts.  However, when they brought the bill they added extra price for soft drinks and we did not get any deserts as promised.  I would never go back to this establishment and would take my bussiness elsewhere with higher quality foods and honest service."}
{"text":"An opportunity appeared for me to give Persian room another try. This time around they impressed me with their gigantic meat platters. I don't recall what I ate, but the meat was cooked perfectly and the bread was amazing as usual. After this experience I would come back for round 3."}
{"text":"I finally got the chance to go here this past weekend. When you first walk in there is a lot to take in from the grand staircase, to the chandeliers, to the noise level. It's all a little over the top yet I enjoyed it. We arrived about 15 minutes early for our reservation and were seated within minutes. We sat and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited some more. They brought us water, and pita but no one ever came by to get our order. We watched other diners be seated after us get their food and we were still waiting for someone to take our order. We asked a busser for assistance and then we asked the hostess for assistance. The manager finally came over and apologized and made sure we were taken care of right away after waiting close to 45 minutes. Apparently there was some confusion as to who was covering our table. He did his best to make it right by offering us appetizers or drinks for the inconvenience but after seeing the huge portions come out we passed knowing we would never finish our meals. I really did appreciate him trying to fix the situation. After ordering our meals arrived in a timely fashion and were delicious. Sure, we were starving and would have eaten anything (except the raw onion the put on the table) but the food was still very good. The diners at my table had a variety of items from chicken barg to beef kabobs and I tasted it all. The meats were flavorful and tender and the rice was cooked perfectly. The portions are huge!

The service started out very rocky but they came through in the end and we will certainly give them another chance."}
{"text":"After 2 fantastic visits to the Persian Room, I feel very good about giving 5 stars on this imaginative place.  

There are lots of appetizer options but if you don't get the eggplant hummus you are missing out on a slice of heaven that no one knew existed. It is PERFECTION. Warm pita bread along with persian spices and fresh sweet onion make it just that much better. Seriously--you can eat this onion by the slice and not worry about bad breath. It's awesome.

We shared the #49 Persian Room platter is perfect for sharing and features some of the best choices on the menu. From the inventive koobideah, beef barq and the chicken filet served with delicious basmati rice, you just can't go wrong. I recommend asking for 1/2 rice, 1/2 Persian Room salad (which is basically a Greek style salad) as there is still more rice than you could possibly eat, even with a 1/2 size portion.

The first time we went, we ate upstairs by the bar, which was actually more interesting than the main dining room, mostly because you got a great view of the street and all that was going on. The second visit we were in the far larger overflow seating area, despite having had a reservation. It was packed both times with all walks of life visiting the restaurant. 

The service staff was excellent offering suggesting to new timers, even remembering names of those returning for new visits.  I always like when you can go to a  place and the people remember your name. :) 

Definitely try the Persian Room. Deliciousness in a genie bottle!"}
{"text":"I live right next to this place. The food never lets me down. My favorite is the chicken and the filet. I also cannot get enough of the hummus and the bread and the fresh onions and basil. The thing that brings this to a 3 star rating is the service is very mediocre. The wait staff seems to be very short, I remember the server didn't want to try to hold a conversation with me when we tried to get recommendations on what to order."}
{"text":"Exceptional Persian food.  This is an annual stop for us on our trip to Scottsdale.  We visited twice this visit.  We love the wait staff - especially Lucy and Michael."}
{"text":"We had a great meal here. The grilled meats were done very well.  I recommend the sampler appetizer.  The hummus/babbagnoush combo is also a hit!"}
{"text":"I want to commend them for accommodating our large party for my sisters Birthday! And our waiter (his name started with a B) and the manager for being awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always packed, yeah. Princess and Scottsdale thereabouts, easy access. Great hours. Impress your date, close to clubs, top ten for sure."}
{"text":"Very good Middle Eastern cuisine in a very posh establishment. Only took 12 years to try this place and am kicking myself for not coming sooner.

Best meal is the Persian appetizer platter ($14.95) - unlimited fresh pitas to sample each offering as well. I greatly enjoyed my lamb koobideh ($16.95) as did my girlfriend with her beef koobideh kebab ($13.95) but was not impressed with the sabzi polo ($6.99). I was expecting much more of a fresh dill flavor to the rice but it failed to meet my expectation. Perhaps I'm too much a novice to know good sabzi from bad, I don't know. I would have been further ahead to stick with those hot, crispy-chewy pitas and more dolmeh to go with more hummus.

Expensive for Mediterranean, but the ambiance is spectacular - so for a special night out impressing the ladies, this is a good choice if you're into trying a different cuisine other than steak or Italian."}
{"text":"We have been eating at the Persian room for over 10 years. One thing you can count on is consistency. 

We have tried almost every item on the menu and have not had any disappointment. 

The bread is very tasty and home made (after 6 and on weekends). The portions are huge. We ate the hummus appetizer many times. My favorite dish is the mahi mahi. Although I've eaten the chicken filet sultany just as much. Both are very tasty. 

The atmosphere is quiet and elegant. The interior looks like a much more expensive place."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites. I go here with my family about every other month. Tonight we went for mother's day dinner, and the food quality was still memorable, as always! 

My parents and I shared the Persian Room Special that is composed of filet mignon, chicken filet, and koobideh kabob served with basmati rice. This platter was enough to fill my parents and I until we were completely full. It's a nice platter since you get a taste of three of their most popular meats which are all seasoned to perfection. Not only are they juicy and tender meats, but the char on the meats made the flavor even stronger. The rice is light and non-sticky, which makes you feel fulfilled without having the heavy carb fill that most rice usually gives you. I never feel guilty eating here since the meats are grilled and the rice is steamed. 

My advice to others is to make a reservation, since it will make your wait very minimal upon arrival. Also, be ready to share food 'cause it's a lot of food! Lastly, try to carpool. There isn't much parking and this place is almost always crowded."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants! It's a great first date place! It's elegant yet casual. Food is delicious! I love the rice and their salmon. They have a variety of Persian favorites. They serve homemade bread with butter and basil leaves. The decor is fancy and relaxing."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner, and noticed Happy Hour sign in the front. Looked like they had some great specials on drinks and 1/2 off appetizers, for the seating area upstairs. Once we confirmed that regular menu items are served upstairs, we were sold. I actually preferred sitting away from the main area because it looked a lot less crowded and less noisy. We shared the appetizer platter which was a great deal at half off and was a great way to sample majority of their starters: dolmeh, hummus, yogurt dip, and torshi - all delicious. We decided to split an order of chicken breast kebab and koobideh. Their portions are more than generous. We were stuffed to the brim and still had a 1-person lunch leftover for tomorrow. To top it all off, the service was great! All in all, it was a great experience. We will return again and will make sure to come back during the Happy Hour times."}
{"text":"Delicious food with big plates! You are not going to leave this place unsatisfied. Stuff is very friendly, classy place!"}
{"text":"Eat like a king ! Best middle eastern food in Arizona ! Portions are huge , and they have the best hot tea to wash down all this goodness"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit to the Persian Room. Food & service was, as usual, excellent.  I had the Lamb Kabobs & my girlfriend had the Salomon.  The appetizers were great.  The Lamb was tender & juicy, seasoned just right with great flavor. Salmon & rice was excellent.  I would highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Fancy... better get a hot date. Too late for some of us :( hahaha
Food was great no doubt... couldn't find a fault with any of the Kebab options and bread was made fresh.
My only gripe is staff gets a little testy... patience patience."}
{"text":"Delicious Persian food in a beautiful environment with excellent service. I had the Chicken Shish with basmati rice and salad with tzaziki. The hummus and pita bread were incredible and the baklava was the best I've ever had - butter honey with nuts and layers of phylo dough. Amazing experience! And they have a lunch menu with HUGE PORTIONS!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here because an acquaintance told me about it and I scored a Groupon. The portions are huge, so come hungry! Our service was very nice and attentive. We ordered the vegetable rice, whice was very tasty and grilled skewered chicken (koobideh) was very flavorful. I wasn't impressed with the saffron rice that comes with the entree. It was a bit dry and didn't pair well with the grilled meat (I know that's the traditional way). I'd prefer just having hummus and pita with it or I'll fork over the extra money for the salad. Overall, great place to have a family lunch or dinner. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in the state.  The food is great and the service always good.   The Barg, filet Mignon, is so tender you could use a spoon to cut it.  The rice is the best you will find in the US.  

Dolmeh's are a favorite appetizer."}
{"text":"I came here twice once back when it first opened and recently when I was in town. The restaurant is beautiful the staff is very nice and attentive, however the reason why I am giving it 4 stars is because the portions seemed small for the price we came with friends and they always go there they even said the portions seemed a lot smaller, wish they were bigger cause the food sure was good."}
{"text":"Poor service.. the meat served was bland.. expensive not so tasty pus small quantity sums up our dissatisfaction level here..
Would not recommend anything here except Hummus and Pita bread (some $7)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Persian restaurant, and I have been coming for years. If you have a large party, I would make a reservation. My husband and I were able to be seated within minutes when we came on a Saturday night, but the bigger parties had to wait. The decor is beautiful. They also make homemade pita bread. I like that there are also vegetarian and vegan options. Portion sizes are large, so either share or request a box for leftovers."}
{"text":"First time in the city and this place has amazing kabobs. We got the combination plate that feeds two. Great value and a lot of fun. The quality of food is spot on. From a born Persian, get the yogurt cucumber sauce to mix with any dish you get."}
{"text":"I have been here many times. Service is great and the food is delicious.  We usually buy the combination platters for the whole family and the different meats (chicken, beef) are surprisingly tender. We usually order the hummus which is also very good."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I ordered chicken shish. The meat was marinated and grilled to perfection. The Rice, salad with yogurt, pita bread with herbs and butter...all were flavorful. My waitress Lucy was very attentive making the dining experience even more enjoyable."}
{"text":"We enjoy the eggplant hummus and vegetarian rice dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place me and my family go all the time and the food is delicious. We have never had any problems with the food they have cooked or anything. The waiters are wonderful. We even had my little sisters communion party there as well as my cousins a while back. It's a great atmosphere and wonderful decoration and decor. The prices are also reasonable for the amount of food you get. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"FAVORITE RESTURANT! If you ever ask me if I could pick anywhere to eat, this is my number one pick. For a man its heaven and pretty much all you can eat. I always get #34 Naderi sultans and it is the best thing you will ever taste. Everything is fresh and the service in outstanding. For how busy it always is they never seem to miss a beat!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was awesome for a date night... SO the guy takes me here to 'switch it up', as he put it:-) I loved the decor... the atmosphere.. the arabic music.. A very good wine list... Loved the Chicken Shish.. and my date had the Lamb Shanks.. the pita is very yummy too:) Everything was great.. attentive service!"}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this restaurant from my sister and my brother-in-law. I was finally able to experience this magical place last year for the first time and just returned from there a couple of weeks ago. The food is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  Not only the quality but the quantity! They are ginormous  portions!  We usually have to take some food back to the hotel.  One of our favorite thing here is what they bring out in the beginning. Onions, basil and home made flat bread. We usually order humus with it. Yummm!  My mouth is watering already! This restaurant is probably our FAVORITE restaurant EVER . I know this is a pretty strong statement but it's true!  You'll have to experience it yourself!! The ambiance is very elegant and exquisite with friendly and courteous staff. Very reasonably priced also. You'll be pleasantly surprised when you get your bill. We usually eat here everyday when we're in town. Yes, it's that good....."}
{"text":"When I went in, there was a blond lady in front and she didn't even say Hi or Welcome.  The lady who served me was very nice, she was the only nice person and the food was too oily for me. Usually Persian Food has less oil. I like the decoration and the music."}
{"text":"I have never had Persian food before and this food was absolutely fabulous! You will not leave disappointed or hungry with all of the terrific taste treats. The chicken filet sultani had very subtle spices that blended very well with the koobideh. I look forward to stopping by again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time  I have family in town Persian Room is always a destination.  Go hungry because the portions are huge. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Pretty good kabob.  The chicken was tastier than the beef.  Decor was a little over the top, but worth the trip."}
{"text":"Finally someone in Scottsdale that knows how to make Hummus the right way. When you live in Dearborn MI where all the Arabic people live - you get spoiled. I know good Hummus and this is it! During happy hour its free!!"}
{"text":"They have a nice dining area but I have to say their food isn't up to par. I recommend The Big Fat Greek restraunt on tatum & shea"}
{"text":"Awesome food, high quality, large portions and great location. Kabobs are all great, you can't easily find such a great Koobideh anywhere esle."}
{"text":"Decided to check out the Persian Room and I am glad I did. The complimentary bread is served with butter, herbs (basil and cilantro) and a onion. This is an unbelievable combination that I didn't anticipate to work well together, but it did! 

For a starter, I tried the eggplant hummus which was tasty but could have done without. The main course of the Chicken Shish adding a side of the Greek salad. The flavors of the chicken were top notch and I highly recommend. Finished off the night with a Turkish coffee.

All in all, I had a great experience at the Persian Room and will return real soon!"}
{"text":"Man was the food delicious! Went there in May, arrived on busy Saturday event as two adult couples. Our friends made a reservation (good idea). Appetizer of flatbread yogurt sauce and fresh sliced onion was scrumptious. The kebabs with rice are amazing. Never tasted such aromatic rice, and recommend sour cherry. The minced lamb kebab did not disappoint. One of us got the fish, and the veggies were grilled perfectly. Nice lively atmosphere with lots of families with kids. Reasonable prices--and everyone took home a doggy bag. Dessert of tiramisu and \"Persian\" (rosewater) ice cream was superb. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"I've been to the Persian Room several times now. The first time was a friend's engagement party. Each time I've been there the food has been great! We've ordered Persian Room Special and  the Tour of Persia since I love sampling different things. The basmati rice that is served with each dish is fluffy and fragrant. My two favorites are the chicken filet and Koobideh. It's probably good that this place is not closer, I'd probably be there once a week if it was."}
{"text":"We we underdressed for this place, but they said it would be okay. Cordial and knowledgeable about all the ingredients. We had lots of questions and they had answers for us. They seem very proud of their cuisine and with good reason.  We returned later and bought some to go. This is a must visit place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here for dinner tonight with his uncle and wife. We reached just after my husband's uncle & when we sat down, the water and menus were already on the table. We took a few min to review the menu during which the waitress came to ask us if we'd like to order appetizers and drinks. We were OK with our water and we ordered kashk badimjan as an appetizer & placed our main dish orders. I ordered the beef koubideh and chicken Sultani with zerishk rice. 
By the time we finished eating the appetizer, our main dishes were served. The food looked good & the portion was huge! We started eating and.....I unfortunately was disappointed. The chicken was undercooked and not hot enough, it was just warm. The kabab looked as if it was reheated instead of cooked fresh and when I tasted it, it didn't taste that great and it was just warm too. The rice however tasted good. This is my 3rd time here. I've been to Persian Room twice before around May & possibly February of 2015 and the food was a bit better I could've given them 4 stars back then. My complain back then would have been that the lamb koubideh was too fatty hence my choice of beef koubideh today which was the exact opposite; too dry!
Other than the food, the service here was excellent and the ambience was beautiful and felt even more beautiful at night (the two times I was there, I was invited for lunch). 
I have tried many times to love this place like some members of the family do but I am yet to find a dish that I would fully enjoy there & even though I believe I have given the restaurant enough chances so far, I will probably give it another shot in the future."}
{"text":"I have lived in this area for years and always wondered what this place was like. As an avid middle eastern food junkie I finally was able to try it out for lunch. Upon entering this place you are greeted by a somewhat eccentric looking interior, which was surprising based on the look of the outside of the restaurant. As soon as we sat down we were served an odd plate consisting of half a raw onion, basil & cilantro, hard packaged butter and a bunch of pita bread. The pita was good, however I have no clue why anyone would eat raw onion with hard butter and pita bread. It may be a custom but it was a first for me in any middle eastern restaurant I have ever been to previously. For my main I ordered a chicken filet and koobideh dish. When the food arrived the platter was massive and could easily feed 2 people, and this was the lunch portion. The chicken filet was well cooked and the koobideh was ok but both lacked any seasoning and flavor and were overall very bland. The rice was also very dry with no taste. The salad served with the dish was also very basic and had what appeared to be ranch dressing on it. In my opinion the dish needed some sort of sauce etc as it was just so dry. Overall the food was a disappointment, especially given the high price, though it wouldn't matter if the food was actually good. There are many other cheaper and tastier options around, for example try any Middle eastern place in Tempe after eating here and you will see what I mean."}
{"text":"This is the BEST OF THE BEST I tried so many Persian food in Arizona and California I have yet to find a restaurant this good. Excellent"}
{"text":"From the building to the menu to the service everything was great. 
We ordered the appetizer platter to try everything and we could not stop, delicious. We also tried the lamb and  vegetables, cooked perfectly. 
It is a great place for a dress up date but also for a casual Sunday."}
{"text":"We loved the ambiance; lighting, music, decor, etc. It was lovely. 

The service was okay. We were told our servers would be Alex (and another woman I can't remember the name) but Alex disappeared after I ordered hot water for my coffee. 20 minutes later I asked the server from downstairs and got it within a couple of minutes.

As for the food, we were trying something new and some of what we ate was unfamiliar to us so it's harder to rate. 

Example: lamb. I took one bite and decided to pass. Just really slick and oily. The domeh was also a \"no\" as was the rice with dates, raisins and lentils. The beef tasted just like Salisbury steak which was surprising. 

What we loved was the chicken dishes and the hummus was the best I've ever tasted. 
We were given fresh warm pita to start off which was nice. 

It was a fun experience and something new."}
{"text":"Ahhhh, the Persian Room has the best hummus and fresh homemade Pita bread that we have ever had in all our travels across the world. My family loves all their dishes and it is on the top of our list of favorite eateries."}
{"text":"I was totally unimpressed by this place.  The decor furniture carpet is way out of date.  The flow of the restaurant is horrible with people standing everywhere waiting to eat.  The food was bland and did not have a lot of flavor and overpriced.  The service was slow and not very good and we were charged 18 percent for being in a group.  I would not recommend this place at all and to call it fine dining is a joke!!"}
{"text":"Prepare to dine like a SULTAN!  No really, the food here is awesome.  We had drinks, dinner and desert for under $65 and it was all very tasty. Best of all we had leftovers for the next day.  The plates are what fat people love! You may have to flag down a waiter or 2, but if you don't mind that sort of thing...which I don't, you'll be fine.  Don't let the bad reviews scare you off.  The food and atmosphere is way to good to not come here because someone didn't get their cosmo on time."}
{"text":"This is so unfortunate. We used to be a regular and god knows how much hundreds of dollars we spent bringing family and friends to this place. Our last 3 experience has been terrible. THE ONLY PLACE THAT IVE EVER HAD TO ARGUE WITH THE SERVER LUDA (i think her name) regarding hair in the yogurt. Her response was what am i supposed to just believe you since we have no one in out kitchen with that hair.? How rude the manager wasnt even helpful with that regard... thats just crazy..we ordered the Sultani and the quality has not been as it used to be. The rice was cold and stale rice. It has been a multiple times that we had poor experience in the past. Cold stew and ghormeh sabzi. Im very meticulous on customer service. I understand the quality of food at times can change but the service is important. We as consumers can be craZy at times but we can always appreciate nice smily customer service."}
{"text":"We always  enjoy our dinners at the Persian Room. Especially the pita bread and their appetizer platter. Every dinner choice we have ordered has been very good. Service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"Their Koobideh Kebab is world class!!! I have eaten Middle Eastern food all over North America ... food + atmoshere ... this place is tops!!!

Hint #1: if you're with a group ... order some platters and ask for it to be served \"family style\" ... than, watch your guests eyes light up when they see the enormous sized plates that arrive at your table.

Hint #2: I tipped the pita maker once to make me a heart shaped pita for my wife .... she was floored!!!"}
{"text":"I only give this four starts instead of five because there are other places you can get this kind of food that are equally delicious, yet cost much less. That being said, I'll reiterate that this place is delicious! Between the three of us, we tried kebobs of all meat styles. They were all delicious! The filet is worth the cost - so tender and delicious. The atmosphere is much different than the other kebob places in town - completely the only reason they get to charge as much as they do. It's beautiful and well cared-for."}
{"text":"We've lived in Scottsdale for 20 years, and this place is so close, we keep meaning to go, but never have. So we finally made it. I would have given it a 5, but my wife was slightly less impressed. Went there last night for her birthday, and had a wonderful time. The wait staff was that perfect blend of being attentive, without being intrusive. Our waitress, Olia (sp?), gave impeccable recommendations. The ambience was lovely. Nice spot for a romantic dinner, or for a family. My wife had lamb kebobs, which were cooked to perfection. Accompanying that she had a type of rice which had dates and figs in it (I didn't try that, since no matter how well it was done, I wouldn't have liked it). I had the beef kebobs, along with a side of \"loobia polo\", which is a beef and rice dish in a light tomato sauce. Never had anything like it, and could have had just that for my meal. Yum. My wife had the house chardonnay, which was nice, and I had a Turkish beer, which was very good, but not outstanding.  I'd rate it on par with Heineken, with a little bit more bite. On the side we also had a yogurt/garlic dip which was fantastic.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent!  The fresh Naan is the best we've had and it is always fresh!  We usually get the Filet Mignon & Koobideh plate combination and it's big enough to share with 2-3 people.  We've gone here with friends and everything they've orders was very good.  Definitely a place we always go back to and crave.  Wish there was a location closer to us in Gilbert.  We always go to Phoenicia Cafe in Gilbert, which is also a great place!"}
{"text":"Warmly greeted, quickly seated.  Service on the mark with Steven. Newbies to this food Steven explained how to eat it to best enjoy it. I would have not guessed to smash the well roasted tomato into the rice and then eat with the meat.  Got the Persian plate becasue we had read your reviews that we would have leftovers.  For a week!  Very well cooked and fresh.  Bread was replenished with hot pieces. People around us seemed to all be return diners and all ate and took home the leftovers. Value was good when you eat two meals off of one order.  Two of us over ordered food with 2 glasses of wine for 50$ and then lunch tommorrow. Fresh basil and onion served with the fresh bread.  
The only reason that last star was not given... make the platter too hot to hold and the plates too.  You can't eat all this food and it not get cool if the serving dishes are not red hot.
Thanks Yelpers for heading us this way."}
{"text":"Good hummus, I had the cornish hen which was pretty good. my husbands beef dish was unimpressive. the wait staff was wonderful. maybe we need to try an alternate dish next time."}
{"text":"Great price, nice ambiance, and delicious food. The chicken kabob was very tender and juicy. The meat platter is a must!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is OK. Portions are huge. It says fine dining but people come dressed in pajamas, shorts, crappy shirts. Making a reservation is useless. We waited for 40 minutes. We were told that reservations did not mean anything if there are people waiting. I would go back only of I am craving the kababs."}
{"text":"I had the lamb shanks.  They were good but nothing special.  Huge portions and the rice is excellent.  I'd go back but not anytime soon.  Not an entree on the entire menu with any heat.  That loses a star."}
{"text":"The Persian Room Special combo platter is absolutely amazing. Could have definitely fed 3-4 people. Loved their grilled chicken the most. Will go here again to try out more Persian food."}
{"text":"Great environment and great food. The bread is to die for! A bit pricey but its enough for two servings usually. Try the pistachio ice cream. That alone will keep you coming back for more."}
{"text":"I went here with friends and we tried the vegetarian stew and the vegetarian kebab. The stew was too sour and the lentils slightly undercooked. I would not recommend it. However, the kebab was quite good and their zarashk polo was fantastic. Among the appetizers dolmeh were some of the best I have had, but the hummus was ordinary."}
{"text":"When I think of delicious and filling comfort food, Persian Room is one of the first places that comes to mind. I have eaten here many times over the years and the experience has never been anything but exceptional. It's not cheap but not overall expensive and the portions served are enough for multiple meals.

I have had many different dishes but. A few of my favorites are:

1. The hummus and eggplant appetizer served withy their fresh made delicious flag bread.

2. Beef koobideh. My wife loves the chicken but I prefer the beef. It's a long piece of seasoned ground beef. Sounds boring but is absolutely amazing. I actually like it more then the filet skewer. Totally savory and mouth watering.

3. The chicken barg. Simple dish but they manage to make chicken breast juicy, flavorful, and perfect. I don't often order chicken at restaurants but I crave this stuff.

The nice part about this place is you can order combos of pretty much anything. Again, the portions are huge so we always end up having leftovers. 

Makes my mouth water just thinking about it..."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect, never having eaten at a Persian restaurant before.  But my husband and I were out without the kids and wanted to try something new.
The ambiance is great.  Very loud with the talking and eating-wish there'd been some music playing but you could tell all the diners were having alot of fun.
We had reservations, they got us right in.
Service was great, our particular service was fantastic.  Very informative and helpful.
The food was AMAZING.  You start with na'an and a little plate of basil and onions.  Of course we did not know what to do with these but the idea is to make a little taco.  We had to ask our service how to do it and he very happily obliged :)
We didn't order any appetizers as it was just the 2 of us but I'd like to return with a group and get the big sample platter.  For the main course we ordered a combo platter to share.  It is quite a lot of food.  We were absolutely stuffed and still took some home.  I love meals like that!  And the flavors were out of this world.  Unlike anything I've ever tried before.  The meats were cooked perfectly and were absolutely delicious. 
We finished off with a sampler platter of Persian Ice Cream and Baklava.  Outstanding.
It was delicious and I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch Barg, let me tell you, this should not be lunch, more like lunch and diner.  The portion was plenty big and could have been easily shared with another.  I was very happy with it.  The flavor and taste is what I expected from center cuts of filet Mignon, skewered, marinated and broiled.  I went with a group of 6 and we opted to get the Persian Room Appetizer, again, a mistake on my part, the appetizer was perfect for 6, not totally unnecessary with the portions that we had.  The service was as expected from an up-scale type restaurant and would be great for taking the high-end clients to for celebrating a big success."}
{"text":"\"As Good As it Gets !!\"  The Kabob here are as authentic Persian as it can get.  This is from two of my dining 1st generation Persia born and raised friends who are discriminate about their Kabob.  

Persian Room is owned by a Persian family and this their second restaurant in the area. Their head cook has been with them for 12 years or so now.  This means a history of consistency. 

Our meal consisted of Beef, Lamb, Chicken kabob accompanied by Eggplant curry, Vegetable dish, Steaming bread, and Jasmine rice ( plain as well as one with mixed berry seeds ) and stuffed grape leaves. We also had orders of the yoghurt drink - nothing like the sweet lassi you get an Indian restaurants.

The food was far more than the 4 in my dining party in fact we couldn't even finish half of the amount. Each bite of every kabob, is juicy, moist, and perfectly balanced in aromatics and fresh taste.  The portions are traditional large serving and meant to be shared. The perfection in flavor is indescribably amazing.  There is no beating around the bush - kabob here are perfect!!! 

The ambiance evokes Persian feel in the interior architecture and decor of large chandelier, Persian rigs depicting historical figures hanging on the walls, an aura of inviting family atmosphere on the Mai floor and a more cozy private feel upstairs by a fully stocked bar.  Our serving staff were as courteous and attentive as can be.  

This place would be a great one to host a Yelp event where the attendees could be taken on a gastronomical tour of Persian cuisine.  

My hat off to the owners of Persian Room for achieving such dining experience for those coming in through its doors"}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance , tasty food and awesome fresh complimentary pita bread !! Delicious kabobs and generous portions .. Do try their icecream dessert its so so good :)"}
{"text":"I've been there twice already with a friend who is Persian so he told me what to get and taught me some stuff about what to try. The portions are huge so if you're a small girl like me, I recommend splitting. The bread is so good! You put onion and I think basil on it. It sounds weird but so good. Also, their tomatoes are pretty tasty. I think they dry them. Their desserts are good. The service is good. It's really pretty on the inside of the building. Dom lighting."}
{"text":"My first time at this amazing restaurant. Service was great but the food was out of this world. Fresh pitta with hummus Delish!!! Portions are huge we shared one plate and still had left overs. The best chicken I have ever had. I don't usually eat lamb but tried a bite and it was to die for. Definitely will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I found this place by surprise. My Bf and I wanted a nice romantic dinner and did not want the usually Italian restaurants so we landed here. Its a nice, huge place with dim lighting and very cozy ambiance. When we walked-in it was crowded, but we were immediately seated and served with pita break and a plate of onions, butter and cilantro (we are still at mystery with the whole concept of a big onion cut down the middle). For appis we just got hummus and that was amazing. For dinner, I had the chicken shish and it was to die for. My bf, since he's a vegetarian, got vegetarian kabob and he was disappointed. However, he enjoyed the hummus and the rice and pita bread. The drink menu was pretty legit. I had a Champagne Cosmo and it was absolutely amazing. If you are a meat eater you will love this place!

The only down to this place was that the service was pretty bad. Our server disappeared for most of the night. She took our order soon, but barely came back during the whole meal to check if we needed something and I usually need something. Other than that, it was great."}
{"text":"We love this place and travel forty minutes to get there. My boyfriend is from Iran and both of us find the food to be excellent. 

The atmosphere is really romantic and relaxing. We joke that the place is like one of those cartoons where there is a little tent in the middle of the desert and once you enter it you're in a palace. Its set just off the side of the road with hardly any other businesses in its complex. You walk in the restaurant and there are beautiful window tapestries, starry ceilings, a fountain, an upstairs bar, a separate room for entertaining. 

We are almost always greeted and seated quickly. Food has always been served at a nice pace as well (and I'm reviewing off of about 20 or so visits to this place in the last three years). Servers are very friendly and always bring us extra basil and bread when we ask. 

Our menu orders traditionally go as such: we both get the house cabernet for 6.00 and its very good. If we are with other people we order the combination appetizer which has several selections, if its just the two of us we go with the hummus which is a must if you are going to make sandwiches with the bread (similar to Indian naan), raw onion, and basil they give you. We share the Persian Room Special (a combination platter for 31.00) that could easily feed four. We eat just our leftovers for 2-3 meals over the next couple days! Includes basmati rice, filet mignon, chicken filet, and koobideh (ground beef) kabob. I always substitute half the rice for zereshk polo. I agree with several other reviewers to try the persian ice cream with the pistachios, very much worth it. 

We bring restaurant.com certificates with us sometimes and get out around 40.00, even when we don't its very affordable when you think about how many meals it covers over the next few days for two people."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints on the food.
You will be stuffed for sure and if you have a party of more people they always take care of you and everyone else"}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant for persian food. The food is always great and portions are huge. Anything you get from the menu you won't go wrong. My favorites are chicken filet sultani, lamb shank and for appetizer garlic yogurt, and of course you gotta try the saffron ice cream when you finish everything !"}
{"text":"When Olive Garden began their campaign, famously proclaiming; \"When you're here, you're home\", I never bought into it for one minute.
A few tasteless breadsticks and a bottomless salad doesn't wow me.

On the other hand, whenever I'm eating at the Persian Room that's exactly how I feel - at home - right down to my sitting in my underpants eating myself to death godless soul.

The staff at Persian is friendly and attentive, ambiance off the planet and the food is to die for.
I mean that. 
Literally, to die for.

If you're a white male under the belief that nobody can cook steak like you, guess what, you're in for a surprise son.

This food at Persian is so delicious, you'll eat.
Then switch into sport-eating mode halfway through the meal.
Then throw the fuck-it-all switch, culminating in a spangled, glutinous assault.

If kidnapping wasn't a federal offense, I'd have nabbed the entire kitchen staff years ago, taken a server or two, and maybe the cashier (for the shit of it) where they'd cook for me and feed me like a fat goldfish 24/7.

I'd eat everything in sight.
And when I ran out of Persian stuff,  I'd eat myself since I'd be stuffed with delicious Persian Room food.
Then I'd die."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, getting sick from the food was not the only issue. 
First, the waitress was completely rude and unfriendly. I don't think I've ever received just poor service, and I go out enough to know the difference between good and bad service. Second, the food came out very, very fast and it was less than warm - makes me wonder what their cooking practices are. Third, the taste of the food was certainly nothing special - I've had better at much cheaper places. If anything, much of it was bland. 

I've heard such stellar things about this place and only one person warned me against it. All I can say is that I'm sorry I didn't listen to the one."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with a friend. Very nice ambiance, it was a little warm but ok. Not too crowded for a Friday, had a reservation but probably didn't need it.  Tried the combo platter appetizer, very good. We also went for the Persian combo entree, supposed to be for 2 but probably could feed 3 to 4. Rice was excellent, meat very tender. Recommend for a date or nice evening party.  I thought the price would be more than it turned out even after wine and margarita. Too bad that after 9pm, it seemed like the place emptied real fast, we were ready to stay and enjoy talking longer. Hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"Really good food and service. We will be back. Try the Gyros it was so tender. The pita bread served warm was so delicious"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, but my experience here was not too impressive.
It started off great - the decor is nice, we were greeted and seated promptly.  Then out came a plate of basil and onion, with basket of delicious pita bread.  This kept our appetites at bay, while we awaited our waitress.  

Then it slid downhill... the waitress took awhile to get to our table and take our drink order.  By the time she arrived, I had already eaten half my pita basket, browsed my iphone for meaning of Gheimeh (it means \"stew\" in Persian), played with game apps while my husband left for restroom, read entire menu together and decided on meal.  Said waitress eventually arrived to get our full order, then we proceeded to wait some more.  We made conversation and entertained ourselves for 25 minutes, then I started to notice how long we were sitting.  That's when I began trying to make eye-contact with the waitress.  Unfortunately, she breezed by our table several times without stopping.   During this time, nary a glass was to be refilled.  After 35 minutes, we noticed another table with a large party (that sat down after us) was getting their food.  My husband actually suggested taking off - but I decided to wait it out.   Finally, after 45 minutes, our food arrived.

We ordered the Vegetable Gheimeh (remember kids, that means \"stew\") and the Lamb Loin meal.  Both entrees were just \"ok\".  The stew had vegetables that were cooked down to imperceptible mush and the flavor was entirely blah.   My husband's lamb entree was better, but also lacked much flavor.  Basmati rice was prepared fine, but still nothing special.   I didn't see or taste anything that would make me want to return.

Final verdict?  Save your money and visit another restaurant.  This one isn't horrible, but neither is it worth your time and money."}
{"text":"I came to Persian Room for dinner on my birthday. It has been noted in previous reviews that the service is lacking during the evening hours. That was a problem on my visit. They were busy, but there were plenty of open tables, and it looked like a normal dinner rush. Our server never asked us if we wanted drinks or specifically asked about appetizers, and he had to be told 15 minutes after we ordered appetizers that we wanted them before the meal. You may have a better experience coming in for lunch.

With that said, it is fairly easy to set up a reservation online. We had to wait about 5-10 minutes once we got there, but that was not really much of a problem.

We had the mast o moosier as an appetizer. Both the dish and the bread they brought out were very good. I ordered the sultani plate, which is a combination of the ground beef and filet mignon kabobs. It was not the best I have ever had, but it was about as close as it gets. The meat was cooked perfectly 'medium' and was very flavorful. The rice was your typical Persian rice, which I believe is the best kind of rice in the world. For those counting their calories, they have two different salads that you can order in place of the rice. I recommend the Shirazi salad, or even better, go half rice, half Shirazi salad. If I were to do something differently on my next visit, I would order another one of the yogurt appetizers to go with the main course. 

They brought out a small piece of baklava for my birthday. It was a nice dessert, but it was a little funny blowing out a candle that was stuck in a piece of baklava."}
{"text":"I finally went back to the Persian Room after moving back here from Australia. My family used to make me jealous talking about the Persian Room when I was on the other side of the world. I had my usual this time around. I loveeeee Ghormeh Sabzi with Tah Dig. Yummmy. I order the Beef Barg as my entree. It a super tender fillet. It was almost as good as I remembered. My only complaint is that we sat upstairs when no one else was there so the service or lack thereof was not good. I love Persian food so I must try Pars next!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Superb. Will not disappoint. I can't rave enough about this place. I moved to Arizona two years ago for school (I'm originally from California), and I've eaten here 6 times so far, and each time I've left very satisfied. Trust me, I would eat here more often if I could, but it's a 40-minute drive from where I live. I have tried Persian food at multiple restaurants in Southern California, Northern California, and Washington DC, but this is definitely my #1. I swear the only reason my mom comes to visit me here is so she can come to this restaurant! It's also very beautiful. It's decorated very elegantly. When I first walked in, I thought it was going to be way over my student budget, but it is so reasonably priced! And the portions are huge! I always leave with leftovers, and I have a big appetite, so that's definitely saying something. I have never seen bigger kabobs in my life. They bring out pita bread fresh from the tandoor oven, with a side of basil, onions, and butter. It's sooo good, but try not to spoil your appetite with it, because the best is yet to come. Their meat is always juicy, flavorful, succulent and tender. Never dry. I highly recommend the LAMB KOOBIDEH! Although the chicken and beef koobideh are among my favorites too. Also, the meat is HALAL (yay!). A group of my friends took a road trip from CA to visit me in AZ, and when I brought them here, they fell in love. They are Persian food lovers and have been to countless Persian restaurants across the country and agreed that this place was one of their list-toppers. No trip to AZ is complete without eating here!"}
{"text":"I couldn't help but to notice how many middle-eastern people of many different regions are eating here. When eating any type of ethnic food, even Mexican, I want to see a ton of people of that particular ethnicity eating and enjoying the food. First time there a while back and it was delicious and of course the portions are generous. The lamb is money as long as you don't want it burnt...the rice with raisins, dates and lentils was a surprise and the fresh naan...hellyeah!!!"}
{"text":"This was a first experience for me, but it is now on my list of \"go-to\" places.  There was a lot of rice served with each dish, but it was cooked superbly - fluffy and light with the right spices and flavors.  My favorite part of the experience was the giant plate of whole herbs served with the starters.  I had to ask the server how to eat them, and he said \"you just eat them\" - which is exactly what happened.  The humus was very light, creamy, and delicious."}
{"text":"This is some of the best food in town. It's incredibly flavorful, authentic and healthy. The portions serve two, at least - between that and the high quality, it's a great deal! 

The first thing you notice is that the place looks absolutely luxurious, a lovely example of Persian finery, and the prices don't include a surcharge for that :-) 

The service is always excellent - friendly and knowledgable, and high-end like the decor.  Over the course of many years and tons of visits, we have never had anything but excellent service - an incredibly unusual distinction.

I highly recommend the Zuresk Pollo (rice with saffron and barberries) and the mahi mahi. The humus is creamy and superb - definitely a must-try!

Every table is served fresh-baked pita-type bread with a side of basil, raw onion and butter (amazing combination if you're adventurous, and the bread is wonderful on its own if you're not feeling adventurous.

Dine in or take-out, you'll be glad you went! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"It's a must to try Persian food wherever I visit. So based on yelp reviews, Persian Room was our first option in Scottsdale area; without any doubt, we picked this location to dine-in.

We got here around 7pm and waited about an hour to be seated. While we were waiting we pay attention to the ambiance and customer service which was excellent. During this one hour wait time, we went over the menu and pictures and decided what we want, so the moment we got seated, we were ready to order.

We ordered: Tahdige Gheyme, Beef Sultani, Chicken Sultani, salad, and yogurt (mast-moosir). Complimentary lavash, butter, and basil came before our orders, then we had Tahdig as an appetizer which was a huge dish and the taste was just good. Beef sultani consists of one koobideh and one barg and basmati rice on the side, the koobideh was so tender and delicious but the barg well-cooked however we asked medium cook. The chicken barg sultani was just okay. 

The food was mediocre but nothing that I'd complain about, just mediocre!

The service and ambiance was outstanding, it was a very special evening and we really enjoyed our dinning experience!"}
{"text":"Have been here many many times and it has been inconsistent at times.  Before you read on, understand that I have eaten Persian food hundreds of times over years and that my reviews are generally 4 stars.  It bums me out to have to leave this but it's necessary.  In the past, the bread was freshly made, the beef koobideh excellent, the ghormeh sabzi very good and flavorful.  Not anymore.  Dinner time on Monday, semi busy, good service and ambiance is good as always.  Ordered Tadig and it was cold and rubbery with hot sauces poured over.  Rice can get like this when frozen and thawed, even when slightly burnt or crisped like with tadig.  Then the entrees, the zereshk polo with rice and ghormeh sabzi.  Both had that same flavorless soggy rice.  Probably thawed and warmed or microwaved.  If not, just poorly prepared.  The chicken with the first entree was super salty but hot.  The ghormeh sabzi is a number of vegetables that are cooked and sautéed until the green veggies turn almost black and with the meat usually has great flavor.  In this case, bland and the stew almost looked puréed, which sounds weird since usually this stew has some texture and is rustic.  Everything was just bad.  Even the bread was not fresh and just basic pita that was microwaved.  A glass of wine with our meals, a normal 20% tip, $100 total and a very disappointing meal.  Again, been here many times and use to leave reviews on Google and left this place a good one before, not now.  Not sure we want to ever go back."}
{"text":"My family and I have been dining at this place for probably over 7 years. I've never had a bad experience. Their food is delicious. I always get the Koobideh (Ground beef kebab). My father loves their Lamb shanks. Their Persian ice cream is delicious and I love their bread! Will never get bored of this place!"}
{"text":"On Sunday I had a family gathering for a small wedding dinner party. The service was excellent and the manager came by to make sure was going good. My family and I had a great time and the food was amazing like always.  Thank you so much Persian room for making it an amazing experience."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times with friends, family, and date night with the hubby.  YUMMY.  The ambiance is definitely different, feels like you are not in Scottsdale anymore for sure.  We have always been seated downstairs, which is basically a very large room with intricate decorations.  I am obsessed with the bread that comes automatically, delicious bread with toppings (onion, basil, butter) - you just put all that on top and eat it.  SOO good.  I also love the Tahdig (crispy crusty rice with toppings) and the Yogurt and garlic dip.  Delicious and a traditional Persian delicacy.  I only gave four starts because the entrees I've ordered have been average to above average and mostly remind me of other mediterranean restaurants I've been to all throughout the United States.  I've had the Loobia Polo & Koobideh and my husband gets the Chicken Barg.  Both are pretty good, and the meat is of very good quality and taste great, just nothing super special or different.  Regardless, we've always been super satisfied and had great service so I would definitely recommend, especially for those adventurous (but not too adventurous) eaters looking to try different types of cuisine."}
{"text":"Very busy night at this restaurant so we sat outside. Only one waitress for the whole patio and service was slow but when the huge platter of food arrived we quickly forgave the wait."}
{"text":"First time here for dinner.  Neighbor's brought us.  
2 of us Had the lamb shish kebab.  
Others has beef kebab and koobedah.
One ordered a special rice with berries.

Lots and lots of rice.  Lamb pieces 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.  
Honestly, I was very disappointed.  I'm Greek and Turkish this was not what I expected.

I asked for a cup of decaf coffee after dinner.  Nope....don't have any.  

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered #35 on the menu. Extremely disappointed. Four pieces of hard lamb... and 95% of the dish Jasmine rice. Very blah. Will never come back."}
{"text":"YES YES YES GO HERE. If you love grilled meat kebabs, you have to eat here. They have vegetarian stuff too so don't fret. 

Table is constantly served with fresh, thin slices of pita. Get the hummus omg it's so fresh and tastes nothing like that basic stuff at the grocery store. 

Lamb koobideh and chicken barg omg soooo goooood. The meat isn't spicy tho but they do have a hot sauce. Meat is so juice and tender tho so Omg bring napkins because you'll be thirsty AF for this meat. 

Staff was very friendly and helpful for ordering as well!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I was tempted to give 1 star...

**Our server was great, he was a young man, but I don't remember his name.

We have been to Persian Room many times (me since 2006, my husband prior to that) and probably for the first couple of years I would have given them 5 stars, and then, it keeps going down hill...

We used to go more often but for the same reason our visits are more sporadic nowadays. A few times the service has been terrible, specially with big groups, some huge delays, messed up orders, some other time our food arrived before our appetizer... go figure...

This last time the unthinkable happened... I didn't like the kashk bademjan... I am not the expert in Persian food, but up until that day kashk bademjan had always been delicious, creamy and you would have never known eggplant was involved. Well. Chunks. Huge chunks. One twice the size of my thumb. And seeds... and kashk nowhere to be seen...

Also, the gorgeous rice, long skinny grains, dark yellow, flavorful, seems to be a thing of the past... the rice was OK, but it was regular blah rice, that was not shiny Persian Room rice : (

Well, not everything is lost, their Koobideh is my favorite, it is still good. We also like the homemade doogh.
However, when you put everything together, for that price, I don't think it is worth it : ( While before, the rice itself was worth the trip and the check.

As a side note, we had a coupon, and we went there on Dec 31. The coupon had a holiday restriction, and I honestly considered that the holiday was January 1st. Well, the host/shift manager brought it back to us saying it was a holiday and they didn't even have the lunch specials that day, so they rejected our coupon.

We were not very happy, but oh well... However...  As we were leaving... my husband brought it to my attention... if it is a holiday and they don't have 'lunch', how come we got the blah pitas instead of the real naan? Anyway, the pitas reminded us why we don't go to lunch to Persian Room, and the bad kashk bademjun will remind us why we don't plan to go back any time soon... : (
I am sorry if I am overdoing it with the sad faces, but it is because this was one of our favorite places."}
{"text":"Every time I've been in Scottsdale I've wanted to try this place but never had the chance.  I finally got take out from here last week.  It was wonderful.  I am somewhat familiar with Persian food because my friend's mom would cook for us.  I was so happy to have tah dig (burnt crispy rice with gheimeh, a sour tomato-based stew).  We also had the Persian Room special and the lamb and chicken filet combination plate.  The chicken, the filet mignon, and the lamb koobideh were particularly good.  Even my parents, who hadn't had persian food before, enjoyed it."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!! If you don't like serving guests upstairs, please don't seat us up there. I eat out every day and I've never seen such lazy, careless service in my life. To start, It took 15 minutes to get greeted. When we finally did get greeted, it was by a rude server who seemed annoyed we were there. His first words to us were \"are you ready?\" That set the tone for the rest of the dinner. He went downstairs and came back up to check on us one time. The bartender working up there ignored us, we never even got refills on our drinks, and we had to go up to her to get our bill, even though all she was doing was just standing behind the bar doing nothing. The food was good, and they were playing Monday night raw on the tv upstairs which was the only reason they are getting one star from us. Your food is good, now please fix your service!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience each and every time. Love the food, drink, service and staff. 

I would truly recommend for an authentic Persian/Mediterranean experience. All their dishes are uniquely hand-crafted from scratch ingredients and always turn out succulent. 

Portions are incredibly generous and tasteful for the price you pay. 

Generally speaking I don't rant and rave about restaurants (in fact, most dining establishments I visit I rate 1 or 2 stars, so that speaks for itself.. I'm a very hard to please type of patron, but they sure do please).  

Thanks Persian Room. Will be coming back here with my clique and my lady friend for more good times and great food!"}
{"text":"We tried the Persian tour plate for three it had fillet mignon kebab, a mixture of ground beef minced onions and seasonings a mixture of ground beef kebab and a Cornish hen kebab. We also had the Persian room appetizer platter. The hummus was wonderful, it had a Suszycki type of yogurt and wonderful stuffed grape leaves! All of the different flavors were very fresh and unique! We will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant on a trip to Arizona and where do I start this place is great everything we ordered was cooked perfectly everything was seasoned well the waiter was very attentive and always checked in on us if we need anything and the bread the fresh bread is amazing we had the sultani, chicken, and chicken koobideh will be back next time I am in Arizona!"}
{"text":"The Persian Room is a self-important establishment with a gaudy décor and indifferent food.  It's not all bad, but the food isn't good enough to make me want to return.

The platters are large and the portions generous.  The pita is warm, the grilled tomato and basmati rice of reasonable quality, the basil and cilantro are fresh, the onion slices crisp.  The male waiters are formally dressed, the gold gilt and faux-columns match the tables with table-cloths and upholstered chairs.  So what's not to like?

Well, for one thing, the main courses - my lamb kubedah was simply bland - not bad, but just lacking in flavor.   Couple that with the pretentious atmosphere, and waiters who were more interested in socializing with each other than waiting on their patrons - and you've got a restaurant that could be good, but won't be drawing me back for another try."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Wonderful service truly authentic food I love these guys thank you for an amazing night."}
{"text":"Above average Persian food but the decor is amazing.  When you walk in you feel like you are entering a palace.  The staff is very friendly and the food is usually pretty quick.  Try the hummus with eggplant, dynamite.  We had the chicken kabobs which were pretty good.  Would definitely go again but would try a different dish."}
{"text":"I drive 1 hour to go to this restaurant. It's so good. Our lunch was $56 for a giant appetizer platter and giant meat trio platter. This would probably feed 4-5 people easily."}
{"text":"The service from our waiter was great. The food, well maybe we just don't know Persian food or what to order. The waiter gave us some favorites and we ordered from there. We got the hummus app, the Greek salad & the salmon dish. The hummus was good, the salad was good but we didn't like the house dressing so we ordered Italian & the salmon dish was ok. The rice didn't have much flavor. The place was busy & the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"for a friend's birthday celebration, we met up at the Persian Room. the decor and service here have a very high end feeling without the ridiculous prices. our server was expertly professional. when i had a question about whether or not to order a dish, he said \"try it. if you don't like, i'll bring you something else.\" i thought that was an excellent way of treating a customer. 

i had a new dish on the menu....heavy on the rice (which was cooked just perfectly), it had peas, baby mushrooms, beans, and lentils simmered in a tomato based sauce. it was a huge dish and i could only eat about half. i enjoyed the savoriness of the tomato sauce. 

also of note, the app they bring out of basil, cilantro, onion and bread....not something i would normally consider, but it was very tasty. with a side of their ultra dreamy creamy hummus and it was deeeelicious! 

what a nice meal!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum !!! This place rocks, so fresh and delicious totally satisfies!! The Jumna is perfect not to thick and seasoned just right, the iced tea is nice and dark very fresh tasting.  The pita is a bit on the thicker chewy side but still good.  I had the chicken & beef combo so Delish !!! I'll deff be back.  My waiter was very courteous"}
{"text":"Since I'm often with a \"Persian\", I have been here quite a few times. Just went again the other day. I enjoy the restaurant but since I'm not a meat eater, it's kinda hard to find alot to eat other than the appetizers. I love Love LOVE the yogurt cucumber drip and their soft warm bread. That's pretty much why I like the place. They do have some vegetarian stews but I'm not a huge fan of those. What I really like is the fesejuan (sp?) walnut pomegranate stew. It has chicken pieces in it but they will take it out for u, if u wanna pay. Last time they took it out and didn't make me pay... But now I guess with the crappy economy they now make u pay! Double the price of the entrée. Crazy. It does come with enough rice to feed u for days.
The \"persian\" I come here with loves the chicken kabob. He never eats chicken so I guess that says something... Hmmm... Persian chicken is better??"}
{"text":"As far as \"Persian\" food goes this place hits the nail on the head. The interior was way more upscale than it looks from the outside. Our family of 6 were seated immediately as walk-ins. Highlights were the hummus, fresh bread and varieties of well prepared rice dishes. I ordered the chicken koobideh and really liked it. As others have pointed out, the food portions are very  generous - you will be taking some leftovers home with you. Our service was good and as we were leaving there was a wait to be seated."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale with friends and family....starvinngggg.

We hadn't seen eachother for a long time so we decided to enjoy a fancy dinner.

The service here is amazing. Friendly, helpful, very attentive.

Minus two stars because I've definitely had better Persian food. But the experience itself is worth going. It's the classiest Persian restaurant I have been to."}
{"text":"I thought no way Persian food in Phoenix could be better than in LA. But Persian Room is certainly just as good as anywhere in LA, if not better! This always satisfies my Persian food craving. Love the meats and salads, and of course, the rice. Its also great as takeout."}
{"text":"Best Kabobs on Planet Phoenix!  Great classy establishment with a super fresh pita and the best meats around!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants of all time. I was introduced to this by my Persian family-friend because of its authenticity. I love going here for special occasions, simply because the atmosphere is so elegant and beautiful. The lamb koobideh and pita bread literally melts in your mouth. Just thinking about it is making my mouth water and my tummy rumble. Honestly, you couldn't go wrong with any dish. Even though this is a nice restaurant, the prices are reasonable. The portions are always huge (two people can probably share a platter), and the the food is high quality. The service is impeccable. Bread and water are brought to you within a few moments of sitting down, and then you are waited on soon after. The waiters and waitresses are always happy to serve you (some of them have worked there for years!). This is a true Persian restaurant, and I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent food in a beautiful venue. Make reservations if you can because it's usually crowded. Very generous portions with attentive service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix. I can say this is THE BEST PERSIAN food you can find around here. In fact, Im ready to go out on a limb and declare, its the best Persian food Ive had!  My favorites are the beef kubedeh and barg. Their bread is baked fresh and is devine as well. Dont forget to try their ice cream"}
{"text":"Good food excellent service would recommend everyone to go there. You do need a reservation if you have a big party."}
{"text":"The food is good.  The wait staff is friendly but the service is useless.  They are way understaffed.  The prep is quick but the service is intermittent at best.  Also the tsaziki is more like mayonnaise than the real thing."}
{"text":"Saturday's are super crazy, so figure you may be seated a little late. Ambiance is chaotic near the hostess desk, but once you are seated, very pleasant and posh.  They could help newbies along---they initially brought over a platter with warms pieces of pita bread, butter, a pile of super-fresh basil and cilantro, and a wedge of onion.  DH and I weren't sure what to do!  We had to wait until our waiter appeared, and he explained you butter the pita bread, pile on the herbs and a slice of onion, and eat it up.  It was nothing like we had ever done, but it was so good!  The pita was delicious!  We ordered as a starter, hummus.  The hummus was out-of-this-world!  I could have eaten that all day.  For entree, DH ordered a platter that combined Barg (skewers of filet mignon) and Koobideh, a seasoned ground beef kabob.  He ordered them medium.  When they arrived, the meat was lukewarm, cooked well-done (the filet was barely edible) and was so boring after the delicious hummus.  What  a let-down!  I ordered Sabzy Polo with fish.  Really generous portion of fish, but again---overcooked and very dry.  I will say neither of us have ever been served so much rice in our entire lives.  Could have fed a small village!  We didn't get dessert.  Service was pretty good, the waiter sort of disappeared at the end.  Conclusion: the entrees were a disappointment after the fun of the pita bread appetizer and then that wonderful hummus, but I will give it a try again.  DH says it was a fun experience, but he won't return.  Happily, I have a lot of friends who like to lunch!  Note: The Persian Room does NOT ACCEPT coupons on Saturdays."}
{"text":"My favorite Persian restaurant. Just wish we lived closer we would be regulars. Their koobideh is juicy, their chicken Laban flavorful and their bath melt in your mouth tender. Go and try some fabulous middle eastern flavors. Don't forget to try the flat bread they bring to your table. It's made in-house and is the best"}
{"text":"Holy cow! Probably the best Persian I've had. We went here for my sister in law's birthday, not knowing what to expect. The atmosphere was great, we were seated quickly without an appointment, and our waiter was attentive and helpful. Then, the food: the chicken kabobs were outstanding, so was the Mahi, and the fesenjean ( a sweet pomegranate, walnut, and chicken stew) was the best I've had, next to my wife's. Follow that up with a nice beer or a nice cocktail you're in great shape. Now for the surprise of the evening. My sister in law was treated to a lesson in how they make their bread. Check out the picture, she struggled a little, but practice makes perfect. Overall a great birthday spot."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon that gave me $30 worth of entrees, but I had to order at least three entrees to use it. I've heard great things, so decided to book a reservation to celebrate my birthday. 
We had a Sunday night reservation at 8:00 p.m.. We arrived promptly at 8:00, and the restaurant was hopping. We had to wait 10-15 minutes to be seated...not a problem. 
First, let me start by saying the the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous inside. It has a bit of a Grecian feel, with an upstairs bar, and a dramatic sweeping staircase. There are beautiful chandeliers and horse sculptures. 
We were seated at a lovely booth, and I was excited to try the wonderful food that I've heard and read about. We were immediately greeted and served homemade pita bread with butter, onion, and basil. The problem was that we had no silverware and no plates. Our server did not explain how to eat the appetizer that he brought, so I asked . I ordered a glass of Malbec, and made do without silverware or a plate, spreading the butter using the little plastic container that it came in. 
At least 10 minutes passed before the server showed up at our table without my wine. He asked if we were ready to order without asking if there were questions or offering recommendations. I inquired about my wine, and he said it was coming. I honestly believe he forgot about it. 
We ordered the Barg, which is skewered tenderloin,the chicken Koobideh, which has skewered chicken, and minced chicken mixed with onions and spices , and the shrimp and scallop dish served with Basmati rice. I have to say that the food was amazing and we had wonderful leftovers for the next day. 
The restaurant was obviously understaffed, and the servers and bussers were overworked. My server had a lot of tables, and his service suffered because of it. 
I landed on a 4 star rating because the food is a 5, and the service we received was a 2 or 3 star at best. I shouldn't have to ask for silverware, which didn't come until after our entrees were delivered . I shouldn't have to wait almost 20 minutes to get a glass of wine when there is a service bar downstairs for the servers. 
Our bill came to $92 with tip on top of the Groupon. It would have been worth it if the service had been on par. 
I will give the Persian Room another chance because I loved the ambiance and the food. I hope that they will staff a little better to accommodate the amount of business that they have."}
{"text":"The food in my opinion was bland and average and over priced.  Service was outstanding. I guess you really need to love Persian food to get your value. Portions are huge, with an appetizer you can easily split your meal."}
{"text":"I forgot how awesome this place is. I used to come for lunch with vendors back in the day, and made a last minute decision to book reservations for NYE. The place was absolutely packed, but we got our table about 10 minutes after our scheduled reservation which wasn't bad. My crew of people were loving the food, and we were completely stuffed. We had food to bring home and it was just as good the next day! Love this place and can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"The Persian Room is a big surprise the first time you go...I was expecting a hole in the wall - I am not sure why, but I was - instead, it is a very nice restaurant that is worthy of a business meal or a big date.

The food is exceptional and the service is quick and attentive. The portions are also quite generous. When my wife and I go, we either share one entree or we bring home some food.

Be sure to have some humus as an appetizer - it is excellent. The chicken kabobs are tender and juciy...but my favorite is the lamb."}
{"text":"My husband and myself are so happy our good friend George suggested the Persian Room. The food is authentic, delicious and plentiful...Alsia was so attentive and great which also made our dining experience memorable. We will be back... Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is my must dine there place when I go to Scottsdale. I'm in no way an expert on this cuisine but I enjoy the flavors and variety alot. I was traveling alone so I went up their impressive staircase to the bar. It's beautiful up there and much quieter. I had their vegetable appetizer sabzi, appetizer platter and loobia polo. That's all but it's a lot. I hardly made a dent.  As I dined, I sent pictures to my wife back on Maui. She loves the Persian Room and was envious"}
{"text":"This is my first visit. We stopped for lunch and were pleasantly surprised. It is a beautiful restaurant tucked in the corner with a large menu. We both had lunch dishes and the portions were very large and delicious.  I would recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"This place BLEW MY SOCKS OFF!  Better than I anticipated.
Food was excellent, the service was great and the value is certainly there.  Solid place and our server Jamie (server #458) was great!"}
{"text":"A OK. Food was average. Super LOUD! and I would say that many customers brought loud children. I have acutually never been to a place with more kids besides Chuckie Cheese's.

Don't think we will be back. Service was very slow:("}
{"text":"Great ambiance, and service. The food was impeccable. Like most Persian, it's mostly gluten-free. 

My only recommendation is to make a reservation, as it gets really busy. I almost waited an hour on the Friday evening that we went."}
{"text":"When I come to a restaurant, I'm looking for a pleasant and relaxed dining experience - not to feel more stressed than I do in the office. Instantly upon walking into the restaurant, my heart rate was up. The waiters were sprinting between the guests hoisting up giant plates of kebabs and rice, there were about 20 people standing in the entry way (big enough for 5-6 people), and the hostess looked incredibly frazzled. 

The restaurant, which I am told is always quite busy, is not equipped to handle its amount of guests. Every waiter seemed at the end of their rope. We had to wait 10-15 minutes past our reservation time to be seated, and most tables were waiting 45 min between ordering and receiving their food. Our own waiter had to apologize many times for the long wait for our food, although at the end he was able to bring our entrees as promptly as he could. It was definitely a busy night, but Persian Room overall needs to get their shit together!

When it comes to the food, overall no complaints. Hummus was great, as was most everything in the appetizer platter. We got 3 of the combination platters, which was way too much food for 6 people. Chicken kebabs were top notch. The barg filet mignon kebabs were disappointing. The fish kebabs got rave reviews from our party, and the basmati race was definitely high quality. I would go back to the Persian Room next time I'm in Scottsdale but would aim to return on a quieter night."}
{"text":"The initial impression of the Persian room is positive as it presents a unique and attractive ambiance. Immediately thought that this would be an upscale version of Sabas and Pita Jungle. 
For an appetizer, try the hummus and eggplant blend. It is a bland dish, but the texture was elegant and smooth.  There was no grittiness as you sometimes find in hummus.  
Ordered the rare beef garg with the vegetarian loobia polo rice upgrade.  The beef was cooked so perfectly but was short on seasoning. 
The kitchen made a huge mistake with the rice, using frozen/canned/leftover green beans, peas, and mushrooms - this ruined the exquisite tomato-infused rice. 
The thin bread went very well with the hummus eggplant blend. 
Another dish at my table ordered Cornish hen with sour cherry rice. They commented that the hen was under-seasoned, but the rice was terrific. 
I took the vegetarian loobia polo home and the next day literally picked out all the sad vegetables. The tomato rice was fantastic. Avoid vegetables in your rice at this place. Not sure I will give the place a second try."}
{"text":"Wow worst than last time I visited and more expensive as an example a Soltani is $27 where AZ kebab down the road was $17- not worth the delta so value has gone to 1. I did have their wine and the selection is limited and over priced. 

I got a post as to why I still go here- I don't usually it is some kind of function as example last time it was lunch after funeral, previous one was a client company function I could not get out, etc

{"text":"Awesome restaurant. The food is delicious and very well priced. You will not regret eating here."}
{"text":"I like Persian food and they serve pretty authentic food here, assuming what I used to eat often during my college years cooked by friends from Middle East was authentic.

Their potion size is huge. Never once I was able to finish a plate here before. Each dish is served rice, a half of the plate is filled with rice.

My favorite is rack of lamb. Lamb is cooked and spiced perfectly, it goes well with rice served. Don't forget the grilled tomato. Why is it tomato taste so good when grilled? It brings out real sweetness of tomato by grilling.

To finish off the dinner properly, I like to order Turkish coffee. After stuffing myself with yummy meat and rice, their strong coffee helps getting you food coma so hard. I normally liked to eat desert but not here. I become so full, my stomach cannot accept anymore food including sweets, so Turkish coffee will do."}
{"text":"Went there today around 8:30 service was good n we have been there before but this time we got very sick from the food it's very bad we went with our big family and we're very disappointed we love this place but not sure why there meat was bad this time hoping that it would get better this next time and not worse"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the service was outstanding, the atmosphere beautiful.  The GM Carlos took great care coming to our table to check on us even though it was a super busy night. I highly recommend the Persian Room to anyone who wants a fine dining experience they won't forget!"}
{"text":"Delicious, Persian food (very similar to Mediterranean) served like a work of art, with pita-style bread made to order and served gratis to every table. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but try the Chicken Koobideh for a different and enjoyable experience (ground chicken & spice kabob).

The hummus and yogurt dips are also exceptional, and pair nicely with the hot, made-to-order bread they give you.

Elegant but unimposing atmosphere. Very friendly wait service and staff too.

I'm a regular at this place, and for very good reason."}
{"text":"Probably one of the coolest restaurant atmospheres in Scottsdale.  The food is very authentic and it's presentation is great.  The only downside is the place needs to be bigger with larger tables for the size of portions.  Looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"If this place can impress my boyfriend's strict Indian mother, trust me, it will impress you too.  There's a cheesy gaudiness in the way the restaurant is decorated - a lot of gold, a lot of rugs, and a gigantic chandelier... But, it works. This is one of the oldest Persian restaurants in the valley and the decor really represents the institution that it is. 

Their combo platters are a steal. My boyfriend and I carry out here and we always get the Persian Room Special ($40). It comes with their filet mignon, chicken filet, and koobideh kebab. It's more than enough for two people and comes with a ton of meat.  Last time we were here with his parents, we got the dolmeh and it was the best I've ever had.

Would definitely recommend coming here with a big group, so you can get a sampling of everything!"}
{"text":"Ok so. This place based solely on how good the food is, it would be a 4-5 star rating 100%.Unfortunately the treatment we received was subpar at best. Our waiter Karim, was extremely rude with us. We entered the restaurant and requested to be seated at a certain section, the host straight up told us no without a reason or apology. By the time we finished eating and left, the area we requested was still vacant. Now on to Karim our waiter. We had another waiter come fill up our water on multiple occasions due to Karim being missing. When our drinks and appetizers were served, they were placed in the corner of the table and asked to spread them around ourselves... aka serve yourself I'm just your waiter here to watch you and get a tip. We also asked that on our entrees which come with rice, to remove rice and just substitute with salad. When we asked Karim if we can do this he said yes absolutely, once our bill came we got charge $4 extra per plate that had substituted salad for rice. Lastly to top all this off, when we asked to have the bill split, he got attitude and went to split the bill. He came back and the bill was split incorrectly, when we asked him to fix it he said he could not and responded with \"come on guys it's just $20 extra pay\" ...very very  rude."}
{"text":"Tell you the true , this place have an outstanding kabab place 
Tasty to die for , 
The service overall was fast and efficient 
Politely and with smile 
Not too noisy, but not quite also

Price worth what you get for"}
{"text":"Not sure why it took me so long to try Persian Room...
I've been hearing about it and driving by it since my move to AZ almost four years ago.  And I like Persian food.  But for whatever reason, I didn't pop my Persian Room cherry until just the other night!

My aunt was actually the one who chose to eat at Persian Room.  It was a Saturday night, and our party consisted of six - four ladies, me, and my brother.  We had some drinks and appetizers at home before we went, so we decided to order family style and share.  Wise decision...

Luciano was our server and provided us with excellent service along with the rest of the staff.  We ordered a (#10) Persian Appetizer platter to start, and it was perfect for sharing... it had hummus, eggplant dip, grape leaves, and a yogurt cucumber dip too.  We used the warm fresh bread to scoop it all up along with the fresh onions and Persian spices that were on the table too.  This could've been a meal in itself, it was all so tasty!

Next, we shared a #20 - Chicken Kebab plate, a #36 - Vegetarian Stew (which had okra and eggplant and tons of other veggies that I like), and a #28 - Sultani mixed meat platter.  We requested 1/2 rice and 1/2 greek salads with the platters.

This was just enough food for our group, although everything was delicious that had we ordered more, we would've kept eating for sure... instead, Luciano brought us out a couple of desserts (baklava and Persian ice cream) to share.  Mmmmmm - both were pretty fantastic!

Total bill for all of the above + three glasses of wine was just over $100... not so bad.  I enjoyed my meal and I'm sure I will not wait another few years to return.  As a matter of fact, I'd be game to return in the next few weeks.  Great place for a family style meal + quick and attentive service.  See you again soon, Luciano!"}
{"text":"Fantastic kabob! We went there on Xmass day the place was packed.  The service was slow but with a smile and the dinner buffet was great.  The barg was nice and juicy and the Koobideh was also very good.  I recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite specialty restaurant in the four years we've lived in AZ. We formerly lived in the greater NY City area and were accustomed to much more variety in dining, and were thrilled to find outstanding Persian food here!!  The service was excellent, we were not rushed, and the portions were huge!  We recommend this restaurant for anyone who loves Middle Eastern food!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely going back to this place! The ambiance is romantic, the food is wonderful, portion sizes are huge, and the staff is friendly.

Friends of ours ordered the combo platter - which is ridiculous in size. Seriously, this can feed a family of 4. But everyone loved it! We also ordered the mixed appetizer platter. I loved the hummus-eggplant combo spread.

Fresh pita was served on the table, which isn't always the case. Definitely a bonus!

We also ordered the chicken breast plate and the scallops/shrimp plate. Both are OK. My partner said the chicken was better on the combo plate and I thought the shrimp/scallops were a touch overcooked (hence the 4 star rating, not 5 stars). 

That being said, everything was very tasty and we will definitely go back! They are very accommodating with the menu as well. If you want something adjusted (i.e. ordering veggies instead of rice) they are more than happy to work with you!"}
{"text":"Made our yearly visit..this restaurant never disappoints...the food,is wonderful.plentiful and perfectly made...we,are,from New York..my husband is Iranian. And we eat a lot of Persian food...the chicken kebab is one of the best we've eaten..so tender and juicy...the rice perfectly cooked...only wish they had a restaurant in New York..."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would!! Not family friendly!! Be warned people!! This place has the worst customer service I have ever experienced!! My brother made reservations for our family on Mother's Day (2016) so obviously we had our kids with us. Amongst all the chaos & noise in the Resteraunt, the manager decided to pick on us TWICE about our kids being \"too loud\". The entire Resteraunt was in an uproar since they were so busy & couldn't handle their orders. The manager actually asked me to take my kids outside!!! ON MOTHERS DAY!! I've never had a worse experience than this! Clueless staff led by a clueless manager. The food also tastes like it's frozen & then thawed in a microwave! Yuck! Never returning here!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Persian Room. I've eaten here for years and always forget to review it - I have no clue why because it's amazing. I order a shareable entree and eat it for 2-3 days... every single time I go. I love all of the rice options, and I love the bread/pita/whatever we are calling it. The meat is always amazing (I usually get combo meats so I do mean all) it is just downright delicious. I get takeout frequently, but it's also fun to eat there. Beautiful inside, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, I would have given this place 5 stars if the service was better.  The food is excellent (except for the Persian Macaroni).  I would recommend the Vegetarian Loobia Polo.  The beef in the meat version is kind of tough.

The Koobideh is phenomenal.  You can tell that the skewer is homemade.

Don't go during busy times.  Lots of screaming kids; it'll take you an hour to get your food."}
{"text":"First time and I'd definitely like to go back.  We came at 5pm on a Sunday and it was packed! Both of us loved the warm bread with the butter, herbs and onions.  The potions are huge and the rice was amazing!"}
{"text":"Ah-mazing!!!! First time eating Iranian food and definitely won't be the last :) The bread with herbs was amazing. We got a platter with chicken, filet and ground beef...the portions were HUGE. Definitely more for three people. Drinks were mediocre but strong. Will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"For April's International Supper Club UYE, we went back to The Persian Room, and in 4 years of cohosting the ISCUYE, this is our 1st ever repeat of a place!

We were party of 14ish, and had a table upstairs. Service was friendly and answered whatever questions we had.

The server brought out baskets of warm pita bread and plates of fresh basil, onions and butter. I can tell you without a doubt the pita bread was delish! 

I probably ordered the same dish as last time but couldn't remember haha, but I went with chicken shish.  It was grilled chicken with bell peppers, onions, tomatoes and basmati rice. This is a great meal, the chicken was tender, juicy and flavored nicely, the peppers and onions were grilled perfectly, and the only downside was that it was just a lot of rice for me, but really is that an issue? Haha

Glad the ISCUYE went back to give the Persian Room another try!"}
{"text":"I've been to Persian Room more times than I can count in past 4 years, which in return tells us that I like their food. All 5 stars are for the amazing food that their kitchen produces. My favorites are Chicken Kabobs (the thigh meat) with rice and the Chicken/Beef Kobodeh(s). Be aware, the portions are HUGE (at least for me) and 2 people can easily share their platter.  I've been to many other Persian restaurants, both in AZ and specially in CA but Persian Room is my go-to place.

Also beware that they will give you some bread, butter and an onion prior to the main course arriving. If you fall in the trap and fill yourself on it then you may struggle to finish your food.  Been there, done that myself almost every time :) 

Some negatives:
I must also admit that I have never fully enjoyed dining into their restaurant. The sign says it is \"fine dining\" and may it was 30 years ago, but now it is just dining.  Because of their food, the restaurant is \"always\" packed and sometimes even have queues outside on the weekends. That translates to the occasional slow service inside and, personally, I've never been a fan of their decor, furniture and specially the cutlery. The cutlery is of a cheap restaurant. Everything else shows at least some effort being put in."}
{"text":"This place is nice! It's beautiful inside - it would be a nice place to take a date / significant other (they can also accommodate large groups). They have this grand staircase that leads up to a bar - a hazard for someone like me but I'm not imagining I'm the norm. 

The food is delicious. You start with bread at the table with fresh basil, onion and butter. I ordered the dolmehs as an addition to the bread and I was a little disappointed in them but they were definitely edible. They have many kebab options on the menu for every meat or non-meat taste. I decided to try the Chicken Shish which was served with rice and a grilled tomato. The food was delicious and abundant. But why stop at dinner? We had to try the Persian ice cream. I can't stress how delicious this ice cream was - it had pistachios in it. The pineapple mojito wasn't bad either, so good.

I would definitely recommend this place. Especially, if you're looking for a good place to have dinner and/or are staying at one of the nearby hotels."}
{"text":"So saddened to see this place deteriorate. My chicken filet skewer was rubbery. The manager took it back and brought me another plate with a skewer of rubbery chicken. Everyone else was nearly done eating when I got my plate... and my food was still terrible. I didn't feel like waiting another 10 min to eat, so I just skipped the chicken. And they didn't do anything to compensate us for the experience. The manger never came by to say anything. The check wasn't adjusted. There was nothing at all.

This place used to have really great food, but I guess those days have passed. Time to look for a different place for good Persian food... especially for those special occasions."}
{"text":"1 star to the waitress for attempting to come off as friendly. 0 for the rude bus boy who sprayed me and my food! He was spraying the table next to me and got me with the table! I turn to stare at him (as I cannot fathom why this just happened) and he goes \"sorry it's only water\". I highly doubt you are cleaning tables with only water and if you truly are then how is that sanitary? To top it all off, the food was seriously below average. We all ordered shish chicken plates and the chicken tasted like chicken gum or something and had no flavoring. The veggies were all burned to a blackened untastable sadness and the over flow of bland basmati rice made no sense. Perhaps our problem is that we are used to authentic seasoning and spices and are not happy to pay $19 a plate to get bland and odd textures of who knows what ?"}
{"text":"This is THE place I go to during any special occasion. And by that, I mean this is a place my parents take me to and use their hard earned salary to support me stuffing my pathetic privileged face with Mediterranean food like I was a fat kid who just discovered endless appetizers at T.G.I Friday's. And while I am adamant that Friday's is a classy establishment, this place definitely ups the decor with beautiful Middle Eastern rugs, paintings, chandeliers, and even a water fountain.
Of course, the food is what really sets this place apart. The chicken filet, the salmon, the beef koobideh, the polo...All of it tastes amazing. And while pricy, the serving size is enough to feed a small African village; essentially, you are paying for a few meals at the time. And if you order one of the party platters, you will honestly feel like a Sultan enjoying a feast (dont call your parents peasants tho)."}
{"text":"My Persian sister-from-another-mother took me here for the first time, and I am mad at her.  Not because this place is bad - oh no, it's spectacular.  I'm mad at her because of the fact that I crave these kebabs fortnightly.  I think I even dream about them.  Next time I see her, I'm going to hit her with a skewer of lamb koobideh.  And then eat it.

Persian Room is literally a palace, with a fountain in the middle of the dining room and golden plates.  The servers are working at a steady clip (although it's been evident on some visits that a slim few are way out of their league in terms of keeping up with the hustle), toting out fluffy mounds of rice and simply grilled meats to tables of customers dressed to the nines and dressed down in denim.  All have a place at this feast, whether it's date night or late night kebab craving.

We typically get the Shallot Yogurt or Eggplant with Whey as a starter so that we can sop up the deliciousness with the warm bread that is baked right in the dining room.  Of the kebabs, I'm madly in love with the chicken tenderloin kebab, the mahi mahi (which I have learned that in Farsi translates to \"fish fish\" - yes, I love the fish fish) and the aforementioned lamb koobideh.  You can stick with the fluffy white rice that comes standard, but I always sub in the Sabzi Polo (or green rice) that is studded with every herb in the garden for a glorious accompaniment to the kebobs.

If you can make it to tea and dessert, more power to you.  These portions are killer and the platters are behemoth.  Although, I have to say that in addition to feasting on the majesty while I am there, I do look forward to the leftovers later.  It's like the Persian gift that keeps on giving."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary lunch date and fell in love with it right away! The design in this restaurant is breathtaking! We ordered hummus and the yogurt dip and it was addicting! Our main courses were the chicken kabob plate and the beef kabob plate. The portions are HUGE so I suggest sharing with someone. It took awhile for the bread to come out but I understand because it was freshly getting baked. Our waiter had a very blank personality and rarely checked up on us. Overall I would come back because simply their food is amazing!"}
{"text":"The rice was dry. The lamb chops barely had any flavor. The shrimp and scallops were over cooked. The only good food we had was the dessert. Our Ludmila was awful. Our food took about 45 minutes to get to us. And she never once checked on us after somebody else brought our food. Manuel, \"her helper\" is the words she used was the only one who was very accommodating. He should have been our server since he did all the work. If I decide to come back, I will make sure not sit at her section."}
{"text":"Honestly, the best Middle Eastern restaurant in Arizona. Patron this place once every couple of months and often in large groups for get togethers.

Chicken and beef kubideh is amazing, combination platters for 2 will be enough food for 3-4. Get an appetizer platter, it's so delicious and very healthy. Two varieties of Hummus and they are both good, dolma really melts in your mouth, and the bread is so fresh. Oh, and the beef strips are AMAZING.

Waiters are always pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Great food , service and porsions ..... a classy persian food experience ..... one of the best in town .... only remakr is the chelo kabab needs a bit of thikness ...too thin ......"}
{"text":"Coming here for the eight or ninth time for dinner, we knew the food would be fantastic, but more importantly, we were mentally prepared for poor service. 

The Persian Room bills itself as a fine dining experience , but we know better, and thus were not expecting stellar service. Hence, when it took 45 minutes to receive the hummus / yogurt platter, we did not become upset.  The two types of yogurt were creamy, had enough lemon, and were quickly gobbled up by our party of eight. Drinks were brought out haphazardly and often forgotten completely.  The wine pours were the least generous I have ever seen. The specialty drinks were mixed well.  Sixty five minutes after we were seated, we were asked if we were ready to order. We replied that we we still waiting for our second appetizer, the Tah Dig.  They acknowledged that they forget and rushed the order.  It was, as expected, delicious.  The meat was cut with your fork tender. By now, the manager and two other people were trying to do good, comped our forgotten appetizer's ( we didn't ask)  and were falling over each other trying to redeem themselves.  As I mentioned, it was not a big deal since I expected the poor service knowing thr food would more than make up for the deficiencies.  

The food is great Persian food, likely the best in Arizona and would probably rank high in the LA area also. Four stars are strictly for the food.   I keep coming back with the expectation of relaxing, let the mistakes happen, and enjoy the tasty food."}
{"text":"My favourite Persian restaurant! The food was amazing and the ambiance was fantastic. A classy restaurant for date night and not expensive either."}
{"text":"Pretty good place! I came with a large group as a result of a friend who had arranged our dinner outing. We were asked to arrive by 7PM so we could be seated immediately. So my friend and I did just that, as did everyone else. However, the \"immediate seating\" didn't happen until about 45 minutes later. Although slacking at first, our service ended on a high note.

Once we did get seated, the food slowly started coming out the floodgates for everyone! Since it was a pre-arranged buffet meal, no menus were provided. I was slightly disappointed that the wait staff didn't really direct us how to eat one of the \"appetizers\"- basically on a big plate was an onion, some basil, and butter packets for bread. The hummus was amazing, as well as their salad. 

Then.... we each got a mound of rice. Kid you not- an entire plate of basmati rice for EACH PERSON! Then... sat in front of me was a plate to make anyone have meat sweats. Chicken, steak, veal, oh my! Some veggies too, but not a lot. Everything in our main course was well-seasoned and tender, so very filling! Crazy that even with a party of 20, there were leftovers. 

Our dessert was the homemade baklava and a baby cup of Turkish coffee. By that time, I was slightly fading from a long day + the biiig dinner. The coffee was a perfect temporary pick-me-up."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. I have been wanting to go here for years and finally made it for a pre-Valentine's dinner as well as my friends 25th anniversary. The food was fantastic! We will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"This is a short review.   I've never had \"Persian Food\" before.   It's kinda boring.   They give you enough rice to fill you up.   The meat is very bland and not much flavor or texture.

Place is sure fancy though.

Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have been eating at the Persian Room weekly for 5 years. I have had a fantastic meal every single time without fail. I love the hummus and the Barg platter(filet mignon over rice) the service is always top notch as well."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The flavors!! The service was absolute lately wonderful! A gem in the desert!!"}
{"text":"Best Persian food I've ever had, good portions and very reasonable prices also the people work there are very professional and nice! keep the good work."}
{"text":"The best Persian food I've ever tried. Their Soltani kabab is great. 

I usually go to this place once in a week and I have always found the food great. 

The only problem is that the dining chairs are too old and they need to be renewed."}
{"text":"A feast can certainly be had at the Persian Room. It's perfect for a large groups, the portions are huge! I think this was first Persian food experience and this spot was highly recommended by a Persian buddy. I was pleasantly surprised by the the complimentary lavosh (spelling?) bread served with basil, parsley, white onion and butter. Basically pile it on the bread, roll
It up and enjoy! We also ordered the hummus with eggplant, Delish! Next we ordered Tahdeek with two toppings I can't recall. The kabob platter with lamb, chicken and koobideh was equally tasty and plenty for three people. The shirazi salad was a refreshing side too. The entire meal was beyond satisfying. Our server Jason was wonderful and he kept the tea coming all night long. Looking forward to a return visit to try the Mahi Mahi!"}
{"text":"Food is good, ambience is great! But limited options for vegetarians. My husband and I were here for dinner, and it was quite busy, attributable to the long weekend. 

The restaurant has a very welcoming feel, and waiters are very courteous and alert. The fresh bread with butter, onions and basil reached our table even b4 we placed our order! Very happy with the service!!!

We ordered a Veg Appetizer Plate with hummus, pickles, salad, dolmeh and yoghurt dip. The dip was fantastic and hummus was great, salad and dolmeh was good. The pickled veggies were not to our liking. For maincourse, we had the only other veg option ... Veg Kabab with rice. This was good.

I would like to see more veg options on the menu to make this restaurant a regular. Good job Persian Room! Looking forward to more variety ...."}
{"text":"The food here is well prepared and extremely tasty! Even our little 1 year old daughter enjoyed some of the food. The best part was the entire staff was patient with us and our one year old that was curious about everything. 

We will definitely be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Amazing food which is consistently delicious. Our 4 year old daughter loves the lamb shank with Persian bread. Very kind an courteous staff. Be sure to tip well!"}
{"text":"I had went there for dinner with my family and friends to celebrate a night out and experienced  horrible service from the management , truly unsatisfied and would not go there anymore and would advise everyone I know not to go there aswell.. thanks"}
{"text":"I love this place.. The kebabs are just awesome.. The pitas are also great.. A dish called kobidah is very good in quantity.. 
The decor is very good.."}
{"text":"Place was right next door to the hotel I was staying at and was in the the mood for some middle eastern food. This place hit the spot food was good as was the service.  Definitely would go back next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Always excellent service and delicious food. Tried tour of Persia for the first time this week and it was great to be able to try a bit of everything. The service was impeccable as well."}
{"text":"First time here.  Because of the different cultures did not know how or what to use the bay leaf and fresh onion with.  Steak was very good, but personally I cannot eat rice dry and it was very dry. We had grape leaves with the yogurt sauce, it was very tasty.  My husband really enjoyed The Taj Mahal Beer. Good service, but no will not go back, nothing outstanding for us.

I brought home all the left over rice, put Persian sauce with cream cheese, sour cream, wine, red pepper, onion, garlic, raisin and apricot.  Sautéed marinated chicken and added to rice.  Served on the Pita bread with bay leaf.  Our guests raved on an on about it.

Just wanted to let you know how that the rice was not wasted."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what the hype is about. I agree that their hummus is great and that they grill their meat to perfection, but everything else is blah. There is a lack of variation in textures and flavours. Everything is one dimensional in taste. I left feeling utterly dissatisfied with the food."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch, dinner, in a small party of 2 to a large party of over 20 and was never disappointed.  A lovely place with great food.   The pita that they bring to your table is always fresh and I have a hard time not filling up on that with their yogurt and cucumber dip before my meal comes!  The portions are always very generous, you never leave hungry and I was never able to actually try dessert because i was always full from my meal."}
{"text":"I am so happy I got to try this place. The Persian room special is so good!! Comes with filet mignon, koobideh(ground beef), and chicken filet and so much basmati rice. It could definitely feed 3 hungry people easily, although the menu says it feed 2. I do like taking the leftovers home for lunch the next day because it tastes even better! For $38 I don't think it's expensive at all considering you have quality which is the most important then quantity is just an A+++"}
{"text":"Great Persian Restaurant in Phoenix. 
We really enjoyed everything we ordered there; we were on a trip to Scottsdale for few days and ended up going to this restaurant almost everyday. We tried different food, like Kebab, Stew with Tahdig, Albaloo Polo, etc. and all were tasty, fresh and really good. The service was also great. Sitting area/Dining Tables are good and overall atmosphere was fantastic. The price though is in the higher side but you will get what you pay for:)
I truly recommend."}
{"text":"Poor service - slow, error prone and had to be reminded repeatedly. Chef did a better job though. Chicken and lamb were nicely done but vegetarian dishes were mediocre."}
{"text":"Were in from out of town on business.  Made reservations on \"Open Table\" app. And even had to call and change time by 45 minutes due to meetings. Even though the place was busy, they were friendly and accommodated us without any question. Our table was promptly ready with our table... Our Server and Food was PHENOMENAL.. Hot, Presentation great, and taste even better... Between all of us we had an array of food,  Salad, Lamb, Chicken and Beef and each were equally wonderful, cooked to perfection. Our Server ( From Slovenia) as a delight. Friendly, attentive and fun. Will for sure go back every time we are in town for business and will take clients there."}
{"text":"The service could be better but I would do a 5 stat if this was corrected. I read the reviews and people say the food is bland I think it's because they eat chain food with lots of artificial and processed junk in it. The food here is pure the meat is grilled and not slathered in any sauce just seasoned. The rice is top notch and the bread , basil , onion and butter before the meal is a nice change from bread sticks or chips. I love this place and I have never had a bad experience in the 10 years I've been going here."}
{"text":"Best Persian food in town. Can't beat the service and the food of course. Servers are the best, manager is awesome...Carlos knows you by name and always makes sure you get the best ambience/service there. Perfect for big parties if you make a reservation or even if you don't. Hands down the best in AZ"}
{"text":"Best food in the world! Come hungry! Bring your appetite because the food is huge! Services awesome food is great service is amazing! I love how they remember me when I come in! It's like family"}
{"text":"When you come to Persian Room, be sure to bring your appetite! I ordered just a side (the loobia polo) and could only eat half of it! Having only tried one thing, I can tell you that's delicious, but I can't say much more about the food. 

The restaurant itself is classy, quiet, and pleasant. Raheem, my server, and his team were charming and excellent at their jobs.

I wish I lived in town, because I really think I'd be a regular here!"}
{"text":"They are not even Iranian . Without having the basic knowledge about the first and most important cultural traditions , where we call it hospitality.
Over the difference of 1.00  for bread you lost a long time client."}
{"text":"More Persian on the inside than it is on the outside from the street perspective. Magnificently delectable, with huge portions -- I recommend the #30 Barg which is Filet Mignon Kabob and the #23 Zereshk Polo with Chicken, both juicy and succulent. If two of you are feeling \"light\" then you could easily split one entree and perhaps a hummus appetizer. Most dishes are served with fluffy, long grain Basmati rice with Saffron, the most expensive spice in the world. And yes, it has a wonderful Persian ambiance inside, it feels like the socialite Middle Eastern scenes in \"Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol.\" In fact, if I ever get to date Paula Patton, I'm definitely bringing her to \"The Persian Room.\""}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for my B-day last week for starters I ordered the humus it is was very good...maybe the best that I have tasted....I ordered the beef kabob it was really good but I liked the chicken a lot better. They give you large helpings of food. This place is really good...I agree with another review this is good for special occasions. I am new to Persian food and was a little confused with the pita...basil...onion and butter platter and our server did not do a very good job explaining. Loved the bread I will go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Was delicous, but coming from eating a lot of middle eastern food, had to give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"The Persian Room has been one of our dining destinations whenever we crave for Persian cuisine, and is one of Santi's favorite restaurants. During our visit, the sizable interior looked grand, elegant, and captivating. Upon entering, there was a wide staircase leading to the second floor. The number of thick pillars also stood out, and the dining rooms were nicely composed with a row of beautiful curtains accompanying streaks of sunlight coming through the windows. The atmosphere can be inviting and festive, especially when it gets crowded during peak hours. 

Our appetizer, Tah dig ($9.95), came with crusted rice topped with Gheimeh Stew. The crispy and crunchy rice was made to perfection. The savory beef stew included some acidity from the dried lime, and sweetness stemming from split peas, onions, and fresh tomato sauce. We were impressed with the mix of shoestring fries, crunchy rice textures, and depth of flavors in the stew. Enough to feed three or more, this is our go-to appetizer at this restaurant.

During our visit, the Chicken Koobideh ($9.95) was made with ground chicken breast, minced onions, saffron, and seasoning. Skewered and cooked over open flame, the chicken was tender, moist, and busting with flavor. At time they would use green pepper in the ingredient, and I typically substitute the Basmati Rice with Albaloo Polo for an extra charge. It was well worth it since there were plenty of sour cherries that nicely intermingled with the chicken. 

The Lamb Koobideh ($10.95) came with ground lamb, minced onions, and seasonings. Skewered and cooked over open flame, this version of Koobideh was delicious too. The meat came with a higher fat content, so it was juicier than the chicken, and equally flavorful. 

The only dish I would not order again is the Lamb Loin ($22.95). Unfortunately, the marinated lamb loin tasted really gamey and undercooked. I replaced the Adas Polo with Albaloo, but the sweet and sour cherries could not overcome the gamey flavor.

Lastly, the Tour of Persia ($45.95) came with Barg, Cornish Hen, Beef Koobideh, Gheymeh Bademjan, Zereshk Polo and Basmati Rice. There were plenty of meat on the table, and fortunately we were with good company to help us to finish the platter. The Koobideh was overcooked, prompting it to crumble when forked into. That said, I still enjoyed the Cornish Hen and Barg.

Each meal also came with a stack of complimentary house-made pita to go with basil, onion, and butter. I noticed some of the less stellar experiences took place during peak hours, as service also tends to dwindle once the restaurant is filled. I recommend people to come for late lunch or early dinner for an optimal experience. I hope to try the Rack of Lamb on my next visit."}
{"text":"I'll preface this review with my inexperience with Persian food.  I've never had Persian food before this, so I have nothing to compare my experience with.  With that said, it wasn't a bad experience.

I knocked off one star because of the mediocre service -- I don't want to call it bad, per se, but our waitress pretty much brought us our food and never checked in on us again, even though she had time to mope around at the bar.  It took us a good fifteen minutes after we were finished to grab her attention and get our check.  My finance had to get up from his chair and flag her down.  I'd understand if it were busy, but there aren't that many tables up on the balcony where we were, so I expected better. 

The portions are ginormous.  I kid you not,  They say that the platter feeds two, but it fed my fiance and I for our next two meals.  The protein (chicken, sausage?, mahi-mahi) was delicious, flavorful, and tender.  Amazing.  The rice -- and there was lots of it -- was fluffy and cooked well.  Again, I admit my inexperience with Persian food, but I felt like it was missing a dash of salt.  

I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars, but I'll just round it up and give them the benefit of the doubt for the service. 

I would go back again."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here with a group of friends. We had reservations (yes you need reservations) for 6 people. It was quite busy, and pretty nice inside. The decor and building alone seemed fancy. Keep in mind - I never eat out where they take reservations. So I had high hopes coming into this place.

Started off a little awkward, because they were gonna sit us in a booth, but it wasn't big enough they said. Kinda odd. (No one was plus size in particular). After we were seated at a bigger table, the customer service seemed good. Drinks came out, as well as pita and hummus soon after. The hummus was pretty great compared to what I've had in the past. I think that was one of the best parts of this new place. The closest thing I've had to their menu style would have to be a couple of different Greek restaurants that I've been to. Me and my gf went with the \"tour of Persia\". It actually serves 3 people i think, but I can eat alot I said. The portions did not disappoint. They were enormous. Had some left overs obviously. - rice for days! Got the Persian ice cream for desert, which I heard was good. It was very unique with taste. It had an odd spice to it, with pistachio crumbs on top. We joked and said that it tasted like an antique shop. Which seemed accurate, not in a bad way lol.

Overall I liked this place. I think that the reservations are more for the quantity of people that pass thru this place vs the quality of food that drives people back. If I do find myself in North Scottsdale again, I shall give it another go. I do not see myself driving 38 minutes (Chandler) again though. 3 stars because I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"We decided to have dinner at the Persian Room.  When ordering, we substituted the rice that comes with the meal for a different type of rice.  The waitress had suggested that I substitute half my rice for small Greek salad. The meal came, the portions were huge and the food was good (not great).  We had to ask several times for refills on our hot tea.
 When the bill came we noticed that there was a $10 up charge for the substitutions. I mentioned this to the waitress and she said that she can see my point too (huh?) and would talk to the manager.  She came back to say that he would not take the up charges off because it was written on the menu that there's a charge. I asked to speak with him. His name is Mike.  I told him that the waitress had offered the rice/salad substitution and never said a word about the extra charges and didn't appreciate the up charges and he stated \" this is a fine dining establishment and we don't like to insult our customers by telling them about $2-$3 up charges here and there.\". I told him that he just insulted me that he assumed I don't know how fine dining works.  He said he would reverse the charges but \"next time...\" I told him there would be no next time.  He ultimately reversed the $10 in up charges. Oh and we never did get our refill on our tea...."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and one of the classiest Persian restaurants you will see. Being from California where there are a lot of Persian restaurants the food prices are a little high compared to Cali. But its a great place to dine at for any occasion."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to this restaurant. First time was two years ago when I didn't feel like writing a review. This time we were pleasantly surprised to find every dish we ordered (three in all) to be exceptional. Any Sultani kebab dish was fantastic. I tried the loobia rice which was phenomenal. The saffron Basmati rice pilaf was  also great. The Ghormeh Sabzi stew meat melted in your mouth. We were truly impressed by the quality, but all this was accompanied by truly exceptional service. One great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Went for a dinner for 5, The  chicken was brought out uncooked. The waiter got the order wrong two times and all the food was brought out"}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST persian restaurant in Arizona. 

I'm persian and from Los Angeles, I know good persian food. This is definitely GOOD PERSIAN FOOD.

Also, the restaurant itself is very beautiful."}
{"text":"First time to the Persian Room would definitely go back. Nice place and the service was great. We had hummus for an appetizer and beef and chicken kabobs, with a Greek salad. The portions are huge!The raspberry tea is worth a try to when you go."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here since I was staying at a near by hotel. I was seated upstairs in the bar area, at a table, which I really enjoyed from a seating view.

I had the lamb shank and it was incredible!

My rating reflects that I have only been there once, but if I am ever in the area I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food has always been amazing if you like meat cooked to perfection and huge portions of rice this is the place to go

My gf and I get the combo chicken and beef it's always good Their lamb shanks are great 

Only downside is that their to go portions are smaller then when you eat at the restaurant"}
{"text":"Was visiting Phoenix from KC for a conference and searching for places to eat and came across this place. Ordered the persian platter and by far one of the best persian food I have had in a while. It was enough to serve 3 ppl even. Servers were super fast with refills. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone looking for nice persian place to eat."}
{"text":"VERY overrated !

I read several reviews on Yelp and really was excited to take my friend here for dinner. What a disppointment!  The server showed up twice--once to TAKE our order, then the second time to ask if we wanted dessert and our bill.  This is not what you call SERVICE.

We ordered the combo lamb and chicken skewer.  The chicken was good but the lamb was extremely tough and full of fat.  Of course we couldn't send it back and address the problem since the server failed to follow up.

I ordered a martini straight up and it took over 45 minutes to receive it. When the bill came they charged me an UP charged since I asked for the normally included cranberry as a SPLASH on the side.  When I asked the server about this charge on the bill, she said that since the cranberry was presented with ICE they had to pour more liquor...I didn't ask for ice...just a splash that I could mix in. They normally include cranberry, chambord, pineapple, and more for the same inclusive price to this martini so this was not a justified up charge.

Heads up to those thinking about coming here.... You can go to several restaurants that offer excellent chicken/beef/and quality lamb skewers that are better quality and much more reasonable. It's clear that The Persian Room doesn't focus on this.

Suggestion, Offer smaller portions for less $$ and offer more attentive service. There's obviously a problem when 100% of the tables are taking food to go and paying top dollar for a meal that simply isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I frequent The Persian Room at least once a month and I am never disappointed! Service is great, waitstaff is awesome, and of course, the food is unbelievable!! As an appetizer, the hummus is a must, and anything you choose from the menu as a main dish, will not disappoint... my favorite is the koobideh, and I get it with half of the rice it comes with, and half of the Zereshk polo rice.. my husband loves the lamb shanks. The portions are plentiful, and most times we go home with half of the meal to enjoy the next day. We also enjoy the \"homemade\" bread that is brought to the table with butter, onion, and basil. Weather you live here, or just visiting, this is a definite go to place! Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"This is our family favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. The decor is very pretty and cozy, the food is amazing and the service is phenomenal. Mike our waiter was super nice.

In fact, we recently just had a 90th birthday celebration for my mother in-law and we had a great time."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for the weekend my friend told me I had to go to this place. Wow he was right! I have been to many great Persian restaurants. This is definitely one of the best. There is nothing gaudy about this place as mentioned by a previous reviewer. It is elegant, beautiful and immaculate. You feel special just walking in because it is obvious that they gave great attention to detail to the interior. The staff is perfect and very attentive. They make you feel like a cherished guest.  You are immediately greeted with sabzi khordan (fresh greens) and their amazing homemade hot bread. We ordered appetizers, entrees and dessert. Everything was wonderful. The portions were huge. I took half of my meal home and can't wait to eat it tomorrow.  The desserts were wonderful as well. I will visit here every time I am in Phoenix.  A fantastic meal!!"}
{"text":"Some of the tastiest Persian food I've ever had and you will ever probably have in the valley.  Order the \"kash-ke-badam-jon\" (or something to that effect) for an appetizer and you'll be pretty close to ethnic food heaven.  Their kebab plates are divine... make sure to substitute the dill rice.  Another bonus is the homemade pita... delicious!  Only reason they don't get 5 stars is because of inconsistency --- been there about 10 times and probably half of those times there was spotty service or a minor food-related issue.  If they're on the night you go you're in for a real treat!"}
{"text":"very flavorful, delicious food. 

incredibly large portions. you will leave here stuffed!

nice atmosphere. music is pleasant, staff is accommodating and nice. 

I recommend #49! excellent"}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. I had their beef cubes & it was dry. I couldn't even finish my meal. If you want good Persian food, I would suggest going somewhere else."}
{"text":"As always, the Persian room is one place that I will keep coming back to, simply for the great food. 

I made a reservation for two using open table and got there beforehand, and were seated 10 minutes agent the reservation time. The place was packed. Moments after we get seated, we get out plate of onions, Basila and butter and of course home baked bread. This is always my favorite part. 

we put in our appetizer order as well as the entrees, didn't wait long and out apologized lash O'bademjan was at the table, asked the gentleman who. Tooth the food out for more bread, his answer was yes sir but he walked away back in the kitchen (bread baking section was right across from me) any how out server came in and I asked for bread and got it immediately after. 

Food was fabulous as always, I ordered the loobia polo and koobideh (basmati rice with green beans and chunks of beef and a skewer on beef koobideh) a plate that I had never order and it was very good. My friend ordered the lamb koobideh and he enjoyed it thoroughly. We both ordered ice tea (I got Arnold palmer) and it was tasty. 

Before placing an order there, please note that the portions are huge, the prices are reasonable and deserts are to die for (didn't get any this visit), so do not fill up on bread or appetizers, leave room for desert and get half rice half salad (if the meal you order comes with rice) so you don't get full quick. 

I'll definitely come back"}
{"text":"Went there for Valentines day it was crowded but the service was good. Food was  outstanding. Larger servings. Would highly recommend going."}
{"text":"It was ok.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong items, but I was not impressed with the quality, on the other hand the quantity was very impressive."}
{"text":"This is REALLY good Persian food.  The plates for two are amazing.  The beef kubbideh, chicken, and pounded filet mignon is to die for.  The rice options are all very good.  The hummus and eggplant and hummus combo are both fantastic.  If you like Persian food this is the best place I've been out here."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff. Very helpful. I echo what others said:  rice with dates and raisins, Persian ice cream. Big portions. I had lamb kabob and was very pleased.  A fine experience.

This year is same as last year. Outstanding. Make a reservation!"}
{"text":"5 stars!

I went last night with my Persian hubby.  We live in NYC and he grew up on Persian food.  He said The Persian Room was one of the best Persian restaurants he had ever eaten at!  He's extremely picky, so I was very surprised to hear him say that.  I thought the value was awesome and the food tasted yummy!"}
{"text":"I have been her twice in the last month and I am so in love with this place!! The food is amazing the service amazing !! Ambiance lovely !! It's definitely one of my new favorite places."}
{"text":"we LOVE this place :)
The pita bread with accompaniments is excellent!
The portions are easily shared.
The ambiance is elegant without being stuffy!
Great value - LOVE this place :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 2008 this used to be one of my favorite places to bring friends and family to eat. But lately the food has changed its not the same, it doesn't taste the same the barg(steak chunks) were amazing now it's just another kabob restaurant the rice not well prepared and chicken too dry."}
{"text":"Best Persian food. Fresh bread and sabzi. Huge portions. Delicious rice ( Lubia polo and zereshk polo) and delicious kabob. Quick service.
5 days in Arizona, ate there twice."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants. Used to always order the #16 but since I don't eat chicken anymore I order the Mahi Mahi. Delicious! I'm not a big rice fan but I love their basmati/Jasmine goodness. Heck, my favorite thing about the place is probably the warm, freshly baked bread, butter, basil and onion combo. Perfect. On the pricey side but there's always leftovers! Warning: your fridge will smell funky but the food tastes just as good if not better the next day."}
{"text":"Great food, large portions, good service and reasonably priced happy hour deals! Vanessa was our server and she was wonderful. The restaurant is easy to find and the interior décor is beautiful. We'll definitely be back here soon."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a long time. Sat in the upstairs loft which is kind of weird, with a very long flight of stairs to get up there.  The food was great. The lamb entrees were all excellent and large portions. Service was just OK and very confused at times. I would go back but definitely sit downstairs. Maybe the service would be better there."}
{"text":"We were invited for my husband's company to have his holiday party here at the Persian Room. I was blown away by how amazing the service and food was. 
Starting out, when we arrived a mix up occurred with our reservation. Turns out they didn't quite have all the details for our party, but that didn't stop them for fixing it quite quickly for all of us. We were seating only 5 minutes later and it just got better from there.
It was our first time here (for my family) and we were a bit nervous as most of the food I didn't recognize. I was worried about my daughter as she is a picky eater but I was proven wrong on all accounts. The owner of my husband's company has been coming here for over 10 years and has never had anything he didn't like. He states it is as close to what he remembers from his own country.
We started out by ordering 2 of the Persian room appetizer platters...and other than the Hummus, I've never tried any of the others. Most amazing flavor came from the Dolmeh...which is now my favorite! The bread they served along with was simple yet delicious. A big hit and we ended up ordering more...twice. 
Next we ordered entrees but I had no idea the portions sizes were going to be enough to feed an army. (Leftovers!) I had the Sultani - Combination of barg (filet mignon) and Koobideh (Ground beef)...it was all so very, very good. Didn't want to stop eating. My daughter and husband had the Nederi - filet mignon & chicken. My daughter loved the flavor and fully enjoyed her meal. All meals came with a buttery type rice that was yummy!
After dinner, we all had hot tea, from which I understand is made quite differently than what I'm used to as hot tea. It was very good and we all ended up having 2 glasses with the dessert platters that ended the meal.
All in all, the meal, service and atmosphere of the place was truly amazing. I have informed my family of my experience and we are now going to return for our next family get-together. 
Thank you for having us."}
{"text":"The ambiance is lovely. We ordered the dolmeh (a little gummy) and as assortment of kebabs. The mahi mahi was seasoned pretty well, and the lamb, chicken, and bbeef were very tender; however they lacked any real taste. Wait staff was attentive."}
{"text":"I love the Persian Room. They have the best Persian food in town and their portions are huge. They also have a lot of gluten free options."}
{"text":"As always an amazing dinner! Fantastic service and Eddie always makes me special heart shaped bread - just for me :)"}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere. Service is much better than it use to be. Finally earned 5 stars."}
{"text":"I need to go back and take pics of this food. The kabob plates are spectacular and the rice is so good you want to get an order to take home. The decor is romantic and classy and the service was fine. The food does seem to take along time for grilled meat....but more time to socialize and be with someone special .This is great for date night , more dressy place, in my oprinion. Nice for AZ."}
{"text":"I have driven by the Persian Room for 9 years and never ventured in but last night I finally decided to try it out and I'm so glad that I did.  The view of the restaurant from the street does not convey the charm, warmth and decor of the inside of the restaurant.  It has great ambiance, wonderful service and amazing food.  Wine is reasonably priced and the food was amazing.  Ordered the Tour of Persia meal to share and it was great.  Food was seasoned perfectly and the giant plate had a nice variety of foods.  I loved the Persian Room and it's truly a hidden gem in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best food and service we've ever had! The portions are huge so be prepared to take some home. Our waitress was awesome and other staff came around to check on us and offer suggestions! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting at all. The chicken my party ordered was dry and sad. 

The portions were big though, considering where they are located and their price you expect better quality."}
{"text":"ORDER: the Hummus!! It's amazing, I could eat it by the spoonful! It comes with sliced cucumbers, tomatoes and olives-that are not pitted so be careful ;)

They have a grilled chicken platter that comes with rice and roasted tomatoes that's out of this world. I haven't ordered anything else since I've been coming here because it's so good. 

The ambiance is rich and lush with drapes that frame the windows. It's very unique. Dress it up or down either way is fine. 

This is a must try! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here to eat dinner and WOW! I am in love...with the food and not him.  Anyway, since he is Persian he showed me how to eat it, since they have such different traditions.  I mean, there is a platter of raw basil leaves just plucked from the plant on the table that you put on a piece of thin warm pita bread, spread hummus on it with a piece of onion and basil on top, roll it up in your fingers and eat away....who knew?
We got the chicken and beef kabobs, and typical Persian food it is all served on a platter which means to-go boxes at the end.
Try the yogurt with dill drink for something really, really unique.  Very different.
Service is good, prices for dinner are somewhat high but lunch is very reasonable.
I love this place!  I cannot wait for my son to come into the city, cause I am taking him there for sure.  This one is a super winner!!!!"}
{"text":"Huge portions and consistently good! Always crowded. I take my young kids there who love the food and the wait staff is so accommodating to clean up their mess even though I always offer."}
{"text":"Scottsdale Location: The Persian Room was recommended by a friend, for most of us it was our first time even hearing about the place. Upon getting there our first initial reaction was that the mood and atmosphere of the restaurant was a bit bland. If what you're looking for is a fun, and loud dinning experience, this place is not it. The Persian Room is more for family dinning and quiet events.
The staff at The Persian Room was very attentive and thoughtful. Our waiter made sure our drinks were filled, that we were comfortable, and when our food arrived he asked if it was the way we wished for it to be.
The food overall was delicious, however, the servings are huge and the pictures you see online are not an exaggeration at all!, but i was very disappointed when my platter came out. I ordered the chicken kabobs, on the plate there was more rice than chicken. I feel that the rice to protein ratio should be modified, its an obscene amount.
We recommend everyone to go and experience The Persian room at least once, the staff is wonderful and food is tasty!"}
{"text":"Good, quick and fairly priced.  Persian Room is definitely not an occasion restaurant but I'd be happy going back any week night.  The highlight was the minced lamb kebab."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for some good Persian food, and Persian Room doesn't disappoint! I have always had lackluster service when I have dined here, which is why the 3 stars instead of the 4 (which the food is!). They have some of the best hummus in town, I usually get the Chicken koobideh with zereshk polo and half salad! It's delicious. The dinner entrees are HUGE and you will most likely end up with leftovers.

The interior is beautiful as well! The Persian Room is a staple in the valley for Kabobs and Sultani. I also love that there in a middle eastern grocery store attached to the restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food was great. I'm a sucker for some grilled kabobs and grilled onions!   the mix appetizer platters were DELICIOUS! A bit confused on why a salad was placed in one of the little bowls ? That should be on the side in a different plate. 

On the other hand the atmosphere was wonderful. The inside reminded me of middle eastern royalty similar to the Middle East ? 

There was an upstairs but I couldn't tell what was up there ... mysterious  I'll be more determined when I come back for the fooood  

They also had an amazing ice cream flavor! Forgot the name but I think it's the only flavor they offer 

Definitely recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Being Persian, I will already state I am bias. But the Persian room really does stand by itself when it comes to Persian food in the Valley of the sun. Some of the best Kabob and dishes you will find this side of Tehran. I highly recommend this place if you are into Persian Cusine. The cast and crew are awesome: and the owner Nassar makes you feel at home!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing, i luv Persian food and i finally got to try this place a lil pricey but well worth every penny. Im stuffed and going home with tons off food ...must try! Service was great as well the young lady always came :-O my table to ask if we werw ok and didn't even uave to ask for a water refill. Water was always filled. I'd definately come back.."}
{"text":"It was the best Persian restaurant I have ever tried outside of Iran. Kebabs were tender and juicy. I really loved the Tah dig v Ghormesabzi and yogurt dip. Service was great too."}
{"text":"Their kababs and lamb shank are awesome. On the expensive side but definitely worth it. They have wide variety of rice although I am not a huge fan of them. Their pita is delicious, you cant stop eating them.
It is a nice date place."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why most Middle Eastern people are skinny but this place serves a mountain full of good quality, flavor full heaps of heavenly meal. I personally like the Barg tandem with shrimp and scallops. and yes I can eat all of it. BTW I'm barely pushing 150 LB. something about their basmati rice i cant quite put together, for some odd reason i can eat twice as much of these than a normal average rice. Anybody has an idea?"}
{"text":"This is my second time at the Persian room . I made a reservation on the open table app. On a busy Friday night for a friends birthday. I was there about 40 mins early and there was a long line. They were able to get us a table immediately although we were early. Service is excellent. The portions are pretty big. We ordered the chefs special combo (fish , chicken and chicken koobideh) and had tons of leftover for togo. My favorite was the grilled chicken. They also came out with a free birthday dessert for my friend, it was delightful"}
{"text":"Excellent Restaurant in North Scottsdale near the Fairmont Hotel.  I often take my clients for lunch and/or for dinner as it allows for delicious food, ambiance and a quiet place to meet.  This is also a wonderful place for Family night or date night out.  The Management and staff are courteous and will accommodate your food preferences.  I highly recommend this place if you want to enjoy a Healthy and delightful dish.  Just keep in mind that the food portions are rather large and always good to take home with you."}
{"text":"This place makes my short list of great ethnic restaurants. I get to Scottsdale frequently and this is my 2nd visit to the Persian Room. I will definitely be coming back. I am not an expert on food from this culture but I know what I like. So far, nothing here has disappointed. 

The service is friendly, helpful, polite and has just the right amount of guidance for people like me that are not that familiar with this type of food. We were served by Nico and she was right on with her suggestions. She represents the front of the house very well and my group felt welcome and well attended to by her. The menu is almost overwhelming because of all the choices but everything I tasted was delicious. Hummus and Stuffed Grape Leaves were a couple of favorites as was the house-made flat bread that comes straight out of their oven to the table. The Koobideh and the Chicken Barg were some mains that are recommended and a word to the wise...the portions are quite large. Surprisingly so given the reasonable prices for ethnic authenticity. 

This is not fancy, fine dining but it does get 5 stars from me because it has the total package: Great front-house staff, great food, and great execution of the entire meal. Anyone that does not enjoy themselves here either is a food coward or needs to be on anti-depressants. Looking forward already to my next visit!"}
{"text":"It took us 2 years to finally try this place out! Our friends have been dining here and getting hummus take out that I absolutely love for years and highly recommended the Persian Room. True to their words, we were not disappointed. Not sure why it took us this long to dine here. Even my son who doesn't eat chicken LOVED his chicken dinner. 

We ordered hummus app, Lamb Loin, Chicken Sultani, Gheymey Bademjan, beef sultani and a kid's chicken meal. Everything was delicious except I feel the stew could've had less lime. It was too tart. But everything else was perfect. Portions were big enough for sharing also.  We had plenty of leftovers... and we still do! Too bad I forgot to order hummus for takeout! 

Can't wait to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best place for Persian food in AZ. Having been there numerous times I've noticed that the food tastes the greatest if you go around 7 pm. 
Any of the kebobs are great. I would definitely recommend substituting your rice for the lubio. It's an amazing dish. 
Order anything off the menu per your liking. It is all good."}
{"text":"Great Persian restaurant!  Tasty rich food, great friendly service and nice decor.  What else can you ask for?  Try their combination platters...all meats have great flavors, tender and well presented.  When it says it serves 2 people, there are actually enough food for 3-4.  Don't forget to save room for desserts!  Persian (rose water) ice cream with baklava is my personal favorite!!  It also looks like they give you a free dessert for your birthday!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Been coming here for over 14 years. The art of food is a science here. I have spoken to the owner a few times and everything is measured perfectly. The onions and the spices etc. The food is very consistent. It is always the same.  Lucy was a fantastic waitress for us as well. The bread they make is warm and fresh. Too bad they are not in vegas"}
{"text":"Good ethnic food in Phoenix, recommended by my local friend.

Pros:

-Great lunch specials!!!
-Koobideh was delicious, very generous portions
-Great for a quick meal if you let them know you are in a time crunch
-pitas were soft and fresh

Cons:

-Location is kind of weird 

Verdict:

Would come back here but probably only when meeting in the area."}
{"text":"Interesting, over-the-top decor.  Unfortunately, the bland, overpriced food makes this place a no-go."}
{"text":"Went for a business lunch: ordered the Beef Kabab for lunch and it came with rice, peppers, and onions. For $16 I expected a little more meat and less rice but it was ok.

One of my other co-workers ordered the lamb shanks which were also good, but don't expect to get a lot of meat.

The complementary pita bread and yogurt/mint dressing was good and the service was great, the waiter was very friendly. He even gave a free slice of baklava for my other co-worker's birthday.

Overall, I would recommend going here if you want something different."}
{"text":"I'll walk you through my typical experience. Parking is terrible, reservation: still a 5-15 min wait. A bit crowded in terms of staff back and forth. A lot of times noisy or loud. A few times we've had servers/waiters/waitresses that were careless or neglectful. Sounds like a bad review right? Keep reading. 
The ambience is soothing and easy on the eyes. The included \"appetizer\" is a unique and appreciated addition. The selection is wide yet not overwelming and the quality of the food is remarkable. The front staff is smiling and happy to answer your questions. I've met the general manager, he was humble and generous with his time. I did mention some of the servers left something to be desired but I know at least 3 that were attentive and knowledgeable. I don't eat meat but I've tried everything on the seafood menu, all of which I would recommend; above all my favorite is the salmon. This place is always packed and if you're open to try ethnic based food, one visit will have you understanding why."}
{"text":"Always love this place. I stopped in with my girlfriend after a long day... Amazing food like usual... Never disappointed!!! Try it out!!!"}
{"text":"Our party went to the Persian Room for dinner. The atmosphere is very nice with a Persian themed dining room that is very classy. The chairs are comfortable. The food was excellent. The service was prompt, knowledgeable, efficient, and friendly.

The servings are huge. It's probably enough for most people to share or take home.  The food rivaled the home cooked Persian food I've had at friends' houses."}
{"text":"We loved the atmosphere with the ornate ceiling, drapes, walls and furniture. The food comes in generous portions and tasted great! (With the fresh pita our waiter provided us, we had enough food left over for two more meals.) We went to the upstairs bar to wait for our table, which was very nice. We were seated within 5-10 minutes of arrival. The waiter was very attentive to our needs throughout the meal and service in general was excellent. This is a large restaurant with every table full on Sunday night, and everything seemed to run like clockwork. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I wrote a not so nice review about my first experience here and was invited back, kindly, by the GM Carlos.

He informed me he wouldn't be working the night I would be coming back but set up a reservation anyways for me and my mother.

The staff was so nice and accommodating, they kept checking on me and my mom the entire time we were there.

We ordered a lovely eggplant hummus which was wonderful. Then, we got a huge entree to split between the two of us. I don't remember what it was called but I have a picture to add later on. It was FANTASTIC. The meat was tender and fresh.

Much to my surprise, Carlos showed up! He said he just wanted to stop by and see how things were. Such a kind gesture, such great customer service. It showed he really did care.

The server was genuine and kind, brought us out dessert and then let us know everything was taken care of. When we asked to leave gratuity she charged the card 10 cents and then gave us a quarter back. So nice!

I've been thoroughly impressed and can't wait to visit Persian Room again. I'm glad the manager Carlos invited me back, and I can definitely say I'll be back many times."}
{"text":"Jubi!  
Loved the food. They certainly know how to properly prepare Iranian food.

We had the most delicious:

Fenesjan (pomegranate walnut stew served with rice)

Khask Bademjan -  sp? (fried eggplant blended into a spread, served hot toped with fried onions and mint and dried whey)

Yogurt Dip with cucumbers - Forgive me I forgot how to say this in farsi.... 

They cook the rice perfectly, coming out how it should - not too moist, not to dry, lighlty scented - long grains - fluffy and zero mush consistency. Perfection.

They freshly make bread.... everything is fresh. The place is a bit old school decorated... but really feels like you are walking into an elegant persian home. I saw a sign for upstairs some sort of happy hour discount something, but only for those sitting upstairs. Worth investigating. Food is not cheap, but they do it right and it is delicious. 

Also - after dinner check out the market next door. It is open late and if you are lucky, the owner will give you a sample of a baked sesame nut sweet bread."}
{"text":"First off I want to say that the food here is awesome. I have been here many times and haven't had an issue until now. I purchased a gift card at Costco (Costco confirmed the cards were valid) and the restaurant wouldn't accept them. The Costco cards come in packs of 2 and the restaurant insists that it's a coupon and they only accept one. Since when is a gift card considered a coupon? I'm really disappointed in their management."}
{"text":"My Persian friends recommended this place to me. It has wonderful flavoring!  The chicken is so tender and juicy, and the meats are just perfection."}
{"text":"I'm big on service, and a firm believer that good service can overcome bad food, but not vice versa.  In this case, I was sorely disappointed.  The food, per usual, here at Persian Room was really amazing.  Unfortunately, it was a packed Friday night during the busiest season in Scottsdale.  Our waiter was woefully inattentive, or so we thought because he seemed to be spending more time downstairs than on the level that all of his tables were on.  After speaking to the Manager upon leaving, we were told that their POS system upstairs had gone down, so that the servers had to enter orders from the downstairs systems...  It was not well coordinated, and the patrons of the restaurant noticed every little hiccup that was occurring.  I understand not wanting people to know that you're having issues with the computer systems, but the sheer lack of communication makes the situation look ten times worse.  With regard to the food...it was still amazing.  Would I still recommend them?  Yes."}
{"text":"The food is great, Lots of flavor not over the top on spicy. Portions are large, The server's pay great attention to make sure you're happy.  We tried a couple of appetizers that are very flavorful. Chicken and Beef were very tender with just the right amount of spice.  They bring you the traditional garnish  And explain all the dishes if you need. High-end  decoder to make sure that you feel very comfortable as well"}

First visit in years!  I could've sworn I'd written a review, albeit a year or two *after* my very first visit with Mom and her ex- back when I still lived in Chandler ('04), or perhaps even before that, in Maricopa (horrors!).  I remembered that he, a carnivore at heart, had the #31 Sultani,  while Mom and I shared the # 19 Chicken shish.  We also shared a hummus app.  I vividly recall thinking Persian Room's pita bread stupefying, and I'm happy to report it still is!

It was a hard decision to make- what to have for dinner, after seeing \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" last night (go see it!!), but I decided I'd wait until I could treat Mom out for sushi and to go to PR, instead.  I tried to stop by for takeout on Valentine's Day, but my last minute decision, made after a public speaking class and a whirlwind two-hour writing session at the college library, was foiled when I encountered a packed parking lot, so I headed home instead.  It was easy to find parking tonight, and it was nice to see takeout menus waiting by the first set of glass doors (there are two), where I could comfortably read the menu before going through the second set of doors and place my order at the cashier/host desk.  The friendly female host took my order of Kashk O' Bademjan (app) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a2ZBDIXmwBm7IWnXR6LK-g?select=A8dp3ThElnflQAyEU6LNXQ#A8dp3ThElnflQAyEU6LNXQ and #33 Naderi (from the section of beef entrees) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a2ZBDIXmwBm7IWnXR6LK-g?select=GJNTuFYve2kjaT5XqTDdCA#GJNTuFYve2kjaT5XqTDdCA.  Note that \"all entrees include basmati rice, pita bread, and a grilled tomato.\"  I asked how long the order would take to prepare (\"about ten minutes\") and proceeded up the stairs to the lounge to read my book as I wait.  Or so I thought...

It was my first time up at the lounge, and it's cozy enough.  There are many two-top tables up there, in case you don't want to sit in the larger rooms downstairs, and the bar is comfortable enough to dine solo, or with a friend or two.  There is a TV for those who MUST watch sports as you dine with your companion or unfortunate date... As I've said, I was only going for takeout and was only up here to take advantage of the lighting, but silly me, I asked if PR offered happy hour, and sure enough, it does!  Monday to Friday, from 5p to 8p, happy hour discounts on beer and house wine ($4 glass instead of regular $6) AND a free app (hummus, hummus and eggplant, dolmeh, or yogurt and cucumber dip).  And so, I decided why not enjoy a glass of chard with the hummus I had passed on for dinner?  The pour was actually quite good, and tasty, and it paired nicely with the delicious sauce plate of hummus and a lone olive, topped with spices.  Hot pita bread followed shortly... I was blissful!  (Well, OK, I was very happy.  Yes, I was blissful, too, but that praise rightfully belongs to my lovely therapist at SWIHA!)

The takeout took a lot longer than ten minutes, but I wasn't going to argue, not when I was already full from my app and tipsy from the wine!

I hope to return more often!

p.s.  I did get to try a few pieces of chicken and filet mignon (delicately marinated, yet flavorful, and so tender!), with saffron rice (so buttery!), and another large piece of pita bread to enjoy a bit of the eggplant app with.  The entree was delicious, yet I don't think it's worth $21.95 for take out (see photo).  I could see paying that while dining in, since I have to factor in service and atmosphere, but for takeout...?

Ghaza aali bood, merci!

p.p.s.  Struck me a bit odd that I saw a lot of Asians, instead of Persians, entering and exiting the restaurant.  A bit surreal, I thought, but it could've been the chardonnay... :)"}
{"text":"The food is consistent excellent. Love the chicken kebab with baghla polo. Wish they had feta cheese instead of butter served with the bread"}
{"text":"The beef koobideh is still rocking the dishes! Very delicious.
However, the prices are increasing, and I hope they do not increase the prices a lot so we can afford for it."}
{"text":"I love this place! Massive portions of delicious food. The hummus with eggplant is amazing as is the beef koobideh. Yum!"}
{"text":"Went back to Persian room for are Christmas dinner with my family. the food is not the same my fillet tasted like it was boiled not grilled the chicken is  dry  and the rice tasted like it was burned .two stars is for the chicken eggplant borani only.
120$ down the drain"}
{"text":"Amazing food. HUGE portion, I could have shared it. A classy place to enjoy a night and good company. Prices are actually great for the quality and amount of food you get. Only thing is next time i will ask for the kifteh lula kabob to be more well done (personal choice) Will be back."}
{"text":"We have been going to the persimmon for years. We love the food and the quality of the ingredients. If you have friends visiting make sure to take him here because you will surely impress them"}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere.  You don't walk out smelling like your dinner like some other ethnic joints.  Dessert was great, and the meats were cooked to temperature.  The saffron rice is terrific.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Hosted a business dinner for 9 last night. Never been here but it was highly recommend. I was very impressed with the ambiance and service. The food was fabulous and the portions are huge. We started with the hummus and pita (I could eat just this and be thrilled) and the tha dig. Entree Chicken Barg was fabulous.
I was pleasantly surprised to see the bill was under $400. Including wine and cocktails. Great place, I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the Phoenix area has a sizable Persian immigrant population or whether the tiny numbers are just all at Persian Room, but I was surprised to see what looked like an authentic restaurant in a suburb on the edge of the desert that is far more concerned with money than even the semblance of diversity.

Since this was my family's first experience with Persian cuisine, we went with samplers all around. Coming from someone who appreciates the food, standouts were the eggplant hummus and the fesenjan I snuck in on the side.

I wish I could tell a story of redemption and enlightenment about how they came around to the variety of tastes but since they hate rice, flavor and change the results were somewhat predictable and this visit was likely ill-advised from the start.

The Persian ice cream (flavored with pistachio et. al.) was one of the few things to gain universal approval unlike the only actual miss of overly sweet baklava.

For huge plates of grilled meats, sizable varieties of rice, stews, fresh breads and subtly flavored sweets and everything else one would expect from Persian cuisine, especially in this area it's difficult to go wrong with Persian Room. Lacking a superpower that allows the instant digestion of grains, come hungry."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here since 2006 and the best koobideh and chicken sultani  and basmati rice in Arizona so far.  Mike the manager is the most professional and courteous. The only thing is I wish they had a baby changing  table in the restroom. We had my oldest son's babtism party and Mike did a wonderful job with the food and service. The ice cream is home made and it is my favorite ice cream in the state of Arizona. And the baklava is yummy too. Thanks Mike for always taking good care if us."}
{"text":"I was in the Phoenix area and was thinking about the Persian new year... So of course I had to get some Persian food. I ordered some stuffed grape leaves as an appetizer, which were excellent. Great flavor but the texture was just on the mushy side. I ordered the kebabs soltani, which has both ground beef kebab and filet mignon kebab. The ground beef kebab was excellent and worth going back for. To my disappointment the filet mignon kebab was dry and kind of grainy, which happens when you leave the filet marinating too long. But the fresh bread may have made up for any shortcomings in the kebab. And overall this was a fantastic meal. I will go back again."}
{"text":"Im Persian and recommend this place to people all the time. Nice atmosphere, good food and service. Always bring family here esp ones from out of town. They have super big portions good for 2 and alot of options to choose from. Ask for Nasir (owner) he'll take care of you"}
{"text":"This was our first time having Persian food.  We were up in Scottsdale last night, and decided to try it.

Firstly, the atmosphere is very ornate, with a huge staircase when you walk in, to the chandeliers and fancy lighting everywhere.  The dining tables had decorative cloth chairs, which reminded me of someone's fine dining room.  And, as soon as we walked in, we were greeted with smiles and seated.

We were immediately brought a basket of flat bread, which was warm and fresh.  Then, we were brought a plate of greens (found out they were Persian basil and cilantro), an onion and butter.  To be honest, we weren't really sure what to do with it.  It would've been nice, if we were asked if it was our first time here (which a lot of restaurants do), and then told how to eat this. 

Our waiter came over, and when we told him it was our first time, he answered any questions we had, which was a help.  We started with the hummus appetizer, which was really tasty.  We used the flat bread in the basket with it, since there were no dippers included.

For our entrees, hubby got the beef and filet koobideh and I got the lamb koobideh.  When they finally brought us our meals, we were amazed at how much food was on the plate, which included rice and a charred tomato.  Our waiter told us that we should peel the skin off the tomato, chop it up and mix it into the rice, along with some butter.  This actually turned out pretty good!  The beef, filet and lamb were tender and flavorful.  We both tried each others, and to be honest, I think the filet won hands down.  I think because it had a slightly different texture than the other two meats.  Hubby was able to finish all of his...not sure how, maybe because I helped him a bit.  But, I brought home a lot, which I ate a bit of this afternoon.  It was just as good as a leftover, I must say.

This was a fun adventure, and if we're in the area, we'd definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"Last night I met an old friend of mine for dinner at the Persian Room in Scottsdale on her recommendation.  Aside from the horrible traffic on Scottsdale Road, the restaurant is easy to find and seems to have plenty of parking.
The restaurant itself is nice but very westernized from the etched-glass entry doors to the Vegas-interpreted Persian decor.  I was actually hoping for something with a little more authentic feel to it, but hey, I was in Scottsdale.  It was not busy at all and we were seated immediately.  Our waiter was at the table within seconds to take drink orders and recommend some appetizers.  Shortly afterward we had our drinks and a basket of flat bread served with butter, onion and fresh basil.
We started off with their appetizer platter which included dolmeh, homous and eggplant, yogurt and cucumber dip and torshi.  Typical Mediterranean fair except for the torshi, which is like a vegetable relish in wine vinegar and actually very tasty.
The menu is not extensive, but there are some classics here that they do well and everything is served in huge portions.  We made our order and the food was served shortly afterward.  I ordered the Lamb Shank which was ok...I've had better.  It was not as tender as I had expected but it tasted good and the dill and lima bean rice served with it was also a nice complement.  My friend had ordered the Zereshk Polo with Chicken which is seasoned roast chicken served with the traditional Basmati rice with barberries and saffron.  I got to try a bite and was impressed with the mix of flavors and the tenderness of the chicken.
We followed everything up with their Persian Ice Cream dessert.  I enjoyed this immensely.  The texture was smooth, creamy and slightly elastic.  It was seasoned with crushed pistachios and saffron which provided a wonderful compliment to the vanilla base.
All in all, it was a good experience but not so much that I feel I have to make it a regular dinner destination."}
{"text":"What a great choice for review #700!! The Persian Room really impressed me when I went with a group for the April ISCUYE. This place has a really cool atmosphere and a ton of exotic looking décor. There was so much to look at. It was a just the right balance of classy and homey. I think they really put an effort into incorporating some culture without making it cheesy.

I had read plenty of the reviews before hand so I had to order the Eggplant hummus. It was every bit as good as my fellow Yelpers claimed. The eggplant was not a strong flavor so the hubby was willing to eat it. If anything I think it just gave it a nice smooth texture. Anyway, it was really, really good. I also wanted to try the cucumber salad which was exactly what is described in the menu: unpeeled cucumbers, diced tomatoes and a simple lemon and olive oil dressing. This was excellent as well... just the type of salad I would make at home. All the reviewers mentioned that the meal portions are huge and they were not kidding. But I wanted to get a salad anyway because I noticed none of the entrees are served with any vegetables. They are all just the meat with A TON of rice. So, basically what I would recommend is order the hummus or other dip as an appetizer, a salad, and one entrée and then that is the perfect amount of food for two people or maybe even 3 people.

Unfortunately hubby did not want to share so he ordered #31 Sultani. This is a combination of the filet mignon kabob (Barg) and the ground beef kabob (Koobideh). The Barg was absolutely amazing. An extremely tender and flavorful cut of beef! I didn't try the Koobideh but he said it was pretty good too. I ordered the #36 Lamb Shanks and it was delicious as well. I was too full already by that point to eat much of it but I did really enjoy the meat. The shank is usually the toughest part but this was braised so perfectly that it was fall-of-the-bone tender. They gave me two bones and they were both huge! I suspect that it was actually mutton, lol! But it was seriously very tender and delicious. The rice it came with had fava beans and some other spices in it but to be honest I found that it tasted bland and pretty much the same as everyone else's rice. I think they should really serve less of it since no one at the table finished their rice.

Overall a great experience. The service was also fantastic. In spite of the fact that our waitress could not describe for us what precisely the borders of the former Persian Empire were, everyone was very knowledgeable on the menu and helped us make some great choices since everything we ate was really enjoyable."}
{"text":"Not sure if this has changed hands, but the gyro I got had minimal meet at best. Big dissatisfaction. Won't be back"}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant if you want fancy persian food. I guess I should have known from the location, but this place is very posh. I'm not usually a fan of restaurants like this, but I was pleasantly surprised.

Now, let me start off by saying that I wasn't very ecstatic about visiting this place simply due to the fact that I knew it'd be pricey. My good friend ended up paying for the dinner, so I was definitely a little bit less critical. If you have a special occasion, and need persian food, then this is the place to go. The atmosphere is great and very high-end. The food is great, but the pricing...we'll get to that later.

Service is excellent as you would expect for such a great atmosphere. Like I said, this is a very high-end persian restaurant. The staff is friendly, and the waiters are very attentive. I really don't remember one bad thing about the staff at all. 5-star experience here.

Food is excellent as well. My two friends and I shared a kabob platter that came with chicken, beef, and lamb kabobs. They were all very perfectly cooked and extremely tender and juicy. We got burberry rice to go along with it, and while at first it was delicious, I think it just came with too much rice. They make their own naan, or whatever Persians call their bread. To me, this is worthy enough for a visit. There are very few places in Phoenix that make their own naan, especially Arab/Greek/Med places.

Dessert? Yeah, again, I was skeptical about the pistachio ice cream, but my friend ended up ordering it anyways (he's a regular at this place). Again, WOW. The ice cream was served in chilled cups, and it was just amazing. You could tell it was homemade ice cream, and the pistachio flavoring was just sublime. If you come here for a special occasion, and you have a significant other, you will score well if you order the ice cream. The texture of the ice cream was just perfect.

So why did I give this place a 4-star? I feel that if my friend paid $80 for food for the three of us that he should have taken a significant portion home. He took the leftover rice, and maybe 3 bites of kabobs. The pricing would be great if you got a little bit more food. Of course, you can argue quality over quantity, but I doubt they'd be losing money if they threw just a little bit more meat into their $45 meat sampler/platter. If you want to try something new for your significant other, or a special party or something then come here. Don't be upset though if your wallet is hurting afterwards.

I'm really torn about this place, and I want to give this place a 5-star (the food totally deserves it), but I just don't think I can ever go back, unless Obama gives me a stimulus package for my hunger."}
{"text":"I've been to The Persian Room a couple of times a year for the past 15 years. For dinner. Until today. 

I stopped in for lunch. 

The restaurant was more than half full at 1pm with luncheoners.

I placed my order for lamb shish kebab and Loobia Polo.

I expected the lunch portion at 1pm, since lunch is served until 3.

My lunch, or I should say, dinner, arrived and I looked at it thinking, that's a lot of rice. And was going to all the waiter of he mistakenly brought me a dinner portion. He didn't come back for 10 minutes so I ate because I was not going to let the food get cold. 

I'm of Albanian descent and grew up on lamb, every which was it is prepared.

The lunch, ie dinner came with 6 pieces of filleted lamb kebabs, so,  three whole lamb kebabs.  Therefore, I figured it must have been the lunch portion because there was very little lamb. About 6 ounces, if that. 

When the check came, I was charged for the dinner portion, over $24, with tax, plus $4.50 extra for the Loobia Polo, compared to a lesser upcharge for the lunch portion.

It's ridiculous for any waiter to assume someone coming in at 1pm wants the dinner portion, without asking them, rather than the lunch portion."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant !  

My parents came in town and I decided to take them here. My Persian parents are very picky about their Kabobs but they were very surprised about the quality of Persian Room's food. 

The service is mediocre. Not horrible but unwelcoming and do not check back with the table."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant anywhere. We are from Texas and make it a point to stop and eat here several times a year when traveling to California. The hummus and eggplant delight is amazing! The koobedeh and rice are heavenly. The decor is really nice too."}
{"text":"Their food is great and service is phenomenal. Make sure on a weekend to have a resevation. They will accommodate you but still you don't want to have a long wait time. I noticed their servers wear short dresses and skirts and for a family restaurant, they should be a little more conservative. Other than that the food is excellent."}
{"text":"I've been to Persian a number of times. Always went with the koobideh and barg combo with rice. I give that 5 stars. The service has been so-so. Three stars. The servers in black are excellent. Attentive. Courteous. The white shirted folks not so much. Inattentive. Lazy. Disrespectful and lack communication skills. I also don't recommend lamb. Any cut, style or preparation. I've been on the toilet for 4 days . Happy holidays."}
{"text":"Although I did come in for very early dinner, the food came out very quickly and the service was very good.  Raheem was an awesome waiter. I was worried since I was on a tight schedule but no problem.  It did seem like it was getting more harried as we were leaving around 6:30 though. 

Totally happy with the food, overall. Koobideh could have been a little more spiced.  Meat and rice seemed great quality, got the chicken filet sultani and the chicken was extra nice as expected.  Love the ice cream.  Next time will have to remember a sweater, it was super air conditioned inside.  I was shivering after 5 minutes. Will definitely be back sometime."}
{"text":"My friends and I get together once a month at an ethnic restaurant to enjoy food and drink and each others company.  I chose The Persian Room after many great experiences there.   None of my friends have been there before but they all raved about it after dinner.  I split the Persian Room Special with another friend and it was scrumptious.  The portions are large which I also like because they make great leftovers. The freshly baked flat bread is a amazing and I love the atmosphere.  I'm so glad this place is always consistently amazing!  Hats off to you!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.... Everything we had from alcohol n apps to desert was tender, fresh, and delicious! I had the #16, we all shared the combination appetizer, and had baklava and the Persian pastry ... So good! The chicken and baklava were my two favorites but it was all really good. I will be back for sure. Great service, great atmosphere, and great food!"}
{"text":"First time trying Persian food and I had a great time. Servers are nice and food were good.

The portions are big so my boyfriend and I ordered. One soup and one entree. Still it was a lot we Togo the left over"}
{"text":"This place really has mediocre food. Portions large. Heavy on starches. Low on flavor. Go to a diner. Skip this place. I will."}
{"text":"So I've been coming here for years since I was about 15 years old and the food and service was always amazing! This time I came in with my mom and dad on my dads birthday and the food was amazing as always but the service absolutely horrible. It started with my mom asking for lemons for her water that never came, then my dad dropped his fork asked for a new setting and got it way after his food came, and then when we were finished we asked for 2 teas and then decided to get a third which the waiter clearly forgot about because I saw him make a i turn as soon as he saw me starring him down. 

He really ruined our experience and if I didn't work in the restaurant industry I wouldn't have left any tip because we were one of his only tables and it was ridiculously bad service."}
{"text":"I figured this place would be expensive, being a Persian restaurant in Scottsdale. Instead it was very reasonable and gave A LOT of food, which allowed for about 2 more meals at home!"}
{"text":"The food at Persian Room is top-notch, and the naan is to die for, but the service is a bit odd. It may have just been our server, who hovered over the table and touched me a bit too much.

My family of eight individually ordered six different kabob dishes, and the server took it upon himself to present the meals in a \"family style\" setting. All the kabobs were on one plate, and the rice came in two platters.

It's hard to track if you're getting the right amount of kabobs, and someone who ordered sultani may be getting screwed out of his ratio of barg to koobideh, or maybe a chicken eater doesn't want the juice of red meat on her chicken barg. You get the idea.

If you want to serve it family style, please ask first.

Also, we luckily checked our receipt and noticed we were incorrectly charged for an extra tea and an extra glass of merlot. Upon being informed of the mistake, the server quickly removed it from our bill.

Expect to pay about $30 a person for appetizers and entrees."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my manager one afternoon. We were seated quickly and the service was alright. My manager introduced me to the onion/mint/butter/pita combo which I found amazing and could have eaten just that. We also ordered some hummus to share, which was very flavorful. For my meal, I had the Chicken filet sultani which is a TON of food. A lot of food but very very good. I could only eat about half and had the rest later that evening for dinner. I'll definitely be back and try to explore the menu a little more."}
{"text":"I would like to rate this place 3.5, just because I'm overwhelmed by the amount of rice I encountered. Restaurant is Pricy but food is delicious and portions are huge. Ambience, decor and feel is amazing. Service is average. We were served pita with a bowl of butter, half onion, lots of coriander and basil. We could eat the pita with the soup. I guess the rest of the items were meant to be be as is, We never figured it out. We ordered chef's special which consisted of mahi mahi kabob, chicken filet, chicken scoobydoo, 2 grilled tomatoes and lots & lots of basmati rice. The flavors on the chicken and fish were fantabulous. Rice was cooked to perfection Chicken koobideh was the best. Quarter way through the rice though it started feeling a little dry. I wish they served salad/ tahini sauce by cutting on the rice portions. We ended up to going more than half of the entree. For deserts we had baklava which  was yummy too. Definitely a place I'd go again, just hope I remember to substitute rice next time."}
{"text":"Best persian food outside of Iran. It's better than all the persian food in LA. I love the fresh bread. Order any food trust me it will be delicious!"}
{"text":"As many have noted the portions here are overloaded with rice; which would be ok if its was nice Persian dill rice, but its not.

The Chicken kabob my daughter ordered was pretty good.
My lamb kefta was a large portion, but it was woefully undercooked and lacked taste.  I would  have sent it back, but they could grill it a bit more; not sure how they would make it taste better.  I just picked out the properly cooked edges and left the rest behind.

Service was excellent, but the quality of the apps and food did not match the impressive interior of this place."}
{"text":"One word: Koobideh... yes, I'm Vegetarian, but I still fantasize about the the koobideh here. I've traveled in the Middle East and the flavors at Persian room is the closest to the flavors here. The serving is plentiful and I suggest coming here for lunch or early dinner... you will beat the crowd! It packs up quickly."}
{"text":"I'm used to Lebanese food and this was very similar. We had the appetizer sampler platter which was so worth it bc we were able to try just about everything. The rice was so fluffy, the meat super flavorful and tender. We were on vacation and decided to try this place based on Yelp reviews, so glad we did!!!"}
{"text":"Good food with ambience. This is a good spot for corporate events and dates. I like their Koobideh but you can get same quality of food for a much cheaper price at AZ kabob down the street"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Persian room since it was called Wine & kebab and had 3 tables with plastic chairs to sit on. Nasar is the kindest man and cares about making his Customers happy. There is not a Persian restaurant in the state of Arizona that can touch this man's food! I have never in 20yrs been dissatisfied with a meal that I've eaten nor has anyone that I have referred to his restaurant. The Persian Room is the best!!"}
{"text":"I found the Persian Room on Yelp and have wanted to check them out for months! I finally planned a girls night a couple of weeks ago. We drove about 45 minutes to get to the restaurant. I am happy to say it was worth the drive and can't wait to go again! The food was so good! Everything we had tasted great! The restaurant and embiance was beautiful and unique, the meat was so flavorful and the service was great!

P.S. Make sure you make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Went back again to the Persian Room for an amazing dinner with family that was in town. Once again, the hummus was the best part. Several family members commented that they could just eat that for the whole meal!

The service was on point again, and everything about the ambiance and food was amazing. I really do feel like this is my favorite restaurant in Arizona since I've moved here 4 years ago."}
{"text":"We had an interesting experience at the Persian room... The wife and I took our two kids who are adventurous eaters, not picky by any means, and I would say it was a \"good enough\" experience.

Upon being seated, we were presented with the free appetizer of naan, basil, butter and white onion.  Not being familiar we had to ask our server what to do... He kindly shared the process and we found that to be the most delicious part of our meal. All the diners loved the naan burrito.

We moved on to the entrée and we found that the simple dishes were the most delicious. Again, on the server's recommendation, I had the chicken kebabs.  The chicken was moist, the basmati rice was perfect. The wife had the appetizer platter for her entrée, and she really only enjoyed the dolmeh.  Our children are full-on carnivores but they did not enjoy their ground beef kebabs (Koobideh).  Being the father, of course I took some bites and I also didn't enjoy the taste of the ground beef kebabs.

I would say to keep it simple and order what you know, and you'll be happily surprised with your experience."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but I've eaten a lot of middle eastern food and I've had better. All the meats seem to use the same spices over and over, so there's no variety. The service was awful. Although the website shows happy hour Monday through Friday, they no longer honor Friday night happy hour. We asked to speak to the manager and we were told he'd come to our table....15 minutes later we asked again, but he never showed up. We didn't get a wine list. I asked for it twice, but it wasn't until after our appetizer and then our main dishes were served that they brought me a wine list. Beautiful place, but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I definitely ordered the wrong thing. I came here for lunch with my team from work and we had the outside veranda all to ourselves. It was really cute! Although it would have been fun to eat inside with the décor, outside was nice too. I ordered the gormeh sabzy. I would advise against it. It was not good. The flavor of the sauce was just weird. Fortunately my teammates let me try their food. One person got the beef koobideh and another got the hummus platter. The hummus tasted like any other store bought hummus I've tried. The koobideh was authentic and flavorful. Unfortunately I just didn't get the experience that others did that have come here before me, so I can't rate it higher than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness... the food here is SOOOO good! If you like lots and lots of meat, this is the place for you. We had the persian room special(serves 2) and it came with a chicken filet (A+), Borg (filet mignon) (A-/B+) and koobideh (B). It also came with a giant plate of delicious basmati rice. There was so much food that we our leftovers provided us with about 4 more meals, which we were really excited about.  The service is great, the waitor we had made great recommendations. They also have some very tasty fruity (but decievingly strong) drinks. We also had the persian ice cream for dessert and it was great!

The only reason I held back one star is because it's really expensive.  That being said, you get TONS of food, mostly meat and not a lot of cheap filler items.  Also, The atmosphere is a bit weird... its gaudy but kind of funny and for some reason it works.  

We had a restaurant.com gift certificate, which is what brought us there, and that made the price very reasonable. Grab one of those certificates and give it a try! We had a lot of fun eating here!"}
{"text":"We had to wait for about 20 minutes even after having an reservation. The front girl told us they give a table once it is available. I wasn't expecting this. 
What's the point of making a reservation if we still had to wait."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life!  Their Basmati rice is the best thing here.  It is so delicious!  All of the meat here is so tender it melts in your mouth.  If you haven't eaten here it's a must!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this establishment since it was on mountain view and via linda and called 'Wine and Kebab' and it is absolutely delicious. Nasser (the owner)and his staff keep a very high standard for food and service. I have been here hundreds of times and the few minuscule times that any mistakes happen, they correct it immediately and apologize. Excellent food, nice cozy ambiance, very authentically persian."}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype about the Persian Room, I decided to check it out with a friend of mine. Or rather, he suggested checking it out, and I graciously abided, seeing that I never pass up any opportunities for new culinary endeavors.

I was definitely pleased with the ambience of the Persian Room. Unfortunately, I didn't dress as appropriately as I would have liked, but contrary to popular belief, I didn't feel as out of place as I initially assumed I would. 

The drinks were wonderful, the appetizer (eggplant hummous) was wonderful, and the actual main entree lived up to standards. I had the chicken filet kebab, and it made me tingle from the top of my head to my toes. I loved it. I am, by no means, an expert on Persian food. I am sure that there are cities, such as Los Angeles, that have numerous Persian restaurants that provide wonderful food. However, I think this place is wonderful. The service was quick, and our waitress was so friendly and warm. I loved my experience, and I definitely will check out the Persian Room again...and again...and again. I'm sure I will frequent it so often, they will want me to leave."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today and was very pleasantly surprised. It's not often that places live up to the hype from friends and colleagues, but this place did not disappoint! 

We arrived promptly right when they opened for lunch and with a rather large party. We got seated immediately. The first thing you notice walking into this place is the attention to detail and the wonderful, breathtaking decor all around. The main doors are glass with inlaid carvings, the beautiful, steep staircase that leads to the second level and the running water in the fountain beneath it make the experience almost surreal. It's one of those rare first encounters where you look around and think to yourself, \"Wow, this really is something different and special,\" as you step inside. I'd almost forgotten what that felt like. 

Of course, having between awed by the look and feel of the place, the next natural questions is how the food stacks up. The ambiance is there, but the food still has to be on the mark, right? In this case, there was no disappointment. We started off as a group by passing around a pair of the appetizer combos as well as their delicious bread, and everything was outstanding. The bread was warm and fresh, the yogurt/zucchini spread was fantastic and the dolmas were some of the best I've had in recent memory. 

With appetizers having been devoured, we placed our orders and,shortly afterward, the food came out. Portion size is crazy off the dinner menu, which we all ordered from, but that was fine because the food was delicious. I tried the beef gyro platter and my wife dined on the chicken, which she let me try. Both were outstanding, well cooked and exceptionally well seasoned. I wouldn't say it was the best gyro meat I've ever had, but that's down to preference for the seasoning rather than the quality of the meat, so give them a pass and call the a close second, if anything. The chicken was equally good and I would definitely order either of these two dishes again in the future. 

Service was absolutely top notch from start to finish, which was very much appreciated, given the size our party. Drinks never ran dry, we never ran out of bread and our server did an amazing job giving us all the lowdown on what everything was, how to eat it and was very patient with everyone while they scoured the rather large menu to figure out what they wanted. 

On the whole, this was definitely a great place and I'm very much looking forward to going back in the near future. Absolutely outstanding service, great food and a very cool atmosphere, definitely five stars."}
{"text":"the service here was great... expesaly when the table caught on fire...they where quite helpfull...

everything was great... there was that cucumber thingy... and the ice cream thingy... and the portions where huge... and good wine selection... 

grrr why I need a course in Persise cause I can't remember the name of anything I had... but I remember the fire..."}
{"text":"Soooo much food!

If it is a busy day, it's difficult to find a parking spot. And be prepared for all or almost all the tables being full. The building is beautiful inside, and you get so much food!

If you don't want to shell out the big bucks, come for lunch! I had the gyros lunch special, but upgraded the basmati rice and it was very good. The salad was excellent. My gyros were ok. I'd would have liked them to have a little more kick.

This is a place that you should try at least once, for the food and the interior of the building!"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect from the Persian Room, but I'm usually very fond of mediterranean foods, so I was looking forward to the visit.

The service was good with ample warm baskets of pita.  Everyone at the table, though, agreed there was an unknown spice or two in the platters that tasted weird.  If you like rice, you'll get ample amounts of it with your order.  ( Too bad restaurants don't just serve one bowl of rice for the table.  I don't like that white mess on my plate.)  Considering how large the plates were, that's a lot of grain! 

Recommendations  
- sampler appetizer platter: The hummus is yummy, but watch out for the Torshi.  It's marinated in extreme vinegar.   
- Chicken eggplant borani: amazingly tasty

The veggie dishes are good too, but not fantastic.  I didn't take the leftovers."}
{"text":"Food was great, as usual, but management really needs to do something about the service. Every time we come here for lunch we wait and wait and wait. There are usually only 1-2 servers downstairs and half the time they cant be found. Its ridiculous.  Then, they leave tables full of the dishes from previous customers and take forever to get them cleared off. Its actually quite disgusting. 

Management: get a clue!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, friendly and attentive staff, huge portions, delicious food. I wish I lived near this place because I'd visit much more frequently. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Polo Zereshk . It was good. Service was quick. The chicken came with a gravy which was a little different, however it tasted good."}
{"text":"Simply amazing - the service and the food were superior in every respect.  My Ghormeh Sabzy (a stew with dried lime) was spectacular.  My wife's Chicken Filet Sultan, equally so.  The food is prepared perfectly, and the portions for dinner are enormous.  The lunch portions are smaller, but so are the prices.  We had two giant entrees and one beer and the total bill was $39 (before tip).  Cut $30 because I had a Groupon and, with tax = $18.76 (before tip).  Delicious food.  Amazing service from Rahim.  Large portions.  Low prices.  Terrific ambience.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Three years ago, I was not a big fan of Iranian food. Three years later, I am back to my roots and obsessed with Iranian food. Don't get this confused with other Mediterranean food. I still don't like that gyro crap. Iranian food is different from the other stuff. 

Anyway, I still LOVE LOVE this place and it is as delicious as ever,  but I knocked down a star because they played ARABIC MUSIC! I do not have a problem with Arabic music, but this place is PERSIAN. Persian Room, not Arab Room. Can we keep one thing for us please!!??"}
{"text":"The Persian Room was an absolute delight. Had came in just for drinks and ended up getting a meal... I had the gyro and the rice with the cherries. The basil, onion and pita that they brought out with the drinks was a pleasant suprise, reminded me very much of Europe! I am definitely coming back for dessert since all of it looks amazing! Especially the baklava with icecream and the Persian icecream that includes a passatchio flavor.  I'm so happy I found this gem and cannot wait to bring anyone that visits me here! Truly amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The service was great and so was the food. My friend hosted her party and with such a large group they did great!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Persian Room, several times and enjoy the food.  Went to a dinner party at Persian Room and honestly I can say I would never go there for a group event again.  One waitress and one tab for 25+ people.  The food was good, but the caos that followed dinner was not."}
{"text":"We loved this place - it is very FANCY - waterfalls and such.  The food was very good - I loved the lab kabob kind of thing.  I'm no expert in Persian food, but I do know what I like and it was delish - we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the restaurant is very nice! However, our waiter Alex was impatient and messed up our checks multiple times and walked away annoyed when we brought it up. I hope you get a better waiter than we did."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and amazingly hospitable place. This place should be a staple for anyone visiting Scottsdale for a nice bite of Mediterranean food. The dishes are well prepared and the drinks are on point. Be sure to save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"This review is not about the food but about the inconsiderate actions of the management. My family and I are visiting from out of town and a week prior to arriving in Phoenix we made a reservation for 4 for December 25 at 7:30. At 12:30 on the 25th I got an email from Open Table saying that the restaurant canceled our reservation. I called the restaurant to inquire and the person who answered said that there was a \"computer glitch\" and they don't take reservations on Dec 25.  So now we are left to try to find an open restaurant on Christmas Day evening.  Very inconsiderate and not appreciated. Keep this customer no-service in mind if you are thinking about eating here."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I'm obsessed with the Kash O'bademjan appetizer, a super delicious warm eggplant spread. And the rack of lamb is incredible. I've been there 3 times and always ordered those two items...I'm getting hungry just thinking about them!"}
{"text":"My friends from Kansas knew about this place before I even knew about it and I live in Arizona so we decided to try it out. Man I underestimated how good the menu looked but it is extravagant . I got the filet with rice . I also got this salty drink with mint and yogurt. The drink was so amazing and delicious. Last but not least their ice cream was to die for . It tasted like heaven and roses . The service was absolutely outstanding as well."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and it was amazing; my first time at the restaurant.  It does have the authenticity and food is delicious.  However, I really wish they served hot and fresh Persian bread NOT pita! It's for this reason why I have given it 4 stars, authentic Persian bread would complete the authenticity gap.  I'm from the DC area where we have many Persian restaurants but not a single one serves pita bread; it's Arabic bread not Persian. 

The service was amazing as well and awesome atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Sultani Combination (barg and koobideh)

This is by far the BEST Persian restaurant I've ever been too! Yes, even better than any of the ones in my home town San Jose / San Francisco. I wish you guys were out in my hometown, please open a restaurant here!"}
{"text":"Authentic Persian food, beautiful atmosphere, lovely decor, friendly staff, sufficient parking, and quick service. Ordered the Koobideh, lamb shank, and hummus, which were all delicious. Had my 24th birthday dinner here one of the times I came here and the restaurant surprised me with a delicious complimentary cake. The staff was the sweetest!"}
{"text":"As good as ever. I mainly eat here at lunchtime these days. The lunch specials here are delicious and probably the best value in the area. Still highly recommended."}
{"text":"We love the Persian Room!!!  This place is worth the trip. The flavor are incredible, the service is great, and the atmosphere is very traditional Persian. You know it's good when there is always a line for both dining in and take-out orders. If you don't mind sharing food, they have some delicious combination platters that are totally worth the price!  I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious!  A bit pricey, but, worth it.  The food is incredible.  The service is not as spectacular as I expected considering the type of restaurant.  
The fresh baked on site  bread is amazing!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here. The lentil soup, pita and hummus were standouts as was the raspberry iced tea. Gyro and chicken dishes with saffron rice and salad were good but not great. Service was slow but friendly."}
{"text":"One of the best Persian Restaurants I've ever been to! Having a Persian boyfriend, I've been to many Iranian/Persian restaurants. 
Setting:  housemade lavash bread is made all day. Neat how you can watch them in the dining area make & cut the bread. The Persian themed restaurant is decorated astonishingly, beautifully, & tastefully.
Food: food was fresh, of great quality, & cooked perfectly; excellent flavor while not being overwhelmingly salty. 
Service: it was a busy Sunday afternoon, service was still prompt & attentive. Food served timely.
Price: fair for quality & portion."}
{"text":"Very good Persian food.  The food alone gives the place 4 stars.

A couple of items that could take this place to 5 stars:

- The routing.  The kitchen is right next to the front desk, where we saw anywhere from 4 to 12 people waiting to be seated.  Lots of bumping, jostling, and getting out of the way of servers with huge plates of food.  It might take longer, but I think management should train the servers to take an immediate left and only go through the dining area.

- The furniture is a little worn.

- The carpet needs some regular and frequent sweeping.  We saw more than a little food on the ground.

- Attentiveness.  I'm not sure if it was the restaurant.com coupon or the fact that we weren't drinking, but I'd like someone to come around more often than every 30 minutes.

The food was truly terrific though.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and great food! Came here with my friends for the first time for a date night. We both got the Persian room special combination plate with lamb instead of koobideh. It is meant for two people, but with the amount of food you get, you can easily feed 3-4 people. I especially liked the barg (filet mignon), which was cooked perfectly and so tender and juicy. 
The bread the gave us at first was cold and kind of hard, but they brought us some fresh bread from the oven that infinitely better."}
{"text":"I thought I wrote a review but I don't see it. Anyway....I was there at 6 PM on a Friday night & the place was busy. We had reservations & were seated immediately. For starters, they bring a basket of pita bread and a plate with butter, raw onion, & fresh basil leaves. Quite a strange combination but when it's all eaten together, it's really good. The food is brought out on a huge oval plate but half of it is basmati rice, which was very good. Everything was very tasty. For dessert we had pistachio ice cream & baklava. I didn't like the baklava at all. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be like Greek baklava, but it wasn't. The filling was hard as a rock & very cinnamony. The dough was extremely dry. I didn't see or taste and honey. Again, maybe it's not supposed to be like Greek baklava. All in all I enjoyed my meal & would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had the lamb shank, it was tasty and had plenty of sauce. The lima bean rice went erll with it and I got two shanks with my order. Friendly service also"}
{"text":"My friends say it's a typical Persian restaurant with the decor, the dim lighting and running waterfall sounds. The food was excellent. I don't know much about Persian cuisine but my Persian friends were really excited about what the Persian room had to offer. They give you these flatbread type bread that's freshly baked and served with cilantro onion basil and butter. We ordered the homemade yogurt drink which you can order it flat or sparkling. I tasted both and preferred the flat. And I ordered a 34. The sultani. It had beef, chicken and like a ground meat. The flavors were amazing on the bismati rice! The chicken was just tender and juicy. The entire meal is filling and large making it hard to not take home leftovers. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone craving kabobs and to experience Persian culture."}
{"text":"Great place great food platters are huge tasty and nicely priced plenty of food for up to 3-4 people excellent wait staff"}
{"text":"incredible food.  Flavors wonderful.  Had combination dinner so could taste a lot. All wonderful.  Staff very attentive. Will be back."}
{"text":"Best Persian Food in Phoenix hands down!! I love their baghali polo and kebabs. I go here for as many special occasions as I possibly can ."}
{"text":"Well, the ambiance is beautiful and wonderful. The service was good. The food was shit, even the raspberry iced tea had no flavor. We got the chicken and lamb kabob with rice and the rice was not even done, a few pieces of the chicken were ok and the lamb was tasteless.. The Persian ice cream was delicious, it smelled like roses. But you have to keep in mind we were the last ones in there and the kitchen was about to close, so I imagine the food would have been better earlier. Overall, it was ok, but ive had better. I don't think I would come back, I tried it once, and maybe I'll try another Persian restaurant when I get the chance to compare the two."}
{"text":"This might sound a little weird but when I go to an \"ethnic\" restaurant I am usually cautious when the staff is \"American\" (I hope people catch my drift).  This restaurant has a very knowledgeable staff who can not only tell you about the menu but the background of the dish.  Our server gave us great recommendations on the food (which is also good as leftovers) and made sure to constantly check on us.  

Now the food.  It was delicious. I've had my fair share of Persian/Mediterranean/Lebanese food and this place ranks up there. The hummus was creamy and the bread was a great free starter. Me and my girlfriend split the Persian Plate Combo (could be named something else) but it was more than enough food for two and every meat had great flavor."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch special as we have many times before. Our server treated us as if we were complete idiots when ordering, and then proceeded to serve us the incorrect dishes. He never returned to check on us throughout the duration of the meal, and we sat for about 20 minutes after finishing until he finally returned to ask if we needed anything else. To top it all off, I have had horrible food poisoning from the meal for more than 24 hours. Persian Room used to be a family favorite but after this bad experience, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"The Persian Room is excellent in all aspects.  

The food is incredibly delicious, flavorful, and authentic.  The atmosphere is a little upscale, but you'll be just fine in a collared shirt and slacks.  As someone else mentioned, they make the pita bread in-house and it is absolute perfection.  This is one of the few places I happily spend more than $10 per person!

Im a cheapskate, and I LOVE the Persian Room.

I would recommend this for a first date, an anniversary, or just a nice dinner."}
{"text":"This place was just ahhh-mazing. The décor is unique. You can come for a more special occasion or casually. The hummus is ridiculously creamy and delicious. The grilled chicken and beef and lamb koobideh were so flavorful. The meat wasn't dry- per se... but I should have asked if they had some extra sauce to add to the meal... The meal also came with pita bread and a plate of fresh onion, cilantro, and mint leaves. 

The meal portion is HUGE. You will definitely have left overs .. Next time I'm thinking about just sharing one dish and hummus or something. Leftovers were just as yummy."}
{"text":"I've been to the Persian Room multiple times in the last ten years, ever since I moved to the area, and I have enjoyed it every time. (We came most recently on November 10, 2011.) Note: they also cater - my parents got Persian Room catered for their 25th anniversary (about 200 people) and everyone enjoyed it. 

The main attraction at the restaurant is the meat - most of the entrees consist of a large portion of meat, some vegetables, and a huge portion of delicious basmati rice. I have ordered several dishes from the chicken, lamb and beef sections, and have absolutely no complaints, so whatever you choose you will be delighted. The meat is always succulent and tender, and nicely spiced. 

Definitely try the hummus, as it is consistently delicious. 

On my thirteenth birthday (about ten years ago), the service was absolutely atrocious, but most other times I've been there, the service has been good. I've never needed a reservation, as the restaurant is always busy for dinner but not overcrowded."}
{"text":"This place is way overrated.  As a vegetarian there are limited options and based on the waiters recommendation ordered dolmeh.  It was ok but a whole plate of dolmeh?  Nothing to go with it?  They brought it out as my entree but it felt like an appetizer. WAY overpriced!!  The whole ambiance just felt weird and dated - like 80's over the top dark decor, thick curtains, but trying to pull off \"fancy\".  UGH, Service was terrible, waiters dressed very stuffy, but the whole experience definitely caters to the old retired crowd in North Scottsdale.  I'm good and haven't been back. For Persian food, I always wait until I visit LA where the food is absolutely stellar and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Very overrated. Our food was cold and my vegetarian dish was awful. Overall a bad experience."}
{"text":"I've been here about 3 times over the years and each time I've left here thinking it was a 'ok' meal but very expensive for what we got.  The restaurant is large and makes use of both floors. 

To be fair the pitas are made fresh there and taste great with some hummus.  However for me the true test of a Persian restaurant for me is the quality of their lamb, and this one disappointed each time.  The servings are large, come with rice and the beef and chicken dishes are cooked well, but lack some of the flavor experienced in other simplistic restaurants in the Valley.

Sadly, this is not one I feel I can recommend for this price point, I expect much more."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I wasn't sure what to expect but it's delicious. Huge portions and the need and basil are to die for!!
You won't regret coming here."}
{"text":"Persian Room is a staple when it comes to kabobs and sultani.  First the place is beautiful with a royal decor and chandeliers. The staff is always polite and helpful if you never had Persian food before. The meal always starts wth fresh pitas and herbs and onions. This was a new experience for me, but was a nice start. I got the koobideh which was juicy, flavorful, and perfect with the Persian rice. I also enjoyed the side salad and grilled vegetables.  I have been told that Persian food is not the healthiest, but I didn't feel too unhealthy eating it. I highly recommend this place and have been here multiple times."}
{"text":"this restaurant is located in Scottsdale Arizona I travel to the Phoenix metro area on business few times a year every time that I travel to Phoenix I try to make a trip to the Persian room as I find the quality of food very good as an Iranian heritage I tried to visit other Persian restaurants in different communities on my business trip I'm from my experience on all my trips I find this restaurant one of the best I could even say it is better than the ones I can find in Vancouver BC this restaurant produces its own fresh bread it is wonderful and if you are a traditional Persian food lover connoisseur you'll have to try The tadig. This dish restaurant quality over the past few years has not changed which is uncommon with most Iranian cuisine restaurants"}
{"text":"My favorite Persian restaurant. A bit expensive but the portions are bit. Go for lunch. It's the same food and size but half the price."}
{"text":"The best Persian food in Arizona. Only a home cooked meal by an Iranian might beat it. You can never go wrong with the beef or lamb kabob and the service is always spot on. If you are new to persian food, don't be shy when it comes to questions. The wait staff is very knowledgeable and eager to offer menu suggestions."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here,  awesome food and one of our favorite restaurants. Sadly, the past two times we have came the service has been horrible. We came last night, we got seated within ten minutes, the busser brought us out our water. The server (glasses, mustache, gray hair, older gentleman) was never to be seen after the time we placed our order. He never stopped by to ask us how the food was, never filled up our drinks, never asked if we needed anything. Just a very unpleasant man. Brought us out our check, still no word, no drinks filled. 

Although the food is delicious, the past two experiences we've had has definitely turned us off for now."}
{"text":"The food is great..I would not recommend going on weekends.  We went there on a Friday night it was crazy busy.  We had reservations and still had to wait.  The hostess literally sat us next their hostess station. And they made our table move to make more room for other people.."}
{"text":"This restaurant had been on my list for quite some time and when I finally got to dine here for lunch it was just eh. I hate it when that happens. I'm a pescatarian but was more in a veggie mood that day so I ordered the vegetable kabobs. Started off with the hummus as an appetizer though so I'll start there. REALLY amazing hummus, excellent warm fresh pita (best part of our meal). OK, now the kabobs, roasted zucchini, onion, potato, tomato over rice. No sauce, no flavor, no seasoning. I could've done this at home, it just didn't do anything for me at all. Lots of rice too so I basically had a carb meal (rice/veggies). My gf got the lamb shishkabob that had been recommended by 2 people. It was just OK according to her. It also arrived with lots of rice and a small salad. Mind you, I realize there is not a lot for a vegetarian here (I do not like eggplant btw, they do have that). So, it's not fair to rate them on lack of options but I've dined at middle eastern restaurants in the past and have had some really amazing food. My gf loves lamb too, but persian room just didn't have anything that made us say \"wow\" other than the hummus. Oh, and the service? Basically non-existent on a weekday for lunch btw. Overall a very bleh experience for us."}
{"text":"First time here and I came because of the reviews. Started with the appetizer platter #10 and we continued with the chicken Lamb combo and I have to say everything is great !!! Staff is great quick and smiles. I definitely recommend to come hungry:)"}
{"text":"Love their ice cream. Service is decent. Lots of food for the price, moderate. However, expect to leave very full and with leftovers."}
{"text":"Would have given 0 to this place if I could. We ordered food to go . Went by their menus on yelp. The meal had a price of 14.95 or something and we ended up being charged 24 because it was the weekend and their prices are different on Saturday and Sunday. Further more 4 plates were ordered we ended up with 5 and had to pay for it because they claimed we had ordered 5.there was four of us. They rip you off !!"}
{"text":"excellent quality food .best place to take Entire Family ,Birthday or date in persian room.they are always busy Make sure you call for reservation."}
{"text":"This food here is great. The portions are HUGE (making it a great value), the service is good, and the complimentary bread with onion and basil leaves is always made fresh, and is still warm when they bring it out to you. Only thing I've noticed is that families and students sometimes get sent to be seated upstairs (rather than on the main dining floor), regardless of whether or not you've made a reservation (I've asked one time, and they claimed it was random, but most times that where my girlfriend and I end up. It's fine though since it's quieter and you get a window view). Otherwise, this is my favorite place to get authentic Persian food in the valley, and I recommend it to anyone interested in the cuisine."}
{"text":"Professional staff. True chefs. Nothing artificial. Servers who remember you and treat you as a friend. Fantastic vegetable kebob and stew. World class."}
{"text":"Our 1st time dining here last night. The decor has a nice feel to it. The staff were warm and welcoming, and there was no wait (even on a Friday night).

The portions here are truly humongous. Two people could easily split an entree and still be stuffed. Started with the Hummus which was perfection, then managed to order about 20 pounds of chicken, beef, rice, and salad. Everything was well prepared and tasty. Our waitress had a great sense of humor too. Pricing is fair and would be a real bargain if you split a plate.

We will be sure to re-visit The Persian Room soon.

(I had driven by here about 100 times and I am proud to say I finally made it!)"}
{"text":"An amazing restaurant, great atmosphere, great service, and great food. It's a faviourt when taking clients out for lunch."}
{"text":"So, the food has always been outstanding!!! Chicken filet/filet steak combo is great... now let's talk about the drinks... 1st visit upstairs at the bar they had less then one shot of vodka in 3 bottles... 1 absolute, 1 stoli, and 1 Tito's... grey goose and Belvedere both empty.... 2nd visit was very happy they had grey goose so I got one on the rocks, when I asked for a second the mgr actually brought it because our waiter went mia... it tasted like anything but grey goose,so when the waiter finally showed I said this was no way what I ordered, he took the drink back and 10 min later came back and said they ran out of grey goose and replaced it with \"something else\"... REALLY??? Would have given a 5 if just for the food... I'd say next time we take out!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken shish kebab, eggplant borani, hummus, zeresh polo, lamb shanks, Persian ice cream. This place has good food and generous servings."}
{"text":"My friends and I recently started a toor of restaurants in the Phoenix area.  Our first experience was at the Persian Room and it was a great one. I will be back with out question.

Everything we ate was healthy, filling and delicious.  The eggplant hummus appetizer was off the charts good.  We did top off dinner with some really good pistachio type ice cream.  It was a perfect top to a very good meal!

We were very happy with our choice, and would recomend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The decor is delightful. The food is rather bland.

Maybe I should have stopped there and left that as a tip.

We went for a late lunch after 1 pm expecting the place to be quiet. However, when we arrived there was only one empty slot in the parking lot and the restaurant was hopping with activity. Many of the tables were full and the customers were all at different stages in their meals. Some ready to order, some enjoying dessert.

We were given water, pita bread, herbs, onion and hummus as we waited for our food. The waiter was very attentive yet had the air of a French waiter exhibiting that haughty deference that makes everyone a little cautious about what to say and how to say it.

When the food arrived, it was heaped on large oval platters; not a meal for a picky eater as there was enough food to feed two or three people on each plate. Unfortunately quantity doesn't make up for quality. There was nothing wrong with my beef stew, it just didn't have any flavor. The rice was pleasant, yet flavorless. The salad was fresh, but there was only just enough dressing to give it a mild flavor boost on a couple of bites.

For the price, I'm not a fan. If you have a Groupon or a restaurant card, so you get a good deal, this place is worth visiting once."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the food was off the Hook with Flavor the aroma. Just walking in made my mouth water. Service was fast and friendly (thank you Robert) and the food was truly outstanding. Im of Middle Eastern decent but have never had Persian/Iranian food and let me tell you, it won't be my last.... this has opened my eyes and stomach up to so much more. Lol Thank you"}
{"text":"They have some amazing food. The dolma salad and kebabs are YUMMY!  Service is usually good. Wish they opened one on the North West."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant. The food and service are great. We have been there several times and never been disappointed. Make sure you try their bread. It's sooo good because they make it fresh. I absolutely love this restaurant. I can't wait for my next visit!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best and most authentic Persian food you can get in AZ. My absolute favorite is their hummus/roasted eggplant - it's their version of baba ganoush and it is fabulous! We also get their cucumber sauce and make our own little roll ups with their freshly hand made pita breads onion,cilantro, and basil mint. It's so good you will roll out and have a carb overload but it's so worth it. Their dinner entrees are HUMONGOUS.   Our favorites are the beef filet and or grilled chicken. Comes with a huge portion of the best rice you have ever eaten! So fragrant and delicate-I haven't had a better rice anywhere else."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced and the food was pretty average compared to other middle eastern food that I had before.  Brought here by a co-worker, we had a quick turn.  Had the chicken kabob, a bit dry and the portion was small, they do serve it with a very big portion of rice on the side.  Pretty upscale design on the inside, I can see why a lot of people like to come here, but for me I probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"Great Persian cousin, high end and classy. Nice place for romantic date or any kind of dine.
Although I have seen better food around the world and the US, but I was impressed with the food.
The only problem, despite of the good food the service is slow. So please remember to be patient with the service and think a head of your order and refill. 
Again I was very impressed with the design of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! The food was to die for (had the cornish game hen) with basmati rice, grilled tomato, pita bread etc...the servings are plentiful and trust me you will not leave hungry. The meat was superbly tender and juicy...service by Vincent was absolutely awesome, as he was extremely friendly, welcoming and engaging. I highly recommend you ask for Vincent when dining at the Persian Room as I am confident that he will take great care of you and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent food... great service... best persian food I had in the USA!!! Their Lamb rack dish was so tasty and their khoobideh was really good... big portions..."}
{"text":"We came here last year for some good Persian food. It was pricey and super packed, but tasty. It took over an hour to get a table. I suggest coming midweek or early in the evening."}
{"text":"The Persian room special was amazing and back to normal ! I need to try something new on the menu but the special is just too good ! It's amazing how Kabab melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"This place is so crowded. The tables are so close together. People are packed in like sardines. 

However, because it's so busy, there was a sense is favorability and assurance that the food was good. I shared the gheimei Baden Jan with my husband. Now, I can't say I've had this dish before, therefore, can't compare it to past experiences. But I will not get this again. It's a personal preference - I don't like eating entrees the consistency of baby food. It had okra and eggplant. Now, I like those things a lot, separately.  But together, it was like eating a dinner that was puréed in a blender. I thought the flavor was lacking for two ingredients that really need them. 

I had a taste of my brother's lamb, beef, and ground beef kabob, and wish I had gotten that instead. So I think there is hope for this restaurant. 

Docking 2 stars for 1) less than stellar veggie dish and 2) waiter said the yogurt drink here is disgusting. I appreciate the honesty, but it adds another item to a list of sub par food here."}
{"text":"Long over due review. I moved to AZ from LA two years ago my  girlfreind  introduced me to this place and I have been hooked ever since!! It's up there with the best Persian restaurants in LA!! And the best part... they are always  consistent with the food quality!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Persian Room several times and every time I leave happy and full and even better with leftovers.  I had the Chicken Sultani with the loobia polo rice upgrade.  I usually do the Beef Sultani but just changed it up.  It was very good and with the lunch entree it is the same size and a few dollars cheaper.  For Persian food in Phoenix this is the best place I have been to."}
{"text":"Food is out of this world! I wish I could write two reviews: one for service, another for food. 

Service review: 

I don't recommend this place for families with young kids. Overall 4 stars for service for a mixture of poor and wonderful experiences. Service is a hit or miss in this place. 

Food review: 
I have had my share of fine dining. This is a place where you get fine dining quality with an affordable price tag. 
if you want to taste great food, dont think about it for a second. I give 10 stars for food. It is my yearlong dream every summer to visit Scottsdale and eat here as much as I can stuff in my belly:) I give this feedback as a person who generally doesn't eat meat ( I am not a vegetarian. The meat just has to be very convincing as in this case to go beyond one bite)"}
{"text":"The food was really good I had lamp shank with rise i tried the kebab & was really good as well"}
{"text":"Awesome Persian food. Probably the best I've had in a long time. I'm not Persian but I'm intimately familiar with the culture, food, and speak the language.  

You know this place is a good Persian place when you can order tadhig as an appetizer. That's clue number one. 

Clue number two is the inordinate amount of Persians speaking fluently in Farsi while eating. 

Clue number three is the owner, also Persian, at the front greeting people. 

The food itself was amazing. Great rice, perfect amount of saffron, etc. 

We had the barg kabab and koobideh. Both were worth it. 

Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Our dining experience was less than desirable & very disappointing. Save your money folks. There are much better dining options in Scottsdale!  
The decor is nice & is far superior than the service & food. 
When our waiter showed up he greeted us with \"are you ready?\".  There was no explanation of how to eat the onion, basil, cilantro & strips of bread/butter. 
The food was very bland. I had the veggie eggplant/okra dish which was very over cooked. The eggplant was gross and hard to even get on my fork. Very mushy and reminded me of snot!!!  The okra was mushy and flavorless. I ended up adding raw onion from the appetizer plate just to get some flavor. The rice was okay. 
My hubby had the veggie skewer and agreed it was very bland & tasteless. 
Not worth the price. We will never return!
Plus the staff needs a refresher course in customer service!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place with the fam several times a month and the food is always deliciously CONSISTENT! I've had amazing Middle Eastern food while living in Chicago for 12 years and so far, this is the best I've had in Arizona. The prices are a bit expensive for what consists mainly of rice and some meat, but the portions are huge - enough for two people.

If you haven't tried it I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We ate at the Persian room kind of late.  The wait staff was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed.  Our waitress took a request from us for an appetizer, usually not available that late, to the kitchen and brought it to us within 10-15 minutes.  We already had our food, but we certainly appreciated her effort.

The food is very good in general, but my wife did not like the Kabob Kubideh as much.  She thought the texture was off, too fluffy, which usually suggests a lot of filler in the mix, such as bread crumbs.  I had the Barg, which I though was decent.

One of the things I liked was the décor.  It is done very well and the high ceilings makes the place a lot larger than it actually is.

We plan to try it again.  I'll add pictures next time."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Don't be tricked by the high price.  The food is oily, not flavorful and certainly not fine persian cuisine.  More like Persian fast food...
The food doesn't suck but it's surely nothing I'd want twice.  I'll stick with darya in Orange County."}
{"text":"Yum. My dad got a gift card and took us. Lucky us. We split a bunch of stuff and had a ton of leftovers. I would recommend the beef koobideh. Cooked perfectly. They bring out pita bread and a plate with onions, butter, and basil and I'm not quite sure what to do with it."}
{"text":"Vegan review. I came here with the International Supper Club UYE earlier this year. I live close by but had never visited. This was the perfect occasion to finally try them.

As I perused the menu, it dawned on me just why I lived within walking distance but never visited... There are not a lot of appealing vegan options.  After conversing with the waitress, and upon her recommendation, I opted for the veggie kabob. It was blah. The basmati rice was the best part of that $15 dish.  I ordered hummus and we were given fresh basil and onions. I saw someone rolling up the basil and onions into a piece of pita bread, so I mimicked, and OMG! New flavor favorite! Basically, this is what you should order, if you're vegan. Add hummus to the concoction for best results!

Service was good, decor was nice. I'd only return for more hummus and basil yumminess."}
{"text":"Food here is excellent, restaurant is elegant and portions are huge. Some of the servers can be a little friendlier but other than that I have nothing but compliments for this restaurant. Barg is very good here. It is hard to find good barg. My wife likes the koobideh. I have been eating persian food all my life and in my opinion this is one of the best persian restaurants in the states. I make sure to eat here when I am visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love, Love, LOVE the zereshk pollo! I'm not very knowledgeable about Persian dishes, but the saffron rice with barberries (zereshk) is an incredible combination of flavors. 

The portions are much larger than they appear in the pictures on the menu... the plates are enormous. Be prepared for leftovers."}
{"text":"Great food, awful service.
I only go there when I really crave Persian food, and I really don't like to put a dim as a tip."}
{"text":"I've never written a review the same day I visited a restaurant but this one I couldn't wait to write about. It was the 3 of us (My wife, son and myself). We ordered one of those large combos of Chicken and Fish. It says it serves 2 but it could serve at least 3 which is great (big portions aren't a problem with us since we like take home the left overs). The food was great as usual and the salmon was to die for. So this concludes the good part of our visit. 
I worst part was the service. It was just plain awful from the same waitress that we always get stuck with when we visit (we come here often). Usually the service isn't terrible enough to warrant a bad review. But today was just special (in a bad way). This wasn't that cheap of an item off the menu and the restaurant wasn't too busy but I kid you not, we only saw the waitress twice; when we ordered and when she brought the food. Don't even get me started on her attitude. She may have missed the number 1 requirement taught at Waiting 101 which is smile. I would say I'll let it slide if it was the first time but she's always grouchy and today, extremely unfriendly. We finished our food and we waited about 10 minutes for her to come so we can ask for the check. Nope. She was chatting with the greeter and I tried my best to squeeze the last ounces of my patience, but to no success. So we just stood up, my wife went to the car with my son and I waited in line to pay for my expensive meal. Just terrific! HOW IN THE HECK IS A SERVICE LIKE THIS IS EXPECTED TO BE TOLERATED, especially on a WEEKEND? 

Of course she saw me waiting in line and she then came with the check. I said absolutely no word to her because if I have, it would have been unpleasant.

On a check that was around $60, I tipped her $3 and I still thought that was generous. I'm not even close to being cheap when it comes to tipping but this time I had to make a statement. 

To sum up; Terrible service from the older waitress (40s). The greeter was excellent. The owner (or manager) was excellent. The food was excellent. But if you care about service, you can either order to-go, or avoid the place when that grouchy waitress is working."}
{"text":"I found the restaraunt very tastefully decorated.  Wonderful home made bread and dough (yogurt drink).  Kabobs were wonderful and the portions very large.  The share for two can easily feed four!  Quality was not sacrificed."}
{"text":"Love love this place. I love everything on the menu here. Big portion sizes. Great service. Best Persian food in AZ. Actually best Persian food even if you want to compare LA, SF & Vegas."}
{"text":"The food and ambience was great. Perfect barg. Great tahdig. However, after poor service and refusing to accept gift cards from costco this restaurant barely deserves one star. The manager, Eric Peek, was a true joke and embarrasses the food, the other servers and the restaurant. His unprofessional approach truly ruined my brother's birthday dinner. He flat out lied and did not let me read the terms from the back of the gift card which make it clear they can be used like cash. I would not recommend this restaurant solely based off of the mistreatment by management. By the way, costco was very surprised to hear the cards were not accepted as if they were cash and will be following up on the issue."}
{"text":"Raheem is one of the best servers in the establishment! He knows how to take care the guests and serves with confidence and makes the dining experience so much fun and enjoyable! The food is always consistent and delicious!"}
{"text":"For my big 100th review I wanted to write about some place special, and this was the place! This is hands down some of the best Persian food I've had in a while (my favorite place is Hen House in Irvine, CA... but this place comes very close!)

First of all, walking in through the glass double doors you feel like you're dining with royalty as the restaurant entry has a beautiful staircase and the walls and floors are decked with red and gold Persian tapestry, curtains and rugs. Love the vibe, it can be considered a nice place to bring the family or a date. But there were definitely many families there the night we went. Service was impeccable even thought it was busy, our waitress Nicole was very sweet and attentive! Now on to the food...

My friends were visiting from California and we had spent the whole day eating around Scottsdale and I had been forewarned about the large serving sizes so we knew to order little. Still, the three of us ended up ordering a Kashk O'Bademjan, Osh E'Reshteh, and a Beef and Chicken Koobideh a la carte... Wow, I'm actually drooling right now! The Kashk for those who don't know is like a roasted eggplant spread with whey and topped with fried onions. It typically has a little bit of yogurt in it to make it creamier (and in my opinion, tastier). The kashk here didn't have much yogurt, if any so it had a more concentrated eggplant flavor. I actually think it tasted more like curried eggplant, but regardless it was delicious! The Ash was also delicious, very hearty with all the vegetables and easy on the noodles (which I prefer). It was thick enough to put on our plate and eat with pita rather than eat it as a soup. The koobideh was BOMB, I prefer the ground meat to steak because its easier to eat and absorbs a lot more flavor, but it really depends on my mood. But both the chicken and beef were flavorful and moist. We quickly ran out of pita bread so decided to order a side of rice (haha we really should just have ordered an entree) and it was a huge serving! We had to order another koobideh just so we could take it home as leftovers mmm..The meal came with a plate of basil, cilantro and raw onion as well. I love to tear up the raw basil and mix it in with my rice and top it all off with the sumac they leave on every table. Overall, I thought the food was excellent :D

Prices were perfect for the amount of food you get! For 3 people and 2 alc. drinks, Osh, Kashk Obadmejan, 3 koobideh, a side of rice and a side of Tahini bill came out to 52 bucks. And we went home with plenty of left overs!

I guess the only downside I saw was that the bathroom was tiny for such a big restaurant! They should really try to make it bigger because I had to wait in line a while; they has 2 stalls. 

Other than that I enjoyed the food and the vibe and I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As Arnold says, \"I'll be back.\" Great experience culturally and an adventure for my taste buds. Portions are ginormous. Got the chicken and Mahi combo for two. Fulfilling  for dinner and enough for leftovers. Service was good and food was piping hot off the grill. Seasoning was special and on point. Next time I need to leave room to try dessert."}
{"text":"Paradise on a platter!

Decor is well thought out, semi-residential.  But quaint.  

Service was terrific.  Our waitress found out that we were first timers and was happy to explain the entrees.  All items are adaptable to your taste/desire.  Mix-match as you wish.
A water glass never went empty and you didn't have a chance to consider if you were in need of something because she was already on it or asking.

Portions are Gi-normous!!!  Picky eaters or dietary considerations?  No worries.  There are plenty of vegetarian options, gluten-free options.  

Yes.  I am gluttonous.  I had appetizers, entree, and of course dessert.
Greek salad, pitas with yogurt and cucumber dip, veg kebob with ados polo, baklava, and persian ice cream.  I would do it all again....everyday if I could"}
{"text":"Persian room outstanding customer service, outstanding food, beautiful and gorgeous place. If I have any special occasions I will only come here."}
{"text":"This is the exemplar for Mediterranean food.

The building, decorations and interior were well appointed and yet still comfortable.

Of course without the food looks are useless.

And food is where Persian shined!"}
{"text":"Went there New Year's Eve and had a miserable time. Packed in like sardines. They asked about the sample meat trays and we said medium towards rare. The trays were all well to very well done and dry, topped off with a half tray of dry rice. As soon as we put the forks down they asked if we wanted to box the rest while the platter was hardly touched. Then we said no and they would go to the other end of the table and asked if they wanted it boxed. The owner then came over and picked up my dish without asking . I felt that if we were Persian, we would of gotten treated with a little more respect. Never again"}
{"text":"Best tasting food and incredible service!! Love this place so much we had them cater our wedding this last Saturday and it was amazing!! All 200 guests were blown away by how good the food was!"}
{"text":"Warning: I did not take pictures because the food was so so delicious!! I've been here twice now and have left full and happy each time. 

Food: Appetizers included the pita bread. I would recommend putting butter on this along with the fresh basil that they provide. Dolmas: oh. My. Hummus: 10/10. Dinner: We got the Persian combination platter (that serves 2) which has steak, lamb, and grilled chicken with rice. It's huge servings so we both ate to our satisfaction and had left overs. The service has been on point. 

Drinks: we got wine tonight. We had the Pinot noir and merlot (alias was the name for both) that were amazing.

Service: always very accommodating and we felt like we were the only table in the whole restaurant because of how attentive they were. 

10/10 would recommend that you bring you and your whole family BUT make a reservation to avoid long wait times."}
{"text":"We sat down for dinner and immediately gave us water, so far so good.  Then came the basil/onion/butter plate but on the plate was a piece of chewed chewing gum!!  It appears they had that same plate  on another table at one time, and since it appeared untouched they gave the same plate with onions etc on it not noticing the gum!!!!  Disgusting.  I question the cleanliness of The Persian Room.  I know they get busy at times but tonight was the 4th of July and it wasn't as busy as usual.  When we showed them the gum they just took it away, brought another \"fresh\" plate of basil/onion/butter and acted like it wasn't a big deal!  We decided not to eat there or anywhere.  We were all too grossed out."}
{"text":"In my opinion the Persian Room is the best Persian restaurant in the valley but not quite up to par with the Persian food available in Orange County and Los Angeles. I have been here a couple of times so far and always enjoy what I order. 

We had dinner there last weekend and we ordered the Tah Dig appetizer with Fessenjen- picture a large platter of crispy rice topped with a stew of pomegranate and walnut sauce combined with chicken. This was probably the highlight of the meal. We also shared the Persian Room Special (a platter or rice, filet and chicken with two grilled tomatoes. The meat was quiet good but I find the rice to be somewhat lacking flavor compared to what I am used to. We had the saffron ice cream for dessert which was good but not super exciting. 

I am sure we will be back as it is the best Phoenix has to offer."}
{"text":"Great food and cozyy ambience! We went here for my Mom's birthday. We all liked the food and service. Chicken kabobs were amazingly tasty and the bread was super soft - my toddler son loved it as well! Except the baklawa, everything was delicious. I would certainly visit this place again. Great for a family dinner!"}
{"text":"Took my little sister for her 17th birthday and invited her friends! Great time food was great! Service was awesome too"}
{"text":"My favorite Persian Restaurant in the country! 

To start you have to have fresh bread baked in front of you to compliment the cooked eggplant! 

Let me tell you that the rice is the most fluffy and tasty you will ever get! The chicken is so tender and juicy and with a little lemon it turns into the best you could get in AZ. The best part is the red meat.... The Barg Filet is so amazing it's juicy and tender you can cut with a fork! The kebab is a melt in your mouth no need to chew deal!  

I always end my meals here with some tea to help digest all the food I have consumed! The portions here are magnanimous! Come hungry cause thy will feed you right!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a pleasant lunch at the Persian Room with a friend who suggested an exotic dining experience. First time here but have heard good things about it. Not crowded on Friday at 1:00. 

Waiter seemed to be in a hurry to get our order in but we slowed it down to enjoy the food and ambiance. We were served a freshly baked bread with fresh basal, butter and onion to clear your palate.

We both ordered the lamb shanks. Each plate contained one large lamb shank stewed in a fragrant broth. The plate had a large porton of rice mixed with herbs and fava beans with a small dinner salad. The lamb was very tender and tasty. Was looking for more but portion size was accetable. 

Finished off the meal withTurkish coffee and friend had desert. Turkish coffee was good if you like thick expresso...who needs those canned energy drinks.

Nice leisurely lunch, good food and service. Reasonable price for the location and ambience. Still have a buzz from that Turkish Coffee."}
{"text":"OK food. I've had much better in west Los Angeles for for cheaper prices. Their chicken could be day and their chicken skewers were not that fresh. Their rice was lukewarm and not steaming hot and not fresh. I was glad to get the pomegranate walnut sauce with rice ."}
{"text":"Amazing food.   I never had Persian/Iranian food before and I am simply amazed at how good this food is. The dining room is very pretty and the service is great"}
{"text":"First of all, the dinner portions are HUGE at Persian Room - definitely enough for two people to share or to take home for lunch. The food was good, but pretty salty. I came here with a large group and it was very easy to make a reservation online, even on the day of. The dining rooms are large and can definitely accommodate groups - even reservations, which is a plus.

However, the service was very slow and the servers were pretty disorganized and seemed openly frustrated. I understand that it can be frustrating when orders get mixed up, but I've been to plenty of restaurants where servers stay organized with groups, making notes and maintaining a pleasant demeanor. I would have expected a bit better service and preparation, considering that this place lets you make reservations for large groups online. 

It could have just been a bad night for them, but I've heard similar experiences from smaller groups that dined there. I would come back again for the food, but I might choose to call ahead for takeout."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night and it was my first visit. The service was terrible, I had to get up to ask for drink refills, had to chase someone down to pay our bill and my food was terrible. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to The Persian Room today.  This is sort of a belated Valentine's Day.  Both of had agreed to postpone the Valentine's dinner from Thursday to Saturday.  Both of us work nearly 12 hours a day at our jobs.

We went to the Persian Room 02/16/2013 to find it quite busy.  Thank goodness we had a reservation.  We would have been waiting some time otherwise.  

We ordered the following:

Torshi (kind of a pickled vegetable salad with wine vinegar)
Hommus with Eggplant delight (a dip)

Lamb and chicken combination dinner (for 2)...included koubideh


The torshi was good, but found it a bit sour. 

Hommus was very good.  

The lamb and chicken combination was very good and very heavy.  My wife and I were able to bring a lot of it home simply because we were not able to finish it.  The portion size was pretty big.  

We really enjoyed the food.  The inside of the restaurant looks like it is classy.  We have eaten at a lot of restaurants that specialize in Middle Eastern cuisine.  This is definitely one of them that ranks as the most classy.  I would definitely recommend this to others.  

Also look at the Caspian Market next door."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times and it is always fantastic. The lamb loin is a must. The rice that it comes with (adas polo) is safron infused with dates, lentils and raisins. A bite with all of the components of the rice and a piece of the magnificent tender lamb is one of life's perfect bites. We have tried many appetizers, stews and entres and have not been disappointed yet. Don't pass up the fresh pita and herbs they put on the table when you sit down. They are truly better than they should be. This certainly worth a try if you are in town"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been talking about going here and decided to make a go of it for our birthdays.  First of all we went on a Saturday night.  We made reservations via Open Table.  When we got to the restaurant don't let the exterior fool you. The location is tucked away in the corner of a small plaza. But when you walk into the place you would never know how big it is just by passing by.  It's two stories actually.  

Our Persian experience was started with a basket of fresh Persian bread and basil, mint, and white onions.  I could smell the Persian bread being baked and it was so good.  Very similar to a tortilla or lavash.  We then ordered the yogurt and cucumber dip and that was tasty as well.  You got a nice size serving and accompanied us into our meal.  

Next we move on to our meals.  What to chose?  What to chose?  They have single serving entrees and entrees for two and three.  Very reasonably priced as well.  We ordered the number 50 and my girlfriend and her husband ordered number 51.  Number 50 is a combination of beef and chicken shish and koobideh.  Number 51 is a combination of lamb shish, chicken filet, and koobideh.  Both platters came with and huge serving of basmati rice and grilled tomatoes.  

For dessert we wanted to finish off the meal with a Persian delight.  We are both Greek and opted not to go for the baklava or cheesecake since we can get those anywhere. We asked our waitress for a recommendation and she suggested the Persian ice cream.  It was ok.  The flavor was very different.  It's was vanilla ice cream with something else in it that was a very different flavor.  I don't know if I'll order that again.  

In closing I have to say that I would jump on the chance to come here again.  It was worth the hour drive from Gilbert.  The place was packed and people were waiting for tables.  The other thing that I really appreciated is that we were not rushed through our night.  I loved that.  And as I looked around all the other tables were not rushed either.  So many restaurants you go to anymore are into turning tables.  Get them in and get them out.  I didn't feel that way at all here.  One final comment.  Both my husband and I commented on the fact that neither one of us felt bloated after our meal.  All too often we go out and eat and feel so miserable afterwards from the traditionally commercially prepared menus.  This was a true \"feel good\" meal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Couldn't wait to visit Phoenix again to eat at this place again! Great authentic food. No matter what you pick, it should be so darn good!!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Be sure to make a reservation, it gets crowded."}
{"text":"it was just ok, I was expecting lots more,  Have a greek friend that cooks outstanding food, so guess I compare to his, We went there for our anniversary, had been looking forward to this place for months, probably will not go again, could use some updating."}
{"text":"You know you're having authentic Middle Eastern food when it is packed on a Monday night at 9pm, and we were the only white people! For a second i thought i was in another country instead of Phoenix. Incredible attention to detail in the decorating. The food was amazing and staff was very helpful. I can't wait to go back. As others have said on here, this is a place where you should dress up a little."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an amazing dinner here last night. We had a group of 25 to celebrate my friend`s recent marathon run and Persian Room was the perfect place! The have upstairs and downstairs dining, we were upstairs. The only drawback is the restrooms are downstairs and very tiny, plus one stall! (Was surprised at that)

More importantly the food and service. I was told they have outstanding hummus and this turned out to be very true!! The entrees are huge, I ended up half mine home. I ordered the chicked shish with half basmati rice/half salad. Chicken was succulent and just the right amount of spices. Great place and atmosphere over all, we really had a great time here!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Scottsdale while on a road-trip and was craving for some good food and Persian Room catered to that brilliantly. The setup of the place is really nice and we were seated promptly. The Pita bread along with fresh onions and lentils was amazing but be sure you don't binge on it as the entrees are of massive portions. I selected a Lamb Loin entree and I really liked it. The meat ( in my opinion ) was cooked the right amount and had good flavors going with it. I would however suggest you look at the rice you want with it - the standard saffron rice with dates and resins could get overwhelming after a while. The amount of food you get can easily fill you up ! ( I was super hungry but could only manage to finish half of it but it made for pretty good leftovers ! ) .. My brother and his fiancé ordered chicken entrées and they were delicious too. For dessert we ordered Baklava with ice cream ( again it had a huge helping of ice cream ) .. The ice cream had a really nice flavour with pistachio crumbs in it. Overall the dining experience was excellent and we left the place feeling extremely full and satisfied !"}
{"text":"Just ate the leftovers from my visit last night...yum!  This was my second visit to the Persian Room and turns out the first wonderful experience over a year ago  was not a fluke.  The portions are very large, plenty for two to split and still feel full.  I was in a party of six and we had the pleasure of sampling each other's meals.  

We started with appetizers.  I could see myself going there just to get them.  The dolmehs (stuffed grape leaves) were delicious, the hummus was creamy and had well balanced flavors.  The yogurt & cucumber dip was refreshing (love the bits of currants!)  I especially enjoyed the hummus and eggplant delight.  And of course the fresh hand-made pita is something to cherish!

The meal was super tasty.  My husband had the lamb and loved it (I don't care for lamb.)  I had a combination meal filet and beef koobideh and it was very good.  Strangely though, the filet was cold when I got it.  Another person in our party had the same issue with their filet.  He sent it back, but I decided since I was not going to finish the meal until today I would just pack the filet and eat the koobideh.  The waitress was very nice and accommodating and got the food back to my friend quickly and at the preferred temperature.  As for my filet...it was even more scrumptious this afternoon.  Next time I'll try the chicken barg or chicken shish because someone gave me a chunk of their's and it was tender and flavorful. 

We all had the Persian ice cream and baklava for dessert.  They are both made in house and well-made.  The flavor of the ice cream is unique and memorable.  The baklava was not overly sweet and was perfectly flaky.  What a way to end an already wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Pretty simple but yet so good. I got the combination of chicken barg kebab and koobideh. Very good! Even the rice. The pita basil and onion thing they give you as you wait for your food was addicting. Will come back sometime! Server wasn't that nice, maybe our waitress just had a bad day but besides that definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We've been dining here periodically since 2002.  We ate here again on 7/16/11 and enjoyed it as usual.

From experience, we know that the portions are large, so we opted for two meals and an appetizer this time.  Tried the Kash O'bademjan for an appetizer for the first time.  It is a mixture of roasted eggplant and whey, flavored with sauteed garlic, onions & mint.  It is served hot with plenty of hot pita bread.  It is very flavorful and we loved the roasted garlic garnishing it and would love to have had more of it!!
We shared the Chicken Filet Sultani which has a skewer of tender marinated  chicken breast and a skewer of koobideh.   Both very flavorful, tender and moist.  We also ordered the Gyros beef which was excellent.  The homemade gyros sauce was outstanding; very creamy and an excellent compliment to the spicy gyros beef. Of course, a huge platter of delectable long grain basmati rice accompanied the meats.  Their rice is truly lovely; definitely some butter swimming lovingly through it along with saffron.  Excellent rice!

Another nice meal at the Persian Room.  And we had enough to take home for a second (but lighter) go round today!  Yum!

I don't think it earned a 5 stars this time as the men's restroom (according to my spouse) needed some serious attention and the timing of the food delivery was slightly off.  We received our main meat dish before they had delivered our dinner plates which we needed since we were dining family style.  The platter of rice was about 2 minutes later arriving than our dinner plates."}
{"text":"Always consistently good with terrific service.  Everything is fresh and cooked to order."}
{"text":"Great food and large portions. Hard to fit it all on the table- but a great feast!  Chicken kabob and appetizers are delicious  We also enjoyed the fesenjan (stewed chicken in pomegranate/walnut sauce).

Ambiance is very nice and a departure from most Scottsdale restaurants.  Though, odd music on my last two visits there."}
{"text":"I guess I'm not an expert on Persian food, but I really enjoy eating at the Persian Room!  The atmosphere is great, the food is excellent and the portions are incredibly huge.  

I don't remember the names of the dishes, but the Koobideh is one of my favorites - it's ground beef with onions and herbs mixed in.  Very, very tasty and not too expensive.

If I have any complaints it's the unevenness of the wait staff.  Some of the waiters/waitresses are fantastic, but a number of them are kind of surly and unpleasant.  However, we've always received our food in a timely manner and haven't ever had any serious issues.

There's rarely a wait which is a huge plus on Friday or Saturday night in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"They were jam packed for Father's Day dinner. Had a reservation but still ended up waiting 10 minutes. Not a big deal. The wait staff looked overworked and not very happy to be working tonight. Also understandable because people waiting for tables were taking over their work area. As big as this restaurant is, they really don't have wait area set up properly. No chairs or designated area separating from work area. 
Once we were seated, the service was slow. We ordered our food and by the time food came, we were starving. They also forgot our appetizer and kept asking if we wanted to cancel the order. We had to insist on getting our hummus appetizer 3 times. Oh boy! 
The hummus and the homemade pita bread was really tasty. The pita had nice chewiness which I hadn't had anywhere else. 
We were so hungry I only had patience to take only one picture, but have to say, their lamb was really fresh and tasty. It was perfect seasoning for me, not overpowering the meat so that you can really taste the meat. The lamb wasn't gamey at all. The rack of lamb has to be my favorite out of all the meats we tried. The rice that came with our meal wasn't too memorable. 
Overall, had nice meal. The service I'm going to assume it was due to Father's Day craziness."}
{"text":"We went with another couple who have been here before and who are Egyptian so they were familiar with the menu items. We had them choose what we should order and everything was very tasty.  Since the entrees are very large we decided not to get an appetizer and just started with their fresh baked  pita bread that you make like a taco with the combo of yellow onion and basil. Very different and tasty. We shared the entrees and had the beef shish kebab and the barg. With both the beef tenderloin was medium rare and very tender with a unique blend of mild spices. We also shared 2 lamb dishes. Lamb shanks in a delicious curry broth, very flavorful  and fall off the bone tender and lamb shish kebab also tasty and tender but a little dry. They serve you enough rice per entree to feed a small army. We tried 3 types of basmati rice all were very good and you just can't stop eating it. We also enjoyed the yogurt made with cucumber and green onion that you can add to the meat or rice dishes. I ordered the sangria and it was very good not overly sweet but very tasty. For dessert we shared a couple of baklava which were excellent with Turkish coffees which were perfect. Service was okay, servers weren't highly experienced as was easily noticed by their lack of technique when placing the orders on the table and showed in how slow they were in responding to requests. Possibly they were short-handed because it was very busy."}
{"text":"Amazing food, consistency, and ambience! I've been coming here for over 10 years. I'm 1/2 Persian and can vouch for the efficacy of the cuisine. Anyone who likes quality Mediterranean will love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the amount of food you received for the price was unreal! The place gets quite busy so I would recommend reservations. I was dining alone so I was able to get a table quickly. 

I ordered the yogurt dip as well as a chicken plate. It was absolutely enough for two or maybe 3 people. The ambiance of the restaurant was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I tried this place once not a Sunday. Food was really bad. Dishes were warmed in microwave and was still cold . We brought it up to server restaurant manager didn't even bother to comets our table  and explain. Last time ever."}
{"text":"I wanted this to be great. I love Persian food. And the food here is really good. And I would totally eat it again, if it was not for having to go to the actual restaurant to eat. The service was so below par that it was actually hilarious. First, we were greeted and seated quickly. Which was very nice and the hostess was very polite. So far so good. Then we were told our waiter would be right with us. So we waited....

and waited....

waited........

finally, my friend asked a waiter that we would like to order. But this boorish lady with a Russian accent said \"I will will get him\". First, why do you need to get him. You were folding napkins (slowly, I might add) before we called you over. You could have taken our order and then told our waiter. Or at least, said with a nicer tone. I felt like we had just signed the death warrant for our waiter. And when she arrived, she was very pleasant and apologized for the wait. We ordered our meals and drinks. My beer and my other friend's ice tea arrived quickly. But my other friend's wine just didnt arrive. The excuse we got was \"we don't have a bartender tonight, the manager is finding it\".  Then she left. And we never saw her again. Our appetizer arrived and our main courses. But still no wine! Finally, we got someone over here, just for them to run off to get the manager. So another guy arrives and we get the wine. By the time, he poured the glasses, he was already gone from the table. And no surprise because the wine was bad. 

Then as we chatted, with plates just sitting in front of us. And that Russian mob woman back to her napkins. 

Then the \"manager\" arrived with our check. And told us our waitress had to leave. See what I told you?! Totally signed her death warrant with that Russian mob lady. 

No apologies, no nothing. So while the food was good. I would just stay away, I mean the restaurant was half empty when we went and it was midweek. I can not imagine this place when it is busy.

So two stars because the food was great but just like how one F can ruin your GPA, the service just ruined it for us."}
{"text":"We went to the Persian Room for lunch yesterday. The restaurant was beautiful and clean, the service was great, the lunch portions were huge and best of call the food was excellent. All four of us had different entree and all were excellent. 

I'm grateful I don't live near the place as I guarantee I would eat there every week. This is a must return restaurant.  Prices were very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Good food ! worst staff ! Worst service! Manager does not take any of customers concerns ! Terribly rude! All he cares about is money !  Food is not halal to those  who cares , but they still say so !  Manager has to be changed ! 
 waiters some are really nice and some just like their rude boss !"}
{"text":"I remember casually hearing about The Persian Room a few years back and never put it on my list .. My husband where on our way to a different restaurant and I opened my Yelp App to see what else was in the area and decided to try something new. Boy am I glad we took the detour! We arrived around 7:00 PM couldn't get immediate seating, so we sat at the bar .  I love sitting at the bar because you tend to get more attention. The bartender educated us on how to order and even gave us yummy suggestions for leftovers .  We started off with the complementary wood fired house made naan , that was served with fresh cilantro , basil, onion and butter on the side to top on your bread with . It was happy hour until 8PM, so we ordered Hummus and Tzatziki (that was  1/2 off), both are really good and highly recommended.   We shared the taste of Persia for two ; the plate came on this gorgeous silver platter with enough food for four (I guess that's the Persian way of eating) , three kabobs (filet , chicken and a ground beef) a huge side of rice and a side salad of finely chopped tomato , cucumber and onion with lemon vinaigrette. The kabobs were so tender you can cut it up with a fork, the rice and salad was amazing too.  I was really impressed with the food and our whole experience , I plan to bring out of town guest for a cool experience . This is the perfect place to share family style."}
{"text":"I do not get what the hype is about.  My entrée came out 10 mins before my wife's, the food is mostly rice, and the food couldn't be more bland if they tried.  The lamb I had was flavorless...no joke....like it was marinated in water.  Glad I had a groupon, cause full price and I might have said something.  This place seems more like a tourist trap...save your money!"}
{"text":"Just back from New Year Day meal.
As usual, food was great. If I were rating food and value, they get a 4 or 5 star. 
My issue is with the Mgr.
Arrived, party of 4 adults, at 3 pm for early dinner. Mgr must hate his job, if his demeanor
tells the story. I told him I had tried to make reservations, but girl who answered phone said they did not take them. He said they do, but blah blah blah.
Took us to back room, next to party of nearly 20, at least 6 of which were little kids.
Long story short, kids having a good time, mother's not controlling behavior, we could not even hear to order. Mgr came over after I complained to waitress, said blah blah blah.
No apology, no comp, no concern.
Been coming here for 20 years.
Because of mgrs. Attitude, this was last time. Will be advising anyone that asks what our experience was like."}
{"text":"Sometimes the best things are right under your nose.  I have been driving by the Persian Room for years and last night was the first time I tried it.  How could I miss such a lively and delicious restaurant?  We had a reservation and were seated right away.  This is a busy place- the decor is loud and so is the restaurant itself, but in a fun,energizing way. Service was fantastic.  They bring every table the herb, onion, pita/bread for a starter.   What a flavorful combination! Since it was our first time we had the server recommend dishes and she did a great job. We ordered the appetizer platter which was scrumptious! I can't wait to go back for this. There were four of us and we ate everything but the platter itself.  The hummus is so creamy and good and the dolmeh does not disappoint. For dinner we had the cornish, the chicken filet, and the beef sultani.  Everything is beautifully arranged on one large platter and accompanied by the fluffiest rice. Of course I was full, but who can pass up baklava!  It was just divine.   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent, tasty variety.  We had the tour of Persia Combo. Plenty for 4 people. Service always outstanding. We are frequent customers and have never been disappointed. Great place to take out of town guests for something besides Mexican."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and amazing tasting food. Make sure to get the eggplant appetizer with fresh bread"}
{"text":"I would have to say my first encounter with Persian cuisine was a success and satisfying, but this great feast would have not been possible without a few handful of other foodie friends.  We met up to help kick-off a special occasion.

For starters, we had this interesting blend of hummus and sauteed eggplant accompanied by these soft flour tortilla-like bread used for dipping.  

For the entree, I ordered this basic meat dish called the Naderi Sultani which consist of chicken tenders on skewers, marinated filet mignon, and Koobideh (ground beef that had been prepared like a sausage link without the clear casing).  All of that came with a generous pile of non-sticky, very long grain rice that I personally have never seen before.  Due to it's soft and light texture, forking into it was effortless.  The flavor was slightly enhanced by this buttery, oily drizzle.  This particular dish is easily 2 persons serving!

While I managed to finish half of my dish, I had to sample some of my friends' entrees, the specially, seasoned baked chicken and stewed lamb shank.  Both were really tender and flavorful and had that pulled from the bone goodness.  A key note to take in is that most, if not all, of the dishes come with some kind of rice, preparation may vary from dish to dish.

Dessert was not an option after all of that meat and rice!  If I ever make my way back, I would definitely order less.  A good suggestion is to order 1 plate less the number of people in your party.  Depending on the dish, the proportion can be a bit overwhelming, some is 2, 1.5, or 1 person serving.

Our server was attentive to our needs and kindly clarified on our questionable dishes.  When entering the main lobby area, you are immediately confronted by a long, beautiful stairway that leads to the top of the restaurant, which is their \"private\" section where we sat.  The decor is elegant Arabic with some Ancient artwork near the top of the ceiling where it's best viewed in the private area.  One could even describe it as a place where Aladdin and Princess Jasmine would dine at.

Overall, if you like steak and potatoes, your going to like Arabic meat and rice.  While it does have its unique and distinct flavors, \"normal\" taste buds will not have too much of a fuss here."}
{"text":"This review is for service of management and waitress only. The wait to be seated was not bad however it took them 1 hour to take our order and another 45-50 minutes just to get our food. The management did no effort to get our order much sooner and get the order out. If you have time to waste then this is your place. Otherwise there are other Persian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a real gem in North Scottsdale. The Persian room is a breath of fresh air in a city that is dominated by American and Mexican cuisine. I have been to the Persian room twice over the past couple of months and the portions were large and the food was fresh. 

For people who are not accustomed to Persian food I would recommend  the koobideh (which is a ground beef dish) or the steak kebab.  For an appetizer I would recommend the humus - it was amazing!

The only downside to the entire restaurant is the rolling chairs. Personally, I have never seen chairs with wheels at a fine dinning establishment, but to me this is a very minor negative."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch. The food is delicious and plentiful. $16 sultani is the best.  Atmosphere is nice with music, decorations, as well with a small inside fountain."}
{"text":"If you want a TON of food (tasty, authentic food at that), then you must give this place a try!  I highly recommend splitting with someone because they will bring out a platter as big as a serving tray packed with rice and meat.  I kid you not."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and the service is great! It is expensive but the serving sizes are huge so I guess that makes up for the amount you pay. The room is not brightly lit so you kinda can't see everything but it's got a romantic feel to it."}
{"text":"We would love to thank the wonderful service we have had here. This was our first time dining here and everything was great from walking in up to when we left. The meal was delicious especially being this was something different for us. 

We could not have asked for a better waitress on our first visit. Nicole was very helpful, friendly, most of all attentive to our table on top of all other tables she had this night. It's because of her service that we cannot wait to return soon! And I hope that we can ask for her on our next time. 

Nicole please keep up the great service it's because of your that people keep coming back! This night was my birthday and I could not have been happier! 

Thank you staff!
The Persian Room is my to go to now
And must recommend to others!"}
{"text":"April 2014 International Supper Club UYE (#ISCUYE) met here for dinner.  This was the anniversary of Monica O and I organizing the Yelp PHX International Supper Club and I'm so happy that we come here.  


AFter a couple  of minutes, we were greeted at the front door and seated at an upstairs table - conveniently located next to the bar.  Kudos to the Persian Room for being THE restaurant with the BEST and most ATTENTIVE service in the 13 months that our group has been meeting.  We usually have from about 15- 30 people to attend.  IN this case, we were some place in the middle.  A large group that was waited on by 3 very attentive people.  I liked this - A LOT.  3 people helped to make things go more smoothly and efficiently. I can't say enough about how happy I was with the quality of their service.  In addition to our large party, there was another large birthday party in the downstairs dining room that was being seated at the time that we were being seated.  This is an awesome place for a large party.

Their happy hour lasts until about 7 or 7:30(Insanely late), so I am pretty sure that most of us ordered more than expected because all of their appetizers are half price during the happy hour.  I ordered a very delicious Chicken eggplant borani as my appetizer and shared it with the table.  Several others ordered appetizers and shared too.  My favorite was the Yogurt and Garlic Dip.  YIKES.  That stuff was great.  Becca H ordered that and she was sitting right beside me.  I felt like a little kid sneaking someone's food.  I just kept dipping in her Yogurt/Garlic Dip.  (LOL - TWSS).

I ordered a small side salad for my main course since the Chicken Eggplant Borani was enough to feed an army.  The side salad was just fine.  

This also happened to be 2nd least expensive #ISCUYE!  I was happy with that.

My return factor for this place is 90%."}
