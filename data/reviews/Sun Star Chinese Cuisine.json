{"text":"went for my first visit here this evening.  it's a bit hidden (at the same plaza as \"Maxim cafe\").  ordered \"shrimp with lobster sauce\" and cost $10.99 taxes.  The take-out container was a bit on the smaller size and shrimps were on the smaller size as well.  a bit surprized by that since it's supposedly a 'seafood chinese restaurant'.  tasted good none the less.  May go back there one day to try a difference dish for \"speedy\" take-out if i happen to be in the area....but i wouldn't choose this place to meet up with groups of friends..."}
{"text":"My worst dining experience in Toronto. I ordered two dishes both of them were subpar at best.   The seafood with mixed vegetables literally had two pieces of shrimp and one piece of scallop there were only 2-3 pieces of carrots the rest was bok choy. It was very disappointing.   The other dish was Gen. Tso chicken this had very little chicken most of  it was just breaded and covered in sauce.   I just feel like this restaurant is trying to get away with serving meals with no sustenance ie no meat no real vegetables.  The service was pretty horrible too .The waitress was just sitting around talking on the phone and occasionally  would be screaming screaming with the staff in the back. I will never be coming back to this restaurant ever!"}
{"text":"For us, it is a take-out restaurant.  We will pack lots of dishes away.   Some of the dishes are not available every night but also has a limited quantity if available.  The yam duck is one of them and is done very deliciously.  The fish tail fin is another such dishes. With the tofu soaked in the sauces mixed with the fish, it is one of a kind, though it has nothing to do with fins.    This restaurant has less salt and less oil if you such ordered.  At least after the meal you won't feel thirsty.    The service is average and don't expect much.  Make your decision before ordering or the waitresses will be too busy to wait for you and will come back later."}
{"text":"The server could hardly speak r understand English. I really resent this because I have been living in the neighborhood for over 40 years. We orderd general Tao chicken. I dont know what they cooked because it was hard and I dont think there was any chicken in the batter."}
{"text":"We haven't been here in awhile, simply because of all the very good chinese restaurants in Scarborough/Markham/Richmond Hill.  But if you're nearby and don't want to drive too far, then SunStar will be fine for your simple cantonese fare.  The best dishes seem to be the stir fried variety (fried chicken with bits of garlic, shrimp with shells in superior soy, most veggies).  But their deep fried dishes are a bit lacking and not crunchy enough despite the batter they use (sweet n sour pork, small fishes).  Free soup, but no dessert.  Most dishes are on the smaller size portions, compared to most other cantonese places in the other areas I mentioned above."}
{"text":"?????!!!???????????????????????????? First time to this place. I ordered pork neck meat with mushroom, fried chicken Tempeh (????)and fried veggie."}
{"text":"We drove by this plaza on our way to conger Wong and saw the sign for this place  and decided to check it out, and was pleasantly surprised!  If you are looking for a upscale, romantic dining experience, please don't come here cuz you will be disappointed, but if you are like me looking for authentic, Hong Kong style \"small-fry\" dishes chinese cooking, then you've come to the right place.   When you walk into this place, it's like walking into a typical corner cafe in Hong Kong,  very cramped and very busy. Cooking style is also very hk oriented ( not the north American chinese cuisine style with the chop suey  crap)  pricing is pretty decent with many dishes under $10 and food comes out quick and tasty.   We ordered the beef tenderloin with honey pepper sauce which was extremely tender and not too \"honey-ey\" and the chicken with dry onion which was perfectly spiced yet still juicy. All in all a no - fail dinner that leaves you perfectly satisfied with a hint of still wanting more.  Usually to get this caliber of hk cuisine we would need to go either Markham or deep within Scarborough, its nice to see a place like sun star located conveniently in North York for those of us living in the area,"}
{"text":"I live super close to this restaurant and I've been wanting to try it for months now !  Was a bit disappointing but only because of the General Tao \"chicken\". Why is \"chicken\" in quotes, you ask?  Well, because I'm not convinced it is chicken. I have attached a few photos of said mystery meat so you may see for yourself. I cut up a bunch of pieces in a desperate effort to find one edible bite, but wasn't so lucky.  I also orders vegetable fried rice, broccoli with garlic, and veggie spring rolls which were all AWESOME.  That being said, because of the mystery meat disappointment, I must only give 3 stars (should I give an extra pity star...?). No!  If you tasted the chewy mystery meat for yourself you would understand.   Anyways, I'm not sure I'll be back. It doesn't seem like a place I can go to complain, and $10 for inedible chewy General Tao \"chicken\" is just not okay in my world."}
{"text":"A very popular Cantonese seafood restaurant, clientele is predominantly HK Chinese.  Lots of regulars, which speaks volume for its food quality and consistency.  It's not exactly a hole-in-wall, but not much more either.    They have a Live fish tank, so you can order fish, Vancouver crabs, lobsters and usually some type of clams or scallops or whatever they have in the tank, and specify how you like it cooked.  Wait staff can often give you recommendation, if you ask.   We've had all sorts of seafood dishes, stir fried greens (usually pea plant tips or tong choy), rice dishes in clay pot, etc.  Usually well done, seasoned on the light side (not too salty or greasy) compared to Northern Chinese.    Service is, well, typical Chinese restaurant.  You come here for the food.   Make reservation for weekend dinners or be prepared to wait.   We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The tilapia fish was so awesome.  I would like to go back and have it again.  I highly recommend having the white fish that is swimming inside the aquarium fish tank."}
{"text":"Pretty standard, but really not bad. Came at lunch. Quite quiet.   Had:  Oyster congee, Chiu Chow style ($7.99) - There were oysters, but more minced pork and Chinese shitake mushroom than oyster. A tad bland for my liking.   Shredded pork chow mein ($7.99) - I think that's how much it was. We specifically asked for it to be extra crispy. We asked that they separate the sauce from the noodles so the noodles would be crispier. The lady said that they already crisp up both sides of the noodles. Fine. We'll take the sauce on top then. When we got our noodles, we found out the lady wasn't wrong. The noodles were crispy on both sides, and only the sides, leaving the majority of the noodles on the inside not crispy. Not cool.  Boiled Chinese veggie - No idea how much this one was. The choy sum was very thick, and a tad stringy. Lovely green color though (supposedly from boiling it in the noodle water?).  Deep fried dough stick - super crispy. Good stuff.  The Oyster congee and the shredded pork chow mein were lunch specials. I can't remember what the dinner prices are.  A tad out of the way. I might come back."}
{"text":"We went there on 17 February 2018 and it was your second visit there in over a year.  The food was still excellent but the server was still not very friendly.  I had the Chicken Congee and my husband had the Beef Congee, each were $4.50 so price wise, it's not bad."}
{"text":"I'm a northern Chinese gal so canto food is not my go-to, but I can still appreciate a good crispy chicken or stir fry/rice dish once in a while. This place reminded me of typical small canto places but didn't really stand out.  Had the crispy half chicken, steamed tilapia, braised egg plant, and saucy pork chops... The dishes tended to be smaller in portion compared to what I'm used to. The braised egg plant was not seared so the texture was overall too mushy. Pork chops were delicious and probably my fav.   I like how they start out the meal with house pork bone soup."}
{"text":"If you don't speak Chinese, don't order here. The waiters are rude and entitled to big tips."}
{"text":"Fung sai Gai is pretty good here, crispy, with plenty of fried garlic, with the chicken being pretty moist.  Dining is ok, but you get a better price when you get take out rather than dine in. The decor isn't much to look at as it is your typical divey-chinese restaurant.  But there is a steady stream of people coming in and out, so the place is pretty bustling.  The service here is in line with my expectations, which is pretty much leave-you-alone, unless you're waving at them to get the bill or get more tea for the teapot.  Food here is done well, but it isn't stop dead in your tracks amazing, their honey pepper beef with broccoli is pretty good, but it isn't spicy.   The advantage of this place is that it is open fairly late, but they lock the door to the restaurant after a certain time, so if the lights are on, and there are people inside, knock on the door and they'll let you in.  This place is cash only."}
{"text":"In Chinese terms, this restaurant has enough wok flavor.  Meaning very good in wok fried dishes.  The soup is very delicious.  The soy noodle not too oily n very tasty."}
{"text":"It's certainly not an upscale Chinese restaurant and most certainly not a place to take your first date, but hey if you wanna...don't blame me if you're single the next day.  Located in the Bayview Woods Plaza (for those who don't know, it's literally in the middle of the \"woods\" as it's along the Finch Greenbelt), this restaurant is like restaurants you see in HK that focus a lot more on the food than the d√©cor; there literally is no decorations in this restaurant. You can even tell from the outside it looks slightly run down, but it's not terribly so.  As for the food, we had seafood fried chow mein noodle, mixed mushrooms fried ho-fan noodle, fish congee (forgot which kind), and mushrooms mixed with pickle (yes I know, lots of mushrooms). All dishes were decent for the prices (highest was $8.99 for the seafood dish), though the chow mein wasn't cooked for long enough as it was still too crunchy.  Service is...well, it's a Chinese restaurant, service isn't their top priority. As long as you can wave someone down, order, get your food, and ask for the bill, that's all I ask for in terms of these establishments.  I will return if I'm in the area and am interested in low-cost Chinese food that fills your stomach."}
{"text":"Four dish take combo with rice and soup comes out to $40 AFTER tax. That's unbelievable. And the flavouring is great, almost a home cooked taste because they avoid using too much salt. How do they do this at this price? The ingredients aren't the best or freshest.   You can especially tell with the beef and shrimp that they're not using the top products.   Price-wise it's a reliable place for take out on a lazy night. On weekends this place is packed. But quality-wise, you may want to visit other options.   3.5 stars out of 5.  Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food: [*] Disappointing. Just...no.  [**] Not very good. Will not return.  [***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality.  [****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints.  [*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"3.5  If you're looking for a decent Chinese experience without all of the fluff, Sun Star is a place you might want to check out  Pros: Food is pretty good Prices are OK  Cons: Portions are smaller  If you don't know about this place, chances are you will never see it even if you're driving by.  Sun Star is nestled in a little plaza on Finch between Bayview and Leslie.  I found this place because I frequent Maxim which is in the same plaza.  Sun Star is basically your typical old school HK diner.  There is nothing fancy about this place.  You come here to have a good meal and leave.  The food is decent to pretty good and the prices are OK as well.  This is a great place to have a weekly family dinner, but don't come here hoping to impress anyone.  Usual staples we get here are the steamed half chicken, spicy pork chops, garlic bok choi and the green beans.  Like I said, the food is pretty good.  You won't be absolutely amazed, but you will satisfied.  The steamed chicken is actually one of the better ones in the city.  I recommend you get that one if you come here. All meals here come with free soup.  I think once you come here enough, they give you a little something for dessert as well.    One thing to note is the portions here are a little smaller.  When my GF and I go out for Chinese, we usually order 3 dishes and have more than enough left over for lunch the next day.  Coming here, we find we need to order 4 dishes to be able to do the same. If you're a big eater, you'll find you will need to order a little bit more yourself.  If you take out, they have a special where you order from a set of dishes and you get a better price in my opinion.  You also get rice and soup for free if you go that route. I've done take out  many a times because of this myself."}
{"text":"Food in general is pretty good....service isn't.  Prices much too high for the size of the portions which are on the small side.compared to other Chinese restaurants. We have been here 3 times but probably won't return.  We always order enough dishes to have leftovers for the next day...but ordering the same amount of food from Sun Star left us with no leftovers because of the small portions."}
{"text":"My fam has been coming here a lot as there were numerous recommendations (our family doctor and family friends). Weekdays are not that busy but weekends, you may need a reservation.   The price isn't bad at all but other reviewers are correct. You are basically there for the good food. Do not expect much in terms of decor, ambiance, etc.   Our personal fav dishes are their crispy chicken dish (sooo good though i feel the portion is a bit on the small side), taiwanese style spicy mixed, beef with green bean spicy sauce.  Service was good and parking was alright during peak hours."}
{"text":"I thought most of Toronto's chinese restaurants would have an upscale setting--until Sun Star came along. This restaurant resembles those cheaper restaurants in Hong Kong, which is prevalent in most of Chinatown in New York. While the decor may not be appealing, the food is a different take.   It sure is packed in here. Came here on a Sunday night and surprisingly, we had to wait but the wait was quite short. You can tell this place has been in business for quite a while and as you go down to the bathroom, it really, really smells. We had steamed chicken, which I felt were lacking in meat and were cut smaller than normal size. We also had the roasted oysters with garlic and scallions; the oysters were great and fresh but the garlic ans scallions didn't really do much and had very little flavoring, even though there was probably like a teaspoon of minced garlic in each. I don't remember the rest but we also had soy sauce fried noodle, which had plenty of sprouts."}
{"text":"Food and service are very good, my only complain is the very unfriendly washroom. Not recommended for elderlies or  someone with walking difficulties."}
{"text":"Sometimes I just want a simple and affordable Chinese meal, Sun Star Chinese Cuisine is not a bad choice.   You can find all the typical Cantonese dishes at good prices ($7 and up) and the portion is good for small group.   I would not make a special trip to eat here but if you are in the area, it is a good choice for traditional down to earth Chinese food. There's not that many in the area anymore.  Closes at 11 pm but the plaza gets really quiet on weekdays so they lock their front door, just wave and they will let you in!"}
